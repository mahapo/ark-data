This volume contains chapters based on some of the most informative and insightful papers from the conference, which have undergone substantial revision, supplemented by additional essays from authors who were unable to attend the conference but have been invited to contribute to the project in order to give as varied a picture as possible of the visual and symbolic in the history of Western Esotericism. The collection includes material from established figures in the field as well as the work of newer scholars carving out their careers. Thanks must go first and foremost to these authors for the time and effort that they have put into the researching and writing of their essays. Special thanks are due to György Szönyi and all those who assisted in the preparations for the conference, especially Prof. Gábor Szabó, University Rector, who supported the conference and provided the opening venue in the University Palace, as well as to the many scholars and students who attended, contributing to the open, enthusiastic and engaging atmosphere. My warm thanks to Gyorgy Szonyi, Boaz Huss and Wouter Hanegraaff for their assis-tance in the critical review process of the papers. My thanks, too, to Marco Pasi, editor in chief of Aries Book Series, for accepting this collection of essays in the series and to the board and members of the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism for their continued patience and support during the editing of this work. Last, but by no means least, thanks to my partner Punita Miranda, for her fortitude, understanding and loving support during the trials and tribulations of the preparation of this volume.Peter J.

ForshawThe past decades have seen increasing interest from art, cultural and intellec-tual historians, anthropologists, sociologists, and critical theorists in “visual culture”.1 A wide variety of publications have appeared, providing overviews of particular epochs,2 or focusing on specific themes, for instance, visual cultures of science, religion, medicine, and madness.3 This is increasingly the case, too, in scholarly studies of Western Esotericism, encompassing currents of thought that over the centuries – from antiquity to the present day – have amassed their own extremely rich and impressive treasury of visual materials.4On its most literal level what is visual, of course, means our immediate ac-cess to the external world, vision as sense perception, as one of the five physi-cal senses, conveying the images of nature – the mundus sensibilis, sensualis or naturalis – through the eyes to the store-house of the imagination. From there, though, esoteric thought travels to the mundus imaginabilis and mundus intellectualis of early modern neoplatonic and hermetic thinkers like Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) and Robert Fludd (1574–1637), to the mundus imaginalis of Henry Corbin (1903–1978) in the twentieth century.5Profoundly connected with the mundus imaginabilis, the powers of the imagination and images, of course, is the realm of magia, with insightful 1 See, for example, the essays in Jenks (ed.), Visual Culture.2 Gertsman and Stevenson (eds.), Thresholds of Medieval Visual Culture (2012); Cardarelli, An-derson, and Richards (eds.), Art and Identity: Visual Culture, Politics and Religion in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (2012); Kromm and Benforado Bakewell (eds.), A History of Visual Culture: Western Civilization from the 18th to the 21st century (2010).3 Pauwels (ed.)

This is particularly the case with current research on the imagines magicae or talismans in manuscripts like the necromantic Picatrix, Libro de las Formas et de las Ymágenes, and Libro de Astromagia, all produced in the thirteenth-century scriptorium of Alfonso x, El Sabio, King of Castile, Léon, and Galicia (1221–1284).6 Excellent work has been done on the critical reception of such texts in medieval works like the Speculum astronomiae – Mirror of Astronomy (1255–1260), which divided the “Science of Images” (Scientia Imaginum) into 3 kinds (abominable, detestable, and acceptable).7 Despite their condemnation, some of these medieval texts, such as the Picatrix, Almandal of Solomon and Liber sacer sive iuratus Honorii – The Holy or Sworn Book of Honorius, nevertheless attracted the attention of later Renaissance and early modern practitioners, notable examples being the Florentine philosopher Ficino, the German “magical abbot” Johannes Trithe-mius (1483–1506) and the Elizabethan magus, John Dee (1527–1608).8 Scholars of modern Western Esotericism will be well aware of the interest such mate-rial had for members of occult organisations like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.9As is evident in such early modern works as the Bolognese scholar Acchi-le Bocchi’s (1488–1562) Symbolicae Questiones - Books of Symbolic Questions (1555), the term “symbol” (Greek symbolon, symbolos and Latin symbolum) has no simple definition. Derived from the Greek verb symballein, “to join or bring together,” it can signify ‘an object (a Greek token), a verbal construct (such as motto, fable, and riddle), a visual image (the hieroglyph), or a mixed verbal/visual formula (such as emblem and impresa) .’10 Famous examples from antiquity embrace both the verbal Pythagorean aurea dicta and symbola collected by Ficino in the fifteenth century and the geometric and arithmologi-cal symbolism of Pythagoras’s Tetraktys, which, at the time when Jewish Kab-balah was being introduced to the Christian West, became assimilated into the 6 See García Avilés, ‘La cultura visual de la magia en la época de Alfonso x’; Boudet, Caioz-zo, & Weill-Parot (eds.), Images et Magie; Weill-Parot, Les “images astrologiques” au Moyen Âge et à la Renaissance.7 Burnett, ‘Talismans: Magic as Science?

The sixteenth-century popularity of emblemata and hieroglyphica,14 provided the impetus for the flowering of alchemical em-blem books in the early seventeenth century, most impressively in the works of Michael Maier (1568–1622), author of a multitude of works, including the Sym-bola aureae mensae duodecim nationum (1617) and the Atalanta fugiens (1618), with its ambitious combination of 50 images, texts and musical fugues.15 Some alchemical works are indeed almost totally visual, the best-known cases being the scrolls originally attributed to the fifteenth-century English canon George Ripley (c.1415–1490) and the later Mutus Liber or Silent Book (1677). This ma-terial generated a veritable publishing industry of authors devoted to explor-ing and decoding alchemical symbolism, including Antoine Joseph Pernety’s 11 On number symbolism, see Jean-Pierre Brach’s entry in Hanegraaff (ed.), Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism, and Brach, La symbolique des nombres.

Those interested in the his-tory of psychology will doubtless be aware of the resurgence of interest in al-chemical symbolism stimulated by the investigations and theorisations of the psychoanalyst Herbert Silberer (1882–1923) and the psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961).16Lux in Tenebris is a collection of eighteen original and critical interdisci-plinary essays that address the visual and symbolic in Western Esotericism, covering such themes as alchemy, magic, divination, kabbalah, angels, occult philosophy, Platonism, Rosicrucianism, and Theosophy. The title Lux in Ten-ebris, originally used for the esswe conference in Szeged that was the initial impetus behind this collection, has been retained because of the way in which the apostle John’s famous phrase ‘Lux in tenebris lucet’ ( John 1:5 ‘And the light shineth in darkness’) connects with these essays, with Light as a sign of divine incarnation in the darkness of human existence, as the most appropriate met-aphor for the visual depiction of that incarnation of divine Word into mortal flesh, of Logos into Eidos. As such, Saint John’s Gospel is ‘a story about transition from medium to medium, the story of the transition from one way of represen-tation to another and a discussion about various modes of absorption, their nature, and the faith in them.’17 John’s metaphor undoubtedly inspired esoteric thinkers, for we find his phrase in the titles of several early modern works at-tributed, for instance, to the Franciscan philosopher Ramon Lull (1235–1315), to the theosophical magus and alchemist, Heinrich Khunrath (1560–1605), and in the collection of prophetic visions edited and published in Amsterdam in 1657 by the Czech pansophist Jan Amos Comenius (1592–1670).18 Related to all of these is an understanding of John’s phrase in the link between light and knowledge, when voir becomes savoir, the dawn of understanding, the flash of inspiration.19 Finally, in the modern world the light shining in darkness is an apt metaphor for cinema, a medium discussed in one essay in this collection.2016 Silberer, Probleme der Mystik und ihrer Symbolik/Hidden Symboism of Alchemy and the Occult Arts.

For some this means the expression of an occult, emblematic worldview that sees a system of symbolic correspondences linking the heavens above to hu-man beings, animals, plants, minerals, and metals below; theories of relations between macrocosm, mesocosm and microcosm; the ancient notion of a symbo-los or symbolon as a celestial sign portending some future event; or revelatory images received from on high or from within, of the varied inner worlds of esotericism, the visions and visualisations of visionaries, the seeings of scryers and seers, with all their personal, private, shared, initiatory, didactic, polemi-cal, synoptic, revelatory, devotional, sacramental, meditational, and magical uses. The contributors come from an archipelago of scholarly domains: from theology, religious studies, and comparative religion, departments of philoso-phy, the various Histories of Ideas, Philosophy, Religions, Art, and Music, and of course of Western esotericism; some are established figures in their fields, others are new researchers making their mark; all have their own unique per-spectives and original interpretations on their chosen themes, some with a fo-cus on specific significant figures in the history of Western Esotericism, others with an interest in a particular theme.The essays have been arranged chronologically and the volume is divided into two sections:Part 1, focussing on the Middle Ages and Early Modernity, begins with the Spanish kabbalist Joseph Gikatilla (c.1248–c.1305), and includes the fif-teenth-century Florentine philosopher Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), Giulio Camillo (1480–1544) and his famous Memory Theatre, the occult phi-losopher Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535), the Teutonic Theoso-pher, Jacob Böhme (1575–1624), the French religious visionary Paul Yvon (c.1570–1646), and the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), plus papers on the famous Rosicrucian work, The Chemical Wedding (1616), imagery in Weigelianism, Rosicrucian and Christian Theosophy, and on celestial divination in Russia.Part 2 turns to Modernity and Postmodernity, with essays on spe-cific esoteric thinkers: the French occultist René Schwaller de Lubicz (1887–1961) and the Italian esotericist Julius Evola (1898–1974), as well as the relation between esoteric thought and creative process, in literature, art, and cinema, represented here by the British artist and author Ithell Colquhoun (1906–1988), the French neo-impressionist William Degouve de Nuncques (1867–1935), Russian painter and sculptor Grisha Bruskin (b. 1945), and Brazilian artist Stephan Doitschinoff (b. 1977), as well as in"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Forshaw6<UN>the Luciferian engravings in Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s novel El Club Dumas (1993), and the film that was based on it, The Ninth Gate (Roman Polanski, 1999).

Challoner (1894–1987) and Ethelwynne M. Quail. Part 1: Middle Ages and Early ModernityElke Morlok opens this volume of essays with a comparison of the approach to symbol in the writings of one of the most important kabbalists in the Middle Ages, Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla (c. 1248–c.1305), to Neoplatonic parallels found in the thought of Proclus, Iamblichus and others. Gikatilla’s combination of both Neoplatonic and Pythagorean ideas on symbols created a unique syn-thesis in medieval kabbalah with a decisive influence on Western esoterici-sism up to modern theories on language and philosphy. The function of the symbol in the hermeneutic triangle is analysed in both in its visual and its acoustic aspects. Morlok concludes her essay with a look at important devel-opments in the Christian tradition as presented in the works of Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius.Michael Allen’s contribution concerns another important figure in the his-tory of Western esotericism, indeed one intimately familiar with Pythagorean and Neoplatonic thought, the influential Renaissance philosopher Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499). In an essay that explores some of the salient, often hereti-cal implications of Platonic theories of illumination in the writings of Ficino, Allen takes as his starting point the sine qua non for any discussion of visuality, the appearance of light, in this case that originating from the divine command in the third verse of Genesis “Let there be light” – a light before the creation of the lights of the firmament in the fourteenth verse – a light especially signifi-cant for the Renaissance Platonists, as it had earlier been for Augustine and for other Genesis commentators. It prompted them to look beyond the blinding sunlight (the splendor) of the great myth of the cave in Plato’s Republic to con-template the trans-solar lux, the light that was inextricably linked to the mys-terious notion of the divine “glory” that appears in the Bible and that invested Christ at his Transfiguration as it had invested Moses on Sinai.In the following chapter Lina Bolzoni introduces another Italian thinker, Gi-ulio Camillo (c.1480–1544), one of the most famous men of his time, glorified"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"7Introduction<UN>as divine by many; viewed with suspicion as a mere charlatan by others. He traveled the length and breadth of Italy and France in search of patrons willing to finance the Faustian dream of his life – the realization of a universal mem-ory theatre in which one might store, and re-activate at will, all the knowledge contained in a universal mind. Camillo’s theatre represented the realization of a complex synthesis of different philosophical and religious traditions, includ-ing Hermeticism and Kabbalah, was conceived in such a way as to guarantee its mystical powers and effective functioning, and was invested with a secret, semi-divine dimension that permitted the actuation of the three arts of meta-morphosis: eloquence (which acts on words), alchemy (which acts on things), and deification (which acts on the soul of man).Noel Putnik’s contribution considers the idea of ascension, the very core of Camillo’s German contemporary, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa’s (1486–1535) main goal proclaimed in his De occulta philosophia (1533) – the restoration of magic as a particular religious system. This idea, taken either with its magical or spiritual connotations, implies a personal transformation, an ontological shift of one’s position in the so-called Great Chain of Being, during one’s life-time and through one’s own efforts. The conceptual framework of such an idea is based on a complex set of Neoplatonic, Hermetic, and Kabbalistic notions of the macrocosmic universe as a hierarchically structured living being, orga-nized according to different levels of emanation and governed by the laws of correspondences, all reflected in the microcosmic structure of man. Although Agrippa’s vision of his magician’s universe implies a great deal of what is often termed geometria sacra, De occulta philosophia contains practically no visual representations of such a pivotal concept. Putnik’s chapter examines various ways that Agrippa constructs and represents the Renaissance image of the uni-verse in his famous occult compendium through verbal devices alone, with a logocentrism that determines the very nature of his magical theory.The next chapter engages with the theosophy of one of Agrippa’s compatri-ots, the “Teutonic Philosopher” Jacob Böhme (1575–1624). Following on from Putnik’s examination of Agrippa’s logocentrism, Joshua Gentzke considers new hermeneutical strategies being developed within a growing body of schol-arship that treats the role of the senses in the production of knowledge. Such scholarship calls for an “embodied” approach to the humanities that emphasiz-es the complex relationship between culture, history, and sensory experience. Gentzke adopts this orientation in relation to the work of the German mystic, Jacob Böhme (1575–1624). It has often been claimed that Böhme’s thought is deficient in terms of clarity and philosophical sophistication. However, if the experiential and nonpropositional aims of the author are taken seriously, his work appears in a new light. Approaching Böhme’s work as an amalgam of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Forshaw8<UN>both theory and practice, Gentzke first explicates his theorization of the re-lationship between body, image, and imagination; then explores the way in which the notion of “image” (Bild) is both textually and visually performed in Böhme’s imaginary, highlighting the “aesthetic” and “kinaesthetic” dimensions of his theosophy. In closing, he argues that Böhme’s work is neither simply primitive philosophy nor purely speculative mysticism, but rather, performa-tive and prescriptive in nature: an attempt to provide the reader with the “raw materials” needed to imaginatively fashion a virtual body that brings the world of the text to life.Thomas Willard’s chapter begins with the consideration of images that ap-peared during Böhme’s lifetime in one of the most famous Rosicrucian pub-lications, Johann Valentin Andreae’s (1586–1654) Chymische Hochzeit. Willard suggests that these simple illustrations added verisimilitude when the anony-mously submitted manuscript was published in 1616. Rather than give a skilled artisan’s images of scenes in the allegorical story, some showed spatial relations in rough diagrams made up of lines, circles, and letters. Others showed mes-sages written in a secret alphabet and decoded in the text itself – presumably the “magic writing” mentioned in the Confessio Fraternitatis of 1615. The printed book purported to reproduce the bulk of a manuscript that the edi-tor and annotator had seen in its entirety. In addition to fostering the story of Christian Rosencreutz, the illustrations force readers to think of related im-ages in the text – the fountain of Mercury, the crypt of Venus, and the tower of Olympus among others. They indeed suggest that the whole story of a chemi-cal wedding in the year 1459 is a puzzle, in which C. R. is both the narrator and the model puzzle-solver. Not the least of his puzzles is the Hieroglyphic Monad of John Dee (1527–1608/9), affixed to the wedding invitation. It serves as a re-minder that the wedding is an astrological as well as alchemical event and has political as well as personal implications.Theodor Harmsen’s contribution discusses the important part played in the reception history of Valentin Weigel’s (1533–1588) mystical thought within seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Christian theosophy by the imagery in Weigelian, Rosicrucian and Böhmist mystical theologies and theosophies. Vi-sualization of theosophical ideas developed especially in the context of book production although symbolic images were also devised as visual explications of complex ideas and not just as illustrations for frontispieces: Weigel, and Ja-cob Böhme after him, conceived of their own symbols, which were picked up, cited and developed by their followers and sympathizers in books and manu-scripts. Astrological, magical-kabbalist and alchemical elements were adapted and/or combined in order to create more complex images that were related to textual bases in works composed by or attributed to Paracelsus, Weigel,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"9Introduction<UN> Khunrath, Böhme and Franckenberg. The visual symbol appeared increas-ingly independent of the text or texts it had originally accompanied. A strong representative of this trend is the Geheime Figuren der Rosenkreuzer, a com-pendium of theosophical imagery published in Altona in 1785–1788, which is here discussed in relation to authentic and pseudo-Weigelian works (or Wei-gelians). Harmsen analyses a selection of images and traces their reception in Weigelian, Böhmist and Radical Pietist settings, with the argument that these images were given a new context in the manuscript and printed versions of the Geheime Figuren.The following chapter by Carsten Wilke introduces readers to the mathema-tician and religious visionary Paul Yvon, lord of Laleu (c.1570–1646). A Calvin-ist merchant and magistrate of La Rochelle, Yvon claimed to have discovered, by a divine revelation he experienced in 1614, the squaring of the circle and a new Judeo-Christian religion based on scientific intuition. He dedicated a large number of printed pamphlets to his mathematical theorems and, having moved to Paris after his conversion to Catholicism in 1628, insistently tried to convince Marin Mersenne, René Descartes and other contemporaries of their veracity. Taking a close look at complex geometric diagrams that appear as il-lustrations in some Yvon’s publications, Wilke discusses possible coherence between geometrical proof and Kabbalistic myth. These copper-plate engrav-ings contain short formula in Hebrew and a few figurative symbols, among which the snake, the sun, and the vagina are particularly recurrent, alluding to cosmological and Christological mysteries of which Yvon believed himself to be the prophet. Wilke wrily argues that Yvon’s main historic interest resides in his pushing to the extreme the fascination with Jewish esotericism that characterized the early stages of the scientific revolution and that earned him among his contemporaries the reputation of being not only a madman, but also a Judaizer.The following two chapters move forward in time to the eighteenth-century works of the Swedish scientist, philosopher and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772). In the first essay, Susanna Åkerman investigates the possible influ-ence of Kabbalah on his thought, given a certain phenomenological similarity in the two cosmologies. She points to the shared notions of upper (celestial and spiritual) and lower (natural) worlds; an influx from the celestial world into the lower worlds; the presence of spirits and angels; emphasis on the Old Testament text and its inner dimension; and suggests that the Sephirotic tree of Kabbalah, taken as Adam Kadmon, is similar to Swedenborg’s postulation of the Grand human forming the heavens in communities of souls. Although it has recently been argued that Swedenborg as a rationalist gained these spe-cific ideas from contemporaries, such as the German cosmologist Andreas"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Forshaw10<UN> Rüdiger’s Physica divina, recta via (1716), she draws the reader’s attention to the existence of a small dissertation in the Swedenborg Library in Gröndal, Stock-holm, with the signature “Emanuel Svedberg” on its title plate. This is the Dis-sertatio historico-philologico de sapientia Salomonis (Uppsala, 1705) by David Lundius (1657–1729), Hebraist at Uppsala University, treating of the wisdom of Solomon, in which Kabbalist ideas are discussed in broad terms. Apparently, Swedenborg acquired it as a young student in Uppsala. Guided by this work, Åkerman’s chapter explores similarities between Swedenborg’s writings and the Kabbalah.In the following chapter Francesca Maria Crasta and Laura Follesa discuss Swedenborg’s De cultu et amore Dei (1745). In this work, which is complex from both a philosophical and a linguistic standpoint, metaphors and allegories, which draw on both classical and modern literary traditions, are combined with symbolic structures which, by contrast, have a mystical or esoteric na-ture. Swedenborg’s work thus presents an extraordinary opportunity to assess the double functionality of symbols, metaphors and metonymies in a philo-sophical and theological context. As Inge Jonsson has pointed out (Drama of Creation, 2004), these images have a poetical and a literary dimension. How-ever, within Swedenborg’s text, they acquire a richer meaning, which recalls Neoplatonic, hermetic and cabalistic sources. The primordial or cosmic egg, the “edenic state” or state of nature and the Tree of Life are all symbolic repre-sentations that strongly characterize Swedenborg’s thought and that refer to the tradition of Western esotericism. Crasta and Follesa argue that these sym-bols play not only a heuristic role but can also be used in a pedagogical sense to explain the most distant past of both the earth and man, a past that cannot be scientifically proved, but only represented by means of topoi and the mythical forms produced by the collective imaginary of mankind. Their chapter argues that Swedenborg’s symbolic images are not simply visual representations of the past, but have an esoteric and visionary dimension that goes far beyond the boundaries of traditional iconography.In the final chapter of the medieval and early modern part of the volume, Robert Collis provides the first in-depth analysis of the richly illustrated Tobol’sk Chronicle, or A Record of Astronomical Phenomena of Various Ages, which was compiled in the Siberian city between 1695 and 1734. The chronicle not only incorporates a fascinating record of comets, meteors, eclipses and out-of-the-ordinary weather witnessed above Tobol’sk itself, but also draws on older Russian chronicles in order to interpret and document the effects of such phenomena on Muscovy and its near neighbours since the reign of Ivan iv (1530–1584). In this sense, the chronicle served to incorporate Tobol’sk (and Siberia as a whole) within the geographical and spiritual parameters of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"11Introduction<UN>the Russian Orthodox Empire. Moreover, the compiler(s) of the chronicle also cited Biblical precedents, as well as Flavius Josephus and Dionysius the Areop-agite, in order to frame the work as a whole firmly within the realm of Christian providentialism. In other words it sought to provide a comprehensive discourse that portrays all phenomena in relation to a single, omnipotent God, who uses a “language” of signs in order to speak to humanity through extraordinary occurrences. With brief introductory sections on Christian providentialism and celestial divination in European and Russian history, Collis’s chapter moves on to examine the text and accompanying illustrations contained with-in the Tobol’sk Chronicle, thereby providing an in-depth analysis of the work and an assessment of early modern Russian attitudes towards celestial divination. Part 2: Modernity and PostmodernityThe second part of this volume, that dealing with modernity, opens with Györ-gy Szönyi’s chapter on changing perceptions of the prophet Enoch. The discov-ery of the Ethiopic Book of Enoch in the late eighteenth century by the Scottish traveller, James Bruce (1730–1794), and its publication in English by Richard Laurence in 1821 rekindled the interest in the biblical forefather. In Victorian England one finds a whole range of reflections on Enoch from theological tracts, philological speculations, through literary works, to esoteric visions and occult references. Notable examples are Madame Blavatsky’s and John Mason Neale’s Enochian references, Edward Vaughan Kenealy’s Enoch, the Messenger of God, and LeRoy Hooker’s 1898 esoteric novel, Enoch the Philistine. Szonyi’s chapter surveys these various cultural representations, with an eye on Aleister Crowley’s Enochian magic, through which he aimed to revolutionize occult practices in the early twentieth century.Aaron Cheak’s contribution discusses the life and work of the Alsatian artist, alchemist, Egyptologist, Neopythagorean, and philosopher René ‘Aor’ Schwaller de Lubicz (1887–1961). His life’s work encompassed a surprisingly diverse spectrum of activity, from the creation of alchemically stained glass to the archaeology, architectonics and symbolic analysis of Egyptian temples. Cheak argues that, taken in its entirety, the esotericism of de Lubicz is noth-ing less than a science of consciousness and it is within this framework that he situates Schwaller’s approach to symbolism. This chapter focuses on three interrelated ideas in Schwaller’s œuvre: (1) the concept of symbolique, in which the phenomenal cosmos is perceived as a reaction to metaphysical processes; (2) the basis of this idea in the alchemical theory of sulphur, mercury and salt;"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Forshaw12<UN>and (3) Schwaller’s conception of the alchemical stone as a ‘juncture of tran-scendence and concretion’.The following chapter, Thomas Hakl’s essay on symbology in the works of the Italian philosopher and esotericist Julius Evola (1898–1974), aims to show that for Evola symbols are genuine “windows” into transcendent reality in the Platonic sense. As such symbols constitute a link to this reality. One can be transformed by their use and thus they can constitute a path of spiritual devel-opment. For Evola these symbols are not man-made but part of an ancient and forgotten traditional wisdom, one with the aim of deificatio, of becoming god, a notion found in the works of figures like Meister Eckhart, with parallels in earlier treatises like the Corpus Hermeticum. Evola learnt these ideas among others from the Italian Renaissance hermeticist Cesare della Riviera, whose main work Il mondo magico degli Heroi (1605) Evola edited and commented on. These hermetic ideas of Evola greatly influenced the Romanian philosopher and historian of religion Mircea Eliade (1907–1986) and found the approval of the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961). Evola’s significance ex-tends beyond the theoretical, however, for he used the powers of these sym-bols in the magical ur Group over which he presided in the years 1927–1929.Victoria Ferentinou’s contribution considers the association between art and spirituality, in particular its re-emergence at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries during the occult revival, which had a considerable impact on modernist artists from the symbolists to the surreal-ists. Ferentinou’s case study is the British-born Ithell Colquhoun (1906–1988), a surrealist painter, writer and poet but also a practising occultist. Colquhoun studied esoteric philosophy and joined occult sects that thrived in Great Brit-ain in the twentieth century. Her probing of esotericism involved diverse currents, including alchemy, astrology, the Kabbalah, Gnosticism, magic, the Tarot, Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, Neoplatonism, Christian mysticism and Celtic lore. Ferentinou’s chapter focuses on the influence that alchemical sym-bolism exerted upon Colquhoun’s artistic production, identifying several of her sources from her private collection of esoteric books. It particularly explores the notion of the conjunction of opposites in the personal artistic language formulated by Colquhoun, laying emphasis on the various manifestations of the concept in paintings and writings from the 1940s and 1950s. Colquhoun experimented with the polyvalent and cryptic lexicon of alchemy but also in-vented her own iconography, relying upon the correlation between occultism and psychology in vogue at the time. This chapter considers Colquhoun’s ar-cane and psychological research alongside her work, providing an insight into her perspective on the alchemical quest primarily as a spiritual practice."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"13Introduction<UN>In his chapter Jonathan Schorsch presents three case studies of the way in which esoteric themes appear and become revised in the work of mod-ern visual artists who make use of angels. The French neo-impressionist Wil-liam Degouve de Nuncques’s (1867–1935) painting, Angels of the Night, offers a brooding symbolist setting that I read as a narrative drawn from esoteric motifs regarding human transformation between divinity and mortality. In his paintings and sculptures, Russian painter and sculptor Grisha Bruskin (b. 1945) considers Jewish identity by means of kabbalistic themes, whose visual strangeness and conceptual metaphysics he uses to open up possibilities both spiritual and political within Soviet tyranny and post-Soviet western anomie and ennui. The Brazilian artist Stephan Doitschinoff (b. 1977) wields alchemi-cal graphics and ideas in his postmodern pop art, stimulating an imaginary of hope, even inspiration, while challenging the ills of the contemporary west. These artists and their angels serve as examples of the surprising persistence of angels in modernity. A means of working through anxieties regarding the de-stabilized boundaries between human and divine, human and animal, human and machine, they have left official religious tradition behind, have become gnostic, neo-kabbalistic ciphers for and of a humanity attempting to transcend its limitations while yet reveling in them, have become totems and mentors in varying pantheons of (post-)modern (imaginary) beings such as celebrities, superheroes, creatures from fantasy novels and gaming worlds. They stand as allusions to in-betweenness and uncertainty regarding the anti-metaphysical progressivism of scientific modernity, communist and capitalist alike.Continuing with the artistic, but this time in the realm of fiction and cin-ematography, Per Faxneld’s chapter analyzes the function of esoteric sym-bolism, specifically the imagery in a series of luciferian engravings, in Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s novel El Club Dumas (1993), and the film that was based on it, The Ninth Gate (Roman Polanski, 1999). Faxneld’s argument is that the frag-mentation of the images in the novel, where it becomes impossible to reach the “ur-images”, is something which comments on the postmodern condi-tion and a perceived shattering of grand narratives and objective divine (or diabolic) truths. Signs and symbols become unstable and polyphonic floating signifiers. This renders the esoteric enlightenment, the single “true” meaning of the symbols, impossible to reach. The novel’s protagonist, Lucas Corso, is helped by Lucifer to accept this, and to realize it sets him free: the absence of a limiting pre-scripted esoteric metanarrative enables him to create his own narrative as he embraces the liberty that the postmodern condition brings. Possibly with inspiration from Roland Barthes’ well-known 1968 essay ‘La mort de l’auteur’, in Pérez-Reverte’s novel the metaphoric death of the “author”, and"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Forshaw14<UN>the dissipation of his one true narrative, frees the “reader” of esoteric signs and symbols, Corso, and lets him be reborn as a “creator god”. Polanski’s film, on the other hand, retains the benevolent Lucifer (who takes the shape of a woman), but here she instead acts as an initiator into a more classic esoteric enlighten-ment, where the engravings are ultimately restored to their pristine condition and their riddle solved, dispelling the threat of postmodern dissolution of the symbolic.The final chapter of this collection of essays, a longue durée piece by Josce-lyn Godwin, concerns the history of color symbolism as an example of the im-pact of science on esotericism. Before the Scientific Revolution, esoteric color schemes followed the doctrine of correspondences (e.g., the seven heraldic tinctures linked to the planets and subsequent schemes of Ficino, Paracelsus, Jacob Böhme, Fludd, and Kircher) or drew on alchemical and biblical symbol-ism. After 1700 most esotericists, whether or not they accepted Isaac Newton’s spectrum, tried to harmonize their theories with scientific data and empirical methods (e.g., Goethe, Runge, Wronski, French neo-Pythagoreans, Hermeti-cists, and Theosophists). The early twentieth century saw a proliferation of color theories on the borderline between esotericism and artistic practice, to-gether with psychological and therapeutic applications (e.g., neo-Theosophy, Golden Dawn, Kandinsky, Kupka, Steiner, and Itten). In contrast, Portal’s Des couleurs symboliques (1857) influenced Guénon and other Traditionalists to re-assert the simpler and more symbolic medieval and Islamic categories.BibliographyBath, Michael, Speaking Pictures: English Emblem Books and Renaissance Culture, Lon-don and New York: Longman 1994.Bauduin, Tessel M., Surrealism and the Occult: Occultism and Western Esotericism in the Work and Movement of André Breton, Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press 2014.Bauduin, Tessel M. and Nina Kokkinen (eds.), Aries Special issue on Occulture, Vol. 13, No. 1.

Joseph Gikatilla’s Hermeneutics, Tübingen 2011.chapter 1Visual and Acoustic Symbols in Gikatilla, Neoplatonic and Pythagorean Thought*Elke MorlokIn modern scholarship on kabbalistic literature the topic of kabbalistic symbol and symbolism is closely connected to visual aspects1 and the function of the symbol has been intensely discussed in scholarship since Gershom Scholem’s pioneering works. Scholem defines the symbol as a representative of an oc-cult, hidden entity or process, which is not revealed by itself and which cannot be expressed directly.2 Such a radical transcendence of the referent to which the symbol points has been challenged by modern academic research, where the symbol rather reflects dynamic processes within the divine realm and has become a factor of correspondence between the divine-human or ontological-linguistic sphere, sometimes described even as functional correspondences between the sefirot and human limbs.3 One of the most important authors of kabbalistic thinking in the last third of the 13th century in Spain is R. Joseph Gikatilla (1248–1305). Spending his youth learning Abraham Abulafia’s4 inter-pretation of Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed, he later turned like his con-temporary Moshe de Leon to the theosophic-theurgic branch of kabbalah and was most probably one of the authors of the Zohar.5 The idea of correspon-dence is true for his main opus, Sha‘arei ’Orah - Gates of Light, where Gikatilla defines both the biblical text and the sefirotic world as a web of names and 1 Wolfson, Through a Speculum; idem, Language, Eros, Being; Scholem, On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism; idem, Name of God.2 Scholem, Major Trends, 25–28.3 Talmage, ‘Apples of Gold’; Huss, ‘Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla’s Definition of Symbolism’; Idel, Kab-balah; idem, ‘Function of Symbols’.4 On this author as the founder of the linguistic-ecstatic branch of medieval kabbalah see the numerous works of Moshe Idel, e.g. The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia; idem, Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah; idem, Language, Torah, and Hermeneutics in Abraham Abula-fia; and Wolfson, Abraham Abulafia – Kabbalist and Prophet.

The pronouncing of words plays a significant role in the definition of the symbol, the siman, in Gikatilla’s model. We find the symbolic leitmotif already in the introduc-tion of Sha‘arei ’Orah from Ps. 91, 14: ‘I will keep him safe, since he knows My name. When he calls on Me, I will answer him.’ We discover in Gikatilla’s use of siman and its function within the hermeneutical process various ideas from both Pythagorean and Neoplatonic backgrounds, but in both periods of Gi-katilla’s literary activity, the linguistic and the theosophic-theurgic period,8 also the acoustic element9 shows an important aspect for his application of siman: either within its use as heshbon (sum of each letter in a Hebrew word, gematria)10 in Ginnat ’Egoz - The Nut Garden or later in Sha‘arei ’Orah when it is applied as a performative constellative factor of the text.1 Ginnat ’Egoz, Neoplatonic and Pythagorean IdeasIn Ginnat ’Egoz, siman (sign) is used as a synonym for heshbon (sum, calcu-lation) and it initiates the intellectual process of letter combination (tzeruf ’Otiyyot), which finally leads to intellection of the divine realm via language.11 6 Ibid., 17, 294, 297.7 Ibid., 66, 84f, 232–238 and Index; Garb, ‘Powers of Language’; Idel, ‘Voiced Text’; Liebes, ‘Angels of the Shofar’.8 Morlok, Art. ‘Gikatilla’, 86–88.9 On the acoustic performance, the sound of the voice that remedies the inanimate and silent nature of writing in Plato’s Phaedrus see J. Svenbro, Phrasikleia, 45, 62–63, 164. We should definitely compare this idea with Gikatilla’s passage at the end of Sha‘ar haNiqqud, where the knowledge of the inner structure of words becomes the remedies for one’s soul. See also Sha‘arei ’Orah i: 94. The acoustic aspect should also be compared to Gikatilla’s ideas on the acoustic performance of the ritual as a condition for the mystical experience; see also Morlok, R. Joseph Gikatilla’s Hermeneutics, 28, 55, 146, 168, 218, 303.10 Morlok, R.

For Iamblichus, mathematics is considered to pre-pare the soul for the study of intelligibles by habituating it to the immaterial, purifying and strengthening it for the transition to pure being. In De communi mathematica scientia12 61, 22–8 Iamblichus describes five principles according to which he anticipates the study of intelligibles: (a) common rational prin-ciples, (b) a dim imagining of pure beings in numbers, (c) similarity, (d) resem-blance between model (beings) and image (number) and (e) causation, the relation between cause (being) and effect (number).13 A similar function of tzerufei ’Otiyyot (permutations of letters) is found in Ginnat ’Egoz.14The linguistic activity of tzerufei ’Otiyyot in Gikatilla’s early work seems to have a protreptic function towards divine insight, similar to that of mathemat-ics in Neoplatonic thought. Although in both periods of Gikatilla’s writings the term seder (order)15 has an important function, he adduces different aspects of this term both in his early and in his late literary creative periods. Siman (sign, sum) and seder (order) are closely interconnected both in Gikatilla’s writings and in Pythagorean philosophy.16 In Ginnat ’Egoz the linguistic microcosmic order comes into focus, whereas in Sha‘arei ’Orah Gikatilla is more concerned with the sefirotic divine order and its relation to the biblical text. In his later work, the reader is able to reestablish the inner divine order and gain access to this world in order to repair it and gain influx from above. In this linguistic-ontological process described in Sha‘arei ’Orah every biblical word is regarded as a divine name, as it refers to one single sefira in the divine constellation and 12 Ed. N.

The ten sefirot correspond to the ten divine names in the Hebrew Bible and all the other words in the Bible are cognomens or cognomens of the cognomens in a linguistic-ontological net or tree.17 What unites the divine names, i.e., the simanim (here name corresponds to sign), in Ginnat ’Egoz is gematria (the numerical value of each word), where-as in Sha‘arei ’Orah it is the ritual act performed by the kabbalist or the Knesset Israel as demonstrated in the fifth gate of Sha‘arei ’Orah. The one who unites the two worlds is according to Gikatilla the tzaddiq and/or the theurge.18On the other hand, Gikatilla, also transmits this creative knowledge of the linguistic realm, namely his ideas on tzerufei ’Otiyyot in Pythagorean terms. The expression in Ginnat ’Egoz, (p. 292): ‘ha‘olam mitnaheg ‘al yesod heshbon’ (the world operates according to the principle of calculation) has a Pythagorean character with an ordered cosmos as the basic principle.19 With the Tetraktys as defined by Pythagoras as a symbol for cosmogenesis,20 and its numerical relations, the Pythagoreans postulate number as the basic principle of the uni-verse. Number constitutes the basis not only of the material world, but also of the divine sphere.21 According to Iamblichus, the embodiment of the soul and its perfection in theurgy is defined as essential to cosmogenesis.22 Adela Yarbro Collins has already shown possible points of contact between Judaism and the Pythagorean tradition in Philo and apocalyptic Jewish literature, especially in 1 Enoch and the Testament of Abraham.23On such an ancient background, Gikatilla combines this ‘science of num-bers’ with his teacher’s, Barukh Togarmi’s, ideas on gematria and the divine name, putting the divine name above the mathematical system/order;24 17 Morlok, ‘Text als Textur bei Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla und in der Kabbala Denudata’.18 Cf.

The “simple sense” (pshat) no longer has any function in Gikatilla’s new narrative; only the single words and the atomized numerical number remain of value for the mystic exegete. Neoplatonic StrainsGikatilla’s concept of linguistic emanation from the highest realm is under-stood in such a way that a linguistic origin of our reality, which is a reflection of this higher world here below, emanates from above. Such a concept reminds us of similar theories on language as presented in Proclus’ Commentary on Parmenides.28We could describe the magic influence from the upper, linguistic realm of the names, as an emanation or a chain (shalshelet)29 which ends down on earth with an action changing the natural order of the universe.30 In contrast to Abraham Ibn Ezra (1089-c.1164/7) and Yehuda Halevi (1075–1141), Gikatilla adds another level to this system, an upper realm of language, which contains 25 In an unpublished lecture Cornford once admitted about the Italian school of Pythago-reanism: ‘The antagonism of the many is harmonized and held together by philia in its unity.’ Guthrie goes on to comment on this: ‘Here his [Cornford’s] words set one wonder-ing whether the unity which the Pythagoreans exalted as divine, and held forth as an example for men to follow, was perhaps not an arche in the full Milesian sense but rather ... the unity of the complete and perfect cosmos, which because it is a harmonia deserves above all things the name of God. ... The cosmos, by virtue of its ordered and beautiful (that is cosmic) nature, is divine. The good is in the end, the telos, not the arche in the sense of the beginning’, Guthrie, History of Greek Philosophy i, 250–251; cf. Aristotle, Meta-physica 1072b 30. Also in Gikatilla’s thought the perfect order and unity lie in the result of the intellectual activity, not in its beginning.26 On ritual, ecstasy and soul in Pythagorean thought, see Thom, Pythagorean Golden Verses, 176–177; cf. also Burkert, Lore and Science, 357; and idem, ‘Das Proömium des Parmenides und die Katabasis des Pythagoras’, 1–30.27 Merlan, From Platonism to Neoplatonism, 18.28 Cf.

According to Gikatilla, Adam “gave” (Hebrew qarah, called) names to phenomena after understanding their true nature – the se-cret orders of the universe. It is on this level that the magician has to exer-cise his influence and bring down the influx from above. Such a phenomenon is well testified in the writings of Neoplatonic philosophers like Iamblichus, where sound also plays an important role in bringing down the emanation from above.31Also in Ginnat ’Egoz, the tiqqun (correction, perfection) has as its object the proper pronunciation of the divine name, from where the magic influence is initiated, as we read at the end of Ginnat ’Egoz (p. 294): ‘My brother, you should know that in fact when an adjuration is correctly stated it binds the supernal [forces] so that they are obligated to fulfill it. And when the blessed Name is pronounced in a worthy fashion it never returns bereft [of blessing] but suc-ceeds in that for which it has been sent.’As indicated before, in Gikatilla’s earlier period, his use of siman is clearly defined as the numerical value of a word or a name, its sum (heshbon). In this function, it becomes a synonym for sod (secret) in Ginnat ’Egoz (p. 27):The beginning of what you must know and contemplate is to guard the world by the ways of the tradition (qabbalah), and the sign (siman) that contains every word (tevah) wherever you need it. Know that the sign (siman) of the name yhwh is for the world. And the sign of these two letters in their designations is kaph (100), waw (12), which amount to 112, their secret is yqb: ‘He even hewed a wine press (yqb = 112) in it.’ (Is. 5: 2), or as is said (Gen. 32:33): ‘He crossed the ford of Jabbok (ybq = 112)’.Gikatilla defines here a kabbalistic way of exegesis as the numerical value of a word, including all different meanings of other words with the same value. Similarly, he may, through this linguistic technique, transfer the Tetragram-maton to other biblical verses, where it is not mentioned explicitly. yhwh has the value of 26, which is in letters kaph-waw. These two letters in their plene form make up 112, according to the ‘name of the letters’, the second value of each word, which can also be reached by the letter combination yaqav or yabaq. These two combinations are identified as the divine name with the help of their numerical value 112, now introduced with the term sod (secret/sum).31 De Mysteriis 259.4ff (iii, 28; v, 26; Vii, 5).

In its correct interpretation the siman as the numerical value heshbon becomes the sod and the mystic may penetrate into the deeper levels of the biblical text in its emanation from the divine source. This permutation (galgal)32 of different numerical equations as a key to ex-egesis is the basic intellectual knowledge that the initiated have to acquire in order to reach the depths of the divine text. With the help of such linguistic techniques, the mystic is able to transfer the entire Torah and the command-ments to an intellectual level, where he may recreate his own universe by the performance of various linguistic manipulative acts. The symbol or sign has become a crystallization point (or a vowel-point), which symbolizes the entire universe.Emanation and sign are connected in the next passage of Ginnat ’Egoz (pp. 27–28):And after we have instructed you about the sign (siman, sum) that ac-counts for the unique Name, we have to come back and initiate you how all His other names, blessed be He, emanate (nimshakhim) from the true essence of the unique Name and how they are attracted to Him (‘elaw teshuqatam), yhwh and its sign is 26, whose sign is 112, whose sign is 1231. And after we have let you know the secret of these signs in detail, we enter into the order of the emanation (hamshakhah) of the other names, how they emanate from the power of the unique Name.By gematria the siman of the divine names is defined, and this leads to the se-cret of its emanation from the Tetragrammaton. The ‘system of numbers’ and emanation also have an acoustic aspect as described by Shlomo Pines with reference to the Indian background of the number theory of ten and the idea of expansion and return in Sefer Yetzirah - Book of Formation:33 ‘The theory it [Sefer Yetzirah] sets forth is concerned both with the sounds represented by the letters and with the letters themselves, regarded as written symbols’. Visual and acoustic aspects are closely interlinked like in Aristotle’s definition of names (onoma) as symbols, which are not the same for all, neither writ-ten nor expressed in spoken sounds, in the beginning of De Interpretatione (16a26–28). Spoken sounds are symbols of affections in the soul and written 32 Cf. Ginnat ’Egoz, 410; Morlok, R. Joseph Gikatilla’s Hermeneutics, 223–225.33 Pines, ‘Points of Similarity’, 125."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Morlok28<UN>marks symbols of spoken sounds. And just as written marks are not the same for all men, neither are spoken sounds – the well known distinction between nature and convention. But what these are in the first place signs of – affections of the soul – are the same for all. According to Gikatilla, for the initiated kab-balists, gematrical exegesis leads to the intellection of the entire biblical text in its numerical values and the revelation of their true sound.34 Therefore the reduction to numbers of the divine names and the biblical narrative as a whole allows the transference of the words and tales on an intellectual level and the linguistic universe of the mystic, where he may re-create a new reality in mysti-cal contemplation, obtained with the help of linguistic methods.2 Symbol/Siman as Entry-TokenThe practice of using seals for entering another level of the celestial hierar-chy in the Hekhalot texts is well testified.35 In his ascent, R. Nehunya shows seals to the gate-keepers in order to pass from one level to the next. However, Naomi Janowitz has shown that sealing is not so much an ascent technique as a protective device used to negotiate the heavens once the mystic has entered the heavenly realm.36 As in Ginnat ’Egoz we do not face an ascent through a heavenly hierarchy but rather the reader’s entry into specific linguistic exege-sis, I am inclined to move the meaning of siman in this treatise closer to the Pythagorean use as entry-token for interpretation than to the meaning of “seal” in the Hekhalot texts.The shared knowledge of the galgal (sphere) as a basic sociological ground for the initiated is expressed in the Notarikon (acronym by using the initial let-ters) galgal (originally “wheel”) as “gam li gam lekha” (both [not] for me and for you) in the second part of Ginnat ’Egoz (p. 410). In this context, Gikatilla speaks of Notarikon as siman qavu‘a (fixed sign/symbol): Linguistic exegesis according 34 Morlok, R. Joseph Gikatilla’s Hermeneutics, 163, 223.35 Scholem notes that the Hebrew term is parallel to the Greek sphragis, Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkavah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition, 133. I might suggest, however, that also the Greek term semeion with its meaning of entry-token is mirrored by the con-cept of seal.

We could call the siman an entry-code for mystical exegesis leading to a state of prophecy as stated at the end of Ginnat ’Egoz, p. 411:37And because of this fact we know how to enter into the other books (se-farim) by investigating the revealed secrets of religion (sitre haDat).

To uncover the secrets of faith is to fulfill the prophetic promise on a purely intellectual level and to return to true Israelite faith. The entry-code for such exegetical activities is the linguistic techniques elaborated upon in this book. These are called siman and lead to the unveiling of the sodot of true faith. This act is also connected to magic implications of the siman in Ginnat ’Egoz.38According to Pythagorean theory a vital aspect of the symbol is the way of recognizing the value to which the sign allows entrance. The symbol gets new meaning by being the decisive step towards salvation, mostly in a mysti-cal ritual act of transformation/divination or rebirth. In this function, symbol serves as a sacrament in the salvific chain. In specific contexts – in the myster-ies, Pythagorean philosophy, and divination – it facilitates the move from the marker of social agreements to a pivotal category in the literary imagination of the postclassical ancient world.39 This move shifts from the sign, semeion, into the respective categories out of which the more general uses have been grown 37 Cf.

Knowledge of the symbols grants one’s identity as a Pythagorean initiate, admitting the holder to certain privileges and opening access to various levels of the Pythagorean cult of wisdom. The Pythagorean symbol serves as a token of identity for the followers of Pythago-ras’ tenets and Iamblichus tells us that the symbols were a kind of secret code (Life of Pythagoras, 227): ‘If outsiders, the profane, so to speak, were present, the Pythagoreans spoke to each other in enigmatic symbols. Familiar phrases still bear a trace of this: “don’t poke fire with a knife”, and other such.’The Pythagorean context transfers the term symbol from its strict classical role of authentication to one of a label for enigmatic language carrying a veiled significance. The long and storied history of the symbol as a mode of obscure discourse was in no small part initiated because certain ancient identity to-kens happened to be enigmatic riddles. ‘The power of the symbol is born out of the power of the secret’.42 We are reminded here of Gikatilla’s equation of siman with sod.In magical-ritual traditions, symbola are equated with synthemata (token) and epodai (magic spells). Very often they function as a word that gives access to the field of the blessed or a formula that the initiate utters to the guard. We find acoustic examples for this in Nicomachus of Gerasa,43 when he deals with a theory of analogous relation between the vowels and the consonants in a theurgical-magical context, theurgists using phonetic sounds.44The symbol became a divine omen and a special kind of identity token among Pythagoreans and devotees of the mysteries, for whom it was an enig-matic epigram or a divine name that carried a hidden message. Such cases testify directly to a hidden surplus of meaning that can be decoded by a skilled interpreter. A similar idea can be seen in Gikatilla’s use of the word siman in Ginnat ’Egoz. The surplus is expressed in the gematrial use and is leading to the 40 A helpful stemma for many of the known Pythagorean symbola is provided by Burkert, Lore and Science, 166–173.

The aim of the ascent is the union with the divine root,49 the Tetragrammaton, as described in the fifth gate of Sha‘arei 45 Morlok, R. Joseph Gikatilla’s Hermeneutics, 228.46 Cf.

He will be silent and yearn for him and desire to cleave to him by reason of his knowledge of his names, blessed be He, and then he will be close to yhwh and his prayer will be accepted. And about this it is said: ‘I will keep him safe, for he knows My name; when he calls on Me, I will answer him’ (Ps. 91:14–15).The correct knowledge of the names is the conditio sine qua non for the mys-tic’s ascent in prayer52 and finally his devequt (cleaving) with the divine via the names, which might be compared to Plato’s idea in the Phaedrus, where the sound of the voice completes the inanimate writing. Without the acoustic sound the writing remains incomplete. The communion between the human and the divine is based ultimately on a correspondence of structure between the human and the divine forms, indicated by the word siman (symbol). Simi-lar to R. Isaac of Acre’s description53 of the exegetical wandering during prayer, the mental tour through the divine architectonics starts with the lower sefirot and ascends to the higher. The ascending hierarchy that informs the mental process related to the liturgical ritual is described in Sha‘arei ’Orah in the de-scending theogonic hierarchy, which correlates with the weaving metaphor.54 The verse from Ps. 91 is then divided into two parts and explained within this context:Scripture does not say ‘I will keep him safe, because he remembers (zkr) My name’, but ‘because he knows My Name’– the knowledge is the 50 Sha‘arei ’Orah i: 218–219; cf.

Since what he asks for is dependent on that Name, then ‘I will answer him’.After mentioning several biblical figures and their effective prayers with vari-ous divine names, Gikatilla goes on in Sha‘arei ’Orah i: 47–48:And although they have interpreted what they have stated about this in Berakhot (31b), it still has an inner essence and [secret] root, so ‘I have not come to regale you with variant interpretations, but rather to give the ultimate meaning’ (Levush Rabbi Ezra 23).Gikatilla sets out the conditions for effective magical prayer based on correct knowledge of the sefirotic system and its reference to the biblical text, i.e., the divine names, introduced by the term siman. What he calls in Sha‘ar haNiqqud (The Gate of Vowels) the “inner chemical structure”55 of the words, is referred to in this passage as “iqqar weShoresh pnimi” (essence and secret root) of the words. With the “correct” intention during prayer, the mystic may activate the divine energy within the linguistic structure and obtain a theurgic effect on high.56The final aim of prayer and initiation into the sefirotic structure is the un-derstanding of the Torah as woven on the Tetragrammaton and the cleaving to this name, where the correlation between name and sefira is defined by the siman. We might call this also a ‘net effect’ of prayer, as Wolfson shows:5755 See Sefer ’Arzei Levanon, Venice 1601, fol. 39b, where only by true knowledge of the inner fabric of each letter may the kabbalist reach the highest state of knowledge, prophecy, and obtain healing for his soul. Only after a deconstruction of the biblical text, which par-allels the analysis of the ingredients of each medical formula, may the mystic reconstruct the text in new units. This combination of the ingredients for effective use enables the mystic to reach the state of being under divine influx.56 The naturalness of Hebrew as the divine language is stressed simultaneously, as it is only within Hebrew words that the mystic can activate the divine element – according to the nature (teva’) of the remedy – within the words and he may gain the desired effect. This idea is a basic presupposition of magical practice, both in Greco-Roman antiquity and elsewhere. See Dillon, ‘Magical Power of Names’, 203, 215; cf. also Plotinus Enn. iv, 40, 6–7, where he states that nature itself is the primal magician (ho goes ho protos kai phar-makeus). The healing effect of the magician (pharmakeus) on at least the irrational part of the soul lies in the utterances of the words, performed with the proper gestures and intonations and the principles of sympatheia.57 Wolfson, ‘Mystical-Theurgical Dimension of Prayer’, 59."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Morlok34<UN>Prayer is typically perceived as ‘the product of man’s yearning for the most intimate of all human communications, for the opportunity to open his heart and his mind in adoration and supplication to the divine presence’. Whether the roots of this twofold yearning are found in man’s sense of insufficiency or in a sense of wonder about the mystery of life, the net ef-fect is the same: prayer originates in and is sustained by the deep gap that separates infinite and finite. The act of prayer is precisely the bridge that attempts to overcome the boundary separating man and God.At the end of Sha‘arei ’Orah, within the definition of the explicatio of the bibli-cal text as a texture woven on names and cognomina, Gikatilla comes back both to the verse from Ps. 91 and to the inherent conplicatio of the biblical text. In the latter, the different modes of the sefirotic order correspond to the dif-ferent modes of the divine names in the human understanding of the woven texture, which is construed in imagination and expressed by the term “beDim-myon simanim” (analogous significations).58 In his mystical ascent the reader unfolds the divine structure in his return to the roots of the divine names, in unweaving (retexere) the sefirotic texture through the textual structure. Such an entrance into the inner rooms is granted within the initiation into the se-crets of kabbalistic exegesis: The mystic unweaves the text, in order to pen-etrate into the union between name and cognomen, and then he re-weaves it, in order to enter the inner rooms of the world-to-come. Gikatilla replaces the cosmic sympatheia of Neoplatonic theurgy in weaving with a new semiotic tapestry of prayer as described in Sha‘arei ’Orah. The structure of the words is atomized into single letters as he writes on the last page of Sha‘arei ’Orah: ‘As there are many rooms within the rooms and hidden secrets within the secrets in each letter of the letters of the Torah.’It should be remembered that medieval and ancient writers do not distin-guish between what we call verbal and visual, an observation that Mary Car-ruthers demonstrates in detail.59 For Gikatilla, the letters used for writing were considered to be as visual as what we call images today. Organizations of im-ages designed to strike the mind’s eye forcefully are called siman in Sha‘arei 58 On that expression, cf. Menahem Recanati, Perush ‘al haTorah, 37b–c.

We could also regard this manufacture of mnemonic im-agery as a process of mental ornamentation.61In other words, the structure of the sefirotic world is revealed in the struc-ture of the woven text, with a textual marker of siman (symbol). This is a refer-ence to the rabbinic ideology of ritual language,62 in which the shape of the written form has to be preserved in an exact manner because it is part of the significance of the name. Within the process of reading Sha‘arei ’Orah, an inte-grative analogy has been established between name and text, text and sefirotic structure, which allows for the integration of the ontological level of the reader via language. Therefore, the exact context/place of each single word or even letter in the hierarchical structure has to be preserved, as it might have a posi-tive or negative theurgic effect on the sefirotic system.4 Weaving and Prayer in Proclean Theory of SymbolA similar combined structure between the weaving metaphor or signs (sima-nin) and ascending theurgic prayer can be observed in the writings of some Neoplatonists. As a basis for the effective prayer in theurgy, Iamblichus de-scribes signs/synthemata as follows:6360 We should compare this to Greek tradition where all perceptions presented to the mind, are encoded as phantasmata, representations or a kind of eikon. See Carruthers, Book of Memory, 17; cf. “mental imagery” as a concept in modern psychology discussed in Richard-son, Mental Imagery, 4–24.61 Cf. Carruthers, Craft of Thought, 122.

The theurgist does not force the gods to do anything, but acti-vates an inherent mechanism with the help of the signs.According to Proclus, the highest type of theurgy is the one that brings about the mystical union with the One, sometimes described as assimilation to the Father.64 The “One in us” contacts the One of the gods and functions as a theurgical symbolon. We should remember that in Proclus’ writings names are conceived as symbols, especially because of the divine power inherent in them. This power has to be activated for theurgical purposes. Robbert van den Berg has demonstrated that theurgical names do not necessarily have to be secret names, but also names familiar to any reader of the Greek myths.65 Pro-clus shows in his commentary on Cratylus § 7166 that the gods generate the world, so that everything depends on them and bears their symbols, which forces the products to return to their causes. The gods at their highest level are ineffable in their uniformity, but the plurality of their manifestations, i.e., the causative symbols, at the lower level makes them more effable. On our level they are perfectly effable. In his next step Proclus connects the story of the causative symbols with the divine names, which might be compared to Gika-tilla’s linguistic-ontological pyramid in the introduction of Sha‘arei ’Orah. We read in Proclus’ Hymns:67Such are the so-called symbols of the gods: they are uniform in the supe-rior orders, but multiform in the inferior. Imitating these symbols, theur-gy too produces them through uttered, though inarticulate, expressions. The third type of symbols which has come down from the noetic level of being to all things and proceeds all the way to us is the divine names, musical compositions as symbols, see ibid., 170–188; on numbers as theurgical symbol, ibid., 189–215.64 For the references, see van den Berg, Proclus’ Hymns, 78.65 Van den Berg, Proclus’ Hymns, 101–106.66 Cf. § 71, 21–35, esp. 25–26, 28–29, and 31.67 Cf.

They have been revealed by the gods themselves, cause reversion back to them, and, to the extent that there is something luminous in them, lead to hu-man understanding.Proclus categorizes in this paragraph the levels of different types of names. The highest, ineffable symbols68 or names are to be found on the level of the noetic gods and upward. The only appropriate behavior on this level is silence. The first effable names appear at the level below the noetic gods, the noetic-noeric level. Van den Berg assumes that these names are the unarticulated sounds uttered by the theurgist. Therefore, emanation can also be called a move from ineffability to utterance.In contrast to Gikatilla, in this form of theurgy all ritual is left behind on the highest level.69 In Gikatilla, however, the connecting link between the One and the human soul is the Hebrew language as used in ritual, i.e., prayer up to the highest level. For Proclus, it seems that ritual theurgy only works up to the level of the noetic-noeric gods, the level up to which theurgical rituals function.The causes, which are the gods of Proclus’ metaphysical system, are situated at the various levels of reality and even seem to include the One itself. Through symbols we are able to return to the causes of which we bear the symbols. In Proclus’ De Sacrificio it is stressed that symbola derive their efficacy from like-ness (homoiotes) to their cause, i.e., from the gods. That which marks all things as belonging to the same series (chain) is an immaterial symbol of their own monad, i.e., the end of their series.70 In this way, that which is higher is present in that which is lower, because the lower partakes of the higher. The less per-fect are also present in the more perfect, because the latter contain the former as causes. The joining together of beings is based on the philosophical rule that there can be no causality without similarity between cause and effect.71 We might compare this to Gikatilla’s emanative system of names and cognomina, where the highest divine name is also present in the lowest adjective in the biblical text, or even in the single letter. The binding together of the causes and the products by virtue of this likeness is also described in Proclus as an 68 Cf. on theurgical symbols van den Berg, Proclus’ Commentary, 146–147.69 Cf.

Outer symbols might be compared to the outer symbols of ritual, like the donning of the tefillin (phy-lacteries), to invoke the divine power within the words and grant access to the upper world.75In Proclus’ theory of prayer the effectiveness of prayer, or magic in general, depends on the symbols placed in the souls at the time of creation. With the help of these symbols, prayer brings about the persuasion (peito) of the divine, i.e. as opposed to applied force.Proclus explains his ideas on theurgic prayer in In Tim. i 210, 30–211, 8:And prayer contributes enormously to this epistrophe by means of the ineffable symbols to the gods, which the Father of the souls has sown into them. It attracts the benevolence of the gods towards itself and unites those who pray with those to whom they pray. It moves the will of those who perfectly contain all good to bestow it without envy; it persuades the divine and establishes all that we have in the gods.76However, in Neoplatonism every movement of ascent starts with acquiring knowledge, followed by purification. Similar to Gikatilla’s performative sym-bol in Sha‘arei ’Orah, Proclus stresses the idea that the mythical symbols not only attract the gods, but that human beings too have to be purified and dis-posed sympathetically towards the divine, if they are to benefit from the divine beneficence. Proclus also highlights in his Commentary on the Parmenides the 72 Cf. Theol. Plat. iv, 24, 26ff.73 Cf. van den Berg, Proclus’ Hymns, 83.74 In Tim. i 210, 13.75 Cf. his comments in his Sodot, where the secret meaning of this practice (with regard both to the tefillin and the tallit) is envisioned as binding Jews to God – mechanisms permitting them entrance to the sefirot, God’s “wondrous acts”. See Lachter, Kabbalistic Revolution, 148–151. I assume that not only the act of donning the tefillin, but also the pronunciation of the words in prayer activate such mechanisms.76 Van den Berg, Proclus’ Hymns, 87.

The basic structure of the cosmos is reflected in prayer by the basic element of language: sound.The element of the vocal sound in prayer is also crucial for Iamblichus and his theory of theurgic prayer. He speaks of the gods as really involved in the benevolent act in illuminating the theurgists and drawing their souls up to themselves. The ascent is initiated through invocations (De Mysteriis i 12; 41, 16–42, 5).80Sound signifies a hylomorphic element in the weaving metaphor in Sha‘arei ’Orah and Sha‘ar haNiqqud, which designates the actual sound produced by pronouncing the words in prayer, enwrapping the mystic himself and being the garment or channel for the divine influx. In Gikatilla’s hermeneutical approach the mystic can reach this “inner point” (the vocalization point of Ginnat ’Egoz) via his exegetical activities, either on an intellectual level as in Ginnat ’Egoz, or on the ritual level as exemplified in Sha‘arei ’Orah.The various appearances of the word derekh (way) and the interrelation between the different modes of undertaking this journey in prayer show the highly dynamic interplay between utterance of words or names in prayer and their sefirotic counterpart. Prayer as described in the fifth gate might even in-clude pronouncing the divine name and all the names comprised in it, Sha‘arei ’Orah i: 194:After we have made known to you this great issue, you have to under-stand how much you have to concentrate and be careful when you pro-nounce it. Know that at the moment you say it you bear in your mouth all of His holy names as if you were carrying the blessed Name in your 77 Cf. Dillon and Morrow, Proclus’ Commentary, 100.78 Cf. ibid., 143.79 Cf. Gikatilla refers to recitation of the divine name aloud in Sha‘arei ’Orah i: 194–195 in a theurgic rite. Both in Proclus’ and in Gikatilla’s thought the correspondence between the lower and higher realms is established through language.80 Cf. Clarke, Dillon and Hershbell, Iamblichus, 52–53; on Iamblichus’ theory of prayer, see Dillon, Iamblichi Chalcidensisi, 407–411.

I interpret this passage as a description of a prayer spoken aloud, where the sounds may become the vehicles for the words ascending. The uniting of letters and sounds may also mirror a cosmic reunifi-cation as Gikatilla specifies, Sha‘arei ’Orah i: 195.In other words, the weaving of the text in Sha‘arei ’Orah, esp. in its introduc-tion, is part of a shift from the divine names as strong symbols81 to a much more allegorical approach, where siman is used in the lexigraphical form of Sha‘arei ’Orah as a guide through biblical text/ landscape as in monastic medi-tation.82 Such a lexicographic principle might be one of the reasons for the positive reception of Gikatilla in later Christian kabbalah. In the divine names Gikatilla highlights the “keywords of a mystical encyclopedia”, the loci com-munes cabbalistici, according to one of the major representative writings in Christian kabbalah, the Cabala Denudata of Christian Knorr von Rosenroth.835 Origen and the Woven NamesIn his fictional disputation between a Jew and a Christian, Contra Celsum 1: 24, Origen refers to ancient Jewish tradition of ‘woven names’. He refers to it in his discussion on the ‘nature of names’. Origen shows the nature of powerful names in different magic traditions such as that of the ‘Egyptian wise men, the learned men among the Persians (magi),...’ within a consistent system, which has principles known to very few.His formulation has to be put in the context of the efficacy of divine names in theurgic rites, as in the Chaldean Oracles, frag. 150, where the oracle warns the theurgist not to change the onomata barbara, i.e. not to translate the for-eign names of the gods into Greek, for these names possess an ineffable power in the initiation rites. In this magical context, the woven names can be equated with the synthemata/symbola in their theurgic usage.8481 Cf. Eco, Limits of Interpretation, 18.82 Cf. Carruthers, Craft of Thought, 7–24.83 Cf.

Then we would say that the name Sabaoth, and Adonai, and all the other names that have been handed down by the Hebrews with great reverence, are not concerned with ordinary created things, but with a certain mysterious divine science that is related to the Creator of the universe. It is for this reason when these names are pronounced in a wo-ven structure which is natural to them, they can be employed for certain purposes; and so also with other names in use in Egyptian which invoke certain daemons who have power only to do certain particular things; and other names in Persian which invoke other powers, and so on with each nation.85I want to pay attention to the description of the pronunciation of the divine names in a consistent system. In the case of Origen, we have to suppose the existence of ancient Jewish magical traditions, which activate the power in di-vine names86 through actually pronouncing them aloud. The ‘real essence of a name’ is expressed in its vocal sound in magic prayer. In another passage, On Prayer 24: 2,139,87 Origen discusses names and how they point to the deepest meanings of objects, thereby signifying their nature. A name is ‘a summing up denomination which gives the real essence (character) of the named object’. For Origen the nature of names is a profound and obscure question, as well as a ‘certain, mysterious divine science’, a consistent ‘system with principles known to very few’ (Contra Celsum 1: 24 and 25). Here we find a clear indication that an elitist circle was actually using the names in such a manner. For Ori-gen divine names are not completely arbitrary, but words that are operative in ritual transformations. With the sound, this divine essence does become avail-able here below. What is of interest in our examination of Origen in reference to Gikatilla is Origen’s idea that the power of divine names is automatically 85 Cf. Chadwick, Origen: Contra Celsum, 23–24. I follow Chadwick’s translation, changing the important passage on weaving as Chadwick misses the point when translating sunhu-phous as “in a particular sequence”. The French and the German translation render this term correctly. See Bourret, Origène. Contre Celse, 139: “qui les entrelace”; and Koetschau, Origenes. Gegen Kelsos, 45: “in dem mit ihnen fest verknüpften Zusammenhang”. For the Greek text see Koetschau, Die Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahr-hunderte, Band 3, 74–75.86 Cf.

So the sound of the names in Hebrew is closely related to their efficacy in Origen’s passage. This is stressed later on in the same paragraph, where he explains that it need not be the “signification” of the name which gives it power but “the qualities and characteristics of the sounds”.To summarize: Origen emphasizes the ‘woven structure’ within which the divine names are pronounced according to an ancient Jewish tradition in a similar structure like Gikatilla. The magic power inherent in these names is activated by reason of the concept of sympatheia by this performative act of speech, which is indicated by Gikatilla with the word siman/sod in ascending prayer or mystical ascent in Sha‘arei ’Orah.Among modern scholars of semantics, John Lyons89 has shown that all per-formative language has its automatic quality, i.e., conditions under which it is operative. Origen is persuaded that Jews were also careful in uttering divine names, being concerned with their inherent and automatic power. Later on in Contra Celsum 1: 26 Origen refers to the ‘secret doctrines’ known to Moses in the prohibition against mentioning the name of God. In these doctrines we find a reference to them being read aloud, as in his Homilies on Joshua 20: 1, where he writes:Even as magical incantations have a certain natural power, such that he who utters them, even when he is not conscious of their meaning, derives something from the incantation by virtue of the nature of the sounds in the incantation, whether for the harm or the healing of his body or soul; so you must recognize that more powerful than any incantation is the naming of the names in the Holy Scripture. For there are certain powers (dynameis) within us, of which the better are nourished by these, as it were, incantations, since they are by nature akin to them, even if we are not conscious of this; those powers, understanding what is said, become more powerful within us for assisting our lives.... So there are a multitude of powers within us which have been assigned to our souls and bodies, which, if they are whole/holy, when the Holy Scripture is read, are ben-efitted and become stronger, even if ‘our mind is unfruitful’, as it is written about him who speaks with tongues (1 Cor. 14: 14): ‘My spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful’.9088 Cf. the last passage of Sha‘ar haNiqqud and the inherent, natural power within the letters compared to medical plants.

Lyons, Semantics i, 5–10.90 Cf. for the translation Dillon, ‘Magical Power of Names’, 214–215."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"43Visual and Acoustic Symbols<UN>Origen is drawing here on the notion of sympatheia to explain the physical effect of powerful names on us. The resonance of these powers is indepen-dent of our purpose or state of mind when uttered; they have a natural power independent of meaning. John Dillon91 has noted how Origen is referring here to Plotinus (Enn. iv, 4, 30–45) and designates naming as the reason for the ef-fect of magical incantations arising from the cosmic principle of sympatheia. The incantations function effectively by reason of sympatheia, ‘the concord of things alike and the mutual repulsion of unlike ones, and in general the variety of the many potencies all combining to make a single living being’.For Origen, Hebrew is the original language and the recitation of names is effective only if the words, i.e., the names, are uttered in Hebrew. Otherwise they will be ‘weak and ineffective’ (Contra Celsum 1: 25). The sound of names in Hebrew is closely related to their efficacy. This is stressed later on in the same paragraph, where he explains that it need not be the ‘signification’ of the name which gives it power but ‘the qualities and characteristics of the sounds’. He bases his knowledge on ‘Hebrew name interpreters’92 and states in his Selec-tions on Psalms 2 (Selecta in Psalmos) that there are ten names for God and again attributes the interpretation of these and other names to the ‘Hebrews’. I see in Origen’s key-parable93 a reference to the Hebrew language itself, not only to the divine names, as the key to opening the text, to the proper under-standing of its meaning. The hermeneutical exercise was performed, not only to find out the original correspondence monosemically, but to do this in the original language (Hebrew) based on a Neoplatonic conception of correspon-dence between word and divine entity.Origen attributes the automatic efficacy/power of divine names in ritual to their Hebrew origin as their ‘natural manifestation’, i.e., their sound. He enu-merates ten names for the divine and refers to Hebrew “name interpreters” as source for his knowledge. The most effective name is according to the Jewish tradition the Tetragrammaton, which becomes the center of the ritual system, especially in the Hekhalot literature. However, angelic names are also a means for achieving ascent through the heavens; even in a nonsensical form, they have signification and the sounds signify the name. The signification of name and sound are both dependent on Hebrew, especially in their imitation of 91 Ibid.92 Cf. de Lange, Origen and the Jews, 118. De Lange refers Origen’s interpretes nominum to the Hebrew Doresh Shemot in Ruth Rabba 2: 5 and Gen. Rabba 42: 5, where the term is attrib-uted to R. Meir and R. Yoshua ben Qorlah.93 Cf.

According to ancient Jewish traditions as found in the Hekhalot literature, the performative force of speech is located in the divine name and its derivatives and can be activated in ritual.As we demonstrated Origen emphasizes the ‘woven structure’ within which the divine names are pronounced according to an ancient Jewish tradition. The magic power inherent in these names is activated by reason of the concept of sympatheia by this performative act of speech. ConclusionI have tried to show the similarities between certain structures in the percep-tion of the symbol as both visual and acoustic device in Gikatilla, Neoplatonic and Pythagorean traditions. According to the passages cited from Origen, the Church fathers also seem to have known of an ancient tradition referring to such structures within the Hebrew literary heritage. Those similarities might explain the smooth absorption of kabbalistic hermeneutics within the Chris-tian kabbalah and Western philosophy after the Middle Ages in general. Such explanations will make it easier for scholarship to account for the affinities be-tween hermeneutical systems of the medieval kabbalists and modern theories of language.BibliographyAbulafia, A., ’Imrei Shefer, Ms Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek 40; Ms Paris, BN 777, printed by A.

AllenOne of the defining moments for a Christian Platonist is the scriptural account in Exodus of Moses’ ascent of Sinai and of his being in the presence of God Himself for forty days and nights. By the same token a Platonic interpretation of this event is fraught with various possibilities, some of them heretical. For Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), for example, Moses’ experience of God on Mt. Si-nai is the model of all Platonic ascents to a One beyond being, where the im-ages of a triple summit and of an arduous climb up into dense cloud-cover and thence into an electric thunder storm raging above it, serve as the governing metaphors. Predictably Christians have interpreted this Sinai event in the light of that other mountain event, the transfiguration (metamorphôsis) of Christ on Mt. Tabor in the synoptic gospels, when Moses and Elijah appeared with him, and God’s voice spoke from out of a cloud declaring, in a repetition of the proclamation at Christ’s baptism in the river Jordan, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased; Hear ye him.”1 It was witnessed by Peter, James and John (though not described oddly in John’s Gospel); and from the beginning, the link between this New Testament event and the experience on Mt. Sinai was explicit. Moses’ face when he descended from Sinai shone in a manner that Christian typologists inevitably saw as prefiguring the transfigurative mo-ment when the Lord’s face and the faces of Moses and Elijah “did shine as the sun” and their raiment was ablaze and “as white as the light.”2 The shining Mo-ses of Exodus, who prefigured the shining Christ of the Transfiguration, be-came for Ficino the paradigm not only of the Platonic philosopher and magus, but of the enlightened pre-Christian and then Christian soul in an enlightened body—the paradigm, that is, of the ascendant man as light itself. For what is a man indeed, writes Ficino in a letter to the human race, but an earthly star 1 See Mark 9:2–8, Matthew 17:1–8, Luke 9:28–36; cf. 2 Peter 1:16–18.

Most importantly, a dramatic encounter with light, and with it of miraculous transfiguration, had been described centuries prior to Moses, or so Ficino be-lieved, by the Chaldaean Magi, the sources of whose spirituality and theology preceded Abraham himself.To be filled to overflowing with light was the goal of the magic taught the Chaldaeans by their founder, Zoroaster, the first magus and their “prince,”4 and, more significantly still, the putative author of the wisdom embodied in the ancient Chaldaean Oracles.5 We now know the collection circulating in the Renaissance under that title was in fact a compilation from later antiquity; yet Ficino and the vast majority of his contemporaries considered the Oracles genuine. Moreover, they liked to think of them as the earliest texts of the an-cient theology—and not just as the earliest surviving texts—in that they were the oracular wisdom of the very first of the ancient theologians. This seminal Zoroastrian wisdom eventually culminated first in the works of Plato and then superlatively in the teachings of Christ. For Christ was the perfection of the Magi, the supreme magus, in that as a child-king in a manger, he had been wor-shipped not only by simple shepherds, but by the three star-led philosopher kings from the East. They had journeyed to acknowledge him as the new Zoro-aster, and to give him the precious gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh to signify his kingliness, his priestliness, and his passion.3 It is now in the first book of Ficino’s Letters as No. 110, ed. Sebastiano Gentile (Florence: Olschki, 1990), 194.4 In his Opera, p. 844.2, Ficino defines magic as “the Zoroastrian art.” See my Synoptic Art, 35–41.5 For the status and history of the Chaldaean Oracles for Ficino and his contemporaries, see Dannenfeldt, ‘The Pseudo-Zoroastrian Oracles in the Renaissance’; idem, ‘Hermetica Philo-sophica’ and ‘Oracula Chaldaica’; and Tambrun, ‘Marsile Ficin et le Commentaire de Pléthon sur les Oracles chaldaïques’."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Allen52<UN>Now the Magi, so Ficino argues in his Platonic Theology 13.4.15,6 had pro-claimed that the soul’s supreme miracle is the consequence of its ability to surround its own body with light assembled from circumambient rays, and to lift its body on high with the levity intrinsic to such rays, a feat that was at-tributed to Zoroaster himself.7 He had learned to do this by way of ascetically practising a range of “emptyings” and notably the fifth emptying that came with twenty years of meditation in solitude in the wilderness. This “emptying” or vacatory discipline had enabled him both to intuit what the divinities pre-siding over the stars and planets were contemplating enacting on earth;8 and, by way of reaction, to create an alphabetical, or rather hieroglyphical, system that used astrological-astronomical signs as the basis of writing.9 In this way Zoroaster had brought the fiery stars down to earth as a symbolic system to guide us, and to cast their light upon our darkness. This is significant given that one of the oracles declares, “You must ascend to the light itself, to the rays of the father, the source from which soul—enveloped in the ample light of mind—has flowed into you.”10Ficino speculates that the miracle of levitation, of authentic Zoroastrian levitation, and not the levitation of conjurors with their clever placement of mirrors, was made possible because of the nature of light itself. For “the first light is in God and it is such that it surpasses the intellect, and thus cannot even be called the intelligible light.”11 However, this divine light, whenever it is poured forth into an angel, becomes at once an intellectual light and can be understood as such intuitively, angelically. When it is poured into the soul it becomes a rational light: though it can still be understood intuitively, it can in addition be thought about discursively. Thence it passes down to the soul’s idolum, which is the “soul’s foot” or reason’s image and which inheres in the aethereal vehicle as its life, containing as it does the phantasy, sense, and vital force.12 Here in the idolum the light becomes sensitive but not yet corporeal. 6 Ed. and tr. by James Hankins and myself, 6 vols.

In this elemental body it becomes at last visible. This descending light is equated with the six link golden chain in Homer’s Iliad 8.15–28 that stretches from heaven to earth; and Ficino rejoices that the select few who have seized hold of this golden chain can lift themselves up to the very heavens, lift themselves up, that is, by way of light into the realm of light.14Since “celestial souls abound with so much light from heaven,” moreover, the overflowing plenty of that light “spills over into their bodies” as is the case, obviously with the stars. And this is true too of souls. Whenever a human soul focuses its gaze upon God and is filled and possessed by the divine light to the point that it becomes similarly resplendent, then that soul “pours its co-pious rays out into its aethereal vehicle; and thence, via that vehicle and via its airy body, out into the ordinary visible body.” Filled to the brim with light, this ordinary visible body is at last “set ablaze, rarefied, lifted up,” transferred into, transformed into the aethereal body, “like tow wafted up through the flame.”15 In such a fiery chariot, Ficino asserts, both Elijah and St. Paul were swept up into the very vault of heaven.16 Eventually, at the Last Judgment, ev-ery resurrected body that Christian theologians have traditionally thought of as the “glorified body” will be similarly lifted up, enraptured and enflamed, in a universal mass levitation subject to light itself and subject specifically for Christians to the light of and in Christ, to the light that invests the Redeemer’s own glorified body.17In two remarkable passages in his commentary on the Areopagite’s De divinis nominibus 29.4–6.18 Ficino takes up the topic of visions that come with light:13 See Toussaint, ‘Sensus naturae: Jean Pic, Le véhicule de l’âme et l’équivoque de la magie naturelle’ and Corrias, ‘Imagination and Memory in Marsilio Ficino’s Theory of the Ve-hicles of the Soul’, with further refs.14 Platonic Theology 13.4.15.15 Ibid. 13.4.16.

Or should we say rather that the intelligible light from these visions, pouring itself more abundantly into our intellect, overflows straightway from our intellect into our imagination; and that clothed in various shapes and now made imaginable, it flows inwardly into the sight too? And doesn’t the light ap-pear more effectively here and seem more true than if it had fallen upon the sight externally by way of some more lowly means?This is the reason, so the Platonists suppose, why the majority of di-vine visions become visible. The words of Dionysius seem to speak to the same notion, when he talks about people to whom these visions appear and who are then illuminated. He calls them prophets and teachers of things sacred.Platonic reason perchance has argued that the visions brought about by way of God on high and through the sublime angels all occur for this second reason [i.e. inwardly], but the visions effected through the lower angels occur more often for the first reason [i.e. through the condensing of air], especially when they are presented to men who are not totally pure. To conclude, however, we will espouse whatever view an assembly of theologians would most approve.19Earlier in the commentary at 17.10 ff., however, he had dramatically envisaged the Resurrection as the time when, like the Sun in Spring awakening the seeds in the bosom of the earth, “Christ’s most splendid body, at the appointed time, will awaken everywhere the bodies of human beings with its far-flung rays, and adorn many of them, besides, with splendours,” As children of the Res-urrection (Luke 20:36) we will through our [physical] sight “enjoy the visible light of Christ’s body,” and through our intellect “enjoy the intelligible light 19 A not dissimilar problem occurs with how to interpret the miracle of Christ’s walking on the water which Ficino discusses in his Commentary on the De divinis nominibus 57.4–5 (ed. cit. 1:233): “when Christ passed over the surface of the water with dry feet, did he take on the water’s power of buoying him up so that His feet were not immersed? Or did He Himself in the meantime perhaps lift the weight from His feet? Or rather did He take the animal power [i.e. the irrational soul power] which ruled over His [other] members and multiply this power in His feet? Or finally shall we say that He inhaled as much air as pos-sible by breathing deeply; and by the lightness of the air that His body was buoyed up and that He flew over the water?

And ultimately, through our unity, our mind’s head or flower (Phaedrus 247C8, 248A3), we will enter into union with Him as lesser rays absorbed into His greater rays.In this emphasis on Christ’s own spiritual body and its redemptive, seminal power to quicken a new Spring, Ficino is haunted by other lines in the Chaldae-an Oracles in which Zoroaster declares: “Since the soul becomes a resplendent fire through the power of the Father, may the soul’s immortal profundity domi-nate you and raise all eyes as one on high; for then you will not abandon even the material body to the precipice.”21 In the phrase “becomes a resplendent fire,” Ficino takes Zoroaster to be referring to the soul’s conversion “through the power of the Father back to the Father,” to its overflowing with the divine light that overflows from God Himself.22 Since God is absolute unity above mind, is “the centre of essences above essence,” the soul is united to Him, Platonically speaking, not through its mind but through its unity; and this must itself be intense light, and be a source of such light, be the sun blazing within ourselves with the splendor of the absolute good.In Oracle 112 when Zoroaster exhorts us, “Let the soul’s immortal profundity be your leader (or rule over you),” he means by the “profundity” this very unity: it is the illumined and luminous faculty that unites us with God, even as God has impressed it on our souls from the very beginning as the seal or mark of His own unity divine. Upon it all the other powers of the soul serially depend, as if they were rays depending on the sun; and to it they return, as the radii of a cir-cle proceed from and revert to the circle’s centre. In exhorting us to lift up “all eyes as one on high,” Zoroaster is telling us that all the soul’s powers, with their different levels of knowing, have to be first gathered together into mind and then brought into the illumined unity above mind as the centre of its circle. Thus the unity is in effect the blazon of light in us. Strikingly, Ficino sees the twenty-fourth psalm as trumpeting the same exhortation: “Lift up your gates, o ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors.”2320 1:137 (ed. cit.).21 Platonic Theology 13.4.16 assembles the four lines of this dictum from three fragments: from 96 (the first line), 112 (both lines), and 158 (the one line) (ed. Des Places).22 Cf. Platonic Theology 13.5.1 (last line): “for the soul is divine light (lumen).” The Oracles he sees perforce as speaking of the Father and not of the Son but nonetheless of the Father as emanating power.23 Psalm 24:7 and 9 (the Roman psalter)."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Allen56<UN>Finally, when Zoroaster asserts that the “material body”—meaning the soul’s vehicle in any one of its four “elemental” states as primarily fiery, airy, watery, or earthy24—“is not to be abandoned to the precipice” at the time of death, Ficino takes him to be affirming the doctrine of the resurrection of the body. For the body too will be raised along with the soul and not abandoned in the lowest place of the world, the place that the Magi call the “precipice.”25 Ficino adds that Mercurius Trismegistus also describes the power and effect of this resurrection-levitation miracle when he discusses regeneration with his son Tat in one of the most important treatises on this theme in the Corpus Hermeticum, the tenth treatise.26This constellation of ideas and images, with their pre-Platonic Chaldaean and Hermetic sources, is tantamount to laying the foundations of a radical, if not exactly a radically new, Platonic magic theory that will only be perfected at last in Christ. In the interim the magus will cross over from one level of forms to another, light leaping forth and then reflecting back upon itself being the ultimate form-changing magic, a magic much more important for Ficino, I would argue, than the love magic he pursued in his De Amore, which it ef-fectively replaces, though, predictably, there are some fascinating cross-overs.The crux of the situation, however, is that the Magi and then Christ per-form this lumenological or rather photological magic not so much on external things as eventually on themselves, on their own mind, and on perhaps the minds of those attending Christ insofar as they are of one mind with Him, or one in mind, or simply, in the manner of Averroes, one mind. The possibility of this light magic working both on and in external matter is secondary, and strictly speaking irrelevant, since the goal of this magic, as a kind of Platonic gnosis or epistemology, is internal illumination or enlightenment in the literal sense of intensifying the light within, not, or not in the first place, an external diffusion or splendor, however blinding. Moses was ablaze within in Exodus 34:29–35, however much he may have shone without to those who saw him descending from Sinai with “the two tables of testimony.”This magic is very much keyed, furthermore, to the notion of a fountain of sparkling or scintillating light and not just to the quietistic (or even hesychas-tic) notion of a steady, glowing or phosphorescent light.27 Authentic light 24 “Primarily” because Ficino subscribes to the theory that every element is in another but in an altered or diminished way: thus air is in earth but in an earthy manner. See his Epi-nomis epitome (Opera, 1527 ff.).25 Platonic Theology 13.4.16.26 Corpus Hermeticum (Pimander) 10.13; 10.16–18; 10.21.27 Platonic Theology 11.6.9–10."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"57Transfiguration and the Fire Within<UN>magic is the magic within us, within ourselves as magi, within the fountains of our minds. And this is more particularly so, since here on earth we are lost in the shadows of the sensible world, in the world of dreams and of ourselves as dreamers, and since all sensible knowledge is inherently derivative, partial and hence deceitful, an unlit and unilluminated sorcery. True horses and men, for a Platonist, are not found in matter, which preserves only their images or shad-ows.28 Insofar as a sorcerer indeed is concerned with casting spells in the mate-rial world, or with casting the evil eye, he is therefore involved in a night magic, or a shadowy dream magic, in a deceitful nocturnal art that is utterly inferior to the luminous concerns of true magic.29 Or at best it merely echoes or imitates them in inferior ways. Insofar as our familiar ordinary world is the Platonic cave with its intricate dance of ephemeral shadows on the wall, we are con-stantly subject to this nocturnal, fantastic, phenomena-based, sorcery-magic. But if we persevere as philosophers we may hope to (re-)acquire the magic of inner purification that will enable us to climb out of the cavern of mortality into the splendor of intellection. Thence we will return to the incandescent light of God, who, in the memorable phrase of St. James’ epistle, is “the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning” (1:17).Ficino was demonstrably haunted by the image of the ascent in a fiery chariot—not only the one that had carried Elisha and Paul to the third heaven and the chariot of Ezekiel’s memorable vision, but even more perhaps by the winged chariot in the great mythical hymn of Plato’s Phaedrus which was and is of our own spiritual making and which constitutes the highest achievement of any art, human, daemonic, or angelic.30 While Giovanni Pico della Miran-dola (1463–1494) was to suggest in his 900 theses that the highest magical act is in the twin transubstantiations of the Mass, Ficino seems to have rediscov-ered something more Platonic, less controversial perhaps than the notion of a Christian sacramental magic, but laden with a number of occult and theo-logical associations with light and with the first utterance of the Divinity as Creator: fiat lux. He has rediscovered, that is, the magical Zoroastrian moment of levitation, the moment of mortal self-fabrication, self-intensification, and elevatory meditation alike. But it is a moment dependent on the intensifica-tion and magnification of light in the soul or the soul-mind, and dependent on the possibility, indeed the necessity ultimately, of our own luminous trans-figuration. In sum, to enable our souls to brim over with light is the supreme 28 Ibid. 11.6.8.29 Ibid., 13.4.8.30 See the introduction to my Marsilio Ficino: Commentaries on Plato: Volume i: Phaedrus and Ion, x–xi."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Allen58<UN>miracle, the supreme magical and visionary accomplishment upon which all lesser magics depend.*What then is the relationship between light and life? The Platonic Theology 18.9.15 says, “it is God’s measureless power that is the efficient cause of the resurrection and eternal life.” For it is most appropriate that “the infinity of life that raises the dead” be the same infinity that preserves the dead liberated from death for all eternity. “The only proper counterpart to such a stupendous miracle as restoring to life is the bestowal of everlasting life in the future.” For this miracle, God in His omnipotence makes bodies submit to the sway of their souls “to such a degree that the everlasting life of the soul flows over everlast-ingly into the body too” as a kind of light. This situation calls for the imposition of the most outstanding form possible (as against the matter subjected to it), though it is wholly in keeping with the order of actual nature.31 So the intel-lect is filled to overflowing with divine life as living light, and the will is replete with gladness. Together, “with incomparable power, they pour their wonderful splendor and capacity for motion entirely into the body.” The consequence is that, just as souls are elevated to the clarity and power of celestial minds, so are bodies elevated to the clarity and power of celestial bodies. “Nor should it seem surprising,” he says, that the human body, “which by nature and on account of its temperance is not dissimilar to the heavens, when it is clothed again in a kind of celestial form as a gift, is suddenly raised on high to the celestial region, having as its leader the soul borne up by the infinite power of God.” Even now on earth and disjoined from God, the soul unites, sustains, and lifts the body contrary to the nature of its lower elements. So it is not surprising that later, “conjoined with God above the heavens, the soul is able to raise the body with itself to the sublime region of the aether,” as the author in effect of its own body’s resurrection.32This whole series of dovetailed arguments in 18.9.15 is remarkable on at least three counts. Firstly, it establishes levitation by way of concentrated and abun-dant light as a foretaste of, and as a witness to, the final resurrection of the soul in the aethereal body on the Day of Judgment, however unorthodox this view of the Resurrection may have been at the time in the Latin West. For on that day all the souls of the redeemed will levitate in a universal overflowing of light 31 Cf. Aquinas, Summa contra Gentiles 4.85.5.32 For two very different perspectives on the notion of bodily resurrection, see see Bynum, The Resurrection of the Body in Western Christianity, 200–1336 and Vidal, ‘Brains, Bodies, Selves, and Science: Anthropologies of Identity and the Resurrection of the Body’."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"59Transfiguration and the Fire Within<UN>divine, and they will become again like shooting stars or blazing tow wafted upwards by the divine wind.Secondly, quite apart from the implications for light metaphysics, this levi-tatory vision also has the effect of valorising levitas as the ultimate physical and at the same time mystical force, the lightness of light so punningly apropos in English. This is noteworthy given the fact that it is the countervailing force of gravity that will come to dominate the scientific world view for the ensuing four centuries before and after its apotheosis in Newton.33And thirdly, Ficino sees Zoroaster, the most ancient of the ancient theolo-gians, as not only prophesying the final resurrection of body and soul in an intense blaze of light as we understand it in a Christian context, but as himself bearing witness to it experientially as the prime levitator, the worker of a sub-lime miracle in the pre-Abrahamic, and therefore pre-Mosaic past. This has a direct bearing on our understanding of the value Renaissance Platonists ac-corded the Chaldaean Oracles from which we have just quoted. and which for them preceded not only Christianity but the Pentateuch itself as pre-Judaic, in-deed as the earliest of all sacred texts. In particular we can watch Ficino inter-preting the collection of oracles as a whole sub specie levitatis, that is, in terms of the supreme religious and psychological experience of levitation by way of incandescent light. This transfigurative moment is for him the innermost mys-tery of the oracles, their mystery of mysteries.34 It points in fact to the notion that the sublimest of Christian, of Judaic, of pre-Judaic moments may not be just ecstasy in general, but rather ecstasy in the specific form of levitation, or at least levitation of and in the glorified body. Having been hitherto imprisoned in our lower corporeal selves, this luminous body can at last be manumitted by prayer, by the descent of the radiant light of grace, and by the gathering together of the circumambient rays which are Christ’s body, the sacramental body of the Mass at the end of time.*At this point, it behooves us to look at just one more visionary passage in the Platonic Theology.

Ficino’s Platonic Theology 18.8.11 which speaks of the souls of the blessed as having a habit that is like “a natural levity” that bears them upwards towards the angels, whereas a “natural heaviness” casts the souls of the reprobate down among the demons. To the delight of such demons, surely, we now admire gravitas and disparage levitas.34 In turn, there are obvious and arresting implications for our understanding, in the many Quattrocento depictions of the Epiphany, of the gift-bearing Magi kneeling before a radi-ant babe."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Allen60<UN>leads us, not from corporeal love to the idea of love, but from ordinary visible light to the idea of divine light and to the absolute source of that light, which Christians have traditionally linked to the Biblical notion of the “glory” with which God appears on occasions to men. In the Hebrew Bible the glory of the Lord Himself appears to Moses on Mt. Sinai in a cloud, like a devouring fire,35 as He does in the visions of Ezekiel and Isaiah;36 and so on. In the New Testa-ment it is Christ himself who is or who will be invested in glory, as a range of verses testify; and one might turn to such Pauline texts as 2 Corinthians 4:4’s reference to “the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,” or to Hebrews 2:7 and 2:9’s references to Christ being crowned with glory.However, it is the Gospel of John which develops the idea of Christ’s glory most fully: we have only to recall the phrasing at the end of the logos opening of St. John’s Gospel, “and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (1.14).”37 It is a glory, furthermore, in which we ourselves as the children of light may hope to participate, as John declares in 17:22 and Paul in Romans 5:2; and as we have already seen in the case of the glorified body of the Resurrection. For at the Second Coming, in the reitera-tions of Matthew 25:31, “the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him,” and “he shall sit upon the throne of his glory;”’ and the saved will partake of his glory in that it will bestow light and life upon them in ever-lasting radiance.Yet how do we set about preparing to participate in this luminous “glory”? What is the correct meditative or contemplative disciplina?In seeking God, Ficino tells “the little soul” (animula), we must “take a light which is brighter than the sun’s light to the degree that the sun’s light is bright-er than the earthly shadows” (Platonic Theology 9.3.3). For if we compare it to the sun’s light, the latter, even if it is a thousand thousand times clearer, appears as just a shadow. Then we must take a light “which is so much more re-fined that it eludes the eye’s gaze,” but not extend it through some sort of space or emptiness, lest it be compounded from parts and so need the props of parts and of space. Rather, we must gather all the light into a point, “so that from this infinite union it can become infinitely powerful.” Ficino imagines this point of light as omnipresent, not scattered in space, as “wholly present in any point in space.” It is no longer dyed with the endless variety of colors, pure light being 35 Exodus 16:10, 24:16–17; cf. Numbers 16:19, 42. It is also associated with the Temple and Tabernacle; see Exodus 40:34, Numbers 20:6, Psalms 24:7–10, 78:60–61.36 Ezekiel 10:4, 28:22, 43:2–5; cf. Isaiah 4:5, 60:1–2, 66:5.

At this juncture we arrive, he rhapsodizes, “at a refulgence no space contains,” that is, at a light that transcends ordinary sense-based perception and everything that derives from the senses and is, instead, the light of and beyond the intellect.In 9.3.4 Ficino turns to the requisite stages in the disciplina of enlighten-ment in the literal as well as the figurative sense: “Do you want to gaze upon the face of God again?” If so, you must look at the universal world filled with the light of the sun, a light that dwells in the world’s matter and is forever changing even as it is overflowing with all of the universal forms. If you can indeed sub-tract matter from this light, then suddenly you will have soul itself, incorporeal light that is, replete with all the forms, yet still changing and changeable. If you then subtract change from this soul-light, you will arrive at angelic intellect, at an incorporeal light which, though filled with all the forms, is now unchang-ing. If you subtract from this in turn the difference by means of which each form is different from the light and introduced into the light from elsewhere, then you will reach the essence of the light as identified now with its unchang-ing forms. For at this point the light is forming itself; and through its forms it informs all. The light shines out infinitely, since it is naturally radiant, and it is neither diminished nor confined by the admixture of anything else: “it dwells in no one thing in order that it may blaze in its fullness through all things”; it lives from itself even as it gives life to all, since its shadow, in the comparative formulation, is like the sun’s light; for it alone gives rise to life in bodies. This light senses all and gives sense to all, because its life awakens the senses in all things. Finally, it “loves particular things as if they were preeminently its own.” Accordingly, Ficino asks rhetorically: “What is the sun’s light? And he replies: God’s shadow. So what is God? God is the Sun of the sun.” Hence the sun’s light, the shadow of God, that is, is God in the body of the world, while God Himself is the divine Sun immeasurably beyond the angelic intellects.38This powerful, hymn-like passage, which Ficino had used in his Dialogus inter Deum et animam theologicus,39 may be questionably orthodox, but it is certainly profoundly Platonic both in its meditative progression up from the cavernous world of shadows into the serene world of light, and in its commit-ment to substracting what is extraneous until it arrives at the notion of pure and absolute light as perhaps the ultimate Platonic Idea. This substracting 38 Dei faciem rursus intueri...oblectaberis infinite: repeated, with variations, in Ficino’s Dialo-gus inter Deum et animam theologicus (Opera, 610–611).39 This was sent as a letter to Mercati and is now in book one of Ficino’s Letters 1.4.80–103 (ed.

It occurs in the spirit’s vacatio from the body; in the moments when a prophet or seer can set aside all that is not light. Most importantly, for the righteous soul it occurs at the approach of death itself. Preceded “often” by the sudden ability to prophesy, it comes in the climactic act of self-motion, in the final departing moment of conversion, of self-turning. Interestingly, however, it is no longer the compelling figure of the charioteer, which defines the notion here in 9.9.4 of our escape from mortal limitations. Rather, it is the image of the soul as a spark of light liberated from the flint of matter and returning whence it came, which defines for Ficino the very nature and origin of our spirituality as being both the inner light and the lightness of being—of our being and of all being.Perhaps, we should recall at this juncture the ancient myth of Prometheus, the Titan who stole the heavenly fire and gave it freely to man. I have examined Ficino’s several attempts to interpret this fire myth elsewhere,40 but suffice it to say that Ficino essentially ignores the Aeschylian dimensions of the story, with its suffering hero, and identifies the Titan rather with the providential aspect of Jupiter as the outpouring of jovian light. The Titan’s subsequent tor-ture becomes the torture of thought and it will continue until the time comes at last when Prometheus “is carried back to that same place whence he first received the fire.” This clearly implies some notion of an appointed span, the end of a temporal, perhaps even an astrological cycle, and a “return” to a time when he can regain his status as the most perfect of all the pre-Olympian gods. For at that moment of conversion to his final cause, Prometheus’s whole being will be flooded with the light of celestial understanding which is properly his. Ficino in effect takes the familiar story of a titan’s rebellion and fundamen-tally reshapes it into a creation-resurrection myth keyed to the return of the intellect, along with all the other faculties together, to their original condition as powers suffused with celestial light. Prometheus, in sum, is the jovian fire within, turning and returning to its source.*Let me hazard some conclusions. I would argue that the whole notion of Platonic dying, along with the notion, for a Christian Platonist, of the death-bed conversion, must have been primarily configured for Ficino by two con-siderations: first by the physical and psychological notions in Neoplatonism of reflection, conversion, and eventually of levitation; and second by a light metaphysics which he derived from both Chaldaean and Biblical notions, and 40 In Synoptic Art, 157–159; and ‘Prometheus among the Florentines: Marsilio Ficino on the Myth of Triadic Power’."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"63Transfiguration and the Fire Within<UN>probably from Greek Orthodox41 and Augustinian ones too. These postulate an intense and sacred light, a “glory” that surrounds us and in which we our-selves are glorified, occasionally in this temporal life in a moment of transfigu-ration, but ultimately in our ascension from bodily death into life eternal. As philosopher-believers each one of us looks to the twin paradigms of Christ’s Transfiguration and Ascension; and the ascent to such a glory is not only for the soul, but also as we have seen in the Chaldaean Oracles, for its aethereal body—this newly glorified body being both spherical and star-like and not the angular body we inhabit in the present life, however divinely proportioned, however Vitruvian in its squaring of the circle. This of course has serious impli-cations for an understanding of the key anthropomorphic notion in Genesis 1: 26–27 that we are made in God’s image and likeness, and particularly if we are tempted to reverse the equation and speculate whether God or specifically the Risen Christ is the angular paradigm of man, or is more properly, from an Ori-genist viewpoint, the spherical paradigm, since ultimately we are all destined to be divine spheres ablaze like the blazing stars.It is these two Christian Mysteries, therefore, the Transfiguration and the Ascension, which, I would argue, obsessed Ficino as himself an ardent inter-preter of pagan mysteries of ascent and transfiguration. He must have thought of them, at least in part, in terms of the roles of light, of stellar sphericity, and of levitation in his ancient Platonic and pre-Platonic texts. For the re-ascent and fiery levitation of the light-filled soul—ablaze in Moses’ and in Elijah’s incandescent “glory,” in the blinding whiteness of the transfigured, glorified Christ, would have been wonderfully synonymous for him, or virtually so, not only with the philosopher’s Plotinian alienatio, the flight of the alone to the alone, and with the ancient Chaldaean injunction that we must ascend from the dreadful precipice upwards into light itself, but with the haunting sugges-tion that the mountain of Sinai is figuratively a peak within each one of us, where in the heights of contemplation—and not only on the Last Day—we bear witness to the divine Glory that is eternally within us and above us.BibliographyAllen, Michael J.B., Synoptic Art: Marsilio Ficino on the History of Platonic Interpreta-tion, Istituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento: Studi e Testi XL, Florence: Olschki 1998.41 Ficino’s debt to Orthodox theology on this matter is a topic awaiting investigation; but see G.

The way the human mind functions, in particular its capacity to pro-duce images, ceases to appear, as in medieval thought, a sign of its weakness, becoming rather a proof of its creative capacity and divine nature. To the man who knows how to attune himself to the profound structure of the cosmos, un-limited possibilities are opened. He may attain universal knowledge and thus make himself similar to God, since to know, to remember and to act on things are simply three different sides of an identical process.The most typical exponent of the new phase of the art of memory in the sixteenth century is Giulio Camillo (ca. 1480–1544).2 As one of the most famous men of his time, he was by many celebrated as a divinity, by others viewed with suspicion as a mere charlatan. He travelled far and wide through Italy and France in search of patrons who might be willing to finance the Faustian dream of his life – the realization of a universal memory theatre in which one might store, and re-activate at will, all the knowledge contained in a universal mind.Camillo’s theatre incarnated the dreams that characterized the literary and artistic explorations of his time, and precisely for this reason he attracted the attention of poets, painters and architects. He was included by Ariosto in the select company of princes, noble ladies and men of letters gathered together in the last canto of Orlando Furioso (to the exclusion of Machiavelli, who bitterly 1 On the art of memory in the Renaissance, cf. Rossi, Clavis universalis; Yates, The Art of Memo-ry; Bolzoni, The Gallery of Memory.2 On Giulio Camillo, and for further bibliographic references, see Bolzoni, ‘Giulio Camillo’s Memory Theatre and the Kabbalah’."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"67The Memory Theatre of Giulio Camillo<UN>complained of the slight).3 Camillo was a friend of writers such as Pietro Bem-bo, and had close links with the circle of Pietro Aretino. Also intriguing are the ties that he cultivated with various artists of the period, from the architect Sebastiano Serlio to painters such as Lorenzo Lotto, Pordenone, Francesco Sal-viati, and above all Titian, who not only executed a (now lost) portrait of the philosopher but also painted many images for his memory theatre.Camillo began his career as a master of rhetoric. He shared the classicist ideals of his friend Pietro Bembo, who believed that in order to write well one must imitate the great authors – Cicero and Virgil when writing in Latin, Pe-trarch and Boccaccio when writing in Italian. According to Camillo, the imita-tion of great literary models was an attempt to capture the idea of eloquence that was present, even if in a partial form, in the works of the greatest masters. Thus, rhetoric would be transformed into a metaphysical art which might teach the reader how to ascend from the particular to the universal and conversely how to descend from the universal to the individual. Whoever mastered this art of rhetoric would be capable of manipulating words and rhetorical artifices at will and subjecting them to an infinite variety of transformations. Camillo included rhetoric among the three arts of metamorphosis, together with al-chemy (the art of transforming physical objects) and deification (the art of transforming the human mind into a divine one). We shall be returning to this further on.In order to imitate his literary models and create a system of variations on them, Camillo applied a series of procedures based on two principles: the first was the use of topical places, a traditional component of both rhetoric and logic; the second was Ramon Lull’s clavis universalis. In his analysis of a literary model, Camillo endeavoured to identify the device or artifice used and break it down into its separate parts, each of which might lead the user back to an orig-inal universal category (to the locus, or topical place). At this point he would have before him all the possible combinations of arguments and artifices that might be re-employed for a potential new text.Thus, literary procedures also had a metaphysical dimension, and both were closely intertwined with the techniques of rhetoric.Similarly to his friend Pietro Bembo, as mentioned above, Camillo was con-vinced that there existed a single path leading to the creation of beauty, and 3 ‘E quei che per guidarci ai rivi ascrei \\ mostra piano e più breve altro camino, \\ Iulio Camillo’ (Ludovico Ariosto, Orlando Furioso, 46,12, 5–7) Letter from Niccolò Machiavelli to Lodovico Alamanni with the date of December 17, 1517, in Machiavelli, Tutte le opere, 948. Camillo’s eulogy was added by Ariosto in the edition of 1532; Machiavelli expressed his indignation, in his letter, that he was not included in the edition of 1516."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Bolzoni68<UN>that in order to write well one must imitate exemplary authors. However, un-like Bembo he also believed that it was possible to construct a memory sys-tem which would permit one to create excellent texts in a rapid, simple and “artificial” process. Therefore, not only was his theatre of memory intended as a repository of all knowledge and an encyclopaedic container, it was also con-ceived as a literary memory machine. Camillo spent years fragmenting great literary texts – subjecting them, as he put it, to an anatomical dissection. Just as in the anatomical theatres – which were at that very time being established at the universities of Padua and Bologna – his aim was to render visible and available the fruits of his dissections. Furthermore, as in the alchemist’s work-room, these components were intended to be used and recombined in such a way as to recreate life. Camillo’s theatre therefore contained within itself, in its loci or places, fragments derived from the texts of the great authors. The images that are arranged in each of the places function as imagines agentes, helping us to remember the layout of the theatre and on each subsequent consultation aiding our discovery of whatever is needed. The user therefore has at his ready use and disposal fragments which he may breath back into life through the creation of a new text endowed with the potential of recapturing the secret of their original beauty. What we are confronted with here is a version of the canon of imitation that is at once artificial and metaphysical.From a philosophical point of view Camillo was fundamentally a syncretist; analogously to Pico della Mirandola, he was engaged in a search for the com-mon elements that united different philosophical and religious traditions, the first principles that lay hidden at the bottom of the texts and which only a select few, versed in the neoplatonic, hermetic and kabbalistic traditions, were capable of reading. Camillo was, however, less interested in abstract philo-sophical principles than in the results that could be obtained through their application; the goal of his reinterpretation of philosophical traditions was to demonstrate that his theatre could actually work.To grasp the meaning of his project, we must first of all examine a whole gal-axy of texts in Camillo’s hand, the greater part of which were still unpublished when he died. The work that presents in detail the schema for his project, L’idea del theatro, first appeared in print in 1550, six years after his death. The very genesis of this work is enveloped in legend: Girolamo Muzio, a close friend of Camillo’s, claimed that the text had been dictated to him by Camillo in the white heat of inspiration lasting just 7 mornings.4 This may be interpretable as a metaphor, however, since the number seven had an occult significance and 4 Girolamo Muzio recounts this episode in a letter: see Muzio, Lettere, 73."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"69The Memory Theatre of Giulio Camillo<UN>Camillo organized his theatre and its contents around this number. What is more, manuscripts containing alternative versions of this theatre have gradu-ally surfaced, while other texts, both published and unpublished, shed new light on its secret structure.Camillo’s theatre was conceived as a universal memory system, containing not only all the words and rhetorical artifices necessary to compose persua-sive texts, but all of man’s knowledge as well. Camillo presents his theatre as a mystery, as a divine secret that must not be divulged. According to the au-thor it was precisely this aspect that set his memory system apart from all the others. Its loci and images were not arbitrary nor human in nature, but divine and linked to the secret, hidden structure of reality itself. His theatre was a mens artificialis and a mens fenestrata – an artificial mind and a mind which was endowed with windows – a machine designed to draw from the inner soul the images which were buried there, by rendering them newly visible. In this way his theatre functioned by reconstituting the unitary and universal dimen-sion of the world, which in human experience is fragmented into the thousand rivulets of individual events.Camillo notes that he chose the model of the theatre because in Greek the root of the word ‘theatre’ was the same as that of the verb ‘to see’. This model was apparently influenced by the rediscovery of the Roman amphitheatre on the part of Renaissance architects. At the same time Camillo’s theatre was a model for the mind, a grid for the classification of reality made up of forty-nine principal loci originating from the intersection of the seven elements of a verti-cal order (the seven columns, or portals, representing the seven planets) with the seven elements of a horizontal order (the seven steps). The loci represent the expansion of unity into plurality, and the images which designate these loci can imprint in the memory the different phases, or more precisely the differ-ent aspects, of a process that begins within the profound nature of the divine and goes on to manifest itself in nature, in man, and in his myriad activities, including the arts and sciences. On the first step of the theatre we find rep-resented the seven planets – in accordance with the iconographic tradition of antiquity – in human form. The doctrine of astrological correspondences sanctions their use as an initial, basic criterion for a universal classification system. But this is merely the first level of signification. Camillo then weaves around the seven planets a complex web of meanings and correspondences, in which different philosophical and religious traditions converge around the seven fundamental images to guarantee their universal truth. The seven plan-ets and the divinities that mythology associated them with thus correspond to the seven days of creation, to the first principles of Pythagorean and hermetic philosophy, and to the Sephiroth, the ten divine names or emanations of the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Bolzoni70<UN>Kabbalah. Let us see how Camillo reduces the ten original Sephiroth to seven, the mystical number on which his theatre was based:Salomon, in the ninth chapter of Proverbs, says: “Wisdom hath built her-self a house” and founded it upon seven columns. These columns, which symbolize most stable eternity, we must understand as being the seven Sephiroth of the Supercelestial world, which are the seven measures of the structure of the Celestial and the Inferior; in these are included the ideas of everything Celestial and Inferior. It is impossible to imagine any-thing not included in this number.5His theatre, Camillo explained, would retrace the tree of divine names but stop at the seventh Sefira – Binah – because this was the highest level to which the human intellect could aspire:Now, the most secret theologians, who are the Cabalists, say that Moses passed seven times through the seven Sephiroth without ever being able to pass Binah. They say that is the height to which the human intellect can be raised. ... Therefore, he climbed seven times seven, which is forty-nine, the number of the remission of sins. To which number Christ also turned, when he gave us the prayer that we call the Lord’s Prayer, inas-much as this prayer, according to the Hebrew text by Matthew, is made up of forty-nine words.6Camillo therefore terminates with the seventh name in the Sephiroth – Binah – and excludes the two highest emanations – Chokmah (Wisdom) and Keter (Crown) – a decision that was justified by the limits of the human intellect and the Christian revelation. In this way Camillo adapted the Sephiroth to fit the septenary schema of his theatre, and so drew up the following table of correspondences between the planets, the Sephiroth, and the Angels (Table 3.1).In this manner Camillo re-elaborates for his own purposes a scholarly tradi-tion that sought to reconcile the Kabbalah with Christianity and whose prin-cipal exponents were Egidio da Viterbo, Annio da Viterbo, Francesco Zorzi (a Franciscan friar whose work bore many points of similarity with his own), 5 Camillo, L’idea del theatro, 51.

And indeed he believed the underlying purpose of his project to be completely different. Camillo wished to demonstrate how the various philosophical and religious traditions could converge, endowing him with magical powers. His aim was to create an instrument that would not only help those who use the Theatre to understand and remember universal knowl-edge, but would act directly on words, on things, and on the purification of the soul. As he tells us in an unpublished treatise titled De transmutatione, the secret objective of his theatre was to teach the three arts of metamorphosis: al-chemy, which acts on things; eloquence, which acts on words; and deification, which acts on the soul.7 At its most secret level, the theatre could operate in such a way as to allow the human mind to recover its universal dimension and the connection with its divine component. Here we can see the scheme which, according to Camillo, allows us to grasp the deep-seated correspondences that exist between alchemy, rhetoric and deification (Table 3.2). Arguably, therefore, the brief text titled De transmutatione, unpublished at the time of Camillo’s death, reveals the profound and secret nature of the Theatre.Camillo’s theatre was designed to function on various levels: as a kind of data bank for those wishing to write poems or orations; as an easily consult-able encyclopaedia; or – at its most rarified and secret level – as a guide to the opus of alchemy and deification.

In addition to serving, so to speak, as a great computer of literary memory, Camillo’s theatre was a vast iconographic storeroom. In its forty-nine principle sites and in their internal subdivisions, more than one hundred images are arranged. These were drawn from a cultural tradition which was visualised and reduced to topical types. For this reason they encode a memory that, through the process of reception, by means of an appropriate hermeneutic process, can in its turn assume new forms, aiding the production of new texts and new images.We know that Camillo actually commissioned artists to depict the images in his theatre. Vasari notes that when he was in Rome, around 1535, Camillo entrusted this task to Francesco called “de’ Salviati”: Camillo ‘had made a book of his compositions, for the purpose of sending them into France to king Fran-cis, and he now caused this book to be adorned with pictures by Francesco [Salviati] who executed this task with all the zeal and diligence which it was possible to bestow on a work of such character.’9 This splendid manuscript, sadly, has not survived. The great fire which damaged El Escorial in 1671 also destroyed the precious copy of Idea del theatro, illustrated by 201 paintings by Titian in watercolour on vellum, which is mentioned in the inventory of the Escorial library compiled by Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, the Spanish ambas-sador in Rome, to whom the first edition of Camillo’s work was dedicated.108 Cf.

However, in some instances we are assisted by the correspondences between the images which Camillo describes and the works of the artists whom he employed. This is the case with the cel-ebrated painting by Titian held in the National Gallery of London, depicting three double heads of men and animals (Fig. 3.1).11 It is interesting to note that here we are actually dealing with an emblem: the three human faces that, in 11 See also for further bibliographic references, Rossi, Allegoria della Prudenza, 44.Figure 3.1 Titian, Allegory of Prudence, c. 1565–1570Courtesy of the National Gallery, London"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Bolzoni74<UN>correspondence with the three animals, represent the three faces of time, are surmounted by an inscription which functions as a motto, ‘Ex praeterito, prae-sens prudenter agit ne futurum actionem deturpet’ (From the experience of the past, the present acts prudently in order not to compromise future action).The motto therefore guides us in our reception of the image, helping us to reconstruct the chain of associations which engendered it. What we are look-ing at is a classic representation of sapientia, born of the memory of the past, which will aid us in our dealings with the future. However, the three animal heads also introduce a much more disquieting dimension. We may here look at the passage from Camillo’s text which, by means of a citation from Macrobius, conjures up to our memory Serapis, the Egyptian goddess who controlled time:The three heads of the wolf, the lion and the dog have been so, Macro-bius writes, that the ancients, wishing to illustrate the three times, that is the past, the present and the future, painted the three above-mentioned heads. That of the wolf signifies time past, for the reason that he has al-ready devoured it. That of the lion is the present, if the present can be envisaged, in that present trials and tribulations strike such great terror in us, as would the face of a lion if we encountered it. And the head of the dog indicates the future, as would a fawning dog, the future always holds the promise of better things. Therefore, this image shall include these three Saturnine times and their attributes.12 The three heads thus become an imago agens, endowed with the power of striking our imagi-nations, of moving us, and capable therefore of fixing itself in our minds. We encounter this image for the first time at the third level of the theatre, where we find the natural world, represented by a cave in which nymphs sit weaving purple cloth and bees make honey. The three heads are locat-ed on the column of Saturn, who superintends the primary divisions of time and who is linked to the melancholy temperament,13 one of whose characteristics is an excellent memory. But, as is the case with other im-ages in the theatre, the three heads can be moved, shifting across the chessboard of luoghi and assuming new meanings and connotations along the way. Thus we find them once again, still fixed to Saturn’s col-umn, on the fifth level of the theatre, where the image of Pasiphaë with the bull represents the human body (‘the three heads, of the wolf, the lion and the dog, signify man subject to the passage of time’14), and finally, on 12 Camillo, L’idea del theatro, 110–111.

Here our disquieting and mysterious image simply signifies: ‘take pause, and give others time, set a boundary, postpone to future times’.15There are numerous other examples of a correspondence between emblems or devices and images from Camillo’s theatre. Here we shall examine just a few examples. In the first, the emblem is derived directly from the Theatre. This is the case of the flying crane cited in Camillo Camilli’s work Imprese illustri (Illustrious devices, 1586)16 (Fig. 3.2). The crane carries in its beak a caduceus (a herald’s wand) and in its claws a quiver from which arrows fall, interspersed with the motto ‘Volabo et requiescam’ (I will fly and I will rest). Alessandro Canobio, the author of this emblem, designed it for himself and its aim is to ex-press the ideal of detachment from earthly concerns and to exalt the vigilance which must be exercised to attain such an ideal. The concept of “vigilance” is traditionally represented by the crane, who holds a stone clenched in its claws 15 Ibid., 159.16 Camilli, Imprese illustri di diversi, ii, n. 32.Figure 3.2 Emblem with the Crane, in Camilli, Imprese illustri di diversi (Venice, 1586), II, n. 32"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Bolzoni76<UN>so as not to fall asleep. This image of the crane, Camilli tells us, comes from Giulio Camillo’s theatre:This mysterious image, elegantly used for a device, derives from Giulio Camillo’s Idea del teatro, where I have seen, at the level of the Gorgons, the description of this very figure. Now I, by explaining each part of it, will also make known to the reader the just and pious spirit of its author [that is Canobbio], who has removed it from there and applied it to his most noble intention.17Camilli’s interpretation of every component of the image exactly corresponds with Giulio Camillo’s text. Similarly, a large number of the associations created by the reading of the Theatre find their way into Camilli’s final poem, which transforms the emblem into a portrait of the soul of its author, Canobbio. This is an example of how an image from Camillo’s theatre could become an em-blem and how Camilli used the topical associations to construct a laudatory poem.One figure that recurs both in the images contained in Camillo’s theatre and in many published collections of emblems, is that of Ixion, eternally bound to a revolving wheel as a punishment for his sin of lust. In Camillo’s text Ixion is placed on the column of Mercury and while representing, on the fifth level, “worldly cares”, on the sixth level he signifies ‘to give or receive engagements, furnish, investigate, vigilance, industry, diligence, perseverance, toil’.18In the collection of emblems by Camilli, Ixion on his wheel also appears, accompanied by the motto ‘If but highly’ (Pur che altamente) (Fig. 3.3); here he is the emblem of Giulio Mosti, used as an expression of his willingness to suffer for unrequited love, but a love directed towards a much more elevated object. It is interesting to observe how the motto of the emblem seeks to de-limit the memory related to the myth, to circumscribe the web of associations by guiding the reader/spectator step by step across the topica provided for the construction and interpretation of the image. According to Camilli, this is not a case requiring the use of an analogy, which would lead to the erroneous conclusion that Giulio Mosti was mad, just as Ixion went mad when he was punished for betraying his father-in-law. One must instead ‘pass beyond the knowledge of the causality’. One must know and remember the reason for the punishment, which was the ardent love that Ixion bore for Hera:17 Ibid., ii, 22.18 Camillo, L’idea del theatro, 151 and 162."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"77The Memory Theatre of Giulio Camillo<UN>Figure 3.3 Emblem with Ixion, in Camilli, Imprese illustri di diversi (Venice, 1586), III, 13And without giving any regard to anything else, we must consider his most noble and praiseworthy intention, because we have to use only the similes which serve our purpose without wasting time with too much quibbling, and investigating the thing itself with which we figure our thought, without pausing on other accidentals which prove against our intention, and which ... are such that it would be folly to say that the au-thor, whoever he might be, might have actually envisaged them.19This comment by Camillo Camilli exemplifies the application of a moral geog-raphy, as it were, to the interpretative act: it involves the individuation of the correct itinerary across the grid of topical places (as the simile, the cause) and the selection in this way of the different associations which the memory of the myth make available for particular use.It would be extremely interesting to carry out a systematic study of the af-terlife of the images used by Camillo in his theatre, though this would certainly prove to be a complex research, as often these images hark back to a shared 19 Camilli, Imprese illustri di diversi, iii, 13."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Bolzoni78<UN>literary, philosophical or antiquarian memory, making it arduous to establish in each instance, which source is more immediately vivid or predominant.

I wish to consider the ways in which the German humanist constructs and represents a common Renaissance image of the universe in his De occulta philosophia. This image is of pivotal importance for understanding Agrippa’s peculiar worldview as it provides a conceptual framework in which he develops his multilayered and heterodox thought. In other words, I deal with Agrippa’s cosmology in the context of his magical the-ory. The main conclusion of my analysis is that Agrippa’s approach to this topic is remarkably non-visual and that his symbolism is largely of verbal nature, revealing an author predominantly concerned with the nature of discursive language and the linguistic implications of magical thinking.The De occulta philosophia is the largest, most important, and most complex among the works of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486–1535). It is a summa of practically all the esoteric doctrines and magical practices ac-cessible to the author. As is well known and discussed in scholarship, this vast and diverse amount of material is organized within a tripartite structure that corresponds to the common Neoplatonic notion of a cosmic hierarchy. Thus the first book deals with natural magic corresponding to the physical realm, the second with astral or mathematical magic corresponding to the celestial realm, and the third with ceremonial or ritual magic corresponding to the in-tellectual realm of the created world.2 Each of these three parts embraces a 1 I would like to thank Professors György E. Szőnyi and Peter J. Forshaw for their invaluable help and support in writing this paper.2 Although Agrippa was largely ignored or belittled by earlier generations of scholars, this perception changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Within the past few de-cades a number of works have appeared which examine the cosmological aspects of the De occulta philosophia in the larger historical context of Agrippa’s time; see, for instance,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Putnik82<UN>number of doctrines and practices coming from different esoteric traditions – ranging from late Hellenistic Neoplatonism and Hermetism through medieval magic and Kabbalah to the doctrines of Florentine Neoplatonists and Christian Cabalists – which Cornelius Agrippa expounds and interconnects according to his hierarchical scheme. The final form and the content of this work are the result of a long and complex creative process – one should remember that the juvenile draft Agrippa presented to the abbot Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) in 1510 differs greatly from the final version published in 1533. The former is considerably shorter and structured differently.3 Certainly, it is extremely dif-ficult to analyze this work from the viewpoint of consistency, due to more than two decades of revising and rewriting the text, with an ever increasing body of both credited and uncredited sources Agrippa relied upon.It is often (perhaps too often) stated that this monumental synthesis is nei-ther an original contribution to the study of magic nor a practical manual. A considerable body of modern scholarship has not done justice to the Net-tesheimer’s legacy in viewing him simply as an encyclopedist and compiler who, to use Christopher I. Lehrich’s words, ‘merely collected odd bits of obscure knowledge and fantasy.’4 Following Lehrich, and some other scholars such as Vittoria Perrone Compagni and Marc Van der Poel, I maintain that behind the compilatory structure of the De occulta philosophia one can detect the work of a considerably coherent thinker and a relatively creative exegete. The weight of Agrippa’s interpretation is precisely in providing an all-encompassing cos-mological and theological framework for what had reached his time as a jum-ble of heterodox philosophies, odd practices, obscure beliefs, superstition, and strange literary reminiscences.5Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic, 90–96; Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradi-tion, 146–160; Nauert, Agrippa and the Crisis of Renaissance Thought, 220–259; Lehrich, The Language of Demons and Angels, 36–42; Szőnyi, John Dee’s Occultism, 110–120, etc. Hermann F.W. Kuhlow has dedicated his doctoral thesis to Agrippa’s cosmology and its religious impli-cations; see Kuhlow, Die Imitatio Christi und ihre kosmologische Überfremdung.3 The juvenile version is preserved in its original form at the University Library of Würzburg, Universitätsbibliothek, ms.

Coherence in some aspects, however, does not rule out the possibility of tensions and contradictions in some others, more emphasized by scholars such"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"83Agrippa’s Cosmic Ladder<UN>The main intention of the author of the De occulta philosophia is to rehabili-tate and re-establish magic in its original, incorrupt form, as Agrippa declares in a letter to Trithemius attached to the first book of his work.6 He views magic as the most sublime ancient form of philosophy and religion which had de-generated due to the misuse and ignorance of those who applied it. It is now his task to vindicate the honorable name of magic and make it acceptable to the general Christian public if not to the Church. In order to do this, it is not enough merely to catalog all the existing forms of magic and separate the au-thentic from the false; one needs to put magic into a broader philosophical and theological context within which one should be able to prove the genuine value and purpose of magic. Certainly, Agrippa had many predecessors in this enterprise; to mention only Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) is already more than enough. However, what differentiates him from his predecessors is the scope as well as the daring of his vindication of magic.What then would be the lost original purpose of that ‘sublime ancient phi-losophy’ according to Agrippa von Nettesheim? In the very first sentence of his De occulta philosophia he answers that question and delineates a whole magi-cal program that he develops in the rest of the work:7Seeing that there is a threefold world, elementary, celestial, and intellec-tual, and that every inferior is governed by its superior and receives the influence of the virtues thereof, so that the very original and chief Worker of all does by angels, heavens, stars, elements, animals, plants, metals, and stones convey from himself the virtues of his omnipotence upon us, for whose service he made and created all these things, wise men con-ceive it no way irrational that it should be possible for us to ascend by the same degrees through each world, to the same very original world itself, the Maker of all things and First Cause, from whence all things are and proceed, and also to enjoy not only these virtues which are already in the more excellent kind of things, but also besides these, to draw new virtues from above.8as Michael H. Keefer and György E. Szőnyi; see Keefer, ‘Agrippa’s Dilemma’, 614–653, and Szőnyi, John Dee’s Occultism, 128–131.6 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 68.

Moreover, the author is keen to emphasize that the created world is not static and uniform: ‘every inferior is governed by its superior and receives the influence of the virtues thereof ’ means that the three postulated worlds are structured hierarchically as a result of the process of divine emana-tion. The ‘chief Worker of all’, ‘the Maker of all things and First Cause’ – that is, God – does not merely create the world; he invests it with his omnipotence which flows down continuously through the created chain of beings, starting from angels and stars and ending with metals and stones.11 God’s divine virtues ministerium haec omnia condidit atque creavit, non irrationabile putant magi nos per eosdem gradus, per singulos mundos, ad eundem ipsum archetypum mundum, omnium opificem et primam causam, a qua sunt omnia et procedunt omnia, posse conscende-re: et non solum his viribus quae in rebus nobilioribus praeexistunt frui posse, sed alias praeterea novas desuper posse attrahere.’ Although the “close reading” of one single para-graph might seem a methodologically backward extrapolation similar to the methods of traditional Christian exegesis, I maintain that each word in the first paragraph is a result of a carefully planned scheme and a meticulous selection revealing or announcing the author’s projected intentions. In general, I base my approach on the methodology of tex-tual criticism and philology as delineated by Hanegraaff, ‘Altered States of Knowledge’, 129–133, as well as on the “close reading” approach as formulated by Lehrich, The Lan-guage of Demons and Angels, 213.9 Italics mine. Just in passing, note the interesting way James Freake chose to render the Latin magi as ‘wise men’.10 Agrippa’s notion of triplex mundus comes directly from Pico’s Heptaplus and Reuchlin’s De arte cabbalistica, as indicated by V. Perrone Compagni; see Agrippa, De occulta philoso-phia, 86.11 The “great chain of being” as a theoretical concept was introduced by Arthur O. Love-joy in his classic The Great Chain of Being. It was further developed by S.K. Heninger in his Touches of Sweet Harmony and The Cosmographycal Glass, and by a great number of other scholars. For a discussion of the concept more particularly applied to Renaissance Neoplatonists see Szőnyi, John Dee’s Occultism, 24–34, and Hanegraaff, ‘Under the Man-tle of Love’, 178–182.

He views"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"85Agrippa’s Cosmic Ladder<UN>are distributed vertically, in such a manner that every preceding level of cre-ation rules the one below. Agrippa sees this outpouring of God’s essence – or at least his virtues if not the essence – as a natural process, which then leaves the way back also naturally open. This is emphasized by the important words non irrationabile, which conceal, as if in a nutshell, a philosophical justification and defense of magic confronted with the inimical and suspicious mainstream theology. The magician (not Freake’s euphemistic “wise man”) perceives this whole process of natural emanation and comes to an utterly rational conclu-sion that it is possible to climb back to transcendence by using the same cos-mic ladder. Thus Agrippa proclaims the main goal of his magic: to return to the One from whom all things proceed and to share in his omnipotence.12 In other words, the aim of Agrippa’s magician is clearly some sort of ascension and deification. To use Moshe Idel’s words, he wants to become ‘capable of touching or being touched by the divine’13 with a delicate accent on gaining divine powers. The whole idea rests on a logical and causal connection that Agrippa establishes between the possibility of ascent and the factual descent of the divine virtues through the process of emanation. It is precisely the latter that enables the former and, to emphasize it once again, makes it a natural and “rational” idea.A simple diagram (Fig. 4.1) can show this interdependence within the given cosmic structure. As evident, Agrippa’s scheme of emanation is clearly Neopla-tonic: there is a first cause (prima causa) or the Maker of all things (omnium opifex), from whom all things proceed in three successive stages known as the intellectual, the celestial, and the elementary or physical world.14 It is important to note that, in Agrippa’s understanding, emanation is also seen as theophany since God relegates, deposits his divine virtues, such as omnipotence, in every stage and every aspect of the created world.15 God is simultaneously transcen-dent and immanent, and it is precisely his immanence that a magician should the former as being intrinsically “passive”, but it appears that Agrippa’s and Pico della Mirandola’s interpretations of the great chain of being suggest a middle case somewhere between the two compared paradigms.12 See also Kuhlow, Die Imitatio Christi, 30–33.13 Idel, Ascensions on High in Jewish Mysticism, 23. This is what György E. Szőnyi calls exal-tatio; see his elaboration of this concept in Szőnyi, John Dee’s Occultism, 34–37. The term deificatio, with all its ambivalent connotations, has also been used by scholars in this con-text, see Brach, ‘Magic’, 731–738. On the origin and particulars of Agrippa’s idea of ascen-sion see Putnik, The Pious Impiety of Agrippa’s Magic, 33–65.14 The ultimate source of Agrippa’s doctrine of emanation is undoubtedly Plotinus, Enneads v 1–2, but see also note 11 of this essay.15 Perhaps the best example is Agrippa’s description of the emanation of light (Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 177–180): it begins its way downwards from God the Father as a divine"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Putnik86<UN>utilize to reach transcendence. All the emanated levels are united under the rule of interdependence and such a structure allows for the possibility of influ-ence and communication between the worlds. One should also note that the line on the diagram dividing the created world from the realm of transcen-dence is broken. It is to imply that in Agrippa’s Neoplatonic understanding of the universe there is no clear ontological boundary and gap between the Creator and his creation so peculiar to Christian theology. Another ontological implication, as Ernst Cassirer pointed out long ago, is that the created world is no longer seen as a static creation of the Christian God; it is no longer a “non-being” of Christian theology, but a dynamic living organism, a “symbol” reflect-ing the original world.16What one finds then in the very first sentence is a condensed image of a living, dynamic universe which links God and man through a two-directional chain of successive stages.virtue, ‘the first true light’ (prima vera lux), and ends up as the physical phenomenon vis-ible to our eyes (visibilis claritas).16 Cassirer, Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophie und Wissenschaft der neueren Zeit, 155.

In a living world, or-ganically connected with its Creator and pervaded by his spirit, everything is connected with everything. Different aspects of the created world are inter-related either on the basis of being composed of the common four elements (however, on different levels of subtlety) or being pervaded by the “occult vir-tues”, which are termed so, in Agrippa’s words, ‘because their causes lie hidden, and man’s intellect cannot in any way reach and find them out’.17 In either case, a skilled person, a physician or a magician, is able to track the occult relations between things and use them to exert a certain influence upon someone or something outside themselves. Agrippa speaks of these relations in terms of natural sympathies and antipathies, or “friendship” and “enmity”. Yet another level of correspondences, overarching all the other levels, is that between the macro- and microcosms, in other words, the universe and man.Significantly, Agrippa does not limit the classical four elements to the el-ementary and celestial worlds. Earth, just like the other three, is to be found on all levels of existence, even in the realm of transcendence:It is the unanimous consent of all Platonists that as in the original and exemplary world all things are in all, so also in this corporeal world all things are in all [although in different modes, according to the nature of each thing]. So also the elements are not only in these inferior bodies, but also in the heavens, in stars, in devils, in angels, and lastly in God, the maker and original example of all things.18In their ontologically highest forms, the elements are Ideas abiding in God. Describing the gradual descent of Ideas into increasingly gross forms, Agrippa concludes that ‘every species has its celestial shape, or figure that is suitable to it, from which also proceeds a wonderful power of operating, and it receives this proper gift from its own Idea, through the seminal forms of the Soul of the 17 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 105: ‘quia causae earum latentes sunt, ita quod humanus intellectus non potest eas usquequaque investigare.’18 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 101: ‘Est Platonicorum omnium unanimis sententia, quemadmodum in archetypo mundo omnia sunt in omnibus, ita etiam in hoc corporeo mundo omnia sunt in omnibus esse, modis tamen diversis, pro natura videlicet suscipien-tium: sic et elementa non solum sunt in istis inferioribus, sed et in coelis, in stellis, in dae-monibus, in angelis, in ipso denique omnium Opifice et Archetypo.’ The bracketed words are missing in Freake’s translation. Perrone Compagni traces this idea back to Ficino, In Tym., 24."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Putnik88<UN>World’.19 In other words, it is a common ontological “backbone” of the hierar-chically structured universe that makes any magical operatio possible.20This idea is perhaps best visually expressed in a diagram made by Robert Fludd (1574–1637) (Fig. 4.2) in his early seventeenth-century work titled Utri-usque cosmi, maioris scilicet et minoris, metaphysica, physica, atque technica historia (1617–21): two opposite triangles represent the so-called “formal” and “material” pyramids that connect all the levels of the creation with the Creator. On its way down every Idea, as a pure spiritual and conceptual form, loses in its formality and acquires increasingly gross material components, with the earth as the basis of the material pyramid and the symbol of the Holy Trinity as the basis of the formal one. If the formal pyramid stands for the process of emanation, the material stands for the magician’s ascent to the transcendental domain.Within this conceptual framework Agrippa develops his well-known tripar-tite typology of magic which embraces traditions as diverse as ancient Greek natural philosophy, medieval talismanic magic, and Kabbalah. They all serve one and the same purpose: the magician’s rise to power, crowned with the res-toration of his prelapsarian, Adamic state, in which he once partook of the eternal omniscience and omnipotence of God.Agrippa begins with natural magic, seeking the occult virtues of things in the realms of herbs, animals, stones, and so forth, and then moves on to the ce-lestial sphere, in which he utilizes its basic elements – numbers and planets – by means of celestial images, geometry, and astrology. Finally, he reaches the intellectual sphere, in which he employs forms of magic closest to religion: attaining ritual purity, deriving angelic and demonic names, their characters and seals, summoning spirits, etc.Given all outlined above, it may come as a surprise that the editions of the De occulta philosophia published during Agrippa’s lifetime and prepared by him contain practically no visual representations of any of these pivotal con-cepts. Images in these editions are by and large limited to the representations of magical seals and astrological symbols, with only a few anthopomorphic 19 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 107: ‘quaelibet species habeat figuram coelestem sibi convenientem, ex qua etiam provenit sibi mirabilis potestas in operando, qualem per ra-tiones animae mundi seminales propriam ab idea sua suscipit dotem.’20 Here, like in many other cases, Agrippa heavily relies on Ficino without referring to him but, as usual, to the unnamed Platonici. Ficino emphasizes the homogeneity of the ele-mental and celestial regions and claims that the elements exist in the metaphysical realm too, thus forming a link in a causal change extending from the ideas of the elements in the Divine Mind to the physical world; see Hankins, Humanism and Platonism in the Italian Renaissance ii, 169–172."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"89Agrippa’s Cosmic Ladder<UN>emblematic representations.

The Great Chain of Being is represented by its explicit physical metaphor, linking God with man through the medium of Anima mundi (World Soul). Man is repre-sented in an ape-like form as the imitator of Nature or the so-called “lesser world”.24 The three spheres, physical, celestial, and intellectual, are also clearly visible and represented by the creatures or entities inhabiting them.Symbolic images such as this one were fairly common in early modern trea-tises on cosmology, natural philosophy, magic, and similar disciplines. But why are they entirely absent from Agrippa’s work? Given the importance he attrib-uted to the cosmological framework of his magical theory, one would expect to find elaborate diagrams and images of this kind. However, there are none and this curious absence is something to be considered.The immediate reasons appear to be evident. To begin with, one should have in mind that medieval and ancient authors did not make as sharp a dis-tinction between the verbal and the visual as we do nowadays.25 However, to say that Agrippa simply did not care for visual language would be an easy way out. The distinction in question began to emerge more and more clearly in the early modern period, as indicated by the appearance of a whole new genre of emblem books, and one wonders what makes the Nettesheimer an exception in this regard.the category matches Agrippa’s use of characters too: they can be understood as parts of ‘a secret vocabulary composed of cryptographic and hieroglyphic ciphers, such as geometri-cal shapes’. Conversely, it might be argued that Agrippa treated his characters as letters, not as images, emphasizing their semantic component.23 This is the case with many modern editions, e.g. Agrippa, Three Books of Occult Philosophy (Donald Tyson’s annotated and richly illustrated edition of Freake’s translation).24 It should be noted that, although he discusses the “minor mundus” concept throughout his work (see, for instance, De occulta philosophia 148, 155, 328, 507), Agrippa himself does not use the ape-metaphor.25 See Gombrich, Symbolic Images, 129. Reflecting on this permeability between artistic me-dia and genres, he adds: ‘Poetry could be didactic, and teaching or preaching poetic’. In extension of this thought, one could say that Agrippa used verbal language to depict cer-tain concepts just as later emblem books used images to explain them."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"91Agrippa’s Cosmic Ladder<UN>Undoubtedly the time factor played a significant role in his case. As is well known, Agrippa finally managed to have his De occulta philosophia printed only in 1531 (the first book) and in 1533 (the integral version). Given the mani-fold difficulties accompanying Agrippa’s attempts to publicise his life’s work (such as his incarceration or the famous condemnations by the theologians of the Sorbonne and Louvain),26 it would be difficult to imagine the German humanist searching for a suitable artist to decorate his work with illustrations 26 See Nauert, Agrippa and the Crisis of Renaissance Thought, 104–115.Figure 4.3 Robert Fludd, Utriusque Cosmi ...

Even more imporatantly, the genre of emblem book, which would inaugurate a whole new model of symbolic communication and become highly influential, was only beginning to emerge around the time of the publishing of Agrippa’s work. Andreas Alciato’s Emblemata, the first em-blem book of all, appeared in 1531 and was followed and emulated by many in the ensuing decades, yet too late for Agrippa to be influenced by this new literary fashion. Its influence is clearly seen in the practice of illustrating new editions or translations of old books, such as Petrus Bonus’s Pretiosa margar-ita novella (1546) or the first French translation of Horapollo’s Hieroglyphica (1543)27 – something that was in store for some latter editions of the De occulta philosophia too.Horapollo is a useful example in this context. Agrippa refers to him a num-ber of times, especially in terms of animal symbolism discussed in the first book of his occult encyclopedia,28 which indicates that he read either the first Latin translation by Bernardino Trebazio (Augsburg, 1515) or the second one by Filippo Fasanini (Bologna, 1517), if not the Greek editio princeps published by Manutius in 1505. However, none of these editions contains extensive illustra-tions; as mentioned above, it is only in the 1543 French translation that a large number of engravings appear, which thus parallels the pattern observed in the De occulta philosophia.29However, all this is not sufficient to fully account for the scarcity of images in the De occulta philosophia. After all, illustrated books existed throughout the Middle Ages and Agrippa’s focus on words definitely surpasses the above-mentioned limitations of the historical context. Thus I propose to cast another glance at Agrippa’s strategy of treating this topic by using verbal devices only. In line with what might be termed a “lingustic turn” in present-day scholarship on the German humanist, I maintain that this was a deliberate approach of a man whose attention was focused primarily on the various issues of discursive language and its applicability to magic.By linguistic turn I have in mind a gradual shift of scholarly attention from what Agrippa wrote about to how he did it, in other words, from the content of his writings to the literary devices and rhetorical strategies he employed in shaping and articulating it. This change of perspective has opened up a number 27 See Forshaw, ‘Alchemy in the Amphitheatre’, 196–197.28 See, for instance, Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 120–121. For other examples see Perrone Compagni’s Index nominum, s. v.

For instance, the scru-tiny of Agrippa’s works from the viewpoint of literary genres has considerably reduced the previously perceived tension of his “contradictory” intellectual position. Thus by examining Agrippa’s De vanitate as part of the Renaissance literary genre of paradox, in which the author intentionally changes tonal reg-isters and creates different authorial voices, Barabara Bowen downplays this old interpretive conundrum as a “false problem30”. In a similar vein, Eugene Korkowski approaches this work as an example of mock-epideictic literature, showing that Agrippa’s meticulous use of irony and other literary devices characteristic of Menippean satire helped articulate a multilayered, polypho-nous message intended for various types of readers.31 Michael Keefer analyzes Agrippa’s apparently deliberate custom of misquoting his biblical sources as a way of legitimizing his heterodox views by what appears to be verbal ma-nipulation.32 Marc van der Poel examines several of Agrippa’s works in relation to Ciceronian declamation and its reception in the Renaissance as a form of highly rhetoricized biblical exegesis widely used at the time.33 Finally, Christo-pher Lehrich offers a radically new interpretation of the De occulta philosophia by basing his analysis on critical theory and modern philosophy of language.34The common thread of all these approaches is the assumption that Agrippa did not see language as founded on the notions of fixity and identity and that consequently each of his texts can be viewed, to put it in Chris Miles’s words, as ‘a complex and bewildering matrix of authorial tones and implied (or invoked) readers that are presented in cross-conversation with each other’.35 What fol-lows is that the symbolism of Agrippa’s language is by no means exhausted in metaphor and allegory. It reaches metalingustic levels where the very structure of his works, the alteration of authorial voices, the skillful use of the shifting 30 Bowen, ‘Cornelius Agrippa’s De Vanitate: Polemic or Paradox?’ quote on 256.31 Korkowski, ‘Agrippa as Ironist’.32 Keefer, ‘Agrippa’s Dilemma’. To Keefer’s examples of misquoting scriptural authorities one might add Agrippa’s frequent use of recontextualizing, as I demonstrated in Putnik, ‘Scriptural Obscurity as a Theological Way Out’.33 Van der Poel, Agrippa, the Humanist Theologian.34 Lehrich, The Language of Demons and Angels. Some of his conclusions will be considered in more detail below. Chris Miles, ‘Occult Retraction’, follows Lehrich’s line of interpreta-tion, but with a tendency to overinterpret him. Relying on a rhetorical analysis of a few selected passages from the De occulta philosophia he attributes Agrippa a belief in the nonexistence of the relation between language and the world, resulting in fundamental mistrust in any human language’s ability to convey truth.35 Miles, ‘Occult Retraction’, 444."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Putnik94<UN>nature of discourse often serve to point the reader to something other or more than the plain text suggests.36As Christopher Lehrich points out, the De occulta philosophia is mainly concerned with the problem of communication: How does the natural world communicate with the divine? How does a magician utilize these channels of communication to attain his goal?37 These questions lie at the heart of Agrippa’s interest. Although he discusses various types of communication (such as the “language” of animals, plants and minerals), it is evident from the second and the third books of the De occulta philosophia that linguistic com-munication forms the core of his magical theory.How does the structure of the work itself reflect Agrippa’s concern with discursive language? To begin in a somewhat reverse order, communication forms the main topic of the third book of De occulta philosophia, which is argu-ably the focal point of the whole work. One finds there an elaborate discussion of the nature of divine names, the nature and names of intelligences, demons, and angels, the language of angels, as well as different methods of deriving angelic and demonic names and of summoning spirits. Throughout the book the author implies that the purpose of all ritual magic is to attain transparent communication between the magus and God. Or, to paraphrase Lehrich, one could say that, according to the German humanist, God writes his message upon the magus, and the magus translates that message into the speech of the world.38 In other words, one finds in Agrippa’s notion of magic a direct cor-respondence between the linguistic and the ontological spheres. As I suggest below, this is precisely the meeting point between the two allegedly opposed facets of Agrippa’s personality as projected in his writings: that of a devout Christian and of a heterodox magus.Furthermore, it is indicative that Agrippa ends both preceding books with sections dedicated to linguistic issues. The first book, which deals with natu-ral magic (and thus, presumably, with non-linguistic issues), ends somewhat 36 In the De occulta philosophia Agrippa openly speaks of his “dispersed intention” (dispersa intentio) as a literary strategy employed for the purpose of concealing magical doctrines from those incapable of understanding them properly (De occulta philosophia, 599–600). See also Perrone Compagni, ‘Dispersa Intentio: Alchemy, Magic and Scepticism in Agrip-pa’, 161–162.Miles, ‘Occult Retraction’, 444.37 Lehrich, The Language of Demons and Angels, 97. Therefore, this problem should also be considered in the framework of premodern semiotics as discussed by Szőnyi, ‘From the Hieroglyphic Monad to Angel Magic’, 109–114. Agrippa’s approach can also be interpreted as “the Quest for a Code”, spanning the entire range from semiotic to ontological ambigui-ties that plagued the skeptical magus.38 Lehrich, The Language of Demons and Angels, 209."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"95Agrippa’s Cosmic Ladder<UN>surprisingly with a series of chapters, from 69 to 74, treating speech, both oral and written, the power of letters, words, sentences and names, as well as the power of enchantments and inscriptions.39 In fact, these are the chapters in which Agrippa expounds his “philosophy of language”, that is, an understand-ing of language on which the whole concept of magical invocation rests. Some of the crucial concepts discussed are the twofold nature of word, internal and uttered, and the twofold nature of language itself, divine (signifying by the influence of the celestial harmony) and arbitrary (signifying by human con-vention). Such a nature of language, which derives from the hierarchically structured correspondence of all the levels in the world but also entails human involvement, enables various forms of cross-leveled communication such as the summoning of various supernatural agents.40The second book also ends with a few linguistically-oriented chapters: on the names of the celestials and the planetary rulers, and on the ways in which to use these names for what Agrippa significantly terms magical speech (ser-mones magici).41 From the structural point of view, it is not by chance that the closing chapters of the first two books deal with language. These are transition-al chapters, serving to introduce the readers to a higher level of discussion and also to remind them of the basic idea of the work. Thus the fact that they deal with linguistic issues becomes even more significant. Finally, to emphasize it once again, the third book with its discussion on the divine names, the names 39 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 231–244.40 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 232. Considering this twofold nature of word, the inter-nal word (internum) is “conceptus mentis et motus animae”, whereas the uttered word (prolatum) carries a certain force or “energy” that affects the hearer (verbum prolatum quendam actum habet ... et virtutem loquentis energia quadam transfundenti in audientes). As for the twofold nature of language itself, it can be natural (virtus naturalis ... signifi-cans per influxum harmoniae coelestis) and arbitrary (virtus voluntaria ... significans per impositionem hominis, that is, by convention). It is the double nature of language that makes it most appropriate for magical operations (geminata virtute, naturali videlicet et voluntaria, nomen ad agendum redditur efficacissimum), just as the twofold nature of word makes it the fittest medium (aptissimum medium). Beside other considerations, it is Agrippa’s “virtus voluntaria” that has led some scholars such as Chris Miles to postulate his ‘belief in the arbitrariness of the sign’ (Miles, ‘Occult Retraction’, 451) and conviction that ‘Godhead cannot be approached through language’ (ibid., 454). In my opinion, it is a far-fetched conclusion if we confront it with Agrippa’s view that ‘the omnipotent God has by his providence divided the speech of men into diverse languages, which [are] ... not so disposed and formed by hap, or chance, nor by the weak judgement of men, but from above’ (Agrippa, Three Books of Occult Philosophy, 223; Latin original in Agrippa, De oc-culta philosophia, 241: ... non fortuito, nec casu, nec fragili hominum arbitrio, sed divinitus).41 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 389."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Putnik96<UN>of spirits, and the angelic language as related to the Hebrew is profoundly lin-guistic in its content and tone.In my perception, behind such an approach lies the author’s intention to “theologize” his magic by linking it to the doctrine of the Logos or Verbum Dei. Not only in the De occulta philosophia,42 but also in some other works such as his epistemological treatise on the three ways to know God (De triplici ratione cognoscendi Deum, 1516), the German humanist argues that the foundation of divine-natural communication in magic, just like in other spheres, has been laid by the Incarnation of Christ. In several instances Agrippa almost explic-itly equates Christ’s miracle-working with that of magicians, for the simple reason that he sees magical wonder-working as an indicator of one’s spiritual advancement. For a truly illuminated soul, Agrippa argues, it is only natural to perform works of magic and this is how the miracles of the prophets and the apostles are to be explained.43 Christ, being the Word of God, is the perfect, ultimate, and normative example of the magus upon whom God has written his message.As the first autonomous and fully developed exposition of Agrippa’s theo-logical tenets, the De triplici ratione holds an important place in his opus. Given the fact that this work was Agrippa’s major attempt to theologize his occult worldview in a systematic fashion, it can be used as one of the keys for interpreting the De occulta philosophia. It should come as no surprise that he refers to the three ways discussed in the De triplici ratione (i.e., the heathen, the Hebrew, and the Christian) as ‘books’ (libri) to be read, both literally and metaphorically.44 In addition to such a distinctly linguistic imagery that re-veals much about Agrippa’s epistemological stance, the work shows a peculiar 42 See, for instance, the opening chapter of the third book, Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 402–403, and note the frequent use of the expression operari per religionem.43 This is how Agrippa explicitly defines miracles in his De triplici ratione, 6, 16: ‘Magnum certe miraculum est homo Christianus, qui in mundo constitutus, supra mundum domi-natur operationesque similes efficit ipsi Creatori mundi: quae opera vulgo miracula ap-pellantur, quorum omnium radix et fundamentum fides est in Iesum Christum’ (Perrone Compagni, Ermetismo e Cristianesimo, 146, emphasis mine). One finds a similar idea in Fi-cino, Theol. plat. xiii, 4. On the basis of this conviction Agrippa attacks corruption in the church of his time: if the leaders of the church are unable to perform miraculous works like the apostles, it means they no longer possess the pure knowledge of the Revelation; see Perrone Compagni, Ermetismo e Cristianesimo, 154, and Nauert, ‘Agrippa in Renais-sance Italy’, 207.44 Perrone Compagni, Ermetismo e Cristianesimo, 102–105.

Through faith alone man is made somewhat the same with God and enjoys the same power.46In my opinion, this curious paraphrase as well as Agrippa’s daring definition of homo Christianus reveal his attempt to theologize magic by providing it a proper place under the umbrella of humanist theology while at the same time affording it a necessary stamp of orthodoxy. By performing ‘deeds similar to those of the Creator of the world’ one affirms one’s genuine piety and the pu-rity of Christian faith. At the same time, Christianity (being the most sublime of all religions, as Agrippa demonstrates in his treatise) provides the best pos-sible preparation and protection for the magus in his project of ascension to supernatural power. In other words, it serves both as a praeparatio magica and a means for discretio spirituum, a point of particular importance for the au-thor of the De occulta philosophia.47 The conceptual framework of the De tri-plici ratione enables one a better understanding of notions such as operari per the most perfect, to the Christians. The overarching context is that of a parallel spiritual tradition based on the Ficinian notion of the twofold Revelation, exoteric and esoteric.45 Ascl. 3, f. 40v.

In the ensuing sentence Agrippa explains the result of a carefully executed discernment of spirits: it is no less than becoming a pious and truly religious magus, ‘who so far excels other men as he himself is distant from the immortal gods’ (qui tam homines caeteros praecellit quam ipse a diis immortalibus distat)."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Putnik98<UN> religionem (in Freake’s rendering ‘to work by religion’) or utilitas religionis (‘the profit of religion’) that bear particular significance in Agrippa’s encyclopedia of magic.48With this backdrop from the De triplici ratione and with the crucial first sentence of the De occulta philosophia in mind, we are one step away from ascertaining the primacy of the verbal in the latter work. It is indicated by the very position of the magus as delineated in the De occulta philosophia: he or she lives in a world that is a living symbol or image of God49 and is entitled by a special dignification to decipher the divine vestiges encrypted into each and every segment of that world. The magus accomplishes this task through the act of proper reading. It differs from the widespread medieval concept of “reading the book of nature” insofar as it surpasses the level of rational cognizance and entails a sense of active ontological transformation achieved by magical opera-tio.50 This is what Christopher Lehrich calls ‘a magic of logos’ formulating it as ‘a magic bound up with the Incarnation, with the immanent, physical presence of God in the world, which grounds language in the material’.51Lehrich has aptly demonstrated that Agrippan magic is profoundly linguis-tic, that it revolves around the concepts of reading and writing as understood in the framework of a living, hierarchically structured universe permeated by correspondences. It remains to emphasize the exact role of the Logos or Ve r-bum Dei within this framework. With regard to the principle of emanation and the assumption that ‘every inferior is governed by its superior and receives the 48 See Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 414–415 for the former and 402–403 for the latter phrase.49 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 506–507.50 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 509: ‘quanto autem magis quisque seipsum cognoscet, tanto maiorem vim attrahendi consequitur tantoque maiora et mirabiliora operatur ad tan-tamque ascendet perfectionem, quod efficitur filius Dei transformaturque in eandem imagi-nem quae est Deus et cum ipso unitur.’ (Emphasis mine.) A few lines below he adds that this transformation ‘leads to a better condition and a heavenly nature’ (deducens illud in meliorem sortem et coelestem naturam).51 Lehrich, The Language of Demons and Angels, 98. One of the key points of his interpreta-tion is his direct linking of Agrippan magic with the Incarnation of Christ, which serves as the foundation of divine-natural communication. Agrippa dedicates much of the fifth book of his De triplici ratione to expounding this crucial concept. Whereas the other two “books” are to be read per creaturam and per Scripturam, the third and most sublime is read per ipsum Dei filium (Perrone Compagni, Ermetismo e Cristianesimo, 104), that is by the Word of God. This makes Christianity the consummation of all the other ways of knowing God."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"99Agrippa’s Cosmic Ladder<UN>influence of the virtues thereof ’,52 I argue that Agrippa understood the Logos or Verbum Dei as one of the divine qualities that have descended to this world by gradual emanation, represented by the personality of Jesus Christ but not limited to him. If we remember a direct emanational connection between God the Father, described by Agrippa as ‘the first true light’ (prima vera lux) and the physical phenomenon of light sensible by our eyes (visibilis claritas)53 with a whole range of intermediary stages in between, than such a perspective be-comes plausible with regard to the divine quality of Logos as well. One of the particularly interesting variations of Agrippa’s standard trichotomy of God, macrocosm and microcosm is to be found in Chapter 36 of the third book of the De occulta philosophia. This chapter is crucial for understanding Agrippa’s views on the Logos. The author states that the true image of God is his Word and that man’s soul is the image of the Word.54 Having postulated an ontologi-cal duality of man by introducing a curious opposition between animus homi-nis and homo corporeus (literally “embodied man”), he goes on to ascertain that the human soul first had to be ‘sealed by the Word of God’ (verbo Dei sigilla-tum) in order to be “clothed” (induere) with the material body.55 Moreover, not only is the Word of God sealed in man’s soul to be discovered there and utilized for deification, but it is also the ontological basis for every single act of sensible communication in this world:[B]ut every voice of ours, speech and word, unless it be formed by the voice of God, is mingled with the air and vanishes, but the Spirit and Word of the Lord remains, life and sense accompanying it. Therefore all our speech, words, spirit and voice have no power in magic unless they be formed by the divine Word. (...) So also our words can do very many miracles if they be formed by the Word of God.5652 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 85.53 Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 177–178.

That this particular form of communication is made possible by the presence of the emanated Logos is stressed by the following statement: ‘This is the power of the Word formed by the mind and received into a subject rightly disposed’.57 The emphasized words are important as they point to the process of accepting the Word of God: it is achieved by a proper disposition (dispositum rite), just like any other divine quality descended through emanation, as the German humanist keeps repeating throughout his work, especially in the first book.58 In this context his remark that no human language was ‘formed by hap or chance, nor by the weak judgement of men, but from above’ (divinitus)59 acquires a new dimension: to a smaller or larger extent, every human language is an emanation of the Logos. Otherwise it would be utterly incomprehensible, as clearly indicated by Agrippa in the passage quoted above.60From all the above said it follows that, in Agrippa’s perspective, the histori-cal incarnation of Jesus Christ was only a visible symbol of the much more universal concept of Verbum Dei, which permeates the world as the fundamen-tal priciple of communication. It is no wonder then that lingustic issues form the core of the De occulta philosophia. The Verbum Dei thus becomes another qualitas occulta to be recognized and utilized for the magician’s ascent to the realm of the supernatural. Faith in Jesus Christ, so dear to the humanist theo-logian in Agrippa, is thus instrumentalized for the purpose of discovering and deciphering the encrypted presence of the Word of God in the world. Perhaps this is the sense in which one should understand Cornelius Agrippa’s claim that the best magus is a homo Christianus.57 Agrippa, Three Books of Occult Philosophy, 582 (italics mine). ‘Atque haec est potentia verbi a mente formata in subiectum dispositum rite suscepti’ (Agrippa, De occulta phi-losophia, 513). This conclusion follows after a discussion about how Christ, ‘the Word of the Father made flesh’, was the only one to reveal this divine secret.58 See, for instance, Chapter 22 of this book, Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 128–131. Receiv-ing celestial gifts by proper disposition is one of Ficino’s key concepts; see Ficino, Three Books on Life, 242–253. However, he would never go so far as to openly proclaim the Word of God one of these gifts.59 See note 40.60 This point, I believe, refutes one of the main conclusions of Chris Miles’s otherwise me-ticulous analysis, namely that Cornelius Agrippa subscribed to the desperately skeptical attitude toward language; see Chris Miles, ‘Occult Retraction’, 448. Moreover, it is the only appropriate context within which to evaluate Agrippa’s rejection of the Hebrew language as the only language given “from above”; see also Lehrich, The Language of Demons and Angels, 199."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"101Agrippa’s Cosmic Ladder<UN>BibliographyAgrippa, Cornelius, De occulta philosophia libri tres, ed.

In reference to her approach toward Byzantine ritual, text, and art, Pentcheva writes: ‘Within the sphere of the visual [...] “performative” bears the marks of the phenomenal [...] in focusing on the interaction between object and subject, between icon and viewer, between poetry seen and poetry pronounced, I uncover the power of the icon’s spectacle to transform the viewer from observer to participant, communing with the divine’.

Though Pentcheva is dealing primarily with concrete icons and only secondarily with textual images, I maintain that this approach, mutatis mutandis, can also be fruitful in dealing with such image-laden and performative texts as Böhme’s.5 For a deft treatment of Persianate Sufi literature that draws on anthropological, literary, and historical approaches to place text back within an embodied context, see: Bashir, Sufi Bodies.chapter 5Imagining the Image of God: Corporeal Envisioning in the Theosophy of Jacob BöhmeJoshua Levi Ian GentzkeNew hermeneutical strategies are being developed within a growing body of scholarship that treats the role the senses in the production of knowledge and culture.1 Drawing from phenomenology, aesthetics, art theory, anthropology and performance studies, this literature moves toward a more “embodied” ap-proach to the human sciences.2 Its advocates challenge the notion that images are purely representational, and texts essentially propositional, by teasing out the experiential dimensions of both texts3 and artworks.4 Rather than delin-eating the fixed meaning of a textual or graphical image by way of an originary semiotic referent, focus is placed on the experience of an image or concept within its larger historical and hermeneutical horizons.5 While the gains made"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Gentzke104<UN>6789106 A concise (and entertaining) argument for an extra-biological approach to the senses can be found in Bruno Latour’s discussion of malettes á odeurs (odor kits), in: Latour, ‘How to Talk About the Body?’ 205–229.7 By employing the term “aesthetic,” I mean to point toward the way in which much of Böhme’s imagery discloses its content through emotive, rather than discursive strategies; with the term “kinaesthetic,” I mean to draw attention to the way in which this imagery often communicates proprioceptively, i.e., by referencing bodily sensation and spatial orientation.8 That said, Böhme’s theological narrative is not so loose that it cannot be parsed; his theo-logical system has been outlined in several monographs, e.g. Koyré, La Philosophie de Ja-cob Boehme; Deghaye, Naissance de Dieu; Stoudt, Sunrise to Eternity; Weeks, Boehme: An Intellectual Biography; and O’Regan, Gnostic Apocalypse.9 At least as far back as the Romantics, many have professed to find a poet’s sensibility in Böhme’s work precisely because it flies in the face of classical standards of argumentation and expression. Novalis for one maintained: ‘Man sieht durchaus in ihm den gewaltigen Frühling mit seinen quellenden, treibenden, bildenden und mischenden Kräften, die von innen heraus die Welt gebären – ein ächtes Chaos voll dunkler Begier und wunder-baren Leben – einen wahren, auseinandergehenden Microcosmos.’ Novalis, Schriften, iv 322–323.10 Hegel, Lecture on the History of Philosophy, 188–189.by such scholarship are numerous, I would like to keep two points in mind in the following chapter: (i) the growing awareness of the role that cultural—and thus historical—factors have in shaping sensory experience and indeed the senses themselves;6 (ii) the way in which taking nonpropositional content seriously helps complicate analysis that relies entirely on intellectualist or iconographic assumptions. The work of the Christian mystic Jacob Böhme (1575–1624) seems to me to be well suited to such an approach, as it revolves around the relationship between body, image, and imagination. With this in mind, the following chapter explores both the textual and visual performance of the notion of “image” (Bild) in the work of the Christian mystic, Jacob Böhme (1575–1624), throwing into relief both the “aesthetic” and “kinaesthetic” dimensions of Böhme’s theosophy.7With Böhme, who is anything but a systematic writer, it is often difficult to extract the content of a linear narrative from the frequently phantasmagoric form that his expression takes.8 Due to this idiosyncratic style, there are count-less instances of terminological inconsistency in Böhme works and many of his terms appear to be wildly polysemous in nature. For some, such as the German Romantics, who actively sought a counterpoint to classicism, this is part of the allure of Böhme.9 Other less enthusiastic readers, ranging from am-bivalent to dismissive, have described the author’s style as that of a ‘complete barbarian’;10 as reliant upon ‘sensual imagery [...] obscure analogies, and [...]"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"105Imagining the Image of God<UN>1112131411 ‘...sinnlichen Bildern [...] dunkeln Naturanschauungen [...] der willkürlichsten und selt-samsten Hülfsmittel...’. Schwegler, Geschichte der Philosophie im Unriß, 135.12 Brown, The Later Philosophy of Schelling, 64.13 Many of Böhme’s key terms are rooted in previous discourses, such as Paracelsianism, alchemical discourse, Hermeticism, and the German legacy of Christian mysticism. But Böhme’s work is not simply the summation of these influences: many familiar terms and concepts are deployed and radically reinterpreted by the way they are situated within his unique framework. For a good introduction to Böhme’s intellectual debts see: Weeks, 35–59.14 On the most basic level, a ‘semantic field’ is a ‘group of words closely related in meaning, often subsumed under a general term’. Lehrer, Semantic Fields and Lexical Structure, 1. In Böhme’s case the term “image” (Bild), more than merely pointing toward a single referent, opens up a field or “space” of association; image signifies a series of relationships that point towards a larger conceptual whole.the most arbitrary and singular modes of expression’;11 as both ‘primitive and profound’; suited to the expression of ‘a mélange of nonsense and profundity, a mine of fascinating ideas but not a finished piece of metaphysical analysis.’12 These readings are premised upon the idea that Böhme’s mode of expression is only accidental to his content; furthermore, they assume that the content of his work is propositional in nature. However, as I hope will become clear, these are all too hasty presumptions. Regardless of one’s aesthetic assessment, I think it safe to say that a great deal of the visionary’s uniqueness lies as much in his mode of expression as in the ideas he expresses.13 In an attempt to be sensitive to form as well as content, I focus primarily on the interrelation of a series of key terms and the function of these terms within Böhme’s imagistic drama. I turn first to the verbal imagery Böhme employs to present his inter-twined notions of “body” and “image”. I then touch on the ontology of the Böh-mean image, the relational structure between creature and creator supported by this ontology, and Böhme’s notion of the regeneration of the fallen human being. I then discuss two other terms and locate them within the “semantic field”14 opened up by Böhme’s notion of image: “magic” (Magia) and “imagi-nation” (Einbildung, Imagination). In examining these terms, the associative connections Böhme makes between the spatial, corporeal, and visual come to the foreground and, I argue, the structure of what can with equal justification be termed a “corporeal practice of envisioning” or a “practice of corporeal en-visioning” is uncovered. Having analyzed some of the key word-images Böhme employs, I turn to an example of Böhmean performance: examining the tex-tual and visual dimensions of one of the key images of his iconography, the “Philosophical Sphere” (Philosophische Kugel), I show how Böhme attempts to rhetorically perform his twofold notion of image/body in a bid to embody"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Gentzke106<UN>15161715 Böhme compares the churches of stone (Steinerne Kirchen) to a ‘concubine of God’ (Gottes Kebsweiber) who, instead of bringing forth divine progeny, bears ‘illegitimate children’ (huren-Kinder) with the unregenerate clergy.

In closing, I argue that much of the dynamic power of Böhme’s system lies in the fact that it speaks to the reader in both visual and corporeal terms, offer-ing up a new “image/body” for the desiring disciple to inhabit through their imagination. Jacob Böhme’s Drama of the Image: The ScriptThe theosophy of Jacob Böhme envisions and explores a newly delineated sa-cred territory replete with its own temporality. Taking leave of medieval cos-mology, Böhme’s work polemically rejects locating divinity by the coordinates of space and time. His deity does not inhabit the Euclidean space of the heav-ens, nor is his understanding of Christ’s incarnation subject to the distance of chronological history. For Böhme, spirit meets matter within the chiasm of world and body and the occasion of this event is the ever-present moment; the divine is a ubiquitous presence permeating nature, the human body, and the whole of creation.But despite his use of the rhetoric of interiorization, Böhme’s thought is not primarily a form of mystical quietism. Beyond the boundaries of privatized, in-ner revelation, the mystic’s imaginal world intends toward social – and there-fore political – realms. By collapsing the ontological rift between creature, creator, and nature, Böhme challenged the medial privilege of institutional Christianity, the ‘churches of stone’ (die steinere Kirchen)15 that encouraged belief ‘merely in a historical faith’ (blos in einen historischen Glauben).16 Im-plicitly relating himself to Luther, Böhme’s letter correspondences hint that he and his followers would be instrumental in ushering in a new and final ‘Ref-ormation.’17 Böhme’s re-centering of hermeneutical authority on vision and experience was more than a literary conceit: the drama contained in his works was meant to be enacted and to this end, it sought actors."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"107Imagining the Image of God<UN>In this sense, Böhme performs a paradigmatic turn away from institutional-ism alongside fellow post-Reformation religious dissenters.18 And naturally his work must be understood within the context of a larger protestant culture of dissent. But unique to the Böhmean vision is the way in which he attempts to direct this reorientation: his texts dramatically combine, fuse, and orchestrate spatial, corporeal, and visual motifs;19 the theosopher constructs an imaginal drama, urging his readers to participate by assuming imaginal bodies.20I focus on the script of this imaginal drama first, before turning my atten-tion to its performance, i.e., how the notion of image functions semantically in Böhme’s work. To structure my discussion, I’ll reference three linguistic signposts that I group within the same semantic field: image, Magia, and imagination. Image/BodyCorporeality plays a very important role in Böhme’s theosophy. In Forty Ques-tions on the Soul (Vierzig Fragen von der Seelen) Böhme goes so far as to main-tain that the ‘earthly body’ (der irdische Leib) is ‘the Mysterium, in which the most hidden secret lies’ (das Mysterium, darinnen das Arcanum liegt der gros-sen Verborgenheit); in the same text corporeality is also envisioned as a space in which ‘the Deity has manifested itself in earthliness, [i.e.,] in a comprehen-sible entity’ (die Gottheit hat sich mit der Irdigkeit, als im begreiflichen Wesen geoffenbaret).21Böhme’s vision of the body links up in turn with his understanding of the relationship between creature and Creator. By appropriating and subtly trans-posing a theological motif rooted in patristic discourse, Böhme repeatedly invokes Luther’s translation of Genesis 1:27: ‘and God created human beings 1819202118 For a concise introduction to the relationship between dissent and early modern mysti-cism, see Weeks, German Mysticism, 143–168.19 On the connection between vision, hidden knowledge, and space, i.e. “interiority”, see: O’Regan, Gnostic Apocalypse, 28; on the motif of vision in Böhme’s work as a ‘meta-aesthetic’, see: ibid, 27–30; and on Böhme’s theosophy as a ‘religion of speculative vision’, see: ibid., 48–49. On the possible significance of “perspective,” and Baroque perspectival-ism, in Böhme’s work, see: Ibid., 4, 230, f.n. 23.20 I employ the term ‘imaginal’ in a sense that reflects Chiara Bottici’s pragmatist re- envisioning of Henry Corbin’s concept to connote “that which is made of images and can therefore be the product of both of an individual faculty and of the social context as well as of a complex interaction between the two.” Bottici, Imaginal Politics, 5. However, in contradistinction to Bottici, I would like to stress the multi-sensorial, affective dimen-sions that of the imaginal that point beyond the strictly visual.21 Böhme, Viertzig Fragen, iv 96/16:5."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Gentzke108<UN>2223242526272822 Luther, Dr. Martin Luther’s Bibelübersetzung, 1.

In the present paper I translate Wesen alternately as ‘essence’, ‘substance’, and ‘being’ according to context. It is important to note that none of these terms should be understood within the Böhmean context as philosophically ab-stract concepts.26 Most often, Böhme uses the terms Bild and Bildniss. Less frequently, and with a somewhat different valence, he also employs Figur and Gleichniss.27 In this respect, it is interesting to note Faivre’s observation that Böhme often ‘employs “image” and “essence” (Wesen) without distinction to suggest that every image is the es-sence for what it has become the image of ’. Faivre, Theosophy, Imagination, Tradition, 139.28 Böhme, Mysterium Magnum, xvii 6/2: 2.in His image’ (Und Gott schuff den Menschen ihm zum Bilde).22 For Böhme “image” does not signify the platonic notion of icon, i.e., an apparent reality that points back to a higher spiritual one: appositely image points to essential dimensions of material existence. As Deghaye has noted,23 Bild in the German of Böhme’s times could also signify body, i.e., the sensible form of something,24 as well as image. Christ’s twofold role as both image and body of the invisible and intangible Deity only served to strengthen the incarnational connotations of this term. Böhme’s ear was in no way deaf to this semantic overtone: he repeatedly plays with this connotation, interweaving corporeality, image, and essence in his prose. For him, the ‘human body’ (der Leib eines Menschen) is ‘the visible world, an image and essence of all that is in that world’ (die sichtbare Welt, ein Bild und Wesen alles dessen was die Welt ist).25 Ontology of the ImageThe notion of image in Böhme’s work,26 with its optical and corporeal di-mensions, also imposes a relational structure upon the imaginal realm of the visionary. By way of this structure, the idea of imaginal resemblance is inti-mately bound up with ontology, with essence or corporeality in a more general sense.27 In contradistinction to representational image theories, the Böhmean image is essentially synonymous with essence. And human being, by way of Böhme’s reading of Genesis, is presented as the ‘image/body and essence’ (Bilde [...] und Wesen) of the ‘abyssal God’ (des ungründlichen Gottes):28 the material that sheer spirit takes on in order to clothe itself with form.

The interdependence of creature and cre-ator reflects the relationship between mirror, subject, and image: the image manifests the presence of the subject as the subject sustains the essence of the image; each comes to sense the other in and through the other. Thus, the mir-ror is effectively two-way: becoming is portrayed as a dialectical event. How-ever, unlike in German Idealism, this event of knowing/becoming is rooted in a sensual rather than cognitive epistemology. Just as matter depends upon spirit for its animacy, spirit is beholden to matter in order to realize its own subjec-tive being. And this knowledge is portrayed in terms that are at once gustatory and spatial: ‘[e]very spirit without a body is empty, and does not know itself; therefore every spirit desires a body for its food and its habitation’ (Ein jeder Geist ohne Leib ist rohe, und kennet sich nicht: nun begehret ein jeder Geist Leib, beydes zu einer Spiese und zu einer Wonne).30Human being not only gives spirit form: it is through human being that the pure spirit of the deity comes to know itself proprioceptively as it enters into the space of the world through that of the human body.* * *Though human being is ontologically interwoven into the deity through the visual/corporeal bond of the image, Böhme maintains that this relationship is corrupt in our postlapsarian state. The divine image has been obscured.31 For-tunately, regenerates can develop a luminous body rooted in divine light be-neath the veil of their dull earthly flesh.

Their regenerated organs – the eyes of the spirit, the imagination, and the regenerate flesh – open simultaneously upon the “inner-space” of the divine worlds and the “exterior-space” of a newly-inspirited world. The re-mapping of the “inner-space” of the human body is simultaneously presented as a re-mapping of the “outer-space” within which the body is situated: bodies de-termine the worlds that they open onto, and thus the transformative event of regeneration not only “re-spiritualizes” the body, it also resituates it in space. In the second birth ‘no other soul is born’ (keine andere Seele geboren), but rather ‘a new body’ (ein neuer Leib), wherein the soul is able to be ‘renewed’ (renoviret).33 And through the nativity of this new body, regenerates realize their true locality: the reborn body is ‘already in heaven’ (schon im Himmel), for heaven is ‘everywhere, even in the very place where you stand and move’ (allenthalben, auch an dem Orte, wo du stehest und gehest).34* * *In Böhme’s understanding, the second birth reconfigures the corporeal di-mensions of human being into a temple in which ‘God dwells’ (in deme Gott wohnete) and ‘discloses his splendor’ (seine Wunder eröffnen).35 And if the divine image is regenerated within the body, the veil of the earthly body will open to reveal a new image/body, a corporeality consubstantial with the Christbody: ‘as we die in the old earthly body, so we live in the new body, in the body of Jesus Christ’ (also in dem alten irdischen Leibe sterben, so leben wir im neuen Leibe, im Leibe Jesu Christi).36As the material dwelling place of spirit, the regenerate is garbed in the flesh of Christ (Christi Fleisch),37 corporealization of the incorporeal, and ‘the true image of God’ (des wahren Bildness Gottes).38 If this transformation is proper-ly enacted, Böhme maintains, the body of Christ, will ‘become the body’ (Leib worden) of the reborn believer.39 Freed from the realm of space and time, yet"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"111Imagining the Image of God<UN>40414243444546474840 I am grateful to my colleague Kathryn E.

Böhme’s imaginative reinterpre-tation of the incarnation actually inverts the mythic structure of the orthodox, “historical” version without denying its salvific potency: in response to the in-carnation of the divine spirit in flesh, the flesh of human being must now be divinized.40The regenerated image/body is, Böhme insists, nothing less than the sacred space wherein human being and Divine encounter each other; it is the ‘Tab-ernacle of God’ (eine Hütte Gottes seyn den Menschen).41 In the regenerate state, Christ’s body – now our body – ‘will be our temple’ (und Christi Leib wird unser Tempel seyn), the ‘New Jerusalem, of which the Prophet Ezekiel writes’ (der Tempel, das neue Jerusalem, davon Ezechiel der Prophet schreibet).42 Thus, it is the inner architecture of the body43 that provides the imaginal space in which the ‘cold and half-dead body’ (kalte und halb-todte Leib)44 is transmuted into ‘divine flesh’ (Göttlich Fleisch).45 Rather than the walls of the stone churches (die Steinerne Kirchen), the flesh of each believer will house the holy.But flesh is not the only aspect of divine anatomy that can be fused with human physiology: a regenerated body enjoys a regenerated vision. Inhabit-ing the Christbody, the regenerate is able to see with christic eyes: ‘the eyes of the soul-image/body’ (der Seelen-Bildniss Augen).46 And this ‘spiritual see-ing’ (geistlichen Sehen), in which ‘the spirit of Christ sees through and in us’ (Der Geist Christi siehet durch und in uns),47 allows for an understanding of things outside the purview of ratiocination, e.g., the ‘Angelic World’ (Englische Welt) and even the Divine itself.48 But this visionary knowing is not merely a process by way of which human beings come to divine knowledge.

Like Böhme, the work of Para-celsus revolves around ‘the term or family of terms for image (bilt, biltnus, einbildung, form, gestalt, figur, and more)’. Weeks, Paracelsus: Speculative Theory and the Crisis of the Early Reformation, 111. Also in concord with Böhme, the Paracelsian image is ‘the root of a magically engendering imagination and the biblical measure of the likeness of divine and human natures’. Ibid., 111.52 In the Timaeus, χώρα appears as a third type of phenomena ontologically situated be-tween insubstantial being and creation. Plato, Timaeus 45/52a., passim.53 Böhme, Von sechs mystischer Puncten, v 93/5:4.of this visionary cognition is not discontinuous from the seeing subject; per-ception gives way to proprioception and tactility: sensory modes that blur the categories of subject and object, knower and known. As humans gain divine knowledge, God is afforded self-knowledge through the senses of the inspirit-ed human being. Human being is ‘a nothingness’ (ein Nichts) whose ‘knowing’ (Wissen) and ‘seeing’ (Sehen) are ‘God himself ’ (Er selber).49 MagiaThe act of reoccupying the divine “image/body” is, for the theosopher, an ex-plicitly magical one. Magic (Magia) is the force that enables the transformation of one essence into another, allowing all humans to participate in the Chris-tian mysteries of creation, death and resurrection through the imagination. And in Böhme’s system, wherein the notion of regenerative transformation is paramount, magic is portrayed as nothing less than a salvational technol-ogy. Böhme insists, contrary to the teachings of institutionalized Christianity: ‘magic is the best theology because in her true faith is found and grounded’ (Magia ist die beste Theologia, denn in ihr wird der wahre Glaube gegründet und gefunden).50Though the word Magia comes down to Böhme loaded with layers of meaning – Paracelsus von Hohenheim (1493–1541) is particularly influential upon him in this regard51 – what he means to signify by his rather idiosyncratic use of this term can be grasped by paying close attention to his own attempts to circumscribe its meaning. At times Böhme seems to present Magia as a quasi-entity, a force personified both linguistically and mythologically as feminine, bearing more than a passing resemblance to Plato’s notion of χώρα [chōra].52 She is a ‘matrix without substantiality’ (eine unsubstantialische Matrix), who mediates between the worlds of insubstantial spirit and materiality by para-doxically ‘revealing herself in substance’ (offenbaret sich aber im Wesen).53 Though she is ‘a spirit’ (Geist), Magia embodies herself through ‘substance’"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"113Imagining the Image of God<UN>545556575859606154 Ibid., v 93/5:5.55 Ibid., v 93/5.1.56 Ibid., v 93/5.1.57 Böhme, Mysterium Magnum, xvii 69–70/11: 9.58 Böhme, Kurtze Erklärung von sechs mystischen Puncten, vii 94/5.10.59 Ibid., vii 93/5.4.60 Ibid., vii 94/5.12-13: ‘Magia dienet den Gottliebendenin Gottes Wesen, denn Sie machet im Verstande Göttlich Wesen, und nimmt das aus der Imagination [...] Sie ists, die Göt-tlich Fleisch machet’.61 ‘Dann die Drey-Zahl ist nu rein Geist im Wesen, und ist doch auch kein Wesen ohne die Drey-Zahl: dann die Begierde der Drey-Zahl ist die ewige Magia und machete Wesen; (Wesen), which in turn serves as ‘her body’ (ihr Leib).54 Unfolding within these dimensions, she is both a force and a liminal space that partakes equally of op-posing ontological principles and expresses herself through a panoply of shift-ing images. Magia is also a primary, creative ontological principle: ‘the Mother of Eternity’ (die Mutter Ewigkeit), and of ‘the essence of all beings’ (Wesens aller Wesen); as such ‘she is self-creating’ (sie machet sich selber).55As befits such a liminal entity, Böhme maintains that Magia cannot be en-visioned through intellection; rather he evokes the language of erotic, bodily being. The reader is entreated to engage in a sort of corporeal envisioning in order to grasp the sense of Böhme’s textual evocation of magic. Magia can only be ‘understood in desire’ (in der Begierde verstanden),56 because strong desire (starke Beigerde) is her essence or ‘ground’ (Grund).57 It is desire, ‘rough and arid like a hunger’, (rauh und dürre, als ein Hunger) which ‘drives the abyss into ground and the nothing into a something’ (führet die den Abgrund in Grund, und das Nichts in Etwas);58 ‘[T]rue Magic’ (rechte Magia), though she is a cre-ative force that fosters the coming-into-being of all essence, is herself ‘not a being, but rather the desiring spirit of being’ (kein Wesen, sondern der begeh-rende Geist des Wesens).59Accordingly, it is through the womb of magic, impregnated with desire, that imagination can envision, and thus re-image, the body as divine: ‘Magia serves those who love God in his essence, for she makes in our mind divine essence/substance, and takes this [essence] from imagination [...] it is she who makes divine flesh’.60Magia thus mediates between the subjective realm of the inner existence and the outside world; characterized in terms of lack—as a desire at the heart of the cosmic Trinity61—Magia is the “enabling condition” that allows human desire to move into image and concretize itself as flesh and substance."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Gentzke114<UN>62636465666768sie fuhret in Grund ein, nach dem Model so der Geist in der Weisheit eroffnet, aus ihr ist die Schöpfung ergangen, nach dem Model im Spigel der Jungfräulichen Weisheit.’ (40 Fragen, 33/I: 118.)62 This term, comprised of ‘ground’ (Grund) and the negating prefix ‘un’, seems to be Böhme’s own coinage. To borrow a notion from Michael Sells’ work on Medieval mysti-cism, Ungrund can be read as an attempt to “unsay” the object-god of a physicalist no-tion of ontology. See: Sells, Mystical Languages of Unsaying. As such this term performs and preserves the mystery at the heart of Böhme’s theosophy. The term first surfaces in Böhme’s Viertzig Fragen von der Seele (1620), but was proceeded by his use of the adjective ungründlich in earlier works.

ImaginationIn what follows, I tease out some of the visual and corporeal significances implicit in Böhme’s notions of the creative, viz., generative, imagination. But before doing so, it will be necessary to briefly confront Böhme’s notion of Ungrund.Böhme’s magical drama of envisioning and embodying is also played out on a cosmological level. Indeed, the entire movement of primordial nothingness into the plurality and delineation of material and fleshly being is expressed through a cascade of imagery that connects vision to the process of corporeal spatialization.The pre-ontological emptiness, the Ungrund62 – described as a ‘mirror’ (Spiegel),63 ‘a brightness’ (ein heller Glast),64 an ‘eternal eye without essence’, (ein ewigen Auge ohne Wesen),65 and ‘an eternal nothing’ (ein ewig Nichts)66 – enters simultaneously into sensual self-knowledge and substantial being, driv-en from within by a raging, stinging desire and directed by a boundless will that ‘comprehends the eye or the mirror’ (das Auge fasset als den Spiegel).67In this act of self-comprehension, the Ungrund passes ‘out of ungrounded-ness into a ground’ (aus dem Ungrunde im dem Grund)68 in an act of optic incarnation and theogonic pregnancy. Böhme explains: ‘[E]very desire is magnetic, though in the Ungrund there is nothing that can be drawn; so de-sire begets itself, and impregnates the [...] will of the Father, which imaginates"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"115Imagining the Image of God<UN>697071727369 Ibid., vi 9/1. 31–32: ‘ein iedes Begehren anziehende sey, wiewol im Ungrunde nichts ist, das da könte gezogen werden; so zeucht sich aber das Begehren selber, und schwängert den [...] Willen des Vaters, welcher zum Lichte der Majestät, aus dem Centro seines Worts oder Herzens imaginiret. Jetzt ist das Herze des Lichts schwanger.’70 ‘So dann nun ein Wille ist, der das Auge ist, der das Auge hält, so ist das Halten ein Begeh-ren, nemlich des Auges: so ist das Begehren ins Auge einziehend, und da doch nichts ist als das Auge, un seucht sich das Begehren nur selber un Auge, und schwängert das Auge mit dem Ungezogenen, dass es voll ist, und ist doch auch nichts als eine Finsterniss des frenen Auges’. Böhme, Viertzig Fragen von der Seelen, iv 12/1.22.71 In Böhme’s cosmology, desire is the originary ontological force; substance (Wesen) is the ultimate telos. Divine desire is presented as the first step toward manifestation and cor-poreality: ‘the desire of the eternal Word, which is God, is the beginning of eternal nature, and is the concretizing of the eternal nothing into something’ (die Begierde des ewigen Worts, welches GOtt ist, ist der Anfang der ewigen Natur, und ist die Fassung des ewigen Nichts in Etwas). Böhme, Mysterium Magnum, xvii 32–33/6.14.72 On a divine level, there is an Eternal Imagination, differentiated from the imperfect imag-ination of human being. The former is able to create imperishable things, the latter only what is impermanent. Ibid., vi 21/1. 23.73 It is interesting to note that, by way of refusing to fully privatize the imagination, Böhme prefigures thinkers such as Cornelius Castoriadis who theorized the collective dimen-sions of the imaginations. For example, see: Castoriadis, “Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads,” 71–90. toward the light of majesty from the center of His word or heart. [And] now the heart of the light is pregnant’.69The abyssal eye (Auge) that envisions/desires itself into its own depths is thus ‘impregnated’ (schwängert) by its own desire for that which it sees/sens-es: its own substantial being.70 Thus the origin of being is imagined erotically; nothingness moves into somethingness through desiring and magically re-imag(in)ing itself as a being.71Böhme’s theogonic drama implies that the substantive world, in its endless state of becoming, is a process of imaging occurring within the ‘Eternal Imagi-nation’ (ewigen Imagination)72 of a divine nothingness. In this sense, imagi-nation is presented as both a faculty and a horizon or realm.73 This creative performance is mirrored in the human subject as well. Human being is simul-taneously image (active double of God), imaginer (co-creator, possessor of the faculty of imagination), and imagined (existing within an imaginal economy). Whether transposed into a cosmic or psychological key, imagination actualizes the magic of desire; it moves spirit toward essence and essence toward spirit. In doing so, imagination reveals its ontological function. As the active form of the image, imagination provides the flesh of being.Imagination is also the medium through which the triunity of world, hu-man being, and Divine shifts and transforms.

Prior to rebirth, human beings do not possess ‘the pure element’ (das reine Element), i.e., the divine image, ‘for a body’ (zu einem Leibe) as the primordial, androgynous Adam did.74 Having been spiri-tually de-formed through the fall, humanity must be re-imaged, imaginally restored by being reborn within a “power-body” (Kraftleib).75 And in order to achieve this, Böhme maintains that the seeking soul must enter into the divine alchemical furnace, the heart of the eternal fire (ewigen Feuers) – a principle ‘we can only reach in the imagination’ (welches wir nicht erreichen, als nur in der Imagination).76 By entering into the fire of the imagination, Böhme assures his readership: ‘human being has the power to lead life out of death and bring it into the divine essence’.77 As a faculty, the imagination allows for incarnation within a limitless body;78 as a horizon, it signifies the abyssal plenitude of an eternal beginning.* * *As we have seen, in order to convey the hidden, spiritual dimensions of being, Böhme seeks out word-images that speak in aesthetic and kinaesthetic tones to resonate with the secret, sensual language of the body. This is not surpris-ing, given the theosopher’s understanding of the interconnectedness of flesh and spirit: ‘I understand flesh and spirit in one essence, [for there is] no spirit without flesh and blood’.79With this in mind, I would maintain that Böhme’s mode of expression is consonant with his conceptual framework: understanding the visual imagina-tion, both in its psychological and cosmic modalities, to be incarnational rath-er than representational, he perpetually implies ontological slippage between"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"117Imagining the Image of God<UN>808182838480 Böhme, Von der Drey Principien, ii 376/22.19.81 Böhme, Mysterium Magnum, xvii 744/68.5.82 Böhme, Von der Menschwerdung Jesu Christi, v 88/11.8.83 Böhme, Von sechs mystischer Puncten, v 95/5.23.84 Böhme, Von der Menschwerdung Jesu Christi, v 88/11.8.image, body, and essence while connecting salvation to the production of di-vine flesh by way of the imagination. At the center of his drama of the image is an attempt to re-imagine and thus reimage the body as ‘the true image of God’ (die rechte Bildniss Gottes).80 Making full use of the logic of likeness encoded within the formula “made in the image of ”, Böhme maintains that a different type of relationship with the Deity can be obtained through reassuming a di-vine image-body.There are also socio-political implications to this drama. In the new state of embodiment, Christians have no need for the mediation of the institutional church and its ‘historical faith’ (einen historischen Glauben);81 rather they en-joy direct access to divinity through their regenerated senses. For Böhme ‘the word faith is not historical’ (das Wort Glaubens ist nicht historisch),82 but is ‘grounded and located’ (gegründet und gefunden) in Magia.83 Authentic piety, the theosopher argues, is not based merely on second-hand, “historical” knowl-edge nor found through theological erudition: true faith necessitates experien-tial, sensual knowledge of the divine mysteries. It is the innate capability of the magical imagination, here figured as Magia, rather than the rites or teach-ings of the church, which holds the salvific power of transformation. Böhme reimagines imagination as a locus of authority. And by making this move, he effectively short-circuits any institutional claims to spiritual sovereignty. The new body fashioned by the magical imagination, is sensually conjoined with the deity; the reborn Christian puts on ‘God’s essence [...] as a body’ (Gottes Wesen [...] als ein Leib)84 and the existential rift between Deity and human being is spanned by this assumption of divinized flesh. Böhme’s Drama of the Image: The PerformanceViewed from within the context of such an imagocentric world, the very pro-duction of imagery takes on meanings that exceed the logic of representa-tional referentiality.

In particular, I mean to highlight: (a) the fact that Böhme seems to understand his project more in terms of ergon than logos, i.e., he is speaking of preparing oneself to be “worked on” by a divine entity, not theologizing sensu strictu and (b) that the desired result of this visualization is nothing less than the divinization of the envisioner.86 The majority of these visual works have been printed together, along with the requisite historical information by the German art historian Christoph Geissmar.

Images, understood by way of Böhme’s incarnational hermeneutics, are both the sign and essence of that to which they bear witness.By paying attention to how Böhme attempts to reproduce his images within the imagination of his readers through harnessing their desire, the scholar is afforded a glimpse of the “practical expression” of Böhme’s Magia: not just what Böhme’s system says, but how it was meant to work. Thus, having dealt with the “scripted” end of Böhme’s imagistic drama, I now turn to an example of how Böhme performatively communicates the theosophic connection be-tween image and body, envisioning and incarnating, through the very medium of the “image/body” (Bild). Die Philosophische KugelAlmost immediately after Böhme’s death, a rich iconography began to develop around his work, expressed through a wealth of engravings and illustrations.86 At the center of this iconography is a recurrent image, ‘the Philosophical Sphere’ (die Philosophische Kugel, Fig. 5.1). According to Böhme’s biographer and sometime student, Abraham von Franckenberg (1592–1652), the Philo-sophical Sphere was elaborated by Böhme, both verbally and graphically, dur-ing one of Böhme’s dialogues with the mystically-inclined Medicus Chymicus, Dr. Balthasar Walter (1558–1630).87 In print, however, the textual dimensions of this seminal image are first introduced in Böhme’s Forty Questions on the Soul (Viertzig Fragen von der Der Seelen),88 the same work quoted above which"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"119Imagining the Image of God<UN>Figure 5.1 The Philosophical Sphere, in Jacob Böhme, Viertzig Fragen von der Seelen (1620)898989 This image can be found as an insert in Viertzig Fragen, between iv 30–31; Vol. 3 S.mtliche Schriften. 11 vols, edited by Will-Erich Peukert and August Faust, Stuttgart: Frommanns Verlag 1955–61.

Mahnke, Unendliche Sphäre und Allmittelpunkt, 13.97 Ibid., 38. reveals the human body as ‘the great mystery’; the graphic dimensions ap-peared originally in a 1632 edition of Böhme’s work.90Aside from designating this image as a philosophical sphere, Böhme refers to it as the ‘eye of eternity’ (Auge der Ewigkeit), the ‘mirror of wisdom’ (Spiegel der Weisheit), and the eye of the ‘Being of all Beings’ (Wesen aller Wesen).91 Read on the most basic level, this symbol expresses Böhme’s concept of the two eternal worlds (ewige Principia),92 the ‘Dark-World’ (Finstern Welt) and the ‘Light-world’ (Licht-Welt),93 signified respectively as principia. These pri-mary worlds express themselves through the third principle of the realm of spatial/temporal being: the nexus at which they overlap and in which spirit manifests through essence, figured here as a heart. Correspondingly, it repre-sents Böhme’s medial vision of human being, who ‘grows in the in the middle-world’ (wächset [...] in der mitteln Welt).94 In this sense, the Philosophical Sphere can be seen as a sort of “photograph” of both cosmic reality and the spiritual interior of human being.Historically, the sphere links Böhme to a long tradition of geometrical mys-ticism stretching back to Greek thinkers such as Parmenides (fifth c. bce).95 However, the organic and kinaesthetic nature of Böhme’s vision overflows the boundaries of purely geometric symbolism;96 the cobbler-turned-mystic’s re-enactment of this tradition is uniquely his own. As Mahnke in his monograph Unendliche Sphäre und Allmittelpunkt points out, Böhme’s spherical imagery is rooted in an ‘vital dynamic’ (lebendigen Dynamic), which must be brought into motion by the imagination of the reader/viewer.97 And indeed the very manner"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"121Imagining the Image of God<UN>989910010198 The latter half of the first part of Viertzig Fragen consists of Böhme unpacking the num-bers and terms inscribed within the Kugel in order explicate key points of his thought; what I am interested however is how he attempts to draw the reader into his imaginary in a performative, participatory sense.99 Böhme, Viertzig Fragen von der Seelen, iv 30/1.105: ‘gehe mit ihm aus dem Grimme in das Suchen, durch den Tod in das andere halbe Auge als in das andere Principium’.100 Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being, 119.101 ‘Dieser Circkel solte gleich einer runden Kugel sehn, da das + durchginge (+) [sic]: dann es ist ein Auge der Ewigkeit, das man nicht mahlen kann, es ist das Auge des Wesens aller Wesen, bedeutend das Auge Gottes, welches ist der Spiegel der Weisheit, da von in which this image is presented to the reader/viewer helps animate what could otherwise appear as a merely static representation of a trichotomous on-tology by attempting to incorporate the reader/viewer into the performance. With this in mind, rather than approaching this image iconographically,98 I focus hereafter on the rhetorical and performative dimensions of this image within the context of Böhme’s thoughtworld.Marking the beginning of the performance of the “eye–sphere–mirror sym-bol”, Böhme adopts the imperative voice. Directly addressing his readers, en-treating them, step by step, to imaginally reproduce the symbol he is about to expound, Böhme instructs his audience to ‘take the spirit who is born in fire’ (nim den Geist, der im Feuer erboren wird) and ‘go with him out of the anxiety into the seeking, through death, to the other half of the eye, into the other Principium’, i.e. the ‘light-world’ of self-resignation.99 Desire—here imaged as a fire-spirit—must be coerced into desiring its own death; it is the vehicle of lib-eration from itself. Only through this imaginal journey, he contends, can enter into the existential space of luminosity.The verbal performance continues, enlisting the force of a traditional eso-teric dynamic to animate its content. Elliot R. Wolfson has referred to such practices, which are ‘rooted in the noetic interplay of the apophatic and kata-phatic’, as ‘mystical envisioning’, i.e., the ‘paradoxical imaging of the image of what has no image’.100 And indeed, in this exercise, the tension between the said and the unsaid sounds more loudly than the discursive content of the words. Böhme writes:This circle should be envisioned as a round sphere, through which the + runs (+) [sic]: because it is the Eye of Eternity, which one cannot portray (das man nicht mahlen kann), it is the Eye of the Being of all Be-ings, by which is meant the Eye of God, which is the Mirror of Wisdom, within which for eternity all wonders have arisen.101"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Gentzke122<UN>102103104105106 Ewigkeit sind alle Wunder inne erstehen worden.’ Böhme, Viertzig Fragen von der Seelen, iv 31/1.106.102 Mahlen is an archaic spelling of malen: a term most commonly used to refer to painting, or graphic imaging. However, in a more poetic or metaphorical sense, malen can mean to linguistically depict something through verbal imaging.103 As Weeks suggestively writes: ‘the author is openly conjuring with his symbols.’ Weeks, Boehme, 147.104 Böhme, Viertzig Fragen von der Seelen, iv 31/1.107.105 Ibid., iv 31/1.107.106 Ibid., iv 31/1.107.It may be worth noting that the term “mahlen” can refer to textual, graphical, or verbal modes of representation,102 all of which, I would contend, are rel-evant here.In what follows, the magical dimensions of this imaginal performance move increasingly to the foreground.103 Böhme makes it abundantly clear that the sphere should not merely be understood in a static, representational, or two-dimensional sense. The hinge between the text and the image cannot be greased by intellection alone. In Böhme’s understanding, spirit must manifest within the “space” of the hermeneutic circle that opens between seeker and symbol, interpreter and interpreted.The theosopher maintains that, only those who are ‘able to wander in the di-vine mysteries’ (der im Göttlichen Mysterie wandeln mag) will perceive the ac-tual dimensions of the sphere.104 What the initiate must grasp is ‘not the form that can be written or drawn’, but rather its qualitative reality, the ‘sense’ (Sinn) of image; doing so necessitates adopting a mode of perception premised, not upon ‘abstract intellection or reason’ (Kunst oder Vernunft), but rather ‘under-standing’ (Verstand), which ‘the spirit of God opens in great mystery (Myste-rio) within the human soul-spirit’ (Seelen-Geist).105 Thus, Böhme attempts to communicate the meaning of the Philosophical Sphere through both aesthetic and kinaesthetic means. His language shifts between visual and spatial meta-phors. The reader/viewer is urged to engage with the image first through sight and then, through an imaginary process of embodiment, through propriocep-tion. Böhme endeavors to utilize both the visual and bodily imaginations of his readers to move their imaginal bodies into and through his world of im-ages. And from a Böhmean perspective, this implies that envisioners would simultaneously “incarnate” this world within the “space” of their imaginations: Böhme’s language continuously transgresses the logic of Euclidean space, of internality and externality, locating the subject within the image it internally imagines. The Kugel, he assures his audience, ‘may be apprehended in no other way’ (anderst mags nicht ergriffen werden).106"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"123Imagining the Image of God<UN>107108109110111107 Faivre uses the term “inspirited hermeneuts” to refer to Böhme and his lineage. Though I am not sure if he intends the theurgical connotations of this term, I think they are quite appropriate. Faivre, Theosophy, Imagination, Tradition, 137.108 Böhme, Von sechs theosophische Puncten, vi 38/3.23.109 Böhme, Viertzig Fragen von der Seelen, iv 31/1.105.110 Ibid., iv 46/1.183.111 ‘Sie ist eine ganze Figur des Creutzes, und gleichet sich einem Creutz-Baume nach der äussere Bildniß des Leibes, da der Leib zwey Arme hat, bedeuten zwey Principia, da der Leib in Mitten stehet, als die ganze Person; das Herz ist das erste Principium; das Hirn das ander Principium. Das Herz hat Seele, das Hirn der Seelen Geist.’ Ibid., iv 46 1. 187.It is here that the theurgical nature of this visionary exercise comes to the fore: spirit is drawn into matter in order to enter into sensible presence. In this case, the matter is the body of the ‘in-spirited hermeneut’;107 the spirit is the invisible dimension of Böhme’s imagined sphere. In order for the two eternal principals to symptomatically manifest within the spatiotemporal dimensions of the mundane realm, the ‘middle-world’ (mitteln Welt),108 the reader/viewer must supply this third space. Depicted are the two eternal principles or worlds, that of dark fire and that of light. However, Böhme maintains, ‘the third prin-ciple/world’ (das dritte)—that of the mixed world of substance—must ‘also clearly be understood within the image’ (darinnen klar verstanden wird),109 for the reader should ‘consider’ (nachsinnen) that the figure holds the ‘under-standing of all three worlds’ (den Verstand aller drey Welten), of the ‘two king-doms in one’ (zwey Reiche in einem); it is imperative that the reader ‘behold themselves within the image’ (Besiehe such darinnen).110The nature of this third space becomes clear as Böhme continues, revers-ing the relationship between viewer and viewed. The cross—glossed in the quote above as the eye that cannot be portrayed is revealed as the human ‘soul’ (Seele)—subjectivity itself. As the mediation continues, it becomes clear that, in order to comprehend the image, the viewer, Rather than looking at the im-age, must be repositioned as looking out from within the image. The diagram of the two worlds reorganizes the embodied subject, but it is the body itself that completing the figure and actualizes its imaginal dimensions:The soul is the whole figure of the cross. And according to the image of the body (Bildniß des Leibes), it resembles a cross-tree (Creutz-Baum); the body’s two arms signify two principles, and the body stands in the midst, as a whole person. The heart is the first principle, and the mind the sec-ond; the heart has the soul, and the mind the spirit of the soul.111"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Gentzke124<UN>112113112 ‘Man kanns gar nicht entwerfen mit keinem Mahlen, dass es ist also in einander, es ist ein Eins, und doch zwey [...] und wer nicht in die Wiedegehurt durch den Tod aufs Creutz eingehet, als in Gottes Leib, der verstehet dieses nicht [...] dann diese Figur hat allen Grund [...] und ist dem Leser ohne rechte Augen nicht kennlich, man kanns auch mit Worten in keine rechte Ordung setzen, dann das Este ist auch das Lezte, und das Mittel gehet durch alles, and wird doch nicht erkannt al in sich selber: darum ist Forschen nicht das Vornehmste, zu erkennen Mysterium, sondern in Gott erboren werden ist das rechte finden: dann ausser de mist Babel.’ Ibid., iv 47–48/1. 194.113 Ibid., iv 31/1.107.In this sense, the reader must not only become a viewer, but ultimately come to understand through assuming the very body that the image organizes; to grasp the image calls not only for a transformed vision, but also, a new mode of embodiment. This is the only way to surpass a purely abstract knowledge based on linear temporality and subject-object division—fallen modes of communication associated with the biblical tower of babel:One cannot represent [the image] with any depiction, because the halves [...] are one and yet two [...] whosoever does not enter into rebirth through the death of the cross, which is to say, into the divine body cannot under-stand this [...] because this figure contains the whole ground [...] and the reader cannot know it without true eyes; words cannot be set according to its right order, for the first is also the last, and the middlemost goes through all, and is not known but in itself; therefore intellectual grap-pling (Forschung) is not the best way to find the mystery: but to be born in God is the right way to find it; for without that all is but Babel.112Therefore, the dimension ‘that one cannot portray’ (das man nicht mahlen kann),113 exceeds the plane of the paper – in both the textual and graphical versions of the sphere – and invades the space of the audience. For, if the read-er/viewer is truly to see the Kugel, they must supply the third dimension and complete the absence of the depicted figure; they must become the object of knowledge. By supplying this third, medial space in which the other two spiri-tual worlds manifest, the “fourth wall” of the performance is effectively broken down and the audience effectively thrust into the drama.Böhme’s insistence that the three worlds shown as two are in fact one, i.e., a perfect sphere, compels the attentive reader/viewer to re-enact the reuni-fication of the three worlds in their imagination. It also highlights the unity between seer and seen in the moment where visual perception gives way to inner proprioception.

It is often translated as “mind”, but I feel this misleads the modern reader by associating the term with purely mental ac-tivity. I have chosen “consciousness” in the present context, but a valid translation might also be, as Steven Konopacki has argued: ‘senses, mood, inclination.’ Konopacki, Descent into Words, 54.115 ‘Mein geliebter Herr und Freund [...] euer Gemüthe ist unser Mysterium.’ Ibid., iv 53/1.229.116 Böhme, Von der Menschwerdung v 88/11.8.status, is a potentially transformative event—an act of self-organization. As Böhme reveals to his reader: ‘my dear sir and friend [...] your own conscious-ness (Gemüthe)114 is our Mysterium.’115Therefore this enactment of visual incorporation, of imaginally ingesting Böhme’s visionary world, can, I submit, be understood as a theurgical rite that unfolds within the shared “space” between the reader/viewer and the text/image. The corporeal imagination is engaged and the kinaesthetic and magical dimensions of the image are brought into play. This interpretation accords with Böhme’s contention that ‘faith’ (Glauben) is ‘the eating of God’s essence, the introducing of God’s essence by the imagination into the fire of one’s soul’ (aus Gottes Wesen essen, Gottes Wesen mit der Imagination in sein Seelen-Feuer einführung), whereby the pious are able to ‘put on God’s nature not as a garment, but as a body’ (Gottes Wesen anziehen, nicht als ein Kleid, sondern als einen Leib).116 As spirit meets matter, the figure is envisioned, ingested and then embodied, taking on the holistic dimensions of a sphere. Conclusion: Magically Re-Imag(in)ing the Image/BodyIf approached from within the context of Böhmean logic, images, whether textual or visual, enjoy a status different from that of representations or in-tellectual concepts. Within Böhme’s sacred economy, the notion of “image” brings together the spatial, visual, and corporeal; it points towards what could be described with equal justification as a “practice of corporeal envisioning” or a “corporeal practice of envisioning”. Understanding Böhme’s unique concep-tion of “image” provides the attentive reader with a clue, not only to what this term signifies conceptually, but also, to the way in which images were imag-ined to function within the hermeneutical structure of the Böhmean text. And insofar as the socio-political implications of this notion have been noted, this understanding also points outside of the text toward the historical context in which his work emerged."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Gentzke126<UN>117117 Böhme, Von den drey Principien, ii 388–389/22. 72. The Deutsche Wörterbuch notes that empfindlich is synonymous with sensibilis, as well as percipibilis; thus this term can con-note both haptic and visual modes of knowing. The fact that Böhme contrasts empfind-lich with unsichtlich, seems to argue that he means to stress the former connotation. Das Deutsche Wörterbuch von Jacob Grimm und Wilhelm Grimm. http://www.woerterbuch netz.de/DWB/wbgui_py (last accessed 12.08.11).In this sense, Böhme’s imagery can be understood as layers of imaginal flesh, generated out of the creative, insubstantial womb of a magical imagination and animated by human desire. More than mere intellectual concepts, the no-tions of image, Magia, imagination, and desire, make up a “performative rheto-ric”. Through the deployment of this rhetoric, Böhme sought to incorporate the reader into the world of the text, and concomitantly: the text into the world of the reader.It is therefore through performative, rather than discursive means, that Böhme exploited the semantic overtone sounded in the term Bild, which con-nects image to body. What is effectively on offer is an imaginal body or “image/body,” which would simultaneously allow desirous readers access to, and in-corporate them within, the world that Böhme’s texts map. But though Böhme’s thought revolves explicitly around the notions of the imagination, this should not be taken as evidence that it is, at root, a form of merely speculative qui-etism: Böhme’s esotericizing and imagocentric reinterpretation of Christian-ity was part and parcel of his attempt to dislodge it from the power structures of the church and reincorporate religiosity within the individual bodies that made up the collective social body of the faithful who were offered access to an anatomy replete with senses able to apprehend the supersensible. Böhme’s mythic inversion of the incarnation thus points to the divine potential of the human body. Because of this potential, Böhme maintains, institutional media-tion is no longer necessary; in this sense, any exclusive claim to authority on the part of the church and its representatives is effectively short circuited. Daring to bring the deity within reach of the laity, he informs his readers: ‘the Deity is incomprehensible, and invisible, yet sensually perceptible’ (Der Gottheit ist un-fasslich und unsichtlich, aber empfindlich).117 Böhme offers, not only new eyes through which to see, but with them—a virtual body through which to sense.BibliographyBöhme, Jacob, Sämtliche Schriften. 11 vols, edited by Will-Erich Peukert and August Faust, Stuttgart: Frommanns Verlag 1955–61.

Careful scholars have therefore drawn a distinction. Frances Yates notes that ‘it ranks almost as a third Rosicrucian manifesto’ but is more ac-curately ‘the third item in the series which launched the Rosicrucian furore.’2 Adam McLean remarks that, while ‘often looked upon as the third Rosicru-cian manifesto, [it] has an entirely different tone from the other Rosicrucian documents and addresses itself to inner transformation rather than the outer transformation of society and religion heralded in the Fama and Confessio’.3 Yates prefers to think of it as a ‘romance, or novel, or fantasy’, and it is all of these and more. I have argued that the author, Johann Valentin Andreae, re-garded it as a satire (German Posse or Spott; Latin ludibrium), and particularly as the sort of intellectual jeu d’esprit called Menippean satire.4 In the present essay, I shall argue that Andreae’s satire exploits the narrative conventions of the traveler’s tale and especially the dream vision, which often involves travel to unlikely, even unworldly places. Indeed, I shall suggest that the narrator’s ef-forts to record and interpret his own dreams enable the careful reader to make proper sense of his story, including its symbolism, the underlying allegory, and the abrupt ending.Moreover, when we read The Chemical Wedding as a satiric dream vision, we are better able to see how it comments on the Fama and Confessio and to what extent any of the foundational Rosicrucian documents is a manifesto in the word’s usual sense. The first two works left unanswered questions about the Rosicrucians’ esoteric knowledge, specifically about their take on alchemy. They also raised the question of how an interested reader could be initiated into that esoteric knowledge. The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz 1 See, e.g., Nataf, The Occult, 78.

Through his clever mixture of learned satire, dream vision, and esoteric symbolism, Andreae creates a conjunction or transmuta-tion that rewards the reader who follows the path of his eponymous narrator.1 The Interpretation of Dreams and VisionsThe dream vision, or visio, was among the most popular forms in medieval and early modern poetry.5 However, the dream is so basic to storytelling that ex-amples can be found from literature of almost every culture and era.6 Typically, the narrator falls asleep at a time of stress, as does William Langland’s Piers in The Vision of Piers Plowman, and has a ‘marvelous dream’ that somehow speaks to his condition.7 Or perhaps he dreams of someone very like himself, as Bun-yan dreams of a pilgrim with a book and a burden, that is, the Christian Bible and the full weight of sin. Sometimes the protagonist has a near-death experi-ence, like the Irish knight Trugdalus (Tundale in the English poem) who is met by an angel and guided through the afterlife. Sometimes, as with Dante’s pil-grim, he only hints that he is ‘full of sleep’ (pien de sonno).8 Sometimes, again, he has been awake and, as with Boethius, only says he was ‘silently thinking’ (tacitus...reputarem) while at work on a poem about his condition.9 The alche-mist George Ripley writes:When busie at my booke I was upon a certeine night,This Vision here exprest appear’d unto my dimmed sight...10John the Revelator reports that he was ‘in the Spirit’ (en Pneumati) when a voice spoke to him.11 Then again, we often learn only at the end of a story that the protagonist has been asleep, like Scrooge in Dickens’s Christmas Carol. 5 For a useful study, see Lynch, The High Medieval Dream Vision.6 Northrop Frye uses the word “dream” ‘in an extended sense to mean, not simply the fan-tasies of the sleeping mind, but the whole interpenetrating activity of desire and repug-nance in shaping thought’ (Anatomy of Criticism, 359).7 Langland, The Vision of William concerning Piers the Plowman, 1.1–13.8 Dante, Inferno, 1.11.9 Boethius, De Consolatione Philosophiae, 1.1.10 ‘The Vision of George Ripley’, 374.

He imagines different people saying, in different ways, you must be dreaming, and admits that he has been telling his dream with the hope that it may offer some guidance to the young.12By its nature, the dream vision provides both authority and deniability. On the one hand, it lets authors say they have a story on higher authority; on the other hand, they can say the story ‘is but a dream’, as Lewis Carroll does at the end of Alice in Wonderland, a late addition to the Menippean genre. The double edge perfectly suits a Menippean satire such as Lucian’s ‘The Dream, or the Cock’, in which a cobbler threatens the rooster who has awakened him long before dawn only to find that the rooster has the soul of Pythagoras and speaks as learnedly.13 Although the cobbler begins by wanting to return to his dream of riches, and goes on to discuss dreams and visions with his new friend Pythagoras, there is no indication, beyond the title, whether or not the whole story is a dream. As a dream it could in fact bring philosophy and humor into the life of a poor shoemaker, but could also be shrugged off as a pure fantasy. This fairly describes how The Chemical Wedding functions. Readers are entitled to think it is a revelation on the authority of Christian Rosencreutz, founder of the Rosicrucian brotherhood, or that it is a mere jest, a dream of esoteric attainment.Historically, there is a fine line between dream and vision, but the vision is generally considered the more significant. In Hebrew scriptures, the vision (chazon) always has a divine source, while the dream (chalom) may also be an ordinary dream or a false prophecy. Thus ‘Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed’, which he later recalls as ‘my vision by night’—the dream of four beasts that is recalled in the Apocalypse and is dramatized in an entertainment before the chemical wedding.14 In Daniel’s story (like Chris-tian’s first-person narrative) the word “vision” underscores the dream’s signifi-cance. In the New Testament, the ordinary dream (enupnion) is distinguished from the vision that occurs during sleep (onar), and that sleeping vision from a waking vision (optasia, used in a special sense).For his part, Christian Rosencreutz has several dreams over the seven days of his narrative, but this does not mean that the whole story cannot be his dream. Dante’s pilgrim dreams on each of the three nights he spends on Mount 12 Lucian in Eight Volumes, vol. 1, 7.13 Lucian in Eight Volumes, vol. 2, 171–239.14 Daniel 7: 1–2.

Christian’s dreams are significant in several respects, as we shall see presently. However, he attaches even greater importance to the ‘bodily vision’ (leiblichen Gesicht) that he experienced seven years earlier, a vision that has alerted him to the coming event.16 By this term he means something he has seen with his physical eyes, either a physical sight or a manifestation from the spiritual world. He says only that he has been observing the skies ever since, anticipating the wedding.Christian also remarks that he feels woefully unprepared for the wedding and all that it would entail:I also found by my self, the more I examined my self, that in my Head there was nothing but gross mis-understaning [unverstandt], and blind-ness in mysterious things, so that I was not able to comprehend even those things which lay under my Feet, and which I daily conversed with, much less that I should be born to the searching out, and understanding of the secrets of Nature.17For all his learning and piety, Christian lacks self-knowledge at the outset of his story. He is not a reliable interpreter of his dreams and visions, therefore, or even an altogether reliable narrator. As the 1616 editor notes in the margin, he is uncertain of his own status as a Christian and does not know whether or not he is of the elect.18 He embodies a contradiction within Christian theology: How can the humble Christian know that he or she is of the elect? How many who thank God for his blessings of wealth and power are neither humble nor elect? Christian’s humility almost keeps him from taking part in the wedding. If he is not in a position to interpret his dreams and visions, then who is? I will suggest that Andreae prepares to reader to interpret the story.Before turning to the several dreams, we should pause at the full title of Andreae’s story (Fig. 6.1): The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz in the Year 1459 (Chymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosencreutz. Anno 1459).19 In German as in English, the title is ambiguous. The possessive can indicate a story by or about Christian, and either his own wedding or a wedding that he attends or makes happen. Each of these interpretations is correct to some extent, and the ambiguity is surely intentional, the first of many puzzles in the work of a young 15 Dante, Purgatorio, 9.13–32, 19.7–33, 27.91–114.16 hr, 6; Andreae, Chymische Hochzeit, 5, hereafter abbreviated ChH.17 hr, 7; ChH, 6.18 hr, 7; ‘electio incerta’.19 ChH, 143."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Willard134<UN>author who loves a puzzle even more than Dan Brown and treats it more sub-tly.

It is a grace-ful vision, full of blooming poetic imagination, but strange and weird, as one is accustomed to in Andreae’s inventions.20Another puzzle is of course the date of 1459, 157 years before the story’s publi-cation. It refers back to the account of Frater C.R., as the brotherhood’s puta-tive founder was identified in the Fama. He is said to have died in 1484 at an advanced age; according to the story of his boyhood as an orphan in a German monastery and his youthful travels in the Muslim world, he must have been born in or about 1378. This makes him an octogenarian and thus an unlikely candidate for the usual sort of marriage. However, he is an accomplished as-tronomer, and one must wonder whether or not the dates have astrological significance.Then too there is the name that does not appear on the title page, or any-where else in the book. Andreae acknowledged his authorship only toward the end of his life, several decades later. Because there was no prefatory informa-tion regarding the text, it seemed that the first-person narrative was written by Christian Rosencreutz. Indeed, the English translation of 1691 stated on the title page that it was ‘written in High Dutch [i.e., High German] by Christian Rosencreutz’,21 and the ascription has followed into several English-language bibliographies.22 Meanwhile, it appears that the person who prepared The Chemical Wedding for the press, adding marginal notes in German and Latin, had seen a complete manuscript but did not have access to one while editing the text. For the story breaks off in mid-sentence, after which the editor notes: ‘Here are wanting about two Leaves in quarto, and he (the Author hereof )...re-turned home’.23 These words bring the story full circle, back to the hermit’s hut 20 Nicolai, Versuch über die Beschuldigungen welche dem Tempelherrenorden gemacht wor-den, 170: ‘Die Chymische Hochzeit soll von dem Vater Rosenkreuz 1459 geschrieben seyn; sie trägt aber in Schreibart und Denkungsart den Anfang des 17ten Jahrhunderts und den ganzen J.V.

The chemical wedding has been described, though enigmatically (aenigmatice), as an early reader remarked.24 However, the editorial statement leaves much to be answered about the text and its interpretation—almost as much as would remain if A Christmas Carol concluded with the note that Scooge awoke with the resolution to visit the home of his underpaid employee Bob Cratchit.2 The Dungeon, the Thread, and the DoorThe enigma was a standard form in alchemical literature.25 Numerous alchem-ical enigmata were published during Andreae’s lifetime as well as parabolae and arcanae. The celebrated Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius (1566–1636) wrote a Parabola seu Aenigma Philosophicum ad Filios Veritatis (Parable or Phil-osophical Enigma to the Sons of Truth, 1628).26 The purpose was to summarize the twelve treatises published as Novum Lumen Chymicum (A New Chemical Light, 1604) in a single allegory. Interestingly for our purposes, the narrator falls asleep repeatedly and is taken to the Garden of the Hesperides in his dreams, where Neptune explains the secret of the golden fruit. Sendivogius became a favorite of writers in the Rosicrucian tradition, and one finds similar enigmas and arcana in works by Jean d’Espagnet,27 Michael Maier (1568–1622),28 and Thomas Vaughan (1621–1666).29 Indeed, Sendivogius has been proposed as a model for the character of Christian Rosencreutz.30Christian’s story unfolds over the course of a week.

The remaining days mirror the first three. On the last Christian returns home, on the penultimate he ascends the seven levels of an alchemical tower where the chemical wedding takes place, and on the day be-fore that he faces a personal test before traveling to the tower. At the end of each day, he has a dream or vision. On the first three days, he has cautionary dreams that reflect of his anxiety. On the fourth and fifth days, he has wak-ing visions that prepare him for the chemical wedding. On the sixth day, after the wedding has been completed, he has “one Dream” lasting nine hours—a peaceful one, presumably, as he gives no detail. On the final day, the narrative breaks off at the time when he would have a dream or vision. We are left with the possibility that the whole story is a dream.The dreams that Christian records are premonitory, advising the dreamer what lies ahead and how he should approach it. They also introduce symbols that will be important to the story. After Christian has received the invitation to a Royal Wedding (Königs Hochzeit), he worries until he retires for the night (hr, 6; ChH, 5). He says his prayers and lies down, hoping ‘that perchance my good Angel by the Divine permission might appear, and (as it had some-times formerly happened) instruct me in this doubtful affair’ (hr, 8–9). He then dreams that he is amid a crowd of prisoners. They lie ‘fettered with great Chains in a dark Dungeon’. When they see a light overhead, they struggle with one another; despite their chains, each man tries to get closer to the opening. When a cord is dropped, several scramble to freedom; however, when the cord is dropped a second and third time, they pull one another off it, and no one escapes. An old man speaks to them about the sorrows of mankind and the grace of his mother. When the cord is dropped again, Christian climbs to safety, unaware that a sharp stone has struck his head. He is the last to escape, and still has his leg irons. The old mother (Magistra in the Latin note) addresses him as one of the ‘Redeemed’ (hr, 15). She says:My Son, let not this defect afflict thee, but call to mind thy Infirmities, and therewith thank God who hath permitted thee even in this World, and in the state of thy imperfection, to come into so high a light, and keep these wounds for my sake.hr, 17The speech should ease his mind. It also anticipates what lies ahead, for the ‘dark Dungeon’ is a ‘fenster Thür’ in the original: a ‘dark tower’ (ChH, 7). The chemical wedding will take place in such a tower (Thür)."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Willard138<UN>At the sound of a trumpet, Christian awakes and, he says, ‘perceived that it was onely a Dream’ (hr, 17). He leaves for the royal castle, carrying only four roses in addition to the pilgrim’s bread, water, and salt.31 He is the last to arrive before the gates close, and finds himself in a large, unruly crowd of invitees. A beautiful woman appears and warns them that they will be weighed. Despite his auspicious dream, Christian is convinced of his ‘unworthiness’ (unwurdig-keit; hr, 43; ChH, 33). He chooses to spend the night in chains so that he may leave without penalty. During the night, he dreams of another large group of men, each of whom is suspended from heaven by a thread (Faden) attached to his head. An old man flies about, holding a pair of scissors and clipping threads. Those who are closest to the ground, fall easily to safety, but anyone who has ‘over-exalted himself in the Air, of his Wedding, got so shameful a fall, that it carried even some of his Neighbours along with him’ (hr, 45). The dream gives ‘pleasure’ to Christian and ‘Comfort’ to his companion in chains (hr, 45–46). Again, the dream anticipates what will happen on the Third Day, when dozens of potential guests are weighed and all but the humblest of them are found lacking. When castle officials insist that Christian be weighed as well, he turns out to be the lightest—that is, to have the least burden of sin. A young official cries, ‘IT’S HE’ (der ists), recognizing that he is the long awaited guest (hr, 54; ChH, 41).After most of the interlopers have been dismissed, the worst of them chased by dogs, Christian and the other remaining guests are each assigned an atten-dant and are given leisure to explore the castle grounds. Christian’s scholarly instincts lead him to the ‘Royal Sepulcher,’ where, he says, ‘I learned more than is extant in all Books’ (hr, 75). He finds a book about the phoenix, on which he says he has written, as well as ‘Treatises, concerning the Lyon, Eagle, Grif-fon, Falcon and other like’. He studies the inscriptions on family monuments, resolving to share the information with ‘my thankful Schollars’ at home (hr, 76). He also visits the castle’s ‘Noble Library as it was altogether before the Ref-ormation’ (hr, 76); the anachronism is a quiet reminder that the tale was not composed before Christian is said to have died, in 1484. He marvels at a large book containing everything to be found in the castle itself, not only its rooms and portals but its writings and riddles. But he and his page are interrupted by a second page, who reminds that that the library and crypt are forbidden to any outsider. He then rejoins the other guests in exploring the castle’s work-shops. His page knows the rules, of course, but the pages have been told to lead the guests ‘according as each ones genius lay’ (hr, 76).31 For a suggestive study of The Chemical Wedding as an allegorical pilgrimage with autobio-graphical components, see Edighoffer, Les Rose-Croix, 23–45."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"139Dreams and Symbols in ‘The Chemical Wedding’<UN>That night, Christian reports, ‘a scurvy dream would not suffer me to rest; For I was all the night troubled with a Door which I could not get open, but at last I did it’ (hr, 95–96). The door is a reminder of his curiosity a few hours earlier, when his page unlocked the doors into the royal crypt and library. But the same German word Thür is also used for the castle’s massive gates, through which he entered its outer and inner precints. The gate itself is the symbol of a liminal space, a point of entry into the mystery.32 The outer gate bears the in-scription Procul hinc, procul ite, profani (go far away, you who are uninitiated), a variant of Virgil’s warning to the uninitiated during the descent into the un-derworld.33 For this reason, gates are common symbols for a new stage in the alchemical work; hence the many gates, or sections, in Ripley’s ‘Compound of Alchymie’.34 Christian’s boundless curiosity puts him at risk of going where he should not, where he is not yet invited, and the dream of the sticky door strikes him as a challenge rather than a warning.Christian does not dream the fourth night, when he falls asleep after many ‘Speculations’ about the beheadings he has witnessed and the events to follow. His room for the night is situated so that he alone of all the wedding guests is able to see what happens to the bodies. Six coffins are carried to the lake beside the castle and loaded onto six sailing ships. A chest containing the severed heads is loaded on a seventh ship. Each ship has a flame flickering about it, and Christian realizes instinctively that the flames are the ‘Spirits of the Beheaded’ (hr, 125). At this point the sighting becomes a visio, as the Latin side note states (hr, 124).He rises early the next morning, eager to see what will happen, and his page joins him on a tour of the castle. Descending the stairs, they come to a door with the name of Venus inscribed in copper letters, along with words in a strange alphabet. The door is unlocked, he realizes, because the coffins were carried through it the night before. Taking no heed of his earlier dream, he follows his page along a dark passageway and through a smaller door into the royal trea-sury. There he marvels at a sepulcher that includes a copper kettle from which a tree of metals grows, dropping precious stones as though they were fruit. The page tells him it is the sepulcher of Venus, and leads him through a cop-per door in the pavement, down a narrow set of stairs, and into a bedchamber. Christian pulls back the curtains on the bed and sees none other than the Lady 32 See Martin (ed.), The Book of Symbols, 558–559.33 hr, 26; Virgil, Aeneid, 6.258.

There is another tablet beside the bed, with the same secret alphabet, which the page interprets.Now behold (said the Page) what I heard revealed to the King by Atlas, When the Tree (said he) shall be quite melted down, Then shall Lady Venus awake, and be the Mother of a King.hr, 130Although the page tells Christian not to worry, now that the king is dead, he is soon assailed by Cupid, who laughs at the intruders before pricking his hand with a heated arrow.By this time, the other guests have arisen. They join their guide, a beautiful young woman, as she presides over the burial of coffins that guards carry from the castle. Christian realizes that his companions are being ‘deceived’ (betro-gen; hr, 133; ChH, 100). He listens as she talks about continuing their commit-ment, but now seeking medicines ‘helpful in restoring the present buried Royal Persons to life again’ (hr, 134). They then board the ships, one guest on each. They enjoy a pleasant cruise, entertained by swimming nymphs35 and singing sirens. Before long they arrive at a square island with a single building on it: a round ‘Tower of Olympus’ that turns out to have seven concentric walls each with seven stories of connecting rooms (hr, 139). An old man described as the tower’s warden or custodian guides them through several ground-floor labo-ratories where they will work the next day. Later, while the other guests sleep, Christian wanders outside and watches the skies. To his surprise, he ‘found that this night there would happen such a conjunction of the Planets, the like to which was not otherwise suddenly to be observed’ (hr, 141). Then, walking back to the tower he observes the flames of the royal souls converging at the top. Together with his vision the night before, this new information separates him from the other guests, who will continue to be deluded.Christian’s astrology is very likely influenced by Andreae’s older friend and mentor Tobias Hess (1568–1614), a Paracelsian physician and keen student of astrological prophecies. Christian’s birthday of 1378, hidden in a chronogram,36 makes him born during a year when Halley’s comet appeared. His death in 1484 occurred in the year of a notable conjunction of Saturn and Venus, and the miraculous opening of his tomb in 1604 was associated with Kepler’s super-nova. The chemical wedding of 1459 occurred at the time when two planetary 35 Edighofer (ed.), Rosenkreuzerschriften, 52, notes a parallel to the ‘new Olympians’ in the Philosophia Sagax of Paracelsus.36 hr, 98; Kienast, Johann Valentin Andreae und die vier echten Rosenkreutzer Schriften, 43."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"141Dreams and Symbols in ‘The Chemical Wedding’<UN>conjunctions were visible over Western Europe: a conjunction of Mars and Ju-piter in the southeast and another of Mercury and Venus in the northwest.37 The latter conjunction reached its peak, with a proximity of 15 degrees, on Good Friday.3 The Marriage of Heaven and EarthThe seven days of Christian’s story have some similarity to the creation week in the first chapter of Genesis, especially on the sixth day. For the great work ahead is nothing less than the creation of new life, a new king and queen made from the dead matter that, Christian realizes, has been transported to the tower. The tower itself is a traditional symbol of the alchemical vessel,38 and the seven levels correspond to the seven stages of the alchemical work in many accounts.39 The guests ascend through the first six levels, at which point they are separated. Three of them stay in the laboratory there to turn the alchemical substance into gold; they consider themselves the chosen ones. Meanwhile, Christian and three others are led to the seventh level, where they are to produce homunculi, little humanoids. A chiming clock or watch (Uhrlin) reminds them that time is of the essence. When it strikes one, a conjunction occurs, followed by a second conjunction at two and a third at three (hr, 159; ChH, 159). With the third strike, the first homunculus lays its head down to be decapitated. Three o’clock in the afternoon is the biblical ‘ninth hour’, the time at which Christ died on Good Friday.40 Of course, the chemical wedding goes much faster than the forty weeks required to produce a homunculus or the three days it takes Christ to rise from the dead, or Adonis for that matter. The homunculi literally grow up overnight. They leave the tower the next day as fully grown king and queen.Christian does not date his story beyond the year 1459. It begins quite simply ‘On an Evening before Easter-Day’ (hr, 3). If, however, the first day is Sunday, 37 According to the Swiss ephemeris for March 1459, Mercury was at 3° 11 and Venus at 26° 52; see http://www.astro.com/swisseph/ae/1400/ae_1459.pdf (last consulted May 8, 2014). In the appendix to his lavishly illustrated edition of The Chymical Wedding, David Newb-latt discusses astrological ideas in the main Rosicrucian manifestos.

Mercury, meanwhile, is the masculine principle in this story, associated with Prince Hermes (Hermes Princeps), that is, Hermes Trismegis-tus, the putative founder of alchemy, and with an ornate mercurial fountain where the guests wash their hands before entering the royal presence cham-ber (hr, 98).42 In classical mythology the union of Mercury and Venus—or rather of their Greek counterparts Hermes and Aphrodite—leads to the birth of Hermaphroditus, the androgyne.43 In alchemy the hermaphrodite is a sym-bol of the successful chemical wedding, the union of male and female, sky and earth.44 The invitation to the royal wedding promises no less, for it is sealed with the ‘hieroglyphic monad’ of John Dee (1527–1608), who regarded alchemy as terrestrial astronomy.45 The most systematic account of Dee’s sources and development treats the Monas Hieroglyphica as primarily a work of alchemical symbolism.46By the same reckoning, the seventh day would be Holy Saturday, and Chris-tian’s homecoming would begin during the Easter Vigil.4 The HomecomingOn the seventh morning, the young woman gathers the guests. She gives each a golden fleece, a symbol of their successful quest, and tells them they are all ‘Knights of the Golden Stone’.47 There is great joy as the new king and queen leave the alchemical tower and sail back to the castle.

But things change as they reach the castle precincts. The keeper of the outer gate presents a petition to the new king. Christian asks about the gatekeeper and is told he ‘was a very famous and rare Astrologer’, but was assigned to the gate after he ‘committed a fault against Venus, and beheld her in her bed of rest’ (hr, 213). He must stay on the job until he finds a replacement. He asks that Christian be assigned to the gate, for he knows somehow that Christian committed the same ‘fault’. The king is clearly troubled. He consults his astrologer, Atlas, before the homecom-ing meal, and although Atlas argues that Christian should replace the gate-keeper, the king leaves the decision up to Christian himself.Christian is troubled too. He likes the gatekeeper, who welcomed him as ‘Brother’ when he arrived at the end of a long day’s wandering—the last guest to arrive on the Christian principle that ‘the last shall be first’.48 But he knows that, given his advanced age, he would never see his native country again, and would spend no more time with his ‘thankful Schollars’ (hr, 76). In this un-certain state, he says goodbye to the king and his fellow guests, and leaves to spend the night with the other old men at court, the astrologer Atlas and the warden of the tower. The three retire to a ‘glorious’ room with three beds where they ‘spent almost two...’ (hr, 225–226). At this point the text ends. Presum-ably the three talk, but about what we can only guess. The editor, most likely Andreae,49 simply writes:Here are wanting about two Leaves in quarto, and he (the Author hereof ), whereas he imagined he must in the morning be Door-Keeper, returned home.hr, 226A literalist might wonder how he got through the gates, or found his way home, even under the full moon at Easter. It is difficult to remain a literalist after the visit to the Tower of Olympus, or to think the beheaded bodies are anything other than a metaphor for the dead matter at the start of the alchemical work—a common image in alchemical texts.50 But even here the editor has an expla-nation: ‘Autor dormit’. Christian, the first-person author, falls asleep. Perhaps 48 hr, 27; Matthew 20:16.49 Gilly, Johann Valentin Andreae, 78–79, cites correspondence among readers of the original manuscript, suggesting that another person could have prepared The Chemical Wedding for the press.50 Abraham, Dictionary of Alchemical Symbols, 20–22."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Willard144<UN>he is like Dante, who steps back from his alta fantasia (‘high fantasy’).51 The Latin verb dormire has the secondary meaning ‘to rest’, so one might say that he rests while the others sleep and decides, as they sleep, that he will return home. However, it seems just as likely that he falls asleep in the royal castle and awakens in the humble cottage where his meditation began.With this interpretation, the admonitory dreams at the end of days one, two, and three—dreams of the dungeon, the string, and the door—occur with a larger dream that is never mentioned, only inferred. Similarly, the visions at the end of days four and five—waking or “bodily” visions of the royal corpses and a planetary conjunction that together make it possible for Christian to understand the chemical wedding on day six—are part of a larger dream vi-sion. Similarly too, the undisturbed sleep at the end of day six indicates that he has learned the lessons of his dreams, has made peace with Cupid, and is reborn along with the King and Queen. He is then a born-again Christian, for he has learned the great mystery of Christianity: that Christ has already sub-stituted for him, as he was to substitute for the gatekeeper.52 He is not only the gatekeeper’s spiritual brother; he is also, as one commentator has remarked, the gatekeeper’s Dopplegänger.53 He is a gatekeeper by vocation, as another scholar notes;54 however, he keeps the gate to the Western esoteric tradition. He can thus be likened to the ‘Janitor Pansophus’, the All-wise Doorkeeper in the Musaeum Hermeticum.55In his dilemma, Christian responds to the question facing all visionaries: what to do when the vision has passed. Should he stay at the unearthly castle, which seems in many ways an image of heaven, or return to his ordinary life? We are not drawn into his thinking process beyond the information in the edi-tor’s note, but have been reading the ‘Narration’ he wanted to write down so that others could know what he saw.

When he signs the guest registry on the seventh day, he writes:Summa Scientia nihil Scire. [The highest knowledge is to know nothing.]Fr. Christianus Rosencreuts, [Brother Christian Rosencreutz,]Equis aurei Lapidis, [Knight of the Golden Stone,]Anno 1459 [In the year 1459.]hr, 221The motto is thoroughly Socratic and indeed recalls the defense of Socrates: ‘if I were to say I am wiser in anything, it would be in this, that not knowing very much about the other world, I do not think I know’.56 Socrates is the original philosophical satirist, the master of Menippus and Lucian.The dream vision can include satire; indeed, it helps to explain why the sat-ire can be directed at the narrator, who reports it without realizing how ludi-crous he sounds, and why he shows very little self-understanding, as often is true of dream figures. One of the Menippean satires that Andreae seems to have liked, and one that scholars suspect is closest to the now lost work of Me-nippus, is ‘Icaromennipus, or the Sky-Man’ (Ikaromenippos e hypernephelos), where the sophist Menippus turns astronomer and flies up to heaven to learn the truth about mystery cults, philosophy, and poetry from Zeus himself.57 The results are ridiculous, whence the comparison to Icarus rather than Daeadalus, while the flying and fantastic scenery are closer to dream. Like Christian, Me-nippus never suggests that he dreamed the whole thing, but that is probably the most charitable interpretation in both cases.In Andreae’s overtly Menippean satires, we find brief statements, often in dialogue form, that cover a whole range of social and religious issues.58 In ‘The Wanderings of a Pilgrim in [His] Native Land’ (Peregrini in Patria Errores), published two years after The Chemical Wedding, Andreae’s fifty-two intercon-nected sketches range from the pilgrim to the world and include fame or ru-mor (Fama), letters or books (Literae), and secrets (Arcana). The first of these 56 Plato, Apology, 29b (Loeb translation).57 Lucian in Eight Volumes, vol. 2, 267–323.58 A dialogue on magic from Andreae’s Menippus (1617) is translated in Churton, The Invis-ible History of the Rosicrucians, 320–323."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Willard146<UN>hints that he learned some hard lessons from his experience with the goddess Fama, and the book that bore her name in the title. Playing on the Latin fama he admits ‘my imprudence’ (imprudentia mea) and writes about learning the ‘boundary of my infamy’ (infamiae meae finem).59 Christian identifies himself as a pilgrim, with the traditional bread, water, and salt, and Andreae wrote other pilgrimage allegories.60 We might well think of Christian as Andreae’s youthful image, not only of his mentor Tobias Hess, but of the person he could become in old age.When The Chemical Wedding is read as a satiric dream vision, its treat-ment of alchemy makes better sense. The satire is directed primarily at the wedding guests who think that gold-making is the great goal of alchemy, who laugh when Christian is removed from their company, and who never learn the secret of the chemical wedding. The great mystery of the alchemical tower, the transmutation of dead matter into a new king and queen, is quite liter-ally over their heads. At the same time, the satire touches any literalists who suppose the process could be reproduced, beginning with the severed heads— traditional symbols of the first, or black, stage of alchemy.61 Such readers would be in the position of the three guests who help Christian prepare the homunculi but know nothing about the extraordinary planetary conjunctions that make it possible for the homunculi to become living souls like Adam and Eve. At the same time, as literalists, they would not understand the nature of literature, symbolism, and allegory or indeed of the Christian mystery at the center of the story.The Lutheran theologian John Warwick Montgomery, who has written the most extensive English commentary on The Chemical Wedding, maintains that Andreae could not have written the earlier manifestos, which, he says, are fun-damentally gnostic rather than Christian.62 The evidence for Andreae’s hand in all three documents has kept mounting, but Montgomery has a point. The Chemical Wedding poses a challenge to readers who took the two manifestos literally, readers who thought the tracts proposed social as opposed to personal reformation—a hard conclusion to reach if they read carefully the translation of Boccalini’s Mennipean satire about reforming the world, which was prefixed 59 Andreae, Peregrini in Patria Errores, 62.60 hr, 18; see Edighoffer, Les Rose-Croix, 23–45, esp. 25–26, and “‘Errores in Patria’”, 48–62.

Christian is an astrologer, like Atlas and the gatekeeper; he is also an alchemist, like the master of the alchemical tower; indeed, by the principles of dream interpretation, he is also in some ways the royals who invite him to the wedding, the guests who are turned away as unworthy, and even the women who make fun of his age. These are all aspects of his larger selfhood, as a universal human. So are the symbols we have already encountered.The symbols in Christian’s nightly dreams—what I suggest are the dreams within a larger dream—give warning to the reader. The dungeon finds Chris-tian in the depths with a large group of men, all reaching for a cord by which to pull themselves up. He learns that he will have to ascend to his proper level. The cord (Schnur) reappears on in the second dream, as the support for men trying to lift themselves up, and Christian learns that the cord can unravel, leaving only a string, which in turn can easily be cut. Later he sees men ascend the alchemical tower with ropes, with wings, or, as he does, with ladders. The third dream is the shortest but perhaps the most disturbing and concerns a door (Thür) that Christian struggles to open. It may be something of a warning, for Christian soon finds himself opening a door that leads to the bed of Venus and to an offense against the goddess that threatens to stop him from leaving the castle. The offense was anticipated in the first dream, where he suffered a head wound struggling to leave the dungeon—a sign, perhaps, of his excessive curiosity.The dream symbols show up at the alchemical tower. As we have seen, An-dreae’s word for “tower” (Thürn, modern Türn) is also used for “dungeon,” since the dungeon was typically the lowest level of the tower. The alchemical tower has no stairs at the ground level, and the guests therefore ascend to the second level by rope, with wings, or, as Christian does, on a ladder. They enter a series of workrooms on a different floor, and are guided where they belong. The ar-rival of Cupid announces the return of life to the dead matter prepared from the old king and queen, suggesting to Christian than Venus and the principle of generation are responsible rather than fire, as the other guests are ‘deluded’ into thinking (203). Indeed, the whole symbolism of the alchemical work is present in the seven-story tower.63 Willard, ‘Andreae’s ludibrium’, 780."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Willard148<UN>The preface to the first manifestos promised esoteric knowledge, ‘Secrets of all unvisible things in the World, according to the Doctrine of our Forefa-thers, and ancient Wisemen’.64 It went on to speak of ‘a perfect Medicine of all imperfect Bodies’, a medicine that could ‘change them into the best Gold’. Careful readers would realize that the secrets of making gold and the panacea merely represent the ‘heavenly Treasures of godly Wisdom’ that will be avail-able at the Millennium, a light compared to which the wisest have only sparks. They would therefore think twice about the Fama’s promise to support their cause with ‘more gold then both the Indes bring to the king of Spain’, espe-cially in light of remarks in the same manifesto about ‘ungodly and accursed Gold-making’.65 Far from being the “highest point” in their study, ‘the making of of Gold...is but a parergon’, that is, a by product. The Confessio made it even more explicit. The making of gold or the panacea is a ‘great gift of God’, not to be learned by or from ‘Deceivers’.66 Such deceivers are represented in the crowd of unworthy guests who boast of mastering perpetual motion and con-ceal weighty tomes under their academic gowns as they go to be weighed on day three. Christian, by contrast, emerges as the faithful guide, whose dreams may be studied for what they say about any honest seeker after truth. Their symbolism is more complex than this essay can show, touching all the symbols of alchemy but pointing ultimately to the apocalyptic ‘marriage of the Lamb’, for which all Christians must make themselves ready.67Bibliography1.

Not only their paintings and draw-ings, but also the expressive full-page woodcut series for the printed Books of Genesis and Revelation outgrew their function of Bible illustration, develop-ing iconographical reflections of Lutheran salvation history both in a private-ly human and in a societal sense. Even though Luther – wary of the Book of Revelation – allowed some symbolical or biblical-typological reading of the Creation story, biblicist and literalist readings remained predominant. The Lu-theran concepts sola fide and sola scriptura certainly enhanced a theology of the historical faith, a theology of the letter and the law rooted deeply in German Protestant culture, but typological exegesis also stimulated a biblical and anti-papist iconography for the Protestant cause. Among Lutheran explicators, artists and engravers, the historical and theological readings of the Creation and the Last Supper prevailed into the Enlightenment, while a gradual shift towards typology also became noticeable.2The Reformation revealed friction between the icon and the logos. The fear of idolatry brought iconoclasm, the destruction of Catholic monastic collec-tions of religious art, books and manuscripts. Distrust of the (Catholic) image also meant distrust of the human creative imagination. Nevertheless, through 1 [Biedermann] Gnothi Seauton 3, cap. 1, 14, 41.

These new icons generated from a new logos formed a mystical symbolism or a conceptual language system expressive of religious experience. The symbols of the Tree of Life, the Book of Life, or the School of Knowledge (Wisdom) were incorporated in an iconography determined by a mystical theological and Christian theosophical epistemology fed in turn by chiliast, astrological, alchemical, Hermetic and Christian magical-kabbalist traditions. Whereas chiliasm was concerned with contemporary socio-political concerns of con-flict and war as mirrored in the Book of the Apocalypse, the other disciplines sought to express private philosophical, religious and mystical experience. Ideas about the reformed school of universal wisdom and its teachings from the Book of Nature (astrology, alchemy, natural philosophy) as well as from the Book of Grace (mystical theology, Revelation of Christ) were associated with early modern Protestant Dissent. Valentin Weigel (1533–1588),3 besides Luther one of the most important reforming theologians, came to be regarded as a heretic because his speculative thought was seen to be based on heterodox biblical symbolism and conceptual imagery.None of the theologians could easily conceive of an interpretation of the biblical creation story other than the historical one. The first Lutheran theolo-gian to write about the story of creation combining theology, typology and Par-acelsian natural philosophy was Valentin Weigel.4 While remaining true to the Lutheran orthodox interpretation, Weigel’s epistemology concentrated on the process of reading, on the workings of the individual mind, and on the right motivation for the believer to read the Bible for his personal salvation. To Wei-gel, spiritual understanding essentially was a response to divine inspiration; the Bible should not be the theologian’s or humanist philologist’s object of tex-tual study. Weigel’s stance was nevertheless pedagogical: books still needed to be written because of the Fall: man is limited of necessity and no longer able to live his life at a purely spiritual level; if he were, he would know that the right Book is innermost in man and is God himself.5 Moving from the literalist to an increasingly symbolical approach, Weigel introduced (Paracelsian and Cusan) concepts such as the threefold world, the threefold man (body, soul, spirit), 3 Cf.

In other words, his reading of the creation myth laid emphasis on divine knowledge in man; it was not a literalist reading of Eve’s sexuality as sin, nor did it reveal any mi-sogyny. The role of the biblical snake was barely explained and the earthly Eve’s temptation as such was never mentioned; instead, Weigel consistently foregrounded his concept of Mensch (man). In his typological vision, the Old-Testament, historical, earthly, Adam (and with him mankind) needed Christ, the New-Testament, spiritual, heavenly Adam, to be saved.Weigel wrote most elaborately on the creation story in works (composed 1577–1578) such as Natürliche Auslegung von der Schöpfung (Natural Interpre-tation of Creation), Vom Ursprung aller Dinge (On the Origin of All Things), Informatorium, and Viererlei Auslegung von der Schöpfung (Fourfold Interpre-tation of Creation).7 The latter work comprised four commentaries on cre-ation offered as an alternative for the books of the literalist (Buchstäbischen) theologians and devised as a course taking the common believers (the “Ein-fältigen”) from an elementary understanding of the five days of creation to increasingly spiritual levels of understanding. The fourth explication was a work attributed to Paracelsus: De secretis creationis. Von Heimlichkeiten der Schöpffung aller Ding (On the Secrets of the Creation of All Things).8 Weigel’s first three books were first published by Heinrich Betkius as Das Geheimnüß der Schöpffung (The Mystery of the Creation) in 1701.9 Here the prelapsarian Adam is (hermetically) placed in the centre of the universe and is at the same time its circumference. Man’s Fall is explained as a turning away from the Di-vine, something which Adam, as an image (Bildnüß) meant to reflect the Divine and as an intelligent creation (vernünfftige Creatur), was not entitled to do. In this reading, the Fall is caused by man’s disobedience (Ungehorsam), a failure, also in Paracelsian terms, to know himself. From one of his first (posthumous) publications Vom Ort der Welt (On the Place of the World) – Weigel’s cosmos is still geocentric – to such seminal works as Der güldene Griff (The Golden Grasp), Weigel’s epistemology was a combination of theological and natural philosophical, i.e., mainly Paracelsian ideas.106 Cf. e.g Weigel, Gnothi Seauton 1, cap. 1, 3–5, 16, 20.7 Cf.

Most of the (Ps-) Para-celsian/Weigelian ‘corpus’ of writings was printed with considerable delay in two or three years, 1617–1620; because of their allusions to the largely fictitious Rosicrucian school or Brotherhood, some of these works are considered to be-long to the Rosicrucian debate as well. A large part was published by Johann Knuber, whose publications were also distributed from Frankfurt by Lucas Jennis, the well-known publisher of Rosicruciana. Most likely Johann Knuber was a pseudonym; he has been identified in the literature with the publisher Johann Francke. Under his own name, Francke published, for example, Johann Arndt’s edition of Thomas à Kempis’s Imitatio Christi combined with Theologia Deutsch, both seminal texts for Weigelians.11 Both Francke and Jennis were ac-tively engaged in the formation of a canon of devotional writings independent of the Tübinger Kreis and produced books recommended for the School of Wisdom (Schule der Weisen) or of the Holy Spirit (Schule des Heiligen Geistes) which also came to be associated with the Rosicrucian movement.One such canonical ‘reading list’ was printed in an appendix to Ps-Weigel’s Soli Deo Gloria (Glory to God Alone), possibly compiled by Knuber.

Thus the World could only be because there was a book, and the Book had become Man.17After a first spate of publications from 1617–1619,18 Weigel reception can be dated to the 1620s–1630s when the first anti-Weigel publications also began to appear.19 Weigel’s works were copied and circulated in manuscript at least from 1588 (the year of his death). The knotty problem of identifying Weigel’s authentic works has been grappled with in the literature.20 His main copyist appears to have been his deacon. The mystic theologian Benedikt Biedermann (ca. 1543–1621) worked in close cooperation with Valentin Weigel, whom he succeeded as pastor of Zschopau in Saxony. Weigel and Biedermann shared the influence of Paracelsus, Tauler, Theologia Deutsch, Sebastian Franck, and Hermes Trismegistus amongst other Hermetic and Neoplatonic sources. Weigel’s use of Nicolaus Cusanus, however, appeared distinctive while Bieder-mann’s discovery and elaboration of the works of Paul Lautensack grew out of his radicalized Weigelianism. In addition to copying and interpolating Weigel’s manuscripts, Biedermann had no qualms about attributing his own works to his deceased friend. An assiduous writer, he kept producing manuscripts 15 See note 1; the prefaces of both vol. 2 and Studium Universale explain the titles and, signifi-cantly, the division in three books.16 [Biedermann]: Studium Universale (1698), cap. 1, sigs.

Like most Weigelians, Biedermann hid behind his master, using Weigel’s name to ward off the inquisition. He was nevertheless denounced as a heretic and had to leave his post in Zschopau in 1599. Their ideas, circulated in manuscript during Weigel’s and much of Biederman’s lifetime, smacked of heterodoxy and soon after the first publications, Weigelians were denounced as dissenting heretics.21Especially after his master’s death, the student Biedermann developed his own mystical theological ideas, at first adapting, then radicalizing Weigel’s mystical theology. Stylistically, Biedermann can be seen to have developed a more intensive image-and-word play using a variety of elements (magic, al-chemy, number symbolism) adapted from Paracelsus and especially Paul Laut-ensack, independently of Weigel. Whereas Lautensack’s influence and writings are hardly noticeable in Weigel’s authentic works,22 the influence of Lauten-sack’s mystical and visual concepts of the Apocalypse became much stronger in Biedermann’s later works – brought about by his reworking of Lautensack’s texts in the late 1580s and published in series by the Rosicrucian sympathizer Jennis in 1619. Biedermann who, unlike Weigel, lived through the first decades of the 17th century, may have been aware of the Rosicrucian debate of the years following the publications of the Manifestos.Biedermann composed and compiled Latin and German manuscripts re-plete with repetitive and endlessly reworded cogitations. Passages and chap-ters, even sections, of one work were sometimes copied into others.23 Included were lexical and symbolic schemes developed from various other arts such as astrology, alchemy and kabbala. It was Biedermann who, increasingly in what Fritz Lieb termed his contradictorian writings, turned to the Cusan concept of coincidentia oppositorum, which he developed into his own spiritual method-ology, the combinatio oppositorum or combinatio duorum contradictoriorum.24 One of the most elaborate exercises in this Cusan methodology is the second volume of Gnothi Seauton: Astrologia theologizata (composed ca. 1587–1588). In the preface (as in the preface to Studium Universale) Biedermann (who wrote 21 On Biedermann’s deposition, see Opel, Weigel, 31–32; Lieb, Valentin Weigels Kommentar, 69–70.

This theologiz-ing technique, for him, meant a kind of metaphysical yanking together of the binaries of good and evil, alpha and omega, beginning and end, the old and the new Jerusalem, the old and the new Adam, the earthly and the heavenly Eve, in order to hold together in the mind and thus to transcend the paradoxes through a more formulaic theology of lexical and visual symbolism.The human arts and professions (after Adam’s fall) needed to be theologized, Biedermann explained, for example, with regard to astrology. He worked out his main image of the firmament, taking Weigel’s chapters on the difference between astronomy and astrology as a starting point. In astrological terms the planets and stars were seen to rule over natural or astrological/planetary man: Adam, after the Fall, was subjected to them as a result of the Fall; they were his earthly activities, his works, his existence. Yet, Biedermann argued, it should be the other way around: divine man (übernatürlicher Mensch) should rule over the firmament. Through Paracelsian and Hermetic analogies, the planets and stars were reflected in man (Adam, the medieval zodiacal man, man as micro-cosm). This image was subsequently merged with the Tree of Knowledge. Man eats from the tree every day and experiences good and evil. As in Weigel, Eve is conspicuously absent; rather, it is Man (Adam) who is seduced by the snake to eat and to know, and to be like God. Christ, the Tree of Life, is one with the Tree of Knowledge, but in Man. Thus Man himself is the forbidden Tree. Alpha and Omega, God and man, are taken together (zusammen nehmen) and evil must, therefore, be in God through man. This view of inherent evil was the dreaded consequence of the mystical logic confirmed in Cusan epistemology and transmitted via Weigel and Biedermann through to Jacob Böhme’s theoso-phy. Man stands in the middle of the Garden and has free will to remain good, within God. The heavens (Gestirn) are only a mirror or a painting on the wall, or an image.25 Studium Universale: The Book of the Knowledge of Good and EvilThe above image of the dichotomous Tree of Knowledge was first published in the second edition of Biedermann’s Studium Universale in 1695 (Fig. 7.1).

Thus the central syllable “di” appears in the two merged triangles or qualities on the trunk and in the centre of the cosmic sphere. The one central eye calmly gazes back at us, the viewers of the image, who are perhaps made restless, with our eyes looking in all directions, caught in these spirals. The en-graving, executed by an as yet unidentified artist, appeared in print together with an explicatory text. This text explains that the viewer may discern seven brighter stars and seven larger eyes looking around. Together with the seven hands they should be regarded as not observing the (inner) restful Sabbath; they are restless and represent natural human will or wilfulness, a spiritual separation from God. The seventh hand, we learn from the description, though still human, is closer to the Divine. The one eye of the Beholder is, like the Sun (the Light of Life, i.e., not the cosmic or natural sun), in the centre of all born and unborn stars and possesses universal knowledge. Finally, the one gaze is of the inner eye that needs no natural light and no natural object. The text ac-companying the image appeared in all later editions of Studium Universale but was lost in subsequent reproductions and manuscript copies.To many Jewish and orthodox Christians (not necessarily to Christian Gnos-tics) Paradise was lost through Adam and Eve eating the mixed fruit of death. The image does not represent the famous literalist scene in the Garden. Adam and Eve as well as the Edenic Serpent (often depicted as a woman in Chris-tian art) are absent. Neither the Ps-Weigelian image nor the text of Studium Universale refers explicitly to gender (separation), human sexuality and child-birth (procreation). Instead, the image of the Tree of Knowledge represents a Christian theosophical vision of spiritual illumination through inward self-knowledge (Erkenntnis) that does not accord with the theological orthodoxies of Catholicism or Protestantism but is in some ways closer to Hermetic and Gnostic interpretations of the creation myth and its implications for man-kind’s spiritual state of being.26The element of the spiralling whirl of restless eyes in the image of the Tree of Knowledge is most familiar in Böhmist and pietist literature and iconography.27 The idea behind the eyes should, however, be traced to authentic Weigel.

However, it shows thematic and textual similarities not only with Gnothi Seauton composed in 1571,29 and with Vom Judicio im Menschen (On the Power of Judgement in the Human Being, first published in: Geheimnis der Schöpfung, by Betkius in 1701) but also with Biedermann’s Studium Universale, which was composed consid-erably later. It is not known whether the Leipzig publisher Samuel Müller at all wondered about the authorship issue: among late 17th-century Weigelians and/or pietists, this issue simply did not exist.Der güldene Griff contains an elaborate philosophical analysis of the con-cept of the eternal or inner Eye. The physical act of seeing requires the eye, the air, light and the object. That the concept of the eternal eye differs from the human physical eye is clear but needs a further explication of both sen-sory perception and the psychological workings of cognition. Weigel devised a hierarchy of the senses which ranges from the lowest or most outward to the highest or most inward (circle); the movement is towards the (still) centre. The eye is given three aspects (analogous to the three worlds or realities); it is a threefold eye. The innermost eye is closest to the eternal eye and techni-cally does not observe any object that can be seen or fathomed and yet sees, understands, and reflects divine wisdom. Knowledge attained through physi-cal eyesight and, by implication, the other senses is not the highest visionary knowledge. Sensing (intuiting) or seeing (knowing) the Divine is in the Eye of the Beholder and does not require a natural object. One might call it the Mind’s eye, or the Soul’s eye, though here the metaphors mind, soul or eye should be understood to signify the human mind in its (near-) divine aspect only. The physical eye is nevertheless Weigel’s and Biedermann’s starting point in the description of sensory and epistemic cognition. The fleshly eye has outward as well as inward qualities; outwardly, these are the five senses. Unlike animals, humans were regarded to have access to higher ways of seeing.30 The threefold eye symbolizes three hierarchical aspects: the lower visus sensualis (sensory perception) or imaginatio / (Einbildung) – also seen as identical with the use of the senses; oculus rationis or Ratio (das Auge der Vernunft); oculus mentis seu intellectus or Mens (das Auge des Gemüths und Verstandes; Verstand). 29 See Pfefferl (ed.), Weigel, Der güldene Griff.

Man’s experi-ence of spiritual vision (understanding) is (through himself ) from the inside out, not the other way around.31The restless eyes circling in a Weigelian fixed hierarchy are described in Chapter 8 of Der güldene Griff, which, according to Lieb, was interpolated by Biedermann.32 In order for the highest or innermost eye to work, the lower and outward circling eyes have to stop moving. The process described is one of the spiritual approach to God, in death, or in life, though the latter is much more difficult as we cannot but use our senses, talk, think, imagine, see and hear things all the time. The Cusan image of divine consciousness, the Unitas, as op-posed to the Alteritas of creation, is also presented in Chapter 8. The Weigelian process of the human becoming aware of the divine Unitas takes place in the oculus mentis, human consciousness (and conscience), but the highest Eye is in the Divine; inner knowledge of self gnothi seauton / nosce te ipsum, is divine knowledge which sees from the inside out and requires no object – and the Bible is just another object observed in outer reality and providing intellectual knowledge (the book is man). Rather, it is the knowing subject-Eye that needs to see itself reflected in the mirror that is held up to it. The mirror can be the cosmos, nature, or a painting but knowledge does not emanate from the object observed but from the eye itself. God becomes the eye in man, and man is an image (Bildniss) of creation – as God needed to create in his image, unfold the image in himself, and himself in the image. As a created image, man cannot be independent. He belongs to God, not to himself; he is also the Eye and should reflect Divine knowledge, not go his own creaturely ways.33From the use of the textual elements “Stu-di-um Universale”, it may be in-ferred that the image and its accompanying explication have been produced for Studium Universale and have not served as an illustration to Weigel’s Der güldene Griff; yet, the image could very well be seen to fit the latter text re-printed two years later, as the 1695 description of the Weigelian symbol clearly echoes and may even be partly based on textual passages in Gnothi Seauton and in Der güldene Griff.31 Weigel, Der güldene Griff (1697), cap. 8, sig.

Faith is an act of the imagination or imagistic cognition. In the context of good and evil, for example, in Gnadenwahl (Election of Grace), evil in earthly creation originates in the fantasy (Phantasey des Sternen-Gemühtes), imagina-tion gone wrong, one might say. Weigel’s Eye is God or God’s Eye in Man, the self-reflecting Divinity; in Böhme, as in Weigel, the Eye is thus the eye of faith, das Wunder-Auge des Glaubens, a conceptual image described by Böhme in Viertzig Fragen von der Seelen (Forty Questions of the Soul) and related to the well-known image of Der philosophische Kugel (The Philosophical Globe, or, Sphere). This symbol appears to be one of the few images Böhme devised him-self in order to elucidate his thought. Unfortunately, though manuscript copies survive, no original version of the image appears in any of Böhme’s autographs. The image was bound with Viertzig Fragen von der Seele, Böhme’s answer to the questions posed by the Paracelsian Balthasar Walther.36 It was at the instiga-tion of Walther that Böhme used the symbol, also entitled the Wunder-Auge der Ewigkeit (Wonder-Eye of Eternity), to explain his theosophical thought. In Viertzig Fragen, apart from a description in ‘Erklärung der Philosophischen Kugel oder Auges’ (paragraphs 105–199), which is part of the answer to Walther’s first question about the soul’s creation, Böhme produced an additional text entitled ‘Das Umbgewandte Auge, Welches handelt von Der Seelen und ihrer Bildnüss’ (The inward Eye, which concerns the soul and its image), which applies to the same symbol of the soul’s image, the eye turned inward.An elaborate description of the meanings of the symbolic schema followed in the answer to Walther’s first question.

Johann Gichtel, following Gottfried Richter, the editor of the Thorn edition of a selection of Böhme’s works, reproduced the information that Balthasar Walther had read this passage in Reuchlin and that Böhme had used it in his Mysterium Magnum (composed 1622–1623); after the destruction of the first two tablets, a result of the adoration of the Golden Calf, Böhme wrote that God had given Moses an-other work on a globe (“Gott Mose eine andere Schrift auf eine Kugel gab”).38Was this use of the word Globus applied first in the metaphor of the Philo-sophical Globe devised earlier to visualize his interpretation of Creation and Revelation in the work instigated by Walther in 1620? Böhme explained the metaphor further in Mysterium Magnum: the philosophical globe pointed to the other Adam (Christ) who was to bring back the first and reinstigate his law in the globe of his heart, as in humanity inscribed with the Spirit of Jesus. At the centre is the globe of the human heart. This image was also cited, this time from the Zohar, by the compiler of the Thorn edition and quoted extensively by Gichtel as the law of nature in the conical heart of all humanity.39 Reading Böhme’s prescription of how to draw the image in the earlier work Viertzig Fragen, one does not easily recognize the same Christian kabbalistic context of the reception of divine law. Through the description of the three principles, however, the influence of Paracelsus and Weigel is evident. The Mysterium Magnum, the Creation of the world, and the first beginnings of Creation and the ten Gestalten of fire are also described. In the description of the second Gestalt the eye is identified with the globe.40The division of light and dark in the halves of the inverted Kugel was made later and applied to many frontispiece images in the Böhmist and pi-etist literature. Böhme wrote more than one text in various attempts to clar-ify or systematize his thought: Clavis, oder Schlüssel, for example, was one of the most influential shorter works written for this purpose. Böhme was clear about the fact that the meaning of the Divine Mystery cannot be described or depicted in an image. Still, in his urge to explain the complexities of his 37 Reuchlin, De arte cabalistica, f. lxiiiv.38 Böhme, Mysterium Magnum, in: Böhme 1682; 1730, par. 18.20–21; [Gichtel], Ausführlicher Bericht, in Böhme 1730, v, 65–66, 91–92; cf.

In the appendix to Viertzig Fragen, ‘Das umbgewandte Auge’, the image of the eternal eye refers to the human soul in its doubled (umgewandt, turned inside-out / inward) di-vine aspects and is described as the fire-eye or the fire-globe, finally in its three aspects according to the three principles. Inevitably, reference is made to the questions of good and evil and divine and human will. This text thus provides the most immediate descriptive context of the image of Böhme and Walther’s Philosophical Globe.41Böhme may well have been introduced (as suggested above) to the Ps- Paracelsian/Weigelian publications that came out ca. 1614–1620, the period immediately before he resumed writing after having been silenced by Gregor Richter’s Schreibverbot (Writing Ban). Books may have been brought to the Görlitzer’s attention by Paracelsian theosophers such as Johann Siebmacher, Balthasar Walther, Abraham von Franckenberg, and Johann Staritz. The poet, alchemist and Paracelsian Johann Staritz or Staricius (ca.1580–d. after 1628), the academic editor of (Ps-)Paracelsian and (Ps-)Weigelian texts, published at least four texts by Biedermann and edited a selection of Ps-Paracelsian texts on the Last Supper published by Francke as Philosophia de limbo (1618).42 In 1622 Staritz was one of a group of friends and critics challenging Böhme in Gör-litz on the subject of free will, which led to Böhme’s composition of Gnaden-Wahl in 1623.43 Together with the Paracelsian alchemist Balthasar Walther (1558–c.1630),44 Staritz may also have introduced Böhme to the (Ps-)Para-celsian/Weigelian literature, some of which he also edited. It is certain that Böhme knew Staritz’s edition of the third volume of Gnothi Seauton, textu-ally and thematically close to Studium Universale.45 The intriguing questions whether Böhme had also seen the images in Der güldene Griff, thematically 41 Böhme, “Das umgewandte Auge”, in: Viertzig Fragen, appendix, in: Böhme 1730.

Böhme himself provided the visual schema of his thought, initiating an iconographical tra-dition that could be merged with other elements from kabbalist, alchemical and magical sources in the theosophy, pietism and Rosicrucianism of the next century.Some 80 years later, towards the end of the seventeenth century, when Böhme’s works were finally printed in a complete edition, the new edition of Studium Universale was given the frontispiece image that explicitly referred to the tradition started at the beginning of the century. This image added by later publishers of Biedermann’s Studium Universale is not only Ps-Weigelian but also Böhmist. Part of the image was first depicted in the 1682 edition of Böhme’s collected works, illustrating his Gnaden-Wahl, and was simply incor-porated in the image of the Tree – a kind of image-referencing that can be found in more theosophical, pietist and Rosicrucian printed books. The three realms in Böhme’s image are the three principles, of light (paradise), of dark-ness (the dark world), and of fire (the stars or spheres), with the third principle emanating from a mixture of the first two and expressed in the four natural elements. Other similar elements occur: the hands holding Good (Wohl) and Evil (Wehe), the eyes in the triangles of light and fire, the central A[lpha] and O[mega] at the intersection of the three realms. Gnaden-Wahl also deals with the creation story, describing the Tree of Life or the Tree of Knowledge (chap-ters 7, 8) in the context of Divine and human (free) will. The meaning of human morality and the experience of suffering as expressed in the myth of Adam and Eve is worked out by Böhme as a consequence of his pre-creation myth.The artist of the Böhmist images, the chiliast and alchemist Michael Andreae (ca. 1628–1720), was largely responsible for the designs and wrote ac-companying descriptive texts followed by detailed references to textual pas-sages in Böhme’s works to help the reader understand the image and contem-plate Böhme’s thought.46 Besides Studium Universale the unidentified artist of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil will have known both Böhme’s and (Ps-)Weigel’s works. Böhme’s description of the Tree in his Mysterium Magnum, a mystical exegesis of the story of creation in the first Book of Moses (especially Chapter 17) and, more elaborately, in Gnaden-Wahl is reminiscent of Weigel. For Böhme (interpreting Moses’ words) there is only one tree, and depending on the realm in which it is rooted, it is manifest as the Tree of Life 46 Lamoen, ‘Der unbekannte Illustrator: Michael Andreae’. Andreae’s images and the expli-catory texts are reproduced."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"167The Mind’s Eye: Images of Creation and Revelation<UN>and/or the Tree of Knowledge.47 The cluster of metaphors Tree, Sun and Eye includes thoughts on the meaning of faith and the binaries of human and di-vine Will, Life and Death, Good and Evil, Darkness and Light. In Weigel’s Der güldene Griff knowledge of the self, unity and peace, was acquired through the pious and passive resignation (Gelassenheit) of the individual believer and a life in God’s will: prior to Böhme, Weigel described this Gelassenheit using the image of the Eye-eyes and indicating the various gradations of individual enlightenment.48Both Weigel and Biedermann in various texts described the Garden scene concentrating on the one Tree in the centre. In Gnothi Seauton Weigel argued against a literalist interpretation of the trees in the garden, pointing out these were not “wooden” trees; he used the typology of Adam and Christ to under-stand the Tree in Paradise as one Tree, merging the Tree of Life and the Tree of Death, as well as its Seeds and Fruits. The Tree of Death was seen to originate in the Tree of Life: Evil is generated from Good, and is in Good; consequently it has its existence in the Divine, not outside it.49 In Mysterium Magnum, the tree in the Garden of Eden becomes the Adamic tree planted in the three worlds and as such it is presented as a symbol of mankind. The tree is threefold man. The metaphor is developed through a theosophical or pansophical understanding of the Book of Nature. The natural or generational tree grows, has roots, a trunk and branches, brings forth fruit and seeds and finally a new tree. Clearly man lives in this world and experiences generational life understood by Böhme and (Ps.-)Weigel and Paracelsus before him as the third world or principle. Böhme applied the same metaphor of the tree throughout Mysterium Magnum, using it to interpret Moses’ historical relation of Adam’s trunk and branches to Cain and Abel, Noah and the biblical generational history that followed. At the same time (in the aspect of the world of light) the image functions as a similitude of the Tree of Life.50Finally, like Michael Andreae, the unidentified artist of the Tree of Knowl-edge may also have been the author of the newly composed text explaining the imagery. Unfortunately, there is no external evidence to support this.

Whereas part of the description of the Tree of Knowledge appears more indebted to Biedermann and through him to Weigel, Sebastian Franck’s Baum des Gutes und Böses and Cusanus’s unitas and alteritas, Andreae’s description of the Gnadenwahl image reflects Böhme’s three principles in recognizably Böhmist terms of the creation of man’s will as an image of God’s will.52 The description accompanying the Tree uses both Weigelian and Böhmist phrase-ology, adopting very specific linguistic and visual symbolic details close to pas-sages in Biedermann’s Studium Universale as well as in Böhme’s Gnadenwahl, though a comparison of the texts reveals no direct quotations. For example, the central concept of “Stückwerck” (patchwork) as an instance of man’s lim-ited studium particulare rather than universale is clearly from Biedermann.53 Another element, the number 7 in the 7 stars and eyes circling around the cen-tral Sun and Eye, clearly stems from Gnadenwahl, whereas the concept of the Sabbath can be found in Böhme as well as in Weigel. Elements such as the natural or supra-natural tree, the process of its rooting in the three realms, the seed it grows from and the fruits it carries under the influence of the Sun and Mother Earth appear to owe to Böhme’s description in Chapter 8 of Gnad-enwahl though all can be traced to (Ps-)Weigel as well; more importantly, this merging explains the effectiveness and the appeal of this meaningful symbol.The question remains whether the artist and the publisher were themselves aware of the background and the Weigelian ideas concerning spiritual free-dom. It appears even more unlikely that the artist and/or editor of the 1695 edi-tion of Studium Universale meant to associate the Weigelian-Böhmist Tree of Knowledge with Johann Staritz and his circle. As Staritz was never mentioned in Böhme’s Gnadenwahl, the artist may not have been aware that Staritz op-posed Böhme on the issue of free will or that he was active as a publisher of Ps-Weigel. The image certainly does not tell us about these polemical altercations. 51 Böhme, Der Baum des Glaubens, in: Die Menschwerdung Christi, pt 3; cf. Harmsen (ed.), Böhmes Weg in die Welt, 276–277. A related image in Betkius’s edition of Von der Menschwerdung Jesu Christi, Amsterdam 1660, can be traced to explanatory texts in Ps-Franckenberg, Oculus aeternitatis, cap. 7, 20, also published by Betkius in 1677. These images may have influenced Andreae.52 Cf. Andreae’s description to Weigel, Gnothi Seauton 1, pt 2, cap. 6.53 Cf.

He lived in Utrecht in the 1690s and his position in Gichtel’s Böhmist group was marginal, though he may have been in contact with Böhmists in Germany. He could have designed the image earlier though its execution is technically less perfect than that of the Böhme series. The image may have originated in circles around Gichtel, Betkius and Franckenberg, but a more likely environment is that of the Leipzig pietist pub-lisher of Studium Universale, Samuel Müller. In any case, the author of the de-scription accompanying the Tree in Studium Universale, clearly was a Böhmist or pietist who understood Böhme’s work to have been inspired by Weigel.54 In the end, the publication of Studium Universale and the additional syncretist image (with deliberate citations of elements from Andreae’s Gnadenwahl im-age) was a conscious attempt at superimposing Böhmist and pietist thought onto what was thought to be a work of Böhme’s predecessor, Valentin Weigel. Paul Lautensack (1478–1558): The Book on the CrossDramatic political and chiliastic imagery abounded in the broader European context of early modern cultural and socio-political pamphleteering.55 Since the days of Luther, Dürer and Cranach the Elder, the Book of Revelation (Apoc-alypse), and within this book, the Book of Seven Seals, though barely accepted within the Protestant biblical canon, had been given contemporary ideological and political contexts for those who opposed the Pope, the church’s intoler-ance and the persecution of heresy. Anti-Catholic and anti-clerical sentiments made it a most popular book for common believers and radical dissenters alike. Weigel did not devote a separate work to Revelation but his reference to Sebas-tian Franck’s book on the Tree of Knowledge definitely had a similar political subtext.56 The Weigelian Paul Nagel’s works are exemplary in this context and Stefan Michelspacher devised symbols of a Christian-alchemical apocalypse in his Cabala.57 Böhme wrote a number of shorter polemical texts answering 54 Cf. Christoph Geissmar’s argument that Michael Andreae probably was the artist of the image in: ‘Augen, Augen, immer wieder Augen’.55 With regard to chiliast interests of the Rosicrucians, see Gilly, ‘„Der „Löwe von Mitter-nacht“, der „Adler“ und der „Endchrist“’.56 Cf.

In 1542 he was banished from Nürnberg for three years for his deviant speculations. Luther and Osian-der declined his work which was never published in his lifetime.59 Abraham von Franckenberg (1593–1652) in his correspondence referred to Lautensack’s Vom Opus mirabile (On the Wonderful Work) and knew chiliasts and Rosicru-cian sympathizers such as Paul Felgenhauer and Julius Sperber.60 It is not clear whether Franckenberg knew the chiliast and Böhmist Paul Kaym (1571–1634) personally, even though Gichtel associated Kaym with Franckenberg in the context of the Oculus Aeternitatis (Eye of Eternity) publication, a work which was wrongly attributed to Kaym.61 Kaym was a personal friend of Böhme’s from Görlitz, who responded to the Rosicrucians in 1616 with a missive published by Johann Bringer in Frankfurt.62 P.K. can be identified as Kaym on the basis of his interest in the subject of the Apocalypse in this Sendschreiben. Kaym’s manuscript work on Revelation, Drey unterschiedliche Tractat, which contains Lautensack’s writings nearly complete,63 was commented on by Böhme in the two-part letter on the Book of Revelation (composed in 1620).64 Subsequently, Kaym revised his work from 1624 to 1626. Böhme was thus very familiar with Kaym’s study of Lautensack as well as with his presentation of Lautensack’s 58 On Böhme and Lautensack, cf.

In the theosophical letters addressed to Kaym, Böhme did not mention Lautensack by name. Instead, Böhme as doctrinal po-lemicist preferred to refer his friends to passages in his own major works. In general, Böhme objected to the more politically militant and nationalist ten-dencies especially in his chiliast friends, tendencies which were clearly also present in some of the later Biedermann texts published by Staritz.Biedermann’s radicalized Weigelianism found its inspiration in Lautensack and influenced chiliasts, Rosicrucian sympathizers and Böhmist Christian theosophers. Any Ps.-Weigelian text with fairly easily recognizable Lauten-sack textual materials as well as visual schemes and symbols was composed and/or interpolated by Biedermann. In his Theologia Weigelii and in other works such as the polemical De Bono et Malo in Hominem (On Good and Evil in Man) he further radicalized Weigel’s epistemology with the help of Laut-ensack and the Cusan unification of opposites of Creation and Revelation, providing more frequent references to the Apocalypse. A comparison of the earlier Gnothi Seauton vol. 1 with Biedermann’s Theologia Weigelii and Gnothi Seauton vol. 3 (containing the most explicit defense of Lautensack and Paracel-sus) shows this radicalization. Even though Weigel’s name appears on the title pages and his possible awareness of Lautensack need not be denied, it was in fact his friend and follower Biedermann who edited the 1619 volume, the first publication of Lautensack’s works.65Biedermann’s pseudonym for Weigel: Vdalricus Wegweiser Utopienses re-flected his belief that Weigel pointed the way to the reality of Utopia. In fact, he used the pseudonym for one of his studies of Lautensack’s Book of Revela-tion. In his editions, Biedermann repeatedly pointed out the importance of Lautensack who, to him, acquired universal knowledge and who found the key to the Bible and Divinity in his studies of the Book of Revelation. For Bieder-mann, the threefold Book thus became the living Book on the Cross.66 The secret of secrets, described in the text De arcana omnium arcanorum in Vom opere mirabili, as Biedermann’s and Lautensack’s theologia crucis, the theology 65 Paul Lautensack [ed.

In Theolo-gia Weigelii Eve’s role is given renewed emphasis.68 The language in some of the Ps.-Weigelian and Rosicrucian printed works and manuscripts often reads like a Latinate rephrasing of Weigel and/or Biedermann, especially, for example, on the theme of the heavenly Eve or Sophia, Mother of all creatures, a concept present in much Christian theosophy from the 16th to the 18th century and developed from Paracelsus via Weigel and Biedermann, to Jacob Böhme and his followers. The heavenly Eve, in Christian theosophy as well as in a number of classical Gnostic writings, was associated with Sophia (personified divine Wisdom). In 17th-century theosophy the prelapsarian Eve became the Virgin Sophia, at the same time Mother of all creatures, and she was paired with the Virgin Mary (as the new Eve). Böhme’s Sophia, the Virgin of Knowledge, was a self-reflecting divine image containing the earthly realm. The origin of the theosophical symbolical association of Eve or Sophia with Mary lies in Mariol-ogy and Sophiology. Influenced by Lautensack, Biedermann appears to have been one of the first to combine the symbol of the earthly and heavenly Eve (Mary) (Creation), with the Virgin of the Apocalypse (Revelation).69Towards the turn of the 17th century two prominent church historians eval-uated these heterodox writings; whereas Gottfried Arnold’s survey Kirchen- und Ketzer- Historie was the first to take a positive approach, Ehre-Gott Daniel Colberg in Platonisch-Hermetisches Christentum denounced heterodoxy.70 To Colberg, Weigelians and Böhmists mixed Christian theology with Platonic and Hermetic philosophy: these fanatical heretics, he argued, downplayed origi-nal sin and caused the same kind of confusion that the Valentinian Gnostics and the Manicheans had done. Devoting an entire chapter (ii, 3) to the Bibli-cal creation myth, Colberg was possibly the first critic to analyze the mystical symbolical interpretation of the Tree of Knowledge based on (Ps-)Weigelian 67 Cf.

Regarding the Paracelsists and Weigelians, Colberg in fact built on an earlier attack by the orthodox Lutheran theologian Niko-laus Hunnius, who, in 1622, after the first wave of (Ps-)Weigelian publications had described the Rosicrucians as the propagators of the “new theology”. What bothered Colberg the most was that both Weigel and Böhme spoke of only one tree in the middle of the garden, which made the Tree of Life and the Tree of Death one and the same but manifest under different aspects. After the 1682 publication of Böhme’s Collected Works, the influence of the Görlitz mystic on 18th-century Christian and Rosicrucian theosophy became predominant. Though an orthodox opponent, Colberg provided the references to the liter-ature necessary to interpret the theosophical Tree of Knowledge (cf. ii, 3.12) and he did so four years before the Weigelian-Böhmist image was published in Studium Universale. In this case, Colberg’s perceptive insights, though some-what obscured in a polemical and over-speculative book, were on the mark.Perhaps stung into a renewed defense of theosophy, a second wave of Ps-Weigelian publishing followed from ca. 1692 to about 1702, seemingly a re- enactment of the first. Clearly those involved with the publications by Samuel Müller in Leipzig meant to reprint Knuber’s 1618–1619 editions.71 The Lauten-sack texts in the 1619 edition were not republished, which may seem to suggest a diminished interest in those volumes at that time. However, much of Bie-dermann’s Lautensackian work was republished; Studium Universale saw three editions, all three with the impressive and influential symbolic engraving pre-senting the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil accompanied by the newly composed explanatory text. Clearly at this time it was regarded as one of the seminal texts in the Weigelian corpus: it was essentially a programmatic text that had been criticized the most by critics such as Georg Rost and Nikolaus Hunnius. The newly added image and its description advertised its importance to Böhmists and pietists. Colberg could not have seen the image in 1691 but the image possibly meant to challenge his orthodox criticism.In the early 18th century, the Ps-Weigelian image of the Tree of Knowledge was included in a manuscript compendium of secret symbols attributed to a Rosicrucian school of wisdom: the original 17th-century Rosicrucian move-ment was referred to in the symbols as well as in renewed publications from 1710 onwards, as Böhmists and radical pietists wondered about the survival or revival of the first ‘Brotherhood’.72 The series included the complex alchemical 71 Samuel Müller also published works by Christian Hoburg, Caspar Schwenckfeld and Da-vid Joris.72 Cf.

Wilke1 Elements from a Lost PortraitQuite a revealing visual document of early modern Christian Kabbalah must have been the painted portrait of Paul Yvon, the lord of Laleu (c.1570–1646), a French merchant-banker under Cardinal Richelieu, whose wealth allowed him a second existence as mathematician, esoteric theologian, and self-styled mes-siah. Unfortunately, the whereabouts of this work of art are forgotten, as is the life of the man,1 and both can only be imagined thanks to the description that Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux, a nephew of Yvon’s wife, gave in his Historiettes (Gossip Tales) of 1657.2The prophet, whom a mock poem of the time calls ‘the learned algebraist and kabbalistic patriarch’,3 had himself painted in the 1630s, already in his old age, but still looking youthful and energetic. The portrait showed him seated on a chair, his long white hair flowing over a black velvet dressing-gown. Above him hovered the sign of Sagittarius. A flash of lightning shot forth from the archer’s bow, penetrated Yvon’s head from behind and then reemerged, arrow-like, from his mouth. On his left, there was a temple with its doors wide open and a tomb covered by black cloth. Two French inscriptions on the portrait read Bonne nouvelle annoncée par Paul Emile (The good news announced by Paulus Aemilius) and Un loup y a (There’s a wolf within). All the free space on the portrait and on its margins was covered with geometric drawings and 1 First-hand studies on him are more or less limited to Delayant, “Paul Yvon, sieur de Laleu”; Secret, “Notes pour l’histoire des juifs en France et les hébraïsants chrétiens”; and Matton, Le Discours de vraye philosophie demonstrative (1628), 14–26, in a chapter titled “Paul Yvon, sieur de Laleu”.2 Tallemant des Réaux, Historiettes, vol. ii, 554–558; concerning the portrait, see p. 555.3 Mersenne, Correspondance, vol. xii, 381.* This paper was presented on July 9, 2011, at the University of Szeged, in the framework of the conference Lux in Tenebris: The Visual and the Symbolic in Western Esotericism, third confer-ence of the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism (esswe) in cooperation with the Research Group for Cultural Iconology and Semiography, University of Szeged, and the Szeged Centre of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Wilke180<UN>arithmetic calculations, commented here and there by words in Hebrew script. Hebrew words also appeared on Yvon’s coat of arms, which prominently dis-played a lion, meant to be the Lion of Judah.(a) The black tomb on the painting was probably that of Yvon’s late wife, Marie de Tallemant. She originated from a refugee family of Calvinist bankers, who had migrated from the Southern Netherlands to the Huguenot stronghold of La Rochelle. Paul Yvon worked as an associ-ate of the Tallemant family throughout his life. His own parents hailed from Touraine; and he was born shortly before or shortly after they fled from Bléré, a town near Tours, to La Rochelle in order to escape the Saint Bartholomew massacre.4 The couple married in 1594 and were blessed with nine children, while Yvon’s commercial society with his brothers-in-law, the bankers Gédéon and Pierre Tallemant, prospered thanks to the grain and wine trade with Brittany.5 Occasionally, Yvon would develop a more daring entrepreneurship; and in the last years of the sixteenth century, he was even part of the failed intent at sending one of the first French merchant vessels to the Caribbean.6 The brothers Tallemant and their brother-in-law were in 1604 the richest enterprise in La Rochelle.7(b) Yvon’s long hair hints to the rather unexpected sides of this Weberian Protestant businessman. Pierre Tallemant’s son, Gédéon ii, tried to char-acterize his personality with the following psychological sketch: ‘This man, who had a good wit, but a disorderly one, indulged during his lei-sure time in speculating on all kinds of things that were beyond him. As he was by nature given to vanity and believed that he stood infinitely above all others of his class, and as he had not received any refined liter-ary education, he learnt it all without order and principle, and he ended up accumulating in his head such a confusion that there will perhaps never be a man who would say and do more oddities than him’. Though he was of a passionate, brave and charitable temper, his inclination to extravagant fantasies would have the upper hand.8 In his daily life, he 4 On the emigration of protestants from Touraine to la Rochelle, see Dupin de St. André, His-toire du protestantisme en Touraine, 135–136.5 Tallemant, Historiettes, vol. ii, 555.6 Trocmé and Delafosse, Le commerce rochelais, 164–165.7 Parker, La Rochelle and the French Monarchy, 63.8 Tallemant, Historiettes, vol. ii, 554: ‘Cet homme, qui avoit de l’esprit, mais un esprit desréglé, se mit dans son loisir à resver à des choses qui n’estoient nullement de son gibier; il estoit na-turellement vain et s’estimoit infiniment au-dessus de tous ceux de sa vollée; et puis, n’ayant point de lettres, il n’apprenoit rien dans l’ordre, et ne sçavoit aucun principe; cela mit une"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"181Where Geometry Meets Kabbalah<UN>imposed upon himself a number of ascetic rules, such as neither cutting nor combing his hair or beard and never eating in company. Though a womanizer by nature, according to his own confession, he decided upon a life-long regime of sexual abstinence from the time he became a wid-ower in 1619.9 The French protestant biographers Eugène and Émile Haag called Yvon a “half crazy apostate”,10 but his first biographer observed that this presumed madman organized his private life more successfully than many wise men did, and that he even played a distinguished role in pub-lic affairs.11(c) Paulus Aemilius, the Roman republican general who conquered Greece, is treated by Plutarch as the model statesman12 and became Yvon’s role model as well. He was involved in the municipal government of the Cal-vinist seaport from 1603, when he first became city councilor.13 He was so uncompromising in his piety that in 1607, in order to have a Jesuit preach-er expelled from La Rochelle, he was chosen to plead the city’s cause in front of king Henry iv, who qualified his staunchly Protestant discourse as “seditious”.14 Yvon became city treasurer in 1612; one year later, he bought the noble estate of Laleu, one mile out of town.15 In April 1616, he was elected mayor of his city. He revealed himself, however, as an out-spoken royalist and was at daggers drawn with the Huguenot citizenry, eager to defend with arms La Rochelle’s political and religious autonomy. Virtually at the same time, a theological conflict with the clergy erupted, because Yvon used his tenure and his position in the urban oligarchy to proclaim a theology that was all but orthodox.16(d) The “good news” alluded to on the portrait was the divine message that Yvon believed himself to have received. He would point to a prophetic experience he had had in 1614, while on a business trip to Paris, and cel-ebrate this as the beginning of his redemptive mission.17 He believed that telle confusion dans sa teste, que peut-estre ne viendra-t-il jamais un homme qui die ny que face plus de grotesques que luy’.9 Tallemant, Historiettes, vol. ii, 557.10 Haag, La France protestante, vol. v, 551–552: ‘cet apostat à moitié fou’.11 Delayant, ‘Paul Yvon’, 582.12 Holland, ‘Plutarch’s Aemilius Paullus and the Model of the Philosopher Statesman’.13 Meschinet de Richemond (ed.), ‘Diaire de Joseph de Guillaudeau’, 196.14 Jourdain, Ephémérides historiques de La Rochelle, vol. i, 456.15 Delayant, ‘Paul Yvon’, 547.16 Robbins, City on the Ocean Sea, 141–142.17 He remembers in 1632 that the event took place ‘il y ait dix-huict ans’.

He would interpret his mathematical discovery as a sort of prophetic rev-elation of world historical significance; indeed he calls it ‘a light that had been hidden from humanity since the creation of the world until the present’, key to the perfection of many sciences.18 Jesus, according to Yvon, did not know (or did not disclose) all truth: a revelation of a new kind had now occurred and he had been elected as the modern Abraham for the task of spreading it among humanity. The new age he was about to inaugurate by scientific means would complete and surpass the redemp-tive work started by Christ. Everybody would in the end be saved, even the most wicked men, even the devils themselves.19 When interrogated by the Calvinist pastors, Yvon insisted upon these scandalous teachings and even sent them in writing to the church synod – signed with his own blood. For a decade, his case went through a series of excommunications, each time followed by Yvon’s retractations and protestations of Calvinist orthodoxy. But it never took long until Yvon rekindled the scandal with even more provocative proclamations.(e) The wolf was a sort of totem for Paul Yvon, because the French word loup (a fortiori the motto VN LOUP Y A, “There is a wolf within”) offered a good potential for anagrams of his own name. Paul Yvon anagramized himself usually by way of translitterations into Hebrew and back into French. “Paul”, pe-vav-lamed, yields not only the anagram lamed-vav-pe (loup, “wolf ”), but also the alternative translitteration pe-lamed-aleph (pele’, “miracle”), thereby evoking the Roman she-wolf which, on his lost portrait, congregated with the Lion of Judah. As we shall see, there are signs of crypto-Catholicism already in the first mathematic publication Yvon authored in 1619; and his leanings towards the central monarchy and church strongly came to the fore in the course of his partly political, partly theological conflict with the pastors and the citizens. Still, in 1622, Yvon fought bravely in the war against the Catholics and even lost his eldest son in battle;20 but on 3 March 3, 1627, at the beginning of his city’s writes ‘vingt ans’; the pastor Merlin wites, on December 2, 1617, that Yvon ‘revint, il y a quelques années, de Paris, imbu d’opinions contre Dieu et sa parole’; see Dunan (ed.), Journal manuscrit de Jacques Merlin, 301.18 van der Bist, Quadrature du Cercle, 4.19 Dunan (ed.), Jacques Merlin, 300–301, 332.20 Meschinet de Richemond (ed.), ‘Diaire de Joseph de Guillaudeau’, 196."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"183Where Geometry Meets Kabbalah<UN>uprising, he declared that he refused to be a member of the Reformed church any longer, and the synod reciprocated by declaring him an apos-tate. For a year and a half, in which he nominally kept his municipal of-fices, he followed a religion of his own. He was able to leave the besieged city on 16 May, 1628, half a year before its capitulation,21 and still during the same year abjured Protestantism. He later attributed his conversion and religious reeducation to Father Anastaze, a Capuchin from Nantes, one of the main Catholic preachers who were active in La Rochelle after its capitulation in October 1628. After he went to live in Paris in Decem-ber 1633, Yvon’s Catholicism took a more passionate turn. In 1639, he fell spiritually in love with a nun, Angélique-Marie of Jesus, the abbess of the Carmelite monastery of Saint-Denis in the northern Parisian suburb. Yvon immediately settled in the vicinity as one of the monastery’s bene-factors and stayed there until the abbess died in 1643. After intending for a while to return to La Rochelle, he moved to the suburb of Bourg-la-Reine, south of Paris, and died there in 1646.22(f ) The geometric drawings hinted at a vocation he felt since his youth, push-ing arithmethics far beyond his daily commercial practice. ‘Ever since the beginning of the world, all learned men have been convinced that among all sciences of humanity, Geometry is the only true one, based upon clear and evident principles.’23 Geometry and theology were as entwined for him as they were for Guillaume Postel (1510–1581), whose Christian Euclid defined God as the line, the Logos as the circumference of the circle, the divine incarnation as the surface.24 Yvon had published his first book on circle squaring in 1619.25 After his conversion, he decided to invite, on 6 August, 1630, a number of famed mathematicians to discuss his theo-rem publicly at the Jesuit library in Paris.26 The meeting entailed a large number of printed refutations, the harshest of which were authored by 21 Ibid., 369.22 Tallemant, Historiettes, vol. ii, 557–558.23 Yvon, Propositions mathematiques, in: Matton, Le Discours, 20: ‘Depuis que le monde sub-siste, tous les Doctes ont estimé qu’entre les Sçiences humaines, la Geometrie est seulle veritable, fondée sur principes clairs, et évidens.’24 Postel, Les premiers élémens d’Euclide chrestien, 4, 6, 10.25 It was published by a fellow merchant of La Rochelle, Martin van der Bist (Quadrature du Cercle, op. cit.) and defended by a Scottish professor of theology at the La Rochelle acad-emy; see John Dumbar, Quadrationis circulis, et cubi duplicationis approbatio, in the same year.26 Mersenne, Correspondance, vol. ii, 550.

In his blend of Biblical language and geometrical form, he shared ideas expressed by Guy Lefèvre de la Boderie (1541–1598) and Claude Duret (1539–1616), who both believed that God had revealed all arithmetic and geometric science to Moses by communicating him the number, proportions, and meaning of the Hebrew letters.32 As one of the last epigons of Renaissance Christian Kabbala,33 Yvon conflated Jewish and Christian uses of Biblical symbols, and added some post- Christian ones. Most Hebrew terms he used on his drawings refer to staple Chris-tian concepts such as the Hebrew terminology of the Trinity.(h) The Temple hinted, most probably, at Yvon’s vision of a “Temple of Peace” that should unite Christians and Jews in a renewed Catholic Church. Yvon saw his circle squaring as a blueprint for its building secrets. In 1627, he presented his solution of the squaring problem in the form of an etch-ing called “The Secret Figurative Temple or Temple of Peace”, of which no copy seems to survive; it apparently pursued the ambition of translat-ing his geometry into a sort of a mystical architecture.34 It was possibly this figure, which visualized the essence of his mathematical theorems, that Yvon had engraved on a golden plate right after the surrender of 27 All of them are collected in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, Vz 1040 to 1045.28 Mersenne, Correspondance, vol. iii, 230–231, 354.29 Mersenne, Correspondance, vol. iv, 323.30 Yvon, Propositions mathematiques de Monsieur de Laleu (1638); copy at the Bibliothèque nationale, Rés. gV 429; and the Bibliothèque Mazarine.

He was horrified to learn that the monarch had later sent the pre-cious vessel without hesitation to the smelting furnace.35Yvon’s symbolic construction of the Temple of Peace is only attested in a third, literary depiction, which he printed in La Rochelle in 1632 on top of a pamphlet titled ‘To the Jews and the ancient People of Israel, who are dispersed on the terrestrial and aquatic globe’.36 This global proselytist call, which even counted to convert eventual submarine Jewish populations, invited the Jewish sages to join construction work on the eschatological Temple.2 Judeo-Christianity, Messianism, SyncretismYvon’s call to the “rabbis” could not, of course, hope to find such an audience in France where, from 1394 until the Revolution, the practice and confession of the Jewish religion was outlawed. Clandestine Judaism could be punished by expulsion or, if the culprit was an apostate from Christianity, by the death penalty. The largest persecution that French authorities organized against se-cret Jews during these centuries took place in Rouen, in January 1633, when an entire community of Portuguese merchants was accused of apostasy by the Parliamentary tribunal. Their homes were searched immediately for suspi-cious religious objects, but only one seemingly Jewish item came to light, a piece of writing that contained Hebrew letters. Was this ‘perhaps a scroll of the Law’, as Cecil Roth surmised?37 Or was it ‘probably a Pentateuch or a Bible’ as Haim Beinart supposes?38 When checking the sources on the trial, which are kept in Brussels, the mysterious Hebrew document might be identified39 with a certain, I quote, figure de mathematique auecq quelques discours, imprimés de Paul Yuon de la Leu, ‘a mathematical drawing with some discourses, printed by 35 Tallemant, Historiettes, vol. ii, 556.36 [Yvon], Avx Ivifs et ancien pevple d’Israel, qui sont espars sur le Globe Terrestre & Aquaticq, from “The Temple of La Rochelle”, Dec. 25, 1632 (Bibliothèque Mazarine, recueil 2776c, piece 6).37 Roth, ‘Les marranes à Rouen’, 129.38 Beinart, ‘Ha-‘înqwîzîsyah has-sefaradît’, 61, adding immediately that ‘this is the only real information on an object of essentially Jewish character’ found among the alleged Judaizers.39 Secondary literature sometimes distinguishes them: the “manuscript” was said to be in Portuguese, from the house of Diogo de Oliveira, and the Yvon treatise found in the house of João Pinto Delgado."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Wilke186<UN>Paul Yvon de Laleu’.40 For unknown reasons, the Christian mathematician was held in some esteem by the secret Jews of Rouen. His model of the Temple of Peace may have ‘given some comfort to the Marranos’, as Brigitte Bedos-Rezak speculates.41We have here some rare information about the transmission of Judeo- Christian syncretism from the proselytizing Christian kabbalist to the Por-tuguese Marranos, which gives a clue to a possible social context for Yvon’s esoteric productions. A contemporary, Henri Sauval, indeed considered that Yvon was himself ‘of Jewish religious conviction, learned but a bit evaporated’, and he treats him together with two Frenchmen of his time who were eager to found a similar Judeo-Christian church, namely Isaac Lapeyrère (1595–1676) and Nicolas Charpy de Sainte Croix (1610–1670).42 As did the two of these, he planned his Temple of Peace not only as a geometric fantasy, but also as a real building, which would be free of sacred images and only teach general and universal articles of faith, in which Jews and Christians could fraternize.43In the same way as Isaac Lapeyrère, another Calvinist apostate, Yvon be-lieved that the king of France would inherit the Ottoman Sultan’s domains. Paris would become the ‘capital of the Oriental Empire’, which would allow a return of the Jews to the Promised Land. As Yvon announced to the terrestrial and submarine Jews, the French king would play the role of a Cyrus, take up world domination, and initiate the Jubilee or millennium period of the eternal Gospel, in which all evil is definitively vanquished, spirit and body brought into perfect “marriage”. His conception calls to mind the Joachimist visions of the two stages of the Law and the Gospel followed by a third stage of spiritual liberty, signifying a new way of religious and scientific understanding.44Yvon defended this new way shown by geometry in a provocative man-ner and is said to have published in 1638 a “Letter to Emperors, Kings, Princes and Potentates of the Earth”, in which he claimed to be the Messiah and the 40 Brussels, Archives Royales, Office Fiscal de Brabant, liasse 924bis, fol. 42r, published by Roth, art. cit.; cf.

Tallemant hinted at the persecution by the pastors as the real reason for his apostasy and supposed a certain degree of opportunism; ‘he turned Catholic, or at least he confessed the religion of the monarch’.46 In fact, Yvon wanted to follow his own ideas. And when Sébastien Hardy did his best to heap ridicule upon Yvon’s geometry, ‘the secret of which consists, it seems, in its blindness’, he caricatured his religious system as an unbridled universal syncretism integrating not only Judaism into the Christian dogma, but even the most exotic religious systems of Eastern Asia and pre-Hispanic America. ‘This Law [of the Spirit], the precursor of which he seems to want to be, overshadows all articles of the credo spread from Raków town [the center of the Polish unitarians], embraces the Mosaic and the Islamic faith, the sects of Confucius, Toticu [Tao-Te-King], Lauzu [Lao-Tse], Guitaa [Bhaga-vadgita], Ramah, Yupangui and Iscoalt [Ixcoatl], harmonizing all the opposites in a new way that not even Guillaume Postel would have dreamt of ’.47As did most esoteric thinkers, Yvon despised or at least disregarded dogmat-ic borderlines. In his letter to the Jews, he claimed to have mastered the task of uniting the two existing scientific models, that is, pagan natural science and Jewish exegetical speculation, on the basis of Catholic theology. He believed in a God hidden in the infernal center of the earth and under the sea, a God that should be adored in silence, by bowing down in spirit until the depth of the abyss.48 In his scientific ideas, Yvon was a mathematical mystic, who believed in the imminent ‘end of all science acquired by help of a medium’ and the dawning of an age of naturally infused knowledge which he read in Jeremiah 31.49 Mystical intuition and scientific evidence went entwined,50 as would be the case in Spinoza’s “third way” of knowledge obtained by evidence and more geometrico.45 Lettre aux Empereurs Rois Princes potentats de la Terre, mentioned by Tallemant, Histori-ettes, 556; and Sauval, fol. 78r.46 Tallemant, Historiettes, 557.47 Refutation d’un libelle imprimé à Rouen (Paris, 1643), copy in Bibliothèque nationale de France, imprimés, Vz 1045; see also Secret, ‘Notes’, 84.48 Yvon, Propositions mathematiques, in: Matton, Le Discours, 23.49 [Yvon], Lettre de Monsieur de Laleu, Escrite à Monsieur de Lozières son Fils, from Mossidun, September 27, 1632 (Bibliothèque Mazarine, 4.554a pièce 3).50 Goldstein, L’Europe mathématique."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Wilke188<UN>In spite of his seemingly hopeless marginality, Yvon’s interest resides in this conscious pursuit of a coincidencia oppositorum between currents that histo-riography is used to attribute to distinct contexts. The Rouen affair shows a point of contact between the declining Christian Kabbala and the apparition of a crypto-Judaic community in France. As to the manifold Christian uses of Jewish traditions in the early modern era, Paul Yvon blended the Hebraism of his Protestant upbringing with a millenarian tradition in the Catholic vein of Joachim of Fiore and Guillaume Postel. His political outlook and activity shows millenarian theology and French absolutist politics closely linked. He simultaneously proclaimed a Judeo-Christian millennium and a mathematic-scientific revolution. Paul Yvon indeed, wanted to bring it about all at once: the squaring of the circle, the restitution of the world to its original innocence be-fore Adam’s fall, French world hegemony, and the conversion of the Jews. Still his curious case would not have merited a place in the history of early modern iconic culture, had he not proposed a synthesis between text and image in a strikingly original manner.3 The Etchings(a) Circulum Quadrandi (1619). Four of Paul Yvon’s six known publications con-tain complex mathematical diagrams that acquire a formal and semantic den-sity through the incorporation of French and Hebrew inscriptions. Instead of real images, as Robert Fludd (1574–1637) and Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) developed them at the time, Yvon’s esotericism used the meanings of numbers, the associations evoked by geometric figures, the form and the sense of Hebrew letters, by combining all these elements in a peculiar way. Geometrical figures and Hebrew letters interpret each other, French explanations or Biblical refer-ences explain the Hebrew words, and the latter enter into two- dimensional text constellations through a typographic presentation as crosswords and the systematic exploration of their anagrams.We possess close to twenty etchings of this kind, published over a time of twenty years between 1619 and 1638. His first etching, included in his initial mathematical publication, already contains a Hebrew element. The three words, awfully mistreated in the first edition, “David, Noah, אבן (Even - stone)”, appear with the messianic reference of Isaiah 42 and the French lily.51 The three names refer possibly to the founders of monarchy, divine covenant and 51 Circulum quadrandi, et cubum duplicandi modus verus, a nemine hactenus mortalium cog-nitus (1619)."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"189Where Geometry Meets Kabbalah<UN>the church, as “stone” and “Peter” are both pierre in French: a pun already de-veloped in the Five Books of Hieroglyphics by the royal preacher Pierre Dinet.52(b) Letter to the Jews (December 1632). Yvon’s 1632 conversionist tract ad-dressed “To the Jews and Ancient People of Israel, Who Are Dispersed on the Terrestrial and Aquatic Globe” does not contain any geometrical etchings, but uses in various instances Hebrew crosswords as a vehicle of his eschatological ideas closely following the Trinitarian myth.The tract’s preamble opens with an elaborate series of three double cross-es that should represent the architecture of Yvon’s imaginary Peace Temple (Fig. 8.1). The upper level clearly describes the Trinity, as its crosses name God, Christ and Spirit, respectively: אלי (Eli - my God) on the left forms a cross with שלש (shalosh - three). רוח (Ruah - spirit) in the middle is entwined with עשו Esau and with רבע (reva’ - quarter, square, four). On the right, the Hebrew word משח (mashiah - anointed, i.e., Christ, in the Christian reading) appears twice, forming an anagram of חמש (hamesh - five). Inside the angles of the cross, there are smaller letters that can obliquely be read as ויד (Yo d) and, again, as יונ (Yavan). By linking the divine persons to numerical values, Yvon establishes the progression that he was so much interested in. On the lower level of the crosses, the crosses of Christ and God are linked by the composite concept מלך יהודים (melekh yehudim - King of the Jews), and the central cross of the Holy Spirit cross on its lower level unites the words רום (Rum - excellence, or Rome) and יון (Yavan - Greece, or the author’s own name).On top of the letter’s main part, Yvon introduced the crossword that he found most compelling, and to which he attributed an immediate persuasive 52 Dinet, Cinq livres des hiéroglyphes (1614); see Secret, Kabbalistes, 349.Figure 8.1Hebrew Crossword, Paul Yvon, Letter to the Jews (December 1632)"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Wilke190<UN>impact upon his Jewish reader (Fig. 8.2). Integrating mythic images of sexual duality, the crossword was formed from the words נחש (nahash - snake), and רחם (rehem - womb), opposing thus an object with a phallic connotation to the Hebrew term of the internal female genitalia. The conjunction of nahash and rehem occurs in an apocalyptic myth of the Zohar, where the bite of a snake, a symbol of the eschatological calamities, has to open the Shekhina’s womb so that she can give birth to redemption.53 Yvon explains the metaphor of sexual conjunction with regard to the unification of Christians and Jews in his Peace Temple: ‘the Christian Church, Abraham’s seed of the masculine spirit, desires to beget good seminal fruit in the feminine flesh,’ by which designation the “Jewish race” is understood.

In the middle between both crosses, קדש kadosh (holy) on the ec-clesiastical side meets an ambiguous word that can be read as שפט shafat (to judge) or as טפש tipesh (foolish). And after elaborating such Hebrew codes for his Trinitarian cosmology, the merger of the Jewish and the Catholic churches, his messianic vision and his ideal theocracy, Yvon finally signs his letter with a new series of crosswords, all involving different Hebraizations of his name. Yvon furthermore hints at his Calvinist background by signing as “the former Muslim” (l’ancien Sarrazin),55 obviously using the predestination doctrine as a basis of comparison between the two religions.(c) Letter to Father Anastaze (1634). To the Capuchin Father Anastaze by whom he had been initiated to Catholicism, Yvon wrote in 1634 a description of his conversion and added a mathematical defense of his circle squaring op-erations.56 Without much explicit link to the text, he filled the margins with no fewer than eight small geometric-kabbalistic figures, distinguished by the letters A to H.Figure A (Fig. 8.3) exemplifies the anthropomorphic character Yvon gave to some of his mathematic drawings. He apparently drew a geometrical bust portrait of himself by inscribing a semi-circle into the lower and a full circle into the upper half of the square, by marking acute angles from the center of the bottom line upwards and by placing a small semi-circle over the center of the diagram as if to indicate a long pointed beard with a mustache. The exact cen-ter of the diagram, which thereby receives the place of the mouth in this cub-ist face, displays a Hebrew crossword made up by the three-letter words שמש (shemesh - sun) and שמן (shemen - oil). While the sun is the Christian symbol of the Messiah, oil has a distinguished place in the eschatological imagery of Joachim of Fiore (c.1135–1202), who divided human history into the past age of Law, symbolized by water, the present age of Grace, symbolized by wine, and the future age of Liberty, symbolized by oil.57In Figure B (Fig. 8.4), the text and the diagram are not linked by pictorial means, but through a correspondence established between Biblical genealogy and numerical sequences.

The center is surrounded by a halo of four Hebrew letters שילו (shilo), probably a misspelt reflection of the reference to Shiloh in Genesis 49:10. The small circle in the very center is occupied by a French crossword placing the verb est (it is) in the middle, surrounded by néant (nothingness). In a letter written to Mersenne in August 1635, Yvon defends his idea that the only certainly intelligible object is “being” or rather the word “is”.63 In his Propositions of 1638, Yvon praises “be-ing” as the infinite and undefined origin of all existing things, more real than reality, the highest object of human knowledge.64 The intuitive perception of being that Yvon depicts on this 1634 etching, may sound like an antithesis to the cogito that Descartes would formulate in 1637; it is most probably influ-enced by speculations on the middle ground between being and nothing that Jacques Gaffarel (1601–1681) formulated at the same period.65Figure L (Fig. 8.9) contains a sequence of letters, פלארםיון, in which one can read Paul Yvon’s name in the form he cherished, namely as pele rum yavan (“Paul, Rome, Greece”, or “miracle of exalted Greece”). The cross below, formed by the Hebrew letters ח (het), ו (vav), ר (resh), and ב (bet) is not clearly readable. The letters can form the words חור (hor - hole), חבר (haver - companion) and, as a crossword with the upper line, רוח (ruah - spirit), which is the anagram of hor. The place of the cross between the two semi-circles might again hint at a possible anthropomorphic interpretation of the diagram, but in this case, it would not show a man’s bearded head, but a woman from a viewpoint simi-lar to that which Gustave Courbet would adopt for his painting The Origin of the World (1866). Such an association would indeed fit into the eschatological imagery of “snake” and “womb” that this writer-drawer-mathematician had de-veloped in his call to the Jews. However sexually inactive he may have been, he was certainly not sexually indifferent. For Yvon, the mythical and theological significance he gave to geometrical figures also included the idea that divine powers and mathematic forms had genders and could generate one another. Figure F in the letter to Father Anastaze could thus invoke an ‘infinite genera-tion of proportional lines’ upon which Yvon hoped to base his circle squaring.63 Mersenne, Correspondance, vol. v, 365–367.64 Yvon, Propositions mathematiques, in: Matton, Le Discours, 21–22.65 Gaffarel, Nihil fere nihil, minus nihilo, (1634); copy Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, R 54785."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"199Where Geometry Meets Kabbalah<UN>(d) Mathematical Propositions (1638). The two sexual symbols of the snake and the womb, which Yvon had united in a Hebrew crossword in 1632, are also the basis for those of his drawings that come closest to pictorial presentation. They form part of the seven etchings that accompany his Mathematical Propositions of 1638 and insist in its rhymed French inscriptions again on nature’s imma-nent unity. On one of them can be read: ‘The eternal work of the Almighty is natural and all-embracing’. Elias, the messenger of the future, and Azazel, the demon of the past, here guarantee in their cooperation the mathematical bal-ance that Yvon endeavored to create.On the etching called “The Chastising Rod” (La Verge castigante, Fig. 8.10), a sort of cross in the form of the number 8 is composed of a sword and two snakes.

As Yvon explained to Fa-ther Anastaze, he used the lily to mark the only fixed spot in the permanent movement of the universe and the monarchy. The Hebrew inscription at the bottom of the page reads איש (ish - Man) אמנואל (Immanuel), two names of Christ, but a change in the initial guttural has produced a feminist turn, as the word immanu El, “God is with us”, has now become immenu El, “God is our Mother”.Figure 8.10 Chastising Rod, Paul Yvon, Mathematical Propositions (1638)"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"201Where Geometry Meets Kabbalah<UN>The second etching (Fig. 8.11) has the central inscription “The Savior has di-vinely opened the merciful womb of the intelligible world” and develops the feminine side of Yvon’s genital imagery. With a Biblical quotation at the bot-tom line, ‘It is good to hide a king’s secret, but it is honorable to reveal God’s works’ (Tobit 12:7), Yvon atones for his representation of a globe in which there opens a vagina and over which hovers a large cross made of Hebrew letters. The vertical line of the cross evokes “Tsadok” and “King”, the highest hori-zontal line reproduces the kabbalist levels of the soul (chayah, nefesh, ruah, neshamah), plus the word “holy” (kadosh) the second has the French rhyme ‘This is a celestial work and a manifest miracle, accomplished by the God of Figure 8.11 Nicodeme, Paul Yvon, Mathematical Propositions (1638)"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Wilke202<UN>Gods, which is present at our sight.’66 The third line refers on the left side to the Crucifixion, on the right side, to the crypto-Christian Jew Nicodemus, whose name is explained as “Victory of the People”, but also transcribed in Hebrew, so that it resembles the Hebrew word nikud, the term for the geometrical “point”. The Fourth line presents the miraculous first birth of Esau and of Jesus, whose names are again treated as anagrams of each other.Inside the vagina, identified with the vesica piscis in Yvon’s geometry, we find the familiar crossword of “Snake” and “Womb”. The French word est, “is”, is many times repeated on the globe’s periphery, with reference to messianic prophecies in Isaiah and Esdras. Four Hebrew crosswords inside the globe link Three with Thousand, Man with Being, isha (woman) with Yishay ( Jessé, the Messiah’s ancestor) and Greece with Yvon. Yvon’s celebration of being as his new divinity concatenates creation with understanding: on the right and the left of the labia he inscribed the words תבל (tevel - world), and שכל (sekhel - understanding). As he asserted repeatedly, the artificial language only reflects its objects; the natural language conceives and creates them in the way they are. The latter is operative, the former only significative.674 ConclusionChristophe Villiers, one of the mathematicians who most opposed Paul Yvon’s “cabbalistic and hypermetaphysical”68 way of reasoning, mirrored the latter’s gendered imagery when he mockingly stated that Yvon had “rather conceived than begotten” his theorems.69 Yvon is thus said to have been overwhelmed by his esoteric readings to the point of effeminacy.Yvon’s esoteric numerological doctrines are, with all their confusing ele-ments, parts of a Judeo-Christian syncretism that had been well established in French Catholic thought since the time of Guillaume Postel. Villiers rec-ognized correctly a line of mystical thought eager to blur borders between 66 ‘Cecy est une oeuvre celeste et un miracle manifeste, Faite pour vray du Dieu des Dieux, lequel se présente à nos yeux’.67 Mersenne, Correspondance, vol. v, 366; Matton, Le Discours, 22.68 Mersenne, Correspondance, vol. xi, 175.69 Mersenne, Correspondance, vol. iii, 189, June 20, 1634: ‘Le Sr de Laleu s’accuse plus qu’il ne se defend et qu’il veut faire paroistre son sçavoir estre cabalistique ou revelé qui n’est fondé pourtant sur aucun principe asseuré que d’une imaginaire revelation.

But a personal spacial and iconic symbolism, combined with the ambiguous codes of the He-brew language, was Yvon’s main contribution and his major tool in expressing his immanentist message. By constantly moving between the theological and the mathematical level of meaning, by using Hebrew words with several, even contradictory meanings obtained by anagrammatic use and crossword com-bination and finally by bringing them into geometrical form, Yvon fitted the most diverse ideas into his multi-dimensional spatial constructions of meta-physical realities.Kabbalistic name-dropping, mathematic calculation, examples of cubist art avant la lettre and other such devices create in their combined effect a visual complexity akin to Baroque religious painting, which, however, still obeys a strong iconoclast discipline, certainly inherited from Yvon’s Calvinist past and his imaginary or real Jewish audience. A search for metaphysical purity lets him adhere quite strictly to the abstract pictorial languages of geometry and the Hebrew alphabet. But his ascetic imagery paradoxically leads him to ac-complish some of the most grossly provocative gestures of visual representa-tion, including sexual exhibition and self-portrayal as a part, indeed a very pri-vate part, of the immanent divinity.BibliographyAnchel, Robert, Les juifs de France, Paris: J.-B.

Swedenborg repeatedly says that Jewish form of worship is external and even if the religion of the Jews is symbolical of the Divine they lack what he calls an internal sense. With such a negative assessment of the Jewish tradition, Hanegraaff consid-ers it most unlikely that Swedenborg would regard important anything of the 1 Pacheco, Visionary Consciousness, 59–67.2 Moshe Idel in a Hebrew article of 1986, ‘The World of Angels in Human Form’, 64–66, claims that the structure of Swedenborg’s angelic world in human form may have been influenced by Kabbalistic writings, as Roling records, see note 6 below. In Sweden for instance Duke Charles of Suderomannia in the 1780s depicts the Sephirotic Tree coordinated with the hu-man organs; for Swedenborg and the Grand human coordinated to the human organs see Swedenborg’s Arcana Coelestia 4302: 3 and Heaven and Hell 94, 100, 65–66.3 Stengel, ‘Swedenborg als Rationalist’.

It is a work by the Hebraist at Uppsala University, Daniel Lundius (1666–1747), treating of the wisdom of Solomon, Dissertatio historico-philologico de sapientia Salomonis (A Historico-Philological Disserta-tion on the Wisdom of Solomon, Uppsala, 1705). Here, Kabbalist ideas are dis-cussed in broad terms. Apparently, Swedenborg acquired the dissertation as a young student in Uppsala where he was living with his brother-in-law, Eric Benzelius, a linguist specializing in Hebrew and Greek.7 The respondent of the dissertation, Fredericus Swab, defended it publically and may even have been a fellow student of Emanuel, who was still named Svedberg, thus not yet ennobled.In De sapientia Salomonis, Lundius shows that the Kabbalists through con-templating the ten sephiroth wanted to restore the Divine light of wisdom that formerly had reigned with Adam and King Solomon. The tract contains a few, but important, observations on the Sefer Yetzira – Book of Formation and on how ‘the ancient Jewish philosophers called this light sepho Elohim – Divine influx (influxum Divinum).’8 Further, that the Kabbalist ‘sephira Chokma (wis-dom) was used by their pious men to inwardly perceive the secrets of God (arcana Dei),’ in order to be led to act righteously.9Lundius goes on to say that the Jews maintain that the Divine channels from the upper worlds were broken with the fall of Adam so that full illumination 4 Hanegraaff, ‘Swedenborg, the Jews and the Jewish Tradition’, esp. 154.5 Ibid., 146 n. 36 and Stengel (2008), 184 n. 210 citing Schuchard, ‘Swedenborg, Jacobitism and Freemasonry’.6 Roling, ‘Erlösung in angelischen Makrokosmos’.7 Emanuel’s father, Bishop Jesper Svedberg, was also a Hebraist and interested in linguistic problems as seen in his work on the Swedish language that he entitled, Schibboleth.8 Lundius (1705), 6, ‘Hoc lumen antiqui Judaeorum Philosophi “sepho Elohim” influxum Divi-num vocarunt.’9 Ibid., 8, ‘...ex sephira Chokma et quod per eas viri pii arcana Dei introspiciunt.’ See also 13–14."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Åkerman-Hjern208<UN>can no longer reach the lower regions – only with the coming of the Messiah will these channels (canales) be restored.10 These observations are referenced by Johannes Reuchlin’s De arte cabalistica (On the Cabalistic Art, 1517) quoting R. Joseph Gikatilla’s Sha’ are orah, the Gates of Light, known for having been printed in Latin by Paulus Riccius as Portae lucis (Augsburg, 1516), with its il-lustration of the Sephirotic tree held in the hand of a contemplative Kabbalist. Lundius even mentions Hebrew highlights such as maaseh bereshith (account of creation) and maaseh mercabah (account of the chariot) commenting on the vision of Ezechiel, central themes within contemplative Kabbalah.11 In a lengthy passage, Solomon’s wisdom is shown to be paramount in his influence over the Queen of Sheba and it is pointed out that his skill involved invok-ing (and exorcising) spirits.12 The final note of the dissertation is however that while the wisdom of Solomon contains much for the enlightened heart and for understanding the virtues of kings, it also sets magic and relations with de-mons within reach.13 De sapientia Salomonis is basically a positive view of the Jewish Kabbalah, comparing it somewhat to Greek views and with a conclud-ing warning against its negative use.Swedenborg thus appears to have been familiar early on with broad descrip-tions of the Kabbalah from the point of view of Lutheran Old Testament stud-ies. The dissertation is indicative of the theological milieu at Uppsala where Zohar studies was fostered by Eric Benzelius, who in 1697 had invited a kabbal-ist and Jewish convert to Christianity, Johann Kemper (1670–1716), to settle and teach Hebrew there. While at Uppsala, Kemper wrote extensive commentaries trying to show that the Trinity was compatible with the Kabbalist tradition, showing Christ as the divinity of the Messiah and the role of the angel Meta-tron. Elliot R. Wolfson has recently shown just how original Kemper’s Hebrew treatises are and it is clear that the Jewish Hebrew teacher must have been a well known figure in the university town.14 Also, Benzelius owned and has himself signed the collection of manuscript notes on Kabbalist and mystical literature, entitled Cabalistica, written by the seventeenth-century Swedish 10 Ibid., 7–8, For Reuchlin see also 3.11 Ibid., 30.

He clearly was to transform these influences into his own version of cosmology, achieved after many years of scientific work. Eberhard Zwink has pointed out how the geometric creation story of Swedenborg’s Principia rerum naturalium (The First Principles of Natural Things, 1734) can be likened to the Kabbalah. The set-ting out of a single point (nexus) seen as Christ binding infinity to the finite is similar to the infinite light (Or Ein-soph) descending from the unlimited into the finite world, as set out by the Jewish mystics.19 The geometric process can, however, also be gained from Proclus’ commentary on Euclid and the early Swedenborg prefers to call the nexus the zenonian point, finitely small.20 The Kabbalah itself is, of course, pace Scholem, influenced by neo-Platonism and the similarity may originate from this genealogy. Swedenborg might, however, have been aware of their parallel since he says in the Principia:In a word that the first ens as well as all other entities in successive deriva-tion from it, of which the world is composed, and by which it is connected 15 Ms. N 24, Linköpings Stiftsbibliotek.16 Ibid., f. 35.17 Roling (2008), passim.18 The Conway Letters, 390. More tells of how in 1674, Gezelius is presented with “Peganius his designe”, i.e., Christian Knorr von Rosenroth’s publication of the Zohar, later pub-lished as Kabbala denudata.19 Zwink, ‘Shrauben-förmige Bewegung ist in allem’.20 Swedenborg, The Principia, or First Principles of Natural Things, Vol. i, 51.

Another important theme in the Principia is the idea of a man of integrity, whose ‘ven-eration of the Deity was of equal extent as his wisdom and as constant as the operation of his senses’, described towards the end of the first chapter. When the connection to the Divine is disrupted, however, the man is no longer in a state of integrity, but he might restore a connection with the Infinite by being in likeness with the Lord.22 These states of Adam are further laid out in The Worship and Love of God (1745) where in § 55 the Tree of Paradise appears in the context of human understanding. A striking aspect in the Writings, paral-lel to the divine light of the Kabbalah, is the manifold descriptions of light as either confirming or illuminating the visionary in his quest for truth. Sweden-borg constantly speaks about how the appearance of things is altered when they are perceived in the light of heaven. In Worship and Love of God, the light also confirms Eve in her suppositions about Divine knowledge.23 Out of the Word in its natural sense shines forth the inner sense: Truth shines forth with spiritual light like a diamond, while Good shines forth with a celestial flame like a ruby.24In his Philosophical Notebook of 1741, Swedenborg takes notes from his read-ings and in a significant paragraph from Leibniz’s Theodicy (1710) he jots down the idea that the cutting off of Malkuth – the lowest and divinely feminine emanation of light called the “Kingdom” on the Tree of Life – from the other sephiroth is a sin and to restore it one needs the Messiah.25 This note could be taken as a scant and feeble knowledge of the Kabbalah, but one can just as well recognize that he is not learning something entirely new, but that he notices 21 Swedenborg, Principles, 47. Of course, Genesis does not speak of the Infinite, but of bereshith, in the beginning...22 Ibid., 43ff.23 I thank Stuart Shotwell, translator of De cultu et amore Dei, for these observations.24 Swedenborg, The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, 42.25 Swedenborg, A Philosopher’s Notebook. Swedenborg also notes two more, less distinct, Kabbalist notions, on the World Soul and the Messiah, see PhN 160, 250, 379. (Codex 36)."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"211Emanuel Swedenborg and the Kabbalah<UN>something he knows the context of already. Swedenborg’s central record of revelations Arcana coelestia (Heavenly Secrets, 1749) is a commentary on Gen-esis and Exodus where inner meanings are explained by correspondence: each person, object, or fact, is found to correspond to an inner spiritual state. In later writings Swedenborg found that the entire Word (Bible text) speaks in its inner sense of the Lord, of regeneration, the Church and the coming New Jeru-salem.26 He therefore wrote his last work Coronis (1770) treating of the condi-tions for the periodical rise, flourishing, and decline of the churches, until the final one is established. In this crowning New Church (Nova ecclesia) he found a meaning that would not retain the literal meaning of the Bible texts: instead of the redemption of Israel, he saw in them the universal salvation of mankind. Similar to the Kabbalah, however, is the emphasis on the ultimate regeneration of the reader, or contemplative thinker, faced with this inner meaning.Now, it has been observed that Swedenborg uses the form of midrash in his works of commentary to the Bible texts.27 His aim always is to elucidate them by pointing to spiritual meanings hidden in between the lines. Swedenborg can be seen to have tried to spiritualize the exactness of the Latin language in order to retrieve the inner meaning of the Bible texts, transforming them into a revealed Latin Word. Divine revelation has otherwise come down to us through the medium of the Semitic languages. Kabbalists and Sufis could perceive a multitude of connections between words, not by similarity of se-mantic meaning, but by the multiple connotations given when focusing on the unpunctuated stems and numerical values for each word in either Hebrew or Arabic. The factor at play in Semitic languages is that there are many more semantic connections among roots and stems than in Latin. Arabic, as is often pointed out, is especially apt for poetry, as with the Sufi poet Ibn Arabi, while Latin has become a medium for strict definitions, something Swedenborg tried to change by opening up for inner meanings in the Latin translations of the Scriptures.28 As a Latin poet from an early age he was skilled in seeing seman-tic possibilities. Hebrew letters, on the other hand, are always seen by him as eminently divine and superbly able to express heavenly qualities.29 In Arcana 26 Rose, Swedenborg’s Garden of Theology.27 Pacheco (2000), Cf. Corbin, Swedenborg and Esoteric Islam.28 Åkerman, ‘Books of Splendour: Swedenborg and Gustaf Bonde’s Esoteric Library’. How-ever, as Stuart Shotwell points out, Swedenborg’s Latin is often so literal, a pure Hebrew calque, that it cannot be understood without reference to its Hebrew original.29 Cf. Katz, God’s Last Words, 345, citing True Christian Religion, 191, 201–205, 275. Inge Jons-son in his Swedenborgs Korrespondenslära, shows that these passages are derived from Swedenborg’s reading of his contemporary Caspar Neuman’s Clavis domus heber that"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Åkerman-Hjern212<UN>coelestia he often holds forth that the angels can see an inner sense in every tittle and jot of the Hebrew Word. Since the Bible text is to be held in absolute sanctity, any apparent contradiction or absurdity in its literal sense indicates to the Kabbalists that there is a quite other mystical meaning contained in it. Also for Swedenborg in his Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, 1763), sur-face contradictions or absurdities in the literal sense of the Word point to the deeper layer of an inner sense.To conclude, Swedenborg appears to have been in part familiar with Jewish mystical ideas and there is a soft, but definite, influence from Kabbalah on his thinking. We thus might begin to see resemblances between the Writings and Kabbalist notions.30 Examples from the WritingsThere are elements and structures in Swedenborg’s thought that are familiar to Jewish mysticism, especially Swedenborg’s use of dual terms associated with gendered expressions, female and male: good and truth, love and wisdom, heart and lungs, warmth and light, all emanating from the Lord. The Conjugial Love (1768) contains passages that I believe have not only a biblical background, but a mystical meaning shared by the Kabbalah: cl 8 [5] and cl 42.1. The first of these describe the relations between love and wisdom and the influx from the higher levels of the mind into the lower levels:cl 8 [5] On hearing this they all asked: ‘What is the delight of the soul, and where does it come from?’ ‘The delight of the soul,’ the angel answered, ‘comes from love and wisdom under the Lord’s guidance. Since love is an effective agent and achieves its effect through wisdom, so both of these are present in the effect, and the effect is service. The Lord pours this delight into the soul, and it passes down through the higher and lower levels of the mind into all the bodily senses, where it reaches its fulfilment. That is what makes joy joy, and treats of the vowels in jehova, explaining the speech of angels as based on words build up either by the vowels aou or ie, spiritual and celestial.30 Åkerman, op. cit., showing that Swedenborg in 1762 visited Bonde’s castle with its library containing among other works Knorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbala denudata and Reuchlin’s De arte cabbalistica.

You have seen the gardens, and I assure you, there is nothing in them, not so much as a tiny leaf, which is not the product of the marriage of love and wisdom realised in service. So if anyone enjoys this, he is in the heavenly garden, and so in heaven.In the line ‘...since love is an effective agent and achieves its effect through wisdom’ (... quia amor est efficiens, et est efficiens per sapientiam...) we can sense a combination of the two sephiroth Chokma (wisdom) and Chesed (grace, love), yet set in a scientific frame of cause and effect. Love and Wisdom are thus divine emanations with causal effects even unto service and use. Sens-ing of emanations, however, is inevitably subjective.2. The second significant passage on how spirits are carried off to heaven and become angels, as when Elijah was being lifted up to heaven, comes from Earths in the Universe 82 and Arcana Coelestia 2762, 8029, where Elijah signifies the Word:eu 82. I was allowed to see what happens when spirits from that world are, once prepared, carried off to heaven and become angels. At these times chariots and horses are seen shining as if on fire, like those which carried off Elijah. The ap-pearance of chariots and horses shining as if on fire is because this is a picture of their being instructed and prepared for entering heaven. Chariots mean the teaching of the church, and shining horses the enlightened intellect...Since the Word is the source of all the church’s teaching and its understand-ing, Elijah was called ‘the chariots of Israel and his horsemen’ (ac 2762). He was therefore carried up by a chariot and horses of fire. (Chadwick transl.)3. The third passage reflects a chariot that comes down from the highest heaven with a couple in wedded love, a scene which appears strangely familiar, reminiscent of tales of merkabah mysticism (concerning the chariot in which one is transported to the throne of God). There are cor-respondences here between the heavenly chariot of conjugial love and the mystical chariot to the throne of light.cl 42. One morning I looked up into heaven and saw above me one broad level above another, and as I watched, the first level near to me was opened up, and then the second above, and finally the third, which was the highest. I was en-lightened by this so as to grasp that the angels forming the first or lowest heav-en were on the first level, those forming the second or middle heaven on the second level, and those forming the third or highest heaven on the third level."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Åkerman-Hjern214<UN>At first I wondered what this meant and why it so appeared; and then I heard a voice like the sound of a trumpet coming out of heaven, which said, ‘We have noticed and now see that you are meditating about conjugial love. We know that so far no one on earth knows what truly conjugial love is in its origin and essence, important though it is to know this. It has therefore pleased the Lord to open up the heavens to you, so that the light which enlightens may flow into the inner levels of your mind and allow you to perceive it. Our celestial delights in the heavens, especially the third, are chiefly from conjugial love. We have therefore been given permission to send down a married couple for you to see.’[2] Then suddenly there was to be seen a chariot coming down from the highest or third heaven, containing what seemed to be one angel. But as it approached, it seemed to have two angels in it. The chariot seen from afar sparkled like a diamond, and had harnessed to it foals as white as snow. The travellers riding in the chariot held in their hands two turtle-doves, and they called out to me, ‘You would like us to come closer, but be careful then that the fiery radiance, which is from the heaven we come down from, does not strike too deep. It will certainly enlighten the higher concepts in your intellect, which are in themselves heavenly. But these are inexpressible in the world where you now are. So understand rationally what you are about to hear, and so explain this to your intellect.’‘I will be careful,’ I replied, ‘come closer.’ They did so, and turned out to be a husband and wife. ‘We are a married couple,’ they said. ‘We have led a blessed life in heaven from the earliest time, which you call the Golden Age. We have been perpetually in the bloom of youth, in which you see us today.’[3] I gazed at them both, because I realised that in their life and their adorn-ment they were a picture of conjugial love. Their lives were to be seen from their faces, their adornment from their dress. For all angels are affections of love in human form. Their ruling affection shines out from their faces, and it is their affection which provides and determines what they wear. So in heaven there is a saying, everyone is dressed by his affection. The husband looked to be of an age half way between an adolescent and a young adult. Sparkling light glittered from his eyes, an effect of the wisdom of love; this light made his face shine with a kind of internal radiance, and this radiation made his skin shine on the outside, so that his whole face was a single lovely splendour. He was dressed in an ankle-length robe, over a blue garment with a gold belt, deco-rated with three gems, a sapphire at either side and a carbuncle at the centre. He wore stockings of shining linen with silver threads in the weave, and pure silk shoes. This was the picture presented by conjugial love in the husband.[4] In the wife it appeared like this. I saw her face and at the same time I did not see it. It looked like Beauty itself, but I could not see it because this is"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"215Emanuel Swedenborg and the Kabbalah<UN>inexpressible. Her face shone with fiery light, the light the angels in the third heaven enjoy, and this dazzled my sight, so that I was simply amazed. When she noticed this, she spoke to me. ‘What can you see?’ she asked. ‘I can see nothing but conjugial love and the form it takes,’ I answered. ‘But I both see and don’t see.’At this she turned sideways on to her husband, and then I could gaze at her more fixedly. Her eyes flashed with the light of her heaven, a fiery light, as I have said, which derives from the love of wisdom. For the love wives have for their husbands in that heaven comes from and is focussed on their wis-dom, and the love husbands have for their wives comes from and is focussed on that love for themselves, so that it unites them. As a result her beauty was such that no painter could ever rival it or render it in its true appearance, for his colours lack radiance and his art has no means to express her loveliness. Her hair was beautifully dressed in an arrangement which had a meaning by correspondence, and it had flowers in it made of jewelled settings. Her neck-lace was of carbuncles, and from it hung a rosary of gold-coloured gems, and she had pearl bracelets. She was dressed in a red gown over a purple blouse, fastened at the front with rubies. But I was surprised to see that the colours changed as she turned towards or away from her husband, and this too made them sparkle more or less, more when they looked at each other, less when not directly facing.[5] When I had seen this, they spoke with me again; and when the husband spoke, it was as if what he said came at the same time from the wife, and when the wife spoke, it was as if it came at the same time from her husband, so close-ly united were their minds, from which their utterances flowed. And I could also then hear the sound of conjugial love, which was in inward unison within their speech, and arose from the delights of a state of peace and innocence.At length they said, ‘We are being called back, we must go.’ Then they were seen again riding in a chariot, as before. They drove along a paved road be-tween flower-beds with olive-trees and trees laden with orange fruit springing from them. When they approached their own heaven, maidens came out to welcome them and escort them in. ( John Chadwick transl.)This is a very long quote, but serves a purpose. It is to point out that for Swedenborg the internal sense of the Word is out of a celestial origin, not out of a rational origin. Thus, Friedemann Stengel’s recent identification of Swe-denborg’s sources Aufklärung bis zum Himmel (Tübingen, 2011) has a problem-atic agenda. Stengel tries to explain by rational sources what in principle only can come out of heavenly perception. In the end, Stengel admits that he has found no sources (yet) for Swedenborg’s ideal of an omnipresent conjunction between the natural and spiritual intellect and the celestial level, the so called"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Åkerman-Hjern216<UN>conjugial love. I believe we can find such origins only in mystical experience and its tradition. Even while Swedenborg, as most philosophers of his time, does not refer to any sources, but says that heaven itself has been opened for him to see and to hear. We have to admit that in interpreting the Bible an ac-quaintance with Kabbalah, Hermetica, and Christian ideas of the inner and allegorical sense of the Bible had prepared Swedenborg to look for correspon-dences to reach the deeper structures of regeneration and glorification in Gen-esis and Exodus that were his main aim to make clear through his Writings. Early FollowersWhile events after Swedenborg’s demise cannot show that he was himself influenced by Kabbalah, it is interesting that Jewish mysticism at times was compared to his outlook. The combination of the Writings and Kabbalah is found among early followers of Swedenborg, among them the German parish priest at Tübingen, Friedrich Christoph Oetinger (1702–1782), who after analyz-ing Swedenborg’s system along with Kabbalah as its proper context, in the end was critical of the Swedish visionary. He claimed that Swedenborg in the Prin-cipia did not preserve the Great Chain of Being in his emphasis on geometri-cal contiguity in a series from the infinite to finite.31 In Sweden, Kabbalah was read in the circle of duke Charles of Suderomannia, who in the 1770s created a Sanctuary in Stockholm castle for Swedenborgian worship and spirit séances. As one can see in Kjell Lekeby’s edition of documents, Gustaviansk mystik, the sanctuary was decorated in Solomonic style:It was with such a holy purpose that he [the Prince] began to design a most secret place of worship for higher masonry, where a purified the-osophy would be set up in conjunction with the Old Testament prophets and Swedenborg’s New Jerusalem. The Sanctuary was built in the Prince’s own rooms into a summation of the ancient Temple of Solomon. In like-ness with the glorious house of God, the walls were covered with clear gold, but of artificial kinds. All vessels of sanctity and the decorations were either real or in their appearance golden. The light of day was not to enter into the Holy of Holies, which was lit by 36 wax candles. No one was let in without the direct call of the Holy spirit, through the wis-est of mouths [...] His clothing was in the most costly way cut out and 31 Oetinger, Swedenborgs irrdische und himmlische Philosophie, ‘Anhang von der Sephiroth oder Abglänzen der Herrlichkeit Gottes’, Vol. ii, 341.

Rid-derstad two decades later, also reported by Lekeby, built on interviews with concerned people and refers to the Christian Kabbalist decorations of Duke Charles’ temple walls – water and fire (aesch va majim) joined as Schamajim (Heaven) vibrating over the firmament:Further in, at the back of the room four pillars arose. The backdrop be-hind them was a veil or tapestry, which surprised by its shining colours, gleaming in celestial blue, purple, red and snow-white linen, which four colours would represent the four elements. The red signified fire, the lin-en earth, the celestial blue air and the purple the sea. When one parted the veil to the side, one came into the innermost of the Sanctuary. It was rather plain. Its only decoration was an altar, surrounded by steps, and above it the Cross of Christ.33If perhaps this was to go beyond the visions in the Writings, the design of the Stockholm Sanctuary shows that in the first generation after Swedenborg, Kab-balah, as the wisdom of Solomon, was considered near to, and compatible with, his general spiritual vision. Hence, in these circles, in 1786 a group of readers of the Writings was founded, the lively Exegetic-Philanthropical Society.34BibliographyÅkerman, Susanna, ‘Books of Splendour: Swedenborg and Gustaf Bonde’s Esoteric Library’, in: Gancheva, Vera (ed.), The 18th century and Europe, Sofia, 2013, 91–102.

Symbols and Mystical-Allegorical Exegesis in Emanuel Swedenborg’s De Cultu et Amore DeiFrancesca Maria Crasta and Laura Follesa1 Preliminary ConsiderationsAmong the numerous writings of the Swedish scientist, philosopher and visionary Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), De cultu et amore Dei (The Wor-ship and Love of God, 1745) appears to divide the author’s intellectual devel-opment and production in two phases, a “scientific” phase (1720–1745) and a “theosophical” one (1745–1772). It is a very complex work, especially from the philosophical and linguistic point of view, in which the author combines al-legorical visions and poetic-literary metaphors, drawn from both classical and modern canons, and symbolic structures that can be referred to a theological, mystical and esoteric background, and also many elements deriving from his previous scientific studies. For this reason, we can analyse this writing along different interpretative lines, in order to bind many different points of view into a single vision. The scientific elements play a predominant role, as they provide a solid structure to the Swedenborgian philosophical system of nature; the multitude of symbols, metaphors, allegories and metonymies contribute to create a very complex literary backdrop merging scientific topics with theolog-ical and philosophical themes. From this point of view, the work offers a case study to measure the function of these elements in a seventeenth-century context.Images such as the cosmic egg, the primordial state of nature, the Edenic tree of life and even the egg from which the first man Adam was born, are but a few examples of the many symbolic representations in this Swedenborgian work.2 They are ascribable, in general, to the esoteric tradition, but take on in 1 F.M. Crasta wrote the ‘Preliminary considerations’, the first paragraph (‘Mythical and mecha-nistic cosmogenesis’) and the ‘Final considerations’; L. Follesa wrote the second (‘Primordial forms of life’), the third (‘Transformation and metamorphosis’) and the fourth (‘Adam, the only-begotten’).2 Jonsson, A Drama of Creation, 3–68; Lamm, Emanuel Swedenborg, 160–194; Benz, Emanuel Swedenborg, 241–257."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"221The Arcanes of the World<UN>De cultu a heuristic, pedagogical and representative function. In a very particu-lar way, Swedenborg strives to weld these images to the scientific knowledge of his time, and this is what makes his work so peculiar. The origins of the distant past of the Earth and humanity do not only recall the literary topoi and myths of the collective imagination of the West; they take on an additional meaning with the new acquisitions of science.Through the employment of scientific knowledge, Swedenborgian descrip-tions address two levels of signification, one mythical-poetic and the other epistemological. He thus enables us to think about the question of the origins in naturalistic terms. This is particularly useful thanks to the adoption of a two-tiered logic: that of scientific explanations and that of thinking with images. In this way, different “alphabets” are effective in narrating the myths about the origin of the world and of life on earth, including also the birth of the primor-dial couple.From a chronological point of view, De cultu, published about a decade af-ter the publication of Opera philosophica et mineralia (1734), is a work of tran-sition. It was written between Swedenborg’s “naturalistic” period (Principia rerum naturalium, 1734; De Infinito, 1734; Oeconomia regni animalis, 1740–41; Regnum animale, 1744–45), and the further phase, where he researched a new form of spirituality, typical of works such as Arcana caelestia (1749–1756) or Vera christiana religio (1771).The main aim here is to analyse the presence, in the text of Swedenborg, of a double level of communication, poetical-literary on the one side and scientific on the other. The intention is to consider a few passages in the text where the intersection of the two approaches is evident and to show how scientific liter-ary tradition and innovation intertwine.One of the most meaningful symbols here is that of the cosmic egg, because it enables us to capture more explicitly the intersection between different in-terpretative lines. We shall analyse it at first within the cosmological discourse, namely in connection with the Cartesian mechanistic tradition; then, with re-gard to the complex of mythic traditions to which this symbol is related. From this second perspective the image will be studied also in connection with the generation of life and the birth of man, as an intermediate element between Infinite and finite, light and darkness.1 Mythical and Mechanistic CosmogenesisIn the De cultu, Swedenborg tries to add a poetic and visionary dimension to the cosmology of Cartesian vortexes, which he described in a previous work (Prin-cipia rerum naturalium, 1734), following the typical canons and expressions of"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Crasta and Follesa222<UN>the science of his time.3 The peculiarity of the De cultu is the reconstruction of the scene of the beginning of the world by uniting these two different modes of representation. If the Principia offered a scientific explanation of cosmogene-sis, broadly in line with Descartes and partly with Leibniz and Christian Wolff,4 in De cultu, we can find those same concepts expressed in a new language, made of images and symbolic representations. They recall in a very original way, as we shall see, ancient archetypes and symbolic codes.The transfer from the scientific point of view to that of the imagination has, as a consequence, the move towards a new logic of interpretation, based on inferences and the intersection between scientific methodus and poetry. A per-fect confluence and osmosis of languages realises this new explanatory mode and associates these different logics within a coherent system. The framework offered in the Principia is thus extended and enriched in a significant way.Let us look at an example of the correspondence between the scientific im-ages of the Principia and the symbolic images of De cultu. Take, for example, Tabula xxv of the Principia (Fig. 10.1), depicting the origin of the solar system, along with the magnetic spiral of Tabula iii (Fig. 10.2). These schemes repro-duce, according to Swedenborg, the concentration of stellar bodies around a central axis, or Milky Way.5These diagrams, taken from the Principia, correspond in the De cultu to a description full of symbols and allegorical meanings. The scene, however, has changed radically and a grandiose Baroque framework is set up in a poeti-cal form. What is now clear is the perfect correspondence between the natural and spiritual order. The natural Sun is the reflection of the divine or spiritual one: it requires a close relationship between the two worlds, the celestial and the natural. The function of the Sun – in analogy to that of other stars at the center of their vortexes – is no longer that described by Descartes, that is, the 3 Swedenborg, Principia rerum naturalium, 2 vols, 1734; English translation: The First Principles of Natural Things, Being New Attempts towards a Philosophical Explanation of the Elementary World, 1846, repr. 1976.4 During his youth, Swedenborg was deeply involved with the Cartesian tradition, especially as concerns its cosmological and physiological implications (he studied in particular Mal-ebranche and Boerhaave); later he referred to other philosophical traditions, especially to the Leibnitian-Wolffian one. Both in his published works and in manuscripts he often quot-ed and commented on Christian Wolff ’s writings, such as Philosophia prima, sive ontologia (1730), Cosmologia generalis (1731), and Elementa matheseos universae (1732).5 Swedenborg, Principia, pars iii, 376 (see the part of the Principia entitled Comparatio coeli stelliferi cum sphaera magnetica)."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"223The Arcanes of the World<UN>Figure 10.1 E.

It illuminates and nourishes them as if they were living beings. We can clearly note, at this stage, the transposition from the astronomical level of discourse to the biological one. This transition involves an expansion of meaning, with the inclusion of references to classical literary models, from Ovid’s Metamorphosis to Aristophanes’s The Birds.In the Principia Swedenborg referred to the motif of veteres philosophi (Epi-curus, Ovid, and Moses himself ), who suggested the existence of a “chaos” or “abyss” and primordial “darkness”,7 also quoting Aristophanes and his idea that, in the beginning, the Sun was enclosed within a shell, like an egg.8 Thus, the Principia already presented the image of the egg-primordium of life, which is further enhanced in De cultu.9 The idea of a continuous metamorphosis of forms is dominant, together with the idea of a continual development of natural bodies. Animate forms follow the inanimate ones, and go towards the spiritual state of the mind, in a progression constantly guided and supported by the strength of the natural heat of the spiritual Sun. Thus, all bodies of our system arise from the pregnancy of the Father-Sun. It is always the Sun, with its light and its rays, both natural and spiritual, which is supposed to provide parental care and to assist the planets that revolve around it, from their infancy until their old age.Let us now consider Tabula xxv of the Principia and compare figures 1 to 4 (depicting the formation of a sort of belt or crust around the Sun), with the De cultu, where Swedenborg describes the origin of the planets as a “birth” from the womb of the Sun and their slow but progressive distancing, almost like a weaning:There was, then, a time like no time, when the pregnant sun carried in his womb the gigantic brood of his own universe, and when, being delivered, he emitted them into the regions of air; for if they were derived from the sun, as a parent, it is manifest that they must have burst forth from his fruitful womb. Nevertheless, it was impossible that he could carry in his burning focus, and afterwards bring forth, such heavy and inert produc-tions, and therefore such burdens must have been the ultimate effects 6 Swedenborg, De cultu, §6.

Hence it follows, that the sun was primitively overspread with effluvia excited and hatched by his real irradiation, and flowing together in abundance and from every direction to him, as to an asylum and only harbor of rest; and that from those fluids, condensed in process of time, there existed a surrounding nebulous expanse, or a mass like the white of an egg, which, with the sun included in it, would resemble the Great Egg Of The Uni-verse; also that the surface of this egg could at length derive a crust, or a kind of shell, in consequence of the rays being intercepted, and their apertures shut up; and this crust, the sun, when the time of parturition was at hand, by his inward heat and agitation would burst and thereby hatch a numerous offspring, equal in number to the globes visible in his universe, which still look up to him as a parent. Something similar to this appears to take place both in the great and smaller subjects within the sphere of his world and of its three kingdoms on the earth, whether they be produced from the womb, from seed, or from an egg, for they are all only types effigied according to the idea of the greatest, and in themselves, although in a small effigy, resemble and emulate a kind of universe.10Even in the Principia we find a number of similar references to cosmogenesis, where the first natural points are created by the Infinite. The strength origi-nated by the Infinite passes, without interruption, from these points into the world of the finites, feeding a ‘feracissima et pariter ambitiosa’ (very fertile and likewise encompassing) nature, which continually desires to expand and develop more and more complex forms and aggregations.11Thus, if at the beginning the spiral motion is perfectly circular and fast, it subsequently slows down. The coils of the vortex start to tail off, giving rise to elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the focal points. They remind us of Ke-plerian ellipses, mainstay of the new astronomy, with their pythagorising and esoteric background and their connection to the symbolism of the egg. In this sense, also Swedenborgian spiral structures of the cosmos refer and are ideally linked to the oldest cosmogenesis.The spiral is, according to Swedenborg, a primordial form according to which all the parts of nature are disposed and connected through a single module, both at the microcosmic and macrocosmic level. This geometrical fig-ure, properly a typus, explains the macro-structures of galaxies, the fibers of 10 Swedenborg, De cultu, §9.11 Swedenborg, Principia, §1, 381."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Crasta and Follesa226<UN>our brain,12 the corpuscles of the magnet and the first elementary constituents of the world up to the metaphysical elements: it is the true origin of all the natural processes. In De cultu, this geometry corresponds to a more concrete form, namely that of the cosmic egg.The myth of the origins suggests once again the perfect shape of the egg-world, destined to corruption through time. Indeed, as soon as the distance from the Infinite increases, the original perfection departs and a gradual decay of the initial conditions of life begins on our planet. The eternal spring is lost and the cycle of seasons starts, while the “finites” continually rise and decay.13 These same themes are present in a vast repertoire that crosses Western cul-ture, starting from the ancient world and investing, in particular, the end of the sixteenth and the whole seventeenth century of Du Bartas’s La sepmaine (1578), Marin Mersenne’s Quaestiones in Genesim (1623), Ericius Puteanus’s Ovi encomium (1617), and Thomas Burnet’s Telluris theoria sacra (1681).14Swedenborg had already dealt with this question in his early writings, in the 1720s, where we can find, for example, the reference to Burnet’s Telluris theoria sacra. In 1734, Swedenborg quoted directly from the authors of the Golden Age, who perpetuated the memory of an ancient blissful time and the myth of the perfection of the origins, from Hesiod to Plato, from Virgil to Alcimus Avito.15 To Swedenborg, these quotations validate and accredit from a historical and literary point of view his hypothesis about cosmogenesis and represent a poetical and literary basis for the De cultu, despite the absence, in this writing, of a direct reference to them.2 Primordial Forms of LifeIn De cultu Swedenborg strongly drew on his knowledge of classical literature. In the first chapter of the work he describes the newly formed Earth, ejected, along with the other planets, from the womb of the Sun, as a virgin. She is preparing herself for the arrival of her future husband, Heaven, emblem of a 12 Swedenborg, Oeconomia, i, §141 ff.13 Swedenborg defines as “finites” the first particles or elements of the world. There are, in Swedenborg’s cosmology, many “degrees” of “finites” (finites of the first, the second and the third kind), from the combination of which originates the first “elementary particles” and thence all complex bodies of the natural world. On this topic and Swedenborg’s de-tailed description of originary particles see Crasta, La filosofia della natura, 176–207.14 As concerns Thomas Burnet’s Telluris theoria sacra, we find the 1791 edition in Swedenborg’s library (see Berquist, Swedenborg’s Secret, 469–482).15 See in particular Swedenborg, Principia, pt. iii, Chap. 12, 360–361."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"227The Arcanes of the World<UN>spiritual reality and bringer of life. The Earth’s surface is, according to the au-thor, such an ovary, prepared to welcome the lives of future species. The whole matter is concentrated here in order to give place to the three kingdoms. The Sun, father of all things, fertilises with its rays the myriad of eggs scattered in the womb of the Earth-mother. The complex process of life begins from this union between Heaven and Earth, namely, Sun-spirit and Earth-nature:This virgin and new-born earth, furnished with so becoming an aspect, now represented a kind of a new egg, but one laden with as many small eggs, or small seeds, collected at its surface, as were to be of its future triple kingdom, namely the mineral, the vegetable, and the animal. These seeds or beginnings lay as yet unseparated in their rudiments, one folded up in another, namely, the vegetable kingdom in the mineral kingdom, which was to be the matrix, and the animal kingdom in the vegetable kingdom, which was to serve as a nurse or nourisher; for each was after-wards to come forth distinctly from its covering.16The image of the seed takes over that of the cosmic egg: a shift in sense takes place, moving toward a biological sense, which was implicit or scarcely men-tioned in the Principia. While Swedenborg makes this semantic transition, he ideally refers to both ancient atomism, in the Leucippean and Democritean version, and the doctrine of “seeds”, qualitatively distinguishable, as described by Anaxagoras.17Swedenborg knew about atomism in its Epicurean version from Lucretius’s De rerum natura (On the nature of things), a work that has a leading role in the De cultu. Moreover, the Lucretian text represents a kind of paradigm for the merging of poetry with science. According to Lucretius, nothing is born from nothing by divine influence: the first elements of nature are the seeds, primor-dial particles of multiple forms, which are “solid and eternal” and responsible for the diversity of things.18 Furnished with interior movement, primordial seeds of things are “active” themselves, and for this reason they are the basis of 16 Swedenborg, De cultu, §15.17 See, for exemple, Swedenborg, Oeconomia regni animalis, i, 629.18 Lucretius, De rerum natura: ‘nulla rem e nilo gigni divinitus umquam’ (i, v. 150); ‘nunc seminibus quia certis quaeque creantur’ (i, v. 169); ‘solida atque aeterna’ (i, v. 627); ‘ figurarum tot nomina quot sunt, principiis, unde haec oritur variantia rerum’ (iii, vv. 317–318). On the incidence of Lucretius in Swedenborg, see also Jonsson, Drama of Cre-ation, 105–108."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Crasta and Follesa228<UN>all corporeal movements. They are similar to energy or power, which character-ises “primeval atoms”, furnishing an “impulse” for increasingly large bodies.19Lucretian atoms, similar to the “seminal reasons” (logoi spermatikoi) or seeds (spermata) of Stoic derivation, are indeed the primary elements from which all things will subsequently develop.20 The idea of a matter, animated from inside by a breath (pneuma), is implicit here. We will find this idea in the form of spiritus mundi or world soul, in the later Neoplatonic tradition. This complex of issues is clearly present in the De cultu, although here Swedenborg never talks about their derivation from ancient sources. However, his beginnings as a scholar of classical culture, his library, as well as the references to Greek phi-losophers, the Latin Fathers and the early Christians, which are scattered in his other works, demonstrate the connection with these old stereotypes.Swedenborg thus combines elements derived from the ancient pagan tradi-tion with the biblical narration of Genesis, to which he gives special implica-tions. The very idea that the three kingdoms of nature (including the mineral) originate from eggs or seeds profoundly transforms the biblical account and enriches with a great variety of meanings arising from both ancient and mod-ern-scientific culture.Instead of a God-Father (pantocrator), who creates in seven days all things from nothing, namely the light, the sky, the earth, the water, the plants, the animals and man, we find in the De cultu a God-Father-Sun, pregnant with the universe, who is giving life to the solar system. This is a model of creatio continua where a gradual development of forms produces the whole nature. There is an initial state when everything is pre-existing; then the universe starts developing, moved by an inner, divine, spiritual principle. The infancy of nature is represented by the “first living point” – as described in the Oeconomia regni animalis21 – and can be related to the stages of the emanative process de-scribed by Plotinus’s Enneads.22 In the case of De cultu, there is an analogy be-tween this process and the natural pregnancy, as the production of new forms of existence and life is similar to the way in which the Sun sends out planets from “his” womb.19 Lucretius, De rerum natura: ‘prima moventur enim per se primordia rerum; inde ea quae parvo sunt corpora conciliatu, et quasi proxima sunt ad viris principiorum, ictibus illo-rum caecis impulsa cientur, ipsaque proporro paulo maiora lacessunt’ (ii, vv. 133–137).20 On ancient Stoics see Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta. See also Reale, The System of the Hellenistic Age, 185–258.21 On the first living point, see Swedenborg, Oeconomia, i, §§247, 248, 253.22 See Plotinus, Enneads, v (iv, 2)."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"229The Arcanes of the World<UN>A process of biological development regulates the maturation of eggs or small seeds on the soil of Mother-Earth, giving rise to ever new forms of life, one after the other. Paragraph fifteen is particularly significant because it high-lights the continuous chain which binds together the natural bodies. This all happens in dependence on God the Father-Sun, the true cause of the entire causal process:Thus the present contained the past, and what was to come lay concealed in each, for one thing involved another in a continual series; by which means this earth, from its continued beginnings (auspiciis), was perpetu-ally in a kind of birth, and, as it were, looking to that which was to follow; while it was also in the end, and, as it were, forgetful of what was gone before; and receding from the center to progression in its orbit receding it continually involved new powers from which uses were to be succes-sively unfolded.23A model of creatio continua replaces the idea of creatio ex nihilo. Nothing comes from nothing, but from something pre-existing, already containing within itself the traces of the future generation:Each offspring in this case, like the great parent herself, breathed interi-orly a kind of perpetuity, and a spring resembling the great one; but one efflorescent germination in one way, and another in another, thus in a thousand modes. It was [a property] common to all, that each produced new seeds, the hope of a future race, which having conceived from its ultimate strength, and afterwards brought forth, it let down into the great bosom of the parent, near its own, and covered with its own leaves, and when these were fallen into dust, overspread it with new ground, and thus, like a new parent, prepared it to call forth and bring forth its off-spring. It was otherwise with others of the offspring; for being quickened again and again with their stock, they either renovated their flowers in a long series, or resuscitated themselves from their own ashes; for the sap, which, being extracted from the mother, they diffused into their veins, was laden with pure principles, and thus was fruitful in innumerable new beginnings of itself; for the whole earth throughout was already a semi-nary and ovary, and ground at length grew up from the tombs of dead 23 Swedenborg, De cultu, §15."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Crasta and Follesa230<UN>flowers. There was still a difference with other efflorescences, for in every place and every time there was a constant variety.24Here we clearly see two basic elements that occur in Swedenborgian philoso-phy of nature: on the one hand, life, principle of all things and eternal force that permeates from within every creature, on the other, death, as nature is in itself. Death and dead nature, conceived by Swedenborg as exteriority, are nothing but tools for life. This latter is the force that constantly recurs in an endless variety of ways to reach the highest level, namely, the soul and the spirit.25This unbroken chain of beings justifies the generational similarities. Each new creation bears within itself traces of its predecessor, and retains the vi-tal or conative force, which – according to Swedenborg – is the source of the natural world. It is interesting to compare this perspective with Ovid’s Meta-morphoses, a work that Swedenborg owned in two different editions.26 In the xv book, starting from verse 391, Ovid wrote:Now these I named derive their origin from other living forms. There is one bird which reproduces and renews itself: the Assyrians gave this bird his name the Phoenix. [...] When this bird completes a full five centu-ries of life straightway with talons and with shining beak he builds a nest among palm branches, where they join to form the palm tree’s waving top. As soon as he has strewn in this new nest the cassia bark and ears of sweet spikenard, and some bruised cinnamon with yellow myrrh, he lies down on it and refuses life among those dreamful odors. And they say that from the body of the dying bird is reproduced a little Phoenix which is destined to live just as many years.27This Ovidian metamorphosis, namely the image of the phoenix rising from its ashes, makes us reflect on the development of various forms of animal life from inanimate forms. Swedenborg refers to a ‘seminal nature, animated from inmosts’,28 which leads from vegetable forms to animal beings. In De cultu, 24 Swedenborg, De cultu, §19.25 On the distinction between nature and life, see Swedenborg, Oeconomia, i, §§234–235, and also between body and soul, Oeconomia, ii, §§283–285.26 Swedenborg owned the following two editions of Ovid’s Metamorphoses: Ovidii Metamor-phoseon, Leipzig, 1714 and Ovidius, Operum, Fastorum Libri xii, Amsterdam, 1649.27 Ovid, Metamorphoses, v. 391 ff.28 Swedenborg, De cultu, §25."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"231The Arcanes of the World<UN>the same vegetal kingdom serves as a “seminary” and ‘hatched new-born little eggs’,29 which rises to animal being. The initial productions are animalcula of a more primitive form; later more complex species evolve, in the same order that regulated the formation of the plant.The metamorphosis of little worms and caterpillars, ‘lower form of life or living types’, which transform into nymphs, aurelias, and chrysalises, provides the model of this kind of generation. The image of the butterfly, symbol of metamorphosis, is often chosen by Swedenborg to illustrate the ordered suc-cession of natural and spiritual forms.303 Transformation and MetamorphosisEven the German physicist and alchemist Johann Joachim Becher (1635–1682), one of the fathers of chemistry and of the theory of phlogiston, describes, in Physica subterranea (1669),31 in the same manner as Swedenborg, the Earth as a young virgin, who is bearing in her womb the seeds of future children ( Section i, Chapter 2):It is undoubtable that this earth – in that far away time other and dif-ferent from our modern one and mixed together in various ways – contained within many other substances: indeed, the substances and seeds of all things and bodies were hiding in it. That is why it could be called by right and deservedly virgin earth [terra virginea] or Panspermia: from such, so to speak, a fruitful foetus, through a later production, all things might have found their own being.3229 Swedenborg, De cultu, §25.30 Swedenborg, De cultu, §25.31 Becher’s works, such as Grosse Chymische Concordantz (1726), Opuscula Chymica rariora (1719) and Mineralisches abc (1723) are present in Swedenborg’s library (see Bergquist, Swedenborg’s Secrets, 471).32 Becher, Physica subterranea, 10: ‘Hinc terram tum temporis longe aliam, et a nostra mod-erna diversam, varie commixtam, multas alias substantias in se continuisse, indubitatum est; omnium enim rerum et corporum susbstantiae et semina in ea latitabant, unde iure merito terra virginea seu Panspermia dici poterat: unde tanquam ex foecundo foetu om-nia suum esse per successivam productionem nanciscerentur’. About this concepts, see also Kircher’s Mundus subterraneus (1678), ii, 6, 647, where we find the same idea of pan-spermia or vis seminalis."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Crasta and Follesa232<UN>These themes are clearly present in a seventeenth-century cultural context, which Swedenborg seems to be aware of, especially with regard to his inter-ests in chemical, mineralogical and metallurgical works. Strongly related with alchemical tradition (from Paracelsus to J. Van Helmont, from Kircher to Becher), these disciplines form a unitary basis for knowledge of the natural world, in which the boundaries between inorganic and organic, or inanimate and animate, are very unstable. The same analogy drawn by Swedenborg be-tween the early Earth and the egg, well attested in contemporary literature, was also present in Becher. He gave, like Burnet, a very detailed description of the origins, where biological metaphors are significant:We will therefore imagine the state of our sky and globe in the first cre-ation before production to be [contained] in the earth, water and air as an ovum, the yolk being the earth, the albumen the water, the cuticle the air and the shell the sky. Certainly this place of the ovum, which embraces and contains, might need a Deity.33A few lines later, Becher focuses on the distinction between the verbs creare, fieri, and producere and establishes a difference between “to create” (creare), in the sense of “create from nothing” (creare ex nihilo), which refers to an intelli-gent cause, and “to produce” (producere) a term alluding instead to the second-ary causes.34 Although Swedenborg does not explicitly bring out such diversity of meaning, he seems to adopt the concept of continuous generation (genera-tio continua) as a middle term between the idea of a creation in the true sense and that of the producere of nature through a natural type of causality. The same use of the concept of metaphysical point, in the works of physics, and of archeus, especially in the Oeconomia, intended as middle terms between the Infinite and the natural reality, is indicative of a guiding force of the process of generatio continua which characterises the whole nature. Such a force, or 33 Becher, Physica subterranea, 12–13: ‘Statum ergo nostri coeli et globi terr-aque-aërei in prima creatione ante productionem se ut ovum habuisse, nobis imaginabimur; cujus vitellus terram, albumen aquam, cuticula aërem et putamen coelum, ambiens vero locus seu continens ovi, Deitatem indigitat [sic]’.34 Becher, Physica subterranea, 13: ‘Ante omnia vero differentia vocabulorum, creare, fieri, producere exponenda est [...]. De vocabulo creare jam in praecedentibus dictum est; fiat vero a vocabulo producat in eo differt, quod hoc ad mixtionem, illud ad motum spectabat.

In the connection of antecedents and consequents lies the possibility of understanding the passage from one species to another. These depend, in turn, on the action of plasmatic power inherent in them, since the beginning of all things; such a force ensures, in many different ways, the specificity of the new productions.4 Adam, the Only-BegottenThe egg, as we have previously pointed out, is an indeterminate principle, therefore able to develop beings that could also be extremely complex. To such an egg, Swedenborg assigns the task to generate man. Adam or the first man and the only-begotten, last step on the ladder of beings and final purpose of creation, is the intermediate link that enables the reunion of the natural world and the spiritual. Adam does not originate from the fiat of God, designed in his image and likeness, but inside of his own egg, like all other beings. His special egg, matured on the branches of a special tree, the Tree of Life, devel-ops in a region of the primordial Earth where nature reveals itself in all its perfection.The birth of the first man, described in such a singular manner by Sweden-borg, has many elements drawn from classical sources and in the first place from Ovid. The transformations of men and women into trees and flowers, especially in the tenth book of the Metamorphoses (Cyparissus, Hyacinth), re-semble very much the Swedenborgian attempt to reconnect the human (and animal) kingdom to the vegetal one. Myrrha’s transformation into a tree and the birth of her son, Adonis, have a close resemblance to what Swedenborg writes in the De cultu about the birth of Adam:All things were now prepared; the parturient branch, according to the times of gestation, inclining itself by degrees towards the ground, at length deposited its burden commodiously on the couch spread beneath. The heavenly beings (Vitae), clothed with a bright cloud, also stood by, and found that nothing had been neglected, but that all things were pre-pared obsequiously by nature in conformity to their provisions. Hence, 35 Swedenborg, Oeconomia, i, §253. Swedenborg was aware of Paracelsian sources, and espe-cially of Jean-Baptiste van Helmont, and also of the writings of the Cambridge Platonist Henry More.

Their birth, although exceptional, occurs in a com-pletely natural manner and does not imply a direct intervention of God. The presence of the divine is not direct, but mediated. Lucina witnesses the birth of Myrrha, just as the celestial intelligences watch over Adam. The divine ele-ment is still present, in both cases, symbolically represented by the heat and the heavenly light that nourish and assist the delivery.The egg, matured on the leaf of the Tree of Life, is directly fertilised by the rays of the spiritual Sun, or Supreme Mind. All the materials that nature pro-vided are concentrated in it. This punctum vivens, containing the living force and substance or soul, can trigger the formation of man, according to a purpose of which it is aware in itself. The soul radiates from the spiritual dimension into the egg, and controls both the organic and the spiritual development of man. Therefore, from the very beginning, it is able to perceive and understand the higher purposes, driven by a burning desire to rise inwardly and spiritually to join the Sun-father:The soul, burning with this desire, as a mind formed the image of the Supreme Mind, began also to build a kind of little world or microcosm after the effigy of the great world, but not out of nothing, with the eternal purpose of clothing herself with it as with a body, and that she might operate in it as a kind of Deity, administering laws at pleasure by means of the understanding, and so holding the reins of her nature according to her intuitions that she might have only to regard ends.37The human mind, for Swedenborg, is a “small Olympus”, structured according to spiral vortexes and figures. As we have seen in the cosmological part of this essay, these vortexes are recurring images through which Swedenborg explains 36 Swedenborg, De cultu, §38.37 Swedenborg, De cultu, §35."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"235The Arcanes of the World<UN>the entire sistema naturae. As the cosmic egg expands according to the com-plex geometry of spiral vortexes, in the same way, within the man-microcosm, the mind gives orders to the body from its “palace”. This is the place from which the soul, like a deity, rules “her” kingdom, namely the body, giving to it the best shape it needs to act in the world.38 Here we find again the analogy between the organisation described at the cosmological level, or macrocosm, and the anatomical and neurological structures. The theme, present in the Oeconomia and the Regnum animale, takes in De cultu a more symbolic role by the detailed connection between forms of the mind and of the cosmos. Mathematical- geometrical and empirical knowledge, and metaphysical, symbolical and archetypal ideas are now reconciled in a coherent system, in force like a poeti-cal language. Final ConsiderationsThe archetype of the egg as a primordium is so dominant that even the birth of the first man, as we noted, is due to a special kind of egg. The “Supreme Mind” directs its attention to this egg and instills the fetus with a spirit, repre-senting the connection with the Infinite. Here it is interesting to focus on the double nature (external and internal) of our world, which is animated from the inside by a spiritual light, which lights the darkness of matter, otherwise con-demned to darkness. In several passages of De cultu we find a clear expression of both the idea of the presence of the divine light within each one of us and the double nature of our existence. Two lights coexist in our mind: a spiritual light, derived from the super-celestial Sun or divine love and another natural one, generated by the natural Sun and its heat. Both lights meet in our minds, which become the center of an entire universe where they are both material and spiritual. See again, from paragraph 56:These lights meet together in our minds, and from their meeting together they become as centres of the whole universe, namely, of heaven and of the world; hence from them, as from centres, it is allowable to wander forth with new vision into all the circumferences of the universe, and to examine each paradise, as it were, with two sets of eyes.3938 On the soul as Demi-goddess of her kingdom, i.e., the body, see also Swedenborg, Oecono-mia, i, §259.39 Swedenborg, De cultu, §56."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Crasta and Follesa236<UN>The mind, vinculum and medium between celestial and earthly things, repre-sents the link that connects, in a parallelism of forms, natural light with the celestial or spiritual one that is life, intelligence and wisdom; this prompts man towards moral behavior and drives him towards divine love.

The rather prosaic title given to this manuscript by later cataloguers—A Record of Astronomical Phenomena of Various Ages (Zapis’ astronomicheskikh iavlenii raznogo vremeni)—belies the extent to which it is a chronicle devoted entirely to charting and depicting ce-lestial and meteorological events as portentous signs of God’s imminent foray into the realm of terrestrial affairs.1 The all-encompassing scope of the work is astonishing. It not only incorporates a fascinating record of comets, meteors, eclipses and out-of-the-ordinary weather witnessed above Tobol’sk itself, but also draws on older Russian chronicles in order to interpret and document the effects of such phenomena on Muscovy and its near neighbours since the reign of Ivan iv (1530–1584). Moreover, the compiler(s) of the chronicle also cites Biblical precedents, as well as Flavius Josephus and Dionysius the Areopagite, in order to frame the work as a whole firmly within the realm of Christian providentialism.The surviving manuscript, which is housed in the Tobol’sk State Historical-Architectural Museum-Reserve (tgiamz), is something of a Siberian gem that has received surprisingly little scholarly attention. In fact, only a single arti-cle has been devoted to the chronicle: a five-page piece by A.Z. Zhavoronkov, which was published in the Soviet Union in 1961.2 Zhavoronkov concludes his brief survey of the chronicle by stressing that the manuscript deserves the ‘thorough and comprehensive research of historians, literary scholars, lin-guists [and] astronomers.’3 Whilst agreeing with this sentiment, the aim of this article is more limited: to examine the text and accompanying illustrations contained within the Tobol’sk chronicle in the context of early modern Rus-sian attitudes towards celestial divination. Consequently, in terms of structure, 1 See The Tobol’sk State Historical-Architectural Museum-Reserve (Tobol’skii gosudarvstennyi istoriko-arkhitekturnyi muzei-zapovednik), N 11570.2 Zhavoronkov, ‘Letopisnaia kniga o Tobol’ske’.3 Zhavoronkov, ‘Letopisnaia kniga’, 499."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"241Signs in the Sky<UN>brief introductory sections on Christian providentialism and celestial divina-tion in European and Russian history will precede the main part of this study—an in-depth analysis of the chronicle itself. Christian Providentialism and Celestial DivinationChristian providentialism has recently been defined as a ‘comprehensive discourse, which attempts to portray all phenomena in relation to a single, omnipotent God,’ who uses ‘a “language” of signs’ in order to ‘“speak” to hu-manity through extraordinary occurrences.’4 Yet, whilst God made visible these signs to all, he supposedly concealed their true meaning within an eso-teric language of signs. In other words, the knowledge conveyed by God in ce-lestial signs could only be understood by a select few who were able to expertly decode their meaning. This restricted, esoteric philosophy embodied an aspect of Christian thought epitomized in Matthew 7:6: ‘Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye pearls before swine, lest they trample them un-der their feet, and turn again and rend you.’5In essence, the recourse to such a mediated, restricted interpretive philoso-phy stemmed from fear and the need of rulers to be perceived to be in control of events and to be acting in accord with God’s divine will. Since Antiquity, celestial phenomena, such as comets, had been viewed as portents of natural disasters, pestilence, war, civil strife and the death of rulers. In his Meteorology, Aristotle had warned that comets frequently ‘foreshadow wind and drought.’6 By the first century ad Marcus Manilius was writing that ‘never did Heav’n with these fires vainly burn,’ as comets signal “barren Soyl,” mortal epidemics and ‘wars they proclaim too [...] and open Arms from secret Treacheries.’7 As will be discussed below, Scripture too offered many examples of celestial por-tents that accorded with pagan philosophy.By the early modern period, a complex and sophisticated analytic system had been set in place in Europe in order to ensure that authorities were privy to accurate interpretations of celestial phenomena. As Sara Schechner outlines, ten key factors could be studied by experts in order to maximize the accuracy of their divinatory techniques: the comet’s colour, astrological conjunction, 4 Bennett, ‘Sign Languages’, 377.5 This and all subsequent citations from the Bible are from the King James Version.6 Aristotle, Meteorology, 344b, 19–20.7 Manilius, The Sphere of Marcus Manilius, 63–65."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Collis242<UN> zodiacal position, its mundane house, the direction of its tail, the geographical location of its nucleus, duration and its resemblance to past comets.8 Thus, this form of ‘learned’ celestial divination required expertise in natural philoso-phy, combined with recourse to examples from Scripture and early Christian history. Celestial Divination in RussiaCelestial divination occupied a problematic and contradictory position in Rus-sian elite culture up until the eighteenth century. On the one hand, the Ortho-dox Church long remained vehemently opposed to any form of stargazing. The publication of the Stoglav in 1551, in the wake of a church council, stipulated the following practices as “evil heresies:” Rafli, Shestokryl, crow-cawing, astron-omy, zodiacal signs, almanacs, stargazers, Gates of Aristotle, as well as “devilish prognostications.”9 Yet, on the other hand, Russian chronicles (often written by clerics) frequently interpreted celestial phenomena as portentous signs affect-ing grand princes and their realms.10Most notably, the famed early twelfth-century Russian Primary Chronicle (Povest’ vremennykh let) includes a lengthy description and interpretation of a series of auspicious omens that supposedly occurred in Rus’ in 1065. The chronicler initially describes the appearance of ‘an exceedingly large star with bloody rays,’ the birth of a monstrous foetus and how the sun ‘also suffered alteration’ and ‘became rather like the moon.’11 Numerous similar examples are then cited from Byzantine chronicles, including the ominous appearance of comets during the reigns of Nero, Justinian and Constantine v. The chroni-cler concludes by remarking: ‘Thus portents in the sky, or in the stars, or in the 8 Schechner Comets, Popular Culture, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology, 51.9 Kozhaichikov (ed.), Stoglav, 139.

Such signs are, on the contrary, of evil significance, presaging the appearance of war, famine, or death.’12Besides, chronicles, one can also point to the reign of Tsar Aleksei Mikhailov-ich (1629–1676), during which time the monarch sought the opinion of learned authorities regarding the appearance of comets. In December 1664, a comet was visible over Moscow, for example, and the tsar consequently ordered his physician, Andreas Engelhardt (d. 1683), to predict the likely consequences for the monarch and his realm. Engelhardt’s reply makes it clear that that at the forefront of the tsar’s mind was whether the comet presaged the spread of the plague to Muscovy, as it had already broken out in Holland.13 In a second let-ter to the tsar, Engelhardt wrote at length about the nature, significance and means of interpretation. Citing various early modern sources, including Cor-nelius Gemma and Girolamo Cardano (by way of David Origanus), Engelhardt listed a string of calamities heralded by the appearance of comets (war, plague, famine, the death of a ruler, changes in government and in church hierarchy and natural disasters).14 The physician also informed the tsar that it was pos-sible to make judgements concerning the impact of a comet based on the di-rection of its passage in the sky and in the zodiac and its colour.15What is more, on December 13, 1672, at a rare meeting of the Tsar’s Council, the tsar and his advisers discussed the military significance of a comet that had recently appeared over Kosice (in modern-day Slovakia). At hand for the meeting was an elaborate interpretation specifically drawn up for the tsar by Varlaam Iasinskii (1627–1707), the rector of the Kiev Mohyla College.16 Iasin-skii’s interpretation will be discussed in more detail below, as a very similar 12 The Russian Primary Chronicle, 145.

However, it is noteworthy here to add that Iasinskii was one of the most senior ecclesiastic figures in what is now Ukraine. Thus, Aleksei Mikhailovich took both a physician and a leading cleric to be learned authorities on divining the significance of comets. In other words, far from chastising the tsar for dabbling in an evil heresy, Iasinskii actu-ally furnished the monarch with his own interpretation.Moreover, Iasinksii’s willingness to provide an interpretation encapsulated a spirit of learning among Kievan clerics that was drawn to aspects of celestial divination (as well as astrology). Indeed, Kievan clerics continued to demon-strate an enthusiasm for celestial divination throughout the reign of Peter the Great. In 1702, for example, Stefan Iavorskii, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, delivered a sermon in which he proclaimed that Greek prognostica-tions centred on comets and eclipses and that Christ himself recognized such signs as heralds of future events.17 Furthermore, in 1708 the influential ecclesi-ast Feofan Prokopovich (1681–1736) argued in favour of comets signifying God’s will.18 The annual calendar produced by the Kiev Caves Monastery in 1717 also published the following prediction concerning a lunar eclipse due to occur in September:This eclipse signals a war and disagreements between sovereigns and ani-mosity between the East and West; some burden on the spiritual estate; a disease in fish; a multiplication in the number of water reptiles and worms; murders; pillage; the destruction of ships in war; and the threat of death to a certain great lord.19This far from cheerful prognosis met with no disapproval from the tsarist au-thorities in St. Petersburg.However, this was not the case after a hieromonk and icon painter from the Novgorod-Sverskii Monastery in the Chernigov region of Ukraine, by the name of Porfirii, reported a celestial vision he had witnessed when he saw a comet in the sky on the morning of January 27, 1720. He claimed to have seen a head very much reminiscent of Peter the Great, along with a Cyrillic letter “P” and a rope that looked suspiciously like a gallows, sabres, swords, feet, hands, stars and a cross.20 The foolhardy monk also illustrated his vision (see Fig. 11.1 below), which only compounded matters.17 Iavorskii, ‘Slova Stefana Iavorskago’, 88.18 Prokopovich, Filosofski tvory, 448–449.19 Pekarskii, Nauka i literatura, 313.20 Semevskii, Slovo i delo!, 37–43."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"245Signs in the Sky<UN>The archimandrite of the monastery soon caught wind of Porfirii’s troubling vision and had no qualms in reporting him to the Cossack Hetman. Before long Porfirii was in St. Petersburg and being interrogated by the head of the Tainaia kantseliariia (Secret Chancellery). After more than a year in prison awaiting a verdict, Porfirii was eventually exiled for life to the remote northern Solovetskii Monastery.21 Whilst Porfirii’s celestial vision bore all the hallmarks of a form of comet divination practised by his fellow monks in what is now Ukraine, his message dangerously eschewed acceptable conventions. In fact, Porfirii’s vision was perceived as treasonable and the swift actions of the authorities demonstrate a fear of its subversive potential. The Tobol’sk Chronicle and Celestial DivinationPorfirii recklessly challenged the divinely ordained aura of Peter the Great. No such subversive tendencies are found in the Tobol’sk chronicle, which per-fectly encapsulates the notion of a mediated providentialism that expresses a tsarist discourse of power. Evidence of official sanction can be found within the Tobol’sk chronicle, as in an entry dated November 15, 1695 where it is stated that Andrei Fedorovich Naryshkin (d. c. 1716), the Tobol’sk governor (voevoda), 21 Semevskii, Slovo i delo, 42–43.Figure 11.1 Depiction of Porfirii’s celestial vision. See Semevskii, Slovo i delo, 39"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Collis246<UN>ordered the commencement of the work on his arrival in the city. Notably, the chronicle records that at the time of Naryshkin’s arrival, a sign (zname-nie) appeared above Tobol’sk. No explicit explanation or interpretation of this phenomenon is forthcoming. However, the chronicle describes how another celestial phenomenon apparently appeared above Tobol’sk on May 5, 1698, which coincided with the arrival in the city of Mikhail Iakovlevich Cherkasskii (d. 1712), Naryshkin’s successor as voevoda, and his son Petr Mikhailovich (d. 1702). The surviving illustration of this znamenie (see Fig. 11.2 below) depicts a crescent moon above a centrally-located sun, which both appear in the sky as part of a pattern that includes two concentric circles, as well as three vertical columns and a single horizontal pillar. Was it mere coincidence that celestial signs appeared heralding the arrival of Naryshkin and Cherkasskii? It is sig-nificant that both events did not contain any negative imagery or descriptions, thereby suggesting that these should be viewed as favourable omens.The commencement of the Tobol’sk chronicle in 1695, at the behest of the regional voevoda, occurred at a time when Siberia was literally appearing on the map. Between 1696 and 1720, Semyon Ul’ianovich Remezov (1642– after 1720), along with his sons and nephew, produced three esteemed atlases of Siberia. As Valerie Kivelson notes, these cartographical works ‘bristle with philosophical, historical, and spiritual musing and bizarre riffs on the cosmic significance of the Russian presence in Siberia.’22 We do not know whether the illustrator of the Tobol’sk chronicle emanated from a school of artists centred around Remizov. However, the artist responsible for the visually arresting illus-trations in the chronicle undoubtedly benefitted from the burgeoning artistic milieu that arose in Petrine-era Tobol’sk. In this sense, the chronicle of celes-tial phenomena can be viewed as forming part of a wider drive to incorporate Tobol’sk (and Siberia as a whole) within the geographical and spiritual param-eters of the Orthodox Russian Empire. Visual material played an integral role in this endeavour, with the illustrations in the Tobol’sk chronicle providing a series of images that strengthened such associations by demonstrating God’s will at work.This begs the question of who was the intended audience for the chronicle, which makes much of the visual power of the images that correspond with the text? Whilst instigated and sanctioned by the governor of Tobol’sk, it is not clear whether the chronicle was an endeavour intended solely for the educa-tional and reference purposes of the city’s elite, or whether it was displayed to the wider population of the city?

During the Petrine era, the service elite began to be actively encouraged to note astronomical phenomena and to take account of how celestial events influence their own lives as well as wider political and military affairs affecting Russia. From 1708, for example, the state typography in Moscow (and from 1713 in St. Petersburg) published an Figure 11.2 Illustration of the celestial sign seen above Tobol’sk upon the arrival of Mikhail and Petr Cherkasskii. tgiamz, N 11570, 85vcourtesy of The Tobol’sk State Historical- Architectural Museum-Reserve"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Collis248<UN>annual calendar (Kalendar’ ili mesiatsoslov), which mixed astronomical data, prognostications and astrological information related to health and farming. Other officially endorsed calendars, such as the so-called Bruce Calendars and the annual calendars produced by the Kiev Caves Monastery, also promoted the profound impact that celestial events had on terrestrial life.23Yet, on the other hand, the latter scenario of power envisages the chronicle as a means of instilling a fear of God’s wrath among the populace and of pro-moting the divine basis of tsarist rule. In this regard, the dramatic power of the visual illustrations tapped into the cultural potency of images in Russia, which still remained dominated by religious iconography well into the eigh-teenth century.As mentioned, the Tobol’sk Chronicle is not simply a visual and written record of contemporary celestial phenomena above the skies of Tobol’sk be-tween 1695 and 1734. In addition, the chronicle provides Christian legitimacy by describing notable heavenly events recorded in the Bible and by Flavius Josephus in The Jewish War and by (Pseudo) Dionysius the Areopagite in his letter to Polycarp.24 Moreover, the chronicle draws Tobol’sk into the wider his-torical narrative and geographic space of the expansionist Russian empire. In this sense, it is wholly appropriate that the Russian historical narrative begins with the death of Ivan iv, in whose reign Muscovy dramatically expanded its borders. It is also interesting to note how the chronicle includes descriptions (and illustrations) of heavenly phenomena in Moscow and beyond— including references to Poland, the Hapsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire— thereby reflecting Russia’s preoccupation with its Western sphere of influence.(i) Religious SourcesThe only ancient, non-Christian source cited in the Tobol’sk Chronicle is Jose-phus’s The Jewish War that describes Rome’s campaign against Judea between ad 66 and ad 70, which led to the destruction of the Second Temple in Je-rusalem.25 The Tobol’sk Chronicle draws attention to how God—according to Josephus—gave the Jews of Jerusalem six signs intended as expressions of wrath and forewarning, which all went unheeded.26Significantly, the Tobol’sk Chronicle describes how the first divine sign con-veyed by God to the Jews took the form of a comet, which appeared above 23 See Collis, The Petrine Instauration, 74–93, 460–485.24 See Josephus, Josephus; Pseudo-Dionysius, The Complete Works, 266–269.25 See tgiamz, N 11570, 12v–18r.26 For the relevant passage in The Jewish War, describing these “portents of the end,” see Josephus, Josephus, vol. 3, Book vi, Chap. 5.3, 459–467."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"249Signs in the Sky<UN> Jerusalem “like a lance” and which heralded Titus’s capture and destruction of the city.27 Having ignored this most ominous of heavenly phenomena, Josephus narrates how God gave the Jews a further five signs of their imminent abject plight. Thus, next the chronicle relates Josephus’s account of how the eastern inner gate of Jerusalem appeared to move by itself during the night.28 This miraculous earthly sign was then followed by a further celestial phenom-enon and vision. Namely, how ‘before sunset there appeared in the air and in the sky [and] over the whole Judaean land chariots and regiments with weap-onry, bounding through the clouds and surrounding the cities’.29 As with each divine sign, the Tobol’sk Chronicle not only cites Josephus, but also provides a vivid illustration of the celestial vision (see Fig. 11.3 below).Interestingly, the illustration in the Tobol’sk Chronicle depicts a cityscape seemingly more reminiscent of the Siberian town in the early eighteenth cen-tury, rather than a first-century view of Jerusalem. Rather than merely repre-senting a naïve ignorance of the world beyond Tobol’sk, it could also be that the illustrator deliberately sought to emphasize that the same woeful plight potentially awaited the Siberian city if the population went against the will of God (and possibly the state).The fourth sign returns to Earth again, as it manifested itself in a man— Jesus, son of Ananias—who cried out ‘every day and night, walking round the “walls”’ about ‘a voice against Jerusalem and against the temple’.30 The Tobol’sk Chronicle then cites Josephus’s account of how a cow brought for slaughter into the temple gave birth to a lamb on the Feast of the Unleavened Bread.31 The sixth divine sign, as reckoned by the chronicle, also related to the same feast day, when Josephus describes how ‘at the 9th hour of night such a light shone on the altar on the temple’.3227 tgiamz, N 11570, 12v–13r.

Hence, reference is made to Joshua 10:13, in which it states: ‘And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged them-selves upon their enemies [...] So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day’.33 In this instance, ‘the Lord fought for Israel’.The chronicle then proceeds to give more positive celestial signs trans-mitted by God to select Old Testament prophets and rulers. A particularly in-depth section, for example, cites 2 Kings 9–11, in which Isaiah explains to Hezekiah how he will recognize the sign that heralds his ascent into the house of the Lord: ‘And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the Lord [...]: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees’.34 The chron-icle goes on to cite Exodus 10:21–22, in which God is said to have spoken to Moses and instructed him to ‘stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt’. The corresponding illustration (see Fig. 11.4 below) strikingly captures this moment, although the city shrouded in darkness amidst a desert landscape again bears all the hallmarks of a Russian kremlin, rather than an ancient Egyptian settlement.These Old Testament examples precede two accounts of the eclipse that is said to have occurred during the Passion of Christ. First, the chronicle seem-ingly draws upon Matthew 27:45, in which the gospel writer states: ‘Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour’.35 Secondly, the chronicle cites Dionysius the Areopagite’s letter to Polycarp, in which the former asks: ‘What have you to say about the solar eclipse which oc-curred when the Saviour was put on the cross?’36The pronounced emphasis in the Tobol’sk Chronicle on sources drawn from the Bible and the early Christian era served at least a two-fold purpose. First, to legitimize the chronicle’s preoccupation with celestial signs by framing it firmly within Christian discourse. By doing this, the author(s) of the chronicle could refute any opposition to the work from conservative elements within the Orthodox Church, who still zealously held to the hard-line against any form of stargazing expressed in the mid-sixteenth-century Stoglav. Second-ly, the chronicle illustrates how divine celestial signs expressed both God’s wrath and munificence.

Rather, the chronicle limits itself to the relatively recent past (from the late sixteenth century), when significant events—the death of a tsar or military conflagrations—were seemingly presaged by the appearance of heavenly signs. In other words, the chronicle provides a histori-cal narrative of decisive moments affecting Muscovy or its rivals based on the power of celestial signs as harbingers of God’s will and imminent intercession in earthly affairs.The earliest reference to Russian history in the Tobol’sk Chronicle concerns the death of Ivan iv in March 1584, which led soon after to the end of the Riurikid Dynasty and ushered in the chaotic Time of Troubles. Drawing heav-ily on the account in the Novyi letopisets of 1630, the Tobol’sk Chronicle de-scribes how two simultaneous heavenly signs appeared above Moscow prior to this event, which portended this pivotal moment in early modern Russian history:37 ‘In Moscow in the year 1584, a cross in the sun and a star with a tail appeared between the Annunciation [Cathedral] and the [Bell Tower] of Ivan the Great’. The chronicle then notes that on being shown the celestial phenom-ena, Ivan iv prophesized that it was a sign of his imminent death, which did indeed soon transpire.38The power of the accompanying illustration (see Fig. 11.5 below) is enhanced by a largely accurate depiction of the Moscow Kremlin, with both the cathe-dral (to the left) and bell tower (to the right) clearly visible in the foreground. In this instance, the value of the Tobol’sk Chronicle lies not in the originality of its account, but in the visual dimension accompanying the description. For us, the discernibility of Moscow in the image does not add authenticity to the chronicle’s account. However, it is possible that early eighteenth-century view-ers of the illustration may have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the image.The only other description of the death of a Russian monarch in the chroni-cle can be found in the penultimate entry, and relates to the passing of Peter ii in January 1730. The brief entry, which is not accompanied by an illustration, simply records that the sky to the north, west and east became emblazoned 37 For the relevant passage in the Kniga glagolemaia Novyi letopisets, to give the work its full name, see Polnoe sobranie russkikh letopisei, vol. 14, Part 1, 34.38 tgiamz, N 11570, 76r."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Collis254<UN>with various colours (crimson, red, black and white, which could possibly be a reference to the Aurora borealis).39Besides treating of the death of Russians sovereigns, the Tobol’sk Chroni-cle also documents notable celestial phenomena that appeared in the skies 39 tgiamz, N 11570, 110r.Figure 11.5 Illustration of the celestial portents that appeared above the Moscow Kremlin prior to the death of Ivan iv in 1584. tgiamz, N 11570, 75vcourtesy of The Tobol’sk State Historical- Architectural Museum-Reserve"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"255Signs in the Sky<UN>prior to significant military encounters. A lengthy interpretation is made, for example, concerning a comet that appeared over Moscow in the autumn of 1618. Once again citing from the Novyi letopisets almost verbatim, the Tobol’sk Chronicle provides a fascinating reading of this celestial phenomenon.40 At the time the forces of Wladyslaw iv Vasa (1595–1648), led by Jan Karol Chod-kiewicz (c. 1560–1621), were laying siege to Moscow, in what was the culmina-tion of the long Polish-Muscovite War.41 According to the chronicle, ‘a great and terrible sign appeared above Moscow’ during this blockade, or, in other words, a large and exceedingly bright comet.42 The head of the comet hung over Moscow itself (see Fig. 11.6 below), whilst the tail, which gradually in-creased in size, apparently faced the direction of Polish and German lands. The chronicle describes how Tsar Mikhail Romanov and his people reacted with horror at the sight of the comet, whereas the Polish forces hoped that it signalled the imminent sacking of Moscow.43However, it is noteworthy that the chronicle states that “wise philosophers” were consulted on the matter, and concluded that the appearance of the comet did not portend the desolation of the Muscovite capital. On the contrary, they interpreted the comet as a harbinger of joy and tranquility for Muscovy. This learned prognosis was based on the theory that only malignant forces that em-bodied God’s ill will would assail realms situated beneath the tail of a comet. This optimistic prediction conveniently overlooked the belief that the nucleus of a comet overhead portended malevolent influences below.44 The chronicle then endorses the wisdom of this prognosis by highlighting the desolation and carnage that befell Livonian and German lands between 1619 and 1630 during the Thirty Years’ War.45Arguably the most remarkable illustration in the entire Tobol’sk Chronicle depicts the signs seen in the sky in the wake of a comet seen above Kosice in November 1672. This illustration (Fig. 11.7), along with the textual description, bears a striking resemblance to the interpretation of the celestial event made by Varlaam Iasinskii on the order of Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich.46 Hence it is possible to largely decode the meaning of the vision as perceived by Iasinskii and reimagined in the Tobol’sk Chronicle.40 tgiamz, N 11570, 76v–78r.

In short, descrip-tions of celestial phenomena in the Bible or that occurred prior to seismic moments in Muscovite history are accorded elaborate descriptions and lavish illustrations. However, the observations of celestial phenomena above Tobol’sk reveal a mindset in which God’s will was seen to be acting on a less grand scale. Consequently, one can note many entries without any degree of interpretation, which are also accompanied by simple sketches. On the whole, the appearance of celestial signs above Tobol’sk were related to purely local concerns, which either corresponded to the natural environment or compara-tively minor events affecting the inhabitants of the Tobol’sk area.The chronicle documents all such celestial phenomena dating back to 1652. A typical entry notes how a solar eclipse occurred on November 12, 1675, which led to birds freezing.49 Moreover, on July 8, 1706 another solar eclipse occurred during which time a man was apparently visible in the sun (see Fig. 11.8 below). Apart from stipulating how long this sign was visible for above Tobol’sk, the chronicle simply notes that ‘in the Tobol’sk area (uezd) appeared monstrous cattle and unhealthy water.’50The chronicle also notes that a comet appeared above the banks of the River Irtysh, near Tobol’sk, after thieves had set alight a granary used by the state for 48 The chronicle describes other heavenly signs outside Muscovy territory, such as a comet and eclipse that affected the Polish kings Jan Olbracht (1459–1501) and Sigismund iii Vasa (1566–1632) respectively. One also finds reference to a comet seen above Damascus in November 1652, which was shortly followed by the sighting of a fiery dragon in a Greek Orthodox realm (referred to as Askaia) located between Serbia and Constantinople. See tgiamz, N 11570, 2v–3r, 3v–4r, 46r and 26v–27r respectively. The description of the dragon is borrowed from the Novgorodskii khronograf of the seventeenth century.

Instead of a description and interpretation of a celestial sign, one reads an account of how a demon was observed dancing and speaking as he made his way down a city street.52 It is impossible to glean why the chronicle author(s) abandoned looking up at the sky, concentrating rather on earthly apparitions cavorting on the streets of Tobol’sk.Yet, leaving this final description aside, the Tobol’sk manuscript provides what to my knowledge is the sole Russian chronicle devoted almost entirely to recording and interpreting celestial signs. This alone makes the document significant, as it offers a unique perspective on pivotal events in early modern Russian history. The chronicle also reveals fascinating insights into the micro-history of Tobol’sk, via the prism of celestial phenomena.As mentioned, the chronicle coincided with the cartographical works of Sergei Remizov, whose atlases did much to foster a sense of Siberia as an inte-gral part of the Russian (and Orthodox) empire. To a lesser extent, admittedly, the Tobol’sk Chronicle also demonstrates a similar dynamic, whereby Siberia is inextricably linked to pivotal moments in the Christian narrative and Russian history. Moreover, as part of official culture of the era, the Tobol’sk Chronicle offers evidence of how celestial divination was still being endorsed and uti-lized as a means of promoting and linking the interests of the Russian state with the notion of Christian providentialism.What is more, the illustrations that richly adorn the Tobol’sk Chronicle are not merely decorative features. Indeed, in their sheer scope, they constitute an unparalleled source vis-à-vis early modern Russia, which allows historians to observe how early eighteenth-century Siberian chroniclers imagined, or rein-terpreted, Biblical, historical and contemporary descriptions of celestial signs. We do not know why the Tobol’sk Chronicle concluded in 1734. However, it may well be that hostile attitudes to such semi-official expressions of celestial divination played a part in its demise. Only five entries are recorded between 51 For more on apocalyptic sentiment in Russia at this time, see Collis, The Petrine Instaura-tion, 219–269.52 tgiamz, N 11570, 111r."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Collis262<UN>1721 and 1734, compared to forty between 1695 and 1720. This suggests enthu-siasm for the chronicle had already started to wane by the early 1720s. Thus, whilst the Tobol’sk Chronicle may well have initially reflected the general inter-est in celestial phenomena among the elite in Petrine Russia, its decline could well have been as a result of the rapid advancements in astronomical science in the country in the first quarter of the eighteenth century.BibliographyAristotle, The Works of Aristotle, edited by W.D.

Szönyi The Books of EnochIt may sound surprising, but in our postmodern age one of the most popular biblical characters is Enoch, the Patriarch, seventh from Adam, who was righ-teous, was permitted to walk with God, and still in his life was translated into an immortal being – according to some versions of the legend into none other than the great angel, Metatron, regent of the Lord.A simple search on Google with the terms “Book of Enoch” or “Metatron,” offers tens of thousands of hits, with references ranging from scholarly debates and publications to such surprising New Age phenomena as Enochian magic or a hip-hop slogan: ‘Enoch the Ethiopian: Greater than Abraham, holier than Moses.’1 The career of Enoch from Old Testament times to the present forms an amazing cultural history with connections to religious studies, esotericism, art- and literary history, even questions of atheism, race, and gender. In the first part of my paper I briefly outline the textual history of the Enochian lore; in the second I shall introduce some interesting specimens of this lore from the Eng-lish Victorian period together with their wider historical contexts. In the mean-time I hope to demonstrate in what different capacities the character of Enoch and his myth have inspired mystical and esoteric ideas over the centuries.The Old Testament treats Enoch very sparingly (Fig. 12.1).From Genesis 5:18–22 we learn that Enoch lived 365 years; at the age of 65 he begat Methuselah, then ‘walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.’ Enoch’s great grandson was Noah, who by God’s grace transferred earthly life, including humanity to the postdiluvian world. From the New Testament letter of St. Jude we also learn about Enoch’s important prophecies and St. Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews also mentioned Enoch as somebody who was righteous and had unshaken faith (11:5).21 Advertisement for Indus Khamit Kush, Enoch, the Ethiopian, The Lost Prophet of the Bible, 2000.

Its most intriguing episode is mentioned in Genesis 6, according to which the Sons of God saw the Daughters of Men, they took them as wives and from their wedlock giants were born who were wicked and their evil nature made God regret creating the human race. As a consequence, the Lord decided to destroy humanity and in the end only Noah and his family were spared. Genesis 6 is not very clear, it has contradictions and ambiguities that have been generating fierce debates from the time of the Church Fathers to today.3 It is not clear, unavoidable to briefly summarize the textual lore relating to Enoch. Because of this, I could not help reiterating this information on repeated occasions. See my ‘The Reincarnations of Enoch from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance’ and ‘Promiscuous Angels...’.3 These debates are best summarized in VanderKam’s Enoch and the Growth of an Apocalyptic Tradition and also his Enoch, A Man for All Generations.

An apocryphal text, the Book of Enoch throws much clearer light on these events. According to its first 32 chapters, the ‘Book of the Watchers,’ two hun-dred rebel angels, under the leadership of Shemihazah and Asael, descended to the earth, fell in love with the Daughters of Men, sired children who became terrible, destructive giants; in the meantime they also taught the humans all sorts of dangerous sciences: magic, metallurgy, warfare, even female cosmet-ics.

He did so, but the Lord rejected the appeal. Nevertheless, this is how Enoch was transported to heaven and got warning about the coming Deluge which he then passed on to his offsprings, Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah.The origins of the Enoch-mythology go back to Sumerian times and show some kinship with the story of Gilgamesh.5 On this basis the story of the Watchers and most other parts of the book were written in Hebrew or Aramaic in the time of the Second Temple. Large fragments of this text survived among the Dead Sea Scrolls causing great scholarly sensation in the middle of the twentieth century.6Some time in the first or second century ce, the Book of Enoch was translat-ed into Greek (we have the whole story of the Watchers)7 and from this yet an-other translation was made into Ge’ez, the language of the Christian Church of Ethiopia where the book became canonized among the books of the Old Testa-ment. This is what today is known as 1 Enoch.8 About the same time the Greek text was further developed and translated into Old Church Slavonic where it survived among the sacred texts of the Orthodox Christian Church, becoming known as 2 Enoch.9 Furthermore, sometime between the fourth and the sixth centuries, influenced by early Jewish Merkabah mysticism, another Hebrew book was created, in which, as summarized by Gershom Scholem, the visions of Enoch become accounts given to Rabbi Ishmael who in a trance visits the heavenly palaces. ‘The Patriarch [Enoch] relates his own metamorphosis into the angel Metatron, when his flesh was transformed into “fiery torches”.’10 translation (without annotations): 1 Enoch: A New Translation, tr. & ed.

This particular book later became baptized by its mod-ern editor as 3 Enoch.11It is noteworthy, that none of these three texts was widely known during the centuries of the European Middle Ages and the early modern period. After long debates among the Church Fathers 1 Enoch was suppressed and decanonized and finally became forgotten for a very long time.12 2 Enoch was used only in the Orthodox Slavic community and 3 Enoch was only known to Hebrew mys-tics.

According to his theory, there were three Hermeses. One had lived before the Flood and he had been Enoch; the second lived among the Chaldeans and he founded Babylon after the Flood. The third also lived after the Flood and was a famous physician and scientist among the Egyptians, also known as Hermes Trismegistus.14 The three figures were soon conflated in the European imagination and in the later Middle Ages a mythical Enoch cum or alias Hermes Trismegistus was considered as a great magus, founder of math-ematics, astrology and alchemy.15The Renaissance can be characterized by a fervent search for the magical-mystical writings of Enoch: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) – one of the first gentiles to have access to Hebrew kabbalistic mysteries – was fascinated by the angel Metatron;16 scholars from Guillaume Postel (1510–1581) to Athanasius Kircher (1601–1680) were searching for the Enochian language which they identified with the language of angels also used by Adam in Para-dise; John Dee (1527–1608) even developed a system of angel magic to acquire this powerful tool directly from the supernatural beings.17But all this remained speculation until in the second half of the eighteenth century, James Bruce (1730–1794), while exploring Ethiopia, found several cop-ies of the Book of Enoch (1 Enoch) and brought them back to Europe. He gave a detailed description of it in his Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile in 1768–73 in Five Volumes (1790).18 The Aberdeen Magazine, after the publication of the five-volume travelogue, published a digest of the reports, referring to the discovery as follows:14 See Plessner, ‘Hermes Trismegistus and Arab Science’; recently van Bladel, The Arabic Hermes.15 Thorndike, History of Magic, 2:222ff; especially 222, n. 5; see also my ‘The Reincarnations of Enoch’.16 See Copenhaver, ‘Number, Shape, and Meaning in Pico’s Christian Cabala...’; Farmer, Syn-cretism in the West; Wirszubski, Pico della Mirandola’s Encounter with Jewish Mysticism.17 On Postel’s language theory: Eco, Search for the Perfect Language, 188–90; Secret, Hermé-tisme et Kabbale, ‘Le Raziel et le Livre d’Enoch chez Postel...’, 119–36.

The more ancient history of that book is well known. The church at first looked upon it as apocryphal; and as it was quoted in the book of Jude, the same suspicion fell upon that book, also. For this reason, the council of Nice threw the epistle of Jude out of the canon, but the council of Trent, argu-ing better, replaced the apostle in the canon as before.19The copy in the Bodleian Library became the object of research for Richard Laurence (1760–1838), Hebraist and orientalist of Christ Church, Oxford (and later archbishop of Cashel), who prepared an English translation and a criti-cal edition of the text.20 The first edition of the original Ge’ez text was done by the German orientalist August Dillman (1823–1894) in 1851 and, as of the early twentieth century, newer and newer scholarly editions quite regularly came out in harmony with the new results produced by extensive philological research.21 To complicate things, 2 Enoch was discovered in the late nineteenth century, while 3 Enoch became known to scholars only in the early twentieth.22 The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and among them the original text of 1 Enoch revolutionized Enoch-research and now one can speak of a flourish-ing Enoch-industry, including the study of the relationship between the three Enoch-books.19 The Aberdeen Magazine, Literary Chronicle, and Review for the Year mdccxc, 483–484.20 The Book of Enoch, the Prophet: An Apocryphal Production, supposed for ages lost; but dis-covered at the close of the last century in Abyssinia; now first translated from an Ethiopic ms of the Bodleian Library (1821).21 See Dillman’s Ge’ez and German editions in the bibliography. The wider contexts of Enoch-literature were established by Robert Henry Charles, whose four editions were published between 1893 and 1917. It was he, who claimed: ‘To the biblical scholar and to the student of Jewish and Christian theology 1 Enoch is the most important Jewish work written between 200 bc and 100 ad’ (quoted by Boccacini, Enoch and Qumran Origins, 2).22 2 Enoch was first published in Russian in the 1860s, then German, English, and Latin trans-lations followed in the 1890s.

To the best of my knowledge the first such sermon, entitled Enoch’s Walk and Change, was com-posed in 1655 by Thomas Jacombe (1622–1687), Minister of Martinus-Ludgate in London, over the Reverend Richard Vines and by 1657 it had three editions.Among many other examples an interesting specimen is an anonymous poem over the dead body of Alexander, the Lord Bishop of Edinburgh, because it adopted the form of a dialogue between Enoch and Elias ([Edinburgh] 1720) in which Enoch’s translation – referring to the deceased bishop – is described with the following elevated words:as the blest, incessant ExerciseOf raptur’d Angels in Devotion lies;So by it’s Aid, he, more than human grown,Had in th’ Angelick Nature lost his own.25Perhaps the most famous divine receiving an Enoch-sermon was the Harvard graduate Puritan scholar and defender of the Salem witch trials, Cotton Mather (1663–1728). The publication reads: The Holy Walk and Glorious Translation of Blessed Enoch. A Sermon preached at the Lecture in Boston, two days after the death of the Reverend and learned Cotton Mother who departed his life Febr. 13, 23 Strictly speaking the Victorian period lasted from 1837 to 1901, I use “the long Victorian period” in a similar sense to concepts such as “the long 19th century”.24 E.g.

The following quotation demonstrates the typical diction of these funeral sermons:SINGULAR in the Old World was the Person and the Thing here spoken of; the holy Life and the happy End of blessed Enoch. He was the most remarkable and distinguished among the Patriarchs before the Flood; for his eminent Godliness & excelling Piety; for his short and fervent Life, and God’s taking him to Heaven without seeing Death. He was a Man of God, a zealous Prophet of the Lord, and preach’d earnestly to the Sinners in his day of the Coming of Christ to Judgement. And God rewarded his excelling faith, sanctity &. labours, with a distinguishing exit.26In the first part of the sermon the author elaborates on three topics: that Enoch walked with God, that he was not, and that God took him. In the second part comes the application, first in general terms, finally in relation to Cotton Mother:O how would the late Servant of Christ and of Souls (who now lies by the Wall (as we speak) and his Mouth is stopt by Death from speaking) how would he it be now stood in my place, have play’d the Artillery of Heaven, upon careless and insensible Sinners; and set all the Terrors of God in ar-ray before them; and told them how far they are from the blessedness of Enoch in his end, being strangers to his walk with God? Ibid., 17The Victorian period also abounded in such sermons and moralizing treatises meditating upon the righteousness of the blessed Enoch and associating his exaltation with the passing away of certain reverends.27 The publication of the apocryphal text, however, kindled much less orthodox inspirations, too.

It did not take long for the Romantic poets and artists to become interested in this curious love affair. In 1823, just before his death, Lord Byron (1788–1824) published a drama, Heaven and Earth, a Mystery, dealing with the romance be-tween the Sons of God and the earthly women. In the same year, his friend, the Irish poet Thomas Moore (1779–1852), brought out his romantic epyllions, The Loves of Angels, equipped with meticulous notes, referring to the Book of Enoch and other apocryphal and classical texts.29 In his paratext he claimed that his poetry had been inspired by the Book of Enoch and some Platonist fantasies but this should not be mistaken for the only authority, the Scriptures. The apocry-phal Enoch is stimulating for the artistic imagination, but otherwise is nothing but ‘rhapsodical fiction’:The foundation of my story, therefore, has as little to do with Holy Writ as have the dreams of the later Platonists, or the reveries of the Jew-ish divines; and, in appropriating the notion thus to the uses of poetry, I have done no more than establish it in that region of fiction, to which the opinions of the most rational Fathers, and of all other Christian theo-logians, have long ago consigned it.30Critics, although appreciative of Moore’s fine poetry, entirely disapproved of the profanization of the Biblical topic.31 The result was, that in the end Moore rewrote his poems, transposing the Enochian-Biblical setting into an Oriental-Muslim one, carefully changing ev-ery “Lord” to “Allah”, “hell” to “Gehim”, “Lucifer” to “Eblis,” and so on.28 However, it is worth mentioning some popularizing magazine-reviews of Laurence’s publication and the ensuing debates: Anon., ‘The Book of Enoch,’ Fraser’s Magazine for Town and Country, 8:47 (November 1833), 51–130; B.E.

For example Robert Stafford’s epic poem, Enoch (1860) remained entirely on orthodox ground as did James M’Henry’s narrative poem, The Antediluvians, or the World Destroyed (1839).35 Truth be told, these epic poems are hardly exciting reading. About the latter The Eclectic Review wrote as follows:A decided current of poetry has of late years set in towards Noah’s flood, and if the geologists have yet failed to dig up any of the fossil remains of the Antediluvians, the poets have, however, been more successful, and bid fair to raise up again before our astonished eyes, nations of the drowned as numerous as the living to-day. Dr. M’Henry, who has just giv-en us ten books on this subject, has apparently been so deep in the flood, that he actually is not aware that anybody has been there but himself...According to the same review, Dr. M’Henry’s muse was straying carelessly when he introduced an imaginary patriarch, Jethuran, who ascended to heav-en in the manner of Enoch. According to the critic, being inconsistent with the Scriptures was considered to be a serious blunder as late as the nineteenth century.To drift away from art and literature we might want to note the emergence of new Victorian Enochs, prophets, who claim to be righteous, chide the world, threaten with a new destruction or promise rescue, as it was granted to Noah before the Flood.In 1839 a Scottish pastor, William Aldis published in Edinburgh a curious book that survives only in two known copies: The Holy Prophecies, Visions and Life of the Prophet Enoch. Introduced by an Epistle on Church Union, for the Jews’ Conversion, and Restoration of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The title page also mentions that this was ‘preached to vast multitudes in England and Scotland.’36 This work gave an account of the discovery of the Ethiopian Enoch-book, and republished Laurence’s translation in a significantly altered way: the text re-mained the same but the order was changed and was completed by some un-known passages. The last part of the book invited the reader into Aldis’s own world of prophecies, inspired obviously by the example of the righteous Enoch.35 See M’Henry and Stafford in the Bibliography.36 To my knowledge, the work exists only in two copies, one in the Robertson Special Col-lections of the Glasgow University Library, where I found it. I have not been able to find biographical information about William Aldis."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Szönyi282<UN>Aldis’s revelations are definitely overshadowed by an even more unusual book published in 1872 under the title Enoch, the Second Messenger of God. Containing the Apocryphal Book of Enoch by a mysterious author who called himself “a dot in a circle,” reminding one of the alchemical sign of sun/gold. The author was Edward Vaughan Hyde Kenealy (1819–1880), one of the real eccentric characers of the Romantic era. Trained as a barrister, but because of various scandals turned into prophetic writer, the Oxford Dictionary of Na-tional Biography summarizes his works as follows: ‘He carried the extravagance and unconventionality which had wrecked his legal career into his spiritual life, fabricating from ancient texts an extraordinary mystic religion of his own: he believed he was the twelfth Messenger of God, part of a line that included Adam, [Enoch], Jesus Christ, and Ghengis Khan.’37 Kenealy’s second messen-ger was Enoch, but his publication does not even remotely follow the origi-nal document. It is a dense, intertextual “general mythology,” fusing a purified Christology with all sorts of Eastern influences – becoming a distant relative of the contemporary Madame Blavatsky’s theosophy.Kenealy’s syncretic and often paradoxical world picture was extremely com-plicated. While he intensely disliked the followers of institutionalized Chris-tian churches (whom he called “Petro-Paulists”) and one of his most favoured oracular authorities was Zarathustra, he also had radical social views, and, alas, despised the Jews for crucifying Jesus (at the same time claiming that he had many highly honoured Jewish friends). At the beginning of the book he writes a response to the letter of a reader who had commented on his previous vol-ume. Here he praises esotericism as follows:What would the world be without the Supernatural? What the East with-out its divine Buddhas; its Zaradusht bright as the Morning Star, and the heaven-dreamer of Arabia? what the West had not Jesus come from on high to rescue it from rabbinism and the gods? What would Europe have been in the long night of the middle ages if certain holy men and holy women had not had divine Visions of the Celestial?38Historians say he was the most dynamic political demagogue between the Chartist movement and the rise of socialism, and his program even included 37 Hamilton, ‘Kenealy, Edward Vaughan Hyde (1819–1880),’ rev.

And I find with sorrow that petro-paulites are, as a rule, worse than the follow-ers of Buddha, Brahm, or Mohamed; while they hypocritically pretend that they are the best and purest of mankind... Ibid., xviiiThe last quotation, of course, is more modern than anything coming from the Books of Enoch, however Kenealy’s general message, namely that his “mission is to promulgate Truth,” draws strong inspiration from the apocalypticism of the Book of Enoch. So in the writings of Aldis and Kenealy we see the reincarna-tion of Enoch the Prophet who witnessed the terrible judgement of God and had forewarned humans about its coming.***My favorite tribute to Enoch from the above defined “long” Victorian period is a novel by LeRoy Hooker (1840–1906), titled Enoch the Philistine: A Traditional Romance of Philistia, Egypt and the Great Pyramid, published in 1898 (Fig. 12.6).The main character of the novel is Enoch, actually not the Patriarch, but the son of an Izraelite tribal leader whose father, upon his deathbed, gives him the Roll of Enoch, written by the Biblical Enoch, their forefather. Old Enoch appears to him in his sleep and brings him into the state of ascension on high.39 See McWilliam, ‘The Tichborne claimant and the people’, DPhil diss., U.

In that moment I was filled with delight surpassing the chiefest pleasure it is given man to know. An instant my spirit lin-gered, hovering over the bed, and looked down in wonder upon my body that was prone thereon, as if in sleep.40Thus the ancient lifts young Enoch’s soul out of his body, elevates it, and after a dazzlingly shining vision gives him a task.41 He is supposed to go to Egypt, and convert there the Pharaoh (King Suphis, i.e., Cheops from the Fourth Dynasty) to the monotheistic religion of the Israelites, then build an astrologically de-termined huge monument of a pyramid in order to demonstrate the greatness of the single god.He pointed afar to the south. And I looked, and, behold, a naked rock; and the rock grew into a great hill, and went on to grow until it became a mountain. And the mountain was four square at the foot, and the sides of it were smooth as if they were made of hammered stone, and they inclined, and they came together, in a sharp point, at the top. And yet he that was with me spake no word; but while I looked, and marveled to see the rock grow into a mountain, he pointed up into heaven, and, lo, a shaft of light, reaching far above all height that the eye of man could see, descended and rested on the top of the mountain. Ibid., 47Hindered by various adventures and perils, young Enoch nevertheless fulfills the mission and builds the pyramid according to the instructions of the Roll of Enoch. At the end of the story he returns to his land in Philistia, unites his neighbors into a confederation under his own kingship and brings happiness to his people. Upon this occasion he once again experiences the ascension on high, when old Enoch lifts his soul out of his body and assures him about the success of his future plans.Not much known of the writer, although the Enoch-novel is registered by The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction where Hooker is described as ‘1840–1906, Canadian minister and writer, perhaps best known for a long poem in praise of the United Empire Loyalists (British subjects who emigrated northwards dur-ing and after the American Revolutionary War); of SF interest is Enoch The 40 Hooker, Enoch the Philistine, 46.41 On the various traditions and techniques of ascension, see Idel, Ascension on High."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Szönyi286<UN>Philistine, a Lost Race tale told in the first person by a man who experiences romance and desperation in the Middle East.’42He was undoubtedly aware of the nineteenth-century debates concerning Enoch, ranging from philological exegesis to the wildest speculations, accord-ing to which the forefather carved all his magical knowledge on two pillars, Jachin and Boaz (creative Sun and reflective Moon), before the Flood, later this knowledge was shared with certain selected individuals. This is represented in the novel by the Roll of Enoch, container of ancient and sacred wisdom.43The late nineteenth and early twentieth century was also the time when – in the course of the development of Egyptology as a young science – Egyptian monotheism was identified and much speculation was devoted to the possible inspiration resulting in this radical turn in the traditional Egyptian religion. Fa-mous Egyptologists from 1869 onward – Emmanuel de Rougé, Eugene Grébaut, Karl Lepsius, and others – expressed ideas that the Egyptian religion, at least implicitly, could be related to monotheism.44It is difficult not to associate Hooker’s novel with the above-mentioned developments in Egyptology, and at the same time with other contemporary fiction capitalizing on the attractive image of Egypt, such as Pharaoh by Nobel-prize winner Boleslaw Prus (1897), or sometime later Mika Waltari’s Sinuhe, the Egyptian (1945).45 The latter was based on a famous literary narrative, The Story of Sinuhe, dating from the period of the Twelfth Dynasty (about 1962 bc), which Waltari transposed to the time of the Amarna ruler, Ehnaton/Akhenat-en of the Eighteenth Dynasty (cc. 1364–47 bc), introducer of a monotheistic Sun-cult in Egypt.Around the same time that Hooker was writing his novel, the father of psy-choanalysis Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) famously speculated about the possi-bility that Moses got the idea of establishing monotheism among the Hebrews from Ehnaton’s reforms.46 Of course, the other direction has also been suggest-ed, namely, that the Amarna ruler developed his ideas through the influence of a Jew, possibly Moses. Today, historians reject both alternatives, but in the late nineteenth century LeRoy Hooker could easily be attracted to such ideas.42 See www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hooker_le_roy#sthash.1SnReEPG.dpuf, access: 2015-01-10.

The lat-ter, according to Jewish mystical tradition (e.g., the Sefer Yetzirah),47 learnt magic in Egypt. Actually in the novel it is Abraham, invited by the young Enoch to the court of Suphis, who finally convinces the pharaoh to adopt the religion of the one true God.Again, O king, I ask thee.

His description of the experience of ascension on high closely corresponds how Moshe Idel has characterized this state and mental-magical exercise:[Apocalyptic literature] propelled a series of figures into celestial zones – ‘out of this world,’ to use Culianu’s phrase – in order to allow them to return with the credential of having had an interview with the divine monarch. Journeys and books about such journeys have been attributed to Moses, Abraham, Isaiah, and Enoch. In some cases, deep transforma-tions of human personality, including some corporeal changes, are evi-denced as a result of their visits to the supernatural worlds.48In fact, the interview during the ascension on high could take place not nec-essarily with the divine monarch directly, high-ranking angels also played an intermediary role.

Therefore it is that I cannot speak often with thee as a man speaketh with his friends; for thy flesh is yet unchanged; and it would not be for thy good that I should many times call thy spirit out of thy body as I have done this night [...] Then we descended toward the earth, and passed through the covering of my pavilion to the bed whereon my body was lying. And Enoch touched my body, and passed his hands over it as he did at the first, and my spirit returned into my body; but Enoch vanished out of my sight.49Enoch the Philistine is not a literary masterpiece, but a characteristic example of how inspiring the recently discovered and popularized Book of Enoch be-came for the romantic and post-romantic imagination. Hooker’s novel is also noteworthy for its effort to reflect on contemporary scholarly achievements in two distinct but nevertheless related fields of cultural historical studies, Egyp-tology and Jewish studies. In his preface, the novelist himself acknowledged his twofold debt as follows: ‘With boundless gratitude I acknowledge my in-debtedness to many learned writers on Egypt and the Pyramid, and to the ven-erable Hebrew Talmudists’ (Hooker, Enoch the Philistine, iv). Towards a (Post)modern Career of the PatriarchAs I am coming to my conclusion I would like to highlight one more trend of interest in Enoch which completes the spectrum of cultural representa-tions focusing on the ancient patriarch. One of the most important devel-opments in modern occultism was the rise of Theosophy in the second half of the nineteenth century. Like many of her predecessors in search of tran-scendental wisdom, the movement’s central figure, Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831–1891) tried to create a syncretic system bridging Western and Eastern metaphysics, intuition, religion, magic and science. Her major works, 49 Hooker, Enoch the Philistine, 48."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"289Victorian Enoch and Historical Contexts<UN>Isis Unveiled (1877) and The Secret Doctrine (1888) embrace four themes: sci-ence, theology, cosmogenesis, and anthropogenesis. Enoch is frequently men-tioned in these volumes, especially in the latter one.50 She calls him a sage and hierophant and interprets his visions as a document of initiation. Enoch’s association with the fallen Watchers gives occasion to Blavatsky to meditate on the double nature of Logos, ‘who is Wisdom but who, as the opponent of ignorance, is Satan or Lucifer at the same time’ (ibid.).Blavatsky recounted a number of things about Enoch which also turn up in Hooker’s novel. She called the Patriarch a mysterious cosmopolitan and identi-fied him as a generic mythogem, a representative of the Initiate, similar to (or identical with) the Egyptian Thoth, the Greek Hermes, the Latin Mercury, or the Arabic Idris. All of them are sacred writers, Recorders of Occult and an-cient Wisdom (ibid.). Blavatsky reminds her reader of the story of Enoch told by Josephus, ‘namely that he had concealed under the pillars of Mercury or Seth his precious rolls or books’ (ibid.) and develops her idea about the com-mon roots of sacred and satanic wisdom, arguing that the etymology of Satan can be related to Thoth, Tat, Set, Sat – and these are all one and the same as Hermes [Trismegistos].51 Blavatsky’s speculations and her introduction of the terms Right Hand Path and Left Hand Path point in another direction: to Aleis-ter Crowley’s “Enochian Magick” which opened up yet another duality in the twentieth century.52 Strictly speaking, Crowley’s career started in the Victorian period, since he was initiated by Golden Dawn adept, MacGregor Mathers, in Paris in 1898. But it was not until his vision quest in the Algerian desert in 1909 that Crowley seriously started experimenting with magical invocations that led him back to John Dee’s Enochian magic which he reinterpreted as “magick”.53 Crowley’s system was tinted with elements of Egyptian mysticism, but while for Dee the mystery of the hieroglyphs was most important, Crowley turned his attention toward ancient Egyptian religion, preaching the change from the aeon of Osiris to that of Horus. Crowley heralded the new century and its modern, radical individuality with an esoteric-magical program, sum-marized in The Book of the Law by his famous maxim, ‘Do What Thou Wilt.’However, this is already the modern cultural history of Enoch, although rooted in the Victorian world. From the First World War onward we see the 50 Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine, 2: 229–30.51 Concerning the identification of Enoch and Hermes Trismegistos, see above my refer-ences to the Arabic and medieval transmission.52 See DuQuette, The Magick of Aleister Crowley; Asprem, Arguing with Angels.53 See Asprem, Arguing with Angels, 85–97."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Szönyi290<UN>same fascination with Enoch as before, showing the same diversity of interests and cultural symbolizations.On the one hand the new traditionalists, such as Dmitri Merezhkovsky (1865–1941), Béla Hamvas (1897–1968), and René Guénon (1886–1951) glorified Enoch for his bold apocalypticism;54 and on the other post-Crowleyan magic, with offshoots to modern Satanism (from the Left Hand Path to Anton Szan-dor LaVey’s Church of Satan and Dr. Aquino’s Temple of Set), continues to use Enochian magical incantations.This forking, alternative interpretation has its modern artistic representa-tions, too. In Kevin Smith’s cult-film, Dogma (1999) Metatron is the glorious deputy of God, while in Philip Pullman’s fantasy trilogy, His Dark Materials (1995–2000), the translated Enoch is the archetypal evil, usurper of God and tyrant of humanity.55*****In conclusion, emphases should be made as follows. The character and the mythogem of Enoch has been fascinating humans since antiquity. The story of the Patriarch is complex and manifold, its different elements have been used for different agendas through different systems of cultural representations and symbolizations. The fact that he was “righteous” and because of this moral superiority was privileged to meet God face to face highlighted him as a role model for the believers. This inspired the genre of funeral speeches comparing the deceased person (mostly pastors) to the Patriarch, who ‘walked with God’. The Book(s) of Enoch are full of apocalyptic admonitions and visions which brought Enoch close to radical and subversive tendencies within Christianity (and Judaism). A special element in the Enoch-complex is the story of the reb-el angels (Watchers), their mating with the Daughters of Men, the disastrous offspring, the giants, and the ensuing cataclysmic punishment of God. This has been intriguing for two reasons. Partly, as a fascinating, thrilling story the kind which have always been coveted in popular literature, and since they were con-nected with a Biblical story, writers and artists felt authorized to recycle them. But furthermore, the story of the Watchers also offered an alternative to the Fall in the Garden of Eden. Here it was not the humans who became respon-sible for transgressing God’s law, but the angels whose seduction the humans 54 See the Bibliography for the works of Guénon, Hamvas, Merezhkovsky.

His life’s work encompassed a surprisingly diverse spectrum of activity, from the creation of alchemically stained glass to the archaeology, architectonics and symbolic analysis of Egyp-tian temples.1 Taken in its entirety, however, the esotericism of de Lubicz is nothing less than a science of consciousness. The perception of all phenomenal things, ‘from mineral to man’, as arrested phases of a living cosmic alchemical reaction was, for Schwaller, the cornerstone of his panentheistic Weltanschau-ung. Herein, everything that exists—the phenomenal world as a whole—was seen precisely as a reaction to a metaphysical action. ‘Life’ for Schwaller was ‘the faculty of reacting’,2 and this included the mineral and metallic kingdoms. ‘The Universe is nothing but consciousness’, he remarks, ‘and through its appear-ances presents nothing but an evolution of consciousness, from its origin to its end, the end being a return to its cause’.3 It is within this framework that we must begin to situate Schwaller’s approach to symbolism.This essay will focus on three interrelated ideas in Schwaller’s œuvre: (1) the concept of symbolique, in which the phenomenal cosmos is perceived as a reaction to metaphysical processes; (2) the basis of this idea in the alchemi-cal theory of sulphur, mercury, and salt; and (3) Schwaller’s conception of the alchemical stone as a ‘juncture of transcendence and concretion’. Following this, we will conclude with a few remarks on the significance of Schwaller’s alchemy as a simultaneously operative and spiritual process. Before we turn to the dynamics of Lubiczian symbolique proper, however, we will first provide a detailed biographical survey in order to situate Schwaller in his intellectual and historical contexts.41 I refer principally to the French editions of Schwaller de Lubicz’s works, and secondarily to the translations by Robert and Deborah Lawlor where I have consulted them.2 Schwaller de Lubicz, Le Temple dans L’Homme; Lawlor, 28.3 Schwaller de Lubicz, Le Temple de L’Homme, vol. 1, 61; Lawlor, 31 (emphasis per original): ‘De ce fait l’Univers n’est que Conscience et ne présente sous ses apparences qu’une évolution de conscience, de l’origine à sa fin qui est retour à sa cause’.4 A more detailed bio-bibliographic presentation is given in my doctoral dissertation: Cheak, Light Broken through the Prism of Life, 170–263.

The components of this reaction are so photosensi-tive that diffuse light will make them react, while direct sunlight will spark a violent explosion. The remarkable photosensitivity of the reaction crystallised Schwaller’s quest to comprehend the catalytic role of light and fire in alchemy, as well as the significance of colour as a means of knowing what Goethe called the ‘acts and sufferings of light’.7As a young adult, Schwaller fled to Paris to evade military service in the German empire, and in the early 1910s he became a student of Henri Matisse. During this period, there was a large degree of cross-fertilisation between L’Académie Matisse and Henri Bergson’s lectures at the Sorbonne. As a con-sequence, Schwaller was deeply informed not only by Matisse’s experiments is that of his wife: Isha Schwaller de Lubicz, ‘Aor’: Sa vie, son æuvre. Brief surveys of Schwaller’s life and/or work are contained in Pierre Mariel, Dictionnaire des sciences occultes en occident, 392–396; and more recently, Jean-Pierre Laurant’s entry, ‘Schwaller de Lubicz’, in the Dic-tionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism, 1045–1046. Useful introductory materials have also been furnished for the English translations of Schwaller’s works, in particular: Nature Word, Numbers, and The Temple in Man. Recently, Sablé’s La Vie et l’œuvre de R.A. Schwaller de Lu-bicz has provided an attempt to situate Schwaller’s life and work in terms of his consistent emphasis on the esoteric laws of genesis, which are discernible from his earliest writings to his last. However, the best critical apparatus to date has been provided in 2006 by Dufour-Kowalski’s two compilations of Schwaller’s material: L’Œuvre au rouge; and La Quête alchi-mique. Dufour-Kowalski avails himself of the significant documentary evidence preserved in the Ta Meri Archives, Schwaller’s Nachlass. This body of material seems to have passed to Dufour-Kowalski’s care after previously being tended by Olivier Robichon and Thérese Col-let. A particularly important source is André VandenBroeck’s memoir, Al-Kemi, in which the author describes eighteen months he spent in more or less daily contact with Schwaller in 1959–1960 (shortly before Schwaller’s death).5 Isha Schwaller de Lubicz, Aor, 14: ‘partageant ses loisirs entre les rêveries dans la forêt, la peinture et les expériences de chimie dans le laboratoire de son père’.6 VandenBroeck, Al-Kemi, 198–199.7 Goethe, Zur Farbenlehre (Vorwort): ‘Die Farben sind Taten des Lichtes, Taten und Leiden’."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Cheak298<UN>in colour as a pure phenomenon, which sought to convey the life beyond the mere appearance, but also by Bergson’s concept of the élan vital (the vital spark or impulse).8 As a student of Matisse, Schwaller learned that the physical world (the world of colour) traces the invisible ‘movements’ of the metaphysi-cal, and that the aim of the true artist is not to capture the visible phenomenon but to convey its spiritual impulse. Because the metaphysical is unable to be perceived without this physical trace, and because the physical cannot exist without its metaphysical underpinning, any strict demarcation between the two is therefore impossible. For Schwaller, metaphysical cause and physical effect were ultimately poles of one continuum.Between 1913 and 1916, Schwaller frequented the French branch of the Theo-sophical Society and, in a much more clandestine manner, participated in the (then) flourishing Parisian alchemical revival. It was in the café Closerie des Lilas that he met the (later) legendary ‘Fulcanelli’ ( Jean Julien Champagne, also a painter and alchemist, b.1877). The two agreed to a secret collaboration that would span twenty years, pivoting on the Hermetic mysterium of ‘salt’, which they sought to demonstrate through a practical alchemical opus—the achievement of a ‘glass stained in its mass with the volatile spirit of metals’. Through this they sought to recreate the unique blues and reds of the medieval cathedrals.During World War One, Schwaller worked as a military chemist and, in the aftermath of the war, grouped together associates and collaborators to form Les Veilleurs (The Watchers, named after the apocryphal egregoroi who bequeathed the arts and sciences to humankind in the Book of Enoch). The Veilleurs were dedicated to the revitalisation of war-torn, industrialised society by preserving the qualitative role of the artisan, which Schwaller regarded as the soul of a ci-vilisation. According to Schwaller, one of the aims of the Veilleurs ‘was to assist demobilised artisans in finding the opportunity to readapt to a new life guided by a sense that was mystical rather than purely economic’.9 During this period Schwaller published essays in Le Théosophe (The Theosopher) and L’Affranchi (The Awakened, an organ of Les Veilleurs), and produced a small monograph on Pythagorean arithmosophy entitled Étude sur les Nombres (A Study on Numbers). However, his earliest work was in fact a Hermetic reading of the 8 For Bergson, ‘consciousness was coextensive with life’; contrary to teleology (finalisme) and mechanism, Bergson’s élan vital offered a vital and creative explanation of evolution, hold-ing that life ceaslessly creates increasingly complex forms in an unpredictable fashion; see Bergson, L’Évolution créatrice.

The final form of the text, which bears encrypted insights into the practical alchemical opus, must be recognised as a fluid amalgam of (1) Schwaller’s material on the alchemical symbolique of the cathedrals; (2) numerous symbolic digressions on the ‘phonetic kabbalah’ adapted from the work of classicist and alchemist, Pierre Dujols (1862–1926); and (3) the overall presentation of Champagne himself, who also furnished the illustrations.11On 10 January 1919, the Lithuanian poet Oskar Wladislas de Lubicz Milosz (1877–1939) bequeathed to René Schwaller, then aged 31, the right to bear the noble title and arms of the clan Bozawola (Bozawola, ‘will of god’), also known as de Lubicz.12 Milosz, a noble and diplomat, was one of Schwaller’s closest friends; together the two formed the Centre apostolique within the Veilleurs to give expression to an apocalyptic form of mysticism; Milosz was also one of the few people to whom Schwaller conveyed his Hermetic philosophy at the time, reflections of which would surface in the poem Milosz dedicated to Schwaller: Le Cantique de la Connaissance (The Canticle of Gnosis).13 However, it was Schwaller’s efforts in assisting Milosz in securing Lithuanian independence that most deeply indebted the diplomat to Schwaller. In the aftermath of the First World War, Milosz was deeply affected by the post-war plight of his father-land, then in danger of being subsumed by the encroaching Bolshevik state. Schwaller assisted Milosz in devising the diplomatic strategy that successfully convinced the allied forces to restore the country’s former borders, thereby se-curing the continued political and cultural identity of Lithuania.14 In a moving 10 For the account of the Cathédrales theft: VandenBroeck, Al-Kemi, 78–81.11 Pierre Dujols directed the rituals of the Ordre du Temple Rénové founded by René Guénon in 1905; Dujols provided Jean-Julien Champagne with the Hermetic philological mate-rial that would appear in the two books published under the name Fulcanelli.

Complete with laboratory, forge, looms, printing press, and observatory, Suhalia was a hive of artisanal, alchemical, artistic, homeopathic, and mystical activity. Schwaller published a handful of rare works here, to include an Egyptian Tarot deck illustrated by his soon-to-be step-daughter, Lucy Lamy, who would go on to furnish the elegant, geometri-cally exacting illustrations to Schwaller’s Egyptological works. In addition to alchemical and homeopathic preparations, he is said to have invented a hydro-dynamic yacht, and a motor that ran on vegetable oil.17Over five nights in the winter of 1926, ‘from the height of a frozen, flame-red peak’, Schwaller received an apocalyptic revelation from a metaphysical presence called ‘Aor’ (a name that Schwaller would henceforth be known by among his closest associates). This revelation was published the following year as L’Appel du Feu (The Call of Fire). Although Schwaller did not indulge in the Parisian alchemists’ penchant for the ‘phonetic kabbalah’, a deep note of reso-nance would nevertheless have been struck for him between the name Aor (the Hebrew word for ‘light’) and the French word for ‘gold’ (or, from Latin au-rum). Indeed, in one text, gold is considered precisely by Schwaller as ‘metallic Light’ (Lumière métallique).18 Aor is best understood as a tutelary intelligence or Socratic daimon with which Schwaller communed. Among other things, Aor’s ‘call of fire’ exhorted Schwaller to go beyond dualistic consciousness, and as such, it cast the seeds for what he would later call ‘the intelligence of the 15 O.W. de Lubicz Milosz to René Schwaller, 10 January 1919: ‘Usant d’un droit qui a appartenu à mes ancêtres, je me fais une joie de donner à mon frère René Schwaller une marque de mon estime et un témoignage de mon amour en le recevant dans le clan dont fait partie ma famille, et en lui conférant le droit d’en porter les armoiries, dénommées Lubicz, avec la variante Bozawola, ou « Volonté de Dieu »’; ‘Bearing a right which belongs to my ances-tors, it is a pleasure to bequeath unto my brother René Schwaller a mark of my esteem and a testimony of my love by receiving him into the clan and therefore making him a part of my family, and to confer to him the right to bear the arms entitled Lubicz, with the variant Bozawola, or “Will of God”.’16 Nietzsche, Ecce Homo (Warum ich so gute Bücher schreibe: Also Sprach Zarathustra, §1): ‘6000 Fuss jenseits von Mensch und Zeit’.17 Isha Schwaller de Lubicz, A o r.18 Schwaller de Lubicz, ‘Le Naos dans le jardin’, Notes et propos inédits, vol. 1, 200."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"301The Juncture of Transcendence and Concretion<UN>heart’ (l’intelligence du cœur). This is the Hermetic epistemology that he would trace to the mentalité of the Egyptian sages.In 1927, Schwaller married the recently widowed Jeanne Lamy, who would become known as ‘Isha’. Both Isha and her former husband (George Lamy) had been close members of Schwaller’s circle since the days of the Veilleurs. In con-junction with his marriage to Isha, Schwaller published Adam L’Homme Rouge (Adam the Red Man), a work on the conjugal mystery and the metaphysics of eros, bearing a distinct anti-Catholic polemic. The extended title of the work gives an adequate indication of its contents:Adam: The Red Man, or the elements of a gnosis for perfect marriage; A work divided into two parts of which the first examines the moral situ-ation and the vital crisis created in human society by the domination of Catholicism, and the second part presents the fundamental notions of an occult teaching in order to enable the human couple to discover a basis which is philosophical and conformed to evolution in marriage, the goal of which is to attain spiritual union.19At Suhalia, many matters central to Schwaller’s mature work would mani-fest for the first time, to include an intensification of his collaboration with Champagne on the stained glass œuvre. By the turn of the 1930s, however, the financial support for the enterprise at Suhalia drew to a close. With Isha’s in-heritance, the Lubiczs secured a villa in the South of France on the Plan-de-Grasse, which Isha dubbed ‘Lou Mas du Coucagno’. It was here, in 1931–1932, that the stained glass œuvre was finally accomplished with the assistance of Champagne, shortly before the latter’s death.Schwaller’s library and laboratory, which were preserved at Lou Mas du Cou-cagno for some years after René and Isha’s death, contained all the resources of a practicing alchemist. His library contained not only alchemical texts but also serious, scientific sourceworks, while his laboratory contained numerous mineralogical, metallic, and chemical specimens, as well as ovens, furnaces, 19 St. Moritz: Éditions Montalia, 1927: ‘Adam: L’Homme Rouge, ou les élements d’une gnose pour le mariage parfait; Ouvrage divisé en deux parties dont la première examine la situation morale et la crise vitale créées dans la société humaine par la domination du catholicisme et la deuxième partie présente les notions fondamentales d’un enseigne-ment occulte pour permettre au couple humain de trouver une base philosophique et conforme à l’évolution dans le marriage dont le but est d’atteindre l’union spirituelle’.

The laboratory was also notably equipped with a spectrometer in order to study the spectral lines given forth from metals, attesting to the fact that colour phenom-enon continued to be crucial to his alchemical work.In 1934, the Lubiczs set out on the Mediterranean on a hydrodynamic yacht designed by Schwaller. In the same year they settled on the Spanish island of Majorca in a hospice dating to the time of Ramon Lull (1232–1315), and a pe-riod of isolation ensued. In 1936 however, with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the Lubiczs were forced to move on and their affinities drew them to Egypt, where they would remain for the next fifteen years. In Egypt, Schwaller had a crucial impression that crystallised the connection between Egyptian civilisation and the Pythagorean-Hermetic tradition, thereby bringing his al-chemical quest directly into contact with its perceived Pharaonic sources.The experience occurred in 1936 in the tomb of Ramses ix, where Schwaller beheld an Osirian mural depicting Ka-Mut-Tef (‘the bull of his mother’). Here the Pharaoh is shown as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, simultane-ously embodying both the masculine-generative and the feminine-gestative power of the cosmos. This theme—in which an ‘agent’ becomes both the fa-ther and mother of itself, lay at the very heart of his alchemical metaphysics. From that moment on, Schwaller knew he had found the true symbolique of his magnum opus: Le Temple de L’Homme (The Temple of Man, 1957–1958), a work that gestated over a dozen years of on-site measurement, decipherment and study of the temple of Amenemopet at Luxor, Upper Egypt, confirming for Schwaller that this lineage was indeed the font of the Hermetic, Pythag-orean, and alchemical tradition of which he was already a seasoned—and practicing—adept. In order to devote himself to this tradition, Schwaller and his entourage set themselves up in a wing of the Winter Palace on the Nile at Luxor—where, over a period of twelve years, he was able to live in daily con-tact with the temples.20Schwaller’s alchemical reading of the French cathedrals—long understood as architectonic images of Christ—Hermetically disposed him to approach the New Kingdom Egyptian temple as a codification of the incarnation of god 20 The colonial era Winter Palace, so-named for being the winter residence of the Egyptian Royal Family, subsequently became host to a wealth of illustrious visitors.

He maintained that the foundational teaching underpinning every symbolic detail of the temple, governing and shaping its entire structure at every level, from its foundation and its axes to its material substances and its form, was ‘the doctrine of the anthropocosmos’. In no un-certain terms, Schwaller calls the temple at Luxor ‘the temple of man’. This is not merely because the structure of the temple could be correlated with the biometrical proportions of the royal corpus—the image of the pharaoh—but because the Egyptian divine temple itself, like the pharaoh, is the structure that supports the incarnation of divinity.22 The temple of man corporifies the divine functions or principles (neters), both as a physical edifice created ac-cording to divine proportions of gnomonic growth, and literally through the embodiment of the divine in man. For Schwaller, human physiology is a physi-cal product of metaphysical principles; as such, the organs of human percep-tion, from the physical to the subtle, are at the same time the instruments of divine self-perception. Overall, Schwaller emphasised how a profound anthro-pocosmic philosophy was encoded in every physical aspect of the construction of the Egyptian divine temple, and, more than this, that a profoundly intui-tive, a-rational intelligence, superior to our own divisive rationalism, lay at the heart of Egyptian civilisation.These views clashed dramatically with the attitudes of contemporary Egyp-tology. Despite this, the sheer gravity of Schwaller’s research and the compel-ling originality of his interpretations attracted a significantly high calibre of support from both the academic and artistic communities. Schwaller’s key as-sociates during this period became known as Le Groupe de Louxor (not to be confused with the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor). Among others, Le Groupe de Louxor was comprised of the Egyptologist Alexandre Varille, the Architect Clément Robichon, and the official guardian of the Valley of the Kings, Al-exandre Stoppeläre. The Groupe de Louxor supported and participated with Schwaller in the generally unknown but virulent polemic that transpired dur-ing this period between the ‘symbolist’ approach to Egyptology (represented by Schwaller and Varille) and the hostile climate of conservative Egyptology 21 The broader premise is that the temple at Luxor provided the model of the Greek temples/churches that consequently formed the basis of the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages.22 This point is in fact consistent with the views of current Egyptology. See in particular the exemplary work of Lanny Bell on the pivotal role of Luxor temple in the Opet festival: Bell, ‘Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal Ka’, jnes 44, no. 4 (1985): 251–294; ‘The New Kingdom ‘Divine’ Temple: The Example of Luxor’, in Temples of Ancient Egypt, 127–184."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Cheak304<UN>headed by the highly influential Catholic abbot, archaeologist, and Director of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo, Étienne Drioton. In 1949, avant-garde dra-matist and filmmaker Jean Cocteau entered this milieu and, perceiving the significance of the symbolist method, popularised de Lubicz’s cause in the French literary media. Figures such as André Rousseaux, Raoul Jahan, Pierre Rambach and François Hébert-Stevens followed suit, and as a result of this, Schwaller would be invited to present at André Breton’s Congrès des Symbol-istes (1956–1959) upon his return to France.23 (Here Schwaller presented an im-portant paper on his concept of symbolique). Although scholars such as Arpag Mekhitarian called for a balanced appraisal of the actual evidence to resolve the impasse, the appeal was treated with a front of silence. Ultimately, despite being reviewed and published in the most prestigious of Egyptological jour-nals, Schwaller’s work was tacitly ignored by mainstream Egyptology.24 Tragi-cally, in 1951, Alexandre Varille died in a car accident, and without the support of their chief academic spokesperson, the symbolists were forced to secede.25Notable works produced by the symbolists during this period include Varille’s Dissertation sur une Stèle Pharaonique (Dissertation on a Pharaonic Stele, 1946), and two works by Schwaller: Le Temple dans L’Homme (The Temple in Man, 1949), a précis or ‘preface’ to the three-volume magnum opus of 1957, and Du Symbol et de la symbolique (On Symbol and Symbology, 1951),26 an at-tempt at deepening the meaning of symbolism through the concept of symbol-ique, described by Schwaller elsewhere as a ‘mathematology of phenomena’.2723 Cocteau, Maalesh: Journal d’une tournée de théâtre; Rousseaux, ‘A Louksor, la guerre froide est déclarée entre symbolistes et historiens’, Le Figaro Littéraire, 8 avril (1950); ‘La querelle des Egyptologues’, Le Mercure de France, July 1951; ‘Présence de l’ancienne Egypte’, Cahiers du Sud 50, no. 358 (Décembre 1960–Janvier 1961): 323–326; Rambach, Jahan and Hébert-Stevens, Du Nil au Gange a la découverte de l’Inde; Mekhitarian, ‘A propos du « Temple de L’Homme »’, Cahiers du Sud 50, no. 358 (Décembre 1960–Janvier 1961): 327–347.

In 1952, on the day of St. John the Baptist, Schwaller penned an intriguing text entitled Verbe Nature (Nature Word), perhaps one of his most deeply revealing works.28 The subtitle of the work is: Quelques réponses de la Nature et de ses Sages aux questions de l’auteur, porte-parole des inconnus (Some responses from Nature and her Sages to the ques-tions of the author, spokesperson of the unknown). Bearing the distinct stamp of Schwaller’s mysterious daimon, the premise of the text is the transcription of a series of answers given by ‘Nature and her sages’ to questions posed, but not recorded, by Schwaller. It is thus composed solely of responses.It was in Plan-de-Grasse that Schwaller finally completed and published his three-volume magnum opus, Le Temple de l’homme (1957–1958), the magisteri-al synthesis of his many years of on-site study in the temples of Egypt. Just after his chef d’œuvre appeared, a Belgian-American by the name of André Vanden-Broeck encountered Schwaller’s work and, over a period of eighteen months, became his last, and perhaps most important, ‘disciple’. The account that Van-denBroeck left of this period (1959–1960), published some twenty-seven years later on the centenary of Schwaller’s birth (Al-Kemi: Hermetic, Occult, Political, and Private Aspects of R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, 1987), remains the single most important memoir of Schwaller de Lubicz to date. It is also one of the most important sources for understanding his alchemy.29The final works published by de Lubicz were Le Roi de la Théocratie Phara-onique (The King of Pharaonic Theocracy, 1956), a work which, among other things, traces the deviation and distortion of Egyptian consciousness through Greek rationality, highlighting the Egyptian rather than Greek basis of the in-tellectual ‘miracle’ that transformed antique civilisation, and Propos sur Éso-térisme et Symbole (On Esotericism and Symbol, 1960), a short text written during Christmas, 1947, and dedicated to his ‘friends from the Luxor group’. Propos sur Ésotérisme et Symbole reflects many of the themes explored in the wealth of notes and unpublished papers that Schwaller wrote throughout the 1940s, and remains one of his most profound meditations on metaphysics.30 In his final years Schwaller made a brief trip to his birthplace in Alsace, and, 28 Given the day of its composition, the title clearly indicates the logos of John 1:1 (en arche ēn logos; the standard French translation of logos is Verbe).29 For a detailed survey of Lubiczian alchemy proper, see Cheak, ‘Agent of All Mutations: Metallurgical, Biological and Spiritual Evolution in the Alchemy of René Schwaller de Lubicz’, in Alchemical Traditions, 458–517.30 For the previously unpublished essays, see Schwaller de Lubicz, Lettres à un disciple de R.A.

Although Schwaller would often use symbol-ique in the first sense, speaking for instance of a ‘Christic’ or ‘Pharaonic’ sym-bolique, it is his theory of symbols and his hermeneutics that is of principle interest to the present study.Schwaller’s concept of symbolique involves the perception of the eternal origin through the medium of transient phenomena. Against convention-al symbols, which are merely arbitrary associations, Schwaller defined the true symbol as the physical effect of a metaphysical cause.32 More than this, he defined the symbol as that which magically evokes and thus expresses or manifests the metaphysical principle that created it. ‘In every function’, re-marks Schwaller, ‘there is that moment that cannot be situated in time that I call the ‘present moment’. It is this esoteric moment with which symbolique is concerned’.33At the root of this conception is the idea that every phenomenal thing is formed by a ‘specification of energy’ into a perceptible form.34 This process of specification is described in terms of a ‘will’ or ‘seed’—i.e., a specifier—that acts upon an unspecified energy or milieu in order to create the resulting form. The specifying power is frequently likened to a ‘fire’ that coagulates an unformed substance into the nature specified by the fire. All volumetric expression, i.e., 31 Isha Schwaller de Lubicz was a significant Egyptosophical author in her own right. Her publications include Pois chiche: Visage vivant de l’ancienne Égypte; Her-Bak: ‘Disciple’ de la sagesse Égyptienne; L’Ouverture du chemin; and La Lumière du chemin.32 Schwaller de Lubicz, Temple de L’Homme, vol. 1, 86; Lawlor, 48: ‘Every symbol, even one beyond interpretation, is in itself directly related to the thing that it expresses—that it is—that it represents perhaps, but certainly through that which it evokes. Thus wings can be nothing other than what evokes the fact of flying. That which flies can be nothing other than what rises and escapes the earth; this can be nothing other than the volatile principle, one of the principles of the original separation’.33 Temple, i, 97; Lawlor, 54: ‘Il y a, en toute fonction, ce moment insituable dans le Temps que j’appelle « Moment Présent ». C’est ce moment ésotérique dont s’occupe la symbolique’.34 Temple, i, 86; Lawlor, 48."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"307The Juncture of Transcendence and Concretion<UN>all expression that gestates in time and space, originates for Schwaller from the interaction between the fire, will, or seed, and the substance upon which this ‘fire’ acts. The result is a specified form or phenomenon, which is the living symbol of the metaphysical interaction that created it. There are thus three aspects to the process: the specifying fire or ‘function’, the unspecified ‘sub-stance’, and the specified ‘form’ proper.Function, substance and form are thus comparable to (1) the seed that de-termines the species; (2) the matrix, ground, or womb that nourishes it (and in which it gestates); and (3) the fruit, product, or final culmination of this pro-cess. When a seed or ‘fire’ specifies its nourishing milieu into form, the material genesis of that form—the process that unfolds in time and space—is consid-ered by Schwaller to be an analysis of the potential synthesised in the seed. The ‘seed’ is thus the latent or virtual potential while the ‘tree’ is the analysis of this potential. Importantly for Schwaller’s philosophy, the synthesis precedes the analysis. In other words, the phenomenon exists entire in a virtual state before the actualised expression. From this example, Schwaller moves to the concept of the semence universel, the ‘universal seed’ of which all phenomena in the known universe are particular analyses. Just as a particular seed, the seed of an apple for instance, contains the whole tree in an unactualised state, the universal seed contains the entire cosmos, including all its particular seeds, in an unactualised state. Moreover, the particular seeds are themselves symbols, analyses, of the potentials contained in the universal seed. Therefore, nothing exists, nothing is symbolised, that is not contained in the universal seed.For this reason, the three aspects of the symbolic process relate closely to the three fundamental phases or aspects of Schwaller’s cosmology. For Schwaller, the phenomenal cosmos in its entirety is a reaction to a primordial, metaphysical action. This primordial action is the scission of unity—a ‘rupture in the [primordial] equilibrium’35—through which the primordial unity (‘non-polarised energy’) is polarised into two unequal but complementary parts. The unique causal unity thus polarises itself and then acts upon itself to cause the reaction that is the constant genesis of the living cosmos. Physical existence itself, in all its permutations, thus results from the active aspect of the primor-dial polarity (its metaphysical function or ‘seed’) acting upon its passive com-plement (its proto-physical ‘womb’). The result of this metaphysical action is ‘specification into form’.35 Temple, vol. 1, 172: ‘La Nature est la conséquence d’une rupture de l’équilibre de l’Unité, une désharmonie de la sérénité originelle qui nous échappe’; Lawlor 103: ‘Nature is the consequence of a rupture in the equilibrium of Unity, a disharmony of the original equa-nimity, which escapes us’."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Cheak308<UN>True to the concept of symbolique, the examples that Schwaller uses to illus-trate this principle are not merely metaphors, but manifestations of the ever-present cosmogonic scission, which is understood to be constantly occurring at all levels of the phenomenal world, from mitosis in cells (where unity gener-ates multiplicity by division), to the mathematical function of phi (in which division into two unequal parts creates a harmonious proportion which forms the gnomonic basis of organic growth).The interaction of polarities results in manifest forms that express or evoke this metaphysical process, and a large part of Schwaller’s genius resides in how he articulates the threefold nature of this process in terms of its embodiment in natural phenomena. A few examples will serve to illustrate.In Propos sur Ésotérisme et Symbole, Schwaller uses a revealing ‘rustic’ ex-ample to show how the polarities at play are different intensities of one activ-ity. In particular, he emphasises that when the nonpolarised energy polarises itself, ‘the thing that opposes itself must be of the same nature as the activity’:Suppose we take milk as an example of a perfectly homogenous milieu; if the fatty substance now rises to form cream on top of the milk, this ho-mogeneity is ruptured. Eventually there will be a little bit of watery milk and some butter. There will have been division, the active manifesting itself by opposition [to the passive]. Now the active will have been an en-ergetic state that we call acid. This acid is comprehensible as a provoker of the separation of the homogenous milieu into water and fat; but from the very first separation there will be an ‘active’ [energy] and an ‘obstacle’ because the acidic energy will have [already] acted, finding in this mi-lieu the possibility to act, that is to say, [there are already] two separable things. Then the liquid milk will manifest itself in its components, each of which will have a well-defined character, and there will no longer be any strong disagreement between them, even though they come from the same thing.3636 Schwaller de Lubicz, Propos sur Ésotérisme et Symbole, 58–59: ‘Il faut que la chose qui s’oppose soit de même nature que l’activité. [...] Supposons, par exemple, que le lait soit un milieu parfaitement homogène, si maintenant la substance grasse monte en crème sur le lait, cette homogénéité est rompue. Il y aura finalement un petit-lait aquatique et du beurre. Il y aura eu division, l’actif se sera manifesté par opposition. Or l’actif aura été un état énergétique que l’on appelle acide. Cet acide sera compréhensible en tant que provocateur de la séparation du milieu homogène en eau et grasse; mais dès la première intime séparation il y aura « actif » et « obstacle » parce que l’énergie acide aura agi, trou-vant dans ce milieu la possibilité d’agir, c’est-à-dire deux choses séparables. Alors le lait liquide se sera manifesté dans ses composants dont chacun aura un caractère bien défini,"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"309The Juncture of Transcendence and Concretion<UN>The phenomenon at play in the natural separation of milk is thus a symbol in the Lubiczian sense because its physical processes embody the metaphysical functions. We can see a principle of unity (a ‘nonpolarised energy’, or ‘homog-enous milieu’) separating itself into two natures, one acidic or ‘fiery’ and the other alkaline or ‘aquatic’.37 Importantly, these apparently different natures are merely different intensities of one energy or activity. The acidic energy of the milk will evoke an alkaline complement (the cream), which, relatively speak-ing, is the ‘least acid’.38 For Schwaller, the natural cosmos as a whole is a prod-uct of this kind of interaction, not only on a metaphysical level, but also in every particular instance.In his chef d’œuvre, he illustrates the dynamics of the process with the image of embryogenesis:In biology, the great mystery is the existence, in all living beings, of al-bumin or albuminoid (proteinaceous) matter. [...] The spermatozoon therefore plays the role of a ‘vital coagulating fire’ just as common fire coagulates the feminine albumin. [...] Ordinary fire brutally coagulates the white of an egg, but the spermatozoon coagulates it gently by specify-ing it into the embryo of its species. This image shows that the potenti-ality of the seed passes to a defined effect through the coagulation of a passive substance, similar to the action of an acid liquid in an alkaline liquid, which forms a specified salt. Now the sperm is no more acid than the male albumin, but it plays in the animal kingdom [animalement] the same role as acid; ordinary fire is neither male nor acid and yet it has a type of male and acid action. This and other considerations incline the philosopher to speak of an Activity that is positive, acid, and coagulat-ing, without material carrier, and of a Passivity, a substance that is nega-tive, alkaline, and coagulable, also without material carrier. From their interaction results the initial, not-yet-specified coagulation, the threefold Unity, which is also called the ‘Creative Logos’ (Word) because the Logos, as speech, only signifies the name, that is, the definition of the ‘specific-ity’ of things.39et ils ne seront plus du tout d’accord, quoiqu’ils viennent d’une même chose.

Schwaller uses a number of in-terchangeable terms for the three aspects of this process, but the important point is that each of these three principles is to be understood functionally. That is to say, the image used to express the principle could vary (e.g., seed, acid), but the fundamental activity remained the same. The specifying func-tion, for instance, was often described as a fire, but as Schwaller shows, this is not always to be taken literally:It can only be a matter of an active Fire, that is, of a seminal ‘intensity’, like the ‘fire’ of pepper, for example, or better: the ‘fire’ of either an organic or a catalysing ferment. The character of all ferments, i.e., seeds, is to deter-mine into Time and Space a form of nourishment—in principle without form; clearly, therefore, it plays a coagulating role. The coagulation of all ‘bloods’ is precisely their fixation into the form of the species of the co-agulating seed, the coagulation being, as in other cases, a transformation of an aquatic element into a terrestrial or solid element, without desicca-tion and without addition or diminution of the component parts.40The whole point of every phenomenal symbol was to evoke ‘through its static and concrete nature’, the ‘functional and qualitative whole’ from which it re-sults.41 The fixed phenomenon in time and space evokes its opposite, just as a colour (e.g., red) evokes its complement (green) as a visual after effect.42 For 40 Schwaller, ‘La semence’, Notes et propos inédits i, 44: ‘Il ne peut alors s’agir que d’un Feu actif, c’est-à-dire d’une « intensité » séminale, comme le « feu » du poivre, par exemple, ou bien le « feu » d’un ferment organique, ou bien d’un ferment catalyseur. Le caractère de tous les ferments, c’est-à-dire des semences, étant de déterminer en Temps et Espace une nourriture—en principe sans forme—, c’est donc nettement un rôle coagulant. La coagulation de tous les « sangs » étant précisément leur fixation en forme de l’espèce de la semence coagulante, la coagulation étant, par ailleurs, un changement d’un élément aquatique en élément terrestre ou solide, sans dessèchement, sans addition ou diminu-tion de composants’.41 Temple, vol. 1, 699; Lawlor, 477: ‘Le symbole, en tant que synthèse, évoque son caractère statique et concret l’ensemble fonctionnel et qualitative duquel il résulte, c’est-à-dire qu’il évoque sa définition insituable vitalement’.42 J.W. von Goethe famously noted the time he looked keenly at a pale-skinned, dark-haired (and well-endowed) girl in a scarlet bodice; when she moved away, the after-image of the bodice was sea-green; Zur Farbenlehre, §52: ‘Als ich gegen Abend in ein Wirtshaus eintrat und ein wohlgewachsenes Mädchen mit blendendweißem Gesicht, schwarzen Haaren"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"311The Juncture of Transcendence and Concretion<UN>Schwaller, this evocation entailed a vital ‘crossing’ (croissance). ‘The crossing that is figuratively transcribed by an x, or by the ‘reflection’ in a mirror’, re-marks Schwaller, ‘is, in reality, a ‘spiritual’ function analogous to the neutrali-sation of an acid by a base, which forms a salt’.43 What this means is that the interaction of the metaphysical polarities were able to be perceived through their neutralisation in concrete phenomena. Sulphur, Mercury, SaltThe symbolism of coagulation is distinctly alchemical and relates directly to Schwaller’s understanding of the Hermetic trinity: Sulphur, Mercury and Salt. These were understood not only in terms of the specific minerals or metals, which were themselves symbolic expressions, but also in terms of the underly-ing metaphysical functions that they evoked. Following Paracelsus, the three primaries (tria prima, drei Ersten) were identified with the Trinitarian concept in Christian theology.44 However, Schwaller’s understanding of the tria prima runs deeper, and is essentially consonant with the Trinitarian conceptions of Egyptian (and later Pythagorean) cosmogonic theology. Here, the creator’s di-vine hypostases—Hu, Sia and Heka—manifest as the extra- or hyper-cosmic forces that exist before creation; they are the personification of the creator’s und einem scharlachroten Mieder zu mir ins Zimmer trat, blickte ich sie, die in einiger Entfernung vor mir stand, in der Halbdämmerung scharf an. Indem sie sich nun darauf hinwegbewegte, sah ich auf der mir entgegenstehenden weißen Wand ein schwarzes Ge-sicht, mit einem hellen Schein umgeben, und die übrige Bekleidung der völlig deutlichen Figur erschien von einem schönen Meergrün’.43 Temple, vol. 1, 699; Lawlor, 477–478: ‘Le croisement qui se transcrit figurativement par x, en reflet du miroir, en croisement des sceptres de pharaon momifié, est, en réalité, une fonction spirituelle analogue a la neutralisation d’un acide par une base, formant un sel’.44 In Paracelsus’ writings, the tria prima are often compared to the three aspects that are present during the process of combustion (i.e. fire, smoke, ash): ‘Whatever burns is sul-phur, whatever is humid is mercury, and that which is the balsam of these two is salt’; Waite ed., i, 258–259. Paracelsians also employed the tria prima to represent the composi-tion of the human microcosm: spirit (mercury), soul (sulphur) and body (salt), and this correlation was extended to the Christian trinity: father (sulphur), holy spirit (mercury), son (salt). Cf. Paracelsus, ‘Concerning the Nature of Things’, Waite ed. i, 125: ‘For Mercury is the spirit, Sulphur is the soul, and Salt is the body’. ‘In this manner’, states Paracelsus, ‘in three things, all has been created [...] namely, in salt, in sulphur, and in liquid [mercury]. In these three things all things are contained, whether sensate or insensate [...] So too you understand that in the same manner that man is created [in the image of the triune God], so too all creatures are created in the number of the Trinity, in the number three’; Paracel-sus, Theologische und religionsphilosophische Schriften, ed.

They are thus forces necessary to the establishment of creation rather than instances of creation per se. Interestingly, the Egyptian conception is recapitulated in the Neoplatonic metaphysics of Iamblichean theurgy, which distinguishes be-tween hypercosmic and encosmic divinities, and the same essential principles are carried through into the Trinitarian theology of Byzantine Christianity in its distinction between uncreated and created energies.45 Significantly, all of these contexts influenced the historical genesis of western alchemy, so when Schwaller remarks that ‘Unity manifests itself as Trinity’, and that this Trinity is the ‘creatrix of form’, but still not ‘form itself ’, he is speaking in consonance with very ancient theological traditions.46The Trinity, that is to say the Three Principles, is the basis of all reasoning, and this is why in the whole ‘series of genesis’ it is necessary to have all [three] to establish the foundational Triad that will be[come] the partic-ular Triad. It includes first of all an abstract or nourishing datum, second-ly a datum of measure, rhythmisation and fixation, and finally, a datum that is concrete or fixed like seed. This is what the Hermetic philosophers have transcribed, concretely and symbolically, by Mercury, Sulphur and Salt, playing on the metallic appearance in which metallic Mercury takes the role of nutritive substance, Sulphur the coagulant of this Mercury, and Salt the fixed product of this function. In general, everything in na-ture, being a formed Species, will be Salt. Everything that coagulates a nourishing substance will be Sulphur or of the nature of Sulphur, from the chromosome to the curdling of milk. Everything that is coagulable will be Mercury, whatever its form.4745 On the influence of theurgy on early mystical Christianity, see especially Shaw, ‘Neopla-tonic Theurgy and Dionysius the Areopagite’, Journal of Early Christian Studies 7.4 (1999): 573–599; On created versus uncreated energies, see Lossky, The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church (St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press: Crestwood, ny, 1976).46 Schwaller de Lubicz, ‘Le monde de la trinité’, Notes et Propos inédits i, 64: ‘L’Unité se mani-feste comme Trinité.

When this occurs, the product is a salt. While more complex chemical definitions of salt can be given, this one, advanced by Guillaume Francois Rouelle in 1744,50 allows one to perceive the broader principles that intuitively motivated the alchemists to select salt as the mineral image of the interaction of sulphur and mercury (cin-nabar, HgS, a salt in the chemical sense).51 More precise chemical definitions specify that a salt is an electrically neutral ionic compound. The same prin-ciple of perfect equipoise between opposing energies prevails.

Cf. the contemporary definition in Lemery, Cours de Chymie (ed. Theodore Baron d’Henouville, Paris, 1675; reprinted 1756), 733–734: ‘The acid is always a solvent, when it is put in large enough quantity on the matter which we wish to dissolve; but it always makes a Coagulum, when as it is in too small a quantity its points have got stuck in the pores of the matter, and are far from having the strength to separate it in order to come out of it; this is what is seen when we pour some spirit of vitriol on liquor of salt of tartar; for if we put on only what is necessary to penetrate the salt, the acid points remain as if sheathed and they weigh down the body, which is why a coagulation and precipitation occur; but if we add to the liquor as much again of the spirit of vitriol as we had put on to it, or more, the Coagulum will disappear, because the little bodies, which when assembled together were holding up the acid and preventing its movements, will be separated and dissolved by the acid which has become stronger’.51 Comments Kurlansky (Salt, 300): ‘It turned out that salt was once a microcosm for one of the oldest concepts of nature and the order of the universe. From the fourth century bc Chinese belief in the forces of yin and yang, to most of the worlds religions, to modern science, to the basic principles of cooking, there has always been a belief that two oppos-ing forces find completion—one receiving a missing part and the other shedding an extra one.

When anions and cations bond to form an ionic compound whose electric charges are in equilibrium, they neutralise and the result is called a salt. The chemical defi-nition opens up the conception of salt beyond that of mere sodium chloride. Chemically, the coloured oxides and other reactions of metals—of especial significance to the alchemical perception—are often salts (the metal itself tak-ing the role of base; oxygen the acid).52In the language of western alchemy, salt embodies the ligature between the primordial polarities, sulphur and mercury, mineral theophanies which, together with salt, represent the three formative metaphysical principles that create the phenomenal world.53 Just as sulphur and mercury react to form a salt (cinnabar; mercuric sulphide), so too, for Schwaller, do meta-physical and proto-physical forces react to form the concrete world of visible, physical real-ity. Whereas sulphur was traditionally seen to impart soul, and mercury spirit, salt imparted but also embodied the principle of fixedness and solidity. Salt was conceived as the bedrock of physical existence, both the immutable principle and corruptible ‘body’ of any phenomenon. According to this schematic, salt is both the formative force and physical product, noumenon and phenome-non, straddling the realms of eternity and transience. The meaning of what Schwaller called ‘the Hermetic problem of Salt’54 thus inheres in its role as 52 Chemically, metal provides the cation; oxygen the anion. Alchemically, because the reac-tions of metals were coloured, they were important signifiers of the metal’s nature, often seen as an index of its spirit or tincture (cf. Greek ios, ‘violet/purple tincture or tarnish’). The seven planetary metals were often signified by their coloured salts, oxides, or other reactions: e.g. lead is white (hydrocerussite); iron, red (rust); copper is blue/green (verdi-gris); silver is black. Gold remains pure (unreacting) but its tincture was identified with royal purple (seen in the red-purple colour of colloidal gold or gold ruby glass).53 While sulphur and mercury have an alchemical history extending into antiquity, the ad-dition of salt—forming the tria prima (drei Ersten)—is usually attributed to Paraclesus (1493–1541). The deeper roots of the concept, however, appear to extend into Islamic al-chemical contexts. On Paracelsus and the tria prima, see in particular Weeks, Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541): Essential Theoretical Writings, 15–19, 29; Pagel, Paracelsus: An Introduction to Philosophical Medicine in the Era of the Renais-sance, 101.54 VandenBroeck, Al-Kemi, 81: ‘The Hermetic problem of our particular moment is Salt, but we have no good and complete texts from that point of view; we have good texts from the point of view of Sulphur and Mercury, but the shift in emphasis on the problem of"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"315The Juncture of Transcendence and Concretion<UN>juncture between metaphysical and physical realities. This, it is argued, cuts to the very core of the conception of matter in alchemy, irreversibly complicating the dualistic notions of ‘spiritual’ versus ‘material’ so central to empirical- historical dichotomisation. In a rare passage that drew the interest of Fulca-nelli’s amanuensis, Eugène Canseliet,55 Schwaller remarks:Why these bodies: sulphur, mercury and salt?—Because they are typical of what is possible. Sulphur, product of the fire of the earth; mercury, water of metals, or first terrestrial body; and salt, the stable state, and naturally the most widespread. On the other hand, sulphur coagulates mercury and forms a black and red salt. [...] There is a principle which acts, a principle which receives, and the two form, by mutual love—(the successive attraction and repulsion of generation)—the perfect salt which is Three in One, God in the trinity, called in the material work of the philosophers: the philosophical stone. Here the word ‘stone’ signifies symbolically the perfect form, the most enduring, the most ‘formal’, while the qualifier ‘philosophical’ signifies that it is to be understood in the sense of esoteric knowledge. Now, if the philosophical stone in the work of matter is the most perfect form, if it is the most intense fire, linked by the mercurial or feminine principle in a salt—or absolutely neutral body—the most perfect stone is, philosophically, God, who is the totality of his Trinity of all possibilities.56Salt is recent, since around the turn of the century, and in direct relationship with post-Newtonian physics and the crisis in Darwinism’.55 Eugene Canseliet to René Schwaller de Lubicz (December 4, 1933); reproduced in Dubois, Fulcanelli dévoilé, 159 ff.56 Schwaller de Lubicz, Adam L’Homme Rouge, 48–50: ‘Pourquoi ces corps: soufre, sel et mer-cure?—Parce qu’ils sont typiques au possible.

He sought a specific process believed to be germane to the very constitution of real-ity: to the ontological foundations of matter itself (i.e., a meta-physics). He sought the very act of transmutation in which spirit coagulated itself into concrete, material existence, which, in the final analysis, is no less than an act of constant cosmogenesis, of creation ex nihilo. This creative power was constant because it was not a one-off act at the beginning of time (a con-ception which presupposes a linear consciousness of time); rather it is to be understood as ever- present. For this reason, the perception of this re-ality is effectively available any time, here and now, and it is for this reason that Schwaller considered a rigidly historical basis of initiatory transmission as an important, but not absolutely necessary prerequisite to the perpetua-tion of this perception. It can, in effect, occur through a spontaneous break-through of metaphysical apperception in which the juncture of abstraction and concretion is directly grasped through the phenomenon of specifica-tion into form. This process, this perception, was ultimately equated with the alchemical salt:with the notion of salt, we are reaching a point that represents the limit of rational and irrational, where metaphysics and physics meet; it is a moment that can only be described as transcendent, yet it must remain inseparable from the concrete. It is not something that can be explained. But it can be shown, yet there is no guarantee that even when shown, you will see. For actually, the entire universe and every detail of it is such a juncture of transcendency with concreteness. So why don’t you see it right here and now?57 Symbolique as Phenomenology of SpiritGiven the significance of this ‘juncture of transcendency with concreteness’, Schwaller’s cosmogonic symbolique may be usefully understood as a form of phenomenology in the Hegelian sense. This is not surprising given the esoteric roots of Hegelian phenomenology, and here it should be pointed out that the term phaenomenologia (in German Phänomenologie), while often attributed to Kant, is not original to him. Kant appears to have gotten the term from the Swiss physicist, astronomer and mathematician, Johann Heinrich Lambert 57 Al-Kemi, 182–183."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"317The Juncture of Transcendence and Concretion<UN>(1728–1777), who was a correspondent of Kant’s.58 Interestingly for the study of esotericism, however, the earliest known evidence for the word phenomenol-ogy derives neither from Kant nor Lambert, but from the Swabian theosopher, Friedrich Christoph Oetinger (1702–1782).59 Oetinger’s theosophy, bordering closely on Naturphilosophie, viewed visible nature as a theophany (divine ap-pearance) and phenomenology as a procedure for displaying the ‘divine sys-tem of relations’.60 Indeed, it is from this deeper purview—the visible cosmos as theophany—that the phenomenology of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) would emerge: a figure whose indebtedness to the Hermetic tradi-tion has been well documented.61With one foot in Teutonic theosophy, and the other in academic philosophy, Hegel reacted to the inherent problems of the Kantian approach by regarding actual phenomenal processes (not only Natur, but also Geschichte, objective history) as indices of a holarchical, absolute consciousness (absoluter Geist).62 For Hegel, phenomenology is the science of the appearances of this absolute spirit. That is to say, all appearances—from naïve sense certainty and the per-ception of universals, to the distinction between appearance and reality—are so many manifestations of absolute spirit coming to know itself through the vehicle of human consciousness. Likewise, so-called ‘external reality’ as a whole—from natural evolution to the historical process—are also so many vehicles of this same dialectic.In effect, both subjectivity and objectivity are seen by Hegel as desires or drives by which absolute spirit seeks to know itself by encountering itself as an other.63 Thus, the duality between the two domains is non-substantive; it is sublated in the absolute knowledge that both are partial yet fundamentally 58 In 1762 Lambert used the term phaenomenologia to describe a ‘transcendental optics’ (optica transcendentalis); in his 1764 Neues Organon oder Gedankenüber die Erforschung und Bezeichung des Wahren und dessen Unterscheidung vom Irrthum und Schein (Leipzig, 1764), vol. 2, Part iv, he uses the term to distinguish between truth (Wahrheit) and appear-ance (Schein); ‘A quite special, though purely negative science’, writes Kant to Lambert (September 2, 1770), ‘general phenomenology (phaenomenologiageneralis), seems to be presupposed by metaphysics’.59 Bokhove, Phanomenologie: Ursprung und Entwicklung des Terminus im 18.

Un-like the eidos of Greek philosophy, Hegel’s Idee is neither transcendent (per Plato) nor immanent (per Aristotle); rather, it is the universal whole that con-tains the particulars within it and in which each particular appearance or part expresses something of the potential of the holarchical structure of the abso-lute that contains it. Although it may be argued that this conception is akin to the Platonic cosmos as presented in the Timaeus (where the ‘circle of the same’ [the universal] contains the ‘circle of difference’ [the particular]), the point to bear in mind is that Hegel’s idealism is misunderstood if it is seen as an abstraction. Rather, Hegel’s absolute is explicitly configured as a ‘con-crete universal’ (konkretes Allgemeine).64 This idea of reality as both universal and concrete is crucial to understanding the work of de Lubicz, who conceives the alchemical salt (and the philosophers’ stone) in a closely similar fashion. Hegel, therefore, provides an important piece of conceptual apparatus for the study of Lubiczian alchemy. It is thus to the holarchical idea in de Lubicz’s thought that we now turn. Spiritual ConcretionSchwaller describes the formless origin as a sphere and posits that from this sphere all known forms are derived as geometric ‘tessellations’ of what lies beyond form. The coagulating principle, responsible for the movement from formlessness (sphere) to form (geometric solids), was thus equivalent to the transition from irrational to rational forms, i.e., from the unknown and incom-prehensible to that which is known and able to be grasped:The metaphysical theme is thus: a contracting, styptic force coagulat-ing an undifferentiated milieu into a form that can only be a ‘formless’ sphere containing all forms. In other words, the regular solids (volumes) result from the sphere and end in the octahedron and not the other way around, as logic might suggest. The passage is from the curved surface to a surface composed of equilateral triangles, and from these, which are the elements of the hexagonal planar area, to the pentagons forming the surfaces of volume. There is a contraction toward rational elements from an irrational given that cannot be separated into isolated elements.6564 Magee, Hegel Dictionary, 61.65 Schwaller de Lubicz, Temple, vol. 2, 327; Lawlor, 950: ‘Le thème métaphysique est donc: une force contractant, styptique, coagulant un milieu indifférent en une forme qui ne peut être que la sphère « informe », contenant toutes les formes. Autrement dit: les volumes réguliers résultent de la sphère pour se terminer en l’octaèdre, et non en sens"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"319The Juncture of Transcendence and Concretion<UN>In this framework, the sphere and octahedron describe the extremes of a movement which passes through five geometrically ‘nested’ or interlocked forms—the Platonic solids—: the icosahedron (twenty triangular faces), the dodecahedron (twelve pentagonal faces), the cube (six square faces), the tet-rahedron (four triangular faces), and finally the octahedron (eight triangular faces). Here, each form interlocks exactly with its ‘lower’ evolute according to the numerical relationships defined by the vertices, faces, and edges of each form.66 The final octahedral form, it should be noted, contains the icosahe-dron, and thus implies a culmination that, like the octave, replicates the first form ( just as a seed results in fruit containing another seed).67 Schwaller is explicit: all the Platonic solids—and by extension all geometric volumes—are analyses, abstractions or partial representations of the pre-existing whole rep-resented by the sphere. All geometric solids can therefore only approximate the sphere, are only ‘kataphatic’ attempts to grasp the ‘apophatic’ nature of the whole. The same principle underpins Schwaller’s theory of number, in which all the numbers derive from the primordial one: first by polarisation (scission), then by inter-reaction of the poles (forming the trinity), which then creates and embodies itself in solid form (the four elements). The first four numbers thus form the Pythagorean Tetraktys.Underpinning this process, remarks Schwaller, is a function (divine activity, neter, number): ‘this function is a contraction by a centre—presumably acting equally in all directions—on a ‘spatial’ substance’.68 This is the point or centre of the sphere, which recapitulates its origin in the same way the icosahedron recapitulates itself within the octahedron:This fact exists, geometry can demonstrate it, but cerebral intelligence cannot grasp it. In principle, it is a question of the gravitational phenom-enon conditioned by an energetic ‘density’, but of a nonpolarised Ener-gy and not a kinetic energy. This is the obstacle to the definition of the inverse tel que la logique l’impose. On passe de la surface courbe à une surface composée de triangles équilatéraux, et de ceux-ci, qui sont les éléments de la surface hexagonal plane, aux pentagones formant surfaces de volume. Il y a contraction vers des éléments rationnels d’une donnée irrationnelle non séparable en éléments isolés’.66 The phenomenon of dualing Platonic solids was first demonstrated in Kepler’s Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596); they are conventionally designated according to the Schläfli symbols.67 For illustrations and discussion of the interlocking Platonic solids, see Lawlor, Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice, 96–103.68 Temple, vol. 2, 327; Lawlor, 952: ‘cette fonction est une contraction par un centre—supposé agissant également en toutes les directions—sur une « substance Espace »’."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Cheak320<UN>gravitational force starting from the circuit-formula, E=Mc2, because first it is necessary that Energy becomes Mass.69Nonpolarised energy becoming mass is the mystery of spiritual concretion. The coagulating or concretising force is described by Schwaller as ‘styptic’ (styptique), from Greek στυπτικoς (styptikos) meaning ‘astringent, contracting’ (στυφειν, styphein, ‘to contract’; στυψις, stypsis, ‘contracting effect, astringency’); in chemistry the term indicates an astringent (such as alum, the soluble salts of lead or iron, and so forth), which strongly contracts the mucous membranes, blood vessels, or tissues.70 Interestingly, alums and salts have a history in alche-my going right back to pseudo-Democritos, where alum (στυπτηρία, styptēria) and salt (ἅλας, halas) are used together in an operation for making ‘rust of gold’ (ἰὸν χρυσoυ, ion chrysou).71 More prominently, they figure in the Arabic Book of Alums and Salts, where the saline and the styptic forces are again placed side by side.72 It is thus no surprise to find a fundamental kinship between the two functions in Schwaller’s idea of salt as a contracting centre of gravity. Among the more immediate precedents for this idea is Leibniz’s (1646–1716) understanding of the visible cosmos as coagulum spiritus (‘coagulation of spir-it’); interestingly for the historiography of alchemy, Leibniz’s conception itself was informed by his studies of Chinese theories, especially the Neoconfucian thought of Zhang Zai (1020–1077) in which qi (= Greek pneuma, Latin spiritus, Sanskrit prana, Hebrew ruah, etc.) plays the role of energetic substrate that condenses itself into material form;73 Leibniz was also influenced by Lurianic kabbalah, and in this connection it is the concept of tzim-tzum—the divine 69 Temple, vol. 2, 327; Lawlor, 952: ‘Ce fait existe, la géométrie peut le démontrer mais l’intelligence cérébrale ne peut pas l’appréhender.

With these images, spirit is understood as contracting itself into a nucleus, which then forms the basis or root of growth (i.e., radix, seed, semence).75 Here the process of spirit becoming matter (mineral) and mineral becoming vegeta-tive is articulated. The physical nucleus is both the end result of contraction and the beginning of expansion; it is thus the fulcrum of spiritual densification and the seed of vegetative power (growth).What Schwaller describes as a ‘mysticism of volume’ (mystique du volume) is thus provided as a basis for understanding the salt or nucleus as an end-point in relation to mineralogenesis and a beginning-point in relation to biogenesis. Just as mineral contraction hides latent vegetal growth, so too does the nucleus contain a hidden ferment—and this is why the fixed salt can be described as possessing a sulphuric function.76 With the principle of the saline ferment, one finds that the contracting power fixed in the nucleus becomes the foundation for an expansive power: biological life becomes the externalising expression of 74 Alison Coudert, Leibniz and the Kabbalah (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1995), 95–96.75 Temple, vol. 1, 177; Lawlor, 106: ‘Le noyau de l’extrême contraction φ est octaédrique. Il est « Huit », résumant toutes les possibilités numériques, il est le cœur solide cosmique, il résulte de l’impulsion φ, mais la fonction cinq n’apparaîtra que plus tard’. (The nucleus of the extreme contraction φ is octahedral. It is “Eight” summarising all numeric possibili-ties, it is the solid, cosmic heart and it results from the impulsion φ [= harmonic scission] but the function of five will appear only later). Schwaller also indicates that the pentago-nal nature of the biological kingdom is latent in the octahedral nature of the mineral: Temple, i, 177; Lawlor, 107: ‘Le Nombre fait la parenté entre la sphère chaotique de principe et le noyau octaédrique corporel (origine minérale). La fonction φ dans le règne minéral, n’existe que dans son action végétative ou croissante (la minière), et ne deviendra appar-ente que dans le règne de la végétation visible (les plantes)’. (Number creates the lineage or kinship (parenté) between the principial chaotic sphere and the corporeal octahedral nucleus (mineral origin). The function φ in the mineral kingdom exists only in its vegeta-tive or growing action (the mine), and only becomes apparent in the kingdom of visible vegetation (plants)).76 Like Ka-Mut-Tef, the son incarnates the father and becomes the ‘bull of his mother’, and here the mother indicates the unformed spiritual substance (mercurial prima materia) that is coagulated by the divine sulphuric function to produce the first manifestation of spirit as mineral matter (materia prima). In so far as this is a concrete product resulting from metaphysical force acting upon proto-physical substance, this is also describable, in Schwaller’s parlance, as salt."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Cheak322<UN>a power latent in mineral life. Vegetative and animate life thus form the mo-dalities by which spirit liberates itself from its mineral densification. Evolution is defined accordingly by Schwaller as ‘the formal organisation (extension) of functional consciousness until the possibilities immanent in the concretising impulse are exhausted’.77Everything for Schwaller is thus in a process of gestation towards the whole from which it was created (condensed), and his philosophy is important for its imperative to perceive reality as a living process rather than as an arrested product. To see everything as gestating is to see it as still participating in both a formative force (seed) and a nourishing milieu (matrix), both of which are vital to its existence. This idea was central not only to his laboratory alchemy, which was based upon archaic conceptions of metallic seeds developing in mineral wombs, but also his view of the movement of existence as a whole, which was situated within grand astronomical cycles in which the phenom-enon of equinoctial precession provides a slowly shifting universal milieu, a ‘cosmic ambiance’ that colours the nature of all things that develop within its ‘womb’.And yet, the ‘product’ or ‘fruit’ of this gestation was for Schwaller not a teleo-logical finality but, to use the words of Jean Gebser, an ‘ever-present origin’.78 Just as the extremes of Goethe’s dark spectrum are resolved into a colour be-yond the spectrum (red and violet form magenta—from which they may also be seen to depart), so too do the phenomena ‘seed’ and ‘fruit’ form a unity that, like the phenomena of tone and octave, embodies both origin and culmina-tion. For this reason, the concept of the stone in Lubiczian alchemy appears to lie at the root of the series that, to ordinary perception, is usually only con-ceivable as its final product. From this perspective, ‘evolution’ as a movement 77 Verbe Nature, ‘Conclusions’ (Aor, 190): ‘L’évolution est l’organisation (extension) for-male de la conscience fonctionnelle, jusqu’à épuisement des Possibilités immanentes à l’impulsion concrétisant’.78 Jean Gebser, The Ever-Present Origin, xxvii: ‘Origin is ever-present. It is not a beginning, since all beginning is linked with time. And the present is not just the ‘now’, today, the moment or a unit of time. It is ever-originating, an achievement of full integration and continuous renewal.

Material forms are thus so many articulations of an ever-present process of ‘spiritual concretion’ in which the integral whole precedes, forms and completes the manifest parts. This is why, for Schwaller, the ‘stone does not evolve’79 and why, paradoxically, the alchemical ars transmutationis can also be consistent with a Parmenidean metaphysics of unmovingness. Like the Archimedean screw, whose helical thread ‘evolves’ yet stays the same, Schwaller’s concept of the stone embod-ies the paradox of ‘progressing while somehow remaining the same’. Thus, the ontology at the core of Lubiczian symbolique leads one to a coincidence of ‘simultaneous being and becoming’.803 Alchemy as Nondual ProcessThe esotericism of de Lubicz speaks directly to the perception of alchemy as a nondual, operative-spiritual process. Lubiczian alchemy is not a dualistic spiritual alchemy that dismisses the physical or physiological aspects of the alchemical tradition as somehow inferior or irrelevant to the purely spiritual aspects of the alchemical purview. In other words, it is not an alchemy that can be subsumed under the dualistic spiritual interpretation of Atwood (an exclu-sively spiritual alchemy in which the operative element would be dismissed entirely);81 nor is it compatible with the psychological interpretation of Sil-berer and Jung, which views the material aspect of alchemy as merely a ‘screen’ for the projection of the soul’s archetypal dramaturgy.8279 Al-Kemi, 59: ‘There is an essential aspect that cannot be transmitted. It turns out to be the most obvious, the most common, so generally accepted that it becomes invisible. It is ever present and constantly visible, all texts insist on that point. Go ahead, ask me: What is ... it? I will sound foolish telling you that it is the stone, but if you knew stone, stoneness, its tremendous concentration, and its passivity, you would know that this is the material of the lode, the matrix of the mineral. It’s the starting point, yes, you start with the stone to find the stone, where else? Prima materia and materia prima are not the same; one is a beginning and the other is an end. But it is always the same stone, the stone does not evolve’.80 Al-Kemi, 191.81 Atwood, A Suggestive Enquiry into the Hermetic Mystery (Belfast: William Tait, 1918).82 Jung, Psychologie und Alchemie (Zurich, 1944); Mysterium coniunctionis: Untersuchun-gen über die Trennung und Zusammensetzung der seelischen Gegensatze in der alchemie (Zurich, 1955); ‘Studien über alchemistische Vorstellungen’, C.G.

Principe;83 nor is he an exclusively operative alchemist. His alchemy cannot be explained by simply translating his symbolique into the formulas of modern chemistry. Rather, Schwaller presents himself as someone deeply immersed in the same simultaneously empirical and soteriological en-deavour as that of the early modern Naturphilosophen, who were in fact his literary initiators.84 Generally speaking, Schwaller is much more comparable to a figure like Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925), who took his method from Goethean phenomenology, rather than a figure like Carl Jung (1875–1961), who took his method from Freudian psychology.85 And while it is not necessary to perpetu-ate the polemics of Principe against Jung, who must be accorded his proper place, it must be emphasised that Lubiczian alchemy, while distinctly modern, is of a completely different character to that of his Germanic and Anglophone contemporaries. De Lubicz himself studied deeply the works of early modern chymists and attempted to reproduce their results. While Jung was still alive, Schwaller remarked: ‘no one has been further from an understanding of Greek and medieval alchemy than Jung and the psychoanalytic school. Alchemy 83 Principe has suggested that the work of Jung is merely an extension of the ‘deleterious outgrowth’ of Victorian occultism; Principe, ‘Alchemy i: Introduction’, in Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism, 14.84 Of the French Theosophical Society, Schwaller remarked: ‘I was infinitely grateful to this movement for having opened my eyes to certain aspects of Buddhism, but later I had to follow my proper path’; (letter from Rene Schwaller to unknown recipient, reproduced in Geneviève Dubois, Fulcanelli dévoilé, 137); in this sense he has been compared to Rudolf Steiner, who similarly began his occult career in Theosophy before departing on his own spiritual course. ‘Steiner’, comments Dufour-Kowalski, ‘by knowing how to liberate him-self from the theosophical grasp in order to follow his proper path, would therefore have a determining influence upon the future choices of René Schwaller’; L’Œuvre au rouge, 22 n. 2: ‘Ainsi, Steiner, pour avoir su se libérer de l’emprise théosophique et suivre sa propre voie, influera de manière déterminante sur les choix à venir de Réne Schwaller’.85 This is not to suggest that Jungian psychology is identical with Freudian psychology, mere-ly that they grew out of the same basic approach (exploration of the unconscious as a key to understanding human nature). Regarding the Jungian interpretation of alchemy, a more nuanced statement of the Jungian position is given in his Alchemical Studies, 349: ‘Alchemy lost its vital substance when some of the alchemists abandoned the Labora-torium for the Oratorium, there to befuddle themselves with an ever more nebulous mysticism, while others converted the Oratorium into a Laboratorium and discovered chemistry. We feel sorry for the former and admire the latter, but no one asks about the fate of the psyche, which thereafter vanished from sight for several hundred years’."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"325The Juncture of Transcendence and Concretion<UN>depends on laboratory results. It is a manipulation of matter which has always been known. It occurs everywhere in nature, all the time’.86 In this respect, one may regard the recent scholarly critiques of Jung on these points as merely a late academic realisation of points that were plainly evident to practising twentieth-century alchemists at least forty years previously. For these reasons, the work of de Lubicz presents itself as especially pertinent to the understand-ing not only of modern conceptions of alchemy, but also of its deeper currents of continuity.Schwaller’s alchemy grows from the milieu of Parisian alchemists surround-ing Fulcanelli, who were deeply immersed in the practical, laboratory aspects of the work, but who were ultimately seeking the verification not of material but metaphysical processes.87 The Parisian alchemists of the fin-de-siècle and the early twentieth century looked not to Atwood (et al.), but to the texts of Ba-sil Valentine, Nicolas Flamel, and Cyliani (among many others) as exemplars of the alchemical tradition. For Schwaller, these seemingly bewildering texts not only masked a distinct laboratory process (a fact that has been increasingly recognised by recent scholars of early modern alchemists such as Isaac New-ton and Eirenaeus Philalethes),88 but ran deeper still: behind the operative 86 Al-Kemi, 48.87 This alchemical milieu and the influence it has had on a distinctly operative yet spiri-tual alchemy—and continues to have on contemporary alchemy and parachemistry into the twenty-first century (especially via figures such as Eugène Canseliet, Jean Dubois, Al-bert Riedel/Frater Albertus, and their many students)—makes the figure of Schwaller de Lubicz a significant key to understanding the persistence of the phenomenon of alchemy in a supposed age of science.88 Principe and Newman, in several publications, have taken up the task of ‘rehabilitating al-chemy’ from the prevailing views in which it has been erroneously situated, i.e., especially as mere proto-chemistry or somehow false chemistry. They have argued persuasively for alchemy to be recognised as dealing less with mystical speculation and more with very real, empirically reproducible practices that can be described in modern chemical terms. To this end, Newman himself has actually reproduced some of these practices in a mod-ern laboratory setting and therefore shown that alchemical procedures can indeed be translated into the language of modern science. In particular, Newman and his assistants have demonstrated that many of Newton’s encoded alchemical procedures can be deci-phered, replicated, and described in modern chemical parlance: e.g. the arbor Dianae or ‘tree of Diana’ refers to a metallic dendrite of silver and mercury; the ‘net’: a purple alloy of copper and antimony taking on a net-like appearance; and the ‘star regulus of antimo-ny’, a crystalline form of metallic antimony.

It was precisely this effort to think according to a deeper symbolic imperative that gave Schwaller the clavis hermeneutica to the architectonic texts of cathedral and temple, and thus to the mentalité that, at least for Schwaller, underpinned the entire Hermetic tradition. While scholars see the idea of a monolithic esoteric, Hermetic, or alchemical ‘tradi-tion’ as historically problematic, merely an identity construct, Schwaller saw the breakthrough to the perception of an actual ontological reality that eludes a purely quantitative epistemology as the true test of a Hermetic adept. For Schwaller, the perception of this reality, at once abstract and concrete, the very bedrock of existence, at once material and spiritual, did not need a histori-cal transmission because it was ever-present, therefore perennially available to human perception. At the same time, however, it was also ever-absent—or occulted—per the Heraclitian dictum: ‘nature loves to hide herself ’.89 To ‘dis-cover’ this ontological bedrock thus required an effort to ‘break though’, and for Schwaller this was equivalent to ‘finding’ the stone, which was seen more as the process underpinning and embodied in materiality per se—the mineral kingdom being regarded as the first material manifestation of spirit—than as a peculiar piece of isolatable matter. For Schwaller it was this fundamental mode of reality-apperception, rather than rigid points of technical or doctrinal ex-egesis, that formed the true hidden current of continuity within the Hermetic tradition, indelibly marking all ‘good’ texts and adepts. But it also had a mate-rial application or proof, and this formed the experimentum crucis (and here it should be noted that the term experimentum, in Latin as in French, means both experiment and experience). Alchemy for Schwaller thus centred on a metaphysics of perception but also a material proof that this perception was germane to the very structure of matter and existence as we known it.All of this underscores the fact that too rigid an insistence on alchemy as an overtly or exclusively physico-chemical process cannot be sustained nor extended beyond its proper contexts any more than can an exclusively psycho-spiritual alchemy; this is especially evident once one steps outside the rela-tively narrow period of early modern and modern Western Europe, whereupon the picture changes drastically.

David Gordon White’s magisterial study of rasayana siddha traditions in Medieval India, for instance, lays bare a blatantly alchemical world in which the transmutation of the mortal human body into an immortal divine body was explicitly homologised with metallurgical trans-mutations according to the formula: ‘as in metals, so in the body’.90 Here, the whole elixir tradition takes centre stage, the origins of which take us back to the deeply Taoist alchemy of ancient China, which, per the work of Needham and Sivin, shows no contradiction at all between the inner (nei dan) and outer (wai dan) elixirs.91 The case becomes even more explicit in the Tibetan Bud-dhist alchemy of the Kalacakra Tantra, in which metallurgical, medicinal, and metaphysical aims are thoroughly intertwined; here, metallurgical and botani-cal processes are used in the creation of iatrochemical elixirs designed to pro-long life not for its own sake, but in order to ‘buy time’ to achieve liberation in life (jivanmukti) through the actualisation of the initiate’s Buddha Nature.92 Elsewhere, the work of Corbin on Jaldakī shows the deep insistence that was placed in Arabic tradition on alchemy as an ars hieratica and the distinct re-lationship that was seen to exist between the metallurgical process and the creation of a resurrection body.93The deep relationship that is seen here between metallurgical and mystical processes all pertain strongly to de Lubicz’s perception of salt as the metaphys-ical foundation of and hidden continuity between all bodies, from ‘mineral to man’.

A study of the alchemy of de Lubicz not only allows this broader premise to be explored in a limited context, it also allows one to gain a deeper insight into some of the broader, nondual currents of alchemical precept and practice.In the final analysis, Schwaller’s concept of symbolique entails a metaphys-ics of perception in which not only the phenomenal cosmos as a whole, but also the parts and processes that unfold within it, are able to be grasped non-dually as living symbols—indeed alchemical marriages—of transcendence and concretion. From the evolutionary journey of consciousness through the kingdoms of nature, down to specific laboratory procedures, Schwaller’s Hermetic symbolique pivots on the mystery of spiritual concretion. All vis-ible phenomena express a precise geometric philosophy, and in accordance with this Pythagorean imperative, de Lubicz’s theory of symbolique is not simply concerned with questions of an epistemological character; it is ulti-mately rooted in realities of an ontological, soteriological, and cosmogonic order.BibliographyAtwood, Mary Anne, A Suggestive Enquiry into the Hermetic Mystery, Belfast: William Tait 1918.Bell, Lanny, ‘Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal Ka’, Journal of Near Eastern Studies 44, no. 4 (1985): 251–294.Bell, Lanny, ‘The New Kingdom “Divine” Temple: The Example of Luxor’, in: Byron E.

It can be employed with equal ease as a purely formal sign (as in mathematics) or to indicate a deeper sense of meaning with a multiplicity of contents (even carrying apparent con-tradictions within itself ). For some, the Symbol is understood as the key par excellence to unlocking the spiritual world. For religious people the Symbol may be far superior to words in its ability to shed light on the nature of divinity.The Italian philosopher and esotericist Julius Evola (1898–1974) also assigns a more specific transcendent quality to the symbol.2 For him the symbol has never been, nor is it ever, a mere product of fantasy appearing out of thin air; nor is it chosen in a completely arbitrary manner. Quite to the contrary: the basis of a “genuine”, i.e., sacred, symbol was, in his view, concerned more with the authentic perception of the interior or superior aspect of cosmic forces. For him these “superior” forces were captured long before their objectification on the material plane, by “superior” spiritual faculties. According to Evola, one is essentially dealing here with the genuine “vision” of something that origi-nates in the transcendent order of being, but which is then projected onto the level of our earthly, sensory world; because of this, the symbol can sometimes assume fantastical forms.Here some clarifications are in order regarding the so-called Traditional worldview of Evola. On one hand, the idea of Tradition, which was founda-tional for Evola, rests upon that of René Guénon (1886–1951). Although Evola and Guénon’s concepts of Tradition are not completely equivalent, neither should be identified with what is ordinarily understood under the rubric of tradition (i.e., slavish preservation of what is handed down from the past).3 Rather, this so-called integral Tradition sees itself as a completely universal, 1 Translated from the German by Aaron Cheak.2 Evola, Simboli della Tradizione Occidentale, 17, 18.3 Hakl, ‘Frontal gegen die Moderne—Die integrale Tradition’."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"335The Symbology Of Hermeticism In The Work Of Julius Evola <UN>thoroughly metaphysical spiritual attitude whose origin is in the transcenden-tal, in the absolute, i.e., “divine” ground of being and lies beyond humanity, country and history. Tradition therefore belongs to the Platonic world of ideas. According to their own understanding, Tradition is originary (primordial), sin-gular and all-encompassing. All metaphysical worldviews and religions spring from and refer to it. And yet, like the broken pieces of a dull and tarnished mir-ror, each part will only reflect single aspects of the original wholeness, for they are but fragments of the supersensory unity. It is nevertheless still possible to reconstruct this primordial tradition today and to speak, with Frithjof Schuon (1907–1998), of the ‘transcendent unity of all religions’, concentrating on the universal spirituality, leaving aside the geographic, historical and human con-tingencies. This naturally demands a corresponding spiritual guidance as well as sensitivity. Traditional symbolism provides one means of access to this.The integral Tradition in this sense is thus no fabrication of humanity; it has been, so to speak, granted to us from “above”, from the “divine”. We can only attempt to apprehend it as “purely” as possible and then transmit it to further generations. Since Tradition lays claim to a “divine” descent originating from the ground of being, it cannot be called into question; it never changes and it forms the absolute standard that everything must necessarily follow. It stands beyond everything human and temporal and in this sense it is eternal. The modern world in general, and the technological civilization of the modern West in particular, rests upon purely material, physico-chemical foundations and is considered to be the exact opposite of this Tradition. Evola even speaks of two ‘opposed, apriori categories of civilization’, which have nothing what-soever in common and which are both essentially and qualitatively divided.4 The first category is the world of being, the transcendent realm of ideas in the Platonic sense, while the other is the earthly realm of becoming, the world of life and death. The metaphysical and physical thus stand completely opposed to each other.The integral Tradition, which is never completely realizable here on earth (for it can only form an ideal to be strived for) rests upon uncompromising-ly hierarchical thinking (and here the word ‘hierarchy’ must be taken in its original sense: Greek hieros, ‘holy, sacred’ + archē, ‘rule, principle’). Here the highest level of the hierarchy approaches the transcendent, while the levels below it become increasingly material. The modern world, by contrast, is ruled by egalitarian thinking. From Tradition’s premise of absolute metaphysical precedence, there necessarily follows a series of irreconcilable oppositions to modernity.4 Evola, Revolt Against the Modern World, xxxi–xxxii. (Rivolta contro il mondo moderno, 7)."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Hakl336<UN>In Evola’s Traditionalist worldview, an absolute antithesis thus exists be-tween the “mythical” world of the “ancients” (which thoroughly permeates alchemy) in which the vision of a metaphysical realm is self-evident, and the worldview of contemporary humanity, who predominantly think in words, and for whom visions and transcendent “images” are completely foreign. The “Traditional” individual is comparable to the archaic humanity described by Mircea Eliade (1907–1986), a humanity that lived in the illud tempus, a time that knew no historical or chronological sequence as such, but which sought to evoke, through rite and ritual, the mythical experience of the primordial origin. For it was here, through the agency of a divinity, hero or ancestor, that creation took place—whether of individuals, of a people, or of a city.5 In ritual time there is consequently always a transcendence of the temporal in which a relationship to the metaphysical can be established. The sacred, and the con-nection to the transcendent “cosmos”, is thereby rendered ever-present, and the traditional individual remains completely embedded through this connec-tion. For Evola, “true” myths and symbols ultimately stem from this primordial, mythic time; they were bequeathed to humanity by “gods” and “spirits”, i.e., “forces of nature” when the human spirit was still malleable, and they have retained this character ever since.6 The symbol therefore becomes a genu-ine gate to the higher world. It makes immediate contact possible. And what emerges from this contact is a form of esoteric knowledge that is therefore above or outside rationality.Evola himself writes: ‘In esoteric knowledge, the symbol holds the exact position that the concept has in rational and logical knowledge. The funda-mentally technical justification for the use of symbols [...] can be formulated as follows: to exercise the spirit, to understand by seeing or perceiving rather than thinking7—that is, to understand by surpassing the mediating instrument [...] of the brain, i.e., to abandon the rational and discursive formulation that the modern “educated” man is so deeply accustomed to’.8 This form of know-ing lends itself eminently to a comparison with the “understanding” of music. Moreover, this a-rationality is the reason why we modern humans so often find symbols “bewildering”.5 Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Return (Kosmos und Geschichte, passim, esp. 33; first edition, 1969).6 Evola, La tradizione ermetica nei suoi simboli, 28 (The Hermetic Tradition, 15).7 That is, in a vision that goes beyond thought.8 Anonymus (but Julius Evola) ‘Sull’arte dei filosofi d’Ermete’ (On the Art of Hermetic Philoso-phy), ur 1928, 172."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"337The Symbology Of Hermeticism In The Work Of Julius Evola <UN>In the text just cited, Evola adduces a remark by the Swiss occultist and free-mason Oswald Wirth (1860–1943), who speaks of symbols as the ‘schools of silence’, where ‘the student is not indoctrinated’, rather, ‘he is exposed to the presence of himself, and to mute visions. In such a case it can happen however that the images and signs say nothing to him’.9 In this case the “schools of the wise” would only waste his time and the student would have to turn to the common pedagogues, who would tell him exactly what to think.Evola continues his explanation: ‘The symbol offers rational understanding no access’. And no one, he affirms, is farther from true insight into a symbol than the one who pores over its meaning with an attitude of ‘philosophical hairsplitting’. Other faculties must step into action here, ‘faculties which, to a certain degree, possess an understanding that is simultaneously a vision and a realization’.10 By means of this “vision”, not only would abstract “knowledge” (cognition) emerge, one would also become united with the object of knowl-edge, which thus becomes an essential part of one’s own consciousness and one’s own reality. In this way it also becomes, to a certain degree, “available”.Like Wirth, Evola further underscores how the symbol (in contrast to ratio-nal argumentation, which seeks to compel, convince and persuade) does not impose itself. It leaves the individual his independence. Only through an act of inner silence will esoteric knowledge open itself to the seeker. According to Evola, the symbolism with which “esoteric” wisdom has always been clothed preserves thereby a timeless core, while simultaneously guaranteeing freedom to the questing individual.In the first volume of the writings of the Ur Group, the symbol is granted its own chapter on the basis of its importance to the magical path (i.e., magi-cal in Evola’s sense).11 The chapter does not stem from Evola, but from Arturo Reghini (1878–1946),12 who, next to Guénon, was his most significant mentor.13 He was also a co-founder of the Ur Group. Because Evola chose and regulated the contents of the individual contributions to the Ur magazine, one can say without any doubt that Evola was in complete agreement with him.Reghini, who wrote in Ur under the pseudonym Pietro Negri, interprets the word “Symbol” first and foremost in its etymological sense. In ancient Greek, 9 Wirth, Le Symbolisme Hermétique, 2.10 Anonymus (but Julius Evola) ‘Sull’arte dei filosofi d’Ermete’, 172.11 Negri, ‘Knowledge of the Symbol’.12 See Hakl, ‘Julius Evola and the Ur Group’.13 Evola thanks Reghini expressly for his introduction to alchemy in his spiritual autobiog-raphy, Il cammino del cinabro, 107 (The Path of Cinnabar, 2009), where he passes in review the origins and motivations of his most significant works."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Hakl338<UN>the word sym-ballo has the meaning ‘I join, bring together, throw together’ and stands in opposition to dia-ballo, ‘I separate, divide, throw apart’. Here sym-bolon becomes the opposite of dia-bolos, the devil. And with Dante Alighieri, Reghini distinguishes between the literal, allegorical, moral and finally ana-gogic sense of symbols.14 The anagogic sense (from Greek anagōgē, ‘that which raises, ascends, leads up’) is considered the highest and most complete sense in symbolism because it points to the symbol’s ‘transcendent content’. Ana-gogically understood and applied, symbols contribute to spiritual elevation and in this sense they are also endowed with a power that leads people to tran-scendence. This “magical” use of symbols as gates to the supernal world is not only a characteristic of Hermeticism in general, Reghini stresses, it is also ever-present in the rituals of those orders that bear a Hermetic influence.2 Premises of the Traditional Meaning of Symbols in AlchemyEvola’s central work on the symbology of alchemy is his book, La tradizione ermetica nei suoi simboli, nella sia dottrina e nella sua “Arte Regia” (The Her-metic Tradition: Its Symbols, its Doctrines, and its “Royal Art”).15 Already in the foreword, the Roman author stresses that Hermeticism, in his sense, is closely bound to the alchemical Tradition and should not be restricted solely to the Corpus Hermeticum. It would involve a “secret”16 wisdom tradition, which at the same time corresponds to a praxis oriented towards the dimension of Tran-scendence. In his eyes this wisdom tradition has preserved a great uniformity of doctrine and praxis from the Greeks through the Arabs right down to the threshold of the present era. Despite an incredible variety of symbols, the ‘sons of Hermes’ would all ‘say the same thing’.17 This had already been testified to 14 Dante Alighieri, Il convivio, ii, 1 (numerous editions).15 Reference will be made to (1) the original Italian edition (La tradizione ermetica, 1931) [henceforth lte 1931]; (2) to the fourth, corrected edition (La tradizione ermetica, 1996 [henceforth lte 1996]), and (3) to the English translation by E.E. Rehmus (The Hermetic Tradition, 1995 [henceforth, tht 1995]).16 Cf. the extremely blunt words of the alchemist Artephius in the Livre de Artephius in Bib-liothèque des Philosophes Chimiques (1741), vol. ii, 144: ‘Poor fool! How can you be so naïve as to believe that we would teach you openly and clearly the greatest and most important of our secrets? I assure you that whoever tries to explain in the ordinary and literal sense of the words what the [hermetic] philosophers have written will find himself caught in the meanderings of a labyrinth from which he can never escape, because he lacks Ari-adne’s thread as a guide’, cited by Evola, lte 1931, 5 (lte 1996, 23; tht 1995, xv, n. 1).17 Evola, lte 1931, 6 (tht, xvi)."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"339The Symbology Of Hermeticism In The Work Of Julius Evola <UN>by the Arabic (possibly Persian) alchemist, Geber ( Jabir ibn Hayyan, 721–815), who affirms: ‘Verily there exists a consensus among the authors, even if to the uninitiated there appears to be disagreement’.18 As further proof, Evola ad-duces Dom Pernety (1716–1796), who writes: ‘The Hermetic philosophers are all unified as opposed [to the common philosophers]. Not one contradicts the principles of the others. One who wrote thirty years ago speaks as one who lived two thousand years ago’. To this Pernety adds the ecclesiastical maxim: Quod ubique, quod ab omnibus & quod semper creditum est (what has always been believed, everywhere and by everyone), a sentence which Evola also ad-opted as an axiom for his integral Tradition.19The doctrine that accompanied this motto was explained by Evola in the words of Jakob Böhme (1575–1624): ‘Reason that understands nothing of the eternal birth is thus blind. [...] If reason could understand this, the whole pro-cess would be revealed to it: between the eternal birth, the process of restora-tion after the fall, and the process of the wise with their philosophers’ stone, there is no point of difference, because it is all resurrected in the eternal birth and all must have a restoration in the same fashion’.20 For Böhme, birth in the eternal, reinstatement in the primordial condition of divinity after the great “fall” (i.e., reintegration in the sense of Martinez de Pasqually as well as Evola), and the process of the stone of the wise are one and the same procedure of spiritual perfection. This is exactly what Evola means when he links the al-chemical process with the Hermetic Tradition, and also with “high” magic (in Evola’s sense). The goal is always to transform the un-liberated, earthly human into a god (deificatio) (not merely a similitude of god) and to make this person immortal. For this reason, Evola represents alchemy not as a specialty field, ‘which preoccupies itself with the metals and their correspondences in man, but as a complete, all-encompassing, physical and metaphysical system’.21The goal of this system is to enable the ascertainment and experience of an animated, ‘sacred organism, replete with living powers, in which everything is marvelously interwoven and intercommunicating. Man stands in the middle as microcosm, containing by analogy the complete macrocosm—as above, so 18 Geber, Livre du Mercure Oriental (text in Berthelot, La Chimie au Moyen Age, 1893) cited in Evola, lte, 6 (tht, xvi n. 2).

Hence the symbolic language of alchemy, as an expression of this universal system, must also have correspon-dences in other mysteriosophic realms and can therefore serve as a universal key to these realms. The reverse is also true: knowledge gleaned from foreign mystery traditions is able to fill in the lacunae of the alchemical tradition’.22 Already in 1926, Evola published an article in the magazine Ultra23 (put out by the liberal Lega teosophica [Theosophical Lodge] in Rome under Decio Cal-vari), in which the similarities of alchemical symbology were compared with those of the mysteries of Mithras (e.g., the significance of the stone).It is precisely this representation of the alchemical tradition as a universal system that met stiff opposition from René Guénon, who understood it as a mere cosmological system.24 Guénon did not recognize alchemy as a complete metaphysical doctrine at all, much less one that was concerned with a ‘rein-statement in the primordial condition of divinity’.In order to comprehend alchemical symbols, certain premises must be borne in mind according to Evola. The first premise requires that one attempt to place oneself—one’s mode of experiencing—in the consciousness of the Traditional world (which, as has already been noted, runs completely counter to the modern view). To reach it by a mere intellectual shift is not enough. The Traditional human not only had ‘another way of thinking and feeling, but also another way of perceiving and knowing’. 25 To achieve this we must ‘evoke with-in us an actual transmutation of consciousness’, according to Evola. Only then will ‘the unexpected light of certain expressions dawn on us; specific symbols then become the path to an inner awakening [...] and then one understands how certain “rites” assume an active, “magical” power’.26 Significantly, here one sees that these perceptions go far beyond what is described as “intuition”; rather, they approach a “completely” lived esoteric experience that possesses a transformative character.22 Ibid., 7.23 Evola, ‘La via della realizzazione di sé secondo i misteri di Mithra’ (The Path of Realiza-tion in the Mysteries of Mithras). A compilation of his important works on the myster-ies of Mithras is contained in Evola, La via della realizzazione di sé secondo i Misteri di Mitra (2007). The text is prefaced by a highly informative analysis of the theme by Stefano Arcella.24 Review of La tradizione ermetica in Voile d’Isis, April 1931, contained in Guénon, Formes traditionnelles et cycles cosmiques, 119ff.25 lte, 1996, 44 (tht, 14); Evola places these words in italics in order to stress their importance.26 lte, 42 (tht, 14)."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"341The Symbology Of Hermeticism In The Work Of Julius Evola <UN>A further fundamental point concerns the human experience of nature. Here it is not a matter of knowledge and understanding of physical laws, but of the vital experience of nature as a living, sacred, animated body and as the ‘visible expression of the invisible’. Evola cites some more extracts from the Corpus Hermeticum in order to make this vital experience comprehensible. In addition, he emphasizes that the spiritual constitution of the traditional man was such that any sensory perception simultaneously presented in that moment a psychological component in the form of a ‘specific, powerful feel-ing’, an emotional overtone which “animated” it, and which added to the im-age a “meaningful content”, which went far beyond “poetic exuberance”. In this way, ancient physics could also be theology. Evola also refers here to the power of myth, and here he draws expressly upon Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling (1775–1854), just as he also made use time and again of modern “secular” stud-ies, e.g., on the mentalité primitive done by contemporary anthropologists such as Lucien Lévy-Bruhl or Emile Durkheim, although he interpreted them in his own “traditional” manner.27Evola also proposes a third central Hermetic principle: that of “immanence”. According to this principle, all alchemical ingredients, e.g., the metals that one usually situates in the outside world, are also present in the individual human being. Following this, they can be understood simultaneously in a cosmic, naturally oriented sense and in an interior, human sense. This can be very con-fusing for the reader of alchemical literature if the texts indicate first one and then the other. On the other hand, if the above corresponds to the below, and the inner to the outer, then this “ambiguity” is completely natural. Accordingly, lead in the interior sense is denoted by the heavy, unliberated, earthly bodies of humans while lead in the external sense refers to the heavy, unliberated (i.e., not yet perfect) metal (♄). There is effectively no “real” difference, for in both cases, according to the alchemical understanding, the power of nature is one and the same, with completely equivalent effects.Stone, water, mine, lead, gold, fire, tree, talisman, quintessence—are so many symbols to be understood on numerous levels. In order to explicate this, Evola cites the Buddhist expression that our body is only eight hand-spans high, but it contains the entire world, to include its origin and dissolution. ‘Everything that the macrocosm possesses’, affirms Olympiodorus the younger (c. 495–570), ‘so too does man possess’.2827 See the frequent references to Lévy-Bruhl in Evola’s main work, Rivolta contro il mondo moderno (1935), beginning with pages 26, 63, 74 (Revolt against the Modern World, 1995); he is already repeatedly mentioned in lte 1931, e.g., on page 29 (tht, e.g., 16 n 4).28 Text in Berthelot, Collection des anciens Alchimistes Grecs, ii, 100."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Hakl342<UN>In order to elucidate even more this principle, which is so significant for Hermeticism, I would like to furnish a sentence from one of Evola’s earliest philosophical writings: ‘What matters, therefore, is to come to the immediate awareness that one is the bearer of immaterial, cosmic forces, of which nature represents only the sensory embodiment and concretization’. 29 Thus, the work of alchemy for Evola is above all an inner transformation of the consciousness of the alchemist, which first lifts him to a “higher” (less materialistic and more transcendent) plane, from which position he ‘stands over’ and rules things.A further necessary premise is the realization that the idea of elements in Hermeticism concern “living” and spiritual realities, not the dead and “base” elements of modern science. This is why the texts call them “our” water and “our” fire, “our mercury” and not “that of the vulgar”. In this respect, Evola cites (among others) Nicolas Flamel (c. 1330–c.1418), who emphasizes that the four elements, out of which all things arise, ‘are not those that emerge visibly before the eyes; rather, they are those that become known through their effects’.30 Hermeticism only deals with the invisible, “magical” elements (which initiate an effect), and which are known only by the “wise”. According to Bernardus Trevisanus (1406–1490), “our” sulphur and “our” mercury ‘are not those that the vulgar conceive of ’, such as those that ‘the apothecaries sell’; rather, they are ‘the spirit of the philosophers’.31Similarly, according to the Hermetic Triumph (Triomphe Hermétique),32 al-chemy is to be understood and applied upon the premises of ‘interior and ex-terior knowledge concerning the properties of all things’ and ‘penetration into the depths of the work of nature’. Furthermore, ‘who cannot comprehend this by themselves will never be able to understand it through others ...’. This sci-ence, believes Evola, will only be realized through a ‘storm of the spirit’.33And Evola wants to ignite just such a “storm” with his book, or at the very least to set the required ‘transmutation of consciousness’ in motion. He does this, according to his own recommendation, by pushing rational-verbal com-munication into the background in order to speak more in images. And images 29 Evola‚ ‘Die drei Epochen des Gewißheitsproblems’, Logos (1931); now in Evola, Über das Initiatische, 167-183, citation on page 182.

Around seven hundred original citations are treated in his book—a further three hundred had to be abandoned in the first edition at the behest of his publisher.34 And in this way he approaches his topic: by simulta-neously citing a wealth of images from different Hermeticists, and thus circling closer and closer to the object of his inquiry (a process which C.G. Jung called circumambulatio).35Through this panorama of multiple perspectives, one’s awareness is able to gradually accustom itself to the at-first-unfamiliar image. In this way one can more easily grasp the “centre” in a “meditative” way, without having to concen-trate on a single path or approach; and then the realization suddenly flashes forth (which may not have been possible with a more “direct” approach). One has suddenly “encircled” the intrinsic meaning and immediately “grasped” it without verbalizing the realization (perception) and so confining it to ratio-nal channels. The realization, however, is not completely precise for it is not simply located in the “brain”; rather, it exists in a subtle way in the entire body-consciousness. And the object of exploration will not be apprehended solely by its “centre” but in a similar way by its “aura”, that is, through the multiplicity of the often unconscious associations with which it is bound. This engenders an impression that can be understood in a much deeper and far more compre-hensive manner.From mnemonics one also knows that objects impress themselves in our memory more deeply and enduringly through associations. Once one has 34 Indeed, although Evola has the intention to create a work that necessarily goes beyond rational scholarship, it nevertheless avails itself of academic standards such as verifiable sources and so forth. If this were not the case, a recognized philosopher like Benedetto Croce would never have supported the book. In a letter of 28.1.1930 to the publisher Lat-erza, Evola emphasizes the necessity of the numerous citations: ‘The book cannot be popular, and on factual grounds, there is currently nothing else like it: it explains alchemy not as superstitious chemistry but as a veil of mysterious wisdom; at the same time the book entails a daring task, for herein I attempt to present alchemy to a respectable culture for the first time’. On this, see Daniela Coli, Croce, Laterza e la cultura europea, 222f.35 C.G. Jung has described the psychotherapeutic process and the individuation process as circumambulatio: ‘The path is not linear, but apparently cyclic. More precise aware-ness has shown it as a spiral: after certain intervals, the dream motif always returns again to definite forms, which proceed around and thus describe a centre’. Jung, Gesammelte We r ke (1970–1976), vol. 12, 43/44. Jung also refers to the ‘circles of light and the protection of the middle’ in Chinese alchemy. One also thinks of the circumambulation of a temple or of a holy object, and of the rituals of circumambulation in the lodges of Freemasonry, which recall the orbit of the sun.

It is as if the impression that has passed through the “neuronal pathways” has already learned, on second contact, to function by itself. Only one’s own experience enables one to really understand what is actually meant here. Moreover, there is apparently a certain “magical attraction” inherent to this process that can actually have an “addictive” effect on the practitioner.3 Evola’s “Traditional” Method of Interpretation in PraxisAn example, largely in Evola’s own words, should clarify how he proceeds to make symbols comprehensible and how he continually utilizes images and imagistic references in order to outwit the rational mind and its habitual in-tellectual verbalizations. Evola achieves his purpose when the reader attains an understanding through the recurring employment of images that the read-er has already come to experience as “his own”, without being able to clarify the way which has led there. The success consists in evoking in the reader an echo, equally in the form of images, but which the reader lives as his “own” experience, and which nevertheless follows the pathways stimulated by the image under investigation. To serve as a general example of Evola’s method, the so-called prima materia—the starting point of any alchemical work—will be examined.36 Evola begins with the idea of ‘unity’, which he describes as the ‘first principle of the Hermetic doctrine’. The fundamental formula of unity is already present in the Chrysopoeia of Kleopatra:37 ‘one is all’ (hen to pan). This is the all-unity, which is also bound to the idea of the ‘telesma, the father of all things [...]’ in the Emerald Tablet.38Thereafter follows the detailed, circumabulatory elucidation, which is able to initiate the numerous, required associations: ‘The alchemical ideogram of the pan-unity is f, the circle, the line or movement which returns to itself and which contains both beginning and end. At the same time, this symbol in 36 lte 1931, 32f.

In this connection, Evola also describes a manuscript with a diagram formed from two circles; the outer circle of which bears the following impres-sive inscription: ‘One is all, the source of all and the culmination of all: if the all did not contain everything, it would be nothing’.Evola then continues with his encircling: ‘This “all” is also described as Chaos (“our” Chaos) and as an egg (ōon prōtogonon, the egg of the primordial begin-ning) because it [...] holds the undifferentiated potential for any development and generation. It sleeps in the depths of every being and unfolds itself [...] through the chaotic multiplicity of things and forms scattered here below in time and space’.‘The closed line of the ouroboric circle also contains yet another signifi-cance: it indicates the principle of exclusion or closure, the “hermetic sealing” [...]’. A highly significant clue is then given: ‘Here transcendence is understood as a mode of being that is already contained in the “one thing” [i.e., immedi-ately in the “thing” itself and not in any way outside of it—hth]. The “one thing” has a “double sign”: it is at once itself and the overcoming of itself [...] and it contains [within itself—hth] the power to alter and dissolve [itself ]’. There follows from this an entire series of symbolic expressions that articu-late the absolute self-sufficiency of the one principle in all kinds of alchemical “operations”: ‘father and mother of itself ’,40 ‘child of itself ’, ‘dissolved, killed and granted new life by itself ’.41 Completely central to this, though perhaps not immediately understandable, is the formula of the legendary Ostanes (c. 400 bce), which he presented as a key to alchemy: ‘Nature enjoys nature, nature overcomes nature, nature conquers nature’.42 ‘The “matter of the wise”, which is also called their “stone”, contains everything within itself that we need [...]’.43 Evola thereby equates this primordial unity with the ‘matter of the work’ or the ‘prima materia of the wise’, and thus to the beginning point of all further alchemical work.39 Agathodaimon, cited by Olympiodorus in Berthelot, Collection des anciens Alchimistes Grecs, ii, 80; iii, 27.40 Corpus Hermeticum, 4, 5, 8.41 Morienus, Colloque avec le Roi Kalid, in: Salmon, Bibliothèque des Philosophes Chimiques (1741), vol. ii, 86; Evola, lte 1931, 34.

He then cites Dio-nysius Zacharias: ‘When we explain our matter spiritually, so is it true; when we explain it in a corporeal sense, we do not lie; when we call it heavenly, this is its true designation; when we call it earthly, we speak with full precision’.44 Evola adduces even more citations of a similar nature from alchemical works in order to attune even further the consciousness of the reader in the required direction.The prima materia according to Evola is thus the primordial, creative foun-dation from which everything emerges, and with which everything is consub-stantial. It corresponds—extremely significantly—to a completely distinct state of consciousness that appears after the laws of duality between “I” and “not-I” have been withdrawn. I would also add that in Taoism, this withdrawal corresponds to the Tao.45 This state of consciousness is the proper one in which to conduct alchemical operations. Hence there are required many repetitions of specific alchemical procedures to discover the optimal, timeless point. Evola himself believes that the nous, or intellectual intuition (Anschauung) in the sense of German idealism (e.g., Fichte and Schelling), also comes into effect here.This can be understood in terms of the ability for the immediate realization of the principles of our knowing and of reality (an ability that Kant denied to humanity). Guénon’s concept of ‘intellectual intuition’ also belongs here.On the whole, like most Hermetic-alchemical texts, Evola summarizes the ‘Great Work’ of alchemy in three symbolic phases: the nigredo—the black work, which corresponds to the complete sealing off or killing of the habitual, corporeal ego, whose narrowness and density is broken open; next there is the albedo—the white work—which manifests in an ecstatic opening up, and in the experience of light, which in fact remains passive and, as it were, is “suf-fered” or “endured” from the “outside”; and finally there follows the rubedo—the red work—in which, by means of a strengthening of the fire, the self- determining masculine quality becomes activated in absolute freedom, which then enables the achievements to be “fixed”.4644 Denis Zacaire, De la vraye Philosophie naturelle des Métaux, in: Salmon, Bibliothèque des Philosophes Chimiques (1741), vol. ii, 523.45 Twice—in 1923 and 1959—Evola published completely different adaptations and com-mentaries on the Tao Te Ching.46 See the summary in Evola, Il cammino del cinabro (The Path of Cinnabar), 109f."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"347The Symbology Of Hermeticism In The Work Of Julius Evola <UN>Admittedly, this breakdown of Hermetic symbols by Evola is neither imme-diately nor easily graspable. It requires multiple repetitions in order to let the images sink in and, what is more, it encompasses all of his works. Even his political writings must be read from this ‘interior point of view’ if one wants to follow the intentions of the author.Within the scope of this essay, it is of course impossible to account for all alchemical symbols in a comprehensive manner. This, however, is not even our purpose. Indeed, here only a general insight into Evola’s comprehension of symbols shall be furnished. Whoever is interested in pursuing the practi-cal implementation and “Traditional” explication of the individual symbols in the sense indicated by Evola only needs to acquire a copy of The Hermetic Tradition.Some fundamental pointers and clarifications on Evola’s method of inter-pretation shall nevertheless be provided. A particularly important symbol in alchemy is sulphur. If one looks at the symbol for sulphur c, one sees an upward-pointing triangle on top of a cross. The upward-pointing triangle sym-bolically stands for fire, whose upward rising flame signifies the striving for transcendence. The cross, for its part, is the quaternary of the four ancient ele-ments of which all earthly things are composed. Taken together, the symbol of sulphur thus expresses a substance in which the fiery, transcendent element has raised itself above the earthly sphere and thereby “rules” the elements. This already shows itself in the ancient Greek designation, theion, which means both ‘sulphur’ and ‘divine’. In a “transformed” sense, sulphur thus corresponds to the ‘divine soul’47 subsisting in the unliberated human will.48Equally significant is salt (h, j) the corporeal element. ‘If the philoso-phers speak of the earth, they understand by this nothing other than the body, and by the body nothing other than salt’, deduces the De pharmaco catholico.49 To this Evola adds that ‘the perception of an external, material world’, portrays a ‘concretization (petrification) of the spiritual world’, which ‘is created by the corporeal senses’, which are a result of the ‘power of salt’. It is indeed an ‘inter-ruption of the realization’ due to a break of the connections between the form-less spiritual world and the “I” or ego of the corporeal senses. What is effective here is the dualism between the I and not-I. And here, salt, body, stone and earth are equivalent.47 Unlike many philosophical systems, the “soul” in alchemy describes the divine part in humanity, whereas the “spirit” synthesizes the entirety of the pycho-vital energies.

How-ever, it is ruled by the circle, f, the primordial chaos without a centre, which stands above it. In the highest position is the sign of the moon. Taken together, the earthly element is thus ruled by the “fluctuating, feminine” moon, and be-cause of this it is not subject to any clear-cut orientation or direction (unlike sulphur, which is clearly oriented upwards). Mercury is thereby determined by feminine, passive forces (the metallic quicksilver is “therefore” highly reactive and volatile, and thus bonds very easily with other elements). Because of this it is also identified with the treacherous, vascillating “waters”, ♒. The original name of quicksilver, argentum vivum (living silver) is also explained here by the fact that it takes the form of small, fluid, silver-coloured globules that roll to and fro as if they were “alive”. Thus, whereas sulphur is identified with the (di-vine) soul and salt with the body, mercury is identified with the third element of the human being—the (humid) spirit. With mercury, life—the entirety of the psycho-vital energies—is indicated.‘There are three different substances and three principles of all bodies—salt, sulphur and mercury, which are the spirit, the soul, and the body’, says the Triomphe Hermétique.50 Sendivogius is more precise: ‘The body is the earth, the spirit is the water, and the soul is the fire, i.e., the sulphur of gold’.51With mercury, however, one encounters a dichotomy: on one hand, mercury is portrayed with the sign of the moon (☾) in the highest position (a), and on the other hand it is depicted with the sign of Aries (♈) in the highest position (b). Because Aries is, astrologically speaking, a fire sign, it alters the ruling prin-ciple and thus the overall meaning of the symbol. It is considered a ‘burning’ or ‘enflamed water’, and thus coheres with the fire or soul element. With this it becomes a force of life that is penetrated or imbued with a spiritual, masculine quality.Taken together, Evola summarizes the quaternary of human principles as follows:First, one finds an earthly nature in humanity, which is called Saturn (♄). The power of the earth works through it, which determines and perpetu-ates the heavy, steadfast and solid mode of being associated with the ani-mal body (our lead). It manifests above all in the skeleton.50 iii, 302. This here is only an enumeration; the analogous allocation is naturally: body, soul and spirit. Cited in Evola lte 1931, 55 (tht, 45 n. 2).

It manifests itself in the so-called fluid or astral body, the Egyptian ka. Mercury also governs the capacity for sensitivity (impressionability), and the imagina-tion, in which (among other places) the ‘illusory images of (corporeal) things are ignited’.Next comes the mercury that bears the fire of Aries, in which an inner penetration by the divine principle of the soul has already taken place.Finally, we have the intellectual mode of being, which is the gold (the sun, g) in the human being. It is the centre, the indestructible, eternal essence of the soul, which is the origin of individuality and which must lead the remaining principles, even though in and of itself it is beyond in-dividuality (the atman in Indian philosophy). It is equivalent to the nous, the transcendent-intellectual principle that is able to perceive the “eter-nal” Platonic ideas. It is the ‘standing and not falling soul’ in the sense of Agrippa, and the ‘fire of the stone’ mentioned in many Arabic alchemical texts.4 The Monas Hieroglyphica and the Magical-Heroic World of Cesare della RivieraWith these associations one can readily perceive the direction in which Evola’s alchemical symbology proceeds. We now wish to devote ourselves specifi-cally, albeit briefly, to another symbol that holds a particular significance in the history of Hermeticism: the Monas Hieroglyphica,52 which fundamentally symbolizes the unity of the cosmos with its ‘eight heavens, seven planets and four elements’. In accordance with the analogy between macrocosm and mi-crocosm, it also represents the human being and its constituting principles.This symbol is composed of the moon, the sun, the elemental cross and a somewhat unusual-looking sign of Aries.53 According to Evola, who treats this symbol54 (based on Cesare della Riviera)55 in considerable depth, it specifical-ly portrays the starting condition of the unliberated, earthly human. The sun 52 On the significance of this symbol, see the extremely instructive article by Forshaw, ‘The Early Alchemical Reception of John Dee’s Monas Hieroglyphica’.53 That it really signifies Aries and therefore “fire” is confirmed by both John Dee (Monas Hieroglyphica, 1564, Theorem X. 9) and Cesare della Riviera (see note 55).54 Evola, tht, 42–43ff.55 della Riviera, Il Mondo Magico degli Heroi (1605), 24."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Hakl350<UN>and the moon are depicted in their “vulgar” state, and as such, they merely represent the external functions of habitual waking consciousness by which the corporeal elements are thus directed. These stand, moreover, in subordi-nation to the primordial masculine, igneous form (the sign of Aries), which is imbued with generative, procreative power (the ‘dark world’ of Johann Georg Gichtel).56 The Hermetic objective at this point is to separate the individual constituents in the fire by means of the alchemical Scheidung (separation or dissolution). Here, the fire must be transformed from the downward-directed, earthly fire of sexuality into the upward-directed, ‘divine’ fire. In this way the elements can be transformed so that they can form the ‘transcendent’ human, or as Cesare della Riviera expresses it, in order ‘to shift the heroes to heaven by divine wisdom and to make them lords of the magical universe’.57 This corre-sponds precisely to what György E. Szönyi, in his book on John Dee (1527–1608), calls exaltatio.58 With this concept he comprehends ‘a doctrine, according to which the human being—with the assistance of certain techniques (including magic)—is able to bring about a state in which it is possible for him to leave the body and seek coexistence with the godhead’.59Even though Evola’s symbolic method undoubtedly places a very interest-ing tool at the disposal of the modern reader, as well as providing a possible entry-point into the complex world of alchemical-Hermetic symbols, it must naturally remain to be seen how far this “modern” interpretation of Evola’s cor-responds to that of Dee and the Renaissance, for Evola utilizes a thoroughly “essentialist”, ahistorical conception of alchemy that constantly remains inde-pendent of time and place.Here is not the place to give a more detailed analysis of this symbol. This has already been done by John Dee in his book, Monas Hieroglyphica (1564).60 Attention need only be drawn to the fact that the deciphering of symbols by Cesare della Riviera is fundamentally similar to Dee’s (even though della Riv-iera does not acknowledge Dee). It appears however, that for della Riviera, the 56 Gichtel, Theosophia Practica (1723), table 1. An extraordinary interpretation of Gichtel’s work is provided in an article by Arvo and ea (in all likelihood pseudonyms of Evola): ‘La dottrina esoterica dei “centri” in un mistico cristiano’, ur 1928, volume 1, 10–27 (The Esoteric Doctrine of the Body’s Secret Centres according to a Christian Mystic).57 della Riviera, Il Mondo Magico degli Heroi, 25.58 Szönyi, John Dee’s Occultism: Magical Exaltation through Powerful Signs.59 Ibid., 34–37.60 A little known but comprehensively annotated edition is John Dee, Die Monas- Hieroglyphe: Mit Einführung und Anmerkungen von Agnes Klein.

In it-self, the title of della Riviera’s work, Il Mondo Magico degli Heroi, contains two words that must have drawn the particular interest of Evola: magico, ‘magic’ and heroi, ‘heroes’. Evola saw the same final goal in ‘high magic’61 that he found in alchemy (which not only guides man from lead to gold, but also the “metals”)—namely: the reshaping of the earthly human into the transcenden-tal ‘god man’, including physical immortality. The “heroic” virtues, too, must have equally aroused his approval, for in the Renaissance (e.g., Giordano Bru-no’s eroici furori) and for della Riviera, they expressed the transcendent “he-roic” drive (as opposed to the “mystical” drive) of man to become god, and this certainly coincided with Evola’s intentions.A year after the first edition of La tradizione ermetica in 1931, Evola also published a version of Cesare della Riviera’s main work in modernized Italian through the same publisher (Laterza, Bari),62 which he prefaced with an ex-planatory introduction. Herein he emphasizes that in this work, the “timeless” Traditional science was able to come to a completely lucid expression despite the many “coverings” that were added in order to prevent accusations from the church and other “scoria”. The significance of this book is also known in other circles. For instance, it forms the basis of the recent “occult” novel, The Forbid-den Book,63 which, in contrast to the thrillers of Dan Brown, is based upon the solid historical and esoteric research of Joscelyn Godwin. Even if the authors have allowed themselves some poetic liberties (it is after all a novel), Godwin is a well-recognized scholar of esotericism.5 A Parallel to Evola’s Understanding of Symbols, Its Sources, and Its Subsequent ReceptionAt this point I would like to turn to something completely different: namely, the astonishing resemblances between the spiritual symbology of Iranologist, 61 Whoever studies the three volumes of his Ur Group will find not only specific, practically-oriented articles on the “working” of the “metals”, but also translations of alchemical texts ranging from the Turba Philosophorum to Gerhard Dorn’s Clavis philosophiae chemisticae.62 Interestingly enough, this new edition was proposed by the famous idealistic philosopher (and occasional Italian Minister for Education) Benedetto Croce in a letter from 23.1.1932 (see Coli, Croce, Laterza e la cultura europea, 223). To what extent he was influenced by Evola is unknown.63 Mina di Sospiro and Godwin, The Forbidden Book (2012)."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Hakl352<UN>Henry Corbin (1903–1978) and that of Evola. Although Corbin derives his sym-bology from Sufism and Evola from alchemy, both rest upon an “esoteric” (in a broader sense) point of access. Although Corbin’s work is contemporary with Evola’s, I am not aware of any contact between them, nor of any references to each other in their respective works.Corbin’s central concept is the “imaginal world” (mundus imaginalis), which he conceives as a mediator between the absolutely unknowable God and our earthly world. It represents a mesocosm or intermonde through which divine forces are able to work upon our world.The imaginal world, according to Corbin, is the world of symbols in the deepest sense, a place where ‘the spirit is corporealized and the body spiritual-ized’, an expression which immediately recalls the previously cited statement by the alchemist Zacharias.64 As such, the mundus imaginalis represents the necessary binding link between this earthly realm and the transcendent, and in this sense it should not be confused in any way with a world of arbitrarily assignable mathematical symbols or allegories. In Corbin’s view, only through this “true” imaginal world can we find the ‘way back to God’. This is also the world of the ‘eternal present’, and thus a timeless “eternity”, in which the sym-bols always preserve their same spiritual meaning. The consonance with Evola is unmistakable.Corbin designates the so-called imaginatio vera as the sole and single ac-cess to the imaginal world and calls it also the “active imagination” in order to distinguish it from mere phantasy. This true imagination allows the realiza-tion of knowledge in the highest and most comprehensive sense for Corbin; as such it is a matter of a spiritual meaning and in no way should it be confused with a mere imagery. Evola makes the same claim in his previously described “Traditional method” of acquiring knowledge (in a higher sense). In any case, both methods rest upon spiritual faculties that, although stimulated by earthly symbols or writings, are nevertheless allegedly capable of perceiving “facts ” of a higher plane. Yet Evola speaks only generally about the perception of powers on a subtle level that are then “concretized” on the earthly plane. I must leave it therefore open as to whether this “subtle” plane is ultimately identical with Corbin’s imaginal world.Although on one hand they are basically existing in man, the spiritual fac-ulties of perception postulated by Corbin and Evola must nevertheless be cultivated and developed. They rest on the foundation of the ancient expres-sion of analogia according to which like can only be known by like.

This epistemology is perhaps expressed most clearly by Plotinus (c.204–270 ce) in his Enneads: ‘For he that beholds must be akin to that which he beholds, and must, before he comes to this vision, be trans-formed into its likeness. Never could the eye have looked upon the sun had it not become sun-like, and never can the soul see Beauty unless she has become beautiful. Let each man first become god-like and each man beautiful, if he would behold Beauty and God.’65 This type of “hermeneutic” is described by Corbin using the Arabic expression ta’wil, which literally means ‘to lead some-thing back to its origin, to its genuine reality’.In order to set this active imagination on its course, we need “images”. These can be mandalas, symbols, or other images that emerge in us through the use of corresponding poetic or meditative texts. Only through the mediating func-tion of this ‘active imagination’, a function of the heart in the terminology of Corbin (and Evola), is it possible for us to make any contact at all with the pure, but principally unknowable world of the highest spirit, as well as any genu-ine, lived, religious and mystical experience. As a result, Corbin is further con-vinced that ‘with the loss of the imaginatio vera and the mundus imaginalis, nihilism and agnosticism begins’.66 If one were to substitute here “Traditional method” and “Traditional world”, Evola would completely agree.Some sources of Evola’s notions concerning Hermetic symbology have al-ready been given. In the above-mentioned Ur Group, next to Arturo Reghini,67 particular attention must also be drawn to Ercole Quadrelli, who operated under the name Abraxa.68 Quadrelli also belonged to the magical group Fra-tellanza terapeutica e magica di Myriam of Giuliano Kremmerz (1861–1930), whose internal booklet, Fascicolo D, is likewise cited as a source in The Hermet-ic Tradition. According to Evola’s own testimony,69 it provided the foundations 65 Ennead I.6.9, trans. Thomas Taylor, Collected Writings of Plotinus (1994).66 Corbin ‘Prélude à la deuxième édition - Pour une charte de l’Imaginal’, 13.67 In his magical magazines Athanor and Ignis (1924, 1925), which Evola also collaborated upon, more serious contributions to alchemy had already been published by Reghini. Central among them is Un’Ode Alchemica in Ignis, (1925), with the commentary by Reghi-ni (under the pseudonym Maximus); among other things, he speaks of immortality as the purpose of alchemy.68 Here his particularly excellent article on the “waters” should be mentioned, along with the two treatises on the work of the “hermetic staff of Mercury” (both in the first volume of the ur series).

Jacopo da Coreglia70 additionally reveals that a Hermetically oriented priest, Father Francesco Oliva, who was impressed with Evola, provided him with the confidential documents from Myriam.Until now, little attention has been paid to Oswald Wirth’s apparently very significant influence on Evola’s Hermetic work. To be sure, Wirth’s name is mentioned by Evola, and has already been cited in the present article twice, but there it pertained to more specific questions. If, however, one looks more carefully through the 46 pages of the first chapter of Wirth’s Le Symbolisme Hermétique (first edition, 1909), which bears the title ‘L’Idéographisme alchi-mique’, one recognizes how Evola’s “geometrical” interpretation of symbols (circle, square, triangle) has already been clearly anticipated. Naturally, this interpretation is already present in John Dee or Cesare della Riviera, as we have seen. It is marvelously summarized by Wirth though, and is recapitulated in Evola in a similar sense, following the same structural schematic (albeit in a somewhat expanded form). The chapter ‘Notions élémentaires d’Hermétisme’ is also perfectly encapsulated by Evola.The methodology of the well known explorer of matriarchy Johann Jakob Bachofen (1815–1887) has without doubt influenced Evola’s interpretation of symbols and his “traditional method” quite heavily, too. One should not forget that he was the editor and translator of an anthology of Bachofen’s writings.71That Evola’s interpretation of alchemy would be considered a fundamen-tally valuable contribution to the field is attested to by its reception in Jung and Eliade. Though Evola was a staunch opponent of Jung’s psychological in-terpretation of alchemy,72 Jung (1875–1961) himself was quite taken with the Tradizione Ermetica, calling it ‘a magisterial portrayal of hermetic philosophy’. A page later he cites an entire paragraph from the book.7370 A pseudonym, behind which an important personality of the Italian esoteric scene is con-cealed. This information stems from his essay ‘Julius Evola Alchimista’, 48ff.71 Bachofen, Le madri e la virilità olimpica (1949).72 When La Tradizione Ermetica appeared in 1931, Jung had written nothing at all yet on al-chemy, hence he is not mentioned there. In the third edition of 1971 (the last one revised by Evola), Jung’s interpretation is completely rejected. Much earlier than this, however, Evola, who in his youth had apparently been quite taken with Sigmund Freud, turned strongly against Jung, most notably in his 1932 book Maschera e volto dello spiritual-ismo contemporaneo (1932), 35f. This, moreover, was at a time when Jung was relatively unknown.73 Jung, Gesammelte Werke (1972), vol. xii, Psychologie und Alchemie, 267 and 282 (first edi-tion, 1944)."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"355The Symbology Of Hermeticism In The Work Of Julius Evola <UN>With Mircea Eliade, who had been in contact with Evola since he [Eliade] was quite young, the situation is somewhat more complex. An extremely de-tailed and knowledgeable study of the influences of the Traditionalists on Eliade, to include Evola’s conception of alchemy, has been presented by the religious scholar Paola Pisi.74 What she points out in particular are the numer-ous parallels between Eliade’s works, Alchimia Asiatica (1934) and Cosmologie si Alchimie Babiloniana (1937) on the one hand, and Evola’s works on alchemy on the other. Historically, however, it must be noted that Evola’s works clearly occur before the Eliadean works.75Already in 1925, Evola had published an essay in the journal Bilychnis76 (which was also known to Eliade) in which he presented one of his founda-tional alchemical concepts for the first time. Above all, the motif of the so-called resurrection body emerges here in the same sense as in Eliade’s Alchimia Asiatica. Between 1927 and 1929, in the magazines Ur and Krur, which were edited by Evola and to which Eliade subscribed, one also finds further articles by Evola on alchemical themes.77 Equally important in this connection is the very detailed essay of Evola’s, La dottrina della palingenesi nell’ermetismo me-dioevale (The Doctrine of Palingenesis in Medieval Hermeticism) which ap-peared in 1930, again in the journal Bilychnis.78Ioan P. Culianu’s claim that the Eliadean works on alchemy represent a significant ‘moment in the interpretation of alchemy’, as at least the Alchimia Asiatica chronologically preceded the interpretations of the analytical psy-chologist Carl Jung, is therefore unjustified,79 especially when one considers 74 Here I only reiterate what I have already written in my essay ‘Mircea Eliade, Julius Evola und die Integrale Tradition’, 11ff.75 See Pisi, ‘I ‚tradizionalisti’ e la formazione del pensiero di Eliade’, 49f. and 91f. In 1999, Paola Pisi once again took up the question of Alchemy in Evola and Eliade, most notably in her solidly documented contribution ‘Evola, Eliade e l’alchimia’. Moreover a very detailed ar-ticle by Liviu Bordas, ‘The Magic Fact and the Mystic Fact: Eliade’s First Encounter with the Works of Evola’, has been published recently, which investigates the early relation-ship of Evola and Eliade. There also exists a letter of Evola to Walter Heinrich (successor to Othmar Spann, with whom he cooperated during his stay in Vienna) of 29/8/1952, in which Evola explicitly writes: ‘Indeed, Eliade was already a subscriber to “Ur”.’76 Della „purità“ come valore metafisico (On ‘Purity’ as a Metaphyical Value), currently in Julius Evola, I saggi di Bilychnis, (1987), 24–38.77 Only a single example shall be adduced here: the multi-part article by Evola (under the pseudonym Ea), ‘La tradizione ermetica’, in Krur 1929, 154f., which represents the skeleton of his later book.78 Currently in Evola, I saggi di Bilychnis, 96–118.79 See Culianu, Mircea Eliade, 49."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Hakl356<UN>how Culianu substantiates this claim. He points out two foundational innova-tions of Eliade: first he (allegedly) discovered that alchemy was not chemistry in its infancy, but had a spiritual origin,80 and second, it was Eliade who had drawn attention to the central motif of death and rebirth in alchemy. Eliade himself specifies in his autobiography that in his early alchemical writings he had wanted to prove that alchemy was no “rudimentary chemistry”, but a “spiritual technology” that did not aim at the “conquest of matter”. It had much more to do with the “salvation” or “liberation” of man. Eliade even adds: ‘Twen-ty years after the appearance of Alchimia Asiatica, the interpretation that I pro-posed is now almost unanimously accepted’.81In the foreword to his Cosmologie si Alchimie Babiloniana, Eliade also speaks of a ‘new method for the exploration of cultural philosophy’ as well as of a “revolutionary method”. The “innovations” noted by him, however, undoubt-edly had been anticipated by Evola’s writings, as noted here already, and by quite a number of years.82 Eliade, too, only mentioned Evola’s Hermetic Tradi-tion for the first time in 1956,83 in his book Forgerons et Alchimistes, and there only parenthetically.84Following from what has been said, there is one further point that I would like to mention because it touches on the modern history of Hermeticism and 80 Here one must also acknowledge the pioneering role of Mary Anne Atwood’s book, A Suggestive Enquiry into the Hermetic Mystery (1850). It is worth noting that Evola was in all likelihood aware of this book, for it was mentioned in Ultra xx, 1 (Gennaio-Febbraio 1926, 9) around the same time that he published in it.81 See Eliade, Autobiography, Volume i, 1907–1937, 55f.82 Regarding this, Paola Pisi suggests that before Evola, René Guénon had also put similar thoughts to paper, albeit not as elaborate.83 Thus, long after C.G. Jung’s mention of this work in his Psychologie und Alchimie.84 See the expanded edition of Mircea Eliade’s Forgerons et Alchimistes (The Forge and the Crucible, 1977), 133. To be sure, he ascribes to Guénon and Evola ‘much specialized knowl-edge’. Evola is also mentioned in the footnotes (e.g., 132) and briefly in the text itself (119), where he is named alongside figures such as Alexander von Bernus, Fulcanelli or Eugène Canseliet, which could hardly have pleased Evola, for he did not share their interpreta-tions at all. For example, Evola never mentions the writings of Canseliet, the famous French alchemist (and editor of Fulcanelli) at all. Canseliet, however, appears to have val-ued Evola’s work. This is attested to by the fact that he personally sent Evola a copy of the work of Basilius Valentinus that he edited and annotated, Les douze clefs de la philosophie (Paris: Ed. du Minuit, 1956), which is now a part of a private library. In this volume, one finds a long, hand-written dedication by him, in which he holds Evola ‘in respect for his (i.e., Evola’s) transcendent work’."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"357The Symbology Of Hermeticism In The Work Of Julius Evola <UN>its reception in the academic world. Professor Emeritus, art historian and art critic Maurizio Calvesi, who was one of the first to investigate alchemy from an art historical perspective, underscores ‘the originality and importance’85 of Evola’s Tradizione Ermetica, which for the first time incorporated alchemy within the Hermetic tradition and emphasized their intimately interwoven nature. Evola, moreover, had given an interpretation valid also for the compre-hension of the Hermetic tradition in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.86 Even thirty years later, Calvesi underlined, the significance of alchemy was still un-clear to Frances Yates in her classic Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (1964). And indeed, the alchemical references in her book are few and far be-tween. Alongside the Corpus Hermeticum, Yates treated Renaissance astrology and magic in particular. This may have been based upon D.P. Walker’s book, Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino to Campanella (1964), which was the first to bring Hermetic doctrine into connection with Renaissance magic. Aca-demic research that places alchemy in an intellectual historical context, e.g., Wayne Shumaker’s, The Occult Sciences in the Renaissance: A Study in Intellec-tual Patterns, appears even later (1972).87 Two of the best known intellectual historians of the Renaissance, Paul Oskar Kristeller (1905–1999) and Eugenio Garin (1909–2004), despite their truly enormous written production, have, at least to my knowledge, scarcely paid any attention to alchemy. Even in 1988, Eugenio Garin, in his Ermetismo del Rinascimento (Hermeticism in the Renais-sance) provides no references to alchemy.For this reason, Paolo Lucarelli (1940–2005), who graduated as a physicist and researched metals in Italy at the National Research Council (cnr) and lat-er quit his job in order to dedicate himself more completely to alchemy, criti-cized the condition of current scholarship on alchemy. In 1999, at a conference on the alchemical tradition in the twentieth century,88 he deplored the fact that one cannot find the name of Evola in any academic book on Hermeticism, even though Evola’s Tradizione Ermetica actually represents the foundational epistemology of alchemy.Piero di Vona, Emeritus Professor of philosophy and Spinoza specialist, also emphasizes the significance of La Tradizione Ermetica, which he describes at 85 de Turris (ed.), ‘La tradizione ermetica’, 49.86 One can certainly disagree with this.87 Shumaker, The Occult Sciences in the Renaissance, 160–200.88 L’Altra Sapienza, organized by the Associazione Alpi marittime.

On this point I would like to note however that it is precisely the multiplicity of the symbolic images used by Evola that facilitates access—but certainly not a completely rational access—to understanding. Apparently one needs a little bit of exaltatio to understand the symbology, which perhaps is not easy for an academic philosopher even if he is sympathetic towards Evola.At the end of this essay, which hopefully hasn’t been as confusing as some of the alchemical images and symbols, I would also like to draw attention to three in my view equally important points in Evola’s understanding of alchemical symbols, but which unfortunately I cannot treat here in any detail. The first point concerns Evola’s artistic work in his youth, where he was a leading col-laborator in Italian Futurism and in particular Dadaism. In his paintings and poems, recurring alchemical symbols and concepts emerge. These connec-tions have been analyzed by Elisabetta Valento in her book, Homo faber: Julius Evola fra arte e alchimia (Homo Faber: Julius Evola between Art and Alchemy). The second point concerns Evola’s classification of the alchemical elements into masculine and feminine, which gives rise to a “dry” and a “wet” way, as well as the confluence of these into the androgyne. Here Evola mixes in his very personal, almost Manichaean interpretation of the sexes, which has multiple sources. Chief among them are the philosopher Otto Weininger (1880–1903), the “Matriarchist”, Johann Jakob Bachofen (whom Evola completely reinter-prets), as well as Tantrism. The third essential point is Evola’s attempt to por-tray alchemy as a royal-heroic path to transcendence. With this he wanted to assert the primacy of the royal, warrior caste (kshatriya) over the priestly caste (brahmin), which, among other things, brought him into an inescapable and unresolvable conflict with his mentor, René Guénon.In order to prevent misunderstandings, it shall clearly be noted once more that Evola’s alchemical work was written neither as a scholar nor as a practical alchemist working with earthly metals, but purely and simply to demonstrate the “truth” of his Traditional worldview.

In the course of history artists often sought to conceptualize and represent the invisible, the ineffable and the sacred, while various belief and religious systems engaged art as a vehicle for conveying spiritual meaning. This relation-ship was dominant in the late nineteenth century during the so-called “occult revival”, when heterodox religiosity and anti-materialist philosophies exerted an impact upon several painters, poets and intellectuals. Contemporaneous studies in psychology and psychiatry also placed particular emphasis on the importance of inner life and art was often seen as the mirror of the soul. Recent scholarship has established the modernist fascination with esotericism3 and traced the influence of esoteric ideas on artistic movements of the avant-garde, such as Symbolism, Orphic Cubism, Expressionism, Dada and Surrealism.41 Breton, ‘On Surrealism in its Living Works (1953)’, 301–302.2 Yeats, ‘Among School Children’, cited in Colquhoun, Goose of Hermogenes, 33.3 In this article the term “esotericism” will be utilised as an equivalent of “Western esoteri-cism”, whereas “occultism” is understood as a subcategory of esotericism that refers to the development of esoteric currents in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The terms “occult” and “occult sciences”, although different in content, will be used interchangeably with “occultism” for convenience only. For a concise account of the history of the terms and their scholarly usage see Hanegraaff et al (eds.), Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism, 337–338, 884–889.4 On a comprehensive study and overview of the interrelation between modern art and eso-tericism, see Tuchman et al.

I am speaking of astrology, among the oldest ... metaphysics ... among the modern’.6 Breton himself and his comrades in Paris showed an interest in the “occult sciences” in the 1920s, but it was from the mid-1930s and particularly from the 1940s and beyond that occultism and more generally esotericism informed surrealism: surrealist reading included esoteric books; esoteric images and ideas made their appearance in surrealist writings and artworks; occultist techniques were adopted as an avenue for the recuperation of the mind’s powers and the en-hancement of artistic creativity. Yet the impact of esotericism was not of equal importance to all surrealists; several exhibited no interest; others appreciated the multi-layered symbolism of esoteric language and experimented with the artistic potential of esoteric motifs; and certain others were involved in the ex-ploration of esotericism so that their work was fuelled by their studies in terms of imagery and structure. This marriage of esotericism and art is particularly evident in the work of British surrealist Ithell Colquhoun, an artist, writer and occultist who was born in India in 1906 and died in Cornwall in 1988.7Widely read in esoteric literature, Colquhoun borrowed ideas from esoteri-cism and made it the basis of her visual and verbal language. Her esoteric preoc-cupations are attested to by her private collection of papers bequeathed to the Tate Archive.8 Her book collection also offers valuable insight into her esoteric the way to a re-assessment of the interaction between esotericism and modernism, often thought of as unworthy of academic study in the past, and spurred an interest in the work of individual artists influenced by esoteric currents.

Last but not least, Colquhoun applied for membership and was admitted to occult circles thriving in Great Britain in the twentieth century.10 To sum up, Colquhoun was not merely enjoying esotericism but was also a practising occultist.Colquhoun’s preoccupation with esotericism encompasses alchemy, magic, Rosicrucianism, the Kabbalah, Gnosticism, the Tarot, astrology, Theosophy, Neoplatonism, Christian mysticism, Celtic lore and Eastern spirituality. Alongside her esoteric researches, Colquhoun was also intrigued with the ad-vent of scientific psychology. She was acquainted with the work of the Austrian psychoanalyst and Freemason Herbert Silberer and the Swiss psychiatrist and founder of analytical psychology Carl G. Jung, owned books discussing the psy-chology of the unconscious and dream symbolism, underwent psychotherapy and occasionally commented on the interrelationship between occultism, and most specifically alchemy, and psychology.11 This double fascination is not surprising since occultist pursuits and psychology have been seen as comple-mentary routes since the late nineteenth century.12 As Alex Owen remarks, in post-war Britain ‘an interest in the occult and psychoanalysis often went hand in hand’.13 Mead’s Quest Society, an occultist group Colquhoun joined in 1928, 9 See Colquhoun’s private collection of books.10 In 1928 she became a member of Mead’s Quest Society. In the 1930s she was a candi-date for joining the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn but failed to be accepted. In the 1950s she did not gain admittance to Dion Fortune’s Society of Inner Light, but she joined Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis (1952) and was admitted to Kenneth Grant’s New Isis Lodge (1955); in the 1960s she participated in rituals held by the Druid Order, was conferred a deaconess of the Ancient Celtic Church and became a member of several Masonic lodges; in the 1970s she was ordained a Priestess of Isis by the Fellowship of Isis (1977).

This is the notion of coniunctio oppositorum, a Latin term for the fusion of polar opposites into one entity. The coincidence of contraries is a structural principle of esoteric lore and specifically alchemy;15 but it is also central to Jung’s psychological theories and especially his individuation pro-cess. In alchemy it generally signifies the unification and merging of the two opposing, sexually differentiated substances of the primal matter to produce the elixir of life and/or the philosophers’ stone, which could transmute base metals into gold and ‘the alchemist himself, or of all mankind through him from, a base, earthly state into a more noble, more spiritual, more moral, or more divine state’.16 In Jungian psychology it stands for the coexistence of “dia-lectical opposites in the psyche” and the development of the integrated self.17 In both cases coniunctio oppositorum symbolizes the resolution of duality and the attainment of oneness.Colquhoun’s appreciation of alchemy as a monistic system of thought is re-vealed as early as 1930. In her first published esoteric article she notes:The Dark Ages lacked much that the twentieth century possesses; but they held one thing which this age may well envy: an imaginative unity of outlook on the universe. This unity appeals by contrast to the modern mind, variedly active. An oft-quoted saying of the times was the chief 14 Ibid.15 Alchemy is not a static monolithic tradition but has developed in various ways from an-tiquity to the present day in the context of different cultures. As a body of practical and theoretical knowledge, it is connected to both scientific and spiritual developments in Western culture since the ancient times. Alchemy has been variously defined as the art of metallurgical transmutation and a precursor of chemistry, as a form of medicine, as religious/spiritual tradition, as nature-philosophy, as psychology. See Hanegraaff et al. (eds.), Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism, 12–16; see also Principe and Newman, ‘Some Problems with the Historiography of Alchemy’, 385–431. In this article “alchemy” will be used as a loose term while Colquhoun’s reading of the alchemical tradition will be explained in due course.16 Principe and Newman, ‘Some Problems with the Historiography of Alchemy’, 388.17 See Jung, Alchemy and Psychology, 242–287; Jung, Mysterium Coniunctionis, 457–553."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"367The Iconography of ‘Coniunctio Oppositorum’<UN>maxim inscribed upon the Smaragdine Tablet of Hermes: ‘That which is below is as that which is above, and that which is above is as that which is below’. Under the Doctrine of Signatures planet and herb, metal and deity, beast and precious stone, the months of the year and parts of the human body were linked in subtle communion, so that one could not indeed stir a flower without the troubling of a star.18In this excerpt Colquhoun summarizes the idea of the correspondences of all things and the belief that the universe is a unified whole, also recalling Ernst Haechel’s pantheistic philosophical monism. A few paragraphs below, she ex-plains how the medieval search for unity was imaged under the form of the philosophers’ stone or elixir of life:... hermetic art expressed the normal spirit of that epoch, ever seeking the One Thing, the Magnum Bonum, the basis of the cosmos. Though One Thing, this Grand Magisterium was nevertheless a twin conception: the eldest-born was the ‘Lapis Philosophorum’ ...; the second, the Elixir of Life ... The stone was regarded as solid, tangible; the elixir as liquid, portable; but they were, transcending reason, in essence One Thing.19This quest, she is quick to pinpoint, is rather ‘a poetical conception in the mind of the sage than a sober hypothesis in the mind of a scientific investigator’.20 Here Colquhoun not only reflects on the symbolic function of alchemical im-agery but also posits the philosophers’ stone/elixir of life as emblematic of universal unity.Colquhoun’s disparagement of dualistic thinking pervades her visual work and writings. Alchemical thought was a formative influence toward this direction. Her knowledge of alchemy came via the work of Sir George Ripley, Paracelsus, Salomon Trismosin, John Dee, Michael Maier, Basil Valen-tine, Nicholas Barnaud Delphinas, Thomas Vaughan, Eirenaeus Philalethes, Antoine-Joseph Pernety and others. She laid particular emphasis on Aurea Catena Homeri (1722) by alchemical writer Anton Joseph Kirchweger, whose work she prized highly.21 Despite her acquaintance with numerous alchemi-cal treatises of the early modern period, her reading of alchemy was mainly 18 Colquhoun, ‘The Prose of Alchemy’, 294.19 Ibid., 295.20 Ibid.21 In 1979 she published an essay titled ‘Notes on the Colouring of the “Homer’s Golden Chain Diagram”’, 15–17."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Ferentinou368<UN> post-enlightenment and was initially influenced by modern authors promot-ing a spiritual model of alchemy, such as Mary Anne Atwood, Edward Waite and her distant cousin Edward L. Garstin.22 She also drew inspiration from other esoteric currents, often associated with alchemy since the Renaissance and especially in the modern era, such as the Kabbalah, whose principal doc-trine, according to Colquhoun, centered on the harmonious coexistence of groups of balanced opposites in both the microcosm and macrocosm, as is manifested in the Tree of Life.23 However, again, her interpretation of the Kab-balah can be read within the occultist context of the nineteenth century that often identified it with a kind of “psychologized spirituality”.24Colquhoun’s initial preoccupation with the reconciliation of opposites was however more intuitive and came in her childhood years. As she recalls in her unpublished autobiographical notes: ‘If I say that at ten years old I imagined Christ as a hermaphrodite, I shall not be believed. Yet it was so ... I fused the red-hearted Jesus with the blue-cloaked Mary and made a god with breasts ...’.25 Without previous knowledge of esoteric systems, Colquhoun seems to have 22 It is not coincidental that she was particularly fond of early modern authors whose work contains the seeds of nineteenth-century spiritual alchemy, such as Thomas Vaughan, Jacob Boehme and A.J. Kirchweger, and that her writings and notes contain references to Atwood’s Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery (1850) and Waite’s The Hermetic Museum (1893). In addition, she held a card index of alchemical symbolism based on Garstin’s unpublished book A Glossary of Alchemical Terms and had read his Theurgy (1934) and The Secret Fire (1932). Garstin’s works dismissed alchemical practice as physi-cal transmutation and embraced a version of “spiritual alchemy”. See Colquhoun’s card index at tga 929/5/1; Colquhoun, Sword of Wisdom, 277.23 As she admits in her Sword of Wisdom, 17, she owes her first Kabbalistic knowledge to Mathers’s The Kabbalah Unveiled, whose 1926 edition was included in her esoteric li-brary. Her familiarity with the Kabbalah came mainly via nineteenth-century occult sources that re-interpreted Kabbalistic imagery within the context of nineteenth-century occultism. For example, she owned copies of the following books, all of which saw the Kabbalah as the primary tool in magical/spiritual practice: Lévi, The Book of Splendours (1894); Crowley, Liber 777 (1909), Regardie, The Garden of Pomegranates (1932). Westcott’s translations of the Zoharic treatises Sepher Yetzirah (1887), which combined the Kabbal-istic doctrine of the sefirot with alchemy and astrology, and Aesch Mezareph (1894), also figure in her library. On Colquhoun’s interpretation of the Kabbalah and particularly her emphasis on the Tree of Life, in accordance with the Golden Dawn teachings, see her es-says in Nichols, The Magical Writings of Ithell Colquhoun, 17–56.24 For the psychologization of esotericism in the modern era see Hanegraaff, New Age Religion and Western Culture, 482–513.

Her childhood fantasy discloses her wish to reconcile opposites under the androgyne/hermaphrodite, a potent symbol that persisted throughout Western literature, philosophy, reli-gion and art for centuries, but also preoccupied her in her work.26Colquhoun’s fascination with the fusion of polarities should also be read within a surrealist context. In the 1920s Breton and his colleagues in Paris formed the surrealist movement in their endeavor to transform the world and human expression through the dialectic synthesis of the ‘seemingly so contra-dictory’ states of ‘dream and reality ... into a kind of absolute reality, a surre-ality... ’.27 In the same vein, surreality was defined as a new state of awareness, ‘a certain point of the mind at which life and death, the real and the imag-ined, past and future, the communicable and the incommunicable, high and low, cease to be perceived as contradictions’.28 This overcoming of antinomies through the dynamic and dialectical synthesis of the opposing but interacted states of consciousness and unconscious reality, objective fact and imagination lies at the heart of surrealist philosophy, and it is indebted not only to Hegelian dialectics but also very likely to the hermetic doctrine of the conjunction of opposites.29 The resolution of contraries is an underlying theme of surrealist theory, poetry and visual imagery, but also finds expression in surrealist work-ing techniques, such as the collage, defined by the German artist Max Ernst as the visual equivalent of Arthur Rimbaud’s “alchemy of the word”.30Colquhoun was amazed by the abundant creative possibilities opened up by surrealism and she joined the British surrealist group in 1939. Nonetheless, her formal connection to surrealism was short-lived. She was expelled from the surrealist group in Britain the next year because she refused to conform 26 Colquhoun uses the terms “androgyne” and “hermaphrodite” interchangeably. For an analysis of her employment of androgyny from a gender perspective, see Ferentinou, ‘Ithell Colquhoun, Surrealism and the Occult’, 9–17.27 Breton, ‘Manifesto of Surrealism (1924)’, 14.28 Breton, ‘Second Manifesto of Surrealism (1930)’, 123.29 It has been suggested that Hegel’s thought betrays borrowings from the esoteric thought of his time. According to Gibbons, ‘it was the occult doctrine of contraries in its dy-namic form, which was to become the Hegelian and Marxist dialectic of thesis, antith-esis and synthesis’; see Gibbons, Spirituality and the Occult, 10; see also Magee, Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition. Moreover, as Anna Balakian argues, Breton was intrigued with the harmonious coexistence of contraries as articulated in Lévi’s materialist mysticism, which was compatible with twentieth-century scientific thought and had influenced the shaping of surrealist theories; see Balakian, André Breton: Magus of Surrealism, 27–44.30 Ernst, Max Ernst: Beyond Painting, 12."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Ferentinou370<UN>to the strict directives set up by the Belgian E.L.T. Mesens who acted as the leader of British surrealism at the time.31 Among other prescriptions, Mesens demanded that no surrealist should participate in any other groups, includ-ing secret societies. Colquhoun was deeply hurt by this exclusion but operated in the orbit of surrealism until her death. For her, esotericism and surrealism had several affinities and occultism was integral to surrealist aesthetics.32 She further shared with several French surrealists the fascination with the dialecti-cal reconciliation of opposites, the androgynous ideal and the quest for the alchemical gold/philosophers’ stone.Most specifically, Colquhoun showed great interest in multifarious symbols pertaining to the equilibrium of contraries and employed them in pictorial and textual works dating from the 1940s. Drawing primarily from alchemy and the Kabbalah, coniunctio oppositorum is associated with her contemporary explo-ration of sexuality and gender dynamics as part of surrealism’s subversive poli-tics, and of love as the medium through which original paradisiacal unity and bliss could be achieved personally and socially. It is also linked to her search for inner wisdom and psychic wholeness, one of the highest goals of the esoteric adept according to contemporaneous occultism and a shared objective of ana-lytical psychology. The coincidence of contraries is articulated through images that adapt and blend different esoteric symbols to convey her personal reading and re-invention of the concept. Decoding is often difficult but her titles often illustrate her images. Textual parallels also afford us a deep insight. In other words, Colquhoun’s work offers examples of the dialogical relation between word and image. Although these are distinct media of self-expression, they should be read in conjunction with each other and viewed as complementary parts of Colquhoun’s reconfiguration of coniunctio oppositorum.Colquhoun’s exploration of the potential of the concept inaugurates in the late 1930s and is verbally expressed in a theoretical text she wrote at the beginning of the 1940s for the surrealist section of New Road 1943.33 The section contains an anthology of surrealist texts which was compiled by Colquhoun’s partner, Toni del Renzio, a surrealist of Italian and Russian de-scent. Colquhoun’s text, titled ‘The Water-Stone of the Wise’,34 responds to 31 See Colquhoun’s own account in Colquhoun, Surrealism: Paintings, Drawings, Collages 1936–76, unpaginated.

Largely disillusioned with the social solutions offered by left-wing party politics, Breton turned, inter alia, to myths from pre-modern and indigenous cultures and to esotericism as potential sources for the formu-lation of “a new collective mythology” that would articulate ‘the society that we judge to be desirable’.37 As Michael Löwy explains, the surrealist recourse to myth and esoteric traditions was ‘a profane alternative to the irrational grip of religion’ and was bound up with utopian thought and revolutionary politics.38Mingling surrealism, utopianism, alchemy and astrology, Colquhoun intro-duces her “new myth”, which she calls the myth of ‘the Siamese Twins’ or ‘the hermaphrodite whole’.39 She describes it as follows:In one of the planets’ airy houses live the Twins, a boy and a girl, perpetu-ally joined by an ectoplasmic substance which is warmed by the solar and lunar currents of their bodies. They cannot part, nor do anything apart. They eat and breathe each other day and night.They are united face to face, having passed forward to the condition of the androgynous egg. Their faculty is dream, their body-of-fate the stream of images – sensual transpositions – induced by the incandescence of their own body and mind. They have no privacy from each other, and desire none, since theirs is a unity conscious of its own elements. They weigh down equally each scale of the Balance, and as the two Fishes, are held together in watery dance by a single cord.40She must have been acquainted with the text via Waite’s compendium, The Hermetic Mu-seum, a copy of which she owned. Colquhoun considered this ‘anthology of hermetic im-agery’ as one of her ten best books. For the text see Waite, The Hermetic Museum, i, 70–120.

Breton’s concept owes its debt to the Platonic myth of humanity’s primordial androgyny as well to the alchemical imagery of conjugal pairs in the act of procreation to recon-stitute the androgyne, which are freely adapted to suit the needs of surrealist mythopoeia.44Likewise, Colquhoun locates herself within a surrealist context and discuss-es the subversive power of myth and its liberating potency. ‘Myth is a volcanic force’, she notes, and one cannot have liberty ‘without repeated explosions’.45 Nonetheless, she believed that true freedom shall not be found in phallocentric 41 Colquhoun explicitly wove together alchemical and astrological images connoting coni-unctio oppositorum with the originary androgynous creatures of Plato’s Symposium in the novel Goose of Hermogenes, which she started writing during the late 1930s. The image she describes in her text in The New Road 1943 can be therefore counted as a prefiguration of the image she later created in her novel. Colquhoun was very likely influenced by Yeats’s blending of alchemical and Platonic androgyny with the classical myth of Leda and the Swan – whose union resulted in the birth of an egg hatching the Dioskouroi, alias the astrological Gemini – in his poem ‘Among School Children’ (1927) from which she quotes in her novel. In turn, she describes her androgyne/hermaphrodite as a Platonic variant of ‘two beings contained in a single sphere to form a hermaphrodite whole, the androgynous egg’; see Colquhoun, Goose of Hermogenes, 35. On Plato’s myth of primordial androgyny, see Plato, Symposium 189e–191d in Plato’s Symposium, 22–4. On Yeats’s poem see The Col-lected Poems of W.B.

Oedipus will be king no longer but will return to Colonnus (sic).47The Oedipus myth alludes to Sigmund Freud’s famous homonymous sexual theory, which mostly male members of surrealism endorsed but she criticized as a patriarchal theory perpetuating a non-balanced treatment of the sexes.48 Wishing to replace what she considers a myth of sexual and social disparity, Colquhoun offers an alternative expressed through the androgynous ideal; in androgyny all contradictions are annihilated and the body/spirit split is tran-scended. Clearly Colquhoun turns to esoteric symbolism to provide a textual example of sexual and spiritual unity which, from her emic perspective, defies gender binaries and offers a liberatory potential to humankind. In this instance we must appreciate the political relevance of her myth and her contribution to surrealism’s collective mythology. But we should not underestimate her critique of masculinist models of sexuality and proto-feminist revision of an-drogynous fusion, often appropriated in separatist, polarized ways by her male peers.49Colquhoun’s view on coniunctio oppositorum as an equalising and unifying principle is also suggested by pictorial works she executed at the same period. In a series of watercolours she painted at the beginning of the 1940s, entitled Alchemical Figures, Colquhoun explores motifs inspired by alchemy, such as the microcosm, the homunculus, the opal and the androgyne. These im-ages do not faithfully reproduce alchemical illustrations but they reflect her 46 The writings of these two authors triggered off the birth of the terms “masochism” and “sadism” respectively. “Sadism” and “masochism” are, according to Freud, the names given by Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing to ‘the most common and the most significant of all the perversions – the desire to inflict pain upon the sexual object, and its reverse’. See Freud, A case of Hysteria, 157–160.47 Colquhoun, ‘The Water-Stone of the Wise’, 198–199.48 See for example Colquhoun’s manuscript at tga 929/2/1/22.49 Several male surrealists presented a separatist view of androgyny.

The most striking example is Alchemical Figure: Androgyne (1941) that throws light on Colquhoun’s visual version of androgyny: two figures in a state of interaction, merging and integration into a new being within a black egg-shaped space, perhaps a reference to the alchemical alembic.50 The figures are colored differ-ently to represent the antithetical principles at the climax of the conjunction stage of the alchemical opus. Although the selected colours cannot be clearly attributed to male and female respectively, the choice of pink/red-violet and blue connotes opposition and complementarity.51 This work also relies on im-ages of the alchemical androgyne as a dual-sexed being, brought forth by the erotic encounter of red man and white woman, sol and luna, king and queen.52 However Colquhoun’s image does not juxtapose male and female character-istics and is less gendered than the typical alchemical emblems. In her case emphasis is laid upon the process of unification of opposite qualities into an all-embracing state that visually transcends gender lines.Colquhoun investigated the conjunction of opposites in a second series of watercolours from the early 1940s. The general title, Diagrams of Love, reveals her exploration of love and sexuality as is also evidenced in her homonymous series of erotic poems. She writes for example: ‘In phantasmagoric dark/Before sleep in dead of folding/Into myself I was taught to do/I plunge in another being/And touched by tendrils of forest/Or foam of ocean’s tongue/At one 50 For an illustration of the image see Ferentinou, ‘Ithell Colquhoun, Surrealism and the Occult’, 11 fig. 8.51 Colquhoun was interested in the symbolic usage of colours in alchemy, astrology and the Tarot and even wrote essays on the topic; see Colquhoun, ‘The Zodiac and the Flashing Colours’, 5–7; Colquhoun, ‘Colour and the two Sigils,’ 8–10; Colquhoun, ‘Notes on the Colouring of the “Homer’s Golden Chain Diagram”’, 15–17. Colquhoun also used colours symbolically in the set of Tarot cards she designed in 1977, following the instructions given by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn about colour symbolism and its meta-physical value; see the text she wrote for the exhibition of her Tarot pack and published the following year with the title ‘The Taro as Colour’, 31–33. However in other cases, she freely adapted the standard colour symbolism of alchemy and the Kabbalah and most specifically the colour-scales of the Golden Dawn’s Minutum Mundum and Garstin’s co-loured diagram of Kirchweger’s chain in Aurea Catena which she reproduced in her ‘Notes on the Colouring of the “Homer’s Golden Chain Diagram”’, 17. In Sword of Wisdom, 274 she also remarks how the two systems produce similar results in practice. Nevertheless, it is not an easy task to decode her esoteric use of colours which at times is highly complex and frequently reverses, or departs from, standard attributions.52 A good example is ‘The Hermetic Androgyne standing on the Dragon of Nature’ from the Manuscript of Michael Cochem (c. 1530) at the Vadiana Cantonal Library in St. Gallen."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"375The Iconography of ‘Coniunctio Oppositorum’<UN>with you then/I sink into the abyss’.53 Using erotic language reminiscent of the biblical erotic poem Song of Songs, Colquhoun reflects on the complete fusion of oneself with the beloved. Her love is described as a persistent longing for fulfillment, as an inevitable “coincidence” that transcends body and soul: ‘The wise say,/Wipe out/Desire and ensue/The void of bliss/But what is content/If empty of you?’; and a few sequences below: ‘The two moons coincide/What if my head pains me?/You in my heart/Make full-moon always’.54 Colquhoun’s poetry uses tropes of eroticism to designate eros as a sexual/spiritual fusion in keeping with several currents of Western esotericism.55 Her images are equally put under the rubric of “love”, but they are not overtly sexualized in the sense that corporeal consummation is not overtly depicted; the individual subtitles, primarily drawn from alchemical and Kabbalistic imagery, allude to a spiritual reading of the conjunction of opposites and sexual love.In Diagrams of Love: Christian Marriage i (c. 1940–1942), for example, the fusion of polarities is embodied in an abstract, genderless bust (Fig. 15.1). Colquhoun stresses the horizontal and vertical axes of the painting and their 53 tga 929/2/2/6/2.54 Ibid.55 See Hanegraaff and Kripal (eds.), Hidden Intercourse, passim.Figure 15.1Ithell Colquhoun, Diagrams of Love: Christian Marriage i, c. 1940–42, watercolourTate Archive, London. © Samaritans, © Noise Abatement Society & © Spire Healthcare"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Ferentinou376<UN>intersection at the centre, pointing to the cross symbol: two large pairs of lips form a large crucifix on the figure’s chest, while two pairs of eyes and of smaller lips are crossed at right angles on his/her face. The choice of title points to her sources: alchemy, the Kabbalah and Christian mysticism. In all traditions the motif of Hieros Gamos or Sacred Marriage is seminal; roughly speaking, in alchemy the so-called “chemical wedding” designates the reconciliation of opposites to produce a third, highly-refined substance, both physically and spiritually; in the Kabbalah it may signify either the union of the feminine and masculine aspects within God and the restoration of the split of the divine soul into gendered halves, or the union of the Kabbalist with the Divine; in Christian mysticism it stands for the loving communion and spiritual union of humanity with God.56 Drawing from sources particularly promoting a spiri-tual and psychologised understanding of the concept, Colquhoun formulates an image of the complete union of polarities.57 The conjunction is chiefly symbolized by the motif of the cross and by the absence of sexual traits, thus showing that the interaction of opposites equals the complete dissolution of gendered conflicting opposites into a fluid, genderless unit. In this case coni-unctio oppositorum is also indicated through the juxtaposition of contrasting colous: blue for the bust and orange-red for the crossed lips, two colours that connote antithesis and complementarity in the typical alchemical and astro-logical colour symbolism as transmitted through the Golden Dawn teachings.58 Moreover, to create a ‘flashing effect’, capable of raising self- consciousness, Colquhoun paints a purple background, very likely a by-product of the mixture 56 For the symbolism of the concept see Voss, ‘The Hierosgamos Theme’, 144–153; 149–156; Idel, ‘Sexual Metaphors and Praxis in the Kabbalah’, 197–224; King, Christian Mystics, passim.57 Colquhoun’s conception of the wedding is eclectic following the model already set by nineteenth- and twentieth-century esoteric compendia. She very likely derived the idea from Andreae’s The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz, a treatise often appearing in her writings. A spiritualized version of the alchemical marriage is also given by Garstin in Secret Fire, Ch. vii, n. p. where he mentions ‘the Mystical Marriage of the Philosophers’ as a sort of unity of oneself with his/her Divine Self. She was also acquainted with the significance of the marriage motif in Kabbalistic thought via Mathers’s The Kabbalah Un-veiled; see ibid., 35. Another book she owned and which had an impact on her spiritual understanding of the marriage motif is Regardie, The Garden of Pomegranates, 96, 140. Christian imagery also seems to have played a major role. Colquhoun discusses the idea of Christian mystics’ sense of mystical marriage with the Divine in a paper she delivered in the late 1930s; see typescript at tga 929/2/3/2.58 As Colquhoun notes, according to the colour scheme of the Golden Dawn’s Rose of Twen-ty Petals, peacock blue and red-orange are considered as symbolic of the opposite zodia-cal signs Taurus and Scorpio; see Colquhoun, ‘The Zodiac and the Flashing Colours’, 5."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"377The Iconography of ‘Coniunctio Oppositorum’<UN>of the aforementioned colours.59 In light of the Golden Dawn instructions, this deliberate mixing of colours might also point to the function of this image: a medium to initiate a change in consciousness and enable meditation and self-awareness.60In Diagrams of Love: The Tree of Veins i (c. 1940–41) (Fig. 15.2), Colquhoun offers another visually non-gendered version of coniunctio oppositorum. The work shows a tree crowned with a red heart on top and growing blue heart-shaped roots at the bottom, a colour choice symbolic of the conjunction of 59 For instructions see Regardie, The Golden Dawn, 312, 479–482.

In her image, however, Colquhoun deviates from the instructions to use the appropriate colour for each sigil and its spectral opposite for the background. In order to attain the flashing effect, she rather ‘aim[s] for the maximum contrast in adjacent colour areas’; see Colquhoun, ‘Colour and the two Sigils,’ 9.60 The change of coloration through the juxtaposition and mixture of contrasting colours can be interpreted as an indication of the completed psychological process of the self; for a Jungian reading of the alchemical use of colours in art see Hale, ‘The Alchemy of Color’, 107–122.Figure 15.2Ithell Colquhoun, Diagrams of Love: The Tree of Veins i, c. 1940–41, watercolourTate Archive, London. © Samaritans, © Noise Abatement Society & © Spire Healthcare"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Ferentinou378<UN>polar opposites. Its branches also bear red hearts which are connected through golden rays with the uppermost heart. Colquhoun mingles the Kabbalistic tree of life with the alchemical tree of the philosophers.61 In her case, however, the roots of the tree are indicated in the form of a blue heart.62 Colquhoun’s em-phasis on the uppermost and lowest ends of the tree as a pair of opposites very likely reflects the hermetic dictum ‘As Above, so Below’ and the related Kabbalistic notion that ‘Malkuth is in Kether and Kether in Malkuth’ which she often compares in her writings.63 Her use of colours reinforces this inter-relation: blue for the chaos and the undifferentiated matter, red for the per-fected product of creation and yellow/gold for the creative principle that flows throughout the tree endowing the fruiting products with life.64 The work also reflects her borrowings from illustrations of the work of the Christian mystic Jacob Boehme. The frontispiece to the 1682 edition of Boehme’s On the Tes-taments of Christ (1623) provides a likely source (Fig. 15.3): in this image two hearts, an upright and a reversed, function as the media through which blood circulates into the entire tree/cross, thus linking the lower world of corrosive fire and the upper realm of divine light. The heart serves as the hermetic vessel in which the marriage of contraries takes place so that the cross of suffering could be transformed into the tree of eternal life.65 Colquhoun’s tree of veins may be read as a free adaptation of Boehme’s image, bringing together male and female, spiritual and corporeal, heaven and earth. The symbol of heart substantiates this reading; in the context of Colquhoun’s work it signifies love as the centripetal force that unites not only opposite sexes but also everything that exists.61 Her tree of hearts may be likened to the lunar or solar trees of the alchemists portrayed in hermetic treatises, such as Mylius’s Philosophia Reformata (1622); see Klossowski De Rola, The Golden Game, 175 fig. 328, 176 fig. 335.62 Colquhoun seems to have been inspired by the alchemical images of solar and lunar trees that bear six fruit on each side and one on the top, signifying the twelve-fold alchemi-cal process and its ultimate product. Her image also contains a fourteenth symbol at the bottom.63 See Colquhoun in Nichols, The Magical Writings of Ithell Colquhoun, 22, 30; Colquhoun, Sword of Wisdom, 274.64 It seems that she uses red and blue as emblematic of opposites but she follows Garstin’s colour diagram of Aurea Catena where the first “link” of chaos, painted in blue and gold, is juxtaposed with the last “link” of the quintessence, indicated in red and gold; see her ‘Notes on the Colouring of the “Homer’s Golden Chain Diagram”’, 16. The amber back-ground again creates a flashing effect.65 The image is much more complex and merits closer analysis that is beyond the scope of this essay.

The egg is one of the oldest images involved in Creation myths.66 In alchemy it appears as a symbol of both the vessel within which transmuta-tion takes place as well as the ultimate product of the process.67 Colquhoun engages phallic and vaginal imagery to allude to the collaboration of male and female generative principles to create a new androgynous being, embodied this time in the images of the speckled egg and nascent bird. Following typical alchemical imagery (see for example Fig. 15.5), she uses the egg as an emblem of the union of opposites and the bird as a symbol of their product, the so-called bird of Hermes.68 Colquhoun occasionally weaves together androgyny with egg and bird symbolism, implying the interconnection of these motifs in her artistic vocabulary. In this work, to stress their affinity, she portrays a bird with a genderless human face and a spherical body, thus pointing to the inte-grated nature of the newly-born being. Interestingly, her androgynous egg/bird with the colourful dotted speckles also recalls the imagery of the peacock’s tail, which for some alchemical treatises integrates all colours, thus symbolis-ing the end product of the opus.69 Colquhoun seems to depart from typical alchemical colour attributions, by using, for example, red for both vaginal and 66 It was particularly connected with birth and the mystery of life and, hence, it was highly appreciated by several ancient cultures, and used in rituals related to afterlife and the cult of the dead; see for example Stookey, Thematic Guide to World Mythology, 33–37.67 On the alchemical symbolism of the egg, see Shephard, ‘Egg Symbolism in Alchemy’, 140–148. Colquhoun was aware of the alchemical import of the egg via primary sources such as Andreae’s The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz and secondary sources such as Silberer, Problems of Mysticism and its Symbolism, 91, 98, 103, 315, 324 and Jung, Psychology and Alchemy, 201–202.68 Colquhoun uses the term ‘Bird of Hermes’ as a title to a play she wrote in the 1920s as well as in the epigraph of her later novel Goose of Hermogenes. For drafts of the play see tga 929/2/1/5 and tga 929/2/1/52. Her source is Philalethes, ‘Metamorphosis of Metals’, 243. Another likely source is the homonymous “hermetic” poem included in Elias Ashmole’s collection Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum (1652), 213–226.69 Heinrich Khunrath in Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae (1595; 1609) reserves a sig-nificant role for the peacock in the context of his “chemical” Christianity. Identified by an inscription as the bird of Hermes, the bird is depicted rising from the head of the hermaphroditic rebis and signifies the quintessence; see Klossowski De Rola, The Golden Game, 29–30, 40, 44. Atwood interprets the appearance of the peacock’s tail as a ‘token’ of the ‘supersentient’ fusion of opposites that ‘is made apparent in the Microcosmic Heaven’ and which brings forth ‘the beautiful idea of the Harmony’; see Atwood, Suggestive In-quiry, 353–354. Colquhoun seems to have integrated elements from the two sources to formulate her own androgynous bird as a symbol of the integrated individual, what Jung equates with anthropos or filius regius; see Jung, Mysterium Coniunctionis, 290–291."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Ferentinou382<UN>phallic symbols, and appropriates colour symbolism eclectically to suit her ar-tistic purposes.

Drawing from the colour attributions of the four elements in the Golden Dawn scheme, she uses indigo/violet, yel-low, blue and red/orange, without clearly adopting their typical identification with the four elements – earth, air, water and fire respectively. For example the phallic form is blue, while the vulva-shaped is red/orange, reversing stan-dard colour associations. As the title suggests, however, the synthesis of the aforementioned colours and organic shapes connotes the reconciliation of all elements and the subsequent creation of a whole being. A blue aura emanates from the biomorphic figure, perhaps suggesting its spiritual nature in accor-dance with theosophical teachings on the colour classification of “cloud-like ovoids” encompassing all living beings.73These are some of the most representative pictorial works Colquhoun creat-ed in the 1940s to illustrate coniunctio oppositorum. As has been demonstrated so far, her images touch upon the essential mating of contraries but surpass strictly sexual or gendered variations. Even when sexual imagery is appropriat-ed, she does not celebrate carnal sexuality but a form of sexualised spirituality that links sexual love with spiritual power and transformation, drawing selec-tively on Asian traditions like Taoism and Indian Tantra and the latter’s appro-priation by occultist groups of her time, such as the Ordo Templi Orientis.74 It is not therefore accidental that in her writings she often likens alchemical conjunction with the geometric Yin-Yang diagram of Taoism and describes 71 Colquhoun, Sword of Wisdom, 261.72 Regardie, The Golden Dawn, 95, 241.73 A blue-coloured aura connotes a spiritual being. Likely sources may have been Lead-beater, Man Visible and Invisible (1902) or Besant and Leadbeater, Thought-Forms (1901). Although there is no solid evidence that she had read the books, her writings show her ac-quaintance with Leadbeater’s account of the colour appearance of the Chakras. It is also almost certain that she was aware of the theosophical theories of the “etheric double” and its bluish colour through Besant, The Ancient Wisdom, whose 1922 edition is found in her private book collection.

As her notebooks from the 1920s and 1930s demonstrate, she was studying Sanskrit texts of Yoga, such as Shiva Samhita,76 whose objective is de-fined in her own words as the manifestation of ‘the androgynous nature of the developed human being, by sexual intercourses on all planes between the self and the very small and subtle flame whose form is intelligence’.77 Colquhoun acquired books on Yoga, explored yogic practices and amassed material on both Yoga and Tantra particularly in the 1950s and 1960s.78 In 1975, in the bi-ography she wrote for Mathers, she focused on Tantra and discussed its likely employment by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, elucidating her con-ception of the tantric tradition.79Grounding her line of thought on Oswald Spengler’s The Decline of the West (1918, 1922), Colquhoun suggests that ‘Tantra in art, philosophy, feeling, repre-sents the Magian Strain in Oriental culture’,80 a strand equally distinguished from both the classical and romantic modes of Western thought. She doubts whether ‘one can find Tantra properly so called in Europe unless as an impor-tation from the East’, and she points out that there is a distortion of original tantric teachings in the West since there is an emphasis on ‘one of Tantra’s “Five M’s” – Maithuma, sex-intercourse – at the expense of its other four’.81 Colquhoun clearly does not dismiss the sex-act itself, but underlines the spiri-tual dimension of the sexual union of opposites. As we have seen so far, this is manifest in her work. In contrast with her artistic peers who placed more 75 Colquhoun, Sword of Wisdom, 273, 274, 284.76 Shiva Samhita is one of the most famous treatises on Hatha Yoga. Its date of production is not definite but ranges from the 15th to the 17th centuries. The text is addressed by Shiva to his consort Parvati and combines yogic and tantric doctrines; see Mallinson, The Shiva Samhita, ix. Colquhoun preferred the spelling Shiva Sanhita, perhaps following Crowley’s paradigm.77 See Colquhoun’s notebook at tga 929/5/35/3.78 Her library contains book titles such as Patanjali, Aphorisms of Yoga (1938) and Yesudi-an and Haich, Yoga and Health (1955).

The story revolves around the ordeals of an un-named heroine who visits her uncle on a desolate island, only to discover that he is an alchemist versed in witchcraft and obscure experiments, and she is imprisoned in his mansion because of her precious jewels of alchemical pow-ers. Organized according to the twelve-stage subdivision of the alchemical opus, the heroine’s journey parallels the alchemists’ quest for the philosophers’ stone.83 In the course of the novel she is compelled to explore not only her uncle’s land and its secret life, but also her own psyche and potentials through dreams, visions and inexplicable events until her escape in the “projection” chapter. As has been discussed elsewhere, the story may be read as an allegori-cal account of the attainment of self-consciousness and “psychic androgyny” and casts light upon Colquhoun’s lifelong pursuit of personal transformation and spirituality as integral to woman’s emancipation.84This novel is significant for our discussion because it illustrates Colquhoun’s revision of coniunctio oppositorum, significantly informed by her blend of esotericism and psychology in the 1940s and early to mid-1950s. Most specifi-cally, it reflects Colquhoun’s interpretation of alchemy primarily as a spiritual practice and as psychology. Her understanding of alchemical transmutation mainly as a psycho-spiritual process permeates her fiction but it would be also attested to in later writings. For example, in 1968 she notes that ‘alchemy may be many things ... [but] ... often takes the form of psychology or metaphysics ...’, further acknowledging the role of Silberer and particularly Jung toward this development;85 and in 1975 she would admit: ‘Metallic transmutation ... is no more than a token of the Sage’s profounder knowledge and wider powers’.86Colquhoun’s book acquisitions suggest her familiarity with psychological theories since the 1940s. For example, in 1945 she obtained a copy of The Middle 82 See footnote 49.83 The number of the stages of the alchemical process recalls the subdivision of Twelve Gates by the English alchemist Sir George Ripley, but Colquhoun herself reveals her reli-ance upon Basil Valentine’s Twelve Keys; see Sword of Wisdom, 282.84 This interpretation was first propounded and elaborated at length in Ferentinou, Women Surrealists and Hermetic Imagery, Chapter 5; see also Ferentinou, ‘Ithell Colquhoun, Sur-realism and the Occult’, 14–16.85 See ‘Surrealism and Hermetic Poetry’, 3–5 at tga 929/2/1/60.86 Colquhoun, Sword of Wisdom, 284."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"387The Iconography of ‘Coniunctio Oppositorum’<UN>Pillar (1938) written by the former secretary of Aleister Crowley, populariser of occultism and lay analyst Israel Regardie. This work introduced a psychologi-cal perspective on occultism and is seminal for understanding Colquhoun’s own adaptation of psychology.87 Regardie expounded how practical exercises drawn from ceremonial magic are associated with the techniques and theories of analytical psychology,88 in other words he brought magic and psychology together. He believed that magic and psychology shared the same object of study, the human mind, and actually strove toward similar ends, for example the well-being of the individual and especially the achievement of balance and equilibrium within the self. He further paralleled analytical psychology with the ancient wisdom, especially of the East, that ‘had evolved a highly com-plex and elaborate scheme not only of analysis, but also of spiritual develop-ment and synthesis’.89 Welding together psychology and occultism, Western and Eastern, Regardie equated the Jungian notion of individuation with the esoteric principle of awareness of one’s higher self, in other words of the ex-istence of the divinity within oneself, echoing the Golden Dawn’s highest self, the theosophical “God within us” and Yoga’s “spiritual” raising of the individual to a divine state.Colquhoun was fond of Regardie’s books and was very likely influenced by his double interest in occultism and psychology.90 His advice that the esoter-ic adept should first sit on the couch of a psychotherapist must have struck a chord with Colquhoun, and in the early 1950s she underwent psychother-apy with the Jungian psychiatrist Alice E. Buck. It was at this time that she explored Jungian theories more systematically and appreciated their signifi-cance for inner transformation. Unfortunate events in her personal life, such as her divorce from del Renzio in 1947 and her marginalisation within surreal-ism by the leading members of the English surrealist group throughout the 1940s, perhaps awakened her interest in analytical psychology as a means of self-exploration and personal fulfilment. Colquhoun corresponded with Buck, narrating her dreams in letters when they could not meet. Buck interpreted her dreams in the light of analytical psychology, bringing within the horizon 87 It is not coincidental that her library contains two copies of the book, the first published in 1945, the other reprinted in 1970.88 As Regardie himself explains, he uses the term “analytical psychology” to include the work not only of Jung but also of Freud and Adler; see Regardie, The Middle Pillar, 4.89 Ibid.90 She owned copies of several books by Regardie of which the most notable, according to her ‘list of my best ten books’, was The Golden Dawn (1937–1940); see Ratcliffe, Ithell Colquhoun, 306."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Ferentinou388<UN>of Colquhoun’s consciousness her unconscious fears, anxieties and emotional entanglements.91 From their correspondence we also learn that Colquhoun was interested in archetypal images of the integrated self, like that of the yan-tra, and sought for inner wholeness through the reconciliation of her anima and animus, the opposite qualities of the psyche according to Jung.92Colquhoun’s accumulative knowledge of diverse spiritual systems, Western and Eastern, and her interest in self-realization and spiritual empowerment are best elaborated in Goose of Hermogenes. The book is the culmination of her search for a synthesis of polarities and mirrors her evolving attitude toward co-niunctio oppositorum in the 1950s. The narrative of the novel is replete with al-chemical images that allude to the correspondences between the material and immaterial planes, the concept of transmutation and the relationship of the self with the cosmos.93 It also contains scenes connected to the interaction, opposition and/or reconciliation of male and female sexes: a fictional union of lovers (conjunction); the heroine’s nightmarish decomposition and fusion with an unknown male in the graveyard (putrefaction); her fantasized erotic union with her beloved, Innocencio (congelation); her sisters’ possession by demonic beings (fermentation); her unwilling participation in a magical sex-act conducted by her alchemist uncle (exaltation); her quarrel with her half-brother and encounter with the ghostly figure of her dead father (projection).It is worth noting that the only consummated union of opposites involves the first couple which is paradigmatic of the “natural” blending of two indi-viduals, meant to complement each other, into a whole being. This paradigm, incorporated within a fairy-tale, may be read as an archetypal image of psy-chic wholeness that raises the heroine’s awareness of her latent potential for divine power, and inspires her embarking upon a spiritual journey to unite the conflicting halves of her self and regain her undivided integrated nature. 91 For her correspondence with Buck, her personal notes on Jungian analysis and Buck’s articles on psychology, see tga 929/1/235–252.92 See for example the letter at tga 929/1/237. The yantra, usually composed of geometrical shapes, is a physical form utilised in Buddhism and Hinduism as an instrument to aid meditation or to depict a deity. Mandala figures, circular images usually containing a qua-ternity in various forms, are found primarily in Eastern spirituality and used as yantras. Jung devoted several pages over the psychological significance of the mandala as a sym-bol of the emergence of the self after the confrontation with the unconscious; see Jung, Psychology and Alchemy, 95–223; see also Storr, The Essential Jung, 229–238. Colquhoun’s yantra may be seen as an equivalent of the mandala.93 These images include the garden of the philosophers, the elixir of life, the alchemical mestruum, the primal matter, chemical substances, such as mercury, sulphur and salt, Hermes’s caduceus, the archetypal feminine, the philosophers’ egg, the alchemical vessel, the androgyne/hermaphrodite and the bird of Hermes."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"389The Iconography of ‘Coniunctio Oppositorum’<UN> Within the context of the novel, this ideal coniunctio functions as an arche-type of unity and integration, an objective accomplished through the conjunc-tion of opposed forces within the self rather than the romantic search for a soul-mate.As I have argued elsewhere, the book shows Colquhoun’s shift from her myth of sexual, spiritual and social unity, the Siamese Twins, to that of Goose of Hermogenes as a model for psychic wholeness.94 Admittedly, in the 1940s her appropriation of the concept should be read within the surrealist discourse of desire and revolt but also in an esoteric context, which explain her emphasis on conjunction as a spiritualized paradigm of sexual union. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, it is her growing involvement with esotericism and analytical psychology that greatly informed her work. Her disillusionment with love as the means to reach completion and her struggle to gain self-sufficiency as a woman artist and occultist in the post-war, still largely patriarchal, world must have reinforced her decision to pursue occultism and analytical psychology as tools of spiritual discovery and growth.This line of thought, already in embryonic form in her earlier works, is un-covered not only in Goose of Hermogenes but also in other verbal statements dating from the early 1950s. For example, in 1953 she writes that ‘the division into male and female represents “a split in the psyche”. The task is to replace this unresolved duality by a genuinely androgynous whole, the fruitful relation of man and daimon, conjunctio’.95 Her pronouncement is significant because it explicitly configures the conjunction of opposites as a spiritual and psycho-logical ideal. Moreover, it reveals her debt to W.B. Yeats’s A Vision (1937)96 as well as to her alchemical, theosophical and Golden Dawn affiliations which shaped her idea of the ungendered and undivided self. It is meaningful that her pair of polarities is no longer envisioned anthropomorphically – a couple of lovers - but rather ontologically – the joining of the terrestrial and celestial manifestations of the human individual to become whole. Her rejection of separatism is also summed up in her response to a questionnaire about my-thology the same year: Colquhoun vehemently rejects dualism as the worst heresy because it separates the body from the mind and divides ‘the body itself 94 Ferentinou, ‘Ithell Colquhoun, Surrealism and the Occult’, 16.95 Colquhoun, ‘The Night Side of Nature’, unpaginated.96 Colquhoun admired the work of Yeats and recognized a kindred spirit in him, since he was also involved in both occultism and art. In her Sword of Wisdom, 296, she mentions his prose A Vision, a product of automatic writing, and also quotes a few lines that de-scribe the passionate love between daimons who seek union with each other to resolve their antinomies and reconstruct their own true nature. She also gave a talk on Yeats’s prose; see drafts at tga 929/2/3/3."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Ferentinou390<UN>into two parts, one above the waist and one below, rather than looking at it as a whole’.97Her employment of coniunctio oppositorum no doubt reveals her quest for self-knowledge, power and creativity beyond gender or other divisions. Colquhoun’s revision of the concept reveals a proto-feminist, in other words a political re-configuration of the concept as an avenue not only for female empowerment but also for healing the fragmented self. This reflects a holis-tic approach which, in her case, is not reactionary but reflects her interest in effecting an organic unity that could be projected onto culture and society as well. Colquhoun’s utopian vision could be therefore seen through the lens of what Petteri Pietikainen termed “psychological utopianism”, that is ‘a form of social dreaming’ in which inner transformation is deemed indispensable for the ensuing change in society or culture.98 This is therefore a shift of focus from her surrealistically-inspired vision of cultural transformation in the early 1940s to that of personal transformation toward the late 1940s. The intercon-nection of the personal and the collective, the secular and the sacred goes back to the feminist campaigns of theosophists at the turn of the century and Colquhoun seems to have been following this line of thought.99In the 1950s, Colquhoun’s art becomes more abstract, gradually filled with geometric and/or organic forms that allegedly give shape to a pantheistic world invisible to the uninitiated onlooker. It further documents her view of nature as a unified whole imbued with life, a belief she held since her youth.100 Colquhoun was less productive during these years, perhaps because she devot-ed significant amounts of time to her occultist pursuits and the writing of her travel books.101 It is noteworthy that with the exception of a couple of works that allude to the conjunction of opposites, such as Ikon I-Crucifixion (1951) and Crucifixion (1953), Colquhoun was no longer preoccupied with explicit images of love and the union of sexual opposites as in the early 1940s. Moreover, sever-al of her artworks are products of her experimentation with automatic meth-ods, which she believed bring forth the artist’s inner life, transforming art into a medium of psycho-spiritual inquiry.102 Self-exploration evidently became the driving force behind her artistic, esoteric and psychological researches.97 Colquhoun cited in Shillitoe, Ithell Colquhoun, 101.98 Pietikainen, Alchemists of Human Nature, 16.99 See Dixon, The Divine Feminine, passim.100 Colquhoun, Sword of Wisdom, 20.101 In the 1950s Colquhoun travelled to Ireland and Cornwall to write two travel books in which she incorporated her knowledge of esotericism as well as Celtic spirituality and mythology. See Colquhoun, The Crying of the Wind; Colquhoun, The Living Stones.102 See Colquhoun, ‘The Mantic Stain’, 15–21."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"391The Iconography of ‘Coniunctio Oppositorum’<UN>In the light of the above discussion, it can be argued that Colquhoun, welding together art, esotericism and psychology, resorted to coniunctio oppositorum and its visual and verbal images to evoke her belief in the unity of polarities on all planes. She was not however alone in modifying esoteric and psychological concepts to match her vision. Other contemporary artists wishing to escape binarism, such as the French surrealists, also turned to Western esotericism and psychoanalysis as potential sources of inspiration. Nourished by contem-poraneous esoteric ideas and cognizant of the modern spiritual/ psychologized interpretations of alchemy, Colquhoun formulated her own pictorial and verbal vocabulary in which coniunctio oppositorum plays a prominent part. Her iconography is wide-ranging encompassing the human, animal, vegetal, mineral and spiritual realms. Her images, verbal and pictorial, exemplify her eclectic appropriation and revision of the concept and interact harmoniously with each other. It is not coincidental that she often drew pictures to illustrate her books. Her paintings are often abstruse and difficult to decipher without the aid of her titles, annotations and insightful writings. Her verbal output sig-nificantly complements her visual work, pointing to a multitude of meanings which are not imposed on the reader/spectator but brought to light to suggest the belief in the existence of a multi-layered and largely unknowable reality that comprises both the self and the material world.In the late 1960s Colquhoun would write:... Jung suggests that we are nearing a moment in history when that inter-mediary realm – between matter and the psyche – with which alchemy is occupied ‘may come to life again, the physical and psychic be once more blended’. In the words of Hermes: ‘It is necessary that at the end of the world heaven and earth be bond together, this being the philosophical word’.103Colquhoun undoubtedly wished to erase boundaries and distinctions and es-tablish a new way of thinking in parallel with several occultists, psychologists and artists of her era. Her pursuit can be characterized as a quest for a “holistic utopia”. Adopting creatively symbols drawn from alchemy and analytical psy-chology, she offered an imagery that allowed for the articulation of a critique of non-egalitarian, sexist hegemonic ideologies and sought to reintegrate humankind with itself, nature and culture. Although she seems to relegate cer-tain of her images to the realm of metaphysics, her iconography does not posit the union of opposites as a timeless concept; it is rather seen as a polymor-phous and subversive idea that can be situated within the surrealist project ‘of 103 See ‘Surrealism and Hermetic Poetry’, 5 at tga 929/2/1/60."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Ferentinou392<UN>psychical revolt and the subversive re-enchantment of the world’,104 purport-ing to provide a fruitful, benevolent and egalitarian vision for the future, if not a viable solution to the malaise of Western modernity, in the post-war era.

The number of individuals and movements since the onset of the age of rationalism that have been influenced by angelic inspiration or commu-nication is impressive, whether or not proof of the facticity or support for the content of any of these epiphanies exists. One might say, using the phraseology of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, that for many becoming-angel remains possible and desirable, however tentatively.1 Angels continue to serve as politi-cal symbols in national monuments, government buildings, war memorials, as well as for anti-establishment activists. The internet is filled with angels as ide-als, mentors, or costumes linked to personal identity-formation. Angels make up a wide seam (and seme) in New Age art, Christian art, SciFi/Fantasy art – in many cases each subculture featuring readily identifiable styles of angels. Angels entail an online motíf where individuals post their attempts to express their visions, imaginings or bend visual reality. No small number of artists ap-pear to devote their skills only or mostly to angels. Clearly angels continue to be productive spiritually, culturally, even politically.The proliferation of angels in modernity of course appears to be surprising because of the widespread narrative that modernity equals secularization. Vari-ous explanations have been offered for this continued or renewed proliferation of angels, mostly focusing on believing Christians and/or New Age acolytes.2 My essay, in contrast, is about what I call modern angels, a term I will clarify below.3 Indeed, I will limit my discussion even further, to treat – through but three examples – angels produced by self-proclaimed “revolutionary” artists or artists connected with avant-garde movements from the late 18th through the 1 Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Ch. 10: ‘1730: Becoming-Intense, Becoming- Animal, Becoming-Imperceptible.’2 For instance: Wuthnow, After Heaven, Ch. 5 (“Angel Awakenings”), 114–141; Clark, ‘Where Have All the Angels Gone?’; Crites, ‘Angels We Have Heard’; Bloom, Fallen Angels (2007), and Omens of the Millennium (1997).3 This paper derives from a larger book project, tentatively entitled Modern Angels.

While my larger project makes various claims regarding modern angels, here I focus on modern angels’ links to esotericism. Due to the staggering volume of writing, film and television that depicts angels, I am here limiting myself to the static visual arts, though I refer here and there to other media. Surprisingly, given the parallel proliferation of books about angels, little serious analysis has appeared.5A few preliminary observations can be made easily. Around the time of the Enlightenment, roughly, modern angels stepped out of their traditional reli-gious narratives and iconography, entering more profane spheres where they were now needed. In one sense, there is little new with modern angels; angels from the beginning (of their being depicted) manifested some sense of the embodiment of their times – that’s how it has been possible to make them vis-ible. Harold Bloom argues that ‘all angels, by now, necessarily are fallen angels,’ without their being demons or devils.6 While there is truth in this, it ignores what I consider the more interesting parts of the story. DefinitionsPerhaps the first question to be asked is whether angelology comprises an exoteric or esoteric discourse. Traditionally, angelology might be said to be divided between exoteric and esoteric based on things like the use made of angels, the form, directionality and content of communication, and the intent and location of the individual in relation to a particular community and/or 4 Bürger, Theory of the Avant-Garde, limits the label avant-garde to certain movements of the early 20th century – dadaism, futurism, surrealism, and leftist avant-gardes of the 1920s – which alone critiqued/attacked art as an institution. While sympathetic to Bürger’s more pur-ist definition, I use a looser meaning of avant-garde because most modernist artists adopted various avant-garde strategies and/or stances, even if they did not seek to destroy or under-mine art as a bourgeois institution.5 Some exceptions exist: Singletary, ‘Jacob Wrestling with the Angel’; Piglia-Veronese, ‘The Pleasure of Suspension’, who treats the angels of Odilon Redon; Jiménez, El ángel caído. Also Aivalioti, ‘The Greek Symbolism’. The following came to my notice too late for consideration: Paul Klee: The Angels; Ben-Meir, Dialectics of Redemption: Anselm Kiefer’s The Angel of History.6 Bloom, Fallen Angels, 24."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"399Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>orthodoxy.7 Eventually Catholic dogma and canon law effectively declared the intentional invocation of angels to be esoteric and dangerous, though unof-ficial or mystical trends of course continued. ( Judaism generally featured a similar division.) Protestantism originally followed suit but quickly various individuals and groups evinced great interest in angelic communications. Unsolicited visions of angels straddled the border of permissibility and their placement generally depended on how some of the above criteria were an-swered, i.e., the distinction was almost inevitably theopolitical. It should be kept in mind that until quite late Catholicism, on the one hand, and the aca-demic art institutions, on the other, both attempted to regulate even the visual depiction of angels.In modernity angels have moved into entirely new realms, taken on new forms. The place and meanings of esotericism also have changed. It could be said that, insofar as all “actual” angels – as opposed to figurative or discursive angels – are metaphysical, rationalist modernity declares them to be esoteric (and impossible). The innumerable angels manifesting in “high,” “popular” and commercial arts, abounding in virtual reality, popping up all over mass media, for the most part seem quite exoteric, a relatively routine component of mod-ern spirituality or a reflexive evocation of the West’s artistic heritage. Nonethe-less, when keeping in mind loose definitions of esotericism, it becomes readily apparent that many angels produced in the last two or so centuries, both mod-ern and “traditional” are produced out of a matrix of esoteric thought.When it comes to “high” and avant-garde art, categorization remains fraught. Much of modern art is itself esoteric in the general sense that its meanings and purpose remain intentionally concealed from “uninitiated” viewers. Many modern artists understand themselves to be offering religious, spiritual and/or gnoseological revelation(s) to viewers, though not always in ways as di-rectly apparent as in straightforwardly “religious” art. Since the 19th century commercial and popular arts have borrowed much from “high” art, and vice versa, to the point that in some ways a distinction between these realms can no longer be maintained. Resolution of the esotericism/exotericism question in part can be obtained by glancing at the history of angels in modern visual arts, which would take me too far afield, however; at the essay’s end I will offer some thoughts.Using the works of three artists as examples – William Degouve de Nuncques, Grisha Bruskin and Stephan Doitschinoff – I will explore some of 7 I am making many sweeping generalizations that require much more qualification than can be given here. Readers are begged to forgive my curtness regarding these knotty terminologi-cal and historical matters."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Schorsch400<UN>the ways in which avant-garde visual artists drew on and updated the esoteric archive. I have intentionally eschewed discussion of overtly esotericist artists and their angels, being more interested here in the way the angelic continues to seep beyond spiritual-religious domains. My examples are quite selective; I make no pretensions to a systematic recitation. Furthermore, in light of the vast terrain before us and the voluminous literature on modern art and artists I can offer here only the most selective and pertinent analysis even of the few cases that I discuss. Each of my choices achieves its “effect” (Roland Barthes on the “punctum” of works of art) through unsettling, riveting qualities that entail a good part of its “power” and help explain the modern artists’ attraction to angels as a trope. Esoteric AtmospheresThe exit of esotericism and the occult from under the wings of official religion over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries did not neglect the fields of art. Quite the contrary. Some of the era’s best-known aesthetic movements – the Pre-Raphaelites, symbolism, surrealism, abstract art – absorbed themes, aes-thetic motífs or philosophies originating in Christian mysticism, theosophy, kabbalah, spiritualism, occult magic, or the like. In many cases, individual art-ists themselves dabbled in or seriously explored these traditions. Each of these artistic movements saw itself as revolutionary.Over and over members of these movements expressed theopolitical goals. Renato Poggioli notes the usage by various avant-garde movements of quasi-religious terminology and structures for their own (self-)presentation: creating “myths” about their own style and goals (such as “art for art’s sake”), titling themselves “coteries, chapelles, or cenacles,” seeing in their leaders ‘not so much masters or heads of schools [but] priests of the modern religion of ’ art, functioning essentially like “sects” following and promoting ‘hierarchical and esoteric concepts in art [...] aesthetic initiation which is simultaneously a mys-tical initiation.’8 In accord with the modern personalization of spirituality, the symbolists, according to one early self-definition, proclaimed themselves ‘tired of the quotidian, the near-at-hand, the contemporaneous; we want to set the development of the symbol in any period, and even in outright dreams [...] the 8 Poggioli, The Theory of the Avant-Garde, 20–21. So, for one instance among many, the editor of the English edition of Jean Delville’s New Mission of Art praises Gustave Moreau for having ‘regarded his duties as a professor in the “Ecole des Beaux Arts” as a real apostleship’ (The New Mission of Art, 46)."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"401Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>essential aim of our art is to objectify the subjective.’9 Some, but hardly most of these artists cared for orthodox religion. Edward Burne-Jones once remarked, ‘Belong to the Church of England? Put your head in a bag!’10The aesthetic-spiritual-political aspirations of such avant-gardes certainly arise in regard to angels. Burne-Jones told Oscar Wilde that ‘the more mate-rialistic science becomes, the more angels shall I paint.’11 Here angels serve as a weapon of resistance, their depiction an act of blasphemy against the sci-entific dogma that declares metaphysics and soul non-existent. Easily could one list the numerous transitional angels of the late 19th century and early 20th century taken from Christian tradition, often still functioning within it, but with stylistic novelty and hence varying degrees of theopolitical revision-ism, produced by innumerable artists from east to west. Comparably popular were various allegorical angels, removed from directly and explicitly Christian contexts, conjured up by avant-garde artists, particularly symbolists. No less fascinating are the modern angels that recur in mysterious settings, neither christological nor “inspiring,” whose esoteric meaning remains oblique rather than genealogical, and whose aesthetic innovativeness yielded new approach-es to the still-resonant power of the angelic. Even sticking to the high mod-ernist angels connected directly to esoteric traditions provides more examples than can be treated here. I will discuss only one.William Degouve de Nuncques (1867–1935), a mostly self-taught neo- impressionist painter who favored intimate, dream-like rural and urban landscapes and night-time scenes, was born in France and grew up mostly in Belgium. In the late 1880s he began moving in symbolist literary circles and later joined Les xx, a group of forward-looking Belgian artists and artisans whose wide-ranging exhibitions influenced even Paris. His influences included Poe and Fernand Khnopff, both fascinated by the strange. Angels of the Night, 1894 (Fig. 16.1), became one of Degouve de Nuncques’ best known works. Like many of his paintings, it was set in a park, havens of cultivated nature. It should be recalled that despite the existence of princely or patrician urban parks or gardens since the seventeenth century, parks open to the public and run by municipal authorities were a nineteenth-century innovation, among other things an attempt to defuse the tensions of city life, industrial labor and office work among the working classes. For neo-Romantics and romantics “Nature” 9 Gustave Kahn, trans. in Underwood, ‘Watts and Symbolist Art in the Nineteenth Century’, 29.10 MacCarthy, ‘Wings of Desire,’ The Guardian, 23 December 2006.11 Quoted in Graham, Angels: God’s Secret Agents, ix. That Graham cites Burne-Jones as his first salvo against those who deny the spiritual realms shows what strange bedfellows counter-Enlightenment discourse can produce."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Schorsch402<UN>became thereby a space readily at hand for alternative modalities. As did so many artists of the time, in the first decades of the 20th century the Anda-lusian poet Juan Ramón Jiménez paid homage to the evening mysticism of parks: ‘through the parks/everything was out of a dream/light of stars, wings of angels.’12 In the left half of the silent, poetic Angels of the Night sky stars twinkle, while in the right a bright moon beams through the clouds. Degouve de Nuncques held that for such settings one required mostly color and emo-tion.13 What was being depicted was the introspective, even melancholy state of the viewing soul as much as any objective landscape. It is readily apparent that, as with so many 18th- and 19th-century artists, neo-classicists and avant 12 Quoted in Jiménez, El ángel caído, 48, among other pertinent verses. Edgard Maxence, The Initiation, 1890, offers a mysterious portrait of a woman wavering on a path leading into a woody park expanse, while Moreau’s The Park and the Angel of Death, ca. 1890, col-ors this theme with more explicit darkness.13 Quoted in Draguet, Le Symbolisme en Belgique, 88.Figure 16.1 William Degouve de Nuncques, Angels of the Night (1894)Collection Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, The Netherlands"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"403Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>garde alike, Degouve de Nuncques’s angels here are allegorical, even if the al-legory remains somewhat opaque.Given critical opinion of Degouve de Nuncques as a literary painter, no one seems to have noticed that this scene presents more than a mere dreamy noc-turne. Two spectral couples float over the footpaths in a park, disproportion-ately larger than the stylized trees amid which they romance. We seem to have two female angels with their male consorts, meeting and kissing at night, a simultaneous reversal of Gen. 6:1–3 and symbolist twist on the expression “an-gels of the night,” a euphemism for prostitutes: a wistful, perhaps adolescent male fantasy in place of the usually more sordid reality.Degouve de Nuncques imbued this portrait of strange trysts with more than immediately meets the eye. In the second couple the wings clearly belong to the female angel. The first couple is depicted in such a way as to make the owner of the wings less clear. Neither male’s legs can be seen; they seem to float along with their partners. The girl kneeling on the ground – an offspring of such in-terspecies coupling? – also bears wings. The girl assembles or disassembles a wreath of flowers. The two couples may allude to the female and male halves of the first iteration of the creation of Adam and Eve in Genesis or in Plato’s paral-lel myth of the original human configuration, both myths later proffered in the 16th-century Dialogues of Love of philosopher Leone Ebreo. One of the ancient Upanishad texts, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (ca. 1400 to 800 bce), also of-fers a bi-gendered first human, ‘he was the size of a man and woman in close embrace. He split this Self in two: and from this arose husband and wife.’ Then, however, the wife leaves, transforming herself into the female form of other animals. The husband pursues, also in the form of each species. Each time they have sexual relations in the form of one species, they give birth to the first of that kind.14 Other plausible visual sources include the two-headed angel from Solomon Trismosin’s book of alchemical parables, Splendor solis (16th cen.), plate 9, illustrating the 5th parable, or the more elaborated sequence of illus-trations of alchemical transmutation – a king and queen, sometimes winged, merging into the ideal hermaphrodite, out of which emerges the risen Christ the son – in the Rosarium philosophorum, which first appeared in Frankfurt in 1550.15 It is not clear to me whether Degouve de Nuncques has any of these an-cient references in mind. In none of these narratives are winged beings men-tioned. Perhaps he is simply drawing on elements of mythological fragments known to him, constructing them into a private myth of his own.14 Goodall (ed.), Hindu Scriptures, 48.15 The images are reproduced and discussed by Voss, ‘Spiritual Alchemy’, 164–168."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Schorsch404<UN>Even if the two couples comprise four different beings, the composition sug-gests a narrative sequence. The young angel in the lower right of the painting kneels at a circular, flowered mound, weaving or unweaving a wreath. Degouve de Nuncques may be presenting the hieros gamos, the sacred marriage of cos-mic forces known to ancient mythologies and alchemy. The child (the alchemi-cal “child of the work”?) seems to be mourning, the round forms hinting at the circle of life and death. She might be mourning the commingling of the transcendent and the transitory. Does her wreath celebrate wedding or death?Compositionally, the footpath structures an implicit narrative unfolding in a serpentine line toward the viewer:1. An angel both male and female.2. The halves individuate and kiss, that is, reunite.3. A child is born.4. Death.Birth and death intertwine. Individuation causes separation and growth and collapse back into the all, only to begin again. The helix suggests the neces-sity of death for life. Angels of night, that is, figurations of the life that comes through, and only through the mixing of the dark with the light: materiality, proliferation, individuation, transformation.16 The mixed couplings of Genesis 6 – heaven and earth, spirit and matter – led god in the next verse to fix a mortal limit to human life. The circle of life exudes a troubling supplement: pain and suffering. The circular wreath of the girl stands noticeably incomplete. Rilke’s “First Elegy”: ‘Who is immune to the night, to Night,/ever-subtle, deceiving? [...] Is she gentler to lovers? Oh, but they only/use one another as cover, to hide what awaits them.’17 The esoteric sources of Degouve de Nunques’ vision here would be apparent only to knowledgeable viewers. It remains unclear whether the painter himself intentionally cited esoteric ideas or even knew of them.In later years the artist turned frequently to overtly religious scenes, even before the depression spawned by the 1919 death of his beloved wife. In 1912 he participated in an exhibition of religious art in Brussels, while the next year he produced a series of sketches on canvas for the small Catholic church in the Belgish village of Xhignesse. These sketches depicted traditional episodes from the life of Jesus and many featured angels. Intriguingly, Angels of the Night 16 José Jiménez notes that Juan Ramón identifies angels with children, but in particular with the death of children (Ángel caído, 51), a perception that developed in early modern Catholicism.17 Rilke, Duino Elegies, 21."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"405Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>comprises one of the few symbolist paintings by Degouve de Nuncques that makes a human figure so central, even if here the angelic figures only stand in for the human, point to the trajectory of the human amid an enchanted yet earthly landscape. Overflowing the bounds of rigid allegory and a unitary meaning, certainly eschewing any explicit religious message, Degouve de Nuncques situates in the painting an evocation of ‘the troubling atmosphere of invisible worlds’ in which human life unfolds.18 Esotericism here is both at-mosphere and content, the latter hidden from those who do not recognize it. Beyond Everything, beyond NothingEsotericism continued to shape modern angels in the wake of the Second World War and the Holocaust. By the end of the 20th century, the art world had undergone tremendous change. Fine art and commercial art were no longer separated by institutional, social and attitudinal divides. As with my previous example, the esoteric connection to postmodernist angels often is quite indi-rect. Especially from the 1960s onward, however, esotericism became increas-ingly explicit. I will now treat two artists who openly invoke concrete esoteric traditions and motífs, to slightly different ends.Painter and sculptor Grisha Bruskin (b. 1945), born in the Soviet Union, has created a good number of angels. Jewish, much of his work resisted So-viet aesthetic and political norms by foregrounding overtly Jewish themes, an approach he discussed openly.19 His stance also fits into a larger context. Much Soviet art produced after Stalin’s demise and during and in the wake of Perestroika delved into the previously discouraged if not suppressed realm of religion and the occult. Many of Bruskin’s angels pertain to questions about Jewishness, though I will concentrate here on those with kabbalistic valences.20Several panels from Bruskin’s Alefbet (Alphabet) series feature angels, in-cluding nos. 4, 6 and 7, all executed in 1984. Each panel features eight variegat-ed Jewish “men” standing in two rows of four each. Each panel is rendered in a different color and around the figures, sometimes over them, hover extended 18 Ollinger-Zinque, ‘William Degouve de Nuncques’, 20, uses the phrase to describe his works in general.19 See, for instance, Bruskin, Past Imperfect, the first volume of his 3-volume memoirs in Russian; Bruskin Interview, in Soviet Dissident Artists, 313–322; Bruskin, ‘Two Themes,’ in Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 115–123.20 Bruskin notes his interest in kabbalah while still a young man (Bruskin, ‘Two Themes,’ in Ilf and Schneider, Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 115)."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Schorsch406<UN>quotations in Hebrew from the canonical ethical tract known in English as Eth-ics of the Fathers. Some of the words are crossed out, some are written in red. The standing figures are not always human and sometimes the men are accom-panied by or holding other kinds of beings: a lion, a woman. In Alefbet 4, for in-stance, one figure is replaced by a hanged man covered by a shroud, who hovers above the row, while another grasps a yellowish angel, seemingly female, also floating off of the ground. Alefbet 6 offers a six-winged angel, seemingly male, whose face is partly obscured by two of these appendages (perhaps a seraph described by some of the biblical prophets), while Alefbet 7 depicts a seemingly female six-winged angel in profile. All of these angels share the same yellow-ish hue, sharp, almost propeller-like wings, and a spectral emotional deadness. The panels of the very similar series Alefbet-Lexicon, nos. 1–5 (Fig. 16.2), from 1987 and 1988, multiply the numbers and effects. Among a plethora of floating or held objects and symbols, some clearly relating to Jewish life – matzah, an etrog (citron used for the holiday of sukkot or Tabernacles), a Hebrew letter, a ladder, detached angel wings – giant floating hands hold a figure’s hair or replace a face, some men hold up lions, one man bears a dog’s head, another has an owl sitting atop his own. Numerous angels appear, in various colors, of both genders, some depicted falling upside down, some holding up one an-other, one pouring out a liquid from a vessel, another blowing a shofar or ram’s horn, one carrying two crossed staffs. The lines of the figures are sharp, the coloration solid, yet a hallucinatory quality pervades the assemblage. Here the writing, even more mutilated, seems to derive from kabbalistic texts, but it is not clear whether from an actual single running source. The writing is esoteric in a double sense: (1) it derives from mystical texts from an esoteric tradition, a minority discourse within a minority’s discourse; (2) its meaning is impervious to those ignorant of Hebrew, non-Jews but even many Jews.These various creatures seem to represent some of the spirits, demons or inheritances with which Jews wrestle. Bruskin imbues the non-human fig-ures with palpable strangeness, even grotesqueness; they comprise a primi-tive residue from the past denigrated by scientific rationalism and socialist realism alike (the harsh Soviet denial and suppression of Judaism as a reli-gion must be kept in mind). These are not sweet, gentle angels. Intriguingly, these rows of beings bear a strong resemblance to Babylonian cylinder seals of protective and malevolent spirits from the 1st millennium bce, with which Bruskin may have been familiar (Fig. 16.3).21 Yet these are not merely external 21 See, for instance, Green, ‘Beneficent Spirits and Malevolent Demons’, figs. 11c, d. In truth, Bruskin’s rows of exempla resemble any of the many European illustrated ethnographies or encyclopedias that presented rows of different “primitive types” in their exotic hair-styles and outfits."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"407Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>entities.

Some men are marked as adam kadmon, the primordial Adam, a figure whom kabbalah knows as the original, superhuman and quasi-celestial form of the human; the metamorphoses we all share, undergo, if we are to stay alive. Though a viewer might not recognize the positive valence of these figures, writes Bruskin, ‘I provided each hero with an accessory.

His insistence on cross-species hybridity only grows over time, as is evident in the Message series, nos. 1 to 9, paintings from 1989–90 (Fig. 16.4 shows Message 8).Bruskin emigrated to the United States in 1988. Here the mystical writing – taken from the founder of the Lubavitch hasidic dynasty, Shneur Zalman of Lyady’s Likutei amarim (Collected Discourses) – makes up the background, now white, emptied even of color and substance.23 The words are even more 22 Bruskin, ‘Two Themes’, in Ilf and Schneider, Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 117.23 Bruskin identifies the text in a short commentary to a series of porcelain plates made from the images, Alefbet, 1999; ‘Lines Break Open Like Necklace Threads,’ in Ilf and Schneider, Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 218.Figure 16.3 Goddess, suppliant goddess, priest, and worshiper carrying kid before sun God with goddess and goat behind, Mesopotamia, First Dynasty of Babylon (ca. 1894–1595 bce), Pierport Morgan Library, Morgan Seal no. 399The Pierpont Morgan Library, New York"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"409Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>deconstructed, lacking continuity, coherence.

Bruskin writes that ‘The characters do not relate to each other; they are simply present, unified solely by context,’ absorbed only in God.26 The artist, alienated from his own heritage, had to invent these heroes, based on what he had learned in books about ritual objects or hasidic dress. Bruskin’s charac-ters thus stand as satires and rectifications of the ‘Plaster Pioneers, athletes, and war heroes’ that ‘decorated all corners of the Russian landscape in the time of [his] childhood,’ the “pagan idols” of Soviet statist inspiration.27 Hence Bruskin’s characters resemble the row of stiff manikin-like figures, each taken over by carefully segregated patches of color in the manner of team uniforms, in Sportsmen, 1928–1932, by Kazimir Malevich, whose faceless suprematism Bruskin transfigures. The redemptive power of his art, and not only for himself, Bruskin expresses by means of kabbalistic metaphor: each ‘character plus his accessory – is a tiny fragment, a spark of Light (shekhina). The viewer, moving from one mythologem to the next and deciphering them, restores the shattered fragments of the vessels (kelim) and recovers the content of the painting.’28 24 Ibid., 218. The extent and accuracy of Bruskin’s knowledge of kabbalah is unclear. He re-lates an incident from the 1990s, while living in New York, in which a friend asked him for a book on kabbalah and Bruskin gave him Philip Berg’s Introduction to Kabbalah (Bruskin, Past Imperfect, 321). Berg, founder of The Kabbalah Center, had studied with the well-known commentator on the Zohar, Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. Most experts would not con-sider Berg a reliable guide, but I am not sure whether Bruskin chose this book because it was accessible to beginners or because he valued its interpretation.25 Bruskin, ‘Lines Break Open Like Necklace Threads,’ in Ilf and Schneider, Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 218. Evincing the bricolage of cultural inheritance, Bruskin writes that the theme of Jacob wrestling with the angel appeared in his work “because of Rilke” (Bruskin, Past Imperfect, 92).26 Bruskin, ‘Two Themes,’ in Ilf and Schneider, Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 116–117.27 Bruskin, ‘Two Themes,’ in Ilf and Schneider, Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 122; Grisha Bruskin Interview, Baigell and Baigell, Soviet Dissident Artists, 316.28 Bruskin, ‘Two Themes,’ in Ilf and Schneider, Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 117."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"411Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>Hence his reference to these paintings as “magic texts.”29 The act of putting to-gether meaning(s) from works of art comprises a modern form of tikkun olam, repairing the fragmented world. It is not surprising that while still living in the Soviet Union Bruskin loved making ‘drawings of fairy tales for nursery schools,’ because of their lack of “ideological message,” but also, no doubt, because of their mythological separation from daily reality.30 It could be that Bruskin’s fondness for kabbalistic tropes bears a political meaning: “kabbalah” often served, in pre-Soviet Russia and in the glastnost-era Soviet Union, as a term of anti-Jewish invective under which all the ills of the governing regime were blamed on a Jewish conspiracy.31Parallels to the kaleidoscopic system of kabbalistic emanations surface even in Bruskin’s aesthetic self-presentation. Discussing his Lexicons series, he offers riddles: ‘A painting or a sum of paintings? A finished work or a fragment? Every part is completed, autonomous [...] Despite this, there arises the organic, indi-visible bond of multiplicity. If a traditional work of art has a compositional cen-ter [...] in this case there are as many centers as there are painting- fragments.’ In good esotericist fashion, he highlights the intended “absence of a beginning and an end.”32 Esotericism, via kabbalah, serves Bruskin both as an opposi-tional personal redemptive theopolitics and as an aesthetic method suited to combatting an oppressive Soviet political system built on scientific rationalism and perhaps even its more diffusely coercive, liberal rationalist western vari-ant. Even in this aesthetic-mystical theurgic schema, however, transcendence remains elusive. Bruskin identifies his people and their accessories as both “ideal meanings” and “a kingdom of banalities.”33My final example is Brazilian artist Stephan Doitschinoff (b. 1977), who makes frequent use of the rich and multivalent semiotics of alchemical visual imagery. Symbola Aureae is a drawing from 2006 (Fig. 16.5).The title, hovering near the central figure, an alchemical term, may refer more specifically to a 17th-century alchemical text by Michael Maier, Symbola aureae mensae duodecim nationum (The symbols of the golden table of the twelve nations/tribes, 1617). The winged woman, drawn much like a cartoon character, holds aloft a vial, on which sits a bird. Standing in a raging sea of stylized waves, her torso reveals a cutaway showing internal organs compris-ing a beaker with a skull inside it, its smoke or fumes soaring upward like a 29 Grisha Bruskin Interview, Baigell and Baigell, Soviet Dissident Artists, 317.30 Ibid., 313.31 Kornblatt, ‘Russian Religious Thought and the Jewish Kabbala,’ 91–93.32 Bruskin, ‘Two Themes,’ in Ilf and Schneider, Grisha Bruskin: Life is Everywhere, 122.33 Ibid., 123."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Schorsch412<UN>substitute throat. Doitschinoff may be playing with the image, beloved by Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz, of the black angel from the 15th-century illumi-nated alchemical manuscripts known as Aurora consurgens, who stands on the world while pulling open a view of her similarly unnatural innards. The winged woman looks away. Is she bored? Perhaps she is standing in the “mer-curial sea waters,” the primordial stuff from which everything in the universe was and is created – many alchemical images depict figures sitting, standing or lying in water, the water of life. Many alchemical texts use the figure of a beautiful female, whether queen or angel, to refer to matter which is capa-ble of transformation by means of (masculine) consciousness. Doitschinoff ’s figure looks like a corporate spokesperson holding up a miracle product. The vial likely is meant to contain the quintessence, the immortal fifth element, sought by alchemists. The angel’s torso cutaway is ringed by the words, LUSUS SERIUS QUO HERME SIVE MERCURIUS REX (SERIOUS PASSE-TIME, Figure 16.5 Stephan Doitschinoff, Symbola Aureae (2006)©Stephan Doitschinoff"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"413Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN> WHEREIN HERMES OR MERCURY IS DECLARED AND ESTABLISHED KING [of all worldly things]). This is the title of another work by Maier (1619) and my translation taken from the title of an English edition put out in the mid-17th century.34 As with many of his drawings, Doitschinoff has stained the work to look as if it had something spilled on it, to artificially age it. The free-floating letters round out the alchemical atmosphere, if they are meant to have significance at all. The V by the wings might stand for some permutation of the Latin (or Portuguese) volare, to fly. The na that seems to label the sea of waves is the chemical symbol for sodium (natrium in Latin), one of the elements ca-pable of forming salt, considered one of the three central substances in alche-my.35 In Portuguese, na is a contraction used to refer to feminine objects, and means “in her.”While drawing on alchemical sources in works such as Symbola Aureae, Doitschinoff seems to be resisting a coherent narrative or wholesale borrow-ing of meaning. Appropriately enough, he seems to be transmuting alchemical themes and symbology for the modern world. A speculative interpretation of this piece might go as follows: We humans, volatile like winged beings, are able to turn the chaos of the world into something valuable, salvific even, through the dissolution or killing off of the old form of things (the skull within the al-chemical beaker within the torso). The process, internal to ourselves, symbol-ized by the element mercury or Hermes/Mercury, the figure of transformation, is culminated by the union of opposites collected in the small vial, approved by the presence of the bird – often a dove, traditionally (here a pigeon suited to contemporary urban grittiness?) – symbolizing feminine sensuality. One rea-son Doitschinoff may have reproduced the title words of Maier’s alchemical text referring to the twelve nations is that the volume delineates the major contributions to alchemy made by twelve alchemists, each from a different nation. In other words, both Maier and Doitschinoff, in their respective ways, seek to offer a (relatively) non-parochial path to human betterment. This ori-entation may be bolstered by Doitschinoff ’s decision to make the alchemist in his depiction a woman. Indeed, instead of a corresponding significant mascu-line element we have only a (seemingly masculine) skull – perhaps the Hermes referred to via Maier’s title – the alchemist-angel has swallowed a phallic vial, 34 Lusus can also refer to an aberrant being, a freak.35 The anonymous Amor proximi (1686) explains that ‘the true medicine is thus the heart of Wisdom: out of this heart (or eternal spiritual salt) emerges life, as a spirit, fire, light air, and mist, which mist transforms itself into a water of life in the new birth; this Mist-Spirit-Water is Salt or Earth ... This is the true Ground of Nature’ (quoted in Versluis, Restoring Paradise, 61; he is translating from a.b.c. vom Stein der Weisen, ii:76)."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Schorsch414<UN>with which she appears singularly unimpressed (and on which the dove of femininity sits). The internalized Hermes also points to spiritual alchemy’s fo-cus on the personal transformation of the alchemist alongside – even instead of – his acts transforming the physical cosmos. Whether based on the ancient figure of Maria the Prophet known to the alchemical tradition or on alchemi-cal allegories such as the female angel, Doitschinoff ’s female alchemist chal-lenges the tradition’s general androcentrism.36 Perhaps he is poking fun at the pretensions of patriarchal systems to save the planet.In his Ad Astra, 2008 and Ad Astra, 2007 (Fig. 16.6), a monotone drawing and color painting, respectively, a skull-headed angel faces a woman named Niandra. I will discuss the color version. Two figures hold their comingled en-trails between them, on which rests a miniature church. The title begins to the left, shooting out of Niandra’s back, colorful rays of light, continuing on the far right behind the angel of death: AD ASTRA PER ASPER (To the stars 36 On Maria, see, for instance, Warlick, ‘Philosophic Mercury; Evolution of the Alchemical Feminine,’ 67–70.Figure 16.6 Doitschinoff, Ad Astra (2007)©Stephan Doitschinoff"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"415Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>through hardships), a permutation of the Latin saying that sums up the legend of Hercules.37 Out of her chest shoot other colorful rays that turn upward, sup-porting the word caput (head). The angel, all white, wears a cloak featuring an immense collar of clouds. Niandra’s large tangle of hair and the mass of exposed entrails both shine in garrish color, pinkish and purple, brighter than anything else depicted. The winged being might be the angel of death and/or an allusion to the alchemical principle of chaos, decomposition or death that must be assimilated/confronted by/within the alchemist. The meaning of the name Niandra remains a mystery. Andra is a girl’s name in Greek, meaning, in-triguingly, strong and courageous, a feminine version of andro, the Greek term for male or masculine. Andra thus connotes something like “manly,” while sig-nifying “woman.” Ni is the Latin term for “not.” Niandra thus might be read as a polyglot portmanteau word yielding something like “not manly,” while also meaning “not woman.” A perfect alchemical name.In this work, too, we see the alchemical union of opposites – male and female, death and life, material world and spiritual cosmos (the first terms, on the right, labeled “per asper,” the second, to the left, titled “ad astra”) – all necessary for the generation of the singular multiverse. The union as depict-ed both subverts and follows the allegorical sexual romance so beloved by alchemical texts, replacing, however, its usually more oblique contrarianism with a more explicitly grotesque and morbid disembowelment. Urszula Szula-kowska reads the violence and sexual transgressiveness of alchemical texts – personifications of elements murder each other, incest, etc. – as signs of the tradition’s operating as a site of heterotopic counter-cultural freedom.38 This kind of pre-modern saturnalian semiotics functions in Doitschinoff ’s work for exactly the same reasons, reacting as he is to the turbulent socio-economic realities of post-modern urban Brazil. Doitschinoff has said explicitly that the prominence of death in his works serves as a ‘metaphor for the world we live in, the chaos that reigns in the socio-political spectrum, all the environmental issues.’39 The church stands on the connective tissue of life-death/beauty-chaos, a frank, highly ambivalent (and esotericist?) characterization of institu-tional religion (‘But Love has pitched his mansion in / The place of excrement,’ wrote the esotericist Yeats in “Crazy Jane Talks with the Bishop”).Son of an evangelical minister who ran his church’s holiday camp with his wife and great-grandson and grandson of practicing spiritualist women, Doitschinoff works in a combination of styles, borrowing from street graffiti, 37 Kohler, Heaven and Hell in Comparative Religion, xiv.38 Szulakowska, Alchemy in Contemporary Art, 19–21.39 Manco, ‘Conversations [with Stephan Doitschinoff ]’, 77."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"Schorsch416<UN>murals, medieval woodcuts, psychedelia, Brazilian folk art, colonial decoration, cartoons, pop art, and Christian iconography. His strict religious upbringing and education inspired a critical rebellion, evident in his self-taught twist-ing of traditional religious symbols. He works under the pseudonym Calma (“Calm” or “Calm down” in Portuguese), which he parses as ‘the contraction of [the Latin] Con Alma / C’Alma,’ that is, “with soul.”40 Though at one point he was ‘studying huge books of religious art and iconography and visiting the Sacred Art Museum in São Paulo,’ as with so many modern angels, Doitchinoff emphasizes ‘the imagery outside of its theological narrative.’41 Doitschinoff has no love for the church, which he sees ‘as an archaic institution that always aimed to control the masses.’ It is, paradoxically, ‘an appropriate symbol for the corrupt modern institutions; like the big corporations, media channels and governments.’42 The “deep and rich” history and symbolism of sacred art strikes Doitschinoff as precisely the confluence of medieval and modern hegemony. ‘The fact that the symbols were rationally incorporated by the church and then assimilated by the masses shows the clever and heavy marketing used by the church since its beginning.’43Doitschinoff ’s re-application of religious symbology in the context of cri-tique of official religion entails an honorable esotericist stance. Typical, per-haps, of late 20th-century personal trajectories, hardcore punk rock led him to vegetarianism, which exposed him to Zen and Taoism, which introduced him to the work of Jung and investigation of mythology.44 The elements of Doitsch-inoff ’s art balance or battle one another; gloriously bright colors against inten-tional aging techniques, religious symbology against lusty pop art bodies, hope against death, seduction against revulsion. Reflecting the complex entangle-ment of religion and its critique or even mockery, Doitschinoff also produces faux (yet real) altarpieces as well as tombstones.If one stops believing in a certain god, does it disappear? Probably yes, but the necessity of filling that gap with another god, mythology or sim-ply a new concept, will be there.

He has painted murals in support of oppressed mineworkers and as a community service, spo-ken out against threats to local and minority cultures, painted the houses of the poor in rural towns and even revamped a run-down chapel that had ‘been taken over by the community; it had become a semi-pagan temple’ for Afro-Brazilian rites.46 One such mural on a house in Tomba Surrão, a permutation of some of the works I discussed above, offers a colorful angel of hope for the hardship-pressed locals (Fig. 16.7).A provocative gap hovers between the overtly democratic, socially respon-sible context of Doitschinoff ’s public work and the obscurantist mystery of most of his work’s content. While drawing on alchemy’s rich visual vocabulary, he has for the most part emptied out its referents, which would have been un-derstood by initiates, replacing alchemy’s traditional esotericism with a new kind. On one level, in good postmodernist fashion, Doitschinoff speaks to a viewing audience nearly entirely made up of those unable to penetrate the deep meaning of his works’ system, while still able to make general sense of it through familiar tropes and a shared Christian backdrop.

Pow-erfully, Doitschinoff ’s works work on both levels. And soI have chosen the above three examples due to the richness of their work and its significance for teasing out the uses of esotericism within modernist art. None of the above artists is an esotericist in the strict sense laid out by Antoine Faivre, though it is possible some of them believe(d) to one degree or another in some version of the idea of universal correspondences, living nature, the centrality of imagination and mediations, or the universal experience of trans-mutation.47 These artists represent, among many other artists, the degree to which strands of modern arts and esoteric knowledge and spirituality over-lap, with the caveat that, as post-Romantics, most locate ultimate value in this world and not in the invisible world(s) of religion-spirituality, though some be-lieve in what Gananath Obeyesekere calls “nontheistic or absolutist mysticism” or “a-theistic mysticism.”48 The works that I discuss certainly evince some form of Faivre’s four core esotericist notions.49 While I am generalizing greatly and do not want to collapse esotericists and avant-garde artists into a unitary phe-nomenon, it is clear they share important traits: an ambivalent or antagonis-tic relationship to the religious or artistic mainstream; being subject to active or passive marginalization; self-identification as enlightened, freed from il-lusion, heroic, bold, advanced, critical of “the masses” (self- marginalization); a strong drive toward radical stances, the use of shock, even scandal; cliquish, even insular language and gestures meant only for the initiated; also, often, paradoxically, orientation toward universal progress and democratic or anar-chistic politics (though sometimes toward the exact opposite); preference for personal experience (experiential gnosis) over tradition and scholasticism, yet a fascination with the ancient, archaic and exotic – a complex that in the 47 Faivre, ‘Renaissance Hermeticism and the Concept of Western Esotericism’; Faivre and Voss, ‘Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion’.48 Obeyesekere, The Awakened Ones, 144–145.49 The idea that works of art can offer perspectives that may not be shared, fully or always, by their makers I take from the thought-provoking recent work of Mitchell, What Do Pic-tures Want?"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"419Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>religious sphere has been labelled “antinomian spirituality.”50 Esoteric themes and visual symbols have appealed to avant-garde artists for many reasons, in-cluding their anti-rationalist suggestiveness, openness to polysemous mean-ings and simultaneous mysterious alterity but cultural familiarity.51It is relatively easy to explain the continuing appeal of angels for modern artists: the thick layers of accumulated intertextuality, the opportunity to re-shape a common trope, the plethora of resonances angels bear vis-à-vis some of the most persistent questions modern humans have regarding human na-ture and place. For avant-gardists, modern angels have become a singularly potent topos of simultaneous otherness and true essence, of disjunction from yet affection for the world, of harbingers of the future straight out of the past; a trope for the defiant hybridization of secularity and gnosis, of world-making and world-emptying, of world dis-enchantment and world re-enchantment.As I hope is clear from my three examples, modern angels evince the comin-gling of many previously separated categories. They appear as figures in mod-ern neo-gnostic universes, neo-pagan universes, both characterized by positive and willing comingling of otherwise dualistically segregated elements (purity vs. impurity, sacred vs. profane, transcendent vs. immanent, etc.). They exist alongside many other similar beings, invisible and/or imaginary. Though mod-ern angels cannot always be distinguished from “traditional” or “traditional-ist” angels, they comprise a reaction against modern official Western religion itself, which has tried (once again) to make itself reasonable in the manner of philosophy and science. Modern angels are post-Christian, polymorphous, “popular.” They serve as totems and mentors in varying pantheons of (post-)modern beings such as celebrities, superheroes, creatures from fantasy novels and gaming worlds. The theologians’ angelology has been defeated, ignored. While traditional angels may well have sprung from official sources in “high religion,” modern angels seem in many cases to emanate from “below.” Modern angels have become significant figures for pop culture, youth culture or spe-cific sub-cultures. I am not particularly interested in the question of whether modern angels entail fine art or kitsch, the latter a term whose dismissive use often strikes me as denying its users’ own personal or cultural subject position. 50 Aupers, Houtman, and Pels, ‘Cybergnosis: Technology, Religion, and the Secular’, 690–691; Poggioli, Theory of the Avant-Garde, esp. Ch. 2 (“The Concept of a Movement”). It is re-markable how frequently Poggioli, describing artistic and literary movements, uses terms like “mystical” or “mysticism,” “spiritual,” “spiritual attitude,” “proselytizing,” labeling of-fending positions “as heresies,” etc.51 Links between English fin-de-siècle occultists and the intellectual avant-garde have been noted by Owen, The Place of Enchantment, 132–146."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Schorsch420<UN>Those who depict modern angels reject, often quite consciously, the modern segregation of domains such as art, religion and science from one another. These artists make up members, to one degree or another, of a number of often identifiable subcultures promulgating counter-Enlightenment rhetoric and/or action.As art has come to emphasize imagination and inner states, has come to replace and/or complement religion as the site of the metaphysical, “the spiri-tual,” what Jean-Luc Nancy has called “a beyond-religion,” the representation of “impossible” metaphysical possibilities such as angels became an increas-ingly attractive and important response to modernity and post-modernity – i ndustrialism, war-turned-genocide, class oppression, personal alienation; a means of working through anxieties regarding the rapidly destabilized bound-aries between human and divine, human and animal, human and machine. With incredible persistence yet novel application, modern angels stand as al-lusions to in-betweenness and uncertainty regarding the anti-metaphysical progressivism of scientific-technological modernity.As is evident from the artists treated here, modern angels no longer neces-sarily allude to a coherent theological place. It is not clear, after all, whether Doitschinoff ’s and Bruskin’s works are about religion or are examples of reli-gious art.52 Yet each artist engages with the viewer’s gnoseological and not just their aesthetic faculties. They are not merely commenting on angels and/or angelology, but wielding angels as a trope that continues to draw on and draw out resonances in the viewer, between the viewer and a complex of religious-aesthetic discourse. Their angels are not figures from any canon and do not figure in any narrative contexts from the traditional religious repertoire. No longer mere auxiliaries, intermediaries or backdrop, these angels have become central subjects in their own right. Modern artists, like medieval mystics, con-jure up new angels as needed.5352 I take this terminology from Alexandrova, ‘Death in the Image’, 772.53 The anti-tradition, anti-authority impulses of modern art produces angels “liberated” from the canon, just as abstract art desired to liberate aesthetic production and consump-tion from the shackles of history and discourse. Georges Bataille reflects this modernist individualism perfectly: ‘By inner experience I understand that which one usually calls mystical experience: the states of ecstasy, of rapture, at least of meditated emotion. But I am thinking less of confessional experience, to which one has had to adhere up to now, than of an experience laid bare, free of ties, even of an origin, of any confession whatever’ (Inner Experience, 3). This whole approach yields and/or parallels a free-floating esoteri-cism unattached to any particular tradition, a paradoxical culmination and surpassing of particular esoteric traditions that have themselves always been syncretistic."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"421Modern Angels, Avant-gardes And The Esoteric Archive <UN>Like angels always, modern angels are in this world, but, unlike traditional angels, they are very much of it. One could say, as Peter Gordon does regarding two European philosophers drawn to both “archaism and modernism,” Franz Rosenzweig and Martin Heidegger, that the creators of modern angels ‘con-ceive of redemption, not as world-transcendence, but as a distinctive way of being-in-the-world.’54 This kind of transcendence, horizontal in time rather than vertical in space, parallels Derrida’s “messianicity,” a mode of organizing the mind-world through the promise of a difference, an elsewhere, a future.Modern angels comprise both ‘sacrilegious gestures and deliberate des-ecrations’ of old fashioned angels, on the one hand, and also, on the other, ‘consecrations, fetishizations, and auratic recoveries.’55 Many moderns angels confirm the modernist preference for ‘endless interpretability rather than abso-lute truth,’ as Robert Alter writes about Scholem’s view of Kafka.56 Yet through the creation of so many flawed angels, modern artists seek to redeem the pos-sibility of possibility, the hope for hope. Willingly or not, modern angels, too, have become wounded healers.The insistent proliferation of modern angels in the visible, in visual me-dia reflects a continuing, perhaps an increasing need to see them. Yet these angels are not so much seen as conjured. The artistic production of angels in our time may actually comprise a ritual response to existential-aesthetic dilemmas. The expression of modern angels may be itself the fulfillment of a wish, in the sense meant by Wittgenstein, a real, if limited becoming-angel for those who produce them. In this, modern artistic metaphysicists (the term comes from painter Giorgio de Chirico) use angels to continue the modernist artistic credo that ‘art [is] a re-enchantment of the world, not with gods, but with the play of the imagination.’57 Today, many angel images serve old/new iconographic purposes, as computer screen wallpaper or as visual objects for meditation, offering inspiration, reminders, challenges. Many modern angels comprise modern icons, almost always mysterious and perplexing, but ad-dressing the viewer directly, calling for attention, a response.

My argument is that the fragmentation of these images in the novel, where it becomes impossible to reach the “ur-images”, is a commentary on the postmodern condition and a perceived shattering of grand narratives and objective divine (or diabolic) truths. Signs and symbols become unstable and polyphonic floating signifiers. This renders the esoteric enlightenment, the single “true” meaning of the symbols, impossible to reach. The protago-nist is helped by Lucifer to accept this, and to realize that it sets him free: the absence of a limiting pre-scripted esoteric metanarrative enables him to cre-ate his own narrative as he embraces the liberty the postmodern condition brings. The metaphoric death of the “author”, and the dissipation of his one 1 Marlowe, The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus, 3, Act 1, Scene 1, lines 46–59.

Polanski’s film, on the other hand, retains the benevo-lent Lucifer, but here the figure instead acts as an initiator into a more classic esoteric enlightenment, where the series of engravings is ultimately restored to its complete, pristine condition and its riddle solved, dispelling the threat of postmodern dissolution of the symbolic. The Ninth Gate thus negates Pérez-Reverte’s reconfiguration of esoteric Luciferian enlightenment. In the film, as we will see, esoteric symbols are reintegrated into a metanarrative once more.In spite of El Club Dumas being a global bestseller, its author may require a brief introduction. Pérez-Reverte (b. 1951) has been described as the most com-mercially successful Spanish author of recent times, as well as the most popu-lar outside of his native country. The literary establishment in Spain was at first quite sceptical of him, but his status has gradually improved. In 2003 he was elected to the Real Academia Española, the Spanish Academy, a decision that was not uncontroversial. What sort of books does he write, then? Umberto Eco light, would perhaps be a convenient shorthand.2 Michael Dibdin of the New York Times has pronounced him a leading figure in the subgenre of ‘thrillers for people who don’t want to be seen reading thrillers’, an author who ‘flat-ters his reader’s sophistication and intelligence while delivering suspenseful stories’.3 El Club Dumas is Pérez-Reverte’s fourth novel and very obviously a light- hearted rejoinder to Eco’s Il pendolo di Foucault (“Foucault’s Pendulum”, 1988). It treats a similar theme (though, as we shall see, from a slightly different angle), the tendency to over-interpret a half arbitrary selection of the myri-ad of signs one comes across as being bearers of esoteric signification.4 The Spaniard in no way attempts to hide the resemblance to Eco’s novel, instead playfully indicating that he knows that we know.5The hero of the story is Lucas Corso, a “book detective” who specializes in finding rare books for fanatical wealthy collectors. He is hired by a certain 2 When Umberto Eco received his honorary doctorate at Uppsala University in January 2008, I had the opportunity to ask him what he thought of Pérez-Reverte and the parallels to his own work. Eco seemed amused by the work of his Spanish colleague. He agreed there are similarities, which he felt are a flattering tribute.3 Dibdin, ‘The Cocaine in Spain’.4 The theme of over-interpretation also ties in with a well-known theoretical book by Eco, Richard Dorty, Jonathan Culler and Christine Brooke-Rose, Interpretation and Over- Intepretation (1992, ed. Stefan Collini, based on Eco’s 1990 Tanner lectures). In this work, Eco debates with the other scholars who also contribute, and he cautions against relativistic no-tions of all interpretations being equally valid. For more on this, see below.5 For example, one of the methods Eco has developed in his scholarly works on semiotics ap-pears in the novel, and at the climax an unnamed professor of semiotics from Bologna (the same position Eco holds) makes a brief appearance.

This mysterious tome is a manual from 1666 that describes how Satan can be summoned.6 Borja believes at least one of the copies to be a forgery. Almost simultaneously, Corso comes across a chapter from Dumas’ original manuscript for Les Trois mousquetaires (“The Three Musketeers”, 1844). As the plot thickens and the owners of the other two copies of De Umbrarum are murdered, Corso starts to suspect there is a sinister connection between Dumas, Satan and the murders. By his side Corso con-stantly has a young girl, who gradually lets him understand that she is in fact, literally, the Devil. The Search for an Esoteric MetanarrativePérez-Reverte, I will argue, employs esoteric themes and motifs to illustrate ten-sions between postmodernity and older approaches to the world: the uphold-ing of absolute truths versus a thoroughgoing relativism, tradition and stability versus the total freedom of postmodern man (which results in a certain feeling of being lost), and so on.7 A sharp dichotomization like this can be strongly questioned as a model for understanding historical processes or the status of our contemporary age, and I would like to emphasize that my purpose here is to show how this figure of thought is expressed in the novel in question – not to claim the model is valid outside the limits of this piece of fiction.In an interesting article, Carolyn Durham analyses Corso’s ‘effort to tran-scend the episodic’, a sort of quest for a greater story, a metanarrative encom-passing the smaller episodes. She argues that the plethora of intertextual references in El Club Dumas invites the reader to actively collaborate in (re-)creating the text, a “constant” fashioned from the clichés of the canon of popu-lar fiction, especially the tales of adventure we read as children, to which there are many references in the novel.8 This, however, only captures one of the two parallel narratives in the book, the exoteric, where Dumas is the central figure and Corso seeks a popular culture metanarrative to make things intelligible. 6 The name Borja is another literary joke, and refers to Jorge Luis Borges.7 Several critics have highlighted postmodern traits in Pérez-Reverte’s novel, but with an em-phasis on different aspects than the ones I focus on. Ewa Mazierska, for example, briefly remarks on how the author’s stressing of questions of authorship/translation and the mixing of fact with fiction and spoof make the text “postmodern”.

Here, the struggle by the characters to transcend the episodic should instead be understood in terms of the classic esoteric stance where the world is read like a book filled with hidden signs. The quest, however, comes to nothing. The final message of the novel is, as we shall see, that there is no grand narrative comprising and making meaningful the episodic nature of life, neither in popular culture nor in esotericism. The time of the great truths is past, and in this lies a new freedom: liberty from the one true interpretation with its basis in God or (by extension) an author.9 Overthrowing the Author, God and the MetanarrativeIt is possible here to draw an analogy with Roland Barthes’ classic essay “La mort de l’auteur” (“The Death of the Author”). It was published for the first time in 1968, the year of the revolution, fittingly enough for a text that was an important predecessor of postmodern and deconstructionist theory. Barthes objects to biographical readings of texts, since they are in his opinion expres-sions of the idea that a text has a single fixed meaning, a notion that he force-fully rejects. To him, the meaning of a text is something actively created in the process of interpretation, not something stable and finished embedded in it. Barthes writes: ‘We know now that a text is not a line of words releasing a single “theological” meaning (the “message” of the Author-God).’10 I would suggest that the telling choice of metaphors, where God and theology are be-ing overthrown by the reader, makes Lucifer, the rebel against God’s superior-ity, a particularly suitable symbol of the allure of such a view of texts. While Barthes, of course, never evinced any sympathy for the Devil, he was quite ex-plicit about the irreligious implications of his ideas. Later in the essay, he states that the ultimate consequence of the model for reading he propagates in fact 9 A partly similar close reading is done by Robert Richmond Ellis (‘Detectives, mad book-men, and the devil’s disciples’), who does not, however focus on the esoteric motifs. My own interpretation takes some inspiration from Ellis pertaining to the following: Accord-ing to Ellis, the novel depicts a world where all forms of meaning are ephemeral. Man, metaphorically reading the world like a book, is engaged in an act of quasi creation. Even if the reading does not reach any permanent truths it is a noble gesture of freedom. To Ellis, Corso becomes a counter-creator, a rebel who through his interpretations creates a world of his own with an inner logic in opposition to external reality.10 Barthes, Image Music Text, 146."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"429The Death of the Author and the Birth of the Luciferian Reader<UN>is a discarding of God, in a purely religious sense as well as pertaining to the systems that metaphorically are God’s hypostases.11Barthes, who was hardly a full-fledged “postmodernist” himself, still gave im-portant impulses to later theories usually labelled thus.12 When it comes to the term itself, Jean-François Lyotard’s definition of it is perhaps the most influen-tial. In his main work La Condition postmoderne (“The Postmodern Condition”, 1979), Lyotard contends that a subjective pluralism has now replaced the great cultural stories or metanarratives (the Christian salvation, the Enlightenment’s idea of progression, socialist utopias, etc). Lyotard writes: ‘Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives. [...] To the obsolence of the metanarrative apparatus of legitimation corresponds, most notably, the crisis of metaphysical philosophy [...]. The narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal.’13 The postmodern condition, then, is a stage in the ontological develop-ment of mankind, where the metanarratives crumble.14 Such a view of the or-der of things can also be found in Pérez-Reverte, as will presently be discussed.Regardless of the impact Barthes, Lyotard and related thinkers have had in the humanities and social sciences, there are good reasons to be hesitant concerning the oft-repeated and somewhat over-simplified description of our time as one which (even outside the scholarly ivory tower) is typified by the lack of Great Truths.15 This stereotypical analysis is even so a fruitful frame for the present close reading, since it seems to have inspired the situation explicit-ly presented in the novel: Corso feels at a loss in a time when the number of in-tertexts is increasing rapidly and the limits of interpretation (to borrow a term from Eco) are crumbling, an age where it is ‘as easy to fall short of the truth as to overshoot it with one’s interpretations’.16 The ephemeral meanings of our 11 Barthes, Image Music Text, 146–147.12 On Barthes’ importance for postmodernism, see Wiseman, The Ecstasies of Roland Barthes, xiv, 2, 15.13 Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition, xxiv.14 Cf.

Intertextuality is a notoriously fuzzy concept. It was introduced by Julia Kristeva, who drew on concepts in Mikhail Bakhtin’s work when she developed it. The term should not be understood merely as a different label for influ-ence or allusion, but rather as denoting the fact that the meaning of a text arises in the meeting with a reader (not at the moment its author writes it) whose understanding of it will inevitably be coloured by a familiarity with other texts. Meaning thus “appears” in the space between texts – the intertextual space (cf. Kristeva, Desire in Language, 36–38, 85–86; Culler, The Pursuit of Signs, 100–118). For a discussion of the geneaology of the"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Faxneld430<UN>era makes him envy his great-grandfather, who was a soldier under Napoleon in a time when ‘the Emperor was the Emperor, a rose was a rose was a rose’.17Corso’s realization of the uncertainty of meaning also makes him aware that he himself, as a reader of the world around him, is possibly over- interpreting symbols and parallels.18 All the same, towards the ending he becomes con-vinced of the absolute truth of his own interpretation, according to which Dumas and his writings are intertwined with the Satanic grimoire. As Corso perceives things, the author of Les Trois mousquetaires was involved with shady esotericists, and in the present day there are sinister figures simultane-ously pursuing the rare manuscript of the chapter from this novel and De Um-brarum.19 Conceitedly, Corso believes he has closed the system, so to speak, and extracted a “theological” (in Barthes’ pejorative sense) single truth from his selection of intertexts. Finally, it becomes clear to our hero that he has failed, and has tried to connect completely separate narratives. There is no link between Dumas and De Umbrarum. A specialist of literature named Boris Bal-kan gives him a hectoring elucidation at this point, where Corso is blamed for his ‘excessive intertextual reading and linking of literary references’.20 These words can – since they apply equally to Corso’s speculations about esoteric symbolism – in the spirit of Eco’s Il pendolo di Foucault also be seen as a criti-cism of the overheated correspondence teachings of esotericism. Corso’s imag-inative allegorical readings, where he sees motifs from the symbolic universe of esotericism in events around him and tries to join together two completely separate plots, thus partly becomes a satire of typical esotericist tendencies, just like in Eco. A number of typical such esoteric strategies of interpretation can be found in the protagonist’s attitude: he seeks hidden connections every-where, reads all texts symbolically, gives the most profane works an esoteric significance, and views books and works of art as talismans or spells.21term “intertextuality”, and how Kristeva’s original usage has been disregarded by many of those who have employed it later, see Becker-Leckrone, Julia Kristeva and Literary Theory, 92–97.17 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 235. Pérez-Reverte is here of course referencing Gertrude Stein and her famous phrase ‘a rose is a rose is a rose’, which appears in several places in her works.18 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 241.19 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 298.20 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 334.21 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 105–107, 233–234, 241, 246, 285–286, 301–302.

And books as a reflection of life.’) may to some extent have been misguided in his interpretations.23 Yet, he is an intelligent person, and all such persons enjoy games, just like the Devil. This shared predilection is pointed out in the novel by the baroness von Ungern, owner of one of the copies of De Umbrarum.24 Such playfulness is seen in a highly positive light here. For the scholarly se-miotician Umberto Eco it is important to arrive at some form of reasonable meaning. He has explained that he accepts that a text can have multiple mean-ings, but refuses to accept that it can have any meaning.25 To Pérez-Reverte this matter is of no consequence as long as the semiotic game is amusing, creative and liberating.Accordingly, the girl at Corso’s side is a Satan who has been drastically re-interpreted and freed from the constraints of Christian tradition. This fallen angel does not want him to sign a pact, brushing such questions aside with the words ‘Don’t be silly’. Her purpose is not, as would traditionally have been the case, to rob man of his soul and put him in infernal chains. Instead, Satan seems to have come to proclaim humanity’s complete freedom, in a different and more radical sense than orthodox theology’s notion of free will.26 The aforementioned baroness von Ungern emphasizes Lucifer as the torch bearer of freedom, and performs a counter reading of the Bible: ‘Scholarly demonol-ogy identifies Lucifer with knowledge. In Genesis, the devil in the form of a serpent succeeds in getting man to stop being a simpleton and gain aware-ness, free will, lucidity, knowledge, with all the pain and uncertainty that they 22 Anne L. Walsh similarly suggests that one of the major points Pérez-Reverte makes in most of his novels is ‘that what matters is the process of interpreting (...) fiction, that it is the act of reading and not the production of one finite interpretation that is most impor-tant’.

Satan’s function as initiator is underscored by the girl repeatedly explaining her purpose is to guard over Corso, similar to how an adept is lead along the path of initiation by his esoteric mentor.29When the girl enumerates things the Devil can offer, Corso replies causti-cally: ‘You have to pay with the innocence of your soul’ and then receives the answer: ‘You paid long ago, Corso. You’re still paying.’30 From this we can un-derstand that the price equals the consequences of man being set free from absolute truths, that is, the agonies of postmodernity that torment Corso (iden-tical to the ‘pain and uncertainty’ the baroness talks of in the quote above) and make him long for the era of his great-grandfather. Instead of the traditional handing over of the soul to Satan, the price is now to decline the safety of blind dogmatism as well as all trust in absolute authority, just like Lucifer did when rebelling against God. What Lucifer, the girl, wants to divulge to Corso is the freedom that this suffering is a by-product of. A Satanic Subverter of Absolute TruthsEl Club Dumas is, as mentioned, filled with references to other literary works. One of the most prominent explicit intertexts is Jacques Cazotte’s Le Diable amoureux (“The Devil in Love”, 1772), where a young man named Alvare sum-mons Satan in the shape of an androgynous woman, whose gender identity is, to say the least, unstable.31 It appears Pérez-Reverte’s description of the role 27 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 230, 241. Quote on p. 230. The baroness is here in agree-ment with a well-established tradition of seeing Lucifer as a symbol of intellectual en-lightenment, which stretches back to Romantic authors and socialists employing the figure thus. In esotericism, this notion was first firmly established by H.P. Blavatsky, partly drawing on some ideas in the writings of Eliphas Lévi. I will return to this in the section below where I discuss Polanski’s film.28 Cf.

With the help of miraculous esoteric powers he imagined followed from this, he attempted a counter-revolution of the mystics during the French Revolution. In his opinion, the revolution was caused by the teachings of the Enlightenment philosophers, which brought about a spirit of carelessness and immorality.

Cazotte was outraged by the revolutionary age he lived in. As an esoteric Catholic and conservative royalist he celebrated absolute criteria for morality, religion and government. To him, Satan, whose demons do their work through mankind, was the direct originator of the revolution. Especially women, who he claimed were unable to reject demonic advances, were to blame. Woman, the accomplice of the powers of evil, drags man down to Hell with her.32 That Satan assumes the shape of a woman, as well as the role of a destroyer of ab-solute truths, has its logic in this misogynist anti-Enlightenment worldview.33Satan in androgynous, hermaphrodite or female shape is nothing new.34 In Cazotte, however, the figure can be read as a symbol specifically of dissolu-tion of fixed forms and categories. Pérez-Reverte’s use of the motif is in the same spirit, but with a positive rather than negative view of the demonic, and it is now linked to postmodern theory’s hostility towards essentialism and uni-versal fixed categories. Lucifer – neither man nor woman, and now seemingly beyond Christianity’s straightforward label of ultimate evil – becomes a post-modern fallen angel. The condition of the world that Pérez-Reverte portrays, where constants and metanarratives are crumbling, can be understood as a 32 Shaw, Jacques Cazotte (1719–1792), 100; Fleurant, ’Mysticism in the Age of Reason’, 69, 71, 73. See also Décote, L’itinéraire de Jacques Cazotte (1719–1792).33 Note, however, that the letters from Cazotte that Fleurant draws on are written 20 years af-ter Le Diable amoureux. Nonetheless, judging by the novel the author seems to have held quite similar opinions already at this time. When Satan says to Alvare that man can be happy only with the help of lies (Cazotte, The Devil in Love, 118), i.e. subjective truths, we can see this as Cazotte critiqueing the negation of absolute truth, which he makes Satan a symbol of.34 I have written extensively on this motif elsewhere, e.g., Faxneld, Satanic Feminism, 75–86, Faxneld, ‘Witches, Anarchism, and Evolutionism’, 67–68; Faxneld, ‘Djävulen är en kvinna’, 12."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Faxneld434<UN>radicalization and deepening of conflicts that were present already in Cazotte’s time. Pérez-Reverte, though, chooses a position in relation to this problem that more or less inverts that found in Cazotte. This is expressed by the fact that Corso, unlike Alvare, does not end up turning Satan away. Instead, she remains by his side.Dorothea von Mücke has poignantly described the ritual where Alvare sum-mons the Devil: ‘The irony of this scene of initiation into secret knowledge is evident insofar as the neophyte does not acquire knowledge or insight at all; instead, he is overwhelmed by the appearance of something he does not understand.’35 Further into the story, Cazotte’s hero becomes paranoid and starts looking for conspiracies and hidden connections.36 Pérez-Reverte sketch-es a similar image, and the esoteric ritual where Alvare is ‘overwhelmed’ can be considered analogous to how Corso is led along a sort of initiatory path where he is overwhelmed by the number of possible intertexts and interpretations of signs. Corso’s eagerness to decipher what he perceives as symbols is also simi-lar to the confused striving for coherency observable in Strindberg’s protago-nist in Inferno (1897), a horror image of how an adept gets lost in the forest of signs, stares wildly in all directions and becomes paranoid instead of reaching enlightenment.37 Eco’s Il pendolo di Foucault and the over- enthusiastic esoteric interpretations that it parodies is also, again, an obvious parallel.Cazotte’s hero is warned by the older men introducing him to esoteric practises that he has not gone through the prescribed two-year probation. In short, he has not followed the traditional road to initiation, precisely like Corso. Perhaps it is for that reason both achieve a direct relation to Satan, a connection quite different from how the two novels’ more traditionally mind-ed esotericists imagine it should be.38 In Le Diable amoureux, Satan explains that she has been allowed to assume physical form in order to accompany a wise man whom she will instruct in the sublimity of his being, the privileges of which he does not yet know. This man will subdue the spirits of the spheres, and become king of the world, and she shall reign as his queen.39 This has its equivalent in how the girl in El Club Dumas instructs Corso in his sovereign nature as interpreter of the fleeting and unbound signs, constrained by neither God nor tradition. Thus, he too, metaphorically, becomes the king of the world who rules and defines all things around him.35 Mücke, The Seduction of the Occult and the Rise of the Fantastic Tale, 24.36 Cazotte, The Devil in Love, 88.37 Strindberg, Inferno, passim.38 Cazotte, The Devil in Love, 56, 66.

The central cause for hesitation, in terms of Todorov’s fantastic, is in both works whether the girl really is Satan. Pérez-Reverte’s tale is also characterized by an insecurity about whether Corso is on a path to initiation in esoteric mysteries. The fantastic genre as defined by Todorov is unwilling to settle for a single truth, preferring to permanently entertain two or more truths. Incidentally, this appears quite similar to the attitude of Barthes and his post-modern successors. The Fragmentation of the Faustian ManualCazotte’s novel is to a great extent a variation of the Faust theme. As in El Club Dumas, magical books often play a central part in Faust tales. In Marlowe’s ver-sion, for example, Faust is given books by Lucifer’s messenger Mephostophilis, which contain spells giving him power over creation.41De Umbrarum, Pérez-Reverte’s fictional Faustian manual, becomes a fur-ther tool for him to emphasize the problem of postmodernity. The book was printed in 1666 by the warlock Aristide Torchia, and contains nine engravings said to reproduce woodcuts from the Delomelanicon, an even older book sup-posedly written by Lucifer himself, around 6000 bc, as an initiatory tool for his adherents.42 In two of the three copies, three different engravings in each are signed by Torchia only in the capacity of engraver, while the artist is given as L.F. (Lucifer). Herein lies the riddle of the book. The woodcuts that are initia-tory messages straight from Lucifer are divided between all three copies. Only when they are united will the Satanic gospel become complete and the ninth and final gate to the dark enlightenment can be opened. In Borja’s copy, how-ever, only two of the woodcuts actually have L.F. as their artist. The third turns out to be a present-day forgery, done by two highly skilled bookbinders and forgers. The original pages have been lost sometime during the book’s journey 40 Todorov, The Fantastic, 24–27, 82, 85.41 Marlowe, The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus, 18. Cf E.M.

Hence, the three copies can no longer be united into the one true book.43De Umbrarum becomes an illustration of the postmodern condition: in our time there is no book with a capital B to be found, nor any supreme truth or metanarrative encompassing all components or encapsulating all intertexts. Since a component is missing and is irretrievable, the Delomelanicon’s esoteric message straight from Satan is no longer available. It becomes as inaccessible as, in the words of Barthes, the author god’s single theological meaning ( just like God’s words are impossible to reach through the Bible deconstructed by modern redaction criticism, one might perhaps further speculate). In the world of Pérez-Reverte’s novel, the present-day Satan shows the way to a postmodern enlightenment, a self-deification of the reader through free interpretation of the text/images (also understood as interpretation of the world as a book or text), rather than, as in the old days, within the framework of an esoteric initia-tion giving absolute knowledge and thereby power over creation.The novel’s arch-Satanist Varo Borja is on the other hand stuck in the out-moded way of thinking. The ritual he performs at the climax of the novel, using the book as his guide, at first seems not to work at all. Then Corso casts a last glance at Borja in his magical circle: ‘Kneeling within it, bowing his distorted, fervent face toward the floor, Varo Borja was opening the last of the nine doors with a smile of insane joy’. On his way out from the castle, Corso hears how Borja cries out in despair and terror.44 Keeping to the conventions of the fan-tastic as defined by Todorov, Pérez-Reverte does not make it explicit whether Borja has lost his mind in sheer disappointment, or if he has really managed to open a gate to the kingdom of darkness. If he has succeeded, it is only a gate where the demons on the other side will tear his soul to pieces instead of bring-ing enlightenment and apotheosis. Regardless, what takes place is a dreadful event.The scene illustrates that the contents of books are no longer the way to enlightenment or absolute truths. The texts and images in them are shifting, changeable over time, unreliable floating signifiers.45 Yet, this results in the 43 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 126, 162–163, 248–249, 281–282, 362.44 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 360–361.45 It is unclear what (if anything) is different between the three copies of De Umbrarum aside from the variations in the images. We can assume, however, that both written text and image can here be viewed as “texts” in the wider sense (i.e., the discussions regarding intertextuality etc pertain to them in equal measure).

Possibly with inspiration from Barthes’ well-known 1968 essay, the metaphoric death of the “author”, and the dissipa-tion of his one true narrative, has enabled Corso’s self-apotheosis. On the final page of the novel, he notes that he no longer casts a shadow. This can be seen as a sign that he has now fully become an adherent of the Devil, since such individuals are traditionally held by folklore and in literature to have forfeited their shadow.48Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s novel, to summarize, appears in some sense to be a Luciferian celebration of the postmodern condition and its strategies of reading. For a global bestseller, this is certainly a rather surprising pro-Satanic message. The Devil’s Gateway on the Silver ScreenIn 1999, a cinematic adaptation of the novel was released, directed by Ro-man Polanski and starring Johnny Depp as Corso. The film had the title The Ninth Gate, which indicates the fact that Polanski and his two collaborators on the script completely omit the subplot concerning Dumas, instead focusing exclusively on the esoteric quest. This quest is radically reconfigured, and is employed to present a view of the world in diametrical opposition to Pérez-Reverte’s vision – Polanski’s film ends with Corso gaining a classical esoteric enlightenment after having miraculously retrieved the missing “ur-image”.The film does not reference Cazotte, and the girl does not explain to Corso that she is the Devil (as she does, in an ironic tone of voice, in the novel). Judging by reviews of the film, many critics were therefore confused by this character, and found her powers and function in the narrative difficult to understand. The ending, where Corso enters the ninth gate and disappears into a blinding light, 46 Pérez-Reverte, The Club Dumas, 335.47 Milton, The Complete Poetical Works, 160.48 Rudwin, The Devil in Legend and Literature, 174.

Scholars or practitioners of esotericism, on the other hand, in general seem to have little trouble comprehending the rough outlines of what is going on, at least pertain-ing to the ending. The girl, however, remains somewhat mysterious to almost everyone unfamiliar with the novel. Nevertheless, it is risky to interpret the film using the novel as some sort of explanatory manual. Perhaps the girl isn’t even Satan in the film. This, after all, is Polanski’s vision, not Pérez-Reverte’s. An indication that she is Satan here as well is even so perhaps to be found. On three occasions, a page from De Umbrarum is shown which has an ornament depicting a goatlike Satan with breasts. The presense of this feminized Devil might be taken as a hint concerning Corso’s companion.Cinema scholar Ewa Mazierska has pointed out that the girl’s ‘protective behaviour towards Corso (...) likens her to the figure of a guardian angel, and at some point Corso asks her whether she is his holy guardian’. This, Mazierska argues, ‘leads to the conclusion that the difference between angels and devils is insignificant’.50 For scholars of esotericism, and viewers well-versed in Aleister Crowley’s writings, it might instead suggest the British magus’ famed personal Holy Guardian Angel, Aiwass, whom he also identified with Satan.51Towards the end of the film, the girl and Corso have intercourse beneath the burning castle where Boris Balkan (who in the film is identical to the charac-ter named Varo Borja in the novel) has unsuccessfully tried to open the ninth gate. She straddles Corso, and looks very much like the Whore of Babylon (Rev. 17–18) riding the seven-headed beast, as depicted in one of the engravings in De Umbrarum. Corso, then, would be the beast (an envoy of Satan in the Bible), which is a rather peculiar symbolism that does not immediately seem to fit with anything hinted at earlier in the story. Regarding the girl, one might here come to think of one of Aleister Crowley’s comments to the Book of the Law: ‘She is Sakti, the Teh, the magical door between the Tao and the manifested world. The great obstacle then is if that door be locked up. Therefore Our Lady 49 Joshua Gunn even goes so far as to claim that ‘critics were obsessed with the ambiguous ending’, and singles it out as the main reason why the film was panned in most reviews (Gunn, Rhetoric, Culture, and Social Critique, 206). Tom Deveny has unconvincingly ar-gued that the ending has ‘connotations [that] point toward further sexual encounters’. Deveny, ‘The Club Pérez-Reverte’, 274.50 Mazierska, Roman Polanski, 121.51 Having received The Book of the Law from Aiwass in 1904, it was not until 1929 (in Magick in Theory and Practice) that Crowley identified this entity with his Holy Guardian Angel, and simultaneously with Lucifer/Satan.

In the context at hand, we might further relate this to Tertullian’s famous words about woman as the Devil’s gateway, a misogynist assertion – with reference to Eve’s collusion with Satan – that the stern Church Father makes in his De cultu feminarum (“On the Apparel of Women”).53Tertullian’s words can be viewed here in terms of Polanski’s famous earlier exploration of Satanism, the 1968 film Rosemary’s Baby (based on Ira Levin’s 1967 best seller). Young Rosemary is chosen by a Satanist sect to play, in a more literal sense, the part Tertullian says is typical of her sex: she will give birth to Satan’s son, who will act as his father’s emissary. In other words, woman’s womb is the portal through which Satan is able to enter our world. The Ninth Gate inverts this notion of Satan gaining entrance to the realm of man by using woman as a gateway. Instead, woman is the Devil (or his servant the Whore of Babylon), who functions as the gateway from our world into the spiritual en-lightenment awaiting in the demonic realm (the blinding light of the kingdom of shadows). Luciferian EnlightenmentThis interesting contradiction in terms, where the kingdom of shadows is home to the light, reflects a view of Satan that started to gain ground among certain esotericists in the mid-nineteenth century. At this time, Eliphas Lévi (1810–1875) pioneered an ambivalent view of Lucifer as identical with a cos-mic fluidum he designated the “astral light”, but was hesitant about taking this one step further into a full rehabilitation of the fallen angel. Romantic poets like William Blake (1757–1827) and Percy Shelley (1792–1822) had of course al-ready celebrated Satan in several works, and were followed by later authors like Nobel laureate Giosuè Carducci (with his infamous hymn to science and progress “Inno a Satana”, 1863) that were even more blatant in their sympathy for the Devil.54In the realm of esotericism, however, the first influential figure to open-ly make a hero of Satan was Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831–1891), chief 52 Crowley, The Law is for All, 304.53 On this, see Church, ‘Sex and Salvation in Tertullian’.54 Faxneld, ‘The Devil is Red’; Faxneld, ‘Blavatsky the Satanist’; Faxneld, Satanic Feminism, 58–60, 113–204."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"Faxneld440<UN> ideologist of the Theosophical Society. Her magnum opus, The Secret Doctrine (1888), contained a lengthy discussion of how Lucifer (a name she uses inter-changeably with Satan and the Devil) in the guise of the serpent had acted as mankind’s liberator in the Garden of Eden (cf. the Baroness von Ungern’s simi-lar words concerning this in both novel and film). The etymological meaning of his name, “lightbringer”, thus symbolized how he persuaded Eve to eat of the forbidden fruit – an act that bestowed enlightenment upon man. According to Blavatsky, Satan helped us reach a higher spiritual level, to ‘be as Elohim’.55 He stands for ‘the Light of Knowledge’ and is the ‘ever-living symbol – nay apotheosis – of self-sacrifice for the intellectual independence of mankind’.56It is easy to see how this interpretation of Lucifer, which influenced many later esotericists (and is hence something that any author, script writer or film director making rudimentary research into esoteric Satanism would come across), resonates strongly with the ethos that I have suggested the figure rep-resents in both Pérez-Reverte’s novel and Polanski’s film. What we are witness-ing in the final shot of the film, then, is the entry of the protagonist into the realm of the Luciferian Light, which according to Blavatsky has been misrepre-sented by the profane and exoteric as a kingdom of shadows.57 Polanski’s Rehabilitation of the (Esoteric) MetanarrativeIn the film, Corso is, unbeknownst to himself, on the path to this esoteric illumination from the very beginning, even if he at first is merely a rather cyni-cal and mercenary book detective who is sceptical of the supernatural. The Todorovian hesitation is not upheld here, however, and the fantastic elements are eventually fully affirmed as real (for example, the girl flies through the air on two occasions). Mazierska, though not relating it to Todorov, also remarks on how the film ‘rarely, if ever’ forces us ‘to choose between conflicting percep-tions or conflicting realities’.58 Communication studies scholar Joshua Gunn takes a different view, and claims that ‘in The Ninth Gate the existence of [a] su-pernatural presence, that is, of a transcendental signified, is not guaranteed’.59 55 Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine, 243.56 Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine, 507. Emphasis in original.57 For a full discussion of Blavatsky’s complex view of Lucifer, see Faxneld, ‘Blavatsky the Satanist’.58 Mazierska, Roman Polanski, 89.59 Gunn, Rhetoric, Culture, and Social Critique, 217."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"441The Death of the Author and the Birth of the Luciferian Reader<UN>I do not agree with Gunn, and would say that at least to the spectator, if not to Corso himself within the diegesis of the film (he does not have a clear view of the girl on the two occasions when she flies through the air), it is obvious that the girl is supernatural.60 This has radical implications for the whole story, and for the semiotic quest at its core.Further underscoring the distancing from Todorovian hesitation and post-modern permanent ambiguity, the discussion of the postmodern condition and models of interpretation is gone, and the protagonist’s journey is no longer one from credulity and naïve striving for a metanarrative to postmodern disbe-lief and subjectivism. Instead, Corso is gradually initiated into the mysterious reality underlying the world’s mundane surface, which is really filled with eso-teric signs (that are readable) and secret Satanist sects (in the novel, what he believes to be a coven of devil worshippers turns out to be a Dumas fan club).This is somewhat paradoxical, since The Ninth Gate is simultaneously to a great extent a deconstruction and parody of clichés concerning Satanism in cinema. In the same manner that Polanski parodied the 1950s and 60s vam-pire films of Hammer Studios in The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967), he here satirizes Hammer’s adaptation of Dennis Wheatley’s novel The Devil Rides Out (1934 and 1968 respectively).61 In a scene not present in Pérez-Reverte’s novel, Borja interrupts a gathering of wealthy Satanists – a group quite similar to the baleful upper-class black magicians in the Wheatley/Hammer film – by loudly exclaiming the words ‘mumbo-jumbo’. The Satanists turn out to be a group of cowardly buffoons, and Balkan contemptously declares to them that ‘I alone have fathomed the master’s grand design.’ Remarkably, there is an esoteric grand design to be found in this film, even if it turns out Balkan has not grasped it either.6260 Caputo views The Ninth Gate as containing ‘diegetically unambiguous supernatural activ-ity’, yet still stresses that it is the spectator, but not Corso, who sees the girl fly. Caputo, Polanski and Perception, 240–241. Quote on p. 240.61 Compare, for example, the corresponding scenes in the two films where the upper-class satanists have gathered at a posh mansion and their fancy cars are parked outside.62 Gunn points out a parallel between Balkan’s pompous monologue and the charismatic rhetoric of Aleister Crowley (Gunn, Rhetoric, Culture, and Social Critique, 217). Specifically, he compares Balkan’s words to those of Crowley concerning the interpretation of the central Thelemic text: ‘I lay claim to be the sole authority competent to decide disputed points with regard to the Book of the Law, seeing that its Author, Aiwas, is none other than mine own Holy Guardian Angel, to Whose Knowledge and Conversation I have at-tained, so that I have exclusive access to him’ (Crowley, The Equinox of the Gods, 127). He does not analyze this resemblance further, but I would suggest it points to the decisive difference between Balkan and Corso. Balkan is clearly represented as a megalomaniac"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Faxneld442<UN>At first uninterested in the concept of Luciferian apotheosis, the film’s Corso finally goes in search of it after the initiatory act of lovemaking. The girl leaves him a message leading him to where the supposedly lost “ur-image” can be found. Balkan’s ritual was a failure due to one of the engravings he utilized having been replaced with a forgery. Corso finds the original as the workshop of the forgers, a pair of bookbinder twin brothers, is being cleaned out. He can now make the message from Lucifer, the author(anti-)-God, whole once more, and by reassembling the metanarrative and piecing together a complete sym-bolic system he can open the ninth gate. Interestingly (provided we accept that the girl is Satan just like in the novel), this is accomplished with the direct as-sistance of the author (Lucifer) herself, thus reasserting the ultimate authority of the author over the text. In Polanski’s retelling of the tale, then, fragmenta-tion and the postmodern condition are conquerable, and esotericism provides the path to a rehabilitated metanarrative. Real Satanism?Unsurprisingly, not everyone perceives the film’s approach to the theme of postmodernity this way. The very opposite conclusion to mine is drawn in Davide Caputo’s book Polanski and Perception (2012):Unbeknownst to the spectator, Corso ultimately reconsiders some of his most basic rationalist framworks and enters a truly “postmodern condi-tion”. The transition is aptly symbolised by his penetration of the frame, the act through which he abandons the spectator; and so Corso renounc-es his role as object of our perception by escaping diegesis itself.63Caputo’s list of indications that The Nith Gate is postmodern include ‘the gen-eral ambivalence with which good and evil are treated’, that it presents ‘a dieg-esis in which cinematic citations flow seamlessly in conversation’ and the fact that ‘Corso seems to “rise above” the highly Christianity-informed version of Satanism embodied by the “Order of the Serpent” [the film’s Satanist sect], and also moves beyond Balkan’s still-relativistic criticism of their rituals, towards trapped within his subjective understanding, who has indeed not gained any access at all to Lucifer, the author of De Umbrarum. Corso, on the other hand, has. For this reason, he is able to enter the gate which remains barred to Balkan.63 Caputo, Polanski and Perception, 236."},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"443The Death of the Author and the Birth of the Luciferian Reader<UN>a postmodern, even post-religious condition.’64 The last point is hard to find any support for in the film, and Corso – guided by the Devil herself – could instead be understood as attaining a higher, more esoteric understanding of the Satanic mysteries, which is certainly not post-religious, nor postmodern.In his rich and creative analysis of the film, Joshua Gunn has claimed that ‘The Ninth Gate is an accurate, postmodern representation of modern occultism’.65 By contrast, I have argued that it is in certain crucial ways a re-jection of postmodern ontology. What of Gunn’s assertion that it faithfully reflects modern occultism? While he does not substantiate his contention by a detailed comparison to specific ideas that are prominent in today’s occult milieu, Caputo does, on the other hand, attempt precisely this. He suggests the film’s Satanist sect has borrowed its visual style from Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan, but proposes that the ruthless Corso comes closest to representing the LaVeyan ethos of selfishness and equality with God.66 Yet, the equality with God that the Satanists in The Ninth Gate strive for is far removed from what LaVey meant by this. The more or less atheist LaVey simply proclaimed that man should not bow down to any external authorities, but trust in himself.67Coming from a very different angle, Boris Balkan, and eventually Corso, too, aim for a literal self-deification, where they would gain supernatural powers and a cosmic stature on par with that of God. Such lofty goals are certainly not unheard of in contemporary Satanism, but are to be found elsewhere than in the Church of Satan. In groups that we (following Danish Satanism expert Jesper Aa. Petersen’s typology) can define as representatives of esoteric Satan-ism, and in a majority of so-called of Left-Hand Path groups (as delineated by Finnish scholar Kennet Granholm), this in fact tends to explicitly be the central purpose of their endeavors.68 Appearing after LaVey’s atheist dismiss-al in the 1960s of esoteric traditions as a foundation of Satanism, these other groups largely seem to have been disappointed with his unorthodox approach and (more or less) represent a return to more time-honored and “religious” forms of esotericism.69 It can be said that Polanski’s narrative affirms their perspective, and thus indeed fairly accurately represents at least one form of contemporary Satanism.64 Caputo, Polanski and Perception, 237.65 Gunn, Rhetoric, Culture, and Social Critique, 215.

The latter rests on empirical and mathematical principles, exemplified by the legendary experiments of Pythagoras, which have given rise to the rich vein of musica speculativa that runs parallel to the Western esoteric tradition. Color, lacking harmony’s mathematical anchor and its link to perception (e.g., that the purest perceived interval, the octave, derives from the simplest proportion of 1:2; the perfect fifth from 2:3, and so on), is a fluctuating field, even in its major landmarks such as the primary colors. Its definitions rely not on number but on words, whose translation of the eye’s experience is at best imprecise and at worst contradictory.A second problem is the abstraction of colors from the things colored. To separate them and develop an independent color vocabulary did not come naturally to the ancients, though scholars resist the idea that they didn’t see colors as we do.2 Homer’s “wine-dark sea” and the multiple hues represented by purpureus (the murex dye) are well-known instances of the problem. When Pliny, a walking dictionary and generally so finicky in his categories, comes to write of the color of the eyes, the only one he names is caesius, a word used only of eyes and presumed to mean blue, or gray.3 The classical world, so ad-vanced in harmonics, has little to offer here.A third problem is color-blindness in its various forms. Since this affects 7–10% of Caucasian males, mostly functioning with perfect ease in a color-coded world, we wonder just what people are perceiving.

This essay aims to bring some order into the field, as a prelimi-nary to the longer study that has not yet been undertaken.41 The Doctrine of CorrespondencesI am not concerned here with the symbolism of colors, a subject with a for-midable literature of its own,5 but to sketch the ways in which color theory has interacted with esoteric modes of thought. These include the doctrine of correspondences, cosmic polarities and hierarchies, the fruitful coincidentia oppositorum, and access to the mundus imaginalis and other higher sources of knowledge.Systematic color theory was born along with heraldry in the chivalric world of the Middle Ages, as an aid to identification in the field of war or tourney. The heraldic art assigned easily-spotted shapes, symbols, and especially colors to knights and their troops, necessitating a standardization of terms. I suspect that it was the makers of stained glass, an art that reached a plateau of per-fection at the same time and place (12th-century France), who influenced the definition of the heraldic colors or “tinctures”. The term itself, from Latin tin-gere, refers to the dyeing or infusing of color in an uncolored substance. The windows of the Gothic cathedrals, whatever the subtleties of their blended effects, are made from distinct areas of red, blue, yellow, and green, set off by black framing and areas of plain (white) glass.From that day to this, the chief heraldic tinctures have been seven in num-ber, though purple is rarely found on older escutcheons. English heraldry still uses their French names (Table 18.1).The presence of gold and silver invites Hermetic notions of correspon-dence, and from the late Middle Ages onwards, heraldry became a playground for such speculations. One of the first systematic writers, Jean Courtois, in Le Blason des Couleurs (1414), aligns the tinctures with gemstones, ages of man, 4 humors, 4 elements, metals, planets, virtues, and days of the week.6 See Table 18.2 for Courtois’s planet-gemstone correspondences.A strict rule of heraldic design reflects the astrological distinction between the greater and the lesser luminaries, and the alchemical one between the noble and base metals.

Correct combinations, facilitating quick recognition in the field, take one tincture from each class. The reader may notice that the tradi-tional flags of most nations observe this rule.By the end of the sixteenth century, compiling tables of correspondences had become a heraldic fad. Sir John Ferne, in The Blazon of Gentrie (1586), ex-pounds fourteen modes of blazoning (description in heraldic language): by ‘colours, plannets, precious stones, vertues, celestiall signes, monethes of the yeare, days of the weeke, ages of man, flowers, elements, seasons of the yeare, complexions of man, numbers, and mettalles’.9Table 18.1 Table of heraldic Tinctures7OrGold or YellowArgentSilver or WhiteGulesRedAzureBlueSableBlackVertGreenPurpurPurpleTable 18.2 Jean Courtois, Blason des Couleurs (1414)Heraldic TincturePlanetGemstoneOrSunTopazArgentMoonPearlGulesMarsRubyAzureJupiterSapphireSableSaturnDiamondVertVenusEmeraldPurpurMercuryAmethyst"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Godwin450<UN>101110 Agrippa, Occult Philosophy, i, 99.11 As in Gafurio, Practica Musicae, frontispiece. The problem goes back to Ptolemy; see God-win, Harmonies, 139, for a comparative chart of planet-scales of this type.But outside heraldry we find no such regularity. Henry Cornelius Agrippa’s (1486–1535/6) compilation of medieval correspondence schemes in his De oc-culta philosophia (1533) assigns the metals and gems as found in Table 18.3.Later in the same book, Agrippa offers a list of planet-color correspondences confusing enough to fill the aspiring magician with despair: ‘Sapphire, and airy colors, and those which are always green, clear, purple, darkish, golden, mixed with silver, belong to Jupiter’.10The assignment of colors to planets, while ideally part of the great family of septenaries, is upset when the planetary system is extended. This had already occurred in the correspondences of the diatonic scale, whose seven notes, sanctified by Greek theory, were inadequate if tones were also to be assigned to the fixed stars, at one end of the cosmic ladder, and to the earth at the other.11 Table 18.3 Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, De Occulta Philosophia (1533), Book 1, 50–60PlanetMetalsGemsSunGoldCarbucle, Chrysolite, Iris [rock crystal], Green Heliotrope, Topaz, Chrysoprase, Ruby, Balas RubyMoonSilverCrystal, Silver Marcasite, Selenite, Pearls, Beryl, all white or green stonesSaturnLead, GoldGolden Marcasite, Onyx, Rainbow Topaz, Camonius, Sapphire, Brown Jasper, Chalcedony, LoadstoneJupiterTin, Silver, GoldHyacinth, Beryl, Sapphire, Emerald, Green JasperMarsIron, Red BrassDiamond, Loadstone, Bloodstone, Jasper, AmethystVenusSilver, Yellow and Red BrassBeryl, Chrysolite, Emerald, Sapphire, Green Jasper, Cornelian, Aetites, Lapis Lazuli, Coral, all varicolored, white, or green stonesMercuryQuicksilver, Tin, Silver MarcasiteEmerald, Agate, Red Marble, Topaz, varicolored and yellow-green stones"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"451Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>1212 Exodus 28:15–21 (Revised Standard Version).As an assiduous student of such systems, Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) chose a ninefold scheme in his Musurgia Universalis (1650). As regards color, this yielded the correspondences in Table 18.4.In this as in much else, Kircher was the last in his line. The heliocentric cos-mology and the discovery of the trans-Saturnian planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto made nonsense of such efforts. There was, however, a parallel system of cosmic color-correspondences that was unaffected. The seven planets may have become nine or ten, but there were still twelve signs in the zodiac.Not only that, but the Bible is a treasure-house for twelvefold schemes of cor-respondence. It does not name colors as such, for reasons already mentioned, but offers the next best thing: lists of gemstones, of which the diamond, topaz, emerald, sapphire, and amethyst are likely to have withstood the vagaries of translation and to be identifiable colors. One is the description of the High Priest’s breastplate as given in the Mosaic Law; the other, the foundations of the New Jerusalem as shown to Saint John the Divine:You shall set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and car-buncle shall be the first row; and the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; and the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they shall be set in gold filigree. There shall be twelve stones with their names according to the names of the sons of Israel; they shall be like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes.12Table 18.4 Athanasius Kircher, Musurgia Universalis (1650), Vol. 2, 393Mundus Sidereus (Starry World)ColorsFirmamentVarious colorsSaturnDark colorsJupiterRosyMarsFlamingSunGoldenVenusGreenMercuryBlueMoonWhiteEarthBlack"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Godwin452<UN>13141513 Revelation 21:18–21 (Revised Standard Version).14 See the sources collected by Greg Killian at http://www.betemunah.org/mazaroth.html.15 Fludd, Philosophia, 212.The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every jewel; the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emer-ald, the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.13While the similarity of the two lists has intrigued exegetes, a chain of asso-ciation has yielded a better-known and profitable result. Since the breastplate gems are engraved with the names of the twelve tribes, and these are tradition-ally assigned to the twelve signs of the zodiac,14 it invites a correspondence of gemstones with the months of the year. Hence the modern invention of “birthstones” beloved of jewelers, even if their lists vary both from those of the biblical commentators and among themselves. Later we will see how twelve-fold symbolism reentered color theory, but there are two other approaches to be reviewed first.2 Polarity: Colors between Darkness and LightA completely different approach to classifying color grew out of the concept of light and darkness as the duality or polarity behind manifestation. The theol-ogy of Dionysus the Areopagite (c.500) laid the basis for early modern specula-tion on these lines. Jakob Boehme (c.1575–1624) and Robert Fludd (1574–1637) made it one of the pillars of their own varieties of Christian Hermetic phi-losophy, which impressed itself on the esoteric imagination through its pow-er to generate symbolic images. It was left to Boehme’s followers (especially Dionysius Andreas Freher, 1649–1728, and Johann Georg Gichtel, 1638–1710) to do this for their master’s work, while Fludd himself adopted Nicholas of Cusa’s (1401–1464) ingenious emblem of two intersecting pyramids (evoking the Hermetic-Egyptian heritage) and devised many striking images from it. In its basic form15 the light pyramid or elongated triangle, representing spirit, de-scends from heaven, thinning out until it vanishes on reaching the earth. The dark pyramid, representing matter, ascends from the earth and vanishes at the threshold of heaven. All the phenomena of the intervening space (literal or metaphysical) contain a certain mixture of light and darkness, which we are inclined to perceive as good and evil."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"453Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>16171816 Aristotle, Physics, iv, 1, 208b.17 Aristotle, On Colours, ii, 792a.18 See Gage, Color and Culture, 229.The concept is more Aristotelian than Platonic, for in Aristotle’s physics the material world is generated from the interplay of two types of elements: Fire and Air, whose tendency is to move away from the center of the earth (per-ceived by us as upwards), and Water and Earth which have a centripetal or downward tendency.16 Aristotle also surmised that all colors derive from dif-ferent mixtures of light and darkness.17Fludd probably discovered the Opticorum libri sex (1613), by the Jesuit schol-ar François d’Aguilon (1567–1617),18 in which the colors are represented as a scale between black and white (Table 18.5).It remained for Fludd to bend Aguilon’s scale in a circle, thus making perhaps the first Color Wheel (Colorum Annulus). Its sectors go counter-clockwise, ac-cording to the sequence in Table 18.6.Moreover, Fludd’s colors correspond to the elements: fire to red, air to yel-low, water to white, and earth to black. This assignment is less Aristotelian than Biblical, for after the creation of light—memorably imaged by Fludd as the Holy Spirit making its first white flight through the black primordial chaos—God separated the waters from the dry land.

This alludes to alchemy, whose pre-modern color repertory defined a threefold sequence of operations. First is the Nigredo (when the matter turns black), then its puri-fication in the Albedo (white), and lastly the Rubedo (red). Later an interme-diate stage was inserted between the white and the red: either as a separate operation called Citrinitas (yellow) or as the confirmatory appearance of the many-colored Peacock’s Tail. But however viewed, it is the initial pair of Black and White that start the whole business, whether making a cosmos, a rainbow, or the Philosophers’ Stone.The versatile Kircher, when treating color from a scientific point of view (as opposed to the natural-magical point of view that informs his chart of cor-respondences already mentioned), borrowed Fludd’s pyramids and d’Aguilon’s scale to show how all colors are made from blendings between black and white. In his work on optics, Ars magna lucis et umbrae (1646) Kircher adds six more colors to d’Aguilon’s: subalbum (whitish), incarnatus (scarlet), cinereus (ashen), fuscus (dusky), subrubeus (reddish), and subcaeruleus (bluish). Even then he could not resist adding correspondences of the five principal colors to five gradations of light and of shadow, tastes, elements, ages of man, types of knowledge, beings, and Greek tonoi.19Like some color-blind people, such schemes suffer from a red-green dilem-ma. They are uncertain which of those obviously important colors should oc-cupy the median position between black and white. Fludd, as we may have noticed, finessed the issue by calling red the median between white and black, green the equality of light and darkness. Kircher, after d’Aguilon, places green directly above red, as one of a series of secondarily generated colors.In the next century, Père Castel (Louis-Bertrand Castel, S.J., 1688–1757), who as a fellow Jesuit held the then unfashionable Kircher in high regard, de-fended this color theory against Newton’s (see below). Castel is more famous for inventing an “ocular harpsichord” that showed colors when the keys were pressed. In the present instance the homely iron poker sufficed to prove his point.20 The cold iron is black; when heated in the fire it turns successively blue, purple, red, orange, yellow, and finally white-hot. Therefore all colors, Castel concludes, are generated not from Newton’s spectrum, but between the extremes of black and white, darkness and light.The next theorist bold enough to take a stand against Newton’s authority was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832). In his Farbenlehre (published"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"455Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>21222321 Goethe, Farbenlehre, paragraphs 503 (yellow), 504 (blue), 699–703 (red), 538–540 (green).22 Illustrated in Matthaei, Goethe’s Color Theory, 189; also on 188 a colored wheel of tempera-ments by Goethe and Schiller.23 See Gage, Colour and Culture, 194.1810)21 he derives colors in a similar way: blue as the first modification of dark-ness, yellow as the first modification of light, red as their meeting-point, and green (absent from Castel’s poker but present in his harpsichord) as the result of their mixture (Table 18.8).Goethe himself drew and painted a six-colored wheel, somewhat similar to Fludd’s but excluding black and white.22 Unfortunately his water-colors have faded over the centuries and the intended hues are lost, but its interest is in the correspondences with which he annotated it. These combine a moral phi-losophy of color with a pointed analysis of the human faculties and their value.On this is imposed a fourfold correspondence of human faculties (Table 18.7).During his preparation of the Farbenlehre, Goethe corresponded with a young artist, Philipp Otto Runge (1777–1810), who published in the year of his ear-ly death a hand-colored treatise on his Farbenkugel or color-sphere.23 Being Table 18.8 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Farbenlehre (1810)Vernunft (intellect, reason)covers half of the schön and all of the edelVerstand (understanding, knowledge)covers all the gut and half of the nützlichSinnlichkeit (sensitive faculty, sensuality)covers half of the nützlich and all of the gemeinPhantasie (fantasy, imagination)covers all of the unnötig and half of the schönTable 18.7 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Moral-Color attributionsMagenta or Dark RedSchön (Beautiful)Orange or ScarletEdel (Noble)YellowGut (Good)GreenNützlich (Serviceable)Light BlueGemein (Base)Deep BlueUnnötig (Useless)"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Godwin456<UN>2425262724 For Steiner’s color theories and methods, see Mayer, Mystery-Wisdom, Boos-Hamburger, Creative Power, Merry, Art.25 Itten, Art of Color, 115–116.26 Itten, Art of Color, 25.27 See “Itten, Johannes,” in Grove Art Online.in three dimensions rather than the two of previous color-wheels and color charts, it solves many problems at a stroke. At what we might call the south pole is blackness; at the north pole, perfect white. Twelve colors are arranged in spectral order around the equator, each one emerging from its darkest hue (yellow from brown) and graduating through eight stages to its bright-est. As painter and theorist, Runge belonged within the Naturphilosophie of the German Romantic period; his best-known works are the two versions of Der Morgen (Morning, 1808), which are suffused with color symbolism and a Christian-Hermetic concept of the descent of the soul into material existence.A century later, Goethe’s and Runge’s color theory found an enthusiastic reviver in Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925), who edited Goethe’s scientific works.24 Building on those insights, the founder of Anthroposophy developed color ex-ercises for awakening the spiritual faculties, and made these a major part of his educational system. Children in the Steinerian Waldorf Schools work from their earliest years with color alone, in order to retain their prenatal memories of higher worlds. Only after the age of seven or so is drawing in black on white introduced, along with the beginnings of intellectual rather than intuitive and imaginative instruction. Anthroposophic art by adults is easily recognizable for its pastel shades, soft edges, curved lines and tendency to the upper-right direction.While the Waldorf movement in education was spreading throughout Eu-rope, the members of the Weimar Bauhaus were studying color theory un-der the Swiss painter Johannes Itten (1888–1967). His color theory rested on a version of Runge’s color-sphere with twelve tones and seven stages from dark to light25—significant numbers!—and on the correlation of colors with the seasons and with human psychological types. In his influential book The Art of Color he shows portraits of students together with the colors of their choice, and comments that ‘the essential factor is the “aura” of a person’.26 The whole atmosphere of the Bauhaus in its early, spiritually-oriented phase is rather Anthroposophic, though Itten himself was a follower of the Maz-daznan movement, a syncretistic pseudo-Zoroastrian system of meditation and body-culture.27"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"457Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>2828 Gouk, Music, 243–244.3 Newton’s Rainbow and the Indigo ProblemMost people take it for granted that the spectrum has seven colors: Red, Or-ange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet (or the reverse). Fewer are aware that this is an invention of Isaac Newton (1642–1727), prompted by his faith in the doctrine of correspondences. The story is familiar to historians of science. When Newton was experimenting with prisms in his rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge, he asked his assistant, who had better eyesight than he, to mark the divisions in the spectrum. How many should there be? Seven. The Newton scholar and musicologist Penelope Gouk comments, as she takes up the tale:In both the “Hypothesis” and the Opticks this pleasing sevenfold division is presented as though it were objectively determined by experiment. Only in the second draft of his Optical Lectures (written in 1672 but pub-lished posthumously) does Newton offer a more candid reconstruction of events. First he measured the distances between the five main colours to see what might be deduced from this. Then he tried to divide the spec-trum into seven colours, adding indigo and orange to the main colours ‘in order to divide the image into parts more elegantly proportioned to each other’. Only at that point did he find that ‘everything appeared just as if the parts of the image occupied by the colours were proportional to a string divided so it would cause the individual degrees of the octave to sound’. With the benefit of hindsight, such a fit certainly confirmed the parallels between colour and musical harmony. Until Newton found it, the ad hoc process of searching for this connection was surely indistin-guishable from numerology.28Thus was born an anomaly in the history of color theory that, thanks to New-ton’s authority, persists to the present day. A subsequent generation of esoteric philosophers, of whom I give a sample here, embraced the Newtonian septe-nary without question.The social and cosmic theorist Charles Fourier (1772–1837) was debatably “esoteric”, but certainly a devotee of numerology and a believer in the doctrine of universal correspondence.

The curious thing is that a man so independent in his thinking that he would invent his own planetary system was still indebted to Newton’s scale. But this would be the case for several other French esoteric philosophers who followed around mid-century.29The Abbé Paul-François-Gaspard Lacuria (1808–1890), a Christian Herme-tist, writes in his principal work Les harmonies de l’être – The Harmonies of Being (1844–47) of the “marvelous analogies” between the divine attributes, the col-ors, and the tones of the diatonic scale, which he gives as shown in Table 18.10.Note that he aligns the spectral colors with the scale in reverse order to that of Fourier.

It is that the vibration ratios that generate the vis-ible color spectrum cover a little less than an octave, with red as the lowest frequency and violet as the highest. Therefore to align them with a scale from C up to B is a valid, if imaginary transposition into the audible domain. Louis Lucas (1816–1863), a political editor and alchemist who published a Pythago-rean treatise on music in 1849, proposes the same septenary correspondence, observing moreover that the primary colors of Red, Yellow, and Blue give the tonic triad C-E-G.30Lucas was convinced of the scientific validity of such findings, and their po-tential for a synthesis of the disciplines. He writes in his “alchemical romance”:Chemistry, assisted first by mathematics, intelligently understood, hon-estly dwelt on, then by music, whose treasures are still at this very mo-ment sealed with a great seal, will inaugurate an age of marvels in which man will no longer need interpreters in his converse with nature.31Such hopes were common among esotericists of the later nineteenth cen-tury, who saw in their studies the tertium quid that would reconcile religion and science. Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831–1891), co-founder of the Theo-sophical Society, made this the explicit goal of her first book, Isis Unveiled (1877). Later, in her conversations with members of the Blavatsky Lodge, she confirmed the importance of these correspondences, and explained how to discover them:This is the keynote of Occultism, to know the true relation of sounds, colors, and numbers. There are so many. There are seven rays, but what are they? They have got seventy-seven thousand times seven, all kinds of combinations; it takes a lifetime to learn them, and you cannot do it by registering all these in your physical memory. It is a perfect impossibility. You have to use your intuition, and your psychic memory, the memory of your ego, of the astral. You have to register it on your astral form.32Blavatsky treated the subject at great detail in her instructions to the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society.33 What concerns us here is that Newton’s"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Godwin460<UN>3435363734 Blavatsky, Collected Writings, xii, 549.35 Blavatsky, Collected Writings, xii, 548–549n.36 Blavatsky, Collected Writings, xii, 620.37 See Nash, ‘Seven Rays’.seven colors appear in almost all her schemes of correspondence, aligned with the diatonic scale as in Lacuria’s scheme, above. ‘Esotericism,’ Blavatsky writes, ‘recognizes neither black nor white as colors, because it holds religiously to the seven solar or natural colors of the prism’.34 However, she does not leave the indigo problem unresolved. With her seeming access to universal knowledge she footnotes it thus:Indigo is the intensified color of the heaven or sky ... obtained from the indigofera tinctoria, a plant of the highest occult properties in India, much used in White Magic, and occultly connected with copper. This is shown by the indigo assuming a coppery luster, especially when rubbed on any hard substance. Another property of the dye is that it is insoluble in water and even in ether, being lighter in weight than any known liquid. No symbol has ever been adopted in the East without being based on a logical and demonstrable reason. Therefore Eastern symbologists from the earliest ages have connected the spiritual and animal minds of man, the one with dark blue (Newton’s indigo), or true blue, free from green; and the other with pure green.35Also in the spirit of scientific rationalism, Blavatsky offers this justification for the correspondences of colors and tones: ‘Every impulse of vibration of a physical object producing a certain vibration of the air—that is, causing the collision of physical particles, the sound of which is capable of affecting the ear—produces at the same time a corresponding flash of light, which will as-sume some particular color’.36Blavatsky’s esoteric instructions introduced the concept of Rays: seven pri-meval radiations from the creative Logos, each populated by its own hierarchy and identified by a spectral color. The Seven Rays would play a major part in post-Blavatskian Theosophy.37 They were taken up in the 1920s by Charles W. Leadbeater (1854–1934) and by Alice A. Bailey (1880–1949), each claiming in-spiration or dictation from different Theosophical Masters. Bailey’s scheme, developed in her five-volume Treatise on the Seven Rays (1936), has become a commonplace of New Age cosmology and psychology. Its basic components are listed below (Table 18.11)."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"461Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>3839404138 The myth is most readily accessed on Internet sources, beginning with http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/Indigo_children.39 See Pape, Is there a New Race, 27–29.40 VandenBroeck, Al-Kemi, 131–132.41 For an exhaustive analysis of Schwaller’s color theory, see Cheak, “Light Broken through the Prism of Life,” Chapter 4.Of all the later applications of these concepts, the most curious is the 1990s myth of the “indigo children”.38 The belief that some children belong to a future and more spiritual state of humanity had already appeared in neo- Theosophy as “Sixth Root-Race” types (the rest of us being of the Fifth), with many of the same physical and psychological qualities as the Indigos.39 The current term reflects the unique status accorded to the indigo ray in Bailey’s scheme of things, as well as her role in the translation of Blavatskian Theosophy into its exoteric counterpart which is the New Age.Lastly in this section, I turn to a treatment of the indigo problem from an alchemical point of view. It is found in the oral instructions of R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz (1887–1961) to André VandenBroeck (1936–2009). According to the latter, Schwaller spoke thus of Newton’s seven primary prismatic colors:Of these, three are fundamental, namely red, yellow, and blue, and an-other three are the three possible results of one-to-one combinations of the first three ... This leaves the vexing presence of indigo, usually not considered among the fundamental colors ... Indigo is indigo, you cannot obtain it by any mixture.40I do not pretend to understand the long discourse that follows in Vanden-Broeck’s reconstructed verbatim account, which mentions Fulcanelli’s failed experiments and the alchemical tincturing of medieval stained glass.41 But Table 18.11 Alice Bailey, Treatise on the Seven Rays (1936)First RayWill or PowerRedSecond RayLove or WisdomIndigoThird RayActive Intelligence, or AdaptabilityGreenFourth RayHarmony or BeautyYellowFifth RayConcrete Science or KnowledgeOrangeSixth RayDevotion or Abstract IdealismBlueSeventh RayCeremonial Law or MagicViolet"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Godwin462<UN>42434442 VandenBroeck, Al-Kemi, 133 and plate iv.43 ‘Cercle chromatique’, published separately in 1855, using the new technique of chromatography.44 Itten, Art of Color, 35.Schwaller does seem to have regarded indigo as a fourth primary color, exist-ing on the threshold of the realm beyond visible color. ‘Here is where a new red can be born, the red beyond violet, the one that is felt in violet and that disappears into ultraviolet’.42 The problem remains, but it has been raised to a higher plane.4 The Artist’s Colors and the ComplementariesUntil recently, one would search in vain for a tube of Indigo paint, because artists are not, for the most part, Newtonians. They know three primary colors, Red, Yellow, and Blue, whose mixtures, two by two, produce three secondary colors, Orange, Green, and Violet or Purple. Dyers, too, though familiar with indigofera tinctoria, have a practical approach to the mixing of colors. One of these, the dyer-chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul (1786–1889), revolutionized exoteric color theory with the publication of his De la loi du contraste simul-tané des couleurs – On the Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colours (1839). He classified colors not by Newton’s spectrum but by the painter’s primaries and their divisions, but it was his elucidation of the law of “simultaneous contrast” that had a momentous effect. It drew attention to the psychological fact—already touched on by Goethe—that colors are not perceived as they are in themselves, but are affected by the adjacent or superimposed colors, and that the most effective combinations are of complementary colors. For the benefit of dyers, designers and artists, Chevreul provided a wheel of 72 colors, each of whose complementary was to be found diametrically opposite to it.43Chevreul obtained the colors of his wheel by successive division by prima-ries, secondaries, tertiaries (Green–Yellow, etc.) and a further five hues be-tween each of these. Whereas the heraldic tinctures and Newton’s spectrum invite septenary correspondences, and there they stop, in Chevreul’s system colors, like musical pitches, are potentially infinite in number. But 72 is already too many to hold in the memory. The twelve tertiaries seem to be the practical limit, just as musicians are content with twelve chromatic (= colored!) tones to the octave. Johannes Itten, already mentioned, designed a twelve-color ring surrounding the three primaries and three secondaries that is a staple of color theory today.44"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"463Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>4546474845 Guénon, Lord of the World, 42n.46 See Godwin, Music and the Occult, 162–170, for an introduction to the color systems of Jules Swiecianowski, Paul Choisnard, E. Guyot, Maurice Griveau, and Emile Chizat; also an extensive study of Saint-Yves’ correspondence system and the color theory of Charles Henry.47 Saint-Yves, ‘L’Archéomètre’ (partial publication as articles, 1910–12).48 Saint-Yves, L’Archéomètre (complete publication as book, 1912).Six colors were enough for René Guénon (1886–1951), who wrote in Le roi du monde that ‘There are in reality but six colours, complementary two by two and corresponding to the six directions opposed two by two; the seventh co-lour is nothing else than white itself, in the same way as the seventh region is identified with the centre’.45 Guénon’s approach to symbolism owed much to Baron Frédéric Portal’s publication of 1837, Les couleurs symboliques, which used the topic of color symbolism to demonstrate the non-human origin of symbols, their world-wide distribution, and the unity behind the different religious revelations. Portal divided his book into chapters on White, Yellow, Red, Blue, and Green, each treated from the divine, the sacred, and the profane viewpoints; a chapter each on Black and Rose; and a final gathering of Purple, Hyacinth and Scarlet.Chevreul and Portal between them frame the investigations of color in the French occult revival of the fin-de-siècle, divided as it was between a respect for tradition and a desire to reconcile occultism with the new sciences. The period saw repeated and monumental attempts to revive the doctrine of corre-spondences, and to extend Chevreul’s useful color wheel to other disciplines.46 Having treated these elsewhere, I will mention here only Saint-Yves d’Alveydre (1842–1909) and some of his hitherto unpublished ideas.Saint-Yves was the creator of the Archéomètre, a complex, colored diagram that he designated as ‘the key to all the religions and sciences of antiquity and the reformation of all contemporary arts’. The diagram with its associated trea-tise was partially published after his death by René Guénon’s Gnose group,47 then in fuller form under the rival coterie of Gérard Encausse (1865–1916), known in esoteric circles as Papus.48 During its years of preparation, Saint-Yves dithered over whether to use Newton’s seven or the six painter’s colors for his grand synthesis. His decision followed a revelation in 1898, attributed by Saint-Yves to his dead wife, of the significance of the names of Jesus and Mary. He spells each with three Hebrew letters, and gives them the color-correspondences provided in Table 18.12.By further division this yields the twelve colors of the Archéomètre, there represented as four superimposed triangles with the three primaries in"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Godwin464<UN>49505149 See Godwin, ‘Genèse’.50 Saint-Yves, L’Archéomètre, Dorbon edition, 298.

The resources of the Internet yield many reproductions and recreations of this figure, whose genesis I have analyzed elsewhere.49Saint-Yves, like Guyot and others before him, experimented with spinning colors painted on cardboard discs. He writes that when one spins the archeo-metric circle, instead of the grayish white of Newton’s or Chevreul’s discs, ‘one will see the colors composing themselves musically and mutually enlivening themselves, and on this background, the photogenic ray of yellow affirms itself with a power that it seems to lack when the archeometric circle is at rest’.50In his notebooks, Saint-Yves also treats the sexual aspect of this revelation. He writes of how green (the feminine and watery color) receives and extin-guishes the rays of its complementary red (the masculine and fiery color), to-gether producing the white light that is symbolized by the sacred syllable aum. He gives instructions on how to use this word, combined with breathing, dur-ing sexual intercourse, calling it ‘a formidable psychic copulation in which the fire of life extinguishes itself in the cosmic water’.51Originally this word was destined to be pronounced not by the man alone, but by husband and wife, sanctified by their love to the point of holy ecstasy; to the point of the union of souls and spiritual bodies in a Table 18.12 Saint-Yves d’Alveydre, Colours and Names of Jesus and MaryIShU( Jesus)IBlueShYellowURedMRH(Mary)MGreenROrangeHViolet"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"465Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>5253545552 Saint-Yves, notebook, f.69v.53 Saint-Yves, notebook, f.70r.54 Sefer Yetzirah 2:1.

They thus give themselves to one another as two halves of the reflection of the living God and of absolute love.52From this, Saint-Yves passes to a higher level still, with the word IHVH, the name of God in the Mosaic revelation. The letters, he says, correspond as fol-lows: I-Blue, H-Rosy Orange, V-Red. He seems to have in mind the progression from profane (sexual) to sacred love, expressed through color symbolism. I offer a translation for the benefit of those who wish to consider the matter further:Here there is no green extinguishing the red, no fugitive white that falls back via greenish yellow into the violet light of the heart and the gate of men, no mixture of evil and good, or death and life, of the impure and the pure. No more green, the green of the gnostic tree of the scorpion and the cosmic serpent. Such is love, Amour, AOUR. Light, absolute life, eternally radiant and centrifugal so as to give itself to the infinite and bring all to life eternally through IShVa or ihvh.53While Saint-Yves was working on his archeometric synthesis, the members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were also investigating the occult properties and potentials of color. Their royal road also led through Kabbalah, specifically the Sefer Yetzirah or Book of Creation. This early text sorts the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet into 3 mother letters, 7 double letters, and 12 simple letters, indicating many correspondences within each group.54 Thence came the triple sets of colors that appear both on the lamen or pectoral cross worn by Golden Dawn initiates, and on the pastos or coffin which represented the tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz and figured in the initiations of the Second Order.55The Hebrew letters painted on colored backgrounds decorate the two ritual objects (in circular order on the lamen, linear order on the pastos).

Mac-Gregor Mathers (1854–1918) and his wife Moira Bergson Mathers (1865–1928).56So far, the color-systems of the Golden Dawn were merely another set of correspondences. But with their talent for creative synthesis, the Mathers add-ed a practical and most original element. This was the Tattwas and the “flash-ing colors” resulting from them.Strictly speaking, the Tattwas (variously spelled) are the 25 “thusnesses,” the constituents of the manifested universe in the Samkhya system of Hin-du philosophy.57 In 1887–89 an Indian Theosophist, Rama Prasada or Prasad, published in The Theosophist a series of articles that were expanded into a much-read book, usually known as Nature’s Finer Forces.58 These presented the Tattwas as colored symbols of the five elements, each with a characteristic shape (Table 18.13).Blavatsky herself was dubious about Prasada’s work, warning her esoteric stu-dents that its tantric practices could lead to black magic.59 Not so the Golden Dawn, which eagerly fastened onto the Tattwa symbols and their association by Prasada with meditation and breathing exercises. Israel Regardie writes that they were the basis for the Order’s earliest experiments in clairvoyance.60 They exploited the phenomenon of complementary colors and the effects that these Table 18.13 Rama Prasad, Tattwas.AkasaEther or SpiritBlack or IndigoEggVa y uAirSky-BlueDisc or CircleTejasFireRedEquilateral triangleApasWaterSilverCrescentPrithiviEarthYellowSquare or Cube"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"467Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>have on the vision, as documented by Chevreul and other scientific research-ers. Each Tattwa symbol was painted on a background of its complementary color, usually on cards for private use. Here is one exercise:The student should be calm and quiet, and, sitting in his chair, take the card bearing the symbol of the yellow square in his hand, and gaze in-tently at it for about twenty seconds. Quickly transferring his attention from the symbol to any white surface, such as the ceiling, or a sheet of paper at his side especially provided for the purpose, he will see, by reflex optical action, the same shape but in a direct complementary colour. This will be a sort of luminous lavender-blue, or pale translucent mauve ... Immediately this mauve square is seen, the student should close his eyes, and endeavour to visualize in imagination this mauve square as standing before him. This clearly perceived by the mind’s eye, let the student at once imagine that it enlarges itself, becoming an object large enough for him to pass through. The next step is to imagine that he is actually pass-ing through this square, as though it were a door.61So central was the practice with these “flashing colors” that the Mathers used the principle in painting the Order’s first vault in Thavies Inn, London.62 They covered each of the seven interior walls with 40 Kabbalistic, astrological, and alchemical symbols, painted in the colors of the King Scale against back-grounds of the complementary colors.The exercise just described uses a physiological phenomenon, in which the eye projects a color that is not there, to create an imaginal situation. The pur-pose is to enter a realm where vision operates without a physical substratum. Such things happen in dream and drug experiences, but the object of the Gold-en Dawn’s, as of most initiatic training, was to enter such states voluntarily and to control them.A further instruction of the Order states that “Tablets and Telesmas” made in flashing colors enable most students to ‘perceive their flashes of radiance, which are, however, partly subjective and partly objective. They attract and reflect the rays of light from the akashic plane enveloping them’.63 Thus the colors serve as a bridge from the elemental world to whatever lies beyond. 61626361 Regardie, Golden Dawn, iv, 15.62 Howe, Magicians, 82–84, 93–94.63 From Flying Roll no. xi, in Mathers, Astral Projection, 77."},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Godwin468<UN>Whether it is the subtle world, the akashic plane, the astral or etheric, or one of multiple heavens cannot concern us here.5 ClairvoyanceSome investigators, naturally gifted, needed no such training to perceive these worlds. One was Edwin S. Babbitt (1828–1905), an American Spiritualist who founded a new healing discipline, color therapy. In his encyclopedic Principles of Light and Color (1878) Babbitt is not over-concerned with the classification of colors per se; he pictures them as six, twelve, fourteen, and in the undivid-ed spectrum.64 What distinguished his therapy was its use of colored light, in preference to painted colors that only reflect the light shining on them. As scientists were then learning, the two types of color have different primaries and follow different laws. Once he had expounded his therapeutic methods, Babbitt turned to higher octaves of vibrations beyond the visible spectrum; to Baron Reichenbach’s Od or ether with its odic colors, and thence onwards to ‘psychic or third grade colors ... constituted of vibrations which are twice as fine as the odic or four times as fine as those of the ordinary light’.65Central to all of this is Babbitt’s own clairvoyant experience. He describes how in 1870 he began cultivating his interior vision, with signal success:I saw so many grades of violet, and thermel [a Babbitt coinage] and indigo of wonderful depth, and blue, and red, and yellow, and orange, more bril-liant than the sun, seemingly hundreds of different tints, hues, and shades which could be easily distinguished apart, that at first I thought there must be different colors from any that are usually visible, but finally con-cluded that we have the basic principles of all colors in external nature, though so feeble comparatively, that we scarcely know what color is.66At the same time, Babbitt approached his experiences in a scientific spirit. They led him to formulate a theory of the atom, and to draw a diagram of its positive and negative poles and the vortices swirling around it. Whatever its or-igin, this was a very early suggestion in the history of science that the a-tomos, the “indivisible”, has divisions and a complex mechanism within it. Babbitt’s researches would have considerable resonance among the neo-Theosophists.64656664 See the color plates in Babbitt, Principles, frontispiece.65 Babbitt, Principles, 446.66 Babbitt, Principles, 447."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"469Esoteric Theories Of Color<UN>As Blavatsky stated above, the discovery of authentic correspondences is an objective science, though it uses non-physical avenues of perception. To open these is one goal of practical occultism, which was seldom taught in the Western esoteric tradition until demand forced its introduction in the later nineteenth century. Then the early Theosophical Society, the Hermetic Broth-erhood of Luxor, the Esoteric Section, and the Golden Dawn offered such in-struction to select groups.The leaders and instructors were at first coy about their own occult achieve-ments, until Blavatsky’s successor Annie Besant teamed up with Leadbeater to publish the results of their clairvoyant investigations. Spurred by Babbitt’s example, they focused their powers first on the atomic world, publishing the results as ‘Occult Chemistry’ in the periodical Lucifer (November, 1895). Next they turned their attention to the human aura, producing a short book, Thought Forms (1901),67 that Leadbeater quickly supplemented with his own Man, Visible and Invisible (1902).68 In 1905 Thought Forms reappeared in a sec-ond, enlarged edition that became generally known.69 Its paranormal claims apart, art historians recognize the importance of Besant and Leadbeater’s work for its influence on Kandinsky, Mondrian, Malevich, Kupka, and other early abstract artists.70The frontispieces of both books show twenty-five blocks of color, with their meanings. The color printing is not of the best, even for the 1900s, but of the clearly discernible shades Red signifies Anger; Yellow, Highest Intellect; Blue, Pure Religious Feeling; Green, Sympathy; and Orange, Pride. What distin-guishes this from color-symbolism is that the meanings are presented as the authors’ empirical discoveries. The premise is that beside the physical body, humans possess a mental and an astral body that are perceptible to clairvoy-ant vision as auras. In these bodies, ‘Each definite thought produces a double effect—a radiating vibration and a floating form’.71 The color-chart, like the more attractive illustrations in Thought Forms, was compiled by noting the col-ors of people’s auras as they experienced the relevant states of mind.If a clairvoyant is unable to paint what he or she perceives, as was the case with Besant and Leadbeater, it has to be described to someone who can.

At the end of the book are three more artistic plates showing “forms built by music”. The authors explain that ‘sound produces form as well as colour, and that every piece of music leaves behind it an impression of this nature, which persists for some considerable time and is clearly visible and intelligible to those who have eyes to see’.76 Their procedure was to have three types of music played on a church organ, and to view the resultant colors and shapes that emerged above the building. The color plates shows a large late-Gothic church in an idyllic landscape, seen from increasingly distant points. Above it loom the forms generated by music of Mendelssohn, Gounod, and Wagner—the latter’s forms being no less than 900 feet tall.One would like to ask many questions of the authors. First, did Besant and Leadbeater both “see” these apparitions? If so, did they agree in every detail? I suspect that Leadbeater alone was responsible. Then, did he really stand half a mile from the church to witness Wagnerian splendor filling the firmament? He could not have heard the music from there; did he see it emerge the moment the organist struck the ivories? The situation reeks of improbabilities. The only thing of which one can be certain is that at some point, the clairvoyant(s) sat down with the artist and supervised his or her painting. Ordinary patrons in the past have done no less, leaning over the shoulders of the artists in their employ; witnesses instruct police artists in the drawing of a mug-shot. Who is really the artist here?The situation is completely different in Watchers of the Seven Spheres (1933), a book of poems and paintings by H.K.

Also like many of them, she came to occult activity from a position of disbelief and reluctance. Eventually a discarnate “teacher” persuaded her to write, at his dictation, an account of her previous incarna-tions. This became a popular book, The Wheel of Rebirth.A second, artistic phase followed:Later drawings and paintings were given in a rather similar way but here the control was stronger. This was even more impressive to me as they mostly consisted of figures and were very beautiful, whereas it would have been absolutely impossible for me to draw the human figure with any degree of accuracy for I was not a trained artist. The process rather resembled one in which an artist might endeavour to guide the hand of a child.79Finally there came a brief phase in which Mills was put in contact with the deva or angelic kingdom, and it was then that ‘the poems and pictures repro-duced [in Watchers of the Seven Spheres] were precipitated through my hand.’The eight color plates in question show devas (divine or angelic beings), done with water colors in an assured and personal style. The last one is set in a mountain landscape reminiscent of the Russian painter Nicholas Roerich (1874–1947).80 If we believe Mills’s account of herself—and I see no reason to doubt her—then this is not clairvoyance, but a rare case of channeled paint-ing. It raises all the thorny issues associated with channeling, in which a per-son appears to act as mouthpiece, usually through writing or speech, for a source independent of him or herself. These issues include the nature of the source, the possibility of alternate personalities, the creative status of the work 7778798077 See Supplement to the London Gazette, June 8, 1919, 470, accessed online. http://www .london- gazette.co.uk/issues/31114/supplements/470/page.pdf.78 See photograph of Janet Mills, held by the Imperial War Museum, London.

Quail. Somewhat resembling those of Janet Mills, they too conclude with a tribute to Roerich: a painting of The World Mother remarkably similar to his work of the same name and year.81 But Quail, like Leadbeater’s artists, was working under human direction. The Theosophist Geoffrey Hodson (1886–1983) employed her to execute paintings of nature spirits, angels, mountain gods, and devas that he had seen on his world travels in the 1920s, and he did not publish the work until 1952, after Quail had died.These few examples suggest a number of fringe-clairvoyant phenomena, such as synaesthesia, in which a word may have a specific taste, a smell may have a color, or music (as in the famous case of the composer Olivier Mes-siaen) may translate itself into vividly-colored, mobile forms; or the effects of psychedelic drugs, which have their characteristic palettes of colors. Perhaps Leadbeater and Hodson had a gift akin to that of painters like Roberto Matta, Salvador Dali, or Ernst Fuchs, who can produce visions from the imagination alone that put clairvoyantly inspired artists in the shade; but the occultists con-taminated their imaginations with their beliefs and projected them outside—and of course lacked the technique to paint what they saw. Alternatively, some will say that all the great artists are clairvoyant, whether they know it or not.Whatever one’s attitude to these questions, the painting of clairvoyant vi-sions implies another esoteric theory of color, namely that colors exist ob-jectively in non-material states of being. We can all experience non-material colors in rising stages of intensity when (1) we shut our eyes and imagine col-ors; (2) if we dream in color; (3) if we have known the effects of psychedelic drugs, when colors are projected onto the physical sensorium. Reductionist thinking attributes these to the imagination, but clairvoyance posits a further stage in which (4) a non-material plane or state is objectively perceived, and color is characteristic of it. Moreover, clairvoyants like Leadbeater, Hodson, and Steiner give us to understand that paintings by themselves or others are not altogether unfaithful to what they can see there.Many color theorists, and not just esoteric ones, remind us that visible light is only about one octave of the electromagnetic spectrum, and that if our eye-sight had evolved differently, we might see other octaves. Would such octaves have spectra in some way resembling the visible one? Schwaller de Lubicz, 8181 Hodson, Kingdom, plates 28, 29.

I have noticed that present-day efforts to depict the etheric or astral body (of which many can be found on the Internet) favor a deep ultramarine blue or violet, which may be an attempt to capture the Indigo of which Schwaller speaks. The color was much used by Roerich, and became the hallmark color of the modern-ist (and Rosicrucian)82 painter Yves Klein (1928–1962). From a strictly physical point of view, there could be rare cases of sensitivity to electromagnetic wave-lengths beyond the boundaries of visible light, which carry information about electromagnetic processes within the human body. From the occultists’ point of view, those wavelengths could carry information about higher bodies and beings, and, given the occultists’ almost unanimous embrace of the theory of correspondences, it would be natural for them to resemble, albeit in a “higher octave,” the physical color spectrum.This has brought us to a place where physics, occultism, parapsychology, and traditional doctrines could potentially meet, however unlikely such co-operation seems at present. By assembling this brief survey, I hope to have brought some order to the subject, so that any esoteric color theory can be rec-ognized as involving one or more of these approaches: (1) the compilation of correspondences; (2) the search for the origins of color in metaphysical polar-ity; (3) the acceptance of Newton’s septenary as the matrix for speculation; (4) the preference for the artist’s six or twelve colors; (5) the admission of extra-sensory perception on the part of self or others.BibliographyAgrippa, H.C., Three Books of Occult Philosophy, trans.
