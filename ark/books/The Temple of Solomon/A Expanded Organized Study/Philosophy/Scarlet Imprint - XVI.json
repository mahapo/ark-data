Seven steps to divinity which began in Sumeria. But the tower is seen as malefic, under the influ­ence of Mars. A setting above the ignorant masses, the few celebrating penthouse consummations with paid for priestesses, sheer sided watchtowers rising above the prison. Perhaps it has always been so, but this is the age in which the Tower has reached its apotheosis. From the Tour d'Eiffel to the WTC, from Canary Wharf to per­haps the ultimate folly, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai rising above a city built almost at the behest of Ozymandius, this is the age of the Tower, and it's fall. The Tower in our global culture is a symbol of domination rather than spiritual longing for closeness to the Divine. The call to prayer and union has been lost in translation and exegesis as surely as the Koran, the Bible and the Torah have been. Language decays into the repetition of catchphrases for brands whose deep structure is devoid of meaning. We are, as Banksy has sprayed, One nation Under CCTV, drones imprisoned in the perfected form of Bentham's panopticon. Our emails are read, our searches recorded, our phonecalls intercept­ed, our urine blood and saliva swabbed and sequenced by the latest incarnation of the witchhunters. The Devil, we are told, is long­bearded and swarthy, but his accomplices may look just like us. The message we are fed is trust no-one. It is the corporation and the state that does what it will. Dystopia is here, not simply as Orwell's human face being stamped upon forever, but in a triumph of newspeak where freedom means consumption, democracy is a choice between Pepsi or Coca-Cola, and hard won liberties are willingly seceded under the abstract threat of terror.

The response has been sixteen and one essays from very different writers. Those that have taken up the challenge range from Chaos magicians to Druids to Typhonians and independents. Sexual and chemical adventurers are found alongside aeonic speculators and collapsetarians. This gathering of artificers is a sign of growing diversity, rather than a magick which is trapped in fundamental­ist ghettos, divided and dwindling into cloddish entropy. It is the generosity of spirit in our writers which makes this possible, a choosing to act rather than simply talk. To engage with the past is safe, to dare to confront our times and to walk into the future is infinitely more dangerous. In opposition to the Tower we raise the image of the maypole. A living symbol on a human scale. An image of resistance. Dancers weave around, attached to it by umbilical ribbons rather than iso­lated and alienated by insurmountable walls. We are diverse and yet intimately connected in community. May Day is a euphoric and revolutionary event. It is this artistic spirit which promises endless acts of creation coming out of destruction. Matter is re-energised and created anew. We do not have to sit mournfully in the ruins of consumerism. But May Day is not for the faint of heart, scores are settled when the existing order is turned on its head. Wrongs are righted as power shifts to the dancers and revellers rather than those who cannot, or will not move. The green spring rises from the red blood of a revolution in consciousness. The XVl'h house is War, a warning to those who would wall themselves up in their towers that all the occult secrets we need to know are contained in the fluid plasma of lightning. Kings cast down break their crowns on the cobblestones. We dip the hems of our robes in their blood and write fresh symbols which transcend the babel of mere words. You cannot stand outside this process, this revolution. May Day engulfs the spectators in misrule and mania and transforms them. By the mere possession of this book, you too are implicated.

The latter is far and away the more popular of the two, for good reason: irony is explosive stuff, especially when it weaves itself into the unquestioned assumptions of a cul-ture or a subculture. Nowadays the occult scene is awash in unrecognized irony. Many occultists today see themselves as innovators boldly taking magic where it has never gone before. Many others see themselves as defenders of some unchanging tradition from the past. Both sides claim to be rebels against the existing order of things. The irony begins here, as it's hard to think of a theme more hardwired into the existing order of things than the hackneyed pseudo-de­bate between a supposedly innovative present and a supposedly static past. In all its many manifestations - and few corners of contempo­rary culture lack them - this nonquarrel conceals, behind a con­ventional facade of rebellious originality, an unquestioning alle­giance to the basic presuppositions of modern thought. The most important of those presuppositions concern what we may as well call the shape of time. Philosophers have suggested that deep-ocean fish have no aware­ness of the water in which they live, since they have nothing with which to contrast it. Whether or not they are right about the fish, this is certainly true about the way most human beings relate to the way time is defined for them by their culture. In traditional China, for example, time had a circular shape; every rise was followed by a fall, and and every fall by a rise; at every moment, the cycles of time lined up like the cylinders in a combination lock, and the combination might be deduced and the lock picked by someone learned in the I Ching, the primary Chinese text of time theory. For thousands of years this way of thinking was so deeply ingrained in Chinese society that it rarely had to be mentioned, and it was only when Europeans arrived and imposed their own very different vision of time by force that time lost its shape. Pass from traditional China to aboriginal Australia and time changes shape completely; Chinese time moves in circles, but aboriginal time doesn't move at all. The time that matters is the Dreamtime, when everything real happened, or happens, or will happen - the Dreamtime exists equally in the past, the present and the future. Aboriginal bands performed their increase ceremonies"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"XVI to tap into the always-existing Dreamtime for their own benefit and that of the land. According to archeologists, the aboriginal shape of time remained firmly in place for thousands of years, until European ships arrived with a new kind of time and the fire­power to make it the only time that mattered. The same thing happened to shapes of time around the world as Europeans surged out of their crowded peninsula on the west end of Asia and spread themselves at gunpoint around the world. Of all the dubious imports they brought with them - gunpowder, venereal diseases, Christianity -their shape of time may well have caused the most destruction. The shape of time may seem like sheer abstraction, but then water probably seems that way to fish. Flip the fish out of water and the concrete nature of that seem­ing abstraction becomes brutally apparent. For millions of people dragged out of their own times and forced into the alien time of the West, the experience was not very different. This needs to be remembered just now, because time can change its shape for reasons other than the arrival of invaders from over­seas. It can also change if the gap between the shape of time de­fined by a culture and the shape that's experienced by people with­in that culture becomes too wide to be bridged. The opening of just such a gap is well under way in the modern industrial world; in the decades just ahead of us, it will become impossible to ignore. HOW CAN A FISH LEARN to be aware of water? This is becoming a crucial question as the certainties of today's industrial cultures crumble beneath them. Most of us have not yet learned to see the shape of time that surrounds us, precisely because it surrounds us so totally. That unseen shape is also the central myth of our age. To call it that is to run afoul of deeply entrenched biases. The claim that past societies had myths but ours does not is among the credos of con­temporary culture. There are even books claiming that am!}tbia, the pathological lack of myths, causes many of the ills of moderni­ty.' Once again, though, we are deep in irony. Our society's prob­lems have many roots but a myth deficiency is not among them. It is of course true that the myths of Christianity and Judaism no longer command the belief of most people. Even among those who sl ill make weekly trips to churches, myths and symbols that once inspired martyrs to die with prayers on their lips have generally I 1\\11 example is Loyal n.

Still, this did not happen because people stopped believing in myths; it happened because they abandoned their old myths for a more appealing one, the myth of progress. Most people nowadays, even when they cling to the symbols of older faiths, believe that human history traces a straight line from the squalor of a primitive past to the grandeur of a Promethean future. Most people assume that by definition, newer opinions are more true and newer practices more effective than older ones, and old ideas and approaches are not just made unfashionable but dis­proved by the passage of time. Magicians are by no means immune to such logic; as already mentioned, a sizeable subset of today's magical scene likes to think of itself as cutting-edge innovators whose theories and practices are better than the magic of the past, for no better reason than that they are newer. A thought experiment can help show just how much emotional power the myth of progress wields. Imagine, then, that the con­temporary faith in progress turns out to be based on a simple misunderstanding. The triumphs of the last three centuries were made possible, let's say, not by some grand trajectory of progress, but simply by the exploitation of the Earth's fossil fuel reserves. The fantastic amounts of energy mined and pumped from the earth enabled the world to enjoy an unparalleled economic boom. the Age of Exuberance, in which the limits that bound all other societies were temporarily lifted by a glut of cheap fuel.' Today, to continue the thought experiment. all the factors that gave rise to the Age of Exuberance are going or gone. and a mas­sively overpopulated world is rushing to extract what remains of the coal. oil. and natural gas that made industrial society possible. Assume, for the sake of the experiment. that none of the proposed replacements for fossil fuels can make up the difference. The fu­ture facing us then is not a vista of endless progress. but a difficult retreat to the world as it was before 1700. with no hope of another Age of Exuberance to come. Even to imagine this future as a reality is to confront the myth of progress head on. It can be an extremely uncomfortable experi­ence. Take a moment to think it through. Picture our civilization winding down, technologies abandoned because no one can spore the energy and raw materials to keep them working, the scien­tific discoveries of the recent past reduced to historical curiosities. 1 The phrase /lge of Exubmmn' is from William Calion, Oversho\"t: .,.hl' I:w/ogica/ Basis of lil'vo/lltilm<lrl!

Imagine the footprints on the moon fading into legend. Imagine the stars forever out of reach. If your first reaction is that this can't possibly happen, set that aside and imagine that it has. If your second reaction is that people will inevitably find some way to get progress back on track set that aside as well; imagine that rapid technological progress turns out to have been an exotic phenomenon fostered by one set of rare historical conditions, and that the millennia of technological standstill before the Age of Exuberance are matched by millennia more of stasis or slow decline after it. Think about what the human situation looks like from this per­spective. In such a world, people will still live, love, struggle, a nd practice magic, but they will do so as their ancestors did, in a world tied closely to the rhythms of nature and the harsh requirements of a subsistence economy. Does that destiny make the story of hu­man existence meaningless? For many people nowadays, it does. That is what happens when a myth dies - or, to use the language already proposed in this essay, when time loses its familiar shape. WHAT MAKES THIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT even more uncomfort­able is that a great deal of evidence suggests that it is not a fantasy. This evidence has been explored at great length in many recent books, and need not be repeated here; the curious can consult the sources listed in the notes.3 The core of the case these books make is that fossil fuels con­tain more cheap, abundant, readily accessible energy that anything else humanity has within reach; they exist in limited quantities; and they are being extracted from the Earth at a breakneck pace, several times the rate at which new deposits are being discovered. No other energy source available to us can replace them in any meaningful sense, and as they run short, a global industrial and 3 See Catton, op. cit.; John Michael Greer, The Long Descent: A User's Guide to the End of the Industrial Age (zo08); Richard Heinberg, The Parhis Over: Oil.

The 'lltel'lllltive technologiL's now bl'ing touted ns replncements for fossil fuels, these stud ies show, nre actually dependent on fossil fuels themselves. Nobody uses wind power, for ex.lmple, to l11anu­facture wind turbines; electrici ty 1'1'0111 coal and natural gns powers the factori es, and diesel fuel 1'1'0111 oil wells powers t he trucks that transport the turbines and the machinery that installs them. For that matter, today's wind turbines cannot be l11ade or operated without plastics and lubricants derived from petroleum, as well as rare earth elements that can only be mined and processed in use­ful quantities because vast amounts of cheap energy can be poured into the process. Add up all the fossil fuel inputs that go into wind power, and it's not unfair to call a wind turbine a roundabout way to convert fossil fuels into energy, with a little additional boost from the wind. You will not hear perspectives like this in the circles where wind power is being touted as the answer to our energy problems. Nor, though the same points could be made about other energy alterna­tives from solar cells to fusion power, will you hear them raised in those contexts. The working assumption that dominates nearly all discussions of energy today is that the universe has to con­tain something newer, bigger, and better than fossil fuels, so that progress can continue unchecked. It's unthinkable to many people that fossil fuels may be the best energy source our species will ever know, and that when they are gone, we will have to make do with the same far more limited sources our great-great-grandparents used. The resulting effort to avoid thinking about the unthinkable has backed important elements of the alternative energy scene into embarrassing corners. Consider the recent ethanol debacle in the United States. Prominent environmentalists hit on ethanol made from American corn as the wonder fuel that would save the day. They found plenty of support, not least from farm state politicians interested in scoring with their constituents and stock market mavens hoping to cash in on the next stock bubble. Nobody took the time to figure out if ethanol from corn would actually make money, or produce more energy than it consumed, and as it turned out, it couldn't do either one. Across America's farm belt, as a result, abandoned ethanol fac­tories have become another gravestone marking the slow death of the American dream. Meanwhile, biodiesel from algae has 5"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"XVI replaced ethanol as the fantasy fuel du jour, and money is current­ly being poured into schemes with economic prospects even more dubious than the failed ethanol plants.4 When those schemes fail, as they will, there will be others. There have to be others, because the alternative is to accept that Nature is under no obligation to hand us a new energy source to replace the fossil fuels we have wasted so profligately over the last three hundred years. All the money and effort being wasted on such pursuits could be put to work cushioning the decline and making sure that at least some of the useful legacies of our age get passed to the future. Excepting a few projects run on shoestring budgets by individuals and groups on the fringes of society, this is not happening. The power wielded by the shape of time shows itself here as well. In any culture, the shape of time determines what people are able to imagine about the future, even when what is imaginable does not include what is happening around them. THE MYTH OF PROGRESS is not quite the only force shaping con­temporary expectations about time and the future. An older myth, inherited from the culture that modern industrial society sup­planted, still has followers of its own. This myth defines the shape of time in its own way, and it also has a clearly defined social role nowadays; in the stereotyped debates between progress and tradition mentioned at the beginning of this essay, it provides the losers. The alternative myth has roots deep enough in our culture that everyone reading this essay knows it well enough to recite it in their sleep. There was, this myth claims, a time before his­tory when human beings lived at peace with themselves and their world. Then some terrible event ended paradise; history began, and brought all the miseries and evils that have afflicted us ever since. After countless years of suffering, truth burst forth in a re­deeming revelation, and a wise and fortunate few gathered around the banner of truth to defend it against the gargantuan powers of a corrupt and dying world. The next act in the drama, which will arrive any day now, is a cataclysmic change in which the old world will be swept away forever, paradise will be restored, history will come to a full stop, and nothing important will ever change again. 4 See Krassen Dimitrov's Green Fuel Technologies: A Case Studp for Industrial I'hotospnthctic Encrgp Capture (www.nanostring.net/Algae/CaseStudy.pdf). which documents that algal biodiesel using currently available technolo· gil'S will only Illake Illoney if diesel fuel costs $800 a gaHon. h"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MAGIC & THE END OF HISTORY The only thing that makes this myth hard to see as a single pattern is that the names of the characters change from version to version. In the Christian version, the original paradise was Eden, the terri­ble event was Original Sin, the redeeming revelation was the life of Jesus, the fortunate band battling a corrupt world is the Christian church, and the next act in the drama is Armageddon, followed by the Second Coming and the New Jerusalem. In the Marxist ver­sion, the original paradise was primitive communism, the terrible event was the invention of private property, the redeeming revela­tion was Marxism, the fortunate band is the Communist party, and the next act is revolution, followed by socialism and the transition to Communism. In the radical Pagan feminist version, the original paradise was ancient matriarchal society, the terrible event was the invasion of the patriarchal Indo-Europeans, the redeeming revelation was Marija Gimbutas' speculations, the fortunate band is contemporary feminist Paganism, and the next event is the fl311 of patriarchy and the rise of a partnership societp in which women will be just that little bit more equal than men, and so on. The diversity of labels for the elements of the myth do nothing to counter its underlying unity. The shape it gives to time is a straight line segment with a beginning, an end, and half a dozen clearly defined points in between. The present moment is one of those; those who believe that myth and inhabit the shape of time it defines are always living on the eve of the apocalypse, just before the rising spiral of conflict between the chosen few and the cor­rupt institutions of a doomed but powerful system explodes into its final. fateful. and utterly predictable finale. Thus it has exercised a potent magnetism on radicals on all sides of the political continuum since the dawn of the industrial age, as it allows them to see their protests against authority, however unimpressive these may be, as the beginning of the ultimate strug­gle against evil. It also encourages radicals to fulfill the role as­signed them by contemporary society, which is to lose. It's worth noting that those radical movements that accomplish their goals, such as the Civil Rights movement of the 1950S and 1960s or the first two waves of American feminism, are consistently those that steer clear of apocalyptic rhetoric. Those movements that embr!lce apocalyptic rhetoric just as consistently fail. It's hard to say why insisting that the world will cr!lsh into ruin unless your movement gets its way should be the kiss of denth for radical movements, but the track record extends to nil sides of the political continuum. Consider the abject failure of Christian 7"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"XVI fundamentalism to force its moral vision on society. Despite half a century of efforts backed up by levels of popular support and funding that dwarf most left-wing movements, the fundamental­ists have yet to get any major piece of their agenda enacted into law, or even manage more than occasional delays in points as fatal to their crusade as the legal recognition of gay marriage. It's any­one's guess which way the arrows of cause and effect run between this litany of failure and the fundamentalist obsession with the End Times, but the correlation is hard to miss. The rapid spread of apocalyptic beliefs throughout the activist left in recent years is thus not a promising sign. Still, there is an­other and, at least potentially, a far more serious problem with the popularity of such beliefs all through contemporary society. The myth of progress and the myth of apocalypse both impose a distinctive shape on time, and define specific expectations for the future. The problem is that neither of these myths anticipate a future anything like the one we are most likely to get. CIVILIZATIONS FALL. This is one of the most predictable things about them. What is too rarely noticed is that every civilization known to history traces the same general trajectory on its way to history's dumpster: a long, ragged process of crisis, contraction, and repeated attempts at partial recovery extending over one to three centuries.s This is not the way most people today expect civilization to end. Hundreds of otherwise forgettable Hollywood disaster epics have taught us that the fall of our civilization will take place in the two-hour window between opening and closing credits, with spe­cial effects courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic. The myth of apocalypse in all its many forms assumes the same thing; Jesus or proletarian revolution or some other messianic force shows up with the biggest possible flash and bang, and by the time the rubble stops bouncing the old world is gone forever. The myth of progress assumes that civilization can only get better, but agrees that whatever the future brings, it has to be bigger, brighter, and louder than the past. As the pressures of resource depletion and environmental deg­radation have begun to bite in recent decades, these three currents of thinking about the future have interbred with all the coy re­luctance of minks in heat.

My favorite example just now is Ray Kurzweit who got the fifteen minutes of fame Andy Warhol predicted the future would give everyone by rewriting Protestant fantasies of the Rapture in the language of bad science fiction.6 Kurzweil's pop theology centers on the Singularity, the im­minent point - like all apocalypses, it's always just about to hap­pen - when science will know everything that matters and human beings become omnipotent. Once this happens, he insists, we'll all upload our identities into immortal robot bodies and go soaring off the planet to enjoy the good life forever in deep space. Replace space with heaven, robot bodies with the Resurrection, and the Singularity with the Second Coming, and the narrative is instantly familiar; it's precisely Kurzweil's lack of originality that makes him so entertaining. He's not alone in attempting to tell an apocalyptic story using the language of the myth of progress, either. That sort of mingled myth was mapped by a great many people onto the Y2K nonproblem; an entire industry now exists to project it onto the inkblot patterns of the Mayan calendar; when the next baktun begins without incident on 21\" December 2012, no doubt, some new target for the mythology will be found. The end of the Age of Exuberance has provided an ample ex­cuse for the same exercise, and those who read their way through current speculations on peak oil will find their share of sudden evolutionary leaps to a Utopian world, overnight cataclysms that send hordes of zombified urbanites across the landscape to provide target practice to survivalists, and so on. It's interesting to watch the logic of myth that runs all through these accounts, dismissing all the more likely outcomes so that the future can be forced onto the Procrustean bed of our culture's preferred ways of thinking about the future. Fusing the myths of progress and apocalypse is easier than it looks, because a common theme unites them: both are myths of the end of historp. According to the myth of apocalypse, history is what happens between the Fall and the Second Coming, or whatever their equivalents happen to be; once evil is vanquished, history stops and nothing significant ever changes again. According to the myth of progress, in turn, history as we have known it is already over; now that we have outgrown the errors and superstitions of the past, we can expect a future of endless improvement in which even the most overwhelming crisis will merely speed up the poce <> Ray KlIrzweil.

Just below the surface of this insistence on history's end, it's not hard to sense the paralyzing dread of the future that drives it. Civilizations in decline very often experience this sort of terror of history; they see time itself as a trap closing around them, and flail about for some means of escape. As classical civilization fal­tered, mystery cults that promised a salvation outside of time grew strong, and then were swallowed up by a religion that promised an end to time not only for the individual initiate but for the entire world. Where the temples of the Roman gods faced outwards, em­bracing the community and its history, Christian churches turned inward and knelt behind closed doors as they prayed for time to end. Religious people like to claim that all prayers are answered, but the only response this one received was a resounding No. Neither the Second Coming nor anything else saved the Roman world from its own mistakes. Instead, classical civilization stumbled down the slow arc of descent into history's dumpster, and the barbarian tribes that swarmed in to fill the vacuum founded new nations and histories of their own. Two thousand years from now, some future essayist may de­scribe the decline and fall of the American empire in similar terms. Long before that happens, though, those who cling to the hope that history will stop are likely to find out the hard way that it will not do so soon enough to keep them from experiencing the future that they most fear. THE QUESTION THAT WILL BE ASKED by a great many people then, and may have risen in the minds of some of this essay's readers already, is how to replace the myths with knowledge of the true shape of time. Plausible though it sounds, it's the wrong question to ask. Cultures down through the ages have come up with a dizzy­ing assortment of myths to give shape to time, and each one seems to work about as well, and about as poorly, as any of the others. Our competing myths of progress and apocalypse are no more true than the Chinese myth of time's complex circles or the Aboriginal myth of the eternal Dreamtime of which all earthly events are pal­lid reflections.

There's a sense, in fact, in which magic is to myth what engineering is to science: the practical application of patterns that span and shape the universe as a whole. Thus the question that magicians might usefully ask themselves is not what shape time has, but what shape they might be able to give it. If the view of the future offered in this essay is anything like accurate, we face one to three centuries of decline, ending in a world with roughly the same energy resources and technologi­cal options as the one our ancestors knew. That future does not define the whole shape of time, and any number of myths could make sense of the curve of decline in their own terms. All that is needed to work magic with time is a recognition that time's shape is up for grabs. Not that long ago, many occultists knew as much, and defined the shape of time in their own ways. Most practitioners of magic these days have heard of Aleister Crowley's theory of aeonic cycles, in which one dominant spiritual influence after another, proclaimed at intervals by a qualified Magus, holds the planet in thrall.\" Fewer know that William Butler Yeats, a Golden Dawn alumnus like Crowley, crafted a far more subtle theory of historical cycles as part of his masterpiece of magical philosophy A Vision.\" Other ex­amples are easy to find; all through the magical revival of the late 19th and early 20th century, it was a rare occultist or magical order that didn't have a distinctive vision of time on offer. It became fashionable some decades ago to dismiss this sort of thing as pointless clutter, a kind of Victorian architectural ginger­bread unsuited to the gleaming Bauhaus constructions of up-IO­date magic. Magical narratives of time went into the same duslbin of collective memory as, say, the colorful accounts of Atlantis and 7 Quoted in W. E. BUller, Magic: Its Hitual, Power and Purpose, p. 12.

The parallel is exact; I have argued else­where that the Atlantis myth was resurrected by 19th century oc­cult lodges in a subtle effort - too subtle, one gathers, for more recent mages - to introduce certain ideas about the morality of science and the future of society into the collective conversation of their time.'O The same deeper context can be found, with a little effort, in old occult literature about time and the future. It's easy to dismiss the gaudy furniture of rings and rounds and future histories as so much nonsense, not least because the prophecies of the near fu ture included in them have proven far more often than not to be wildly inaccurate. Still, look past the clutter and trace the shape of time outlined in these ornate narratives, and it's often possible to glimpse what the occultists of an earlier age meantto accomplish with them, sometimes hijacking the standard myths of progress or apocalypse, sometimes contradicting them flatly or offering tempt­ing glimpses of other ways of understanding the shape of time. It may be usefuL in other words, to revisit the dusty tomes that so many of us dismissed out of hand in the wake of the Sixties, and learn to see past the ornate forms of an earlier age to the potent tools they embody. Whether or not they choose to draw on these resources, mages and occultists might be wise to scrap the secondhand versions of the end of history that infest today's occult community, and replace them with a livelier sense of the ways that they might ride history's winds, or even shape them. In the proc­ess, they might also put some thought into ways in which the rich magical legacies of the present might best be handed on to a future very different from the ones that believers in the end of history have encouraged us all to expect.

I read this out and it provoked a strong reaction from a person nearby, which resulted in a conversation along the following (abridged) lines. ANGRY PERSON: What a load of bullshit! Why do they pay these wankers to research what is patently bloody obvious? ME: Is it really so obvious? What about people who say they hate smoking but cannot stop? A.P.: They obviously get enough pleasure from a cigarette that they want to keep smoking.

Or dreamers whose schemes never take off? A.P.: You can be sure they get some sort of kick out of it, wanting to get sympathy as a victim, or needing to be the rescuer, or whatever ... ME: So, you insist that it is patently obvious and undeniable that no-one ever does repetitive actions without in some measure gaining pleasure from them? A.P.: Absolutely! ME: That is interesting. Because my memory of the day that planes flew into the World Trade Center was of the pictures of the burning towers that were shown over and over again on the news all day, and that people, including me. watched them over and over again. That would add up to an awful lot of pleasure, not just in the USA but all round the world.

A.P.: That was different. 14"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"XXXII I never really found out why it was different, why this repeated ac­tion broke an otherwise universal rule - because in those days the penalty for saying anything about 9-11 that did not fit the accepted script, was to be accused of being a terrorist sympathiser. So the conversation ended and I was left with a mystery. No, actually, it was not such a mystery, because I could recall the pleasure I myself felt that day. Firstly the aesthetic pleasure: the towers looked so much better with smoke coming out of them, that I guess the architect must have wished he had thought of it first. (Or maybe he had, maybe his buildings were deliberately designed as two fingers raised to the airspace expressing the invitation: c'mon, make mM daM!) Then came something close to sheer curiosity, a sense akin to Mippeee! some interesting news has happened at last! This surely must be what the media were thinking. I do recall one journal­ist later admitting in private conversation that 9-11 was: Brilliant! the best thing since the daM Diana Princess of Wa les snuffed it, but I have never seen such feelings admitted in the news stories - even though they must have been rubbing their hands with glee and thinking ahead to the \"one week. .. \" \"one month ... \" \"one hundred days ... \" \"one year after\" and umpteen other anniverseries that would keep this story running and running. As details of how the attack was achieved began to emerge, I felt a new pleasure - the joy that a small group of determined indi­viduals armed with nothing but a craft knife and their wits could actually take on The System and score a significant victory. At this point I must pause in my narration and address those whose hands have shot up in horror that I could be so evil and \"inhuman\" as to feel pleasure at the suffering and death of nearly three thousand innocent people. I'm sorry, did I say that it was the suffering and death of inno­cent people that gave me such pleasure? Not at all, the pleasure came from a visual spectacle, from news outside the ordinary, and from the thought that the individual could impact The System. I had yet to assimilate the extent of the agony behind that spectacle. Far from being inhuman in my detachment, I was in the all-too­human state of denial. I recall as a schoolboy that my fa ther died suddenly and unexpectedly from a stroke, and how uneasy I fe lt because I was not crying as a result. But adults reassured me thnt it would take weeks or even months fo r me to really believe what had happened, and that the tears would come later. They were right.

It is hard to grasp such enormities. Far from being inhuman in my denial, I felt that those politi­cians and spokespersons who came out the same day with polished speeches of sympathy and condemnation were less human than myself. They came across like looters - raiding the debris and car­nage for any scraps that could be exploited to boost their image and reinforce their political status. It was the best thing that had ever happened for politicians like George Bush who cashed in on the crisis to boost their popularity. Although Bush never acknowl­edged this debt, he did at least take steps to repay Al Quaeda by removinge their Sunni enemies from power in Iraq. Anyway, that is a diversion. The point of this essay is not to go over the well-worn and deeply mined paths of suffering, but to address the less familiar topic of why 9/11 gave, and continues to give, so much pleasure to people in America and the West. And why the young men who gave their lives to deliver such pleasure have not been celebrated for it in the Western media.

The World Trade Center was a fine symbol of The System. Nor was it just a symbol, it actually housed many of the fat cats whose money, power and influence shape our society. How deeply satisfy­ing to think that two or three determined individuals armed with no more than a craft-knife and their wits could hit back at those bastards to so great an effect! Little wonder that so many people can watch the results of that day's handiwork over and over, and that - nine years after the event - the all-time best selling post­cards on the streets of New Yo rk continue to be the ones showing those burning towers. The pigs who gorge themselves at our expense think that their bodyguards, surveillance systems, security gates and private estates put them well out of reach of the common herd they trample upon. They see themselves as magnificent fungal excrescences feeding upon the decaying structure of a society that rots beneath them -held safely out of reach by the barriers they install. They believe they are immune from the outrage they invoke in the masses, that they alone are individuals with the power to choose. It would be very hygienic for such people to face the fact that every time they make some little person angry they could be set­ting off a human time bomb of outrage that might one day explode and destroy them. Such knowledge might even make them pause and think about the broader consequences of their actions. Let us celebrate the so-called Tall Poppy Syndrome. It is not that every tall poppy should be cut down, but simply that the knowl­edge that it can happen might help them think carefully about the means they use to become tall, and how they use their advantage of height for good or ill. What would it take?

Wouldn't it be healthy for our society and the well-being of the planet if anyone and everyone in a position of power felt they were surviving on the edge of a volcano where every step must be taken with the utmost care and consideration?

THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY IN THUNDERSQUEAK IT WAS SUGGESTED that the dilemma of the Age of Aquarius could be the fact that Leo was the opposing sign across the zodiac, and could therefore playa shadow role: Leo the kingly individual against the all-encompassing humanitarian em­brace of Aquarius. The Individual versus Society, or The System. It is ironical, yet typical, that I am celebrating the power of the angry individual to strike back against the might of the system we live in, when the people running the system see themselves as the only true individuals, lording it over the undifferentiated masses beneath. So let us consider a different example: the school-kid who feels isolated from the other pupils, the lonely geek who decides to win significance by taking a gun to school, a church, or a shopping mall and killing as many people as possible before being stopped. This has happened in several countries, with or without gun controls, but it is still mostly an American hobby - hence the pop­ular saying It isn't guns that kill, it's Americans. Nevertheless, the idea has a certain universal appeal: one morning you wake up a nobody -jeered at by the jocks, ignored by the girls, dismissed by the teachers - but by the end of the day you will be the most famous person in the school. You will be a global celebrity. That'll teach them. They'll be sorry. Don't push this individual too far! What is this sense of significance, of celebrity, that becomes so precious that it it is worth killing, and getting killed, to win it? I have sometimes illustrated a change in our relationship to society, and the universe, as a change from being a cog in the machine to a drop in the ocean. In the past, in feudal times for example, we were all cogs in the machine with definite roles stamped on us by society. The village blacksmith was the village blacksmith and had no way of becoming a nobleman or re-training as a scribe. Even the local squire was locked into a pattern of duties and priviledges that gave little room for change. So there was little sense of individuality, of freedom to be oneself and make personal decisions. On the other hand, you knew exactly who you were and why you were significant. Without the blacksmith, or the squire, the village would suffer. In those 18"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"XXXII societies, even the humblest role had a clear value and could not easily be refilled before the development of a mobile workforce. That is much less true today. Now the individual feels more like a drop in the ocean of humanity. Think of the single drop of water suspended above an ocean. It is like a tiny gleaming lens: look closely and you see the en­tire ocean mirrored in that tiny lens, for it is a microcosm of the whole . .(\\nalyse that one drop in a laboratory with the best scien­tific equipment and you can discover the chemical and physical properties of the entire ocean, for they all exist within that single drop. As an individual I know that my DNA is as good as anyone else's. Leading politicians, top filmstars, award-winning artists and bil­lionaires may have developed certain abilities more than me, but look close enough and you could barely tell the difference between myself and them. I'm as good as they are and yet, drop me into the ocean, and I am utterly insignificant. Unlike the cog in the machine, I have no irreplaceable role. Snuff me out and the ocean wouldn't even notice, let alone suffer my loss. In the ocean of humanity, I am nobody. But if I take a gun into a public place and kill and kill, I make a splash.

RAGE ON THE SCREEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS I'VE SEEN three films on television that set me thinking along these lines: The Assassination of Richard Nixon, The Killing of John Lennon, and Libertll Stands Still. The first two were based on fact, the third was fiction. In The Assassination of Richard Nixon, Sean Penn plays a real loser. We see him failing in his salesman job and in his life. He's a pathetic character, too feeble to really win our sympathy, but we cannot totally dismiss him because what drives him is an exagger­ated sense of honesty. Among his failings as a salesman, his refusal to lie means he cannot play the role demanded, even as a game. But, instead of being nourished by this sense of honour, he grows bitter at its consequences. He begins raging against the liars who run this world - people like President Nixon. He steals his one true friend's pistol - ironical for a man who thinks himself so honest -and sets out to assassinate Richard Nixon. But, like everything else in his life, he bungles it. Having used some skill and intelligence to get through security with his pistol, in the plane he panics, shoots a couple of innocent people and finally dies himself. The story is based on fact and rings true, because it is so like those local shoot-out stories. A few innocent people killed, a loser makes the headlines, a flutter of posthumous fame and that is all. The only thing that puzzles me about these killers is how few lives they take. Surely with a gun, with careful planning and the ele­ment of surprise, anyone could take out tens of people, not just one or two? And there are even better weapons available, like cars loaded with petrol- why not kill hundreds and really make a name for yourself? Do they value their own selves so little that they are prepared to squander it all for a minor news story? The Killing of John Lennon might seem superficially similar. An angry young man - not such a total loser as before, but not really going anywhere - becomes obsessed with a moral cause. Similar to the previous example's crusade for \"honesty\", this man rages 20"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"XXXII against \"phonies\" and decides that John Lennon is the ultimate example and decides to shoot him. From there, the story is a bit ditferent. Instead of a desperate act of rage, this man plans more carefully and studies his subject, his patterns of movement and hehavio,ur. After some false starts - unlike the previous example he knows when to pull back and wait a better opportunity - he �ucceeds and kills John Lennon. He does not shoot himself, he sim­ply waits to be arrested and spends the rest of his life in solitary l'llntinement, because the authorities reckon he would not be safe l1Iixing with the other prisoners. This film is also based on truth, and I assume it is fairly accurate lll'rHuse it is based on the killer's detailed diary. The diary included words along the lines I suggested: just wait till tomorrow, I'll be fU l1Ious. After the event he writes something like: I have not just ki//\" li /ohn Lennon, I have brought an era to its end. While I can admire his dedication, I reject his cause, because I PI'I'sllnally liked the era he set out to finish - not that I believe that Ill' alone achieved its demise. Like most people, I would rather that Ihl' killer had died and John Lennon had lived on. On the other hl1nt!, unlike the previous character, he did keep his cool and com­pit'II' Ihe job, without killing innocent passers-by or himself in the 1\"'tll'l'S�, And he did mark a major change to the lovely era that so rlll'I1t:l'd him.

TIll' Ihird film, Libertp Stands Still, scores high on both counts hUI hns Ihe advantage of being fiction, not tied down to historical Irlllh, II is a very intriguing film, with some experimental touches .1I1'h liN IIsing cellphone conversations for a large part of the ac­IllIn lind yet still creating huge tension.

The lilm is full of ironies - he is now using the com­p.nv'. own wellpon8 to wap,e war against it. Being fiction, the film 21"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"XVI ends with his victory. What's more, the key weapons - two bombs he has strategically placed - turn out not to have been armed at all. He simply relied on the company's fear of the true potential of its own weaponry. But that does not mean no-one gets killed, in fact he does shoot several people in cold blood, but they are all in some way implicated in the conspiracy he is unmasking, so don't really count as collateral damage. The only other death is his own. It's a terrific thriller, despite the limitations of dialogue over a phone and the sort of minor flaws where any thriller cuts corners to maintain excitement. And it represents a sort of ideal that the other two true stories merely aspire to. This man really did hit back at the system that enraged him, effectively drawing public attention and exposing corruption. The attack was much better fo cused than an attempt to end a whole era by killing one major figure representing it. And the hero goes out on a high note - un­like John Lennon's killer who may now be regretting how quickly his name was forgotten, while the legend of John Lennon lives on without being tarnished by us ever see him grow old and grey. LibertI! Stands Still is perhaps how it should be. Corrupt fat cats should know that every act that generates anger among the masses increases the likelihood of people returning that anger to them, with the possibility that among those angry people might be one or more with the skill, discipline and perseverence to aim well and hit them hard with the very rage they invoked. CHECKING THE SCORECARD A SOCIETY THAT ALLOWS people in power to get away with abusing that power at lesser citizens' expense, is not a just society. If the law does not stop this, then I celebrate those dedicated individu­als who can channel the outrage of the masses into an act that punishes the perpetrators. Again, it is not so much the act that I celebrate, as the knowledge it instils in the powerful that they can­not get away with it. Hooray for the terrorist that creates terror among the evil do­ers! It's a lovely thought, but comparing those films showed that there can be a huge gap between the ideal fiction revenge and what happens in real life. Noting that gap between true life and the ide­alised act of fiction, how would I rate the 9-11 attack? The first question must be, what was the attack directed against? It has been widely suggested that it was an attack on American 22"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"XXXII people or the American way of life. If that was so, 9-11 was a bit of a flop, because life for most Americans has gone on much as ever once the initial excitement wore off. Economic downturns have made a far greater impact than any terrorist threat. More realistically, 9-11 could be seen as an attack on American business, because business premises were struck. the stock markets did wobble a bit, and subsequent business travel has been ham­pered by all the added security at airports. But again, the effects were negligible compared to the damage perpetrated by financiers. Or was it an attack on the US government? In those terms 9-11 would be a total disaster, because it acted as a kiss of life for the Bush administration. Looking back at the gleeful reinstatement of torture and the subsequent denial of citizens' rights to privacy and justice, the image is not of a government under attack so much as that of a wild beast being released from captivity - a recent quote from a member of that administration was after 9-11, the gloves were off. Other governments, notably Blair's UK govern­ment, rushed to get in on the act by taking steps to stir up Muslim hostility in the hope that they too could enjoy the vicious freedoms t hat the public grants to government after such a large scale ter­rorist attack. To really appreciate the success of the 9-11 attacks, however, they need to be seen as attacks on Liberal Democracy - and that is why they were so welcomed by the more right wing governments. Bush and Bin Laden made gestures of hatred to each other, but both clearly insisted that they were working for the same boss -namely God. Liberal democracy, on the other hand, puts the will of the people above divine or government authority, it is a rational process that explores ways to constrain those authorities, and so it is hated by those who are revelling in the corruptions of power. lIot h Bush's advisors and Al Quaeda were united in their hatred of t he freedoms inherent in the American Way of Life and, by becom­ing the two horns of the one demon, created the split that started to tear those liberal traditions apart. Remember that the defeat of Adolph Hitler marked a rise in I he llcceptance of hi s policies - from the anti-communism of McCarthy in America to the racism of apartheid in South Africa, Hovertlments around the world were quick to promote motorways, pcople's cars, and the shaping of media for propaganda purposes. In 1110re recent times the defeat of Saddam Hussein hilS left us with 11 new role model for today's leaders who detest the tiresome rc\"t 1·l1ints imposed by Il Iiberlll democrIlcy -where even those 21"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"XVI supposedly in power are obliged to pay taxes, are forbidden to kill or torture their enemies or to seize citizen's assets, and have so little power to gag media criticism. Faced with these restraints, today's leaders look with longing on the freedoms enjoyed by third world dictators who can build glorious palaces and take their many wives and mistresses on endless shopping sprees while their citizens starve. Note that the poverty of others increases rather than diminishes their pleasure, for recent research has shown how happiness does not depend on absolute wealth so much as relative wealth. So the parasites gain greater satisfaction if their wealth is surrounded by poverty, even better if they get rich by making others poor. So we find an accelerating trend in many first world countries towards encouraging or even creating third world conditions across the nation. Britain, for example, has for three decades opted for policies that increase the gap between rich and poor, it has raised the stakes in violent crime by allowing police with guns to be seen in public places and to increasingly promote arrest with­out trial, and it is pushing ahead with an identity card scheme to criminalise the population. Meanwhile, in the US the income share of the richest ten percent has risen since 1978 from two times to three times private investment in GOP, and is now level with Chile and Brazil (Argentina and Mexico being closer to 2.5 times). As a former chief economist of the IMF, Johnson, puts it: In its depth and suddenness, the US economic and financial crisis is shockingly reminiscent of moments we have recent­ly seen in emerging markets, and onl!! in emerging markets. policies that were seen as signs of backwardness before 1980 have since been promoted as progress by politicians greedy for personal power. So I find myself comparing 9-11 with The Killing of John Lennon -a good effort, but I wish they'd chosen a different enemy. Just as I wish John Lennon's killer had waited a few decades and chosen to end this era rather than the 60S, so I wish Al Quaeda would pick on McDonalds, BAE, Exxon, Fox News, Halliburton or some other scum rather than direct its anger towards poor old Liberal Democracy. Knowing that Liberal Democracy was the target also helps to de­fine collateral damage. Do we see the business interests represent­ed by the World Trade Centre as part of the freedom permitted by liberal democracy? Or do we see them as enemies of the people? 24"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"XXXII It is debatable, but there is no doubt to me that the other passen­gers who died in those aircraft were collateral damage. Their death marks a failure in the enterprise, a fall from the Libertp Stands Still ideal. While I can admire the young men who hijacked those planes for their dedication and courage and resistance to a foul system that degrades our society, I regret the fact that the system still lives on while so many people of varying levels of involvement and innocence died as a result of their actions. In saying that, I recognise that I am drawing a distinction be­tween the freedom fighter and the terrorist. The freedom fighter aims at a precise enemy and does not want to alienate those it wishes to free by harming them along the way - for example the ANC's military wing tried hard to ensure that its bombs were placed to cause maximum inconvenience to the government, while risking as few lives as possible. Whereas the terrorist aims to destabilise the status quo and disrupt the environment that sup­ports its enemy and, if that means harming innocent parties, so be it. The terrorist is basically just shaking the die box and hoping that the next throw will be better. CHOOSING A WAY IN THOSE TERMS, I AM HERE ADVOCATING SUPPORT for the freedom li ghters, not the terrorists - while I also recognise that those under attack from freedom fighters will always label them as \"terrorists\". So, I would like a society where it was universally recognised that one characteristic that utterly disqualifies anybody from a po· sition of power is their lust for that power. A man driven primarily by a desire for power is the sort of man who would consider rape more exciting than consensual sex. This is the gang leader who wants to be feared more than loved, the ruler who actually delights in his people's hatred, for it makes him feel more powerful. Why is it that prestigious office buildings so often ruin the envi­ronment when you would have thought it better for the corporate imoge to make a beautiful. harmonious headquarters? It is because such people feel even more powerful when their gestures not only provide status but also degrade the status of those around them. Why did the government ignore the British people when they took to the streets against the proposed Iraq war? Blair did not ignore them, it was just that that the thrill of slaughtering moslems would"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"XVI be heightened, not diminished by knowing that the people were forced to do it against their will. The ultimate power thrill provided for such people is torture. Why was the US administration so eager to take off the gloves after 9-11? Because, as the school bully knows, there is no greater thrill for the power hungry than to make an intelligent individual hate them, then fear them, then finally be reduced at their will to a trembling mass of mindless terror - it makes them feel like \"real men\" for once. The thrill of being able to send those who voted for them away to be killed in war eventually wears thin in a de­mocracy that forbids its leaders from enjoying the ultimate thrill of torture. Sending victims on secret planes to countries that al­low torture provides some relief, but then why should foreigners get all the fun of playing \"real men\"? Thus we find waterboarding redefined as therapy rather than torture. The rot sets in and the rats snicker in glee. (Actually, I am being too specific here. The problem is not so much being driven by a lust for power, as being driven by a lust for any single un-complex objective.

If instead they had been award­ed bonuses on something like \"their contribution to the reputa­tion of the bank\" - a measure that would embrace profit, ethical behaviour, positive attitudes and image etc - it would do much greater good but would be a pain to administer. Legitimate busi­ness is sneered at by City financiers, who deem it \"cissy\" because it spreads wealth rather than concentrating it to maximise the thrill of relative privilege. That is why Britain has moved from a manu­facturing to a service economy since the 1970s.) What's more, I suspect that the privations imposed on Nelson Mandela in his 27 years in prison did a lot to shape him into the inspiring (but not perfect) leader he became. So that 27 years of brutal treatment should be a necessary prior condition for anyone who aspires to world leadership - anything less is too cheap a price. In this way all so-called \"top jobs\" would be filled only by people who had been elected into those positions by the masses in recognition of the many qualities they possess, and who would have only one desire: to fulfil public expectations and then get out as soon as possible. 26"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"XXXII It is inevitable that, even in such ideal conditions, decisions would still be made that evoked anger in parts of the population. Then I would wish for a tradition that encouraged people to consider whether their anger was the fault of certain people, or of a system within which they operated. For example: I can feel very angry at a board of directors voting to maintain their high salaries while re­ducing the workers' pay, but I can also recognise that it is possible as an individual to be quite high minded about making sacrifices and yet feel obliged to maintain a high income under pressure from a wife and family who expect to be supported in the way they have become accustomed to. In such a society I could indeed salute the presence of freedom fi ghters ready to take violent but very well targeted action against any abuses of power. But, alas, we do not live in such a society. Instead we are in a world where those who abuse power or pro­mote themselves through corruption increasingly get away with it and remain in power or, when admonished by the legal system, are able to finance an appeal, a media whitewash or a simple bribe and quickly return to their role. Outrage is seething in the populace, and has not yet found expression. What can we do? ACTION TilE BIRTH OF DEMOCRACY marked the development of an immune system to defend society against tyranny. But tyranny evolves fast and learned, like HIV, to infect the immune system itself. Thus, muck like Hitler, Thatcher, Bush and Blair can use the democratic process to slime their way into government and degrade their host. Society's immune system has a flaw that allows pollution to be ejected towards the head of the corporate body - as the saying goes \"scum rises to the top\". What is needed is to accelerate the evolution of society's immune system to cope with such malignant growths and spew out their excrement via more hygienic channels. The Internet provides a medium for synchronising mass feeling I1nd action. It also serves as an amplifier by means of resonance -you unload your feelings on an outrage website and others become Incensed and feed back further anger. So what is the Internet's po­lentinl for developing absolutely blistering waves of hatred ag ainst Iho�c who abuse power?

Hate! Hate!. .. \"? Tawdry media, inspired by Hitler's propaganda machine and its stirring of anger against Jews, have ever since used this feedback process to stir up public anger, but it would be a welcome change to see it arising spontaneously from the grass roots rather than being orchestrated in order to sell newspapers. How then to focus such a wave of feeling into an effective pur­gative? Here I call on the whole ancient tradition of cursing: the rituals, the chants, the fetishes, the pointing of bones etc. Of course, the sort of people we would rage against would laugh at the very idea of a magical attack having any effect. But such \"tough minded\" thugs do tend to have a superstitious underbelly, exemplified by those mafiosi who kill all week and then go to church on Sunday. Such people would publicly laugh off any curse, and yet they only need suffer a few small setbacks or bits of bad luck to set in train a sense of unease that could make them wonder whether there might be something in it after all. That is human nature, and it begins the slide into terror ... Moving beyond the traditional curse, I look for what the market­ing folk would call a \"campaign able\" attack concept -that is to say an attack that \"has legs\" and can evolve with time. This is perhaps best illustrated with an example. Around 1980, when Margaret Thatcher was at her most noxious, a friend suggested manufactur­ing and marketing voodoo Thatcher dolls to be hung in the rear windows of cars - provided along with a set of interesting-looking needles to be used for piercing the doll (at the time there was a minor craze for hanging fetishes in car windows). I saw it as a great concept because it was self-promoting: each car becomes a shop window where carrying such a doll would allow it to be seen by dozens of amused passers-by, who would tell other people and build a demand for such dolls, and thus launch a popular craze. Interestingly, I read recently that the idea re-emerged in the shape of voodoo dolls of a French politician, though I'm not sure whether these too were designed for hanging in cars. Now the nature of such crazes is that they flare up until they become a cliche then they quickly die away - for who bothers to buy such a doll once it's lost all novelty value? So my suggestion was that the dolls should all have a tiny magical sigil concealed somewhere on them. Then, as the craze began to abate, they get someone with acting ability to approach the media in a state of panic, saying that they had been working for the company making"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"XXXII these dolls and that they fled in terror when they discovered that, far from being just a comic novelty, these dolls were part of a se­rious magical attack designed to undermine the authority of our beloved Prime Minister. When questioned by the media, the stooge should do all the usual things like insisting on not being named, not giving an address and only been seen in silhouette on televi­sion interviews, because they were \"scared stiff of the power of these evil people\". After a flurry of publicity the doll manufacturers would fight back with solicitors' letters and very expensive lawyers demand­ing proof of these \"scurrilous and utterly unfounded accusations\". Then the bombshell would be released: \"remove the doll's right leg and you will see a tiny occult symbol of evil printed on every doJl\". This disclosure generates a new wave of publicity and more people buying the dolls to see if they really did have magic symbols on them. To keep up the momentum you then employ some nauseatingly greasy and sinister-looking company spokespersons to publicly deny the claims and make nasty innuendos in the face of an in­creasing number of employees paid to flee from the company and demand police protection from the satanic cult that they claim to be behind the operation. When the story has been spun out as long as possible, and the public finally tires of the whole business, that is when you give the dying horse a final flogging by announc­ing that the whole thing was from inception just a cynical set-up designed to maximise profit - knowing there will always be some who continue to insist that this final story is just the latest cleve r cover-up for what really was an evil satanic plot. What I am suggesting by this example is that magical attacks on nasty public figures need to be designed in such a way that they can run and run rather than make just one big impact that could miss the mark. The rationalist tradition is still strong in our soci­ety, so any such person would initially laugh off a magical attack and be presented by their spin doctors as \"sensible\" and \"havinp, a sense of humour\" as a result. But when an attack continues (lnd keeps flaring up in public awareness, there will almost inevitnbly be chance setbacks in the victim's career, and these can be ascribed to the power of the attack and thus generate an uneasy feeling of lTl·dibility."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"XVI CONCLUSION WE ARE FACING A CURIOUS ANOMALY in our civilisation at present. The public is growing increasingly ethical at the same time as those in power grow increasingly greedy and corrupt. Plato would not like this, nor would those Enlightenment thinkers who believed that the masses need noble leaders to steer their upward evolution towards an ideal society. Greedy and corrupt people have nothing to gain, and everything to lose, from the civilising effects of a liberal democracy, and so they have been taking measures to turn back Western societies towards the political state of the world's worst governed third world countries. They yearn for the unfettered power enjoyed by a wealthy minority under a banana dictatorship. This generates outrage in those without the power to stop them. There is little that an individual can do to fight back. It is danger­ous to hold such rage, as it can be manipulated by those in power to serve their own ends - as when a freedom fighter is identified as a \"terrorist\" and is used as an excuse to impose even greater controls on the masses. So we need to find some way of directing such outrage back to those whose actions are responsible for generating it. Unless we really are in a position to deliver a tightly targetted and effective attack as in Libertr Stands Still, the best option could be to unite and form an enhanced immune system to resist such corruption. The disteleocracy might seem invulnerable behind their body­guards, surveillance cameras and electric fences, but they do have one potential weakness: in declaring war on Enlightenment val­ues they are unwittingly undermining humanity's finest defence against superstition. As they direct society into primitivism and chaos, they empower the fear of the unknown. Harness that fear, that nascent uncertainty, by launching global curses against them, and see how long they can hold out. Next time you burn with out­rage and feel like scratching the paintwork of a black Mercedes with diplomatic number plates. just make sure you scratch a curse thereon. Then direct your rage to flow into that curse with such ferocity that it leaves a vacuum in your soul - a vacuum that can draw into itself the Love of Humanity.

Artworks of different kinds become cells and building blocks of a new pagan pantheon of intelligence, of whose essence future generations can rely on and partake of. Special importance should be given to indigenous, traditional. tribal folk culture, woven into the mosaic fabric of genuine human creation. The final times of our mercurial technocratic culture could actually help in setting this up before these new gods are properly established enough to live on through the rituals of the post-technocracy-survivors. In ancient grimoires, forces were evoked to visible appearance in order to be questioned and/or commanded through certain ar­cane techniques and mind-frames. This was also true of art up until High Priest Duchamp celebrated the mental and concep­tual while discarding two-dimensional bourgeois thought and a wordly Weltanschauung. When art suddenly became intellectual. i ntangible and non-personal. the power of the old forces by no means decreased. They just went into a slight hibernation, await­ing the duchampian antithetical fulfillment. The coming synthesis of tangible, will-driven talismanic art and an anti-bourgeois, non­commodified approach will be a distinct characteristic of our new pantheon's magical bag of tricks. Is it a far-fetched idea or one worthy of consideration? I think it should be considered as a project where individual seeds are sown in communal ground, where each garden patch then in itself becomes a new seed, and so on. I believe it is possible to make a quantum quilt of new creative possibilities. I wouldn't be surprised at all if the sacrament of the new reli­gion will be psychedelic - either organic or chemical. The tran­substantiation process in itself and the integration of the divine in edible, digestible form has been with us since the dawn of hu­man time. The psychedelic age, with its chaotic beginnings in the mid 1960s, has been instrumental in bringing forth a radical re­evaluation of art, aesthetics, thought, philosophy, etc. I can foresee this pleasant open-min dedness becoming a prerequisite for future communications with the very principles of life, of nature, of hu­man interaction as well as those of art and culture. We discover things when they're apparently badly needed. We seem to have a built-in intuition in situations of dire emergency. An expansion of the mind and a related expansion of art are crucial emergency routes at this point in time and space. 12"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"EVERYTHING MUST GO -ON! What's wrong with the old grids and frames of reference then? Well, I don't think anyone really doubts the sincerity of some re­ligious believers or entertainment industry people, but the focus on greed in both areas help facilitate what I call the \"180° phe­nomenon.\" What's put on for show actually, in reality, signifies the opposite. An example: although the \"moral\" key in disaster movies -that we should all work together as one human race post the big disaster - seems fair, fine and human(istic), the effect of the mov­ies actually engender subconscious fear of disasters that will very likely never happen. What on the surface appears to be benevolent cathartic entertainment in fact cements the biggest lie of all: that humans are victims of nature, separate from general biospheres and eco-systems. Well, in a sense we are the victims now, but it's certainly no fault of nature's! What does this huge fear create in human beings? As with all fears, a desire to be safe. How do people handle this today? They consume. Here's another example: If it's so painfully obvious that m::my people are starving today, why then not, as a first step at least, celebrate, encourage or even enforce the use of contraceptives among the cultures and people who can't, at this point in time, deal with their own fertility? The gilded pro-life (so called) be­nevolence of the Catholic Church and State makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. They simply engender fear through fiction so that people remain loyal to the herd. And pay their dues. The same old story over and over again.

However, everything must go, disintegrate, fall down, evapo­rate ... As all empires crumble, so will the hegemonial grip of fragmenting entertainment and the parasitic power of the mon­otheistic power structures. After this huge \"paradigm shift\" hus taken place, I foresee a development towards a post-technocratic neo-feudal (;Ulture, where food access will be the driving force. A variety of land owners will protect what they have through pri­vately owned armies and regional skirmishes will be common. The technological \"daze\" will have created a new breed of mindless serfs who will be forced into manual labour.

The art has to be relevant to the times, as always. One gets the culture one deserves. If artists conscious of this already now start working in their own pantheonic cellular bio-art-work, the transition may be gentler and more intelligent, with less violence and devastation. Showing the past in its often violent manifesta­tions through art can help change how we approach the future. Non-dogmatic instructions are just some of the building blocks I'm referring to. The escapist aspects of wishful thinking are easier to distill in hard times. That's why art in our present times is thin, evanes­cent, transparent, dreamy, infantilistic, afraid. The current core of thought on a deeply rooted emotional level is spelled S-U-R-V-I­V-A-L. If our own culture is afraid to deal with it because of com­placency or ingrained fear best cured with entertainment, then pioneers and movers and shakers will have to take responsibility and show new models and possible avenues. It really is time for our culture to grow up. By \"growing up\" or \"taking responsibility\", I'm not specifically referring to technological solutions of \"saving\" energy, the envi­ronment, nature etc - humans in panic seemingly always need to \"save\" something ! -but rather of multidimensional artists evok­ing new behavioural patterns, intelligence interchanges, existen­tial models. These experimental engineers will very likely not use the commonplace given methods (art history, empirical science, interest-based economy, etc) but rather seek out entirely new ways based on visionary perspectives and, not forgetting, common sense. When we meta-program the future through our art, we are very aware that our will is not singular and its manifestations may not be exactly as \"wished\" (analogous dynamics may occur in tradi­tionaL magic). If we do good according to our own plans, yet the world is breaking apart in cataclysmic upheavals of politics and geo-shudders, we shouldn't be discouraged.

What could be a free-flowing exchange of irrational (in the good sense, I have to emphasize), emotional and radical ideas, has become hi-jacked/lo-jacked and dragged into an arena of stress, trade, illusion and mere decoration. I'm not merely talk­ing about fine art in the traditional sense, but about our entire culture. Everything's commodified and marketed except perhaps events (performances, temporary installations, etc) which are usu­ally handled by a sub/supra-economy of institutional funding. The direct communication between artwork and viewer is perhaps best handled by classic structures like museums and publicly avail­able collections. The shady relationship between these kinds of structures and the art dealers is more than well-known though. Kickbacks mean the possibility to kick back and who could ask for more in stressful times like these? Grassroots reactions in the form of art are seldom vital in them­selves in the long run, but definitely interesting as phenomenae where art in itself is actually looked upon as more powerful than throwing a rock at a building. The expression of aggression and frustration by proxy is an emotional-magical act that could be in­tegrated in mainstream culture if it's loud enough (punk culture being one clear example). That's how the overall culture works, by sucking up new, radical and aggressive seeds into its own slow­grinding soil. Whether the seed later becomes a bland garden flower or a nutritious vegetable no one powerful curator or insti­tution can singularly decide. Herein lies not only great stimulating mysteries but also great optimism for the future. And here we come again to the crux, so to speak: history shows, again and again, that change in direction, culture and behaviour comes not through divine providence but through distinctly human initiative. people with ideas and the will to manifest the ideas in question take on the role of creators and leaders and then change everything. How does this revolutionary process begin?

Our culture is saturated with concepts like freedom and choice but advertising, expertly using feelings of insecurity, make most people strive for complacent and comfortable homogenity. It's literally the emper­or's new clothes designed by black magic: everyone wants a piece of the exclusive but everyone looks exactly the same! Is it far-fetched to call our present culture one of illusion? We are presented with givens but none can really tangibly be taken, unless you very clearly leave the trodden paths. \"Who dares wins\" is something we are taught, but the culture as such does not en­courage its manifestation in action. At this point, we can touch upon the concept of magic in itself. As with most terms, it is used as the tribal leaders see fit. Today, it is undoubtedly synonymous with stage magic, tricks, illusions, extravagant, flamboyant magicians and their scantily dressed as­sistants. The magical aspects of pre-science and pre-culture, the pioneering seed-sowing work, are humourously disposed of. The aspects of empowerment of the individual. tribe, society, etc, ditto. The aspects of consciousness training also.

Why is this? The fear of real. tangible change in one's life is greater than the fear of abstracted demons and wizards in our entertainment-drenched contempo­rary mythology. Is my view of the future too dystopic? Isn't it better to try and get along in peace and harmony instead of painting things black? Well, of course it is, but not to the point of cheating ourselves that human happiness comes from dictated consumer patterns. Or that genuine happiness comes from obeying those one intuitively feels are ripping you off (or even apart). My view is not dystopic. It is realistic.

The XVl'h trump, known as The Tower, The House of God, The Lord of the Hosts of the Mighty, became incarnate in 21st century televised broadcasts. A plane pirouetting and swooning into glass, metal and flames lin­gers in our imaginations as the quintessence of terror. The resem­blance to depictions of the Tower is uncanny. In this essay, I wish to examine how the Tower is reflected in two historical events: the World Trade Center attack of September 11th and the downfall of an African Divine King in 15th century Oyo, Nigeria. First, a little background on the card itself. The Tower did not always appear in early decks. According to Tom Tadford Little, whose website Tarot Hermitage is an impressive account of Tarot history, The Tower's place in a deck was often occupied by Fire or the Gates of Hell. He hypothesizes that the Tower itself was a symbol of European nobility. A lightning struck tower carried too grave a political implication for the aristocracy who commis­sioned many early cards. Little examines the connection between the Tower and its preceding trump, the Devil: The connection with the Devil (and Tower) is ... understood in terms of his lordship over the world of matter; he blocks the way of the spirit that seeks the heavenly world . ... The Devil ... shaped the world of matter to be a prison for the human spirits. He erected for himself and his minions a great dwell­ing extending above the Earth, a kind of false heaven. But when Sophia, divine Wisdom, reveals herself to the enslaved spirits, the Devil's tower shakes and falls. Through the Tower, the vanity and devilish bonds of the Devil are destroyed. That interpretation is evident in some of the tower card's earliest iterations. For instance, Trump XX, Nenbroto, of the Sola Busca deck, dated to the late 15th century, depicts a young man overwhelmed by a pillar disintegrating amidst a hail of divine fire. On top of the column is a globe symbolic of man's mastery of the world. Already lying on the ground are a helmet and crown. The lightning bolt pierces the actor's heart through his breastplate and shielding hand. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is that man's designs are puny when challenged by divine righteousness. False pride and artifice are laid waste. The image warns against living through vain constructions. It is also a forerunner of depictions 41"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"XV! of the Tower. Many of those depictions level human hierarchy for both king and peasant who tumble out of windows when God vents his wrath. To me, the Tower card symbolizes the moment when we per­ceive the world apart from God. We imagine the loneliness and terror of a world without a divine spirit existing in it. Such a world is ruin. The building falls because reason fails. There is no underly­ing purpose for existence. According to Papus in Tarot of tbe Bobemians, the Tower mani­fests in three worlds - in God's as Divine Destruction, in Man's as the Fall, and in the Universe's as the Visible World. The worlds represent extremes of spirituality and materialism. In the case of the Tower, its presence in the purely spiritual World of God elicits the direct action of God through his anger. God withdraws his presence as the Tower manifests in the two lower worlds. He can no longer be perceived in the World of the Universe (matter.) Divine wrath and punishment lead to a barren extreme, the world with only its edifices. Without Divine energy, earthly constructions are useless and hollow. Many people felt that God abandoned them on September 11th. Household heads did not return home. More than one bereaved family member protested during televised interviews that they could not imagine a world in which their loved one would not return home. Such an event could not occur in a universe with a merciful god at its center. The list of victims seemed endless, with no distinction made for anyone's place in society. Both the execu­tive and charwoman perished. As an ex-New Yo rker who had worked at the Trade Center many years ago, its destruction seemed unreal. In later years I recog­nized the Trade Center as a skyline fixture that indicated I was approaching home in my travel up the New Jersey Turnpike. For solace, I tried reading tarot cards on the phone line that day. It was during those exchanges that I began to realize the depth of the tragedy. My callers that day exhibited the usually self-absorbed spiritual poverty that percolates through the 900 psychic lines. I could not understand how little they seemed to care about what was going on. I tried to block out their callousness and focus on my cards. I had faith that I would find integrity and truth among their numerous signs. However, I could not connect with my dog­eared Thoth deck. Increasingly, spreads I threw did not make scnsc. Eventually, a sweet grandmother called.

Panic had replaced the spirits who were normally there for me. I felt like someone had just punched a giant hole into heaven. Since then, I. along with other readers who've shared their ex­periences with me, have come to recognize that the Tower can represent September 11th for clients, rather than reference a spe­cific tragedy in their lives. This new attribution gives testament to the tarot's ability to adapt itself to new circumstances. Of course, this is not the first time a period in history has been defined by a disaster akin to a lightning struck tower: think of the poison ashes of Hiroshima, the downfall of the French monarchy, the burning of Rome. These are just a few examples of events that illustrate the Tower principle. THE TOWER UNDERSCORES A SIMILAR TRAGEDY that took place in Oyo, Nigeria in the 15005. Oyo is the setting for the Oba ko so myth. Oba ko so literally means tbe King does not bang. The affir­mation applies to the orisha Shango as a mortal king who brought down lightning on his own castle. (Orisha are demi-gods in Yo ruba religion. Belief in them has endured in the New World through Santeria and Candomble.) It is a story of witchcraft , devastation, suicide, apotheosis and a 'virgin' birth in hell. As a deity, Shango embodies virility, passion and divine justice. Historically, he was the fourth Alafin of Oyo. His brilliant ascend­ancy to the throne and leadership ability brought him worship during his lifetime. However, his fiery disposition led to his down­fall. Samuel Johnson writes of him in Tbe Historr of tbe Yo rubas: He was of a very wild disposition, fiery temper, and skilful in sleight of hand tricks. He had a habit of emitting fire and smoke out of his mouth, by which he greatly increased the dread his subjects had of him. Shango ruled for many years, greatly increasing the size of his realm through his constant answer to the call of battle. It is said that his had three principal wives: Oba (his legitimate wife). Oshun and his favorite Oya. Shango also plied his wiles as a sorcerer, making charms. Today his faithful attest that there is no greater witch than Shango. Once he designed a charm to attract lightning. Johnson describes what happened next: 41"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"XVI The palace at Oyo was built at the foot of a hill called Oke Ajaka (Ajaka's hill). One day the king ascended this hill ac­companied by his courtiers and some of his slaves, among whom were his two favorites, Biri and Omiran; some of his cousins went with him but none of his children. He was minded to try the preparation he had in hand; thinking it might have been damp and useless, he first made the ex­periment on his own house. But it took effect, a storm was immediately raised and the lightning had struck the palace before they came down the hill, and the buildings were on fire. Many of Shango's wives and his children perished in this catastrophe. Shango was ashamed. It is rumored that a powerful force in state asked him to resign (and thus have to commit suicide). Whether or not that occurred, Shango had 160 of his subjects slain when he lost his temper because they showed too much concern over him and his situation. Even his use of sorcery was turned against him. His subjects felt that he exerted too much power. Already king, master of all, he could affect events and people supernaturally. That was too much power for a monarch. Shango began his exodus. His favorite slaves, Biri and Omiran, and Oya joined him. Shango refused advice from both slaves that he return to Oyo and accept the tributes which promised to rebuild his palace and restock his wives. Disgusted both men turned back. Oya visited her family at Ira. Abandoned, Shango hanged himself from a Shea butter tree. When word of Shango's death reached Oyo, his followers were shamed into action. They took the lightning attractant powder Shango had created and placed it in the homes of his enemies. Soon all who opposed him met horrible deaths in lightning strike fires. His fo llowers proclaimed, Oba Ko so, the King does not hang. It appeared that Shango had dispensed justice from beyond the grave. What happened to Shan go during his time in Ile Iku, the house of the dead? There he met Yewa, the beautiful daughter of Olofi, God on Earth, dedicated to remain a virgin. Legend said that they m t once before years earlier. Shango entered the secret garden where she was kept. She looked upon him and experienced lust.

She renders the waste of inert flesh into nutrients for the earth. When he visited the lower depths, Shango seduced the eter­nal virgin. Their son, Brusina, is conferred on initiates when they receive the mysteries of Yewa. She is nonetheless regarded by the faithful as being an intact virgin. Shango found his way out of the land of the dead by inseminating Yewa - the ultimate eater of men -with the seed of life. His virility manifested in the outermost realm of desolation and loss, and he triumphed. The secret son became a means of the Father's immortality. Raised from the dead, Shango became orisha. I recognize the archetypes embodied by orisha in the Tarot. Whilst many other diverse deities and myths are illustrated by the picture card book of life, what is inspiring about Oba ko so's re­lationship to the Tower is Shango's redemption from the land of the dead. Shango's tragedy is transformative. He emerges from it as a divinity. When the flawed king dies, it is the memory of his leadership and savvy that endure in legend among his people. Even the bloody lightning bolts and tower itself of the 16th trump are among his own holy emblems! When the Tower appears in a tarot card reading, the reader may wish to recall Shango's energy, his enormous appetite for life and ability to think on his feet in order to guide the client through turmoil. In response to the burning towers of September 11th, many in the Santeria community turned to Shango for solace. The Lukumi Gathering discussion board, a popular Santeria discussion group, overflowed with announcements of drum parties for Shango and propitiatory prayers for him. Shango embodies the dance of life and celebrates it throughout every nerve pathway in his divine essence. He is dressed in flames. Another story about his divine nature states that he was hurled to earth as a baby by a lightning bolt - one more echo of a lightning struck tower. Shango is the wrath of God. The destruction wrought in the Tower results from specific behavior. Retribution can befall a human actor, a King or even an entire nation.

Part of being able"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE TOWER to pick ourselves up involves recognition of what we have done to lead ourselves to this point in time. Recent actions in the Middle East, as well 'old history', demand examination. The Tower dispels comfort. It forces us to examine what we have done so that we can rebuild effectively. I believe that the bricks and mortar that held the tower together were coming apart long before lightning struck. Freedom lurks amongst the rubble. We no longer have to waste our precious time and energy trying to hold together an ineffectual construct. Strength is imparted on those who pass through the conflagration. Tests by fire are part of Shango's nature. That which has been struck by lightning is sacred to him. In Yo rubaland, his priests immediately took possession of houses struck by lightning. They plundered the wreckage for a precious commodity: edun am, the stones created by the fusion of electricity and soil during the light­ning strike. (Interestingly, they also gained the property to add to their real estate, and were suspected by many of the dispossessed to direct the lightning attacks to increase their wealth). Edun ara are rare and valuable. They possess sacred force. They are foci for lightning's power, and they endure. In spite of the evil events that led to Shango's death, he still possessed a spark of divinity to ignite his immortal legend. The Tower's fire liberates both positive and negative energies from their material form. It is a long established scientific truth that energy never dissipates. Energies unleashed by tragic events such as the Trade Center attack do not simply cease to exist. They con­tinue to be available to us so that we can harness, redirect and even transform them along new pathways. When the Tower breaks apart, we can look at it as symbolic of our situation. It terrifies us. At the same time, it beckons us to recognize its destruction as a turning point in our lives. Even in the coldest depths of hell, Shango was able to rally the vibrant life force that led him to his over-indulgence and disaster. This time, he used it to create new life and transcend his circumstances. When we perceive the Tower card's meaning manifest in our lives, Shango's feat contains the seed of truth that can enable us to survive. It takes an enormous amount of energy to effect an edifice's destruction. That power is still present. We need to find the courage within us to use that force to effect change. 47"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"XVI TONICHT MARKS THE EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9-11. A holograph­ic image of the two towers looms over the Manhattan landscape and is seen on television screens nation-wide. Much television programming once more recounts the events of that day and the political events that followed. Images from that day playa role in the Western diviner's approach to the Tower. Images of the World Trade towers have been indelibly printed on the public imagina­t ion, and their resemblance to Tower depictions are too strong to overlook. However, to analyze how Western culture - particularly the US and the United Kingdom - have responded socially does not do much for me in developing my understanding of the Tower right now. Much has changed for me in eight years. I was widowed after eighteen years. The padrino who initiated me into the mysteries of Santeria, also died. I accrued a small fortune only to see it van­ish over the course of four months as I paid bills due to a per­sonal medical catastrophe. Events such as these have taught me how quickly any structure I embrace has the potential to dissipate suddenly and force me to reinvent my world. Such experiences provoke a more visceral personal reaction to the Tower when it appears in the context of divination. The way I perceive phenomena has also shifted. On a mundane level, my mode of creative self-expression is visual art more so than writing now. I try less to eke out precise word meanings be­hind symbols. I respond to elements that immediately catch my eye, and more often free associate. Interestingly I have illustrated the Tower at least three times in the past eight years. Each time the images have provoked comments to the effect: Oh my God, you're a pervert. That's a penis, not a tower. Is that all you think about? Initially that conscious notion did not playa role in how I ex­ecuted the drawings and paintings. I try not to impose meaning in my art but to stay true to what needs to develop on the page and arrange a harmony of elements that arrive at a balance. However, such responses to my own work motivated me in conducting re­search for this essay to look at many Tower images anew and determine if what others saw in my work was reflected historic representations of the Tower. More importantly, what could that suggest about its organic meaning? How can we use that in a new way?"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE TOWER It is naIve to suppose that familiar representations of the Tower are not blatantly phallic. One only needs to look at them. The earli­est extant illustration of the Tower in a tarot appears in the Charles VI tarot, housed at the Bibliotheque Nationale de France in paris, and attributed to an anonymous artist from Ferrara, c. 1470. The image usually named the Tower suggests an ejaculating phallus. Its depiction establishes visual motifs that became common to that of a lightning struck tower found in most Marseilles and the rectified Oswald Wirth style decks. In it falling bricks hold the place later assumed by floating globules, scattered Hebrew glyphs and actors ejected as ejaculate matter from the tower in later decks. Another early example has a homoerotic bent. The aforementioned trump XX, Nenbroto, of the Sola Busca deck, evokes a penis as the light­ning shaft plunging directly into the subject with a suggestion of sodomy given the strong visual emphasis on the comely victim's buttocks in the illustration. (The Sola Busca deck also has a mi­nor arcana depicting a subject with grossly exaggerated testicles which may have been a symptom of plague or sexually commu­nicated disease. The artist was not prudish). Further, it is not a great stretch to indicate that Pamela Coleman-Smith's depiction in the popular Rider-Waite deck suggests circumcision or an even crueler cut. Of course, it is easy to suggest that any cylindrical shape, such as a tower, indicates a penis. However, if you examine fundamental literature about the Tower (I will cite Wirth and Aleister Crowley) and compare that to spiritual beliefs and practices that relate to phallic symbolism I believe this simple observation will reveal yet another dimension of the Tower. Wirth's description in The Tarot of the Magicians is striking in its emphasis on the condensation of matter in trump XVI and its correlation to Hindu beliefs about the Shiva lingham. Wirth's language is replete with veiled sexual references: one important faculty to develop when reading esoteric texts is to be open to interpreting subtext. First, Wirth's description of the Tower itself reminds one of a phallus: [The tower is composed of) bricks ... of an overall flesh colour to indicate that it is a question of living construction en­dowed with sensitivity. 49"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"XVI I'd like to juxtapose one of Wirth's simpler statements with a Hindu story. Wirth writes: Arcana 16 presents with the picture of a similar tower in the Lightning-struck Tower, a typical designation, for it is less a temple, a house of God, than a sacred building of a body mistakenly identified with God. The identification is the consequence of original sin which clouds the spirit descended into matter. The Fall is the natural conse­quence of incarnation, which is not necessarily the result of a pri­mordial fault. The sin of Adam is relative and only exists in rela­tion to blind humanity which whines on seeing itself condemned to work without understanding that they make themselves divine by associating themselves willingly with the eternal work of creation. Hindu mythology describes how Shiva became represented by the lingham or phallus. Once, a great sage went to consult Shiva. When he arrived, Shiva was busy making love to his wife, Parvati, and did not receive the holy man until they were finished. The Holy man was outraged and cursed Shiva to be eternally worshipped as a lingham because of his carnal appetite. While the symbolic attribution of the penis to Shiva is not exactly equivalent, I believe much can be drawn from how his totality is represented by an organ. Wirth calls attention to how a \"sacred building of a body is mistakenly identified with God.\" Also, the long-held correspond­ence between the Fall and sexuality and Shiva's enthusiasm strikes a similar vibration. Wirth's introduction of the Tower and profounder Hindu beliefs about lingham also reflect on each other. The Tower in arcana XVI is the first building that we meet in the Tarot, where similar constructions are only shown in the Moon. Now XVI, XVII and XVIII make up the sixth ternary, which cor­responds to the body of earthly Adam, that is to say the organism which is constructed out of human individuality, or to the organ­ism of humanity seen as a whole. We have in XVI the first term of the ternary spirit and in XVIII the last term of the same triad, the result of corporization when it is carried out. Nothing is corpor­ized without the presence of condensation, first ethereal or fluid, under the restrictive or particularizing influence that is agreed we attribute to the Devil. So the Devil becomes the spiritual father of the smallest atom, no less than of the immeasurable cosmic sys­tem, for at the root of both one and the other there is conceived 50"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE TOWER a wild whirlwind around a centre of attraction which is perforce selfish and grabbing. Here I quote from an online article by Nitin Kumar, The Shiva Linga: Images of Cosmic Manhood in Art and Mpthologp, that para­phrases many popular references on lingham worship. It also touches on a few more myths that the reader is encouraged to investigate at his own leisure. According to Stella Kramrisch, the linp,a of Shiva has three levels of signification; these are: 1 As a sign of Shiva: this is evident in the literary meaning of the word linga, and also in the fact that the linga fell from Shiva's own body. Indeed, God resides in whatever is part of god. 2 The Linga as Phallus: this is depicted in the tale of the curse of sage Bhrigu, and Shiva's violation of the chaste wives of the ascetics in the forest. \\ The Linga as made up of cosmic substance: established in the tale of the rivalry of Brahma and Vishnu. In a different three-fold division, it is believed that the )jnga l'Ilntains within itself all three divinities of the Indian trinity of Supreme Godhead, namely Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Brahma IIhitles in the lower part that is hidden inside the earth. Vishnu occupies the middle portion of the linga that is covered by the pl'tlestul, and finally there is Shiva, in the top portion that is visible IIhove the pedestal. The trinity contained in the lingham and the ternary con fig­uf'lItion that Wirth begins with the Tower further link the two. I :mwley more explicitly establishes this correspondence. He em­plOYN Shivu us an actor in the Tower, or War, in the tarot deck hI' conceived with Frieda Harris. In Hinduism, Shiva personifies hoth procreative and destructive energies.

Crowley describes them: Falling from the tower are broken figures of the garrison. It will be noticed that they have lost their human shape. They have become mere geometrical expressions. Compare this with Wirth's descrip­tion of spheres in his tarot: It remains to mention the multicoloured spheres which the explosion of the Tower seems to have projected into the en­vironment. They are the energies accumulated by life, con­densations which red indicates as being sulphurous or fiery, green as being passively vitalized in the mercurial order, and yellow as being dead like straw or even empty seashells. It is important to note that in both tantric Hindu meditation and some traditions of Western sex magick that ejaculation is not the object of the meditative or magickal act. Release would represent a failure. A Yogi manifests the godhead of infinite potential creation by achieving a sustained erection. That would be devastated by ejaculation. Similarly, many Western practices, including homo­sexual sex magick that Crowley references in his description of the atu, focus on the harnessing of masculine sexual energy without its actual release. It might prove useful to look at these practices in light of the Nenbroto image. The tragedy of the Tower takes place through a release of male energy in undifferentiated forms. Crowley exposes this somewhat cryptically by talking about the magical work simultaneously with the Tower's esoteric meaning embodying the will to live and the Will to die. When a man ejaculates, whether in or with a partner of either gender or by himself, his semen is not a differentiated life form in itself. His energy gushes. His penis looses its rigidity and structural integrity. Even if insemination occurs, a newborn child is, as Wirth points out: ... but pure animal. He by nothing but himself with the most absolute and unconscious egoism. He carries the potential to become a destructive fo rce.

A lighting bolt in the shape of the number 7 appeared in the heavens striking the tower and breaking Shango free from his shackles. He easily sub­dued his captors. In that act, Oya gave Shango the use of lighting, which was her gift and weapon. This story occurs in the divination verses for the holy odu Obara­Sa. Right now, for me, it is the story that first comes to mind when I think of the Tower. There are a number of reasons for this. I draw on my Western upbringing and look at the prominence of the number seven being the combined reduction of 16. I employ re­duction in some Tarot reading techniques. There is a methodology of reading numbers in Santeria in which the number seven is in­terpreted as Eje which means to destroy or consume. That relates the Tower's typical meaning and is yet another synchronicity that weaves through the image fabric in systems of meaning by which I understand how disparate spiritual principles connect. The narrative employs the visual elements common to tarot im­ages, and I perceive this as a very erotic story. An exact translation of Oya's song is beyond my capability since it is rife with double entendres, many of which also have specific spiritual connotations. Basically, she says that I hope my lightning reaches you effectively because I'm mentally sending it to you pronto making your stick or penis standup. Centella which means lightning bolt also refers to Oya's name Centella ndoki - literally lightning bolt in a dark state - in the Bakongo necromantic religion Palo - which literally means stick - that many Santeros also practice. When the story was first told to me, the storyteller made a point to sing it like a love song and touched his crotch. Metaphorically, Shango is con­fined by his own hapless desire and is only freed when his beloved releases her energy whilst contemplating a phallic representation of him in astral projection. Oya manipulates Shango's phallic en­ergy in a state of deep meditation to realize her own vision and delivery of force. Hers is a transcendent act.

I did have a grandmother who was into gardening, but she tended towards pansies and pachysandra. My fa mily were middle-class American suburbanites who saw eve­rything in terms of the latest scientific theories, and would have found my practice of talking to plants fanciful at best and ridicu­lous at worst.

It was the European herbs that drew me in with those memories, and specifically ones from northern latitudes, or that had been naturalized there. 1 also felt that from some of the local North American plants in the ecosystems where 1 lived, but those seemed to be less about \"1 remember you - don't you remem­ber me?\" and more about \"Hey, 1 saw you when you were a kid, talking to that plantain.

I found that when the Grandparent spirit was standing over them, the little plant spirit didn't mind giving up its leaves, and even the sacrifice of its entire being was not accompanied by negative feelings. The Grandparent spirit simply gathered it in, and I took its body to make medicine with. For medicine they were. I was poor, and had no health insur­ance, and was chronically ill. Taking herbs saved me from wasting my meager money on doctors often enough to make it definitely worth my while. It was quite satisfying, too -I was getting one over on the Man.

The stories also tended to refer to the shamans as only having one or two allies; instead, I was expected to make some kind of alliance, however tentative, with every sort of plant that would talk to me. Two plants in particular dogged my footsteps, and I began to refer to them as my watch-wights. Before I had learned that term, I just made sure to look for one or the other of both whenever I found a new apartment, even in the city. If I saw one or the other, it was a sign that this place would be important or useful to me. One was Belladonna, the other Elder. They were the first Grandmother spirits that I ever faced. Lady Belladonna was dark and sleek, languid and sardonic, sorceress and Black Qu een, sharp and dangerous as a stiletto, the Mata Hari of the plant world. Even though she told me that she had been set to guard me by my patron goddess Hela, I have always been careful to treat her with respect and never turn my back on her. Dame Ellhorn, on the other hand, was a dignified grandmother, a wisewoman of noble blood who expected me to treat her with courtly manners. At first I thought that she had been set to guard me as well, but she told me that she had merely seen me once as a child and had taken a liking to me, which suggests that all my talking to weeds paid off. One was Gerda, wife of Frey the god of agriculture, the Sacred Corn King. My wife is descended from Frey's festival-got children - her mother's maiden name was Ingerson - and we both called on his blessing when we began our small farm and the first vegetable beds went in, the first goats and sheep and chickens found their pens. It would be later that I met his wife. Gerda is a giantess­goddess, quiet and dark and heavy where Frey is golden and bright and laughing. Her name means guard, and she came to me as the Lady of the Walled Garden. Frey oversaw our farm, but the herbs were Gerda's place. Indeed, as the garden grew, she claimed more and more of it until the whole area within the stone walls and fences became her sacred place. She would come to me while I was weeding or digging - conveniently already on my knees before her - and talk to me about the herbs, telling me their stories. They weren't stories I'd ever read, and I don't know if they have ever been written down. The shamanic tradition of my ancestors was lost while they still had an oral culture.

To this day, when I meet other herbalists, they invariably ask me who I've studied with. I know that this is their way of de­termining my credentials and methodology, but I always have to be honest and say, The plants taught me. Some raise their eyebrows, smile fixedly, and move away. Some smile more deeply, and nod. Has there been a price for my involvement with the green­wights? Of course there is. In all worlds, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Some greenwights (like the Ancestral Fathers and Mothers) are bound to us as a species and are obligated to help us. Others simply like humanity and have a close relationship with it, or are healers of such power that they are spiritually obligated to heal when asked under the right circumstances. Still others are indifferent to humans and must be convinced to aid us. The green­wights have demanded that I be more aware of what I eat, espe­cially plant matter; they would prefer it if I only consumed organic fo od, a deal that I can't fully consummate yet but I am sincerely working toward. Genetically modified food is out of the question, and overly processed food is also an abomination to them. I have had to be mindful of what I harvest in the wild and how; what I feed to my livestock; what I throw out and where it goes. A picnic at a park may become waylaid by a greenwight who wants to talk to me, right now in the middle of the sandwiches. Another strange taboo they've laid on me, which will probably upset a good number of people, is that I cannot be a vegetarian fo r reasons of principle. If I required that sort of diet for health rea­sons, that would be one thing, but my body likes meat protein and does well on it. To the greenwights, saying that it is wrong to kill animals but right to kill plants would be privileging animals over plants, and a plant shaman can't do that. The carrot has as much reason to live as the cow, and is as necessary and worthy of respect when sacrificed so that we may live.

AND YET, WITH ALL THIS NATURAL LIVING, I NEVER FORGET that my body is a product of modern technology. I'm an intersexual, born with an endocrine system poised between male and female that exploded into a double puberty at age 13 . I was raised female and transitioned hormonally to male; I pass as male on the street, but between my legs and between my ears I am both male and female and always will be. I didn't understand why this was important to my future until I bled to death, quite literally, and Hela took me apart in an almost-hallucinogenic vision while I laying dying, and reconstructed me again ... differently. I can do things now that I couldn't do before, but none of those things are mine to use out­side of the job that She has set me. One of her most difficult orders was getting sex reassignment. I took testosterone, made by a large pharmaceutical company, and I will take it forever for the rest of my life. I don't like large phar­maceutical companies. To someone with my politics, they are a nightmare, and yet I'm bound to this path now.

AFTER TRANSITION, I found myself passing fully as male ... and I was told that I must wear skirts whenever I could safely get away with it, as a sign that I was still one of the Sacred Thirds. I am not allowed to choose one of the two ends of the gender continuum and stay there; I must claim the middle ground as my own. I can never fully be a part of woman's or men's space; I am the living an­chor for the alternative - a space where all genders are welcome, but the Thirds know best. Yo u don't have to be like us to be here, but pOll do have to like us - and pou do have to give up, however tempo­rarilp, the unifo rm and values of pour precious War.

As they were the only ones who ever came down to the river that divided the two camps, they were the only ones who realized that its waters were rising, and that everyone had to be herded into the same boat in order to survive the flood and save the human race. They took the lask on themselves, and thus saved the People. This is part of what we were born for, we who are destined to walk in both pairs of shoes. We are the sacred mediators, whether we like it or not. This is our job -to save humanity in spite of all the efforts of the men and women that make up most of it. My skirts symbolize my nature as two-spirited, and they also hide the very real bodily fact of my nature. It's not a theory or an archetype to me. What's between my legs is some of both, and it will stay that way. My Goddess has forbidden me to surgi­cally change my genitals to something wholly male-looking; even though the rest of me has been shapeshifted, that needs to stay Third. Even while I belong to neither side, I embody both in some way. In a very real way, my sex reassignment - from almost-female to almost-male - is my truest embodiment of the Gandhi quote at the beginning of this essay. I live as both, and I love as both - not figu­ral ively, but quite literally. My partner Bella is a male-to-female I ranssexual - are we heterosexual, or the same sex because we are both third? Who is the man and who the woman? My partner Joshua is female-to-male - we're definitely same-sex, but in whose ramp? I lie between them every night; what does that make me -besides very happy? Our love bypasses all of those boxes and labels. We don't try to claim them so much as we show how incomplete Ihey are, how irrelevant they are to our experience.

Still, we tell those stories, and we model this world, and we will continue to do so until we're dead. and this, too, is a great and terrible act of magic to change the world. THEN THERE'S THE OTHER BATTLE, THE DARK BATTLE. Once I won my sexuality back from gender dysphoria, I realized that it didn't look like most other people's sexual desires. I like the exchange of pain, of intensity. I like to be in control of other people, to run the show completely. I like terrifying my partners. Obviously, these urges could have been very bad had I allowed them to run wild, but I didn't. All sexualitJl is sacred, Pagans say... and does mine count in that category? Of course it does. There was the initial step of learning about BDSM, learning how to be safe, how to become a one-man adult haunted house that my lovers could use to go down into their personal Underworlds and rise again better for the experience, but soon this, too, became subsumed into my job. I became an Ordeal Master, designing rituals of passage for those who came to my door and requested them. The potential danger was, once again, harnessed into an act of redemption, potential poison used to heal. I take people down into their own darknesses, and scour them clean. I show them that authority does not have to mean corrup­tion, that pain does not have to mean wounding, that power-over does not have to mean abuse, so long as it is entered into with consent, mindfulness, and awareness of the sacred. It is a position simultaneously of great arrogance and great humility, a place of power roped into service to provide a place for ... service. And transformation, and purification, and honor. For this work, I needed a deity who could understand - and embody - the place where my sexuality comes from. That force walked into my life on clanking hooves, and his name was Baphomet. I get the feeling from reading various accounts that the side of Baphomet that I experience is very different from the Baphomet experienced by ceremonial magicians and chaos-magic types.

He embodies a sexuality that is dark and intense, even sadistic, but that is always dedicated to helping people attain a stronger knowledge of their selves, including the deepest, dark­est parts. And, of course, he embodies this in a form that is both male and female ... and highly sexual. Many androgynous deities are safely sexless; Baphomet is the opposite of both those words. He is also ruthless about making sure that I face my own dark­nesses in a useful way. It is said that anyone who would play Shiva the Destroyer must have a Kali to throw him down and tear his guts out, and while Hela performs that role for me in the rest of my life, when it comes to my sexuality - the part of me that has the greatest risk of becoming dangerous to others - Baphomet does the Kali role with implacable beauty - mentor, dominant, teacher of humility and arrogance, Rex Mundi. King of the World, this world, the world of flesh and blood and humus, of rot and growth and the eternal cycle of life. He is Lord of Perversions, taking that which others reject as monstrous and turning it into a tool of heal­ing. I am one of those tools. and this, too, is an act of magic to change the world. THE BEAUTY OF ALL THIS is that I didn't choose to do any of it to change the world. I chose every piece for other reasons, or the (;ods chose it for me and fo rced me to comply.

These are the words of a fellow traveller who, in his efforts to explore the worlds beyond the Tree of Life, came upon the Tower as an astral subject of initiation. It symbolises a journey, a battle, and the elevation from earth into air. Initiation is the art of living to realise one's full potential. and that always entails a battle, a battle of cosmic proportions. This essay attempts to explore parts of the initial battle of becoming, and the symbol that has appropriately lent itself to these explo­rations is the Tower. As a mere architectural construction it de­scribes a journey between top and bottom, but also elevation and the enhanced vision of one's surroundings. The esoteric Tower that will be the subject of this essay is an astral edifice, which has its entrance in the first Qliphothic sphere of Lilith leading through the tunnel of parfaxitas from the Samael Qlipha to A'arab Zaraq, towards the Sun-sphere of Thagirion. The Tower is constructed as vehicle that facilitates the movement from Tonal into nagual and the sorcerer who chooses to suffer its transport must rely on his own impeccable intent because he will find no rest here, no mercy.

According to the guardians of the Tower, the sorcerer must drink from the mouth of the spider to gain entrance to Bab-TIim, the gate of the gods. The theme of venom or poison connects the tunnels, leading from the earth-sphere (Le. Qulielfi), to the Samael Ql ipha, the poison of God, suggesting a gradual flow of mercurial gnosis trickling down to be distributed by the arachnid denizens of the lower tunnels and shells. This perceived interconnection between shells and tunnels also illuminates a point, which is not obvious when studying the traditional schematic of the Tree of Knowledge, namely that the sub-solar spheres and tunnels are not ordered and aligned according to a logical Euclidian geometry. The Ql iphoth is a coiling and winding web of interconnected laby­rinths. It is probably partly on account of the extreme tendencies of the journey through these surroundings that this path is called the Tower of Babel by the spirits that guard it; Babel, from the Hebrew balal: to confuse. Also this is a reference to the mythical endeavour of the hero, whom through surviving extreme hardship and difficult tests stands victorious, only to be misunderstood by his peers on his return from his adventures. The Ql iphothic initi­ate will face a similar ordeal as he enters his shadow and appear alien to non-initiates, as words will have new meanings to him as he has received a new view of existence from atop the Tower. The imager of the spider as a distributor of the maddening poi­son denotes the astral nature of the Tower. The spider weaves the web that constitutes the astral realms, and she is Namaah, the demonic ruler of the Lilith Ql ipha and the sister of Tubal Cain. Nimrod who descended from Tubal Cain is said to have built the Tower of Babel. but this myth is an indication of the angelic blood­line of the king rather than a reference to the history of archi­tecture. Like Tubal Cain, Nimrod was learned in the art of the Nephilim, the sexo-magical beings which Kenneth Grant connects to the tunnel of Pa rfaxitas, and which are attributed to the shell of A'arab Zaraq, according to the Qli phothic Qa balah. The witchcraft of the Nephilim is the lycanthropic gnosis of the Tower, through which the sorcerer is enabled to explore the sub-solar shells via lherinnthropic power symmetries, sorcerous re-enactments of the de mon-s pawning union of spirit and earth.

The atrium of the heart and its significance for the circulation of the blood corresponds to the pooling and circulation of vital energy via the subtle channels of the energetic body. The vital energy, the Red Dragon, is a vibratory force, which like the heart, uses pulse and rhythm to induce movement and stimulate the flow of life. The Atrium of the tower is where experiences and gnosis pooled, to then be used as fuel to propel the initiate towards the roof and rampart of the Tower. Samael is the poison and Gamaliel is the accursed chalice that holds it. The battle royal of the Tower ensues when the sorcerer reach­es the pinnacle and has to face the goetic duke Dantalion who, according to the Qliphothic Qabalah, corresponds to the A'arab Zaraq Ql ipha.

The relationship between Tower and cross constitutes a moving inwards, and as the initiate allows his perception to pierce deeper inwards, his consciousness simul­taneously expand to encompass more and more of his self. The mystical process of the Tower is symbolised by the cross as a vehicle of mag­ical transformation. The gnostic ascension of Jesus Christ and adins descent into Hel by means of self crucifixion is represented by the crossroad housed inside the Tower, a gateway to initiation and the solar realms beyond, because the sacrifice of the old self and the shamanic transmutation is the ethos proclaimed by the fallen angels that tend to the Tower. Esoteric symbolism alluding to the jour­ney through the Tower and the tunnel at its centre can be found in the traditional structures surrounding the metaphysical architecture and the context in which it is placed in this essay. Consider the symbols of the planets that correspond to the rele­vant shells on the Tree of Knowledge.

The composite planetary glyph of the tower also displays two aspects of the sorcerer; The lower aspect grounded in the earth sphere and the higher aspect which seems to be connected to the Sun. These two figures could be interpreted as the ego, acquired from living on the mundane plane and the more extensive Dremon nature, the Shadow or the Other, aspects of ones self which will have to be confronted and dealt with in the Tower, but also the divine poten­tial of the sorcerer, inspiring him to proceed. Another synchronicity, which is less tradi­tional, but all the more intriguing is the like­ness found in three sigils derived from the exploration of the Tower. The first seal is from the Goetia and it is that of Dantalion, a teacher and revealer of secrets, he knows man and can change him and carries a book Dantalion in his right hand. Analysing and compar-ing Dantalion's seal, in the light of initiatory experiences, to the oracular discourse of the spirits yields interesting perspectives. The most relevant part of the seal, to our gnosis, is undoubtedly the cross shape which is positioned on top of a horizontal line. The line below the cross could be seen as a metaphorical timeline where the initiate ascends, as portrayed by the shape of an ankh or cross on the left of the seal, through the cross and then transcends by means of its transformative powers. He is then propelled out­wards like a bolt of lightning with newly acquired gnosis as rep­resented by the crooked figure on the rightmost end of the line topped off by a circle. The theme of the lightning which radiates outwards instead of raining down from above, as is traditional in decks of the Tarot, is a characteristic found in the sigil represent­ing the tunnel of Parfaxitas as drawn by Thomas Karlsson in his book Qaba/ab, Qlipbotb and Goetic Magic. parfaxilas Karlsson, Qabala Qlipbotb & Goelic Magic parfaxilas Liber 2}1"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE TOWER OF BABEL This deviation is essential to the transformation facilitated by the Tower. The Tower represents the last outpost of the material world. It is the borderland between this reality and the greater; a reality beyond time and matter. In Liber 231, which Grant fre­quently refers to in his book Nigbtside of Eden, the seal of the Tower of Parfaxitas is surrounded by the words DEUS MUNDUS, God of this World and it is him, and the notion of his creation as an absolute Truth, which the sorcerer rejects as he metaphorically shifts his weight from one foot to the other and leaves some of his now useless, and perhaps worldly attributes behind as he proceeds to the top of the Qliphothic Tower. To some extent this discard­ing of old vices is a matter of magical and existential efficiency. The unrefined must be filed off for the sorcerer to achieve the Draconian Diamond state. This does not occur within the Tower, but it is rather here that the process of refinement begins. Sigil of the Ethos: The two other sigils mentioned previously along with that of Dantalion are channelled from forces inhabiting the Ql iphas that make up the Tower. They are connected yet separate, but perhaps they could be viewed as complementary pieces of a puzzle; the first an explanatory map of the ethos, and the second a praxis or method of engaging channelled by author the mystical principles of the first. The sigil of the ethos' pictorial elements display the tau cross overlaid by a crescent moon representing the Tree of Knowledge, the night­side of the Tree of Life. Via a coiling snake, which represents the initiators, the fallen angels, the tau cross is connected to an equal armed cross surrounded by four dots. This sigil could be seen as the means of establishing first contact with the spirit guardians of the Tower, assuming you are already walking the path of the Tree of Knowledge, otherise it would most probably have disas­trous consequences. The sigil depicting the praxis of the guardian spirits consists of crossbones surrounded by four skulls. The cross, as we have explained previously, represents the Tower, and the four skulls are its chief gu ardians. When forming an alliance with these spirits, as minutely detailed by Johnny Jakobsson in his es­say Le Grand Grimoire: pacta Conventa Dremoniorum, the sorcerer must approach them with utmost respect and the clearest intent if he is going to win their approval and protection. What they guard is not only an astral construct of initiation, but a whole tradition of witchcraft originating from within the Tower. 77"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"XVI Seal of the Guardians: channelled bp author The imagery of skulls and crossbones found in the seal of the guardians leads the imagination towards necromancy, a sorcerous art that is both diverse and misunderstood. The combination of cross and remains is not a rare one, but in this context it alludes to the most complex aspects of the journey through the Tower: initiation and transcendence through the trans mutability of death. The guardians liken this core mystery to Xon, an astral principle, spoken of by Thomas Karlsson in a book on astral travel not yet available in English. The Xon of the Tower is referred to as a black star who carries within it all that could be by those who keep its secrets. Thomas writes that Xon is a portal that leads in all direc­tions in time and space. Because it is beyond time and space it is the gateway to all worlds and places in time as well as space. According to Grant the tunnel of Saksaksalim, which constitutes the vertical axis of the Qliphothic cross, and that has a hanging man with his arms stretched out to form a cross in the middle of its sigil, is connected to the Hebrew letter Shin, the disintegrating principle of antimatter, and the Egyptian word Khpr, 'to trans­form', 'reverse', or 'regenerate the dead'. The necro-alchemical formula hidden in the reverse night (Nox-Xon) corresponds to the alchemical phase of nigredo, the blackening. This entails the dis­solution of the sorcerer and the disintegration of the Sephirotic Tower as the initiate approaches the Sol Niger to be reborn. The rune Hagal shares the same symbolism as the two sigils of the Tower and the seal of Dantalion, the route through the cross. It is the rune of Helheim, the world of Hel, to which Odin de­parted for nine days and nights as he sacrificed himself to himself through crucifixion on the World tree.

It is happening around us and it is happening within us. Our times are not merely interesting, they are outright apocalyptic. For these times there is one Goddess who speaks to us. Babalon, the city mirage image of Jerusalem, an infernal Roma, an Ephesus wormed with speaking catacombs and caves. She tells us not simply of the mysteries of sex and the battlefield of Love, but of War. It is high time to talk of war, as the storm clouds are spitting lightning whilst She dances. Even if you have not yet heard Her voice, then you will have seen the evidence of radical change in the world. But perhaps you are reluctant to accept the signs? To confront the fatal architecture we have put into place? This is the initiation of our sweet XVI. Why should we be fated to pass over the Tower like a reluctant tarot reader? Why fold it back into the pack, or undermine the meaning, when it is stark in silhouette and devastating in application? I sug­gest that we should consider in our death postures, in our dismem­berment and flesh melting meditations, the destruction of not only the Tower, but of the world by the resulting shockwaves. Few will dare to do this. Apocalypse is an idea mothballed with the Soviet warheads, with the Middle Ages, with the Revelation of John, in favour of the more comfortable illusions that flicker across the omnipresent thought-screens. Yet fire, as the alchemists knew, is a symbol of renewal, and this is what the Tower can bring us. My research has come up with clear reasons for what I term apocalppse denial in the realms of psychology and brain chemistry, which in turn gives us methods to defeat these internal censors. Next by examining the world and career of that great magician, Dr John Dee we can orientate ourselves in a tradition of both apoc­alypse and revelation. Understanding how the events around us in the physical world have a hidden or occult meaning, we can take the brave decision to apply this to our own times, to read the omens of the stars and the tides that influence all men, and to traf­fic with the entities who lie behind them. To confront the Tower, we must first be able to apprehend it in ourselves and our lives, to get real, rather than engage in idle speculation on Daath, however prettily lit with effulgent violet light. The inability to perceive impending disaster is what in psychol­ogy is termed norma/cp bias. This is the clinical reason why when people even in obvious danger, such as when the Titanic is listing, or a tsunami is sweeping in, or a building is on fire, refuse to believe that anything is wrong.

Notice how many people seem unable to understand what is happening around them, then watch their fate. They are struck with police batons, overwhelmed with flood and flame, mangled by the machinery of war, faces marked with a look of incredulity even as they are erased. This is normalcy bias in action. Our brains are simply not good at processing new informa­tion, they tell us that if something has never happened before, then it won't happen now, and that it is not happening already. We are staring at the end of civilisation, the extinction of our species and the death of life on earth; and this will be the fate of the majority of mankind, not running, not reacting, not saving themselves. It is not simply cynicism that defends itself, all our memes seek to preserve themselves, and if we do not consciously take charge of them, they are quite capable of killing their host. The script insists that everything is ok. That Babalon is not here. That there is no tiger in the long grass. We are especially vulnerable to slow moving well-camouflaged predators. The tiger is simply an indistinct movement in the dis­tance, perhaps it is nothing at all. Our attention wanders back to our everyday routine. We go back to grazing, flip channels, type in another google search. As every magician knows, it is difficult to maintain focus without the forced discipline of structured prac­tice. Even when the tiger erupts from the long grass and devours someone, normalcy bias councils us to lower our heads and keep grazing. To forget about it. To segregate it off as a single anoma­lous event. In our work with the Beast, we have discovered just how deeply set these behaviour patterns are. Man has a history of being prey. Normalcy bias is a particular problem when dealing with more metaphysical threats to the species. A good example of this is cli­mate change. Unless you live in a frontline environment, the threat is abstract. It is a tiger that has been utterly broken up by the mazy overlap of stripes and shadows. Normalcy bias blinds us to it. When a disaster does occur it is normalcy bias which makes it a single anomalous event. This is even easier if it occurs to people with different coloured skin on another part of our small globe. The role of the magician is not initially to be the tiger, but first to see the tiger. To recognise patterns, to replicate patterns, and then to change them. An important concept here is the martial one of being open on all eight sides. A totem to consider for this work is the spider, useful in both moving and sitting meditation.

However, this requires the practitioner to place themselves in extreme states rather than the complicit paired practice we find in many martial schools. We must train with intent and under stress, or we will be unable to respond to a real situation. In our magickal work with Babalon and the Beast there is a similar shamanic process of embodying these chimreric predator forms. This internal alchemy and control of the endocrine system can lead to a state of breakdown, madness, or an awakened kun­dalini. Sex is not the starting point in working with Babalon, sex is the ultimate battleground, the final proving place of our alchemi­cal prowess.

This means gaining control of what are ostensibly un­conscious processes. The intellectual development of Will is not enough. Physical practice is needed. The chemistry is simple to explain. If we feel out of control in a stress situation the body drops cortisol. This leads to a flood of corticosteroids which effectively creates a short circuit in the brain. It blocks the ability to link changes in behaviour with de­sired outcomes. Flexible and responsive behaviour is replaced with automatic actions. The immune system crashes and the body folds in on itself. We are in essence preparing to be devoured. By internal alchemy we can avoid being prey items by extend­ing our control over stress situations.

It was in fact a gritty and driven attempt to navigate through a world in utter crisis. It is a world which we have inherited today. We cannot hope to understand, (let alone perform) Enochian magic unless we realise that it is profoundly apocalyptic in both conception and ac­tion. John Dee was inundated with unwelcome visions. The Angel Murifri tells him: The earth laboureth as sick, yea, sick unto death. The wa­ters pour forth weepings and have not moisture sufficient to quench their own sorrows. The air withereth, for her heat is infected. The fire consumeth and is scalded with his own heat. The Bodies above are ready to say, We are weary of our courses.

Hell itself is weary of earth: for why?

The baleful comet of 1577 further unnerved Europe. Tycho Brahe determined the comet was in the sphere of Ve nus, and saw it as a harbinger of warfare, pestilence, and ex­tremes of heat and cold as well as changes in religion. His student Johannes Kepler said that it predicted the appearance in the north of Europe of a prince who should lay waste all Germany, and then vanish in 1632. This prophecy was fulfilled with eerie precision. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden subsequently unleashed the Thirty Ye ars' War and died in timely fashion in the year 1632. The scien­tific significance of the comet is that observations showed it was above the moon and the sub-lunar sphere rather than a meteoro­logical phenomena as comets were previously thought to be. The Aristotelian model of the universe lay smashed. John Dee spent three days counselling the Queen on the comet's meaning. It is perhaps here that the lunar venusian cult of Elizabeth began in earnest. But Elizabeth, the virgin whore with her red hair, decked in gold and pearls and precious stones seems more reminiscent of Revelations than Dee ever acknowledged. It is the stellar crises combined with social, religious and en­vironmental upheaval which drove Dee after the angels and into the riddling symbolic language of the Biblical Prophets and Revelations. In 1581 Dee began working with the scryer Edward Kelley. The nature of the work was richly apocalyptic. When Kelley has his vision of the Watchtowers the colours of the directions are the colours of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

The Revelations' refining fire also forged a particular linguistic bond: the habitual association of the word \"apocalypse\" with the spectacular and destructive imagery of the Revelation of John, branding Western civilization with an indel­ible Mark. It combined the eschatological. moral dualism of the ancient persian Zoroastrians with the xenophobic fantasia and persecution complexes of the whole genre of Jewish apocalypti­cism. All subsequent visions of the End of the Age have paid their tribute to the chimerical apocalyptic Beast, occasionally bowing down and worshiping it outright. While \"apocalypse\" has become sweetly familiar on the tongue to most, it may nevertheless stir a bitterness in the belly and a similar discomfiture of mind in those acquainted with the origins and progress of dualism. The civilization over which the Beast has reigned exhibits a similarly chimerical and fantastic origin to Christianity itself. de­scribed by English metahistorian Arnold J. Toynbee as \"Hellenized Judaism,\"1 and like a chimerical creature whose dissimilar heads adorn an equally incongruous body, the \"Western\" civilization maintains a persistent identity crisis. It shares, in Toynbee's list of thirty world civilizations, its directional categorization with only one other, the \"Far Eastern,\" with the rest of the civilizations being named by Toynbee for the peoples, regional cultures, or religious world-views which generated them. The problems of Western civilization's origins, nature, and iden­tity pertain not only to the genesis, persistence, and relevance of apocalyptic belief in its own context, but also to the many other civilizations influenced by apocalyptic, eschatologicaL or millenarian ideas, or even by widespread \"Western\" power and dominance. Thus, understanding the significance of the \"West\" and its self-conception is a critical project. Despite the civiliza­tion's Christian origins, it cannot have been labelled, or even con­sidered, a \"Christian\" civilization since the Enlightenment, and amongst its elites, not since the Renaissance.

Spengler considered \"civiliza­tion\" to be the phase of outwardly directed, materially oriented decadence which signals the death of the creative impulses of a culture; the beginning of an unavoidable decline. He originated the name \"Faustian\" to describe the civilization that emerged from \"Western\" culture, referring to its insatiable drive to conquer the horizon. However, the name has the disadvantage of Germanic and chronological bias: \"Western\" civilization (and culture) had all of its defining features long before Georg Faust struck a deal with Mephistopheles. While Toynbee treated Mesopotamian civilization, Islamic civili­zation, and Arabic civilization as distinct but related entities (and did not maintain, did Spengler, that civilization necessarily sig­nalled the decline of culture), it was Spengler who first noted that these Middle-Eastern civilizations were not free of the ambigui­ties of religion and identity which persisted in the Western civi­lization originated by the religious preoccupations of \"Hellenized Jews\" (and, reciprocally, Christianized Romans; that is, Judaized Hellenists) . According to Spengler's interpretation, denizens of the civilizations of the Middle-East, since the success of the Persian empire, would parallel the aforementioned post-Roman Judaized Hellenists as \"Iranized Chaldaeans.\" This inspired Spengler to call their culture \"Magian,\" after the mysterious Medean priests who appear to have converted to Zoroastrianism sometime during the establishment of the first Persian Empire. In Spengler's view, the \"Magian civilization\" suffered what he called a \"pseudomorphosis\" with the domination of the near and western middle east by the Byzantine Empire. In such a \"pseudomorphosis,\" the creative im­pulses of a given civilization are distorted by the dominating intlu­ence of another, forcing outward conformity while simultaneously pressuring its process of self-preservation into unusually subtle fo rms. With this, Spengler contextualizes the rise of Islam, its later adoption by the Ottomans as a religion of empire, and -propheti­c(llly -the current relationship between the Islamic world (lnd the West. Toynbee adapted Spengler's concept of pseudomorphosis to the whole process of Western colonialism and dominance, sug­gesting that, should Western civilization develop (Ill imperi(ll \"uni­vers(ll st(lte\" instead of an organic, universalist global civiliz(llion, world-wide pseudomorphosis could result. .'

First, it may be misleading, since the Classical civilization also had, originally, a European origin and identity, and there is no reason Europe could not give rise, or have given rise to, another or different civilization. Second, a main theme of \"Western\" civilization has been its lack of coherent European identity. Nevertheless, European at least does not have the numerous disadvantages of \"Western: which seems to obscure the intended meaning as much as elucidate it. Israeli sociologist Shmuel Noel Eisenstadt prefers \"European\"3 as a designation for the civilization emerging between the Classical and the \"modern,\" a new civilization he summarizes as being defined, in part, by the belief in \"progress.\" This view appears compatible with the model of Italian esotericist Julius Evola, who held that the modern West differs from all its predecessors in promoting a \"progressive\" rath­er than the cyclical model of history, which resembles an \"Eternal Return\" more than a linear increase of technological advance.' It was Evola who introduced the concept of Occult War into the wider discourse of occultism and esotericism, a critical event to be considered later. In contrast to \"European,\" \"EuRoman,\" as a reference for the civilization generally known as \"Western,\" is more precise. This is partly due to being a neologism, having the simultaneous advan­tage and disadvantage that the accuracy of its meaning depends on the correctness of the argument that I am making here: the civi­lization's original identity was defined by the combination of sur­viving Roman legal. political. and religious structures with \"bar­barian\" tribal cultures of Europe. \"Romano-Germanic\" would be a specific and more obvious name, but the Celtic contribution was as prominent as the Germanic, particularly in France and Britain, making \"Romano-Germanic\" culturally biased. 1 S.

Therefore, far from being an indispensable pa­rental element of the civilization, Judaeo-Christian identity (the result of a foreign religion no more inherently necessary to this cultural genesis than any of its competitors such as Gnosticism, Mithraism, Stoicim, and so forth) has been a cause of both pseudo­morphosis and its consequence, cultural distortion. Toynbee pro­vides many persuasive reasons why Christianity was victorious, and why competitors such as the ones I have previously mentioned fa iled to catalyze the genesis of a new culture and civilization, but this does not mean that Christianity was somehow pre-destined to form the best of all possible \"Universal Churches\" for the emer­!�ent \"EuRomans.\" Similarly, it does not make the Judaeo-Christian influence any less distortionate than was the apparently inevitable dominance of the Eastern Roman Empire over the Middle-East, a dominance which contributed heavily to the pseudomorphosis of t he latter's civilizations. Even if the idea promoted by Spengler and Toynbee that civiliza­t ions can be considered to be wholly distinct entities is rej ected,' the modern \"West\" undeniably exhibits significant disparity from other cultural forms. If the \"modern West\" is taken as the ultimate consequence of the development of a unitary \"civilization,\" it rep­resents the total victory of that civilizational form over any culture (such as a European one) which may have preceded it in the West.

This suggests that the secularized, progressive civilization now called \"Western\" (which could be called Modern Secular) may be distinct from the \"EuRoman,\" and have the attributes of a \"meta-civiliza­tion.\" (Modernism might then be taken as a EuRoman \"universal religion: with Marxism-Leninism as an example of a \"Universal Church\" based upon its tenets,) Eisenstadt traces the origins of modernity prior to the formation of EuRoman civilization to the so-called \"Axial Age,\" midway through the last millennium BeE, which saw the emergence of Hellenic philosophy, Jewish mono­theism, Buddhism, and related transcendentalist movements. He suggests that during the European reactions against Christianity, Axial transcendentalism was inverted into an immanentist, this­worldly form expressed in such phenomena as a concern with per­sonal autonomy, rationalistic science, protest as a political mode, and the idea of universal human rights. This modernity seems to have expressed itself in two ways: the first is a direct imposi­tion of \"modern EuRoman\" ideas and civilizational attributes on the rest of the world, as through colonialism, imperialism, and the aggressive spread of its modern socio-political and cultural ideologies; the second expression of this modernity, however, is fully meta-civilizationaL allowing it to combine with anti-Western, anti-European agendas and ideologies. American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, author of The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order' observes that non-Western societies are frequently able to accept modernity and its innovations, par­ticularly technological, without accepting any of the ideological characteristics of the \"West.\" Concepts such as the \"Axial Age\" and \"modernity\" introduce distinction not only laterally - between civilizations and cultures -but temporally, between one phase of a civilization's development and another.

Aeon originally referred to an unmeasured period of time, one meaning of which implied a \"phase,\" but which was more popularly ascribed to successive divine emanations in the Gnostic cults. The association of the term aeon to historical pe­riods, which can be correlated to astrological ages or theological dispensations (such as the Three Ages of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit described by Calabrian abbot Joachim of Fiore (1135-1202), a conception that later influenced the Rosicrucian movement), was significantly established by Aleister Crowley and continued by Carl Gustav Jung. Crowley gives no explanation for his adoption of aeon to refer to a two-thou sand-year long divine dispensation, but Jung associates aian with the lion-headed form of the Demiurge apparently identified by the Mithraic mystery cult with Deus i\\remanius, a \"Satanic\" God of This World. Perhaps this figure was being conflated by the Mithraic cult and other increasingly I ra n scendentalist, Hellenistic syncretic systems, with the Iranian \"Zu rvan\" figure, an ambivalent, Abraxas-like time god. (The name i\\brnxas enumerates to 365 in Greek stoicheia, in which each letter equals a numerical value. Thus he was an embodiment of the cycle of Ihe year.) One explanation for this identification of a diaboli­ral figure with the Zurvanic time god, is the similar associations of Saturn with time as well as death, restriction, and opposition. The Manichaeans, a Middle-Eastern transcendentalist Gnostic rhurch, inverted the Zoroastrian devil Ahriman from a spiritu­nlly evil, world-opposing power to a materially evil Gnostic-style world oppressing \"archon\" figure. The Manichaeans were clearly inlluellced by Iranian dualism, and the Classical Greeks, as early i1� Ilerodotus, had identified Ahriman with Hades. The Gnostic milieu identified this physical cosmos with \"Hell,\" opening several nVl'nues by which the originally spiritually transcendent concept of the tlean could come to be associated with the world-ruling time god. Perhaps less anti-cosmic cults (like the Mithraists) considered Ihl' Demiurge to be (as in a Platonic interpretation) a lower, or ('WIl the lowest, \"aeonic\" manifestation, but not wholly inimical.

It was in the personality of Basilides that Carl Jung wrote the Seven Sermons to the Dead, in which Abraxas \"begetteth truth and lying, good and evil, light and dark­ness, in the same word and in the same act.\"9 On whatever esoteric basis the association was made, modern occultism now generally identifies the aeon with the zeitgeist, and various aeonic models more historically sound than that of Crowley have been proposed. In the late 1970S, Peter J. Carroll, a founder of the Illuminates of Thaneteros (lOT), the influential magical order which was first to promote the \"chaos current,\" presented a global aeonic model focused on the cyclical return of magical thought. At indetermi­nate date, the Order of Nine Angles (aNA), a significant group in the \"Traditional\" Satanic movement, elaborated a civilizational aeonic model concerning itself with the development of magical consciousness. In Liber Null and pSJ?chonaut (1987),'° Carroll presented a suc­cession of five global aeons instead of Crowley's three (which were \"Isis,\" the age of matriarchy, \"Osiris,\" the age of patriarchy, and \"Horus,\" the \"New\" Aeon of the \"Crowned and Conquering\" Child). Carroll rejected the ahistorical propositions of Crowley, which are reminiscent of an attempt to combine the theories of Swiss anthro­pologist J.J. Bachofen concerning ancient matriarchy and its sup­plantation by the patriarchy,\" with the three ages of Joachim. In contrast, Carroll proposed a schema of aeons based on the interac­tions of magical world-views with religious and materialistic ones. The first aeon was animistic, akin to the \"Dreamtime.\" A shamanic transition gave way to a polytheistic, agrarian aeon, followed by monotheism, rational materialism, and ultimately \"chaoism,\" a re­turn to the purely magical conception of animism, but upgraded by science and technology. Although it recognizes technologicnl progress, the model is in fact cyclical, since chaoism will give way to a peak of pure magical dominance, followed by some unimag­ineable new priesthood, which will eventually achieve monotheist ascendance and then be overcome by a return to rationalism, con­tinuing a never-ending process. Although he presents a doctrine of cycles, as do Spengler and Toynbee, Carroll's aeonic model seems more compatible with McNeill's conception of a progressively advancing global web of l) hll p://www.gnosis.org/libmryI7Scrmolls.hllll 10 I'eler,.

Despite this compatibility with McNeill's global per­spective, it would not be difficult to apply Carroll's model to dif­ferent phases within different civilizations, such that the Islamic civilization would currently be between monotheist and rational­ist, whilst some tribal civilizations are probably still animist or shamanic. A problem with this application, however, is the pos­sibility that non-rationalist societies can make full use of \"mate­rialist\" technology. Yet, such a multi-civilizational model also has an advantage, since it could explain how a technological society could experience a cyclical return to religion. Until a complete cycle can be observed on a global scale, however, such a model remains speculative. The aeonic model proposed by the Order of Nine Angles dem­onstrates significant influence from Spengler and Toynbee, par­ticularly with regard to its attention to the periodic rise and fall of civilizations.\" The ONA's magical system is based on the sev­en classical planets (plus two more esoteric concepts, being the \"acausal\" dimension of consciousness and the chaotic \"abyss\" which underlies the totality of the whole system) and so it is \"sep­tenary.\" It has stellar correspondences and proposes seven aeons, each associated to a given civilization and its ethos, magical tech­nique, and symbol. An \"aeon\" is understood to be a manifestation of acausality within the causal (ordinary physical) universe which lasts about two thousand years, giving rise after the first five hu n­dred or so years to an associated \"aeonic civilization\" which is a \"nexion,\" a \"presencing\" or gateway, of acausal power. Sentient be­ings are understood to be manifestations of acausality within the causal. and the more conscious they are, the more they presence it; therefore, aeonic civilizations represent further developments of consciousness. The aim of following the \"sinister\" way of the ONA, which opposes moral dualism and unconscious inertia, is the achievement of total acausal consciousness while living, free­ing oneself of the limitations on consciousness particular to one's own aeon and its archetypes and patterns, and therefore becom­ing ultimately able to independently retain individuated conscious awareness in the acausal as an immortal being. \"Aeonically,\" the ONA promotes the furtherance of human consciousness into tran­shuman conditions suitable to the eventual achievement of space t ravel in a galactic civilization culminating the next aeon. 11 Hdcl'encc� to ON/\\ doctrincs hcrc arl' taken from a variety of ON/\\ nHlIHI�cripts,l1lost of which arc intermittl'ntly availahlt, onlinl' in a variety of localion�. ttl\\"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"XVI There are similarities, but also significant differences, between the aeonic models of the ONA and the lOT. According to the ONA, the first aeon is called \"Primal,\" symbolized by the horned beast and characterized by shamanism, originating around 9000 years ago. This Primal aeon resembles a combination of Carroll's animistic aeon and its shamanic transition, and it has no known associated civilization or ethos. The ONA's second aeon, called \"Hyperborean,\" is associated with a civilization they designate as \"Albion\" and its henge culture. The chaoist model does not propose an intervening aeon between the shamanic transition and pagan polytheism. The third and fourth ONA aeons, corresponding to the Mesopotamian and Hellenistic civilizations respectively, do correlate to the pagan aeon of the chaoist model. Carroll's model describes the current aeon as transitioning be­tween rational materialism and chaoism. In contrast, the ONA presents the current aeon, which they call the \"Thorian\" and define as beginning a thousand years ago, as one of Faustian transgres­sion similar in tone to Spengler's conception of the \"Faustian\" civi­lization. The ONA considers its ethos to be \"National Socialism,\" based on their conception of honor, duty, and loyalty, and to which they ascribe an impetus toward a Galactic Empire predicted and promoted for the forthcoming aeon. Chaoist aeonics agrees with the prospect of an interstellar civilization but proposes its ethos to be in accord with the libertarian values and flexible belief charac­terizing contemporary post-modern globalism. A source more chronologically and ideologically proximate than Spengler for the ONA's conception of National Socialist aeonic opposition to perceived Magian cultural distortion is American Na zi Francis Pa rker Yockey, author of Imperium: Tbe Pbilosopb!! of Histor!! and Politics (1948). Yockey perceived the United States to be entirely corrupted by Magians, yet believed Stalinism had ulti­mately turned against Magian influence behind the Iron Curtain. He proposed that the greatest enemy of Europe was not commu­nism but rather Judaeo-American capitalist power, and he desired that Orthodox civilization would overcome communism without foreign intervention, particularly if the Cold War ended in its favor. While that conflict's conclusion may have inspired Francis rukuyama to proclaim the \"end of history,\" it seems to have lacked the spectacularly \"apocalyptic\" eschatological resolution expected by Magian dualists.

New configurations of dualist extremism and millenarian eschatological radicalism continue to emerge and threaten apocalyptic manifestation, perhaps even in the territory where the Magian pseudomorphosis propagated and the apocalyp­tic concept originated. THE OCCULT WAR DURING THE POST-WAR ERA leading into the Cold War, Giulio Cesare Evola (1898-1974) introduced the concept of occult war into esoteric discourse, beyond the milieu of reactionary political and racial conservatism. In that milieu, it was first introduced by Vicomte Leon de Poncins (1897-1976), an anti-Masonic, anti-Jewish French Catholic. De Poncins translated and published in French a work entitled La Guerre Occulte (1936), authored by Russo­Polish emigre Emanuel Malynsky, another ultra-conservative Catholic anti-Semite. The work elaborated the allegedly nefarious schemes of \"International Jewry,\" later regarded as a primary arm of \"Magian\" influence by Yockey. Malynsky predicted that such schemes would first quash Russia's hope for world power and then culminate in the final destruction of socialism in Russia, leaving hegemonic Judaeo-American capitalism as the final victor. Such pessimism seemed suitable to the similarly deterministic Evola, who translated the work into Italian in 1939. Evolian Traditionalism presents an aeonic model, but it does not exclusively refer to the world ages as \"aeons.\" It rather adopts the archaic IndO-European concept of the Four Ages, implicitly accept­ing a Spenglerian, Toynbee-like proposition that individual cul­tures and civilizations are distinct entities, and thus refers mainly to the mythic concepts of its own cultural origins, informed by comparative reference to others. In the Indo-European mod('\\. after the Primordial Age of unfettered magical and divine con­sciousness, culture is described as having progressively degener­ated from Gold to Silver to Bronze to Iron. The apocalyptic vi­sion in Daniel 2:31 describing the statue fashioned of these fo ur increasingly inferior metals descending to \"feet of clay\" indicates the reception of this tradition by Babylon from persia, il nd thus its transmission to the Jews.

This quaternary schema correlates with the doctrine of the four castes as maintained in India, with each caste or \"estate,\" as they are called in the West, reigning over the corresponding age. According to this tradition, civilization is currently in the Iron Age, destined for rule by serfs and ultimately by slaves, leading Evola to a different prediction than that of Malynsky: the ultimate victory of Bolshevism over capitalism. Traditionalists could now propose that agents of capi­talism have managed to cling to power somehow through further cultural distortion, that ultimately \"state capitalism\" will be more like Stalinist totalitarianism or \"Chinese communism,\" or that ul­timately humanity will be reduced to such a slave-like condition that the reign of the Fourth Estate will come about automatically. The final devolution of the Iron Age, the \"Kali Yuga\" in the Ve dic terminology, culminates with the reign of outcastes, organized into criminal cartels akin to the infamous thugees. According to Traditional doctrines, the last avatar of Vishnu, Kalki, will purify the world at the end of the Yuga and restore the Golden Age. Some of the most pessimistic Traditionalists consider this redemption to be either contingent, or unlikely. Kalki is identified by some of the Traditional Satanic groups as a being called \"Vindex,\" an inspired military leader who is predicted to arise and destroy the Magian­infested \"Western\" civilization. Some of the \"aeonic magic\" of these groups is dedicated to manifesting this being. Evola's esoteric and occult history is complex. His early interest in nihilism and Dadaism led to a focused study of Hermetic, al­chemical. yogic, tantric, and Vajrayana magical systems. Adopting a Traditional worldview, he supported the Axis powers, but tend­ed to criticize their politics from the Right, often seeing them as insufficiently elitist, non-aristocratic, and too influenced by the characteristics of the mass movement. He condemned the Catholic Church and criticized Mussolini's allegiance with it. He preferred National Socialist Germany to Fascist Italy, yet his appearance of individualism and association with the type of aristocrats who later conspired in the July plot against Hitler contributed to the SS mistrusting him. They nevertheless enlisted his occult knowl­edge in researching Freemasonry. He criticized the materialism of National Socialist racial theory and was ultimately invited by Mussolini to expound an esoteric racial doctrine suitable to Fascism. Evola proposed that in addition to physical race, each person was endowed with a particular race of soul and spirit. This 10(,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"OCCULT WAR FOR THE lEON classification method could be interpreted both inclusively and ex­clusively, in that although certain non-Aryans might have Aryan souls or spirits, many Aryans in a Judaized society would have Jewish souls and/or spirits.') Evola probably intended these clas­sifications to be used in the most elitist way, to exclude rather than include, though Mussolini may have seen the opposite potential . Despite his criticisms of Mussolini, Evola supported the German attempt to rescue him from Allied captivity and was there to greet him when he returned to Italy after his liberation. Traditionalism totally condemns modernity and the concept of progress as entirely opposed to the maintenance of traditional val­ues. As a Traditionalist, Evola advocated a \"revolt against the mod­ern world\" in his work of that name published in 1934. When the revolt offered by the Axis powers failed, he attempted to elaborate a suitable strategy of resistance in Men Among the Ruins (1953). After setting out an entire socio-political program of deliberately reactionary aim, he defines the \"occult war\" : The occult war is a battle that is waged imperceptibly by the forces of global subversion, with means and in circum­stances ignored by current historiography. The notion of oc­cult war belongs to a three-dimensional view of history: this view does not regard as essential the two superficial dimen­sions of time and space (which include causes, facts, and vis­ible leaders) but rather emphasizes the dimension of depth, or the \"subterranean\" dimension in which forces and influ­ences often act in a decisive manner, and which, more often not than not, cannot be reduced to what is merely human, whether at an individual or a collective level.'· Evola concentrates on the strategies and tactics of the powers that he considers to be acting on behalf of the \"counter-initiation,\" whose proponents and aims are akin to the Traditional Satanic understanding of the \"Magian.\" In his examination of their meth­ods, he proposes that exclusively positivist explanations of his­tory are promoted by anti-traditional fo rces in order to concenl 1\\ Juliug Evob, Sintes i Dottrina della Razza (Milan: Hocpli. 1941). !'irst English tranglation Elements of Racial Education (Quimpcr: Thompkins & Cariou, 200,). 14 Julius Evola, Men IImong the I/uins (Rochester, Vl'l'monl: Innel' 'i'l'llllil ions, 1(02). p. 2<;1.l'ir sl published eli uOIl1;ni c Ie rovim' (Home: Edizioni Mediterrrance, 1<),1). 107"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"XVI themselves. In instances when such obscurations are penetrated, Evola asserts that a tactic of replacement is used by the counter­initiation, in which some imagined, theoretical. or philosophically conceived agency or force is proposed as a cover. An example is the tactic of counterfe its, which presents subtly distorted symbols that would originally have been traditionally appropriate. These distorted symbols can then be attacked, criticized, and negated convincingly. Evola describes the concept of \"traditionalism\" itself as deliberately misdefined and promoted as an adherence to out­worn customs, allowing Tradition to be similarly derided as anach­ronism. Another tactic he considers is the tactic of inversion, in which the opposite of a given value is presented in its place. The tactic of ricochet is related, utilized when traditional forces are ma­nipulated in such a way that they attack other traditional forces, leading to disunity which can then be exploited. As a historical example, he mentions the consequences of regimes attempting to benefit themselves by promoting revolution against rival regimes and thereby ultimately undermining themselves. The tactic of di­lution is a particular aspect of the tactic of surrogates, in which traditional forces are weakened by being led into the promotion of a return to previously vanquished forms that were already flawed, such as the profane \"nationalism\" opposed by revolutionaries but still in itself insufficiently Traditional. A direct tactic is the tac­tic of misidentification, in which unworthy representatives of a principle, such as monarchy, are attacked as the principle itself. Finally, he describes infiltration, in which members of a traditional organization abandon its spiritual foundation and allow it to be taken over by the counter-initiation from within. Evola considers \"unconditional loyalty to an idea\" as the only defence against oc­cult war tactics. By 1961, Evola had lost confidence in active revolution, and pro­moted a detached indifference to modernity, proposing that the differentiated man of Tradition should \"ride\" the momentum of the age, as in an Eastern aphorism in which one rides a tiger to exhaustion.\" Such may be a parallel to the Mithraic tauroctony, the bull being slain once its inertial energy has been spent. Evola regarded the forces of Tradition as primarily defensive against the nggressively distortionate \"counter-initiation,\" which seeks to un­dennine differentiation and discriminating consciousness. l'i lui ius Evola.

It is, however, at least pos­sible in theorr that a historian (for example) could arrive at an ob­jective historical conclusion about something. That the Normans invaded Britain in 1066 is no more objective a statement than that Napolean engaged in his campaigns of imperial conquest solely motivated by an urge to compensate fOT his stature; rather, the lat­ter statement is objectively wrong. This is not to say that a totally subjective statement cannot be made about history, or that such a statement could not have an effect (for example, a magical one). For example, the assertion that the Enochian conversations of Dr. John Dee was an instrumental factor in the ultimate ascendancy of the British Empire and the globalization of English would be a subjective assertion about aeonic history, since it refers strictly to the allegedly acausal influences of the angels. Its \"truth,\" should it have any, is dependent on the power (either predictive or ma­nipulative) that it gives (if any), rather than its accurate correspond­ence to realitr. This is an example of Lionel Snell's observation that while both science and magic are useful because of what they do rather than what they are; the former case functions by providing objective correspondence and the latter case subjective power. That this power might be exercised in the causal, objective domain, or not, is irrelevant to the definition. To continue the example for completeness, an assertion that the Enochian God, lada, is the supreme Demiurge and that Britain rose to global supremacy at his will (or even that the non-omnipotent but still mighty lada defeated his diabolical rivals who sponsored Britain's catholic en­emies, causing his victory to be reflected on earth), is a religious assertion, as it is both objective in its intent (Iada and his divine/ diabolical enemies are alleged to be real), and collective rather than individual as is science (which depends solely on the single experi­menter or observer, although his observations ought to be repeat­able). These examples show how the \"science\" of history is perhaps more easily subverted by magic than would be a \"hard\" science which has experimental procedures for screening out the observer effect. It also shows why it is difficult for religion to dominate the hard sciences, since they are competing models of objective reality. (This, tangentially, suggests that a \"true\" religion would be one which could be unfailingly agreed upon by, or imposed onto, all believers collectively, without ever contradicting objective sci­ence, perhaps explaining the appeal of twentieth-century political religions.)

(Religious \"subversion\" of history tends to be subjective and \"magical\" in its style, compe­tently so or not.) These points may be more obvious when compar­ing history to art about history (art being subjective but collective, at least in how it is received and appreciated). Most people can intuitively understand the difference between, for example, an historical film and a history textbook; the very concepts \"artistic license\" and \"historical accuracy\" where these arts are concerned illustrates it nicely. The foregoing suggests that while choice of reonic model is magical and subjective, its applicability and accuracy in a histori­cal sense is an objective matter. As such, sufficient understanding of the current scenario and its historical causes and conditions should allow the effective evaluation of how these reonic ideas are being used and promoted, even if the historian cannot pass judg­ment (as a historian) on their aims or the worth of their magical context. An objective historical vantage point may, however, also allow a more useful comparison and contrast to be made between different magical, aeonic schemes and their apparent historical relevance. Assuming one accepts that the post-EuRoman \"super­civilization\" will successfully globalize its post-modern, post-ma­terialist, neo-liberal characteristics, chaoist reonics appear to be plausible. Considering the extent to which most Traditionalists, Radical or otherwise, consider \"progress\" so-called to be inevita­ble, their systems would also readily accept the eventual ascend­ancy of \"chaos\" reonically, although with less enthusiasm. As sllch, those who wish to consider an alternative to global post-modern super-civilization, whether as a historical thought-experiment or an actual aeonic agenda, would be advised to consider what aeonic models best fit with Toynbee's less deterministic, multi-civiliza­tional schema. While the ideas of the Order of Nine Angles were influenced by Toynbee's concepts of civilization and empire, their sevenfold reonic pattern is clearly less so, since although it propos­es that not all civilizations are \"reonic,\" it still presents a linear and global view. However, \"EuRoman\" civilization, in whatever form, seems to have abandoned the more civilizationally traditional path to totalitarian despotism in favour of global super-civilization. III"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"XVI Any attempt to evaluate magical reonics historically must take this into account. If models of cyclical patterns in history are accurate, it can­not be clear before the fact that \"super-civilizations\" are subject to exactly the same patterns as ordinary civilizations. It does, however, seem apparent that there is no indication that cultural distortion corrects itself when passing from one civilization to another. Rather, it seems to worsen with transmission, given that Christian EuRoman civilization is objectively (according to the re­vision of Spengler and Toynbee's models being implied here) more \"distorted\" and pseudomorphic than any of the \"Magian\" cultures and civilizations. Therefore, any super-civilization progenated by an already distorted, pseudomorphic civilization will be even more distorted. The historical pattern of which we can be certain, barring cataclysmic/apocalyptic interruptions is that science and technology will continue to advance exponentially. The destruc­tion of Euroman civilization could only interrupt its progress. The only \"pattern\" that can be expected in the transition to super­civilization is an increase in technological sophistication. All the aeonic models considered so far either specifically accord with this observation, or do not contradict it; this does not necessarily mean a continuity or increase in materialism. Aeonics can then be historically re-considered based upon present uncertainties and possible responses and outcomes, given that according to cyclical, deterministic, local, and global models, there is agreement that the current \"reon\" or phase is nearing, but not at, its conclusion. It seems reasonable to accept this \"aeon\" as a rationalist one dominated by the concerns of scientific progress, and reasonable to recognize that this development originated in the \"EuRoman\" civilization. Modern EuRoman civilization might achieve global status, and assimilate or va nquish all of its competitors. It might, conversely, fa il to do this. Such a failure will mean its death, its reversion to a non-imperial phase (perhaps avoiding globalisation would also prevent lapsing into a grandiose but probably terminal scenario of New EuRoman Empire), or its actualization of such an Empire on some non-global scale. Any of these cases might or might not con­tinue to perpetuate the cultural distortion induced by the Christian Pseudomorphosis. Pseudomorphosis, by definition, is toxic not only to thc distorted civilization, but also to other civilizations which it influcnces. Thus, the one concern which both \"globa[\" and \"lo_ cal\" focused reonic magicians could probably agree upon is that to 112"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"OCCULT WAR fOR THE lEON the extent modern EuRoman civilization is distorted, it is inimical to them personally and to everyone generally. For those who are totally affiliated with or identified with it, or those who primarily value uninterrupted technological progress, this seems to present significant complications where the practice of reonic magic is concerned. From a metahistorical perspective, the most objective and rational aeonic magical systems for EuRoman people will be those which act to correct the distortion to the civilization as ex­pediently as possible. As this is neither possible nor significant to agents outside the civilization, such non-Euroman reonists would be likely to instead work to undermine, destroy, or oppose that so­ciety. Huntington's model of the Clash of Civilizations has relevance here, as does his implication that the modern meta-civilization of technological progress is different than the modern \"EuRoman\" civilization which may spawn it. As such, should this civilization appear to be doomed, it would be significant to those who value technology to promote global meta-civilization instead. The quick­er EuRoman society overcomes its significant internal distortion, the more likely it is that it will be able to avoid or stave off its \"im­perial\" decadence, or at least ensure that its level of technology is advanced enough to prolong its own Empire much longer than em­pires in the past have done. Similarly, if and when there appears to be a chance for the EuRoman society to continue developing in an un-or less distorted fashion, it is to its advantage if the afore­mentioned meta-civilization never fully develops, since there is no guarantee that competing civilizations will use advanced technol­ogy more wisely or well, and could develop or continue their own distortions on a grander scale as a consequence. Having considered the broad themes of potential conflict, the prospects for changing one's allegiance from one civilization to another should be considered, since the practice of aeonic magic may involve transition across not only political but also civiliza­tional boundaries. Civilizations directly progenated by Universal Churches are the easiest to \"join.\" (A Muslim convert is a member of the Islamic Civilization, even if that person is not affiliated to Arabic culture.) Totally ethnic civilizations are the most difficult to join. (Some interpretations hold that it is next to impossible, if not actually impossible, for gaijin to \"become\" Japanese.) The extent to which a person can join a \"meta-civilization\" depends on how far it has penetrated into their own original civilization. Joining a super-civilization seems to be n Question of loyalty and alle­giance, especially in its emergent state.

It is notoriously difficult to convert to Judaism, and even more difficult to be accepted as a member of the ethnic culture even once religiously converted. It is not, however, impossible by definition, as it might be to \"join\" an ethnic tribe which has not developed a religious form. The reonic role of an ethnic, tribal culture, however, is difficult for religious converts to adopt and promote due to their lack of cultural foundation in its context. The question of Jewish identity and influence is directly rele­vant to the consideration of the Christian pseudomorphosis, its resulting distortion, and its consequence, the revelation of which pertains to the initial inquiry into reonic apocalypse. Philosopher Erich Vcegelin, in the first volume of his Order and Histor]?.'\" ex­amined Israel and its prophetic revelations, considering that the whole Jewish culture has been \"in exodus from civilization.\" One of the reasons that consideration of its influence was absent in the work of Toynbee and Spengler is that they only addressed the significance and impact of peoples they considered to func­tion on the civilizational scale. Due to its ethnic basis in a non­universalist tribal culture which nevertheless spawned a religion with aeonic impact, Judaism has influenced other civilizations and their development, rather than developing its own. It might have, had civilization developed from the Kingdom of the Khazars, in which Judaism was adopted only as a religion, as if Judaism were a \"Universal Church.\" If a pseudomorphic global super-civilization eventually annihilates all other cultures than the ever-resilient Jewish one, perhaps the resulting vacuum could allow the develop­ment of Judaism into a fully fledged civilization of its own. Aside from these possibilities, Judaism is no exception to the general rule that the influences of a foreign culture or civilization on an­other tend to be distortionate either when they are imposed by pseudomorphosis or insinuated for the deliberate benefit of their conveyers.

The idea that such immanenti­zation attempts spring from repeated frustrations of millenarian­ism, in the same way that materialism can result from frustrated transcendental monotheism, appears much more plausible, espe­cially given the millenarian structure of such modern materialist religions as Marxism. Tangentially, the phrase \"immanentize the eschaton\" has been adopted by occultists concerned with aeonics, principally chaos magicians. This suggests an unintended applica­tion of Vregelin's concept: it is the global super-civilization which purports to replace, yet fulfil. the originally Jewish apocalyptic millenarian expectations of EuRoman civilization, which world­wide post modernism promotes. In terms of occult war, Revelation inverts the cultural signifi­cance of the symbolism of Empire and rulership, depicting it as diabolical and Satanic, while presenting destructive influences as salvific. Due to this inversion, Christian Europeans who accept­ed the book were encouraged to diabolize their own society and venerate what undermined it. This has led to considerable rico­cbet, especially in the conspiracist movement, as the imagery of Revelation is frequently re-appropriated for ostensibly European purposes, despite its obvious unsuitability to the task. As such, \"Christians\" as interested in defending their own society as un­dermining it, turn against those who they determine to be Satanic, or agents of the New World Order, or some similar diabolization, when in fact they may have a common purpose. Contrarily, even when those who are enemies of Europe are criticized by European Christians, such Christians will sometimes use the symbolism of Revelation in their attacks, thereby assuring that they are still ac­tually attacking themselves by using distorted imagery already re­sponsible for the pseudomorphosis of the entire civilization. This is related to the tactic of dilution through surrogates; in this case, the \"surrogate Europe\" of \"traditional Christianity.\" Similarly, many attempts to establish new cultural forms, or correct the dis­tortion, have been presented, especially by esoteric visionaries or occultists, through the imagery of the book. Attempts to found the \"New JerusalemH in America, or proclaim the New Aeon of the Beast 666, or the coming of the Christ, Antichrist, Messiah, or all of them (such as the bizarre Christian Satanism of The process Church of the Final Judgment) have generally been vitiated by 116"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"OCCULT WAR FOR THE lEON relying on imagery programmed with eschatological dualism from its creation.

The single tactic of occult war in Evolian terms which Revelation does not exemplify is the tactic of infiltration, since the eschato­logical fanatics and millenarian martyrs promoting it can hardly have been considered agents of Tradition to begin with. Contrarily, it might be considered that the promotion and adoption of the im­agery and style of Revelation even among non-and anti-Christian esoteric and occult groups could be a type of textual or aesthetic infiltration. An esoteric evaluation of similar themes is presented in Donald Tyson's article on The Enochian Apocalppse!9 which ar­gues that the Enochian system of magic is actually intended allow I he demon Coronzon (the Enochian Satan) into our reality -to immanentize the eschaton. As Tyson has since taken the antino­mian Gnostic view of Coronzon/Satan/Lucifer as the liberating serpent and friend to the Gnostic elect,'° this inversion of posi­I ion provides an opportunity to similarly evaluate ways of using a (localyptic imagery in aeonic magic. So far, Revelation has been construed to indicate that even if Satan wins, he loses, since the l:mpire of Antichrist is temporary, and the Messiah wins in the I'nd. Tyson implies that the attempt to immanentize the eschaton m:1 unlly disappoints the moral, transcendentalist, eschatological dualist, by creating a Satanic empire which then fails to die on rue.

Even the imagery of the martyrs can be re-appropriated in this way. Similarly, the counterfe it can itself be counterfeit; thus, for example, someone acting on behalf of EuRoman civilization could falsely present themselves as a Christian, Messianic figure even when this was not the case. This would, ironically, simultane­ously suggest the role of Antichrist. Diabolical, Satanic imagery can itself be inverted in a Nietzschean transvaluation of values. In recent decades, secular Americans have sometimes deliberately identified with \"The Great Satan\" in opposition to radical Islam, for example. Dilution and surrogates can also be reversed; thus, even persons aware of the pseudomorphic and distorted nature of both original and European Christianity, could still prefer its imagery to - continuing the previous example - an Islamic Europe. A subtler method of deflating apocalyptic obsession and escha­tological dualism would be deliberate misidentification of various things, people, and events with apocalyptic imagery, and thereby depotentiating it. These examples demonstrate \"apocalyptic warfare\" as a par­ticular sub-category of the \"occult war for the reon,\" in the sense that the possibility of immanentizing the eschaton, and doing so at a certain time and in a certain context, is a significant factor in the distortion, correction, survival, or destruction, of EuRoman civili­zation as a whole. Similarly, it is relevant wherever the Universal Church of Christianity has influence, and where the Universal Churches of Secular Modernity, such as Marxism-Leninism, have had influence.

I realize that everyone now mocks the UN as a weak inef­fective parody of a world government, and scoffs at those of us silly enough to believe it could be a threat to human liberty. Let me remind you that Joseph Stalin, Adolph Hitler, and Mao Tse Tung were once helpless little babies in their mother's arms.

As it was being rejected by the American Senate, Wilson's close friend and advisor Edward Mandel House and others formed t he Royal Institute of International Affairs in London in 1919, and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York in 1921, to prepare the public for acceptance of international governing bodies. The UN was born in 1945, two and a half decades later. The utopian pipedream outlined in the UN's so-called \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" includes a laundry list of \"rights\" - among which are the \"right\" to paid vacations and the \"right\" to hold opinions. The net effect of this gibberish is to so dilute the meaning of the word \"rights\" that the word \"rights\" becomes meaningless. In addition - and this is the important part - every \"right\" granted by the state under the UN model is capable of being re­moved by the state for \"good\" reason. Therefore, it is not a right, hut a privilege. Article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights identi­lies the exact origin of the rights recognized by the UN. It reads in full, \"Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the com­petent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental right gmnted him by the constitution or by law.\" For more evidence of the conditional nature of statist \"rights,\" IL't '$ look at the wording of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: \"The above-mentioned rights shall not be sub­jcct to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre pub­lic). public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other rights recognized in the present ( :ovcnant.\" Since every \"right\" is granted by the state, and every \"right\" is ('apahle of being removed by the state, what the globalists actually oll'L'r is an assortment of alienable privileges -the conceptual an­tit l1l'sis of unalienable rights.

The meaning of \"unalicnable\" is \"incapable of being alienated, surrendered or t I'llnsfclTcd.\" Also, by identifying the source of our rights as God, the Crcator, Jefferson places rights beyond the reach of some sclf­Importnnt bureaucrat monkeying about with UN cavents.

Only those capable of self-discipline may be free from the need for external tyranny. Without a belief in a Higher Power to whom one is directly and personally responsible, it is debatable whether a person can live as a free man or woman. (One might question how someone who thinks as I do could subscribe to the statement, \"There is no god but man.\" It is possible to understand the term \"man\" as applying to a being far more exalted than a semi-rational featherless biped. Psychology accepts the existence of an unconscious mind. I hold that human beings may access a \"super-conscious\" mind, which I would term \"the beginning of God.\") The alternative to an ethically aware, faith-based political or­der appears to be the globalist, secular model being shoved down our throats at an increasingly breakneck pace. In the collectivist world view, the \"realist\" or \"expert\" has concluded that most peo­ple are not capable of governing themselves. Therefore, our more self-disciplined leaders must fill the vacuum by providing adequate controls for us - their moraL spirituaL and intellectual inferiors. (Not bad work if you can get it.) Tyranny is merely a form of discipline designed to bring about the right ordering of society - in this case by external compulsion. It is not illogical in the least. Amateurs in the New World Order crowd may actually believe they are doing the right thing by at­tempting to manage society. Human beings require discipline for survival. At the most basic and personal leveL without the discipline provided by our bone structure we would collapse.

Furthermore, it is only by combating the current ten­dency towards materialism that man can hope to find harmony within himself and his environment. It is proposed this process of awakening can be instigated through exposure to events, which have the capacity to strike at the very core of one's being. This es­say draws upon the plight of the Ismaili gnostic and demonstrates how, in the midst of his struggle for freedom, the application of esoteric symbolism in the Tower of the tarot trumps and exegesis of Qu r'anic revelation can provide a means of understanding the t rue nature of liberation. Ultimately, however, this essay argues t hat, of the dwindling routes presently open for actualising spir­itual potential, the medium of creativity as art in its divine form, free from the constraints imposed by the rigid infrastructure of society, is a potent weapon in this fight. And, since the degree of separation from divinity has limited man's potential for true creativity, the inevitable conclusion is a return from exile to the absolute point of origin; where creator, creativity and creation are one. Although spiritual warfare is the inescapable condition of ex­istence for the Ismaili gnostic, he understands that all attempts to escape from the arena of worldly pain are in vain and that lib­erty can only won by pervading the physical orders and structures Ilf relationships which exist between individuals, society and na­ture. Similarly, the simultaneous side-stepping of space and time hecomes the modus operandi for his mission, achieved through penetrating the mesocosm of cosmic imagination, which resides hetween the sensible and intelligible realms. The lsmaili gnostic today is one who, moulded by processes of pluralism and an esoteric interpretation of Islam within the West, linds himself in a unique disposition. His motivating forces fo r salvat ion have become synonymous with his Western occult breth­ren with whom he has forged alliances. The goals he sets himself nrc to be free from the slavery of the passions; from the errors of Ignorance, the pains of fear and the anxieties of desire. For the Ismaili gnostic, any apparent conflicts with religious law are of no roncern and he clings firmly to his maxim; eternally affirming that nothing is true and all is permitted. Part and parcel of this mode of existence is the active usc of magic, which he has integrated into everyday existence.

This struggle with the nafs assists in the ultimate realisation that although man is more than skin, flesh and bones, his composition is essentially analogous to that of his creator. ... arm yourselves for hard strife, but have faith in the won­ders of your God!' Before going further let us recapitulate the symbols in the Tower of the tarot trumps as depicted in Tarot de Marseille (Camoin­Jodorowsky) pack. The emblem shows a lofty tower, whose crowned summit is being blasted by a zigzag of lightning. Red tongues of flame from heaven lick the three windows from which two figures, possibly the builders of the tower, are seen falling. These two fig­ures can be interpreted as the destruction of dualism, the by-prod­uct of human logic and binary thought, which has the profoundest ability to create diversions where, in effect, none exist. Another in­terpretation of the Tower makes reference to its original name as the House of God, which in the Middle Ages was also the name for a hospital. The flesh colour of the building indicates the structure may symbolise the human body whilst the lightning flash strik­ing the castellated tower may imply that man's reasoning faculties are being attacked from above. From a Kabbalistic perspective, the tower symbolises the Ruach or empirical ego. As Israel Regardie teaches, it is only through destruction of the 'glamorous bondage' that the light of the Neschamah can illumine the mind. The Tower is assigned to Mars, god of war, or, in Kabbalistic terms, to the divine wrath whose descending lightning is synonymous with the upward Path of the Arrow, the Middle Pillar on the Tree of Life akin to the 'Straight Path' (Siratal Mustaqeem) of the Ismailis. In its essence, the Tower resembles the Tower of Babel struck by the lightning of divine wrath, signifying catastrophe and downfall. It also bears similarities to the symbolism of the Babylonian ziggu­rat, whose base was considered as the navel of the earth and its summit in the sky. It was by climbing the ziggurat that one sym­bolically made the ascent towards heaven.

Although science and philosophy initially limited the degree of separation, the growth in demand for natural resources has put man in a situation where the combined need to survive and a will to power is being used to destroy nature instead. These processes of detachment and deteri­oration, which now torment man in his daily life, cannot go on in­definitely. Humanity has become impatient; seduced by rhetoric, it is eager and willing for change. Surely the day of judgement must be at hand? Ultimately, this realisation dictates resignation to the inevitable conclusion that death cannot be evaded through lifestyle choice or medical advances. And even though man anticipates it to take place in front of his very eyes, as Swedenborg reminds us, the final judgement takes place in the spiritual world, not on Earth. One of the foremost misfortunes of modern man is the miscon­strued concept of truth as the mindless regurgitation of informa­tion and a mistaken sense of transcendence through intellectual va nity. Concern with the external world and its sordid indulgences is hollow for the Ismaili gnostic, but it is through exposure to worldly pain that a process of intimate communication with the di­vine is instigated. This process, which has the capacity to climax in a feedback loop between creator and creation, becomes the mode by which merging with absolute truth becomes possible. Whilst the 1 14"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"ORGY IN MATTER divine employs the use of visible signs in the universe, it is man's potential for creativity, which becomes the means by which he is able to orientate himself on the rope towards the cosmic north via the Straight Path. Ibn 'Arabi, in The Bezels of Wisdom, divides men into two groups; those who travel the way they know and those who travel a way they do not know and of whose destination they are unaware, which is also the straight path. The Ismaili gnostic calls upon God with spiritual perception, whilst he who is not a gnostic calls Him in ignorance and is bound by tradition. In this sense, the path itself is also an illusion for man because in the ab­solute higher sense of his self he is identical with the divine. The goal of the Ismaili gnostic is therefore the total surrender of the self to the transmutation of the soul and its resurrection as part of the journey to its point of origin. This is the true meaning of Islam, not the distorted political fantasies, which the masses ab­sorb through media speculation and propaganda. The attainment of liberty through annihilation of the outer form is necessary in order to behold the fixed and absolute, which lies buried within the lemple of the self. The most wondrous fire for activating change is Ihat which burns inside the heart of the gnostic and his ability to ulilise his anguish as an immensely powerful catalyst for effecting change. In the case of the Tower, it is the destruction of material­ism by fire. Fragmentary approaches to discovering and unveiling Irulh are worthless, only total annihilation of the tower can lead 10 enlightenment . From the perspective of the IsmaiIi gnostic, the inner search takes precedence over any exteriorised form of wor­ship, which is often based on a static literal interpretation of his­lorical and mythical events. This mode of being does not call for I he abandonment of tradition, but concentrates instead on the al­legory and individualised implication of practice, which both pre­dull'S and encompasses the basis of all religions. In this sense, the ISlllaili gnostic stands outside time and can therefore be subsumed wilhin any outward fo rm, free from detection (taqil'l'ah). II Illllst be made clear however, that this process of breaking down Ihe illusory veils, which have sheltered and sheathed man \"Inre his fall into matter, has to operate without interference from Ihl' inlellect. Awakening does not come through contemplation of IIrdi nllry knowledge. Instead it is mystical knowledge, which leads III gnosis (ma'rifat). Furthermore, this is precisely how man's con­It'lIIporary vision of apocalypse, viewed in Ihe conlcxl of revcla­lion, hecomes the vehicle, which leads him towards his salvat ion. I I'>"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"XVI With this in mind we can turn to the role of the Qur'an, in par­ticular Sura 13 (Raa, meaning thunder), which deals specifically with revelation. As in the symbols of the Tower, revelation also leads the awakened searcher to truth via the allegorical and eso­teric interpretation of external signs, which are visible in nature. In this Sura, it is written how the heavens were raised without pillars, leading the initiate to realise the futility of the mate­rial world, symbolised in the present context of the Tower. It is Allah, who punishes and rewards both those who have forgotten and equally those who have take it upon themselves to change. Punishment becomes synonymous with the means of accepting grace for the Ismaili gnostic through the power of the lightning flash, which strikes by way of both hope and fe ar. As this proc­ess is indiscriminate, the heavenly thunderbolts hold the capacity to strike across the whole of humanity at the mercy of His will alone. Transcendence becomes possible through Him, becoming One with the One leads to liberation. However, a fundamental paradox remains: Is divine grace ordained only upon those who have taken it upon themselves to change and awaken from the slumber of their ignorance? If so, is it only through His Majesty that the Ismaili gnostic's fire can be ignited, shattering the tower of the human organism and submitting to the power of the in­finite? In the Book of Enocb, lightning becomes the visual aid by which divine judgement is witnessed on earth. The accompanying thunder is the process by which these judgements are actualised into reality, emanating from the mouth (or myth) and erected as the tower. In Sufism, this brings to mind the technique known as dbikr, meaning remembrance or invocation. By calling the Divine into actuality through a process akin to erecting the Tower, man gives rise to the possibility for the simultaneous fertilisation of his own creation in a bid to become one with his creator. Henry Corbin explains how the active or creative imagination is essentially the same as the organ of theophanies, because it is the organ of creation and because creation is essentially theophany. In this respect, the imagination is greater than the power of thought, which seeks to divide where no divisions exist. For the Ismaili gnostic, it is when the higher self knows Him, that the self can contemplate Him. And by knowing Him, the true self of the T in turn causes lIim to exist. 1)6"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"XVI I am tbe Trutb! I am tbe Trutb! we bear tbe God-drunk gnostic crl? The microcosm abides in ME; Eternal Allab's nougbt but IP The Islamic mystics teach that the platform for this creative exchange is found within the true or higher self. and that God is accessible through the creative or cosmic imagination. Fundamentally, this encounter doesn't take place outside the creator-creature totality. The process itself can be explained as a hermeneutic of symbols, involving the transmutation of sensory data and rational concepts into symbols e.g. the visual process of the lightning striking the tower of the illusory self. causing the liberation of spirit into di­mensions outside of time and space. Furthermore, it is the process of the magical act, carried out by conception of a lightning flash, in which the mental power fixes the command of the goal. It is proposed that the role of the magician (as artist) is to use these symbols to break the barrier down between himself and cre­ator, activating the creative principle from within whilst channel­ling inspiration from the realm of cosmic imagination. Whether the artist draws down influence or creates it as a result of actualis­ing the creative principle from within is presently unimportant. What is crucial however, is that this process undoubtedly equates to the true mode and role of art; that which acts as a channel for cosmic influence. Furthermore, this realisation supports the idea of man as a living god and true reflection of the universe as the microcosm. In this context we see the role of human beings as liv­ing poems with the ability to become poets, simultaneously driv­ing and participating in existence in accordance with their own divine right. To assist modern man in overcoming his present in­ertia from spiritual evolution, art must turn towards the cosmic channel of influence and draw power from the mundus imaginalis (,alam al-mitbal). This is believed to be one of the primary means by which man will be able to facilitate the surge towards a new creative order, combating the current state of fragmentation i n the world. As David Bohm confirms, this strategy requires an extreme and sensitive perception of the orders and structures of relation­ships between individuals, society and nature.

On occasions this would extend into simply dozens of spreads, as each question an­swered prompted more questions, leading to a fractured, fractal expansion of queries - which is a good way to learn the cards, even if it's only how to shuffle them fluently. Early one spring morning in the 1980s I performed a reading for, and before, a long and sig­nificant actual and metaphorical journey ahead, the physical part of it being a drive of around one hundred and sixty miles to meet and study with my then magical teacher for six days - a hothouse week, if you wish. I then performed several other readings in an attempt to divine precisely what the teaching events of the week would produce, as I had been primed about how there was to be a fo rmal initiatory experience involved. The spread for the journey itself centred around the Tower. Perhaps distracted by the (in-parts confusing, but hugely promis­ing) meanings of the cards which were then unveiled for the 'initi­ation' part of the week, I did not at that point fully apprehend nor appreciate the many and varied impacts of this card, The Blasted Tower as it is called in some historically older decks, and the cen­tral position in which it emerged in the spread in relation to the jou rney itself. Sixteen minutes into my journey, on a busy motorway right next to a HUGE telecommunications tower, I burst a front tyre in the outside lane at top speed, completely lost control of the car, pirou­etted several times while moving across three lanes of traffic in a lurching, juddering and sickening gyroscopic fashion and I came to rest facing the opposite direction as I sprayed gravel onto the hard shoulder of the motorway. I was uninjured and had injured no one else, and had hit nothing in the process but my wheels had drawn a swirling, Michael Bertiaux-esque manic sorcerous sigil in still-smoking black rubber across perhaps a hundred yards of the tarmac behind me. Somehow I had (just) retained bowel control but I was utterly terrified by the experience. But what a perfect initiatory jolt! Several trembling cigarettes, and a lot of deep breathing later, the wheel (eight spokes) was suc­cessfully changed and I resumed my journey, considerably more chastened and thoughtful.

As a symbol it's easy - the Tower including as it does the astrological symbol of Taurus, and the sacrificial nail from the crucifixion of the Osiris wannabee (Jesus H Christ). The Tower is Shiva, feared and fear­ful destroyer of worlds, and for anyone who is a scientist, then sixteen is the atomic number of sulphur, what better a demonic element for this theme!

Church towers in France in wartime 1944 were used as spotter hides and for somewhere ideal for snipers to lurk. and the Allied forces' rules of engagement were not to shoot at the towers with artillery, in a creditable, if rather old-fashioned in war, at­tempt to leave at least some of the French architecture and culture standing when they had finished. However there were many times when shelling of church towers was done to reduce the loss of life in advancing troops. See and be seen, that is the problem with the Tower - while it is a truly great and useful vantage point there is also vulnerability - and when in 'Tower' mode in magical work there is also this cleft stick problem. I recall at a time of great, intense and prolonged practical magi­cal activity in a home temple, I was introduced to a local magician who I had slightly heard of, but not previously met. We were in­troduced at a social gathering and he cheerfully said to me as an opening sentence, 'Ah, you live in XXXX (name of area and street in a nearby large and fairly anonymous town) don't you?' Somewhat surprised (since I was certain we had no common acquaintance who remotely knew where I lived, and this was long before the days when you could simply google someone and supposedly find out all about them) I agreed, and asked how he knew. 'Well, the huge purple-flamed strobe-flashing astral pentagram spinning out of your roof about 500 feet into the air is a clue!', he laughed, 'and you are carrying that same purple light with you now'. Purple light is Octarine, which brings us back to eight and thus sixteen again. We subsequently became friendly, and I later suggested a ritual method by which he could euthanise a terminally ill and medically vegetative relative using magical means to end their suffering, but that's another story, possibly for a book on magical ethics one day. The Tower is something to be avoided, but only by those who are avoidant of transforming themselves and those who wish to elude facing powerful events, thus dooming themselves to eternal stagnation.

The Tower is the world tree, the axle, the pivot around which the universe moves, it is the conductor's baton, leading and directing the cosmic harmony in the symphony of destruction and regeneration, a series of sounds embodied in the most apocalyptic classical music to be found on the planet, of which the excesses of Wagner are but a tame and tempting prel­ude, and the bassline is the dreadful throbbing of the machinery of war and genocide, as the mouth of death opens and closes in time to the beat. THERE ARE NO BAD OR GOOD CARDS in the tarot, it is all merely a well-polished mirror. The Tower is neither a threat, nor a chal­lenge, it is a signpost of things to come, and I welcome it appearing in spreads performed for myself. It says to me, embrace tbe Tower, embrace cbange - face J?our fears, sbatter illusions and see tbe world as it reallJ? is. There is an element of horrifying realisation evoked by the card, which is why Some will certainly fear the Tower; but on a psychic level it is more akin to an optician performing an eye test, and if required, one can then gain a new set of lenses with which to view the world in much more accurate and clearer detail afterwards. So, the Tower symbolises the breakdown of rules, and the im­position of new roles. It is also an absence of order, pure and beautiful swirling chaos! Yet even uttermost chaos swirls around something ... and that something is the Tower, the Axis Mundi, the thorn tree whose roots are so deep in the Earth that no excava­tion can reach their ends, and whose branches scrape the furthest reaches of the universe.

The magical ego crumples. If you arc honest with yourself, it crumples. What is left is the fragile ex­posed core, and that's the component of oneself that needs to find its power as a magician. I couldn't go on playing these smug and self-satisfied games and calling it magic. If there was any point 01' purpose to persisting with the occult, I had to find something that addressed itself to the life or death challenges presented by the in­l'I'easingly hostile world that I appeared to have been tipped into. To some degree, the events of 11th September served as a catalyst fo r my drift away from chaos magic and towards a Vo odoo-based practice. The magic I was doing at the time just seemed woefully inadequate to the circumstances that I felt might be up ahead. I didn't feel well-equipped with what I had in the bag of tricks, and I was determined to address these shortcomings while there was slill time to do so. Vo odoo is all about survival. It has stood resil­il'nt to the depravities of western slavery, endured concentrated I'lI'nrts to kill its people and crush its spirit, and has been persist­I'ntly demonised and belittled for centuries. But it doesn't die. It �I ill stands tall.

It seemed to me that magic had become something of a hobby in the West, a dilettante pursuit for those with the leisure time and resources for advanced navel-gazing. In many circles, the purpose of occultism seemed to be a competition to see who could drive themselves horribly insane in the most elaborate man­ner, and then write about it at length - preferably in a hardback limited edition collector's grimoire filled with incomprehensible jargon. I'm not sure when our culture's conception of magic be­came so diminished, but there was an obvious dissonance between the dubious career path of the modern occultist, and the role of magician (or shaman, or witchdoctor, or houngan) as it appeared in accounts of our prehistory, and as it still appears in the various indigenous cultures that have sustained a place for magic in their model of reality. I wanted to get back to something like that, and the obvious place to start looking was within a culture that has maintained this role into the present, and which relies upon it being filled by an individual competent enough to address their magic to real world concerns on a daily basis. I felt as if I was preparing for something. I kept getting per­sistent and disturbingly prescient flashes of a potential future where these skills would be needed. It gnawed at me. I didn't like what I saw in the visions. My city was devastated and suffering. I couldn't tell what had happened exactly, but I was older, getting about on a stick because of some accident . Bombed-out buildings, troubled streets. I'd escaped some sort of draft because of an in­jury and that's the only reason why I was still alive. There weren't that many people around, disparate groups trying to carry on as norma\\, but it was bad. Resources were limited and dwindling, the streets were dangerous, everything had gone down the pan.

However, as much as I tried to brush it off, the visions wouldn't let up. I kept on drifting back to this narrative in unguarded moments, and I couldn't seem to shake this deep-rooted sense of foreboding about the future. I carried this nagging apprehension around with me for some years, before I became astute enough in interpreting visionary experience to understand that a literal interpretation -whilst sometimes valid -does not always bear the most significant fruit. When you dissect this material. it is important to understand that you are dealing with the language of dreams, and what is be­ing communicated is not always the surface play of images but the emotional content . What was there, was the heart of magic. When you strip away the superficial post-apocalyptic action movie elements of that nar­rative, it is about magic administering to need. In these dark cir­cumstances, there was magic. It got out on the streets, regardless of its own injuries, and brought the spell where it needed to be. It didn't matter how hopeless the bigger picture might have looked, or what the odds were or how much had been lost - the magician in that vision was on the ground trying to make a difference. The lamp was trimmed and burning. The doctor was in. Looking at it in this way suggested something to me about the role of magic. However fucked it is, you find a way. When the whole world is ensnared in a web of horrors, and stories of doubt and despair swoop about like predatory beasts, the job of a ma­gician is to imagine something different. Armed with fierce old stories, passed on from the ancestors, the sorcerer must tell a tale t hat is stronger than the narratives of fear and hopelessness thnt compete for dominance. The value of a magician is their ability to craft a healthy narrative that sinks in deep and conjures new worlds and new possibilities into fruition. My fu ture post-apocn­Iyptic sorcerer self was going door-to-door, taking care of practical things, black market medicine here and rootwork there, but all of that activity emerged from somewhere within. What he was really doing was casting a healthy spell in a sick world, a nd doing eve­rything in his powe r to make that take root. He could have just as cn�ily have been a stone age shaman, weaving similar narratives of survival fo r the tribe. You don't need an apocalypse scenario to do that job.

We're not quite in that terrible mess just yet, and there is still time and po­. tential to turn things around, but the job remains the same. You get up and do it, regardless of what is going on outside. Arriving at that position seemed to dispel any lingering fears about an up­coming apocalypse. Whatever the situation, the lamp remains lit. Certainly that grim future I perceived was a possibility on the ta­ble, but this waking moment is filled with potential and there is much that can be done in the here and now. You adapt your magic to the circumstances of time and place. The thing about prescient glimpses of possible futures is that they haven't happened yet, and the conditions for their fruition are often wholly dependent on fa ctors that are currently in motion. I began to examine more closely the ways in which I might be complicit in the conjuration of that potential grim future. What was I doing to hasten that trajectory? What was I not doing to slow or prevent such a course? Is that genuinely the only timeline ahead of us? Are there any alternative tracks that we could get on? What other possible futures might be conjured out of the raw material of the present? I became acutely aware of how I was, on a personal level, actively colluding with the driving factors of that dystopia. I had bought into the pornography of doom that saturated the cul­ture and its media, and by giving worth and value to this masochis­tic na rrative, I was effectively feeding and nourishing its bulging roots. Clearly the focus of my own attention was just a tiny fuel cell contributing towards its growth, but I was contributing to it, and I could stop. It was within my ability to withdraw my patronage of this complex of ideas, and place it somewhere else. The apocalypse is a scam. It lures you in to its frame of reference and takes you out of the embodied moment. As soon as you begin to buy into the inevitability of an apocalypse narrative, you equally begin to step away from the living potentiality of the crossroads .md give up a portion of your own power and agency. It sucks you in, assigns you a pair of boots. and sets you to work in its service.

Loudest are the Christian fundamentalist belief in The Rapture, and the coun­ter cultural yearning for a trans formative event to occur in the year 2012. I see them roughly as two sides to the same coin. They both hanker for a future where our present status quo is turned on its head, and replaced with a version of reality that conforms to the prejudices of the believer. In both visions, those that adhere to conflicting ideologies tend to be disappeared KGB-style by a mus­cular Jesus or by a heavy squad of grey aliens or something. Both visions have a significant industry built up around them, and are fed and sustained by individuals that have managed to carve out a living by servicing these myths, putting out a series of books or nVDs to further the meme by which they financially profit. The notion of 2012 is particularly insidious, not least in the way that its validity is taken onboard by so many occultists (who should know better) with little critical intervening thought. One of the primary sources for the significance of the year 2012 are I he ideas of the ethnobotanist Terrence Mckenna, specifically his Timewave Zero graph, which attempts to correlate the I Ching wilh the Mayan calendar in order to create a schema where vari­ous world events are predicted on a line graph which culminates 1111 21\" December 2012. McKenna's ideas are problematised by the fact that the Mayan calendar doesn't necessarily predict the end of anything in 2012, its construction is more like a clock that gets around to 12 and then resets itself to zero to begin again. To t he ancient Mayans, 2012 was an impossibly far-off date in the future, and it is difficult to do more than loosely speculate about what it Illay or Illay not have meant to that particular culture. McKenna's Ti Illewave Zero graph has also received criticism for being extreme­ly subjective, in the way it arbitrarily cherrypicks events from a Pl1l't icularly western-skewed reading of world history and assigns I hem 10 points on the graph, thus \"predicting\" various things that have already happened in accordance with its preconceptions.

A lot of occultists, es­pecially, seem to have a hard-on for the end of the world. The idea that one's subjective magical work, performed in a Hackney bed­sit after the pubs have shut, could be a pivotal behind-the-scenes nexus for events of global magnitude is often irresistible to many involved in magic. When you indulge in an eschatonic narrative, it is like a panacea for feelings of insignificance and powerlessness in an uncertain world. It introduces a sense of certainty and sim­plifies the randomness and complexity of world events to an easily digestible plot line. It's oddly more comforting to believe that the Illuminati or the New World Order are behind the scenes orches­trating the trajectory of world events towards some mysterious agenda, than it is to accept that nobody is really in the driving seat and shit just happens. If one's underlying beliefs function as a spur for concrete action towards a constructive goal. then little criticism can be leveled at your preferred working model. provided the fruits of that nar­rative are sound. But all too often, an eschatonic narrative is a license for complacency. The year 2012 is just around the corner, and we will all be booted up into a higher state of consciousness, so I don't really have to do anything. The black helicoptors of the NWO are about to enforce martial law all over the planet, and no­body can stop it, so I don't have to do anything. Jesus and pals are going to magic us up to Heaven any day now, so I don't have to do anything. The details change from eschaton to eschaton, but there is a persistent theme of powerless and inevitability. One's indi­vidual will and personal agency are sublimated to the demands of a supernatural being, or a powerful conspiracy or an aeonic pro­gression, as is one's responsibility to create transformative change at a personal level. The notion of rolling up your sleeves and get­ting to grips with the often decidedly unglamourous daily slog of working for a better future is substituted for an appealing fiction. The individual could not conceivably make a difference in the fa ce of such cosmic churning aeonic tides, so there is no longer much compulsion to consider oneself responsible for what is collectively dreamed into being; and into this va cuum of meaning is poured a comforting sensation of privileged knowledge. Everything is pre­ordained and nothing you do really matters, but it's OK because you are one of the chosen, or have uncovered the conspiracy, or understand the mysteries of the aeon, or are imminently llbout to be bellmed up by llliens, or llngels or llscended dolphin masters or something.

Some of us might perform a song and dance that suggests otherwise, but deep down we are pain­fully aware of our shortcomings as a species. It is at least theoreti­cally within our means to live sustainably and in balance with all other species on the planet, functioning as stewards of nature, but instead we have shaped the environment into something increas­ingly toxic to our continued survival and that of many other forms of life.

This mess is part of our inheritance, and our lives feel like a tiny window onto the problem. We are aware of our responsibility - as living flesh and blood - to correct these imbalances and bequeath a better legacy to future generations, but we feel powerless in the race of insurmountable opposition.

It's easy to scoff, but when you observe the competing eschatonic narratives of our present age, it would seem that our culture as a whole is equally incapable of learning these lessons of history. There is always an apocalypse just around the corner, but it never quite gets here. However, that said, it is increasingly diffi­cult to look at the current global situation and deny that there is a certain momentum to current events. Whilst apocalyptic thinking is nothing new, no previous generation has been quite so spoiled for choice in its possible manifestation. We live in interesting times indeed. Leaving aside potential nuclear, chemical. biological or even supernatural doomsday scenarios - the combination of catastrophic climate change and peak oil could well do the trick, if left unchecked. On our current trajectory, it does seem more than likely that we are headed for - if not an actual apocalypse - then certainly a difficult adaptive change to a more hostile and less hos­pitable planet. The collective will does not currently seem to be there to change course, and denial is largely the default setting for most people. Despite my resistance to self-defeating narratives of apocalypse, I can still read the writing on the wall. A sorcerer pays close attention to signs and portents arising out of synchronicity and the ebb and flow of life. Nine dead crows at the crossroads is rarely an optimistic omen.

The tarot can be quite porten­tous at times, when it drops ideas such as this onto you, but all of life is there in its dance. The worst thing you can do is get paranoid about the occurrence of a difficult card in a reading. The oracle is trying to show you something, not just gloating. The Tower always points to a situation already in a very advanced stage of its natu­ral life cycle, something that has been built beyond its sustainable limits to the point where there can be no forward motion while it stands in its current form. When it comes up in a reading, you gen­erally know fine well what it refers to. It can be a shock, and it is constructed to be a shock, but its power to disturb is exclusively in its confirmation of something that you already know but have so far been unprepared to admit. When you witness the universe deal out the image of that card as physically and viscerally to western culture as it did on September 11th 2001, many of the same admoni­tions apply to its interpretation. In her New Orleans Voodoo Tarot Deck, published in 1992, Mambo Sally Ann Glassman renamed the Tower card as the Deluge, and depicted a breaking levee causing flood waters to sweep away a car, a house and a road. As an illustration composed by a priest­ess of a city built below sea level and surrounded by water, it is an obviously resonant local image of the process of Atu XVI in motion, but her painting does now seem alarmingly prophetic following the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The horrors that befell New Orleans, and the shameful neglect of its survivors by the then-incumbent Republican government, is another heavily symbolic image that is now indelibly imprinted upon the US psy­che, and by extension, that of the western world. During the 2008 US election, it was frequently suggested that the visible misman­agement of Katrina's devastation by George W Bush -along with the US-led global economic meltdown - was one of the key drivers that swept the GOP out of the White House.

At the time of writing, an estimated 200 000 people have died in Haiti following a devastating 7.0 earthquake that struck the be­leaguered nation on 12th January 2010. It is anticipated that many more will suffer and die as a result of the current appalling condi­tions and shambolic efforts to get aid where it is needed. Every day seems to bring worse headlines. The events of September 11th and the impact of Hurricane Katrina are dwarfed in comparison to such a horrific death toll, as they were by the casualties of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. If we are in the business of in­terpretation, what paltry messages can we read into tragedy on this scale? The televangelist Pat Robertson made news headlines shortly after the earthquake struck by asserting that the people of Haiti had struck a deal with Satan to overthrow French rule in 1791, implying that the earthquake was God's delayed reaction punishment for their alleged infernal dalliance. What he was pre­sumably alluding to was the Haitian folk tale of Bois Caiman, in which a Vo dou priest called Dutty Boukman conducted a ceremony for the Lwa on the eve of the Haitian revolution. According to the tale, a pig was sacrificed to Erzulie Dantor, the fierce protective mother of Haitian Vodou, and prayers were made to the ancestral African powers to help the people overcome the rule of the island's brutal slave owners. It worked. The Haitian people accomplished the only successful slave revolution in history and established the first post-colonial black-led republic in the Caribbean. The act of Haiti freeing it­self is often downplayed in its role as a driver of the abolition of slavery, but it sent shockwaves among colonial slave holders and slaveholding countries. If this could happen in Haiti, it could hap­pen literally anywhere next, and where might a chain of events such as this lead? If the reasoned argu ment of Wi lliam Wilberforce was a well-meaning carrot, the recent vivid memory of Haiti was a bloo d-stained stick.

Of course, if your idea of the devil is a force that overthrows slavery and the unjust treatment of your fellow man, it does raise a ques­tion about which god it is you actually serve. In order to keep the example of Haiti contained, the West made concerted efforts to undermine the emergent nation that had so audaciously challenged its global hegemony. No other country in the world even recognised Haiti as a valid nation for the first 30 years of its existence, until a treaty with France was finally signed in 1825 that acknowledged its independence in return for the pay­ment of crippling war reparations. France demanded 150 million francs from Haiti, an amount equivalent to tens of billions today, in order to remunerate former slave owners for the loss of rev­enue caused by the island's freedom. The imposed debt was re­duced to 60 million francs in 1838, but it took 120 years before the debt and interest was eventually cleared in 1947. Already ravaged by war and its agriculture devastated, the payments bankrupted the Haitian treasury and permanently effected the island's ability to prosper. During the recent media coverage of the earthquake, Haiti has frequently been described as a \"failed nation\", but did it ever have much of a chance to be otherwise? The strength of the earthquake that struck Haiti was not an anomaly in size. The planet sees an average of 18 earthquakes of that magnitude each year. The depth of the disaster was exacer­bated to such a degree due to Haiti's vulnerability as the poorest country in the western hemisphere, and even the most cursory study of the nation's history points to the underlying causes of how it came to be in that predicament. Everything has its roots and nothing happens in a vacuum. The desire to pin the blame on Vodou is a game of denial, where the uncomfortable facts of the situation are substituted for a more palatable conspiracy the­ory that absolves complicity. Similarly, in New Orleans following Ilurricane Katrina, several gaping mouths piped up to interpret the natural disaster as a judgement upon or result of the city's fn mous traditions of Voodoo, but the fa cts are far uglier and more prosnic.

Haiti itself has suffered badly from hurricanes in recent years due to similar unrestrained deforestation that has reduced the is­land's woodland to 3 percent of its majestic former presence, leav­ing the towns and villages dangerously exposed to the elements. If you wish to view any of these natural disasters as symbolic por­tents of an upcoming apocalypse, then it pays to look at the histor­ic background and real world cause and effect, because imagina­tive occult conspiracy theories are unhelpful when the basic truth of a situation is so vital to understand and respond to. The Tower can refer to a crumbling ideology, belief system or way of being, as easily as it can refer to a business or government or physical struc­ture.

The suffering and loss of life was caused by falling masonry and lack of medicine, but the contemporary circumstance has its roots squarely in the repercussions of the transatlantic slave trade.

The Tower is always being struck by lightning, as the Sun is always shining and the Fool is always stepping off a precipice into the unknown. If there is a reason why we continually take on board an eschatonic narrative, generation after generation, it is because the experience represented by the Tower is a fundamental condi­tion of our being. It is present in the microcosm and macrocosm of our lives and we confront it on a daily basis. If something re­sembling it can be identified in the terrorist atrocities and natural disasters that befall the world, it can equally be identified at play in our internal world, as previous ways of being can be built to a point where they are unsustainable, and must be pulled down to ensure further healthy movement.

In the language of Rastafari, Babylon is the corrupt and oppressive force that stands in opposition to the Divine way of things, a condition itself synonymous with a mythic Africa or Zion. The Kingdom of Shango was never conquered by the Black Iron Prison. Babylon is temporal power. Police in riot gear beat­ing a news agent to death outside the Bank of England. It is all that which imprisons and oppresses for the benefit of the few, and its myriad prisons may be gross or they may be subtle. Our Lady remains present in Babylon, as all the places of the world are right­fully hers, but there she is called a harlot, spat upon and degraded. Her mystery is not served and her beauty is not accepted. She is thrown out of her temple and forced to sell her pussy to survive in the night. Her once grand boudoirs and bedchambers are reduced to the stained mattresses of the Seven Sisters Road. The magnifi­cence of nature in all her beauty is coldly dissected on a table as notes are made in ball point pen and a report is filed. The pulse of life is bricked up and enclosed behind concrete with only a single window through which to peer out into the meadows and copses below.

The Devil follows Temperance, and is the inevitable upset of that equilibrium. When its energetic force builds itself to a point where it believes it can imprison and enslave nature itself within a tower of its own construction, the Axe of Shango falls from the sky and brings it to the ground. The Tower is split asun­der in a flash of lightning. There will always be another Tower, as the Wheel of Fortune keeps turning, but for now there is One Star in Sight. The debris of our past mistakes are all about us. Nothing but bricks, broken bottles and sticks. If we look up from this wasteland of shattered form, we witness the unveiling of the company of heaven. It is a failing for a magician to fetishise and obsess over one condition of being, dwelling upon the cracked walls and crumbling masonry, caught up in an endless slow motion fall to earth from a blasted turret. All mysteries must be placed in their proper context if they are to be understood. If Temperance loses its balance to create a Devil; and that Devil builds a corrupt Tower of Babel that inevita­bly must fall; the next card in the tarot sequence, the Star, is the guiding light that remains when the dust has settled. Z'etoile is a symbol of our highest aspirations. It leads us through the arid desert to the birth of the Divine within matter. One in a taxi and two in a car. Herod and all Babylon in wicked pursuit. Police and thieves in the street. Nestled among the beasts, with cow and piglet for nursemaids, chicken and donkey for midwives, and all of creation for a kingdom, new possibility opens its eyes and takes its first breath of awareness. A tiny glimmer of light be­gins to flicker in the darkness of winter. It is the ancient role of the Magi to follow the Star to this point of first becoming and admin­ister to the holy infant while it is vulnerable and the possibility it represents is still nascent. It is an error to fetishise this tale and re­duce such a process of existence to a single historic event or to the birth of a specific real life personage, just as it is an error to limit the mysteries of the Tower to the events of September 11th or any other physical iteration of its pattern. All of these matters allude to conditions of being, and their contemplation should open doors to understanding, not consign one to a cul-de-sac of fatalism. One of the first things you hear in the career of magic is that Ever]? man and woman is a Star, which is a lovely thought, but diffi­cult to keep in mind when the gravity of matter weighs you down, and life is a daily scrabble to put food on your table and keep a roof over your head.

The eso­teric image of the Star suggests further occult concepts such as the knowledge and conversation of one's Holy Guardian Angel; or the process of discovering one's True Will and accomplishing it. These ideas are often mystified, and understood at several steps removed from one's basic day-to-day human experience. It is a tendency of many magicians to try and wall magic off in a Tower of its own, without paying due attention to the axiom as above, so below. The Magician in the tarot is making this symbol with his hands. It couldn't be more obvious, but still it is missed. The choices we make in life, what we permit within our im­mediate orbit, and how we choose to live should be the crux of a practice; but are often sidelined as mundane affairs inconsequen­tial to the peak experiences of a spiritual life. The idea of discover­ing one's True Will is frequently misappropriated and described in terms of a somewhat fascistic will to power, but for me it is simply about healthy growth according to one's true nature. Knowledge and Conversation of one's Holy Guardian Angel sounds like some­thing that might occur with a great fanfare, flashing lights and dramatic ceremony -but I see it as more of a growing awareness of and dialogue with the truth of ourselves and the core of our be­ing that can subtly emerge from a committed practice. Certainly there are programmes of work designed to stimulate this experi­ence, such as the Abramelin operation and its derivatives, but I'm not sure how helpful it is to frame such a process as a single event, though this is the way it is often pitched. Aleister Crowley claimed to have finally attained knowledge and conversation of his HGA when he was halfway up a mountain, after various failed ceremo­nial efforts, which suggests his own understanding of the process contained considerable flexibility. If there is a single biggest pitfall of magic, it is perhaps deciding that one has become enlightened or has attained to some elevated or higher state of being fo llowing a peak experience, because peak experiences are ten-a-penny in magic. What matters is how you relate the fruits of that peak experience to the nitty gritty of your everyday life, and you stand or fall as a magician based on your propensity to do this. The phrasing knowledge and conversation, to my mind, describes an ongoinr, process of diillogue, not one unique event, and it's what you do every day that matters.

In Vodou, it is believed that each of us has a Mete Tete, or master of the head or patron Saint. It is a concept similar to the western idea of a Holy Guardian Angel. The spirit of your head is the Lwa whose mysteries most closely express your innermost nature, and the daily knowledge and conversation of this power enables you to best fulfill your full promise and potential in the world. Developing a healthy relationship with your patron Saint is equally an introspection into your own true nature; and the closer you come to your Saint, the more you act in accordance with the core of your being. The parallels with the Western magic concept of contacting your HGA and the Thelemic idea of accomplishing your True Will should be immediately apparent. All of these ideas appear to express something of the mystery of the Star from the Tarot. It is that process of witnessing the glimmer in the night, and following where it leads. The Star is a condition of being, and akin to the Tower, it manifests in both the macrocosm of global events and in the microcosm of our day-to­day experience. When shadows and doubt, fear and uncertainty. press in from all sides, Z'etoile is that which endures. A pinprick of hope in the night. Distant, but bright. Inextinguishable. The lamp which burns without oil. The spark of potential that led fish out of the waters onto dry land, and caused great apes to strive towards the mysteries of fire and language and toolmaking. It burns still. and contains within its furnace a blueprint for a better future than the one that would have us scrabbling to survive in a blighted post­apocalyptic wasteland. Just as you feed and nourish the poisonous roots of that grim future by gleefully investing in the pornography of doom and its eschatonic freefall, so do you contribute to an alternative vision by seeking the Star and following where it leads.

When you take that sort of vision on board, even as a metaphor, the problem factor at work seems to be our species' refusal or inability to apprehend this sort of macro­understanding of our place in nature, which leads us to act from various faulty hypotheses and endanger the habitat that sustains our survival and that of other species of life with which we share the planet. Nobody likes to admit to an error, or accept that their Tower has been poorly constructed, so the building work contin­ues until something in its unsound structure finally gives. We lack the courage to admit failing or ignorance, and instead take on the trappings of an old man stumbling towards the end times; as such a self-image is more gratifying to an inflated planetary ego than the humble admission that we could well be more like a child stum­bling over its first steps. If you eradicate the validity of magic from a culture - belittling its hidden processes as delusion and bunkum, misinterpreting its surface form, and failing to accurately understand what you are observing - you equally eradicate our species' primary means for opening such a dialogue with nature. Without the language of magic, we are limited in our ability to viscerally and emotion­ally fathom these matters, and fall prey to ideologies that permit ecological destruction and mistreatment of life itself. Magic is narrative, and narrative shapes action. When a culture embraces the pernicious narrative that other forms of life are inanimate commodities to be exploited, the door is opened to contemporary atrocities as varied as soaring C02 levels and the horrific impact of the transatlantic slave trade that has directly shaped the current predicament in Haiti. Narrative is also the tool required to dig ourselves out of this hole. Ve nturing into magic and encountering this sort of vision is the easy bit. Whatever the depth and validity of these experiences, they are flatly pointless, solipsistic and self-indulgent if no action is taken as a result. Yet faced with the scale of the seemingly in­surmountable problems that press in on all sides, and the mess of conflicting ideologies that restrict forward progress, what can a single human being hope to accomplish?

The decisions we make every day, how we choose to live, all that we conjure into being, what we are prepared to accept, and what we refuse to ac­cept. This is the heart of magic. The mystery of the Star suggests a perspective beyond the narrow scope of a single human lifetime. If we accept the vision of a tree of being, with its roots in our ancestors reaching back to the primordial beginnings of life, we must embrace this bigger picture. What we do now impacts on the future, and any work we put in today is not for our own ben­efit, but for the benefit of the entire growing organism that is life on Earth. Just as we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors, our every action today conditions the support and foundation we will provide to future generations. The Star provokes utopian visions of our species fulfilling its potential. overcoming the challenges and obstacles in its path, and attaining equilibrium and perfect growth. Yet none of this is going to happen overnight, in our life­times, or in that of our immediate descendants. We're conditioned by our culture to expect instant gratification from our actions, but that's not how nature works. The Star is not a single event or se­ries of events, and there is no end point when the work is done. It is an ongoing process of becoming that manifests in pivotal global events, from the abolition of slavery to our first fumbling out into the solar system; just as it is present every time we make a choice to live better, and do better by those around us and by the planet.

Could it be that such portents of doom are actu­ally distracting us from a more subtle and less entertaining threat? It is the present author's view that these models are not abso­lute. Rather, they embody modes of processing and contextualizing in an attempt to coalesce chaos into a manageable form. This is not to dismiss a seemingly patterned progression of Ages and Times with their own dominant characteristics. The Aeonic schema of Aleister Crowley, for example, is particularly compel­ling in this regard, indicating an orderly pattern of unfolding in human consciousness and culture. There are several vital points in Crowley's work which make his approach not only relevant to the immediate concerns of the present age, but to a larger and trans­historic viewpoint as well. He addresses both the Zeitgeist and the power within human beings to utilize their temporal conditions and rise above them. Time and Eternity are not a dichotomy in Crowley's vision but are as if two lovers, held apart by ignorance and yearning to conjoin. The falcon cannot hear the falconer. The child has broken from the parent's grasp and the Old Aeon of control is crumbling, cata­strophically. Shall we lament this sorry state? In times past, death and dissolution were cause for sackcloth and ashes. In Crowley's \"new religion\" of Thelema, the mourning has been replaced by the \"Greater Feast.\" What is seen by some as death or fearful finality is now being viewed as a vital expression of life whose nature is perpetual change. Yeats felt an impending sense of doom rising with the modern age and expressed it well in his poem.

Yeats had met the young Englishman when both were members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Unimpressed with Crowley's theatrics and bid for authority, his words regarding the young magician were few and dismissive. It would seem that Yeats was hardly troubled throughout his life by the memory of this upstart. Crowley, on the other hand, would soon identify himself with the \"Beast\" whose hour had, in fact, \"come round at last.\" Contrary to Ye ats, he did not envision this as a position of enmity towards man. The forces being unleashed upon the human race during the coming century he saw as birth pangs, a necessary tilling of the soil for a new and essential seeding. The falcon could not hear the falconer but Crowley sought to hear the falcon. Thus it was that the Hawk-Headed God spoke through the medium of his new bride the words which were to color the rest of his life, Liber Al Vel Legis. Crowley also felt that this text was to color the lives of every human being on the plan­et ... for the next 2,000 years. IV THE VISION OF LIBER AL, is decidedly apocalyptic. For a man who emphatically identified himself with the number 666, his Holiest of Holy Books evokes an atmosphere reminiscent of that set forth by the historic originator of (and, one might observe, antagonist towards) the symbolism, St. John of Patmos. St. John's vi sion is both Christic and comprehensive. It is a book of symbolic sequences and spiritual stages. He foretells of future tribulation and an ultimate redemption and reward.

To seriously examine this approach is to make our way towards the \"Blazing Star\" of the Freemasons. Or as Crowley himself put it: One Star in Sight. v PRIOR TO THE RISING OF THIS STAR in the sequence of images com­prising the Major Arcana of the Tarot, we find a stage in the Greal Work identified as The Tower. In traditional packs, this card depicts an edifice being struck by lightning issued from above. One is reminded of the Biblical Babel and Judgment made by a Divine Being upon the hubris of his own creation. This is radically altered in Crowley's revisionist approach to the Tarot, assisted by the artistry of Frieda Harris. The image we find in the Thoth deck of Aleister Crowley is more magickal than moral. The tower is cubist and yet serpentine. It is not only an emblem of the virile phallus; it is the phallus in orgasmic dynamism. This suggests a much more positive and creative interpretation of what was a two-dimensional image of destruction. Human sexuality is intrinsically linked to human procreation. Just as the rising and falling of the phallus is cyclic, so is the indi­vidual life it begets, a cycle of endless birth and death. Picasso, also expressing the pulse of life in cubist form, observed Ihat \"Every act of creation is first an act of destruction.\" Every moment we breathe sees the birth of possibility into manifestation Ihrough the death of all that has gone before. Our dissolution and departure from physical form also takes its place in this endless process of creation. The Tower is not a Gateway to the Mysteries of Death per se.

It is clearly a marriage be­tween the ideas of the established edifice and the frenzied force which can tear it asunder. The moralistic reading of this symbolism sees God Almighty hurling a thunderbolt from Heaven to remind Man that he cannot hope to lift off from the parapets of his prison nor slide between the bars on the cage of creation. This oppressive and imprisoning Deity is a core theme in Gnostic thought. The thing worshipped as the \"Supreme Being\" or \"Grand Architect of the Universe\" is viewed as a false god, a demented and senile creature who fash­ioned form to bind the True God in a dismembered and broken state. Schools of Gnostic thought have risen from this premise to conclude that our earthly lives are an imperfection to be risen above, setting mortal life at odds with the ideal of eternality. This is not particularly helpful. Should we entertain such a view, we fi nd ourselves trapped in duality which maintains division as its keynote. We are still lost in the \"Mosaic Pavement\" and subject to its vicissitudes. Crowley does not deny the existence of God. Rather he gives the world a wholly different definition of the word: There is no God but Man. If this is so, we find that it is MAN hurling the thunderbolt upon his own creation. It is self-destruction. We divide ourselves into the figures cast out from the structure. Male and female, we cre­ate ourselves. Seeing the image from this perspective, we can take responsibility and engage with life. The Existentialism of the last century brought this theme to the fo re.

He decides that the most au­thentic course of living must take personal responsibility for even this phenomenon. Therefore, Haller determines that he must not leave his death to the caprice of nature. To do so is the route of those who evade this fundamental fact. Therefore, Harry Haller has set the time and date of his own suicide. Is this an act of courage, bravery or authenticity? Haller seems to think so.

His fellow man seems to be neither: lukewarm, un­feeling and already dead. We might find in Haller's self-image a type of Crowley's \"Beast.\" There is an emphasis in Crowley on this creature being not some archetype of evil, inimical to the human race, but rather having \"the number of a man.\" It is a peeling back of artifice to embrace what lies beneath. \"Authenticity\" and \"True Will\" may be regarded as interchangeable terms.

Liber AL scorns the \"professional soldiers\" and extols the merit of the True Warrior. This does not imply an embrace of violence as something heroic or noble in and of it­self. Rather, it points to the Art of our combat, our striving, and our coming into conflict with opposition. In the words of Carlos Castendeda: The basic difference between a warrior and an ordinary man is that a warrior takes everything as a challenge while an ordinary man takes everything as a blessing or a curse. Crowley wrote in Magick in Theorl? and Practice that when one has aligned with the True Will, one is assisted by the \"inertia of the universe.\" Yet we find, in our day to day life, that deciding upon the course of Will and acting in accordance with it, can sum­mon tremendous opposition.

The founding document, dictated by a \"prreternatural intel­ligence\" announces a rending of the veil and denouncement of all previous religious systems as defunct. It is interesting in this regard to observe Crowley's comments on Taoism, a religion be­longing to the \"Aeon\" previous to last (as did the Egyptian culture through whose symbolic lens the revelation came) . Writing to his \"Magickal Son\" in Liber Alepb, Crowley states: Thou knowest well how I keep from me all Taint of Fable, or of any Word unproven or undemonstrable. First then I speak of Lao-Tze, whose Word was TAO. Hereof have I already written much unto thee, because His Doctrine hath been lost or misinterpreted, and it is most needful to restore it. This theme of \"restoration\" is vital in Thelemic thought. Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam all lend influence to the development of his philosophy and the symbolic forms which embody it. Even Christianity, viciously assaulted in both Liber AL and Crowley's subsequent writings, is understood as potentially restorable as a \"Solar-Phallic Religion\" for the Present Aeon. With these and other observations, we find the violent over­throw of previous religious thought depicted in AL 3: 49-56 to por­tend a cleansing or purification stage in a global human alchemy. The Tower of Temples testifying to these falsehoods is also the clay body of Adam, awaiting the life-bestowing breath of the Most High. It is torn down and reduced to dust that it may be sum­moned to rise again in its \"restored\" or \"spiritual\" state. This is one meaning of the Christic Resurrection.

Naked Lunch. The book as it ended, left its protagonist, the junkie-writer William Lee, fleeing from the law, having been targeted for crimi­nal activity far beyond his possession of narcotics. Strangely, the interest in Lee was focused on the things he had written, mind­crimes of an unknown but particularly threatening nature. When Naked Lunch was first published, the book aroused tre­mendous controversy for its so-called obscenity. Decades latcr, we find it on the shelves of chain booksellers. Was its content vindi­cated or simply assimilated? Modern American culture has broken through censorship of \"o l� fe nsive material\" to the point where, with adequate financial back­ing, anpthing goes. Yet information still remains repressed and ollr attention is continuously diverted down drainpipes, built about our brains like the bars of a cage. William Lee flees to the home of his friend Mary and the fo llow­ing conversation ensues: \"Scientists have perfected the anti-dream drug, which is, log­icallya synthetic v<lriation on the junk theme ...

Naked Lunch assaulted hundreds of years of societal aversion to its own dark underbelly. It is a significant work of literature but only one amongst many with regards to the unseemly subject matter it gives voice to. Crowley foresaw the rise of such dark forces from the collective unconscious, impinging on the species with catastrophic consequence. Indeed, Liber AL paints a picture of conflict and conflagration, \"labor pains\" shaking the earth as the Child is born in blood.

As Burroughs expressed in his fiction, the nauseating potential of the Atomic Bomb to kill the very Soul finds its reflex in the Soul's potential to obliterate the forces in command of such devas­tation. The increasing dissolution of our deeply held fears towards sex, death and all subsurface energy beyond rational comprehen­sion is calling up what Michael Bertiaux calls the \"Transcendental Id,\" a force which can only be embodied in the \"Monstrous Soul.\" The reaction to the rise of this Beast is not consciously structured. Tales of the Illuminati masterminding global dominance smoke­screen the real opposition, operating beneath the stratum of the conscious mind. XI WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE UNIVERSE being in a state of growth, movement and transformation from our vantage point in the Timezone. From a transpersonal and trans-spatial angle, events perceived as sequential may now be understood as simultane­ous. In other words, the past and future are not places we may access by techniques of time travel resembling motion in a vehi­cle, from point A to point B. Rather, our time traveling machines are the particular set-ups we find useful for evoking conscious­ness transcending these ideas of temporal and spatial distinction. When this is attained, we may then \"condense\" our focus and find it landing at a given juncture outside of our personal calendrical consciousness. The topic of esoteric time travel points to the nature of con­lacts which have been and are being forged with what we shall call Extraterrestrial Intelligences.

We are not turning to telepathic teachings which might replace tapping our own wells of wisdom nor are we \"bowing the knee\" to imagined \"Superior Beings.\" Crowley cuts to the chase when he states: Mysticism is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Magick is the raising of oneself to their level. It is our Gnosis which facilitates the \"getting into communication\" with these entities. Our path of warriorship is our Magick, rais­ing us, step by step, to that level. We are, from this perspective, becoming alien. Or, perhaps better put, we are realizing the part of ourselves which is alien, which is fashioned from star-stuff. One modern writer on Buddhist thought observes: Life ... is a subatomic thing. The heavier elements in the hu­man body - all the ones heavier than iron - are derived from supernovae, giant exploding stars that lit the heavens eons before our own solar system was born. Supernovre, then, are integral to the existence of the human race. They seem so far away, so ancient, yet they are one with us.' The Star is not only a primary symbol in Thelemic writing but one of the most ancient of images embodying our innate longing for that which is Beyond.

For this reason, many modern Freemasons take pains to disassociate this prominent symbol from its historicaL philosophical and occult origins, ascribing to it a purely \"moral\" meaning. This image, however, is one of many in the Lodgeroom which speaks to Freemasonry's deep reach into the wisdom and knowl­edge of the past as it relates to the most progressive and modern views on science and spirituality. Fusing symbols from a great di­versity of such sources, Masonry utilized the past to aim at and springboard into the future. Albert Pike, known to have borrowed liberally from Eliphas Levi in his reworking of and commentary on Scottish Rite ritual, did not gloss over his treatment of this symbol. Ultimately he connects it to the Dog-Star or Sirius. Pike lived through the American Civil War, serving as a Confederate General. UFO phenomena was not a frequently docu­mented event during this time. The association between Sirius and the so-called Greys had yet to emerge. After years of deep study and research in the areas of world religion and occult literature, Pike would view Sirius as a vital component of the ancient myster­ies, an element to be restored to its proper place of significance in the modern world by means of the Fraternity's influence. In his extensive commentary on the ritual work of the Scottish Rite, Pike interprets the astro-mythos of Sirius in terms of Anubis assisting Isis in her quest for the severed pieces of her husband's body. Sirius-Anubis thus embodies a key agent in a profound unifica­tion, first of the Self (Osiris) and then of the divided sexes. This union will ultimately evoke Horus, who speaks through the pra­eternatural intermediary of Aiwass. Anubis walks between Life and Death. It is therefore unsurpris­ing that his Star has served to open a Gateway between human and ext raterrestrial minds. just as Isis and Osiris, aided by the Dog-God, may realize the hirth of Horus, the link between the human and transhuman func­tion, to unleash the Aeonic Current manifest as the hawk-headed l;od.

The ordeal of the Tower, now seen as the shattered body of Osiris, is meant to lead us further through the tarot keys, whereby the Star shall rise and find the ideal field for its manifestation. It is my opinion that a denial of any other intelligent life form in the cosmos is both arrogant and ignorant . Few, if any, of us are in possession of the technological apparatus whereby we might ap­proach \"contact\" in the physical sense of the word. As Magicians, however, we are not overly driven in this direction. The Beings we have alluded to do not reside on the far edges of our known uni­verse, inhabiting a planet similar to ours. Their distance may be unimaginable and yet we have opened a door of communication by means of a factor distinct from physical considerations. The extraterrestrial is the upsurge of the futuristic potential in human consciousness, realizing itself in the present. The Star is MAN and this is given special emphasis in Crowley's Cultus. We are, in our most primordial origins, made of star-stuff. Every star is a SUN. Sirius has been known as \"The Sun Behind The Sun,\" the future Star behind the present Self. The emphasis on entities in Space seems to be a mythic projection of ourselves outside of TIME. Thus, the occult techniques of \"Space TraveL\" such as the utilization of the \"Mask of LAM\" as interdimensional exploratory space-craft (see Kenneth Grant 's The Lam Statement), are a guise for transcending the self-identification of our tempo­ral ego (via the Mask) and evoking awareness of the potencies of the future (Maat-the \"future Aeon\") that they may be more readily realized in our present.

Forced to move ahead through time or perish, hounded by death-dogs and bombarded by forces meant to dehumanize and assimilate us, what weapons can we possibly wield? Where is our hope in Hell? A very valuable key is found in Kenneth Grant's Outside The Circles Of Time, where he cites Michael Bertiaux: ... become a monster and escape that pathway, that alone is the doorway of the Daathian portal of total darkness. I have told you that all avenues of escape are blocked, but in truth there is the doorway of becoming a monster, by becoming the beast, so that thereby you can escape by the very door they came through. Know, also, that this door is always open and that ingress from beyond is a constant threat ... by this means only the magician can escape from this universe into the next system of worlds. This imagery may sound fantastic but as we examine the environ­ment in which this scenario is cast, we will find vital importance in these words. The Tower is struck by lightning but is itself a volcanic phal­lus from whose pinnacle the forked and flaming fluid flies. If the darkened canopy of starless heaven would drape and dissolve this edifice, it rises up to rend the veil of night which would fa in cloak its vital life. The blanket of this devouring darkness is the Assaultive Abyss into which we thrust and plunge. This night CAN tear each and every brick of our being into a swirling dust devil. Conversely, it may become the field of possibility where our dissolution is willed for the purpose of a grand transmutation which we, ourselves, have set into motion. The bottomless pit becomes a cauldron, an alchemic vessel in which the cosmic creation moves forward.

I will interpret everJ? phenomena as a particular dealing of God with mJ? soul. This act begins the process of total assimilation of all forces and factors in nature and our experience of it. So, one may ask, how does this differ from a complete ego-centering of the self? Here Crowley adds his own symbolism to the original ideas of the Golden Dawn, finding the fulfillment of this ordeal in the sin­gle and last drop of blood drained into the \"Cup of Babalon.\" The entire field of experience has been apprehended without the selective process whereby we favor one event over another. Having obliterated this division between \"sheep and goats\" we will have fo und that even our complex minds have become subject to the process. The ego, in this sense, has used itself as a reference point for the purpose of eradicating itself. One does not physically die (and it might be argued that physi­cal death does in no wise automatically augment this initiation!). One does not forget one's given name or \"Drop out of the World.\" Rather the world is embraced in its totality and by world we may we ll use Wittgenstein's definition, \"that which is the case.\" Or all that is the case, all that could ever BE the case. Power and control works with the management and manipu­lation of categories and divisions. The Abyss unites the divided world in such a manner that the impinging forces of any one po­larity hold no more sway over the magician. He prefers no one event over another and thereby becomes one with the event be­hind all events.

The usual conventions of such a ceremony were dispensed with in favor of an intrapsychic experience whereby the Eucharist would be astrally established and imbibed in conjunction with the activated energies of kundalini. The dynamics of the ritual bear some similarity to the LAM­Serpent Sadhana, developed by Michael Staley (see Starfire vol II issue I). Having performed an adapted version of this ceremony several hundred times, it seems only natural that it would influ­ence the present rite.

It is a system of Gnostic thought and power which unites Heaven and Earth as one realm. The changes we observe rising and falling in our experience relate to its pattern and complex of relationships. Order and Chaos fuse into a synergistic whole in this system which Bertiaux calls \"the highest form of Gnostic Magick\".

The All­Seeing Eye of which we have spoken sheds its supernal light upon this union. I had wondered for some time at the astrological attribution of this card to Saturn. Saturn is a planet typically linked with limi­tation, contraction, binding, and restriction. Some writers on the science of the stars have sought to redeem the ringed globe's bad reputation by taking a positive view of the challenges and set­backs we are presented with in Life. However, as we come to the grand climax of our voyage on the Royal Road, as we behold this most magnificent image, both sensuous and cosmic, we have to wonder how it relates to Saturn, to Father Time, to the cannibalis­tic devourer of his own progeny, the image of heavy laden sorrow. I had never quite understood this beyond twisting ideas around to fo rce a fit. It was only when my own Guru assigned me to work with this particular energy and Intelligence that I broke through intellect and entered the gnosis of Saturn. In classical astrology, Saturn was the outer ridge of our known universe. The association of this planet with restriction was quite apropo as it was the gateway between our ordered universe and lh hao which surged beyond. If Saturn fu nctioned as a barrier (and subsequently radiated its restrictive qualities into our every­day affairs), it also partook of what was on the other side."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"XVI The physical planet is characterized by an extraordinarily intense climate, raging windstorms moving across its surface at incredible speeds.

Serving as the outpost of outermost space, the orbit of Saturn moves along the contours of the body of Nuit. As the container, binder and restrictor, Saturn embodies the cosmic Will manifest in the singularity of action in any given moment through the Will of the Magician. Saturn is also the lover of Venus. In their union, the two fuse into Kali, black goddess of time. Between her dancing legs are the fires of the crematorium which are also the fires of Eternity. These flames leap about and lick the Tower, tearing it down, building it up, absorbing its energy and bestowing it with life. The Tower first shows us the crisis and then indicates the way in which we are to walk, the Tao behind the appearance of conflict. If the Tower is our Illumination, then the arcana known as The World is that which is fully illumined. Willpou not ask for Light? The source of this light is the invisible fire.

Drugs, those fantastic alchemical materials that can catalyse heaven or hell, are the key ingredients of many mag­ickal systems. Where would the witch be without her cauldron of solanacere? Where would the shaman be without his power plants? Where would the alchemist be without the philosopher's stone, or the druid without those droplets of inspiration?

Crowley famously soaked himself in \"cognac, cunt and cocaine\". He plunged into plant induced alerted states, treading a path that propelled magick out of the doldrums and into the modern age. Uncle Aleister and many of his contemporaries were interested in exploring consciousness through chemical means. Crowley played around with opiates, cocaine, hashish and was a pioneer explorer of peyote. He made good use of these chemicals in his rituals. fa ­mously spiking the audience at his Rites of Eleusis with mesca­line. Crowley wanted to generate a religious ecstasy in attendees. a project that was at the core of his mission to promote the cult of Thelema. The Rites of Eleusis aimed to transform the Victorian ladies and gentlemen in London's Caxton Hall. into modern pa­gans.

However, within the more outre groups, such as Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, some freestyle shamanic practioners and many people who would call themselves Thelemites or chaos magicians, 'chemognosis' is alive and well. And it's not as though we have got a shortage of these things. Indeed on a planet where we're used to hearing about species go­ing extinct, in the wonderful world of psychoactives, new ones seem to be being discovered every week. Not only do we have all those novel designer chemicals (of which the phenethylamines such as MDMA are the best known) but also thousands of organic sources. Some of these are (at least to western culture), new mate­rials (such as the brain blisteringly potent salvia divinorum, or the gently fuzzy blue lotus of the Nile). Whatever their source, people in the early 21't century, especially in the industrialised world, have access to a staggering variety of consciousness altering substances. We have modern alchemists to thank for this situation. Albert Hofmann, father of LSD. and Alexandra Shulgin, the godfather of rave culture, who in 1976 synthethised and thoughtfully tested MDMA on himself. Many of these discoveries come wrapped in their own synchronistic, some might say magickal. packaging. Hofmann discovered the reality shattering effects of LSD as a re­sult of accidentally ingesting the chemical he was working on. A chemical that he created five years before in 1938 (just as World War II was about to kick off). As the war drew to a close, Hoffman writing in LSD Mp Problem Child says: A peculiar presentiment - the feeling that this substance could possess properties other than those established in the fi rst investigations - induced me, five years after the first synthesis, to produce LSD-25 once again so that a sample could be given to the pharmacological department for fur­ther tests. This was quite unusual; experimental substances, as a rule, were definitely stricken from the research program if once found to be lacking in pharmacological interest. One famous bicycle ride through wonderland later, and the rest as they say, is history. But ah, all those fantastically twisted plot de­vices! The CIA ge t interested in LSD as a mind control drug. They had already been snifHng arollnd, trying to score magic mush­rooms with Gordon Wasson's explorations of Mexican shamanism. lOCI"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE ECSTATIC STATE So the CIA are the ones that the gods choose to distribute LSD to the youth of America! The CIA dump the stuff into the brains of undergraduate research subjects, including the people who would become counter-cultural icons, such as Ken Kesey. They may also have covertly been bankrolling a Harvard lecturer in psychol­ogy, one Timothy Leary. The stable door of modern psychoactive culture was flung open by those very organisations that are now charged with re-capturing the horses that have long since bolted. How does this peculiar situation link with contemporary eso­teric practice? Much of my own activity, and that of the magicians I've been fortunate to work with, has been about creating new rituals that serve to contain and indeed amplify the new psychoac­tives that are available today. Let me give you three examples. KETAMINE THIS IS A DISASSOCIATIVE ANAESTHETIC. It is typically used in anaesthesia of children, the elderly, burns victims and, famously, horses. It is a chemical worth getting to know because it's increas­ingly used in palliative care. At the end of your life it's quite likely that it will be ketamine that will send you off into the realm of the ancestors. The basic ketamine trip is that of becoming aware of consciousness as it re-emerges. A high enough dose of the drug will knock you out and the trip arises as awareness and memory comes back on line. Ketamine makes you loose contact with your body. Its disasso­ciative action means that you loose the sense of where you end and, for instance, the curtains begin. So one way we've discovered you can work with this material is through the process of mum­mification. The participant is naked, then wrapped neck to foot in Clingfilm (black Clingfilm is best). Then a large dose of ketamine is administered by insufflation and the head is then bound with only the nostrils remaining uncovered. Floating in a memory-less state the participants finds themselves in a world deep underground, rooted in the muladhara chakra's chthonic darkness. The other ritualists judge the time after the ketamine has been taken (perhaps taking low doses themselves) and begin to chant, moving up through the seed syllable mantras of each centre. As memory comes back on line the mummified magician feels their conciousness awakening, dividing from the l07"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"XV) unified null state. As this happens and the chanting around them builds towards the Sahasrara so a pair of bandage scissors are used to open the cocoon. As the plastic binding falls away so the subject emerges, first imagining themselves as a flowing liquid. Then real­ising they have limbs, a form, and that they can move in emerging space of separate existences. This ceremony is a powerful initia­tion; a death and resurrection. TOAD VENOM ANOTHER TYPE OF RITUAL can be performed with the formidable power of 'toad venom', 5-MeO-DMT, which has been (perhaps cor­rectly) described as the most powerful entheogen on the planet. In this ritual the sacrament is central to a rite of trance where the aim is to connect to the life force of the planet. In this ceremony a space is made, ideally outdoors, and participants circumnambulate the location, each coming forward to partake of the four elements; scented herbs for air, honey for fire, water and the feel of rich earth. Then they kneel on blankets, animal skins or the grass, and the white perfumed smoke of the toad venom is administered. A simple drum beat and a lilting chant help the psychonauts to dive into the heart of the power in the earth. Rivers of dark DNA swim in front of their eyes. There are none of the typically bright visions that the venom's sister chemical, N,N-DMT of Terence McKenna fame, can produce. Instead there is a sense that one is expanding down and simultaneously, outward. Into the cellular heart of crea­tion, out into the radiant darkness of space and then all around there is nothing but light, light, light! FOXY METHOXY A FINAL EXAMPLE OF AN ENGAGEMENT, this time with the aphro­disiac of psychedelic Pan, namely 5-MeO-DiPT or foxy methoxy. A pharmacological sister to DMT, Foxy is so called because of an ar­ticle in Playboy Magazine that favourably commented on its erotic potential.

Since at low dose the visual disturbance is minimal and cognition remains good, this is an ideal sacrament to combine with group ritual. even fairly elaborate processes. I remember a rite to Abraxas featuring an elemental healing process, an invocation of the chicken headed deity and the cracking of a giant golden egg, but that, as they say, is another story. NOW INTERESTINGLY, there are some ways of getting ecstatic which are less fraught with legal problems in our culture. A few years ago I was hanging with two chest piercings through my skin from an ancient yew somewhere on the south coast of England. And it wasn't just me, there were seven of us similarly wounded and dancing, stretching cords from our bodies to a ring of rope round the tree. Leaning backwards, letting the tug of the hooks pull at our flesh. For some of us there was plenty of blood. Funny that if a police officer had walked past it would have been more legitimate to be doing this (although I recognised there is legislation that could have been involved to prosecute us for our English style sundance) than being mummified on ketamine. And why is this? The fact is that we, the industrialised world (and most of the rest of the planet who follow what our governments do) have a deeply abiding fear of drugs. Now it's true that drugs and drug use are problematic. But mak­ing these things illegal. as with alcohol prohibition in the early 20,10 century in the United States, does not make the problem go away. In fact it makes things much, much worse. Drugs can be useful in shocking us out of habitual patterns of behaviour, allowing us per­ceive the world anew. However, they can also be cages of drunken violence, of habituation, addiction and sorrow. But it is no news to say that the flip side of heaven is hell or the shadow of ecstasy is despair. The fact is that as a culture we need to own this responsi­bility, not keep brushing the white powder under the carpet in the hope that it will go away. Every time a locus of ecstasy appears in our culture it is stamped on. Not in a big conspiracy way, but simply out of habit. Mushrooms go on sale openly in London's Camden market, within months legislation is rushed through to stop it. New chemicals created with ecstatic and therapeutic potential are banned in the 201)"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"XVI blink of a eye. Those most public manifestations of ecstatic society, such as Rave culture and even latterly pub culture have been out­lawed, squeezed and redefined by the state. Personal ecstasy may be dangerous but collective, communal ecstasy is social dynamite. Why are we - as a society, as a species - so afraid of this material ecstasy? Is it born from the lingering horror that, in true Tantric style, it is the physical world, in this case chemicals, that are our means of our liberation? We've been told how we need to pray, to do good works, to trust in the Lord, when in fact we can get a reliable religious experience from a good dose of psilocybin and a little ritualisation? Timothy Leary's research student Walter N. Pahnke, proved this in 1962 when he gave a group of divinity stu­dents mushrooms in Boston University's chapel, just prior to the Good Friday service. Unsuprisingly (to anyone who has taken this entheogen), all those who were dosed reported profound religious experiences, experiences indistinguishable in their phenomonol­ogy from mystical experiences reported in other contexts. Just to check the results of this experiment (and rather as though the last forty-four years hadn't happened) the experiment was repeated in 2006, and produced exactly the same results. Both communist and capitalist, left and right, politicians want to keep prohibition in place. Terrence McKenna commented on this, suggesting that it was the radical ontological unpicking of reality which psychedelic drugs produce that meant the State had to ban them. In common with many other commentators he also pointed out how those drugs that speed the wheels of industry (or the means of production, if you prefer) such as caffeine, that take our minds off the dullness of the day (tobacco), or blot out the pointlessness of our struggle (booze) are all perfectly acceptable. The general profile of which psychoactives remain legal remains unchanged, though the chemicals drafted in may vary. Of course, to calm the masses with opium (as we did in Victorian times) would be terrible; instead we provide Prozac snuggles for downtime, and a Red Bull pick-me-up for when the going gets tough. Frequently, voices are raised about this insanity. Most recently a chief science advisor to the British Government lost his posi­tion after having the temerity to suggest that taking drugs such as MDMA really didn't deserve to be considered as dangerous as some perfectly legal activities. Professor David Nutt, the man in question, described the Kafkaesque process of drug classification in his lecture of July 2009, published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at Kinp,s Collep,e London: IIO"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"THE ECSTATIC STATE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: You can't compare harms from a legal activity with an illegal one.

MP: You can't compare harms from a legal activity with an illegal one. Good grief! No wonder this academic lost his job! He's clearly in­sane, whereas our wise politician has got a perfect grip on things ... Yet in the British Isles, and round the globe, there are many religions that make use of the ecstatic power of drugs. From the Rastafari movement, orthodox Hinduism, the Peyote users of North America and the ayahuasca users of South America. These and many other movements exist which are being informed by the core principle of what Aleister Crowley called Thelema, namely that personal revelation through ecstatic experience is what reli­gion is all about. Not adherence to some garbled Holy Book wheth­er it be the Koran, King James or indeed The Book of the Law. So what are we, what are you as magicians doing about this? Make no mistake our time has come. That's why although some of the ecstatic cults are informed by the works of Crowley and west­ern esoteric culture, many are not. Thelema is one formulation of this psycho-historic force, a force that is popping up in rave culture as much as it is in the burgeoning numbers of the various psych­edelic religions. And the tide is turning. The Santo Daime Church and the Uniao do Ve getal, both international religions that use an ayahuasca style brew, have had significant legal victories in the United States and elsewhere. They have won the right to import their DMT rich sacrament into the most prohibitionist of jurisdic­tions. The changes are coming and they are going to leave groups like the Ordo Templi Orient is and squeaky clean Wicca behind as quaint anachronisms of muddled Masonry, unless they focus their attention on what really matters. What matters is the core spirit of these traditions, the spirit of ecstasy as a valid spiritual path. Whnt matters is changing the law of the land, of maturing as a culture so we can make use of the plethora of psychoactives that we hove access to without running screaming into the orl1l s of the Nanny State or addicted oblivion . 111"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"XVI This doesn't mean we all have to take drugs.

Screams rend the night, but they are screams not of terror in the face of the disaster but of delight, revelling in the sight and heat and light of this spectacular catastrophe. For around the blazing tower's periphery is a great moat. Once the final check was done, the drawbridge was drawn up so that none could cross over; the fire was lit as the clock tolled thirteen on New Millennium's Eve. And so the only victim of the great blaze was the mighty Millennium Bug, a 10 foot high insect whose textured fabric skin soon flamed and melted revealing metal bones within.

Another harbour seemed unnecessary, and upon in­vestigation they did indeed discover that it was primarily an ex­cuse to dump a vast amount of toxic waste in a great pit and build the damned thing over the top. The villagers of Ruigoord were all part of The Balloon Company, whether as performers, costumers, carpenters or cooks, and had a cohesive co-operation born of long term co-creation. They had occupied the forest valiantly in organized protest for many moons, keeping bulldozers at bay with various physical tactics while also bauling with more mental strategies in courts of law.

Though it would seem insane or at least inane to fight fire with fire. to blow up the corporate office of those responsible and reciprocate the very values we were protesting against, we could and did fight bark with symbolism and magical intent. even with artistry.

By this stage there were thousands of people everywhere, not just around the fires but walking about excitedly, milling between them and thronging around the moat. I heard the next day there had been an estimated five or six thousand present at midnight. After doing my acoustic voice and violin thing for a while the Rinky Dink pedal-powered PA and its travelling band who had come from England for the celebrations, pedalled over from the African fire and set up around me. I plugged in and joined them for a celtic folk jam, as their mates back in England hollered in midnight. By the time the twelve o'clock fire was to be lit it was a barely noticeable activity, as there were now people everywhere, filling all the space between the fires as well as around them, and crowd­ing around the moat in expectation. Nevertheless, we carried the fire to the final position and closed the great circle. There was no one cultural representative as the time-zone was 12:00 midnight Mediterranean Europe including Netherlands, ie Here and Now! So it was apt that the gathering was by now decentralized from the fire, spreading across the whole scene. I poured the last of the lamp oil on the 12th fire and it blazed as the first fireworks went off. I had not been expecting the amount of spectacle the Balloon Co. had quietly invested in this aspect of the celebrations. From midnight til 1 am there were fireworks galore, exploding all around us from every possible angle. As it grew later they came mostly from the Tower, shooting up out of it into the stars, whilst smaller fireworks crackled brightly across its looming structure, drawing everyone's focus onto this axis mundi. People were drumming and screaming and dancing. The energy was very high. It had been a stroke of brilliance to burn the Tower at 13 o'clock, not midnight as everyone would expect at a New Year celebration, carrying our anticipatory energy further and higher.

It had been at the edge of the tower since the night before, when it had been removed from the centre and the time capsules beneath dug up. A while later in went the Dragon, fire spouting from its nostrils - the creation of Fritjof (the Mastermind behind the whole Tower project), it had a great painted sculpted head and white cloth body borne by nine people in the Chinese parade tradition. When first hearing of this plan during the weeks of preparation for the festival, more pieces had fallen into place in the cosmic jigsaw puzzle of it All. I had discovered that the original Tower of Babel was a Temple to Marduk, aligning with the concept I had been exploring of Marduk chopping up Tiamat in the establish­ment of linear time. Tiamat as the primal chaos dragon was divided into sections - hours, weeks, months, years - by the sword of the solar hero Marduk, representing the cycles of the sun and linear logic. Our civilization's 12/60 division timekeeping artifice actually comes from the Babylonians. So the burning of Marduk's Temple (sym­bolized by the Tower of Babel structure at Ruigoord) signifies a return of the lunar spiral dreamtime of 13 moons, the tower being the 13th fire, through which the purging kundalini of Tiamat (or The Midgard/Rainbow/Feathered Serpent rising towards the end of time in multiple cultural pantheons) flows as the fire-breath­ing Dragon was carried spiralling up the stairwell of civilization. Tiamat restored to fluid wholeness. The Dragon looked spectacular as it weaved in over the moat. The Rinky Dink crew and their bizarre pedalled PA contraption followed them over the bridge. I was on the bike, pedalling like mad. We circled around the Tower as the Dragon went up, and I chanted the chakra tones through a microphone as the great Serpent ascended, a note of the octave for each level of the Tower as the Serpent reached it. With the cheering and drumming of the masses, the kundalini of the Thirteenth Tribe purged civilization in a DNA double-helix up and then down the Tower. As it returned to earth, four friends gathered around me and shared the microphone, adding power to the final low base chakra tone of manifestation.

The Fool was actually born on April Fool's Day, and the production was first performed at the start of his recurring 33 and a third birthday. During the manifestation of this work in the form of a Ritual Opera(tion) the outer world came crashing in on us again: crashing down, as twin towers fell to the aerial assault of (apparently) eastern powers on September 11th, with most interestingly synchronous timing for our project(ion). We had rehearsed the first half of the play, which was spawned on ayahuasca in the desert from the infernal and supernal device we called the Choronzon Machine, several times, but always ran out of time before we got any further than scene IV/XV: The Emperor/ The Devil. Each scene presented a dichotomy between two reflec­tive tarot trumps (as spun by Jackal 1 on the Malkuth Wheel of the Machine itself, powered by illuminat-eye coins from the audience), a conflict or tension which was resolved by the scene's end when the two giant tarot cards were added to an increasingly precarious Tower of Cards at the front of the stage. Finally, at one rehearsal we decided to just start with the follow­ing scene V/XVI: The Hierophant/The Blasted Tower and work on the second half of the Ritual Opera. After the Hierophant's lecture on the Tarot Lemniscate which underlay the production, Jackals 2 and 3 hesitantly and with great care and trembling paws reached up to place the Blasted Tower trump against the Hierophant trump atop the giant House of Cards, while the Hierophant explained to the audience authoritatively that the Blasted Tower represents, Chaos ... Havoc ... Unexpected Change! However, as the jackals cringed expectantly the Tower did not fa ll, as that would not of course be unexpected.

I INTRODUCTION THE DENIZENS OF ANY HISTORICAL EPOCH usually fancy that they live at some special time or at some pivotal point in history. yet the annals of political. esoteric. and religious history lay littered with apocalyptic predictions that failed to materialise. Now the scientists have pitched in with their own versions of apocalypse. and according to a growing consensus amongst them we face multiple worldwide catastrophes that threaten civilisation itself within the lifetimes of most of those currently living. The staff and members of Arcanorium College devoted an en­tire semester to sifting through a mass of data and statistics. and hypotheses and projections in a huge number of academic papers and books to consider two questions: 1 What level of threat actually underlies the growing con­cerns about overpopulation. climate change and environ­mental degradation? 2 What response from the magical community seems appro­priate to such threats? It might seem unusual that a college devoted to the exploration of the theory and practice of magic might concern itself with such issues. However. magical and esoteric thought has always histori­cally played a leading role in the development of new paradigms and belief systems in science. religion and in the political sphere. and it appears that we basically approach a crisis which involves many of the core beliefs in those systems.

GLOBAL WARMING Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels do appear to roughly correlate with this planet's temperature. We appear to have almost doubled the levels since the advent of industrialization and we may at least double them again before we bring fossil fuel use under control. The planet's temperature has risen by about one degree and looks set to rise another degree even with no further carbon dioxide burden. The speed and extent of such further warming remains un­known but a global rise of more than a couple of degrees will have disastrous effects on world agriculture. The rise in human pro­duced carbon dioxide may trip a series of positive feedback loops that release catastrophic quantities of greenhouse gases from the land and the seas. A four degree rise in this planet's overall tem­perature means a fatal catastrophe for human civilization. RESOURCE EXHAUSTION The human race has based its post WWII boom in food production and transport and its steep increase in population and manufac­tured items almost entirely on oil. We may have already reached peak oil production anyway, but further use of fossil fuels can only add to global warming. The huge recent expansion in human num­bers and activity has led to serious environmental degradation and the loss of vast numbers of species already.

Plainly, the beliefs of scientists conflict severely with those held by many religious and political-economic lobbies. Few people seem happy with mutually contradictory belief systems, indeed many people will enthusiastically go to war over contradictory belief systems. So let us look at each of them in some detail before con­sidering which sides, if any, to take when attempting to devise a magical response. II THE DESIRABILITY OF GROWTH? FIRSTLY, overpopulation and growth economics. The scientists have already got this partly wrong at least once. Thomas Malthus wrote at the beginning of the nineteenth century that food pro­duction could only increase by adding a few million tons or so extra production each year by piecemeal increases in land use and agricultural technique improvements, so food can only incrense arithmetically, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5, etc, at the very best. However, he con­sidered that population would naturally increase exponentially I. 2. 4. 8.16, etc, as the more people you have the more extra people they all make. This led him to predict catastrophe. It seemed thnt human numbers would inevitably outstrip any possible increnses in food supply and mass mortality due to starvation, disease, or war would result. Such Malthusian dynamics keep all natural plant and animnl populations in check. Indeed disease and food supply, and to a lim­ited extent war (self-predation), kept human numbers fa irly low on a planetary scale until Malthus' time. Then they really begnn to take off, primarily because of mortality reduction due to bet­ter hygiene and the beginnings of modern medicine dramatically reducing infant mortality. We would have had a Malthusian catastrophe sometime nfter the middle of the last century, but two other fa ctors came into play. A so-called Green Revolution based on the massive use of artificial fe rtilizers and industrialized agriculture nllowed food production to suddenly step change to a higher level and a de­mographic adjustment occurred in developed nations where people no longer fe lt the need to reproduce as much as possible to guarantee their own survival in old age. However, continued 119"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"XVI population growth has now absorbed the surpluses created by the green revolution and global per capita food availability has begun to decrease. Furthermore, the damage inflicted by industrialized agriculture now begins to become apparent and the demographic adjustment seems to have fa iled to take place in huge tracts of the world where wealth creation has failed. It now seems unlikely that we can achieve sustainable adequate food production for 9+ billion people, particularly as the current production methods lack sustainability. The areas of the world where the Malthusian equation has hit hardest so far have become the hotbeds of political instability and accelerated environmental degradation and, in the context of a globalized world, the main sources of terrorism. From a scientific viewpoint we require a massive switch to styles of product and food production that do not depend on fossil fuels, or fe rtilizers that degrade the soil, coupled with a massive effort of persuasion to reduce population and consumption to sustainable levels. From a religious viewpoint demographic adjustment gener­ally seems undesirable. Faiths compete by breeding, and poverty breeds faith better than wealth does. Political-economic theories remain almost exclusively commit­ted to economic growth through increasing consumption and population increases. In Europe, where birth rates of the indige­nous population have fallen below replacement levels, the political classes have covertly encouraged immigration to maintain popula­tion growth in the hope that this will maintain economic growth. Politicians usually take a short-term view, particularly in de­mocracies that limit their tenure. Many seem to figure that if sci­ence got us into this mess it can get us out just as easily, despitethe rnct that few scientists exhibit much hope of quick technical fixes to the problems they envisage. Sometimes politicians even opine that humans themselves constitute the ultimate resource and that more people equals more possible solutions, however more starv­ing, uneducated and under-resourced people seem more likely to enlarge mther than solve such problems. Magicians, as habitual antinomians, might well take a dim view of nil of the above and in their characteristic observation-intuition .hought mode, come to the following conclusions: the world does appenr to hnve become uncomfortably crowded and more para­noid, the climate has obviously started to change and environmen­tal degmdation increases alarmingly. Optimism about the fu ture 240"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"ESCHATON seems in short supply and what little exists seems rather fragile. In the developed world the material standard of living seems to increase but the quality of life does not, and indeed it seems to have peaked several decades ago for many people, in the late 1960s in the USA and in the middle 1970S in Europe according to some sociological measures. In many of the undeveloped parts of the world both material standards and quality of life have declined, partly due to their population explosions, and partly due to the rapacious economic activity of the developed world. It seems that humanity has made a very large number of mis­takes, but they all seem to come down to variations on the same basic mistake: Humanitp bas mistaken Quantitp for Qualitp. More does not necessarily mean better. Two properly fed and educated children seem a better investment than six left half starved and stupid. Beyond a certain income level no further increment brings any increment in quality of life, and this income level corresponds to having sufficient food and shelter and the freedom to do some­thing interesting with one's leisure. The acquisition of ever more consumer goods and consumer ex­periences and the quest to consume competitively against ones so­cial peers does not actually bring any quality of life improvements at all according to psychologists, despite the vast industry of lies that we have created to promote these false assumptions. 'Virtue' brings life satisfaction but the effects of 'Pleasure' re­main ephemeraL as the ancient Greek philosophers realized long ago. By Virtue they meant service to others, the establishment of agreeable relationships and friendships, and personal achievement in terms of learning and self-improvement. Such things bring last­ing satisfaction. Pleasure, on the other hand, evaporates almost immediately, leaving little but a desire for more pleasure till it either becomes an addictive vice or so tedious that it needs replac­ing with another pleasure. Virtue brings Quality, Pleasure merely creates a demand for Quantity. Of course a vast industry of lies exists to promote the contrary view in developed nations because marketing pleasure proves fa r more profitable than marketing virtue. Thus it would seem that a battle for belief needs fighting to save humanity from the catastrophic consequences of overpopulation and over-consumption. Magicians specialize in the construction of belief systems, and thus they seem uniquely placed to assist with this. No major religion, with the possible exception of some forms 241"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"XVI of Buddhism, has much to offer here, so we may need to create another by integrating various minority ideas into a coherent al­ternative. Some form of panpsychic neo-Pantheism suggests itself. (see part v). ill RELIGION AND POLITICS MOST RELIGIONS do contain an ascetic aesthetic which values the inner life above the outer life of material acquisition and con­sumption, however most reserve this for their monks and nuns and mystics and for other specialized classes of holy people, who all usually remain celibate. However the great mass of believers in most religions live un­der rule systems designed to maximize reproduction through the control of sexual activity. Polygamy tends to evolve in cultures suf­fe ring high male losses in warfare; monogamy tends to evolve in agrarian cultures. Homosexuality, masturbation, contraception and other practices which may lower the reproduction rate tend to fall under religious prohibition, except where temporary homo­sexuality aids militarism. Religions compete as much by breeding as by proselytizing and fo rced conversion after military conquest. The 'Monotheist Phallacy' as we magicians call it, refers to the Abrahamic idea that some male deity created the world for our convenience and exploi­tation. This idea no longer seems tenable from an evolutionary or an ecological perspective. Confident that they can outbreed the Israelis, the Palestinians rejected a 'Two State Solution' in the Middle East, believing that they will eventually dominate demographically in a 'Single State Solution'. We seem to have a curious situation where full religious experi­ence demands asceticism and celibacy but ordinary religious ob­servance demands quite the reverse. Indeed, ordinary religious observance in most cultures consists largely of praying for improvements in material life and obeying rules for multiplying the population. At many stages in history the multiplication of population and advances in materiol conditions went hond in hond with eoch oth­er and with religion, but that era seems to have ended. Material 242"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"ESCHATON ease tends to erode religious faith. When you have medical care, freedom from serious want and oppression, and plenty of enter­tainment, little remains to seriously pray for. Religion has become a negligible social force in Europe, in America it remains loud but shallow, a mere add on to one's lifestyle and identity choices. However, in many parts of the underdeveloped parts of the world where religion itself has inhibited technical development and hence social development, population growth has led to di­minishing living standards and prospects. Paradoxically, this has not led to the rejection of religion but rather to virulent fu nda­mentalist forms of it, seemingly on the basis that if something fails we obviously need much more of it to make it work. A similar situation has developed with growth and consumerism in developed nations. It doesn't actually work, it fails to provide satisfaction, so obviously we need more of it, or so the mainstream economists and politicians tell us, and most people still believe them. Contraception now allows for the development of non-celibate forms of intense mystical and religious experience. Basic prosper­ity now allows for the development of ascetic political-economic behavior that seeks satisfaction in small scale quality rather than through trash in quantity. So where do the prophets of these phe­nomena lie? Well elements of these philosophies lie all around us in the writings of various tantrics, sex-magicians, hippy-anarchists, deep ecologists, neo-pantheists and other disaffected types, but the alternative movement currently lacks coherence and it fa ces fanatical opposition from the religious and political-economic establishments. IV THE WILD CARD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY effectively lie beyond social and politi­cal control. We cannot reliably anticipate what we may discover and invent, we cannot easily discover and invent to order, or un­invent anything. At best we ca n merely influence the rate of dis­covery and invention and try to prevent the use of technologies we don't like. l41"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"XV! We already have technical fixes for overpopulation, contraceptives or weapons of mass destruction, but we have an unwillingness to use them. We already have the technical ability to replace all fossil fuels with nuclear and renewable energy sources but we lack the collec­tive will to make the sacrifices of short term and vested interests to do this. We do not however, have the technical ability to double the world's yields of food, freshwater, and raw materials in a sustain­able way, and we seem unlikely to achieve this. We already have the technology to create consumer durables that will last many times longer than current models, and to achieve vast reductions in waste; but instead we use technology to create ever more spurious and disposable fashions and products for economic reasons. Decades ago we fondly imagined that science and technology would largely free us from most of the work, toil, and drudgery in our lives and leave us with endless time for leisure and our interests and pleasures. In fact quite the reverse has happened in 'developed' societies. Somehow we have ended up co-opting most of the females into the workforce as well, and ever vaster amounts of work get done due to technologically increased productivity, but few get any more leisure or any more satisfaction from the system, we just get busier and ever more time-oppressed. We do have the technology to produce quite enough for our life support and amusement needs with just a couple of days work a week, but the entire economic system that we have built works against such a more sensible arrangement. In particular, the artifi­cially high prices of food and shelter and the built in obsolescence of manufactured goods keeps everyone's nose to the grindstone. Capitalism works well enough to create wealth, but it also cre­ates an equal amount of un-wealth or 'ill-th' at the same time in the way of waste, pollution, artificial shortages, and a supply and a demand for shoddy and low quality goods and experiences. Despite the apparent economic freedoms capitalism confers, it actually acts effectively as a highly sophisticated command econ­omy by manipulating demand. Most people spend most of their waking lives working far longer than they want to for either over­priced necessities or for stuff they don't really want or need or derive much satisfaction from. Pe rhaps alone of all recent technologies, the internet offers a sensible alternative to a lot of consumerism. It offers the possibility 244"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"ESCHATON of virtually free music, entertainment, literature, knowledge and communication. Artists, writers, and creative types hardly need paying. Most of them do most of their best work before they get paid anything anyway. If nobody had to do more than two days work a week we would have an avalanche of creativity, people would do it for its own sake and the social kudos and to improve their mating opportunities. Much the same applies to scientists. Although society may some­times need to assist with equipment costs if it wants some areas investigated. However it does seem that the majority of funda­mental breakthroughs required little more than pencil and paper and time to think outside the box. (Newton, Darwin, Einstein, etc). At the time of writing the internet remains relatively demo­cratic and somewhat anarchic although in some nations it has al­ready become subject to censorship and political and moral polic­ing. Even in democratic countries politicians continually debate measures to police it in various ways and it seems appropriate to consider possible future political developments in this technology section. Military technology largely defines political reality. Athenian democracy applied only to the elite who could afford to equip themselves to join the hoplite phalanxes, or who had the spare time to crew the triremes. Feudalism arose from the battlefield superiority of armored cavalry. Democracy grew out of the ba r­rels of mass musket formations. Female emancipation came at the price of work in munitions factories. Communism arose from the effect of machine guns and the telegraph on half medieval socie­ties. The presidential dictatorships that dominate most of the third world depend on assault rifles and the control of communications. The current offensive ineffectiveness of mass conscript conven­tional armies depends partly on the existence of weapons of nH1SS destruction and partly on the huge defensive power of che'lp in­fantry weapons, but it poses a great threat to democracy. The political classes do not like democracy. Whilst it allows them to retire from duty whilst still alive, it plays hell with their job se­curity. When they cease to need massive armies they no longer need to offer democracy, particularly if civilians remain mainly unarmed, as in Europe. Only comparative freedom of communicll­tion now safeguards democracy, and it may not last. All around the world democracy seems in ret reat in rllVOI' of command 'mixed economies'.

In this emerging ED Synarchic system, a self-perpetuating coun­cil and bureaucracy of 'Those Who Know Best' governs as an un­elected oligarchy. The rule of law becomes corrupted by the impo­sition of impossible regulations that criminalize every imaginable activity, but which when selectively enforced yield to the political classes their Holy Grail of arbitrary power. Relatively free societies have till recently demonstrated eco­nomic and military superiority over less free ones because their citizens innovated more effectively, but this may change. As we begin to run out of resources more heavily controlled societies may demonstrate greater robustness against disorder and col­lapse. Restrictions on communication and freedom of expression will inevitably herald any moves towards more authoritarian government. In the meantime, the governments of both relatively free and highly controlled societies will continue to take the easy route of buying off popular dissent with economic growth, regardless of its well understood unsustainability, and the deteriorating climate. v THE MAGICAL RESPONSE A: Can the pursuit of Magic offer an attractive alternative to religion and the political-economic religion of consumer­ism? B: Would the widespread adoption of the pursuit of Magic reduce humanity's current suicidal reliance on religion and excessive consumption? Well as for (A), nothing brings more satisfaction in life than those 'magic moments' of creative insight, achievement, laughter, won­derment, ecstasy, self-knowledge, parapsychological success, and joy in the company of others. Basically, we live for such magical ex­periences without often realizing that whilst to some extent they depend on circumstances, we largely create them within ourselves."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"ESCHATON Magic has developed many techniques to explore these phenom­ena. Chief among them lays the meta-belief that we can treat belief as a technology rather than as an end in itself. The value of any belief lies in what effects it produces; the best ones produce plenty of meaningful magic moments. Magic can supply a far more effective antidote to religion than science. It can demonstrate how to reproduce all the effects of re­ligion, social, psychological. mystical and parapsychological. with­out all the dubious dogma or reliance on fixed counterintuitive belief structures. Science can merely point out the stupidity of religious beliefs whilst grudgingly admitting their occasionally beneficial conse­quences. Magic makes a more fundamental attack; it regards all beliefs, including scientific ones, as tools for achieving effects, and it selects or discards them on the basis of whether or not they produce those magic moments that make existence worthwhile. The magical quest for meaningful experience and beliefs 'that do what they say on the packet' involves the development of in­ner resources as much as outer ones. Indeed most magicians havc discovered that developing inner resources seems to encourage the outer resources they need for this to appear, as if by err, magic. Magicians prefer to develop powers of trance and meditation and visualization and the ability to divine and cast spells and to explore their own inner pantheons and make their own gods and sources of inspiration. Of course, this takes study and effort but they would argue that it brings meaningful peak experienccs more effectively than striving for ever more material consumption docs Personally, I only tend to value objects that I have made by hand myself, books which have presented a challenge to my understand­ing, and abilities that I have mastered. I care little for manufactured objects or vicarious experience, most entertainment seems dull in comparison to my own dreams. Amongst emerging magical paradigms, the new Chaos Magic tradition seems to have taken the broadest metaphysical approach and identified Magic as an all encompassing world view with its own take on religion, science, and art, which it views as sub-sets of itself. This new magic does not overly concern itself with ancient gri­moires and antique symbolic 'secrets', although it acknowledges the historical struggles that the magical world view has gone through in search of self consistency and consistency with obscr-247"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"XVI vation and experience. To this extent it has more in common with science than with religion. 'Quantum-Panpsychic-Neopantheism' probably best describes the default paradigm of Chaos Magic, the belief its practition­ers use when they're not using another one for some particular purpose. panpsychism means recognizing that everything has some degree of aliveness, even seemingly inanimate phenomena like planets, the weather, rocks, and teapots. The conventional view attributes aliveness only to very complicated structures like plants and animals and us, and possibly to very sophisticated or recalci­trant machines. However, quantum-panpsychism starts at the other end and recognizes aliveness in the basic building blocks of the universe, the fundamental particles or 'quanta', quarks, electrons, neutrinos, photons and so on. These all exhibit a degree of free wilUrandom behavior and a degree of memory/information retention. Relatively simple objects like rocks do not exhibit much more aliveness than their constituent particles but some complex struc­tures, particularly those conventionally designated as 'living or­ganisms' have structures which magnify the underlying quantum life signs up to macroscopic level. The Gaia hypothesis asserts that this whole planet acts as a sort of vast living organism. Most magi­cians regard the weather system as alive in some sense. Personally, I attribute life to rocks, but they live their lives so slowly that it usually escapes our attention. Of course, if everything has life it all deserves our respect and it may respond to our attempts to communicate and negotiate with it. The theory that everything 'lives' goes by the name of Pantheism, the idea of a god or gods in all phenomena and not separate to them. Mind/information and matter/energy consist of the same mysterious substance. The universe thus consists of the insepara­ble mind and body of a god or of many gods. The many gods hypothesis seems more realistic than the unitary hypothesis. The universe consists of a chaotic jumble of conflicting fo rces, and so do we, although most of the beliefs of science and religion seek to assert otherwise, and impose some kind of order. The human mind plainly does not actually fu nction in the singu­lar sense that the monotheist theory of soul or the post-monotheist idea of 'self' implies.

At best we can hope to establish some sort of Neo-Pantheist democracy rather than impose a dictatorship along monotheist lines. Neo-Pantheists do not seek to erect a false singular identity for themselves; rather they seek to explore the riches of their in­ner pantheons by meditation, ritual enactment, and action in the world. Neo-Pantheist theory asserts that everyone has untapped reserves of extraordinary abilities, often you merely have to per­suade the other parts of the mind to shut up for a while to invoke them. Neo-Pantheist magicians quite frequently name their various selves, sometimes using the names of appropriate pagan gods. Such godforms, or chaomeras as we sometimes call them, can ac­tually create parapsychological and probability distorting effects in the outside world, thus our scientific selves do not regard the process as entirely deluded. The outside world only exists for us as perceptions and thoughts and feelings about them inside our own heads anyway. People who spend their energies frantically piling up worldly power and riches do so in an attempt to change their own experiences of the world within their heads. Magicians usually have more interest in dis­covering the riches already inside and they usually remain content with merely remaining materially comfortable, excess wealth and consumption brings them no kudos with their peers, only their knowledge and self mastery counts for anything there. Magical philosophy contains a strong streak of individualism and self reliance bordering on hubris, we choose what to believe and try to make it work, and we make our own gods in our own images and try to live them out. We also try to make ourselves a work of art in mind and body, an aesthetic more akin to that of the classical Greeks than that of the contemporary wage slave and consumer-punter. And thus we arrive at question B). Would the widespread adoption of the pursuit of Magic reduce humanity's current suicidal reliance on religion and excessive consumption? Most of the magicians I know have a high standard of education, they have a working knowledge of science and a profound distrust of organized religion, they either got this through social privilege or by clawing their way to it by sheer will and imagination."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"XVI So perhaps we need to consider the wider question of wbat can magic offer tbe great mass of bumanity? AT THIS POINT it seems appropriate to loosen the constraints of consensus religious and politico-economic reasoning and try for some visions of a magic based society instead. Imagine a society where neighborhoods had their own magical temples where people could come to learn and practice meditation, visualization, trance, ritual, invocation, enchantment and divina­tion, free from theological dogma, purely as mental techniques. Places where people could bring their own creations in the form of music, song, art, food, poetry, ideas, and rituals, for mutual celebration. Imagine that such activities might prove more rewarding than watching television or competing to acquire ever more consumer junk. and that it might create a different aesthetic which values people more for the quality of what they can offer rather than the quantity of what they can consume. Imagine a working week reduced to two days. In technologically sophisticated societies this should easily suffice to provide basic necessities. We could pleasurably spend the rest of the time freely exchanging our efforts and gain social kudos by amusing, enter­taining, serving, teaching and learning from each other. We do not need to commercialize and economically regulate such activities. Imagine having to foot the real hidden costs of private vehicles; they would virtually disappear in favor of public transport, and the reintroduction of walking and cycling. Coupled with the de­criminalization of public nudity, that would sort out the obesity crisis very quickly. Imagine a society where everyone had the leisure for proper ex­ercise and the resulting disappearance of the grotesque waddling blobs that now make up a sizeable proportion of the consumer population. Commercialized culture has destroyed any kind of bodily aesthetic that the Greeks would have recognized and re­placed it with anorexic role models and an overweight population, and people who would rather watch sport than do it. Imagine a wo rld where any piece of land we do not really need to use reverts to wilderness, and a world in which any proposed building deemed ghastly by general acclaim doesn't get built, we cease to practice modern architecture and the world doesn't get any uglier, for that just increases disrespect for it. l'iO"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"ESCHATON Imagine having no professional politicians.

The advice he delivers to those who would see through the transition is purely practical, his strategies include: investing in resources that will maintain value after cur­rency collapses and, above all, skills; buying land, both to farm and also to return to original use, ie. forest; the reinstitution of gift-giving and bartering; investing locally, and carrying out a con­trolled demolition of the global economI' whilst decoupling from it. He has also noted that previously marginalised groups will come into their own during this process; the rural poor (being poor takes a lot of practice!) -and by extension, the wise women, the heal­ers, the cunning men and horse whisperers, the midwives and the necromancers - whose roles were all but expunged in the pyres of reason and progress, will find their skills are increasingly sought and valued.

They are the human component of the local ecosystems, and, as such, they deserve much more respect than they have received. A lot of them can't be bothered about fine man­ners or about speaking English. Those who are used to think­ing of them as primitive, ignorant and uneducated will be shocked to discover how much they must learn from them. What interests me in this transition is the potential for magicians, occultists and pagans to engage with what is happening, to take initiative. Our strength will be found in combining our differences, l'i4"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"COUP DE FOUDRE our resources and our talents. Our diversity can become the me­dium of resistance against an (out of) control culture. The fall of the Tower is the failure of a phallic hierarchical con­struct. In its place, the possibility to initiate a rhizomatic under­ground, a web of self-sustaining, self-perpetuating autonomous cells or covens, whose praxis is rooted in their environment. If the outer form of this submerged structure is subversive by its nature, it is equally so in its inner orientation: for it removes the man-made contrivance of the Tower as its focus and aligns itself with the axis mundi. THE WITCHCRAFT OUR OWN MAGICAL WORK, as it develops, is leading us further from the mapped and colonised terrains of modern magic. When I met Peter it was a coup de fo ndre for us both; our old lives were shattered - materially and spiritually - so that we were freed to test and temper each other, to dismantle and discard what had served its purpose. What is (re)emerging from the ruins is a magic stripped bare, a practice based on altering consciousness through energy work, ordeal and psychoactive plants and drugs, ritualised and freeform. It is, in some ways, a continuation of the spirit of the last works of Jack Parsons, a return to the ropts of witchcraft. In Freedom is a Two-edged Sword his instinctive and passionate essays illuminate the first steps of a path to reconnect with the primal spirit of woman and man. A partnership of equals. Art. Change. Revolution. We are the witchcraft. We are the oldest organisation in the world. When man was first born, we were. We sang the first cradle song. We healed the first wound, we comforted the first terror. We were the Guardians against the Darkness, the Helpers on the Left Hand Side. We are on the side of man, of life and of the individual. Therefore we are against religion, morality and government. Therefore our name is Lucifer. We are on the side of freedom, of love, of joy and laughter and divine drunkenness. Therefore our name is Babalon."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"XVI On August 20th 1946 Parsons resigned from the OTO, calling it au­tocratic. Feeling that he had reached the limit of what he could learn within the Order, he needed an alternative expression for the energies and impulses that had fired his first occult explorations. His solution was to invoke the myth of the earliest manifestations of magic, there being none of the myriad opportunities available to our generation. Jack imagined witchcraft, he dreamt it. He sought it through the fault lines in consciousness, at the crossed roads of power lines, in descent to the wells of atavistic memory. And he found it in the body of a woman, of woman . ... she will come as a perilous flame and a devious song, a voice in the judgment halls, a banner before armies. She will come girt with the sword of freedom, and before her kings and priests will tremble and cities and empires will fall, and she will be called BABALON, the scarlet woman. For she will be lustful and proud; she will be subtle and deadly, she will be forthright and invincible as a naked blade.! His ceuvre is slim, but the essays in Freedom is a Two-edged Sword, show Jack to be a torchbearer for the idealistic and humanist phi­losophy that fo unded the United States: ideals, he felt, that had already been betrayed by 1950. They are being further undermined today, the Patriot Act has eclipsed the Bill of Rights, and the situa­tion is as dire in the UK. In Jack's manifestos we can trace the influence of Thelema, particularly Liber Oz, which states the rights of man. Further, we find Rabelais, whose subversive use of humour reignited in the Renaissance the bonfires of medieval popular insurgency. It is of course Rabelais' do what thou wilt which was recycled by Crowley. The influence of communism, still viewed as a devilish op­poser to capitalist interests in America, is also apparent in Jack's thought. His writing style echoes the stirring clarion call for free­dom fo und in the Communist Manifesto. But he took its idealistic vigour, rather than a straight reading of Marx's economic critique of society. Instead of embracing dialectical materialism, Jack saw the disintegration occurring in his own society ending in the indi­vidual freedom of Thelema not the collectivism of communism. He writes in the Manifesto of the Witchcraft: I r,,(' WO It/(1l1 (;irl wil\" (I Sword. frolll \"n,(,dolt/ is (I TW(J·Eawa Sword."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"COUP DE FOUDRE ... the breakup of the home and family, the confusion in the problems of morals and behaviour, the frustration of the individual need for love, self-expression and freedom, and the immanence of the destruction of western civilisation all indicate the need for a basic reexamination and alteration of individual and social values. Looking deeper we can also detect the ideas that led to the French Revolution and the fall of the ancien regime - liberte, egalite, fra­ternite. Jack, in common with Wicca and feminist aligned witch­craft, also inherited the ideas of Jacob Grimm and Jules Michelet, who recast the witch in the 19th century as a wise woman and the defender and healer of the people. The rising of a Romantic nationalist sentiment amongst the bourgeoisie cast the figure of the witch as both pre-Christian and anti-Christian. Inspired by Grimm's example, set out in Deutsche Mpthologie, Michelet saw her as a symbol of the French people. He specifically and quite fic­titiously identified her with the Revolution in his novel La Sorciere: Under such a system of blind and indiscriminate repression, to venture little, to venture much and far, is all one, and the risk the same. The very danger incurred increased the Sorcer­esses' recklessness, and led them to do and dare everything. Whilst Michelet could not be accused of historical veracity in his novel. his imaginative recovery of the witch as the guardian of the Old Religion, was rousing to those looking for an archetype to lead them over the barricades and into an egalitarian, progres­sive future. Folklore was mobilized, as the peasants and proletariat themselves could never have been. The rebellious witch may be a romantic figure born of idealism, nevertheless her hold over our imagination is real. All modern forms of witchcraft are heavily dependent on this very romanticism, on a nostalgic remember­ing which at its best is a form of Gnostic re-membering and at its worst a mawkish sentimental escapism. It is witchcraft which can destroy the Tower, turn over the social order and throw kings from the battlements. Opposed to an exter­nal coersive authority, I see witchcraft being spun from the body, the true pole around which the dance of life and death circles."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"XVI INVERSION AND REVOLTION The Black Mass and the Sabbat MICHELET EXPLICITLY UNITES woman's body with Revolution, and the return to a natural, cyclical order which she spins from her womb. He writes: That the marvellous monster of universal life was swallowed up inside her; that from now on life, death, everpthing was held within her entrails, and at the price of such painful labour, she had conceived nature. What he intuits and deploys to his own ends is the immense energy generated by her menstrual cycle: order is reversed or in­verted and the body is purged and renewed. Woman IS revolution because she is always in flux, always moving, always changing. Jack too, places Woman at the centre, and not at the edges of magick. Not a fixed, obedient centre, not the projected idealised object of male single-pointed consciousness. The suppression, demonisation and control of women under Christianity and Capitalism - its rapaciously prolific progeny -signifies the intent to domesticate people. A tamed workforce is more productive, more manageable. It was woman, as herself, and as mother, sister, wife, lover, comrade in arms, who had to be un­done in order to break the strength of man. Aiming at controlling nature, the capitalist organization of work must refuse the unpredictability implicit in the prac­tice of magic, and the possibility of establishing a privileged relation with the natural elements, as well as the belief in the existence of powers available only to particular individuals, and thus not easily generalized and exploitable ... Above all, magic seemed a form of refusal of work, of insubordination, and an instrument of grassroots resistance to power. The world had to be 'disenchanted' in order to be dominated.' It is for us all to re-enchant the world. To free ourselves. To do what we will. The role of wo men is vital in this process, and always has been. From the women burnt to fuel our enlightened consumer utopias, to the feared petroleuses of the paris Commune, to the incendiary women of 20·h century Red Armies, women have always b en more than equal in the revolutionary struggle for freedom. 2 Silvil1l\" d 'ri i , Illibllllilmi Ibe Wile/)."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"XVI The Sabbat and the Black Mass symbolise and accomplish an over­throw or a subversion of the established order. They threaten the architecture of control, as also did the Feast of Fools, the Vigil of Venus and our May Day fe stivities. Traditions such as the 'ass of Padstow, and Penglaz the 'abby 'ass of Penwith, are clearly pa­gan in origin and sensibility, they mark natural time - May day, Midsummer, Midwinter - and they are ever vital, even now as the wheel of the year is loose on its axle, because they belong to the present. penglaz, the nightmare, confronts the living with their inescapable mortality; with Her pallid indestructible skull She teases and goads us, She rides us into the ground. If May Day is both green and red, we must not forget the black masses, the celebrations of opposition, the nigrescent gatherings in the high distant places, the orgiastic feasts of the witches and the beasts. It should also be remembered that the sabbats were often a cover for the revolutionary meetings of the medieval peas­antry in conflict with their feudal overlords. Unified for a common aim, men and women enjoyed a rare equality. The reverse spectacle, the celebration, in which everyone participates, in which no-one is voyeur, is the sabbat.3 Once more we recognise the inversion and revolution inherent in Witchcraft, and exemplified by the sabbat. This is the essence of magic, the shamanic core of which demands that each celebrant, each ecstatic, each present, loses their face and speaks with the gods directly. Jack's manifesto of The Witchcraft is anti-organisation and anti­authoritarian: all organisations have known us, no organisation is of us; where there is too much organisation we depart. And Helene Cixous in her insightful and poetic elucidation of oppositions, Sorties, writes: Organization b]? hierarch]? makes all conceptual or­ganization subject to man. Witchcraft subtly evades this external control, as it eludes exo­teric definition; structure is anathema on this path which is always underfoot, which comes into being in the act of being trodden. Witchcraft is first and fo remost an art written in, by and through the woman, having a pared down beauty and restraint that needs nothing but the body and what is at hand to exist. Her body is the means and the end. Power waxes through life lived, experience, the hundred daily chores that whittle away the ego -it cannot be I \"Will /,11 /(,III1C NI!(', Catherine Clcllll'nt. 260"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"COLli' IlE rOll nil E bought or feigned. At core, witchcraft is a fluid number of tech­niques - as individual as those who develop and carry them; it is craft as power, and craft as skill. Witchcraft speaks the green language of Ve nus, her <llluring lIy­trap cunning leading us into the game, her game; and witchcraft speaks in the common tongue. Her universe is a realm of asso­nance and play, rather than number and dogma. Witchcraft is timeless precisely because it is NOW, the blindspot of history. Lunar because it is a reflection of the times we live in, and a living response to our present condition. The witch walks with a foot in both worlds, sacred and profane bound together with each footfall. Never obliged to believe in man-made truths, her eye looks beyond the shifting surfaces, day and night, life and death, into the dynamic unity: pan-Babalon, Ometeotl. Siv<l-Sakti. This is an archaic, shamanic vision of the world and the words of artist sorcerer Austin Osman Spare evoke it: This is the wisdom of the cavemen that we have lost; it was their sanity, the lack of it is our madness. We no longer know how to act, and having lost the symbol we have now lost the reality. Not by logic, nor by intellect, nor by reason can we regain it - but by wild dances, solemn rites and ch<lnts in unknown tongues.

The Ecstatic whose feet beat out rhythm against the earth. The cauled fetus whose heart pounds against the confines of its sac. Entering the circle the Sabbatic dancer is plunged into a void, the ombilic­alembic, the cauldron. Time gyrates space bends. Spirit flows into form, held momentarily and shattered. Each movement iterates a corporeal glyph spelling incantations. Wordless expression, crea­tion inseparable from destruction, a primal archaic gnosis th<lt has not yet been born. Dance allowed me to enter the world of spirits, and to move amongst them; to alchemise physical and mental exertion whilst developing focus, balance and the harnessing of the emotions. The ritual of performance, with or without an <ludience, is a potent magical act, but it is through training and daily practice that I have undergone the profoundest initiations. 4 J\\OS, qlloll'd by Kl'nnl'lh Cranl in llc('(l/t\"s n\"III/\"i\". llli"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"XVI The sacrifice and ordeal of dance as an offering, an energetic prayer by which we participate in the cycles of creation, preserva­tion and destruction, is reminiscent of the role of Siva as Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance. The body of the sacrificer or dancer is one of His eight forms and through it we partake of the entire realm of Nature which is His: water, fire, iikiisa (rethyr or quintessence), earth, air, the Sun and the Moon. The sacrificer is the sacrifice, just as the artist is one with creation. This devotion is its own reward, the benefits extend throughout the nervous system, to the aware­ness of being a body that speaks, a lucid bodJ? THE WITCH HAS LONG SUBLIMATED THE DESIGNS Of POWER. She has been born of dungeons, learnt her craft under the tutelage of in­quisitors, she took flight in strapado. All institutions of repression will incubate heresy. It does not take long to realise the society whose freedoms we enjoy is repressive, restrictive and controlling: one nation under CCTV, spy drones, and a militarised police force to quell and deter protest. One does not need to step far out of line to slam into the bars. Witchcraft is a path of resistance, the path of the survivor, as relevant now as always. Of all the fathers of modern witchcraft only Jack shared the witches' fate, his body burned to ash, his self effaced. And since Michelet resurrected this downtrodden and silenced woman as the future messiah, only Jack has so explicitly called for freedom, and addressed this cry to woman, called her Babalon, goddess of Love and War. Babylon is fallen, we are fallen, and it has fallen to us to dismantle the towers within and without. The revolutions will first be accomplished in consciousness. We can change ourselves, in a lightning flash, in ictu oculi. We have in our hands and in the land, the tools and the weapons to win our freedom. The world is our battlefield and the battle is still being fought. Let us be like the en­fa nts perdus of the Paris Commune. Those foolhardy or brave souls who flung themselves over the barricades at the behest of the god­dess Liberty. These are the voltigeurs, whom you may recall from the works of Michael Bertiaux and Kenneth Grant where they are the leapers between worlds. But rather than this batrachian image, I prefer the other meaning, of pauper princes rather than frogs. Ragged children of freedom sacrificing all for their brothers and sisters in this world - for what is this world if not the place where ALL worlds meet and collide.

Fear of change, fear of going without, fear of death, fear of the unknown ... Yet, in the unknown lies the path we must tread. Do not let ignorance, conformity and social inertia determine your course. Be unreasonable. Sometimes we move openly, sometimes in silence and in se­cret. Night and day are one to us, calm and storm, seasons and the cycles of man, all these things are one, for we are at the roots. Supplicant we stand before the Powers of Life and Death, and are heard of these powers and avail. Our way is the secret way, the unknown direction. Ours is the way of the serpent in the underbrush, our knowledge is in the eyes of goats and of women. Jack understood. The way opening to us now is the lightning path, that crooked path of current ripping through the heavens and bringing fire to earth. The witch has always been found on the threshold, in the liminal spaces. At twilight. And this is where pre­cisely we find ourselves now - driven into the margins of life. The collapse of the oil economy, environmental disaster and the cata­strophic pillaging of the world's remaining resources are plunging our present civilisation into meltdown. The monuments of our age will pass in time, of that I do not doubt. The shattered visage of this civilisation will slip and be reclaimed by Nature. We will be swallowed by the yawning Hellmouth we have created; we have consumed the Earth, so in turn we will be consumed by the Earth.
