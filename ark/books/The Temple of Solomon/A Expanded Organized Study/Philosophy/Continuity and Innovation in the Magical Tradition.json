Its seeds were sown when the three editors first began discussing the possibility of organizing a research group at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem, with an international group of scholars working on different aspects of magical texts and practices in the various cultures of the ancient and medieval world, “pagan,” Jewish, Christian and Muslim. These deliberations resulted in a full proposal, titled “Occult Powers and Officiants in Non-official Cults within Near Eastern Cultures,” which we submitted to the Institute and which was approved for a period of half a year, from March to August 2006. During this period, the group’s eight members—Tzvi Abusch, Gideon Bohak, Alexander (Sandor) Fodor, Yuval Harari, David Jordan, Reimund Leicht, Dan Levene and Shaul Shaked—met for a weekly seminar as well as on numerous informal occasions, compared notes and discussed each other’s work, all in a remarkably friendly and cooperative manner. Toward the end of this period we organized a three-day conference (July 17th–19th, 2006), focused on the theme of “Continuity and Innovation in the Magical Tradition.” In addition to the group’s regular members, eleven other scholars were invited to present their work. In choosing our partici-pants we made every effort to bring together a group of scholars who are deeply involved in the study of one or more ancient or medieval magical traditions, but are also open to communication across disci-plinary boundaries and outside their own narrow linguistic expertise. This resulted in a most interesting and stimulating encounter between experts in different ancient and medieval cultures whose subject mat-ters and research methods share much in common, as will readily be seen from the papers gathered below.While these papers deal with magical texts in numerous differ-ent languages—and none of the participants in the conference could boast a reading ability in all the languages and scripts covered by the other participants—they often employ the same analytic techniques"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2 gideon bohak, yuval harari and shaul shakedand encounter similar textual, ritual and cultural phenomena. Thus, our emphasis in the present volume is not so much on the contact between different magical traditions (although this issue comes up in some of the papers) as on the recurrence of similar phenomena in magical texts as far apart as the Akkadian cuneiform tablets and an Arabic manuscript bought in Egypt in the late-twentieth century. Such similarities demonstrate to what extent many different cultures share a “magical logic” which is strikingly identical, and in particular they show the recurrence of certain phenomena when magical practices are transmitted in written form and often preserve, adopt and adapt much older textual units.This brings us to one central theme of the present volume. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the magical traditions covered in the following papers is their scribal nature; rather than being “old wives’ tales” (as such materials used to be referred to dismissively in the past), the magical materials covered here were the purview of scribes and scholars, or, at the very least, of literate individuals who received much of their detailed knowledge in written form or memorized large chunks of text and then reproduced it orally or in writing. These practitioners copied, edited, revised and used their textual sources, transmitted them to their colleagues and disciples, and in some cases composed entirely new texts, often made up of older textual materi-als. Thus, they may be seen not only as active magicians, serving their clients, being paid for their services and being encouraged, tolerated or persecuted by the religious and secular authorities, but also as men (possibly also as women) of letters, whose scribal and editorial activi-ties are intertwined with their magical ones, since it is these activities which form the basis of their special knowledge. Most of the papers in the present volume deal with one aspect or another of the complex interplay between continuous transmission, sometimes over remark-ably long periods of time, and innovation, gradual or abrupt, as well as transformation, borrowing and adaptation of magical knowledge in different periods and places from ancient Mesopotamia to the Middle Ages and beyond.Another feature of the scribal character of the magical technology is the growing emphasis over a period of time on specialization and on the distinction between different branches of knowledge. Thus, one feature of ancient and medieval magic is a growing demarcation of different fields of knowledge and action, often with different special-ists, technologies and terminologies for each of these specific fields. Thus, one more major theme covered by the papers below is that of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" continuity and innovation in the magical tradition 3the separation, or overlaps, between magic and divination, magic and medicine, magic and astrology and magic and mysticism in different societies in Antiquity. While these relations are differently reconfig-ured in each culture and society, the very emergence of these distinc-tions and overlaps seems common to all the cultures covered by the present volume, and is in part the result of the growth of highly com-plex bodies of magical and related knowledge.The focus on processes of continuity and innovation, and on the delimitation of the magicians’ specific expertise, is bound to yield some surprising results. Thus, to give just one example, magicians often boast of the hoary Antiquity of some of their recipes and rituals, and even attribute them to sages of old, like Solomon or Zoroaster. Yet most practitioners of the magic arts were ill-equipped to assess the real age of the textual materials they handled, and did not really care how old these materials were, as long as they were deemed ancient enough to be exceedingly potent. The academic scholar, on the other hand, often approaches these texts with a deep seated hermeneutics of sus-picion, virtually taking for granted that neither Solomon nor Zoroaster had anything to do with their composition or dissemination. However, the same scholar is forced to admit that some of the magicians’ textual materials (though not necessarily those deemed to be ancient by the magicians themselves) are in fact extremely old, and in some cases the scholar can even reconstruct their origins and development with some precision. The scholar is also sensitive to the relations between the magicians’ productions and actions and those of some of their contemporaries in related fields, and is always looking for such con-nections and the clues they provide with regard to the identity of the anonymous practitioners, their social standing, and the breadth and depth of their knowledge outside the field of magic. Modern scholars are in fact looking over the shoulders of the ancient magicians and muttering, “Look, this is an edition of a much older recipe . . . but this piece is newly made up . . . and this bit is borrowed from another culture or translated from another language . . . and here the author is slipping into the realms of divination, or showing off with some medical ter-minology . . . and there the style is that of a mystic of the same period, with a somewhat different twist.” Such mutterings, though couched in a more scientific language and supported by the necessary philological apparatus, form the backbone of the following studies.To highlight the diversity of the present volume, and the common threads that run through the papers, which are arranged in a rough chronological order, beginning with Mesopotamia and Egypt and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"4 gideon bohak, yuval harari and shaul shakedending in the Middle Ages, let us briefly summarize the contents of each paper.In the first essay, Tzvi Abusch uncovers the textual and redac-tional history of some of the elaborate incantations of the Maqlû anti-witchcraft rituals from ancient Mesopotamia. Focusing on two spe-cific incantations, he shows that the repetitions and inconsistencies they display are best explained as resulting from a gradual process of textual expansions and interpolations of older and shorter spells. Such processes are also evident when different tablets with the same incan-tations are compared, as they too display variants which are due not to scribal errors but to conscious editorial activities. Thus, the later texts are made up of numerous primary and secondary units, with the latter sometimes inserted into the former and sometimes between them, and with recurrent repetitions and resumptions which reveal the original shape of the units. As we shall see, an analysis of the Babylonian incan-tation bowls of more than a millennium later reveals a surprisingly similar picture.Turning from Mesopotamia to Egypt, Joachim Friedrich Quack searches for the Egyptian precedents for the charitesion, the magical procedure which seeks to give charm and grace to a specific individual, a procedure which is well attested in the Greek magical papyri and related texts. Quack traces the use of the Egyptian words for “favor” and for “love” from the second millennium BCE to the Roman period, and especially the numerous occurrences, both in non-magical texts and in some hymns and spells, of the notion of finding favor with the gods and with the king and thus acquiring protection from one’s ene-mies as well as personal success. By this analysis Quack can show that many of the elements of the Greek charitesion are already attested in pre-Hellenistic Egyptian culture. He then turns to a detailed examina-tion of the Demotic and Greek charitesia, showing that some of their salient features may be Egyptian in origin, and offering some impor-tant guidelines for anyone who seeks to define the cultural origins of a specific magical text or practice.Still in Roman Egypt, where Quack ends his survey, Jacco Diele-man focuses on the Greek, and especially the Demotic, magical papyri. His starting point is the fact that the Greek magical papyri display much Egyptian influence, but are certainly not Greek translations of earlier Egyptian documents. He also notes that the Demotic magical papyri are written in a language and script which were only acces-sible to Egyptian priests but are certainly not copies of copies of"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" continuity and innovation in the magical tradition 5older Egyptian priestly texts. By surveying the different forms and genres of Egyptian magical recipes and recipe-books from Pharaonic to Roman Egypt, Dieleman can show both the continuity of some forms and the emergence in the Demotic magical papyri of recipe-types and magical practices which did not exist in pre-Hellenistic Egyptian medicine and magic. Thus, he concludes that the Demotic magical papyri were produced by Egyptian scribes who had access to older Egyptian temple libraries, but were in no way confined to using what they found there, as they also had access to some more recent magical technologies, and may even have developed some of these technologies themselves.From the Egyptian temples of the Roman period we turn to the contemporaneous developments in the Greek-speaking world. First, Fritz Graf provides a detailed analysis of two very different sources, an inscription from Ephesus and a passage from Porphyry’s philo-sophical writings. These illustrate the complex relations between magic and divination in Late Antiquity. In the first example, an Apolline oracle identifies a plague as brought about by witchcraft, and offers a Maqlû-type description of how this sorcery will be dissolved if the citizens carry out the prescribed rituals, but does not try to identify the culprit(s) who perpetrated the magical attack. In the second case, the same god suggests the use of magical rites to free a specific person from the demons that were binding him down to his material nature and to enable him to achieve contact with the divine. Thus, Graf sug-gests, “magic” could be seen in one context as the source of an evil plague and in another as a tool to be used for noble beneficial aims, and both views can be documented in earlier Greek texts as well. In both contexts, moreover, “magic” and “divination” were not seen as overlapping activities. This would change with the triumph of Christi-anity, which saw the pagan oracles as demonic in nature and equated divination with magic.The second paper to deal with the Greek-speaking half of the Roman Empire is by Christopher Faraone, and it too seeks to illus-trate the relations between magic and a related field of knowledge, medicine, with the help of two very different examples. The first is the notion, which was shared by magicians and doctors alike, that the womb often moves within a woman’s body and thus generates various gynecological disorders which were interpreted as “uterine suffoca-tion.” Here we can see that some of the magicians were kept abreast of the medical knowledge and terminology of their time, including their"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"6 gideon bohak, yuval harari and shaul shakedassumptions about the shape of the uterus, often depicted on uterine amulets. A similar picture emerges from Faraone’s second example, an amuletic gemstone with an elaborate inscription whose contents display remarkable similarities with the structure of the popular medi-cal handbooks of the time. Thus, rather than seeing Greek and Roman doctors as learned scientists, set apart from the ignorant magicians on the margins of their society, Faraone develops a view of physicians and magicians as deriving from the same social circles and sharing some of their knowledge and terminology.Turning from Greeks and Romans to Jews, Ithamar Gruenwald uses the insights gained from recent studies of ritual to analyze the place of magico-theurgical practices in the corpus of ancient Jewish mystical texts known as the Hekhalot literature and in ancient Jewish magic. First, he stresses that the aim of such practices is the transformation of reality or of the practitioner who uses them, thus creating a unique world governed by their own ritual theory. Then, by analyzing one specific example from Sefer Ha-Razim, the Hebrew “Book of Myster-ies,” probably written in Byzantine Palestine, Gruenwald exposes the internal ritual logic of an extremely detailed magical recipe whose aim is “to speak with the moon or with the stars about any matter,” and especially matters of love. Rather than being a hodgepodge of strange practices and “superstitions” (yet another term used by past scholars to dismiss such materials), the ritual turns out to be consistent with its own assumptions and presuppositions, and quite in line with what we find in other magical traditions.With the next paper we move from the late-Roman Empire back to Babylonia, but more than a full millennium after the period cov-ered by Abusch’s paper. Looking at the Jewish incantation bowls of the Sasanian period, Shaul Shaked focuses on three bowls which were produced for a single client by three different scribes, and show a great degree of textual overlap. By looking at these bowls synoptically, and analyzing their similarities and differences, Shaked shows how a single textual unit could be used in different ways by different scribes, how different textual units served different functions within the bowl-texts, and how some smaller units served as bridges between the larger textual units, which the scribes then mixed and matched according to the specific circumstances. Among the factors that seem to have influenced the layout of the bowl texts, mention may be made of the physical size of the bowl, or the names of the client or clients who"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" continuity and innovation in the magical tradition 7commissioned them. Thus, while it is not always clear whether these practitioners used written books of magical spells, as we know the Jews of Byzantine Palestine did, it is quite clear that they had access both to oral prototypes and to actual bowls, and used these sources when producing their own bowls.Dan Levene’s paper is also devoted to the Babylonian-Jewish incan-tation bowls, but here the emphasis is on one specific sub-genre of bowls, those which identify themselves as a qybl’, a kind of counter-spell intended to return aggressive magical actions upon their perpetra-tors. Like Shaked, Levene too points to the similarities and differences between the texts on “parallel” bowls, but his main interest lies in the relations between the qybl’ texts and the bowls on which they were written, which were apparently often bound together in pairs, one bowl facing the other, tied with cords and sealed with bitumen. The effect of this arrangement was to create a dark space between the bowls, symbolizing the spells’ “counteractive” nature. This observation opens the way for the identification of more bowls that display the remains of the bitumen used to seal them, and an analysis of their texts reveals some similarities with the qybl’ bowls, including the frequent recur-rence of the Yaror demons. Such similarities between the texts of the spells and the manipulations exercised on the objects on which they were written, once again indicate the complex ways in which magical know-how was transmitted and used among the bowl-producers of late-antique Mesopotamia.From Jewish magic we turn to the Jewish interest in astrology. Kocku von Stuckrad begins his essay with a survey of the biases and misleading categories that still plague the study of ancient astrology, and turns to a detailed analysis of the numerous astrological elements in the Testament of Solomon, and especially the attempt to control dif-ferent cosmic powers. He then focuses on the veneration of planets, especially of the Sun, evident in the above-mentioned Sefer Ha-Razim, and notes how this practice, which is supposed to be forbidden by Jewish law, is amply paralleled in the Greek magical papyri. Finally, an analysis of the ascents to heaven described and prescribed in the Jewish mystical texts known as the Hekhalot literature illustrates yet another facet of the Jewish infatuation with the heavens and their con-tents in Late Antiquity. Such examples, von Stuckrad argues, prove that the neat borderlines scholars used to envision between magic and astrology, or between “Jewish” and “Christian” texts and practices, are"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"8 gideon bohak, yuval harari and shaul shakedmostly artificial. While some ancient Jews kept such fields of knowl-edge as astrology at arm’s length, others adopted it with zeal even if it contravened some of their forefathers’ religious regulations.Still focusing on astrology and on its Jewish practitioners, Reimund Leicht takes us in a somewhat different direction, by tracing the grad-ual development of the Jewish interest in astrology, and especially the planets. He begins his paper by noting that both in the biblical corpus and in the Jewish literature of the Second Temple period, there is little evidence of Jewish interest in astrology, and no evidence of Jewish familiarity with planetary astronomy or astrology. He then moves on to rabbinic literature, which shows that toward the end of the second century CE, or the beginning of the third, the rabbis’ interest in the luni-solar calendar made them study which days and hours are gov-erned by which planets. This included the acceptance and adaptation of some astrological predictions relating, for example, to the fate and character of seasons which begin, or persons who are born, under the influence of a certain planet. This important shift in the Jewish view of astrology also paved the way for a whole host of later Jewish astro-logical texts, and in fact marks the birth of what may be seen as the “Jewish” branch of ancient and medieval astrology.With Yuval Harari’s paper we move from astrology to divination through dream inquiries, a common practice among Jews and non-Jews alike. The paper offers a detailed survey of the uses of dreams in ancient societies, and especially in the Jewish world, from the Hebrew Bible to the Middle Ages, followed by a brief survey of late antique and medieval Jewish magical practices for gaining material success. At the intersection of the manipulation of dreams and the desire for finan-cial success, Harari locates the highly specific phenomenon of dream inquiries intended to find out the location of a hidden treasure. He then re-edits one such dream request found in the Cairo Genizah, first published a long time ago, but misunderstood by its original editors. In his discussion Harari tries to reconstruct the possible circumstances surrounding the production of this text.From Genizah dream requests we turn to Genizah rotuli—that is, to long and narrow vertical parchment scrolls which were in use in early Genizah times for various purposes, including the writing of magical recipe books. Surveying the extant fragments of three such rotuli, and focusing on the one which is both the oldest and the best preserved, Gideon Bohak assesses the importance of this unnoticed stage in the transmission of Jewish magical literature. As the magical recipes on"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" continuity and innovation in the magical tradition 9this rotulus are all aggressive in nature, and can be shown to have orig-inated in late-antique Palestine, they provide an unusually revealing perspective on some aggressive magical aims. They also demonstrate some unorthodox magical technologies used at least by some Jews in the pre-Muslim period. These texts were still being transmitted as late as the ninth and tenth centuries. As most of these recipes seem to have gone out of circulation in the later periods, Bohak suggests that they might have been seen as excessively violent in the eyes of the Jewish public in the medieval period.Last but not least, Alexander Fodor examines a modern magical manuscript bought in Egypt in 1973, which includes, inter alia, an Arabic version of the Sword of Moses, a Jewish book of magic writ-ten in Aramaic and Hebrew some time in the first millennium CE. Through a detailed analysis of some of the recipes provided by the Arabic text and their constant comparison with the previously-known versions of the Sword, Fodor shows that the Arabic version restruc-tures the original text in order to fit it into a wider textual framework. The Arabic version strips away much of the specifically Jewish fla-vor of the original text, and adds some unmistakably Egyptian-Arabic elements to the resulting text. This analysis provides an interesting indication of the cultural context of at least one of the redactors of the Arabic text, who may have been a Coptic Christian. The recurrent influence of Jewish liturgical formulae and Hekhalot-related materials on the magical procedures presented by the Arabic text shows that its textual forerunners must have undergone some editorial revisions by Jewish editors long before being translated into Arabic. Thus, a single Arabic manuscript bears witness to a whole millennium of continuity, innovation, translation and adaptation in two or three different magi-cal traditions.These are the main contours of the papers gathered below. We tried, as editors, to exercise a light touch, and to let the scholars follow their own mode of academic writing in matters of article length, density of footnotes, and depth of philological or historical analysis. Thus, some of the papers included in the present volume include some notes and discussions whose full merits and implications we cannot judge, as we lack the specific linguistic and historical expertise. Yet we remain con-vinced that the study of ancient and medieval magical texts, with their unique styles, complex terminologies and varying states of preserva-tion, can only be fruitful and worthwhile when carried out by compe-tent scholars who patiently read and re-read their sources and dissect"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"10 gideon bohak, yuval harari and shaul shakedthem with the finest philological tools. We are at the same time convinced that for such studies to be useful to scholars beyond the narrow fields of Akkadian, Egyptian, Greco-Roman, Jewish or Islamic Studies, they must use the minute philological analysis to support wider-ranging arguments, and especially to highlight textual, historical and phenomenological pro-cesses which might be valid in other cultures as well. In the present vol-ume, we have tried to bring together a whole set of such papers, each of which should prove important for scholars in its specific discipline and useful for students dealing with magic of other times and places.Finally, it is a duty and a pleasure to thank all the bodies and institu-tions that made this volume possible. First and foremost, the Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem and its director, Professor Eliezer Rabi-novici, hosted us for six months in a most gracious and scholarly envi-ronment, and thus made the entire project feasible and delightful. The Institute's associate director at the time, Pnina Feldman, with the mem-bers of the administrative staff, Shani Freiman and Dalia Avieli, made every effort to assure the success and well-being of the group, including the conference whose results we publish here. Throughout this period, Naama Vilozny served as the group's research assistant, and helped the group and each of its members, in a most devoted and pleasant way; she was replaced for part of the time by Shahar Shirtz, a very competent and knowledgeable helper. The conference itself was funded both by the Insti-tute for Advanced Studies and by The Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. We are grateful to both institutions for their support.Professors Guy G. Stroumsa and David Shulman have kindly accepted our volume for this series, Jerusalem Studies in Religion and Culture, which seemed like the obvious venue for a book on magic conceived and nourished in Jerusalem. The book itself was meticu-lously edited by Esther Rosenfeld, who went over each paper with a keen eye and endless patience. Ortal-Paz Saar proofread the entire manuscript, and prepared the Index. We are grateful to both of them for making this a much better book than it would otherwise have been. And, last but not least, our Brill editors, Maarten Frieswijk and Marjo-lein Schaake, have made every effort to ensure a smooth, professional and extremely friendly production process. Without the joint efforts of all these \"invisible hands,\" the present book, with all its linguistic and typographical complexities, would never have been completed. Two of the editors of the present volume should like to acknowl-edge with sincere gratitude the extra effort undertaken by their friend Gidi Bohak, who performed the major part of the editorial chores. It is our joint hope that the end result will be found to be a useful and worthwhile contribution to the study of magic."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE REVISION OF BABYLONIAN ANTI-WITCHCRAFT INCANTATIONS: THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF INCANTATIONS IN THE CEREMONIAL SERIES MAQLÛ*Tzvi AbuschIntroductionIn this paper, I shall try to shed some further light on modes of revi-sion of Akkadian incantations. Individual incantations were not static and often took on more than one form. We know of the existence of these forms through several means. Sometimes, we actually have extant variant forms of an incantation that are similar enough to indi-cate a genetic relationship but sufficiently different to suggest that they had separate identities.1 In other instances, internal tensions or incon-sistencies in a text suggest that the preserved text was produced by the revision of an earlier version. In the latter instance, we establish the existence of different forms of the text by means of a critical analysis that focuses primarily upon the aforementioned internal tensions or inconsistencies.Elsewhere, I have compared extant forms of individual incantations (and expect to do so again).2 Here, I shall discuss some results obtained through critical analysis of incantations in the Akkadian magical series Maqlû, “Burning.” This series is the longest and most important Meso-potamian composition concerned with combating witchcraft; its text served as the script of a ceremonial performance. Maqlû contains a * This paper was first drafted while I was a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, during the spring and summer of 2006. I am grateful to the institute and its staff for their support and hospitality, to the other members of the research group “Occult Powers and Officiants in Near Eastern Cultures” for their collegiality, and to Brandeis University for supplementary support. Versions of this paper were read at the institute’s conference “Continuity and Innova-tion in the Magical Tradition,” Jerusalem, July 2006, as well as at the 217th meeting of the American Oriental Society, San Antonio, 2007.1 In some instances, we must try to determine whether the differences are no more than performance or aesthetic variants.2 See, e.g., my Babylonian Witchcraft Literature: Case Studies, BJS 132, (Atlanta, 1987 [a revised version of my 1972 Harvard dissertation]), pp. 9–44 (see below)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"12   tzvi   abuschritual tablet and eight incantation tablets that record the text of almost one hundred incantations directed against witches and witchcraft. The present form of the text seems to be a creation of the early first mil-lennium BCE, the standard long text having developed from an earlier short form by means of a series of sequential changes. A critical exam-ination of many of the incantations in Maqlû (as in other Mesopota-mian series, collections, and shorter rituals) would produce interesting literary and/or textual results, but those on which we focus our atten-tion here were re-studied recently because of problems encountered during the latest stage of editing and translating the series.3 In the course of this recent work, a number of incantations were subjected anew to critical analysis; this close and detailed study led to some new results as well as to the confirmation of some earlier impressions.I shall present here only a few of these results. I shall discuss two incantations that may be said to have undergone expansion. These incantations contain interpolations that enumerate evil forces or destructive actions associated with the witch. These interpolations are in the form of lists, and their inclusion is marked off by repetitive resumptions.4The reconstruction of stages of development of an incantation through critical analysis starts from the premise that an incantation should and will normally exhibit a coherence of thought and congru-ence between its parts. Such qualities are to be expected of relatively short literary works produced by a single composer. But sometimes a single incantation contains multiple motifs, sections, or just lines that are not wholly congruent, that are repetitive and/or awkward, that may even be contradictory, or that are at home in different incantation types or compositions. The mixture of non-congruent materials should usually be understood as a consequence of development or alteration.5 3 Whereas in previous studies, I followed the line division and count in the edi-tion of Maqlû by G. Meier, Die assyrische Beschwörungssammlung Maqlû, AfO Beiheft 2 (Berlin, 1937), and “Studien zur Beschwörungssammlung Maqlû,” AfO 21 (1966): 71–81, in this study I follow the line count of my own forthcoming edition; this new line count has now been used also in T. Abusch and D. Schwemer, “Das Abwehr-zauberritual Maqlû (‘Verbrennung’),” in B. Janowski and G. Wilhelm, (eds.), Omina, Orakel, Rituale und Beschwörungen, Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments, Neue Folge 4 (Gütersloh, 2008), pp. 128–186.4 For an alternative hypothesis regarding the formation of these incantations, see the final paragraphs of this paper.5 See my “Water into Fire: The Formation of Some Witchcraft Incantations,” Meso-potamian Witchcraft: Towards a History and Understanding of Babylonian Witchcraft Beliefs and Literature, AMD 5 (Leiden, 2002), pp. 197–198."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" revision of babylonian anti-witchcraft incantations 13While it is true that the incongruity of parts in an incantation may be due to the utilization of frozen traditional blocks or segments in the initial formation of the incantation, this incongruity is more often due to the revision of an already existing incantation. The revision may be part of a general tendency or development, or it may be no more than an idiosyncratic creation.The revision of an incantation and incorporation therein of new materials (and the creation thereby of incongruence) are due to such factors as: the adaptation of a text for a new purpose; the correlation of an incantation with a new or added ritual action; the integration of a simple text into a new, more complex, and larger ideological and/or ritual framework; the adaptation of a text to new religious beliefs or cognitive/intellectual norms. In more general terms, one may say that often the change of a text will reflect a change of ideas, a change of purpose, and/or a change of ritual usage. Overall, these changes are functions of developments in the areas of religious thought and liter-ary norms.Over the years I have identified many relatively simple examples of change, changes that are easily comprehendible because the revision involved no more than the insertion of a line or two.6 But the two Maqlû incantations here considered, Tablet II 19–75 and Tablet IV 1–79, will be seen to contain expansions and interpolations of signifi-cant length. In these instances, change seems to have produced a com-plex text; however, because the insertions are relatively long and in list form, the revisions are often more easily identifiable than some other revisions that are also extensive but more subtle. Moreover, in these incantations, the interpolations are marked off by a repetitive resump-tion, a device often referred to by the technical term Wiederaufnahme. This term refers to the fact that when a digression of a thematic or generic nature had sundered connections in a text, a redactor might repeat in identical or similar words lines of the text that preceded the break created by the interpolation.7 A Wiederaufnahme is a particularly 6 See, e.g., “Water into Fire,” pp. 198–199.7 See, e.g., M. Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel (Oxford, 1985), pp. 84–86 (note particularly the references in p. 85, n. 19) as well as A. Rofé, The Prophetical Stories (Jerusalem, 1988), p. 63, n. 13. But note that a Wiederaufnahme may also be an authorial feature “when an inclusio is involved. The latter is mani-festly a stylistic device which frames a text and marks its own integrity: it does not mark off another literary unit” (Fishbane, p. 86). It is also a narrative-strategic device (see, e.g., M. Sternberg, The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading [Bloomington, 1985], p. 414). See also J. H.

For when we examine the manuscripts of incantations that contain lists or enumerations, we occasionally find that some of the manuscripts do not contain the list or contain shorter versions thereof. Three examples suffice to illustrate this point: Maqlû III 1–30, V 26–35, and VII 114–140. It should be noted that like the incantations studied in this essay, the expansions in Maqlû III 1–30 and V 26–35 are also set off by a Wiederaufnahme.The first half of Maqlû III 1–30 describes the actions of a witch. SpBTU 3, 74a, a Babylonian manuscript from Uruk, omits lines 8–14. By itself, this omission might be explained as a haplography, but it is more likely that the Uruk manuscript represents an early form of the text. The theme of lines 8–13 is incongruous with that of the surround-ing lines. For while those lines describe the witch’s attack upon the commercial life by means of her spittle, lines 8–13 describe the witch’s attack upon the sexuality of the young people of the town by means of her glance. Line 14, moreover, repeats three of the four words found in line 7. Given the thematic incongruity between the two sections and the repetition of line 7 in line 14, the omission of lines 8–14 in SpBTU 3, 74a attests to the fact that lines 8–13 were a later insertion and that line 14 was then added as a Wiederaufnahme for the purpose of recon-necting parts of the text that were sundered by the insertion, thereby resuming the commercial description of the original text.8The incantation Maqlû V 19–47 contains (in lines 26–35) a list of destructive actions that are wished upon the witch and her witchcraft; Pentateuchal Narratives,” in J. H. Tigay, (ed.), Empirical Models for Biblical Criticism (Philadelphia, 1985), pp. 48–49 and idem, “Conflation as a Redactional Technique,” ibid., pp. 69, 74, and n. 46 for Wiederaufnahme as an editorial device; and idem, “Conflation,” p. 74, n. 46 for Wiederaufnahme as an authorial device.8 For a detailed presentation of this argument, see my “Maqlû III 1–30: Internal Analysis and Manuscript Evidence for the Revision of an Incantation,” in M. Luukko, et al., (eds.), Of God(s), Trees, Kings, and Scholars: Neo-Assyrian and Related Studies in Honour of Simo Parpola, Studia Orientalia 106 (Helsinki, 2009), pp. 307–313."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" revision of babylonian anti-witchcraft incantations 15each verbal action is compared to a plant because the verb is similar to the name of the plant and forms a word play. For example, line 32: kīma ḫašê liḫaššûši kišpūša, “Like a cress plant may her witchcraft pierce her.” This section is absent in the fragment K 18618, which probably is part of the Babylonian manuscript K 2436 + K 6006 (+) K 5349 + K10161 (+) K 18618 (+) Sm 388 (+) Sm 741 + 2069.9 And we note that in the texts in which it appears, this section is set off by a Wiederaufnahme, for both it and the following section begin (lines 26 and 36) with the address epištī u muštēpištī, “my sorceress and the woman who instigates sorcery against me.” That the absence of lines 26–35 in the Babylonian manuscript is not simply due to haplography is evident from the fact that in the expanded text this section disturbs the development of a theme based upon forms of the word nabalkutu, “to turn against” (19–25 [see 21], 36ff. [see 37–39]).An example even more similar to those studied in this paper is pro-vided by the expansion of Maqlû VII 114–140. Already in a paper presented to the American Oriental Society in 1970 and worked out in greater detail in my 1972 dissertation,10 I argued that this Maqlû incantation was created by the insertion of a lengthy list of evils into a base incantation like K 7594: 1’–8’ (//KAR 165, rev. 1’–4’)—thus VII 118–129 (as well as some lines following the central ritual in line 130) were an expansion. At the time, I imagined that the development took place prior to the incorporation of the incantation in Maqlû, an opinion that seemed reasonable in view of the length of the inser-tion. What I could not know then was that K 7594 was actually part of Maqlû. Recently, J. Fincke joined this Babylonian fragment to a Babylonian manuscript that I had pieced together over many years (K 5350 + 5374 + 7594 + 7610 + 7476 + 7631 + 8882 + 9635 + 11567 + 19154 + Sm 798b).11 Accordingly, the development must have taken 9 I am indebted to Daniel Schwemer for the knowledge of K 18618; he noticed that this fragment supported the argument presented in this paper and communicated it to me.10 See Abusch, Babylonian Witchcraft Literature, pp. 13–44. I there referred to this incantation as VII 119–146 in accordance with Meier’s line count.11 Even without K 7594, this manuscript presented such a deviant and problematic text that I questioned one of the joins and was even tempted in summer 1994 to break it in order to have it retested; I was only prevented from doing so when an additional join that I made that same summer indicated that my earlier reconstruction had to be right."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"16   tzvi   abuschplace not before the composition of Maqlû but in the course of its transmission.12I am not unaware that the shorter/earlier manuscript in each of the three cases just cited is Babylonian—this is almost certainly significant.AnalysisI now turn to the analysis of Maqlû II 19–75 (A) and IV 1–79 (B).13A.

Keep me well, that I may declare your great deeds and sing your praises.Maqlû II 19–75 is a rather long incantation. It begins with a hymnic invocation of the fire god Girra, followed by a statement that the vic-tim is turning to this god for judgment and is taking hold of the fringe of his garment as well as the fringes of other gods related to the victim (19–30). Then, in lines 31–69, the speaker describes what the witches have done to him. This is a rather long description and is actually made up of several lists: First, the speaker states that the witch has attacked and seized various parts of his body (32–36). He then proclaims that now, in the presence of the fire god, he is presenting two crisscrossed figurines of bronze (37–38). These figurines are designated as repre-senting the witch; here follows a long list of names of different kinds of witches (39–50), each pair introduced by the determinative-relative pronoun ša, “of ” (e.g., ša kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya, “of my warlock and my witch”). The list culminates in a one-line general description (line 51) of the harm to which the witches have subjected the victim: “who have given me over to a dead man, who have made me experience hardship.” Lines 52–66 form a long list of demons and illnesses that likewise culminates in a description (lines 67–69) of how evil forces have seized and held on to the victim night and day. In lines 70–71, the speaker again says that he is performing the ritual act in the pres-ence of the divinity, and here he states that he is burning the figurines in sulfur. In lines 72–73, he then asks for divine assistance—namely, that his lord look upon him and extirpate the evils (lit. “them”) from his body and release their evil witchcraft. The text ends in lines 74–75 with a final invocation and promise of praise.The text presents a number of structural and logical difficulties. The very length of the combined lists is problematic. More specifically, the following questions are among those that need to be answered: What is the function of lines 32–36, the section that describes how the witch has seized her victim? What relationship obtains between the list of witches and the act described in line 51? What relationship obtains between the list of demons and the preceding witchcraft sec-tion, generally, and line 51, specifically? What is the relationship of the list of demons to the description of activities in lines 67–69? Clearly, the most notable difficulties are those caused by the list of demons and illnesses (lines 52–66). These difficulties are of both a syntactic and a conceptual nature. The syntactic difficulty is due to the fact that the list"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" revision of babylonian anti-witchcraft incantations 19seems disconnected from its surrounding context and forms a paren-thesis. The conceptual difficulty is occasioned by the very existence of a list of demons and illnesses (lines 52–66) here in a witchcraft ritual, for witches and demons are of different natures, the former human, the latter supernatural, and the absence of a clear syntactic connec-tion means that the text does not state clearly what their relationship might be.It is a priori probable that an oral rite containing several lists—particularly lists that disrupt the logical flow of the text—has under-gone significant expansion and revision and that one or more of the lists were inserted secondarily into the incantation. This seems to be confirmed by the existence in lines 37–39 and 70–71 of a structuring Wiederaufnahme (repetitive resumption) surrounding the lists in lines 40–69:enenna ina maḫar ilūtika rabīti (37)šina ṣalmī siparri etgurūti (38)(ša kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya) (39)enenna ina maḫar ilūtika rabīti (70)ina kibrīti elleti aqallīšunūti ašarrapšunūti (71)Now, in the presence of your great divinity,Two crisscrossed bronze figurines(of my warlock and my witch) . . .Now, in the presence of your great divinity,In pure sulfur, I am burning them, I am scorching them.The existence of long lists and of a Wiederaufnahme indicates that the long central part of the text is made up of secondary elements. But let us first study the Wiederaufnahme and see its implications, leaving for later an examination of the lists. The Wiederaufnahme is realized by the repetition of line 37 as line 70. The inclusion of lists in lines 39–69 caused line 71 to be separated from lines 37–38—that is, the lists resulted in the separation of parts of a ritual statement from each other. Such a statement would have read:37. enenna ina maḫar ilūtika rabīti38. šina ṣalmī siparri etgurūti39. ša kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya71. ina kibrīti elleti aqallīšunūti ašarrapšunūti.37. Now, in the presence of your great divinity,38. Two crisscrossed bronze figurines39. Of my warlock and my witch71. In pure sulfur, I am burning (them), I am scorching (them)."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"20   tzvi   abuschThe text of II 77–103, the very next incantation in Tablet II, follows a ritual sequence comparable to the one just reconstructed for our incantation:enenna ina maḫar ilūtika rabītišina ṣalmī kaššāpi u kaššāpti ša siparri ēpuš qātukkamaḫarka uggiršunūtima kâša apqidka (II 91–93)Now, in the presence of your great divinity,By your power I have fashioned two bronze figurines of the warlock and witch,In your presence I cross them, and to you I give them.This later incantation is also to the fire god. It thus supports the contention that lines 37–38 (and very likely line 39: ša kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya, “of my warlock and my witch” [but see below]) and line 71 belong together, and that such a ritual statement constituted the original kernel of the text of II 19–75.Thus, originally, the statement “now in the presence of your great divinity, two crisscrossed bronze figurines of my warlock and witch” would have been followed immediately by the description of rit-ual activity presently found in line 71: “In pure sulfur, I am burn-ing (them), I am scorching (them).” But the insertion of various lists between lines 39 and 71 would have broken the connection (perhaps even splitting off the first part of the sentence [38–39] from its closing [71] and leaving the objects in 38–39 (šina ṣalmī siparri etgurūti . . ., “two crisscrossed bronze figurines . . .”) disconnected from the verbs that governed them (aqallīšunūti ašarrapšunūti, “I am burning them, I am scorching them”)), and the redactor would have felt the need to recreate the connection. For this reason, line 37 is repeated as line 70; this Wiederaufnahme refocuses the speech on the ritual and thus reconnects elements of the ritual that had been sundered by the major digressions.It should be noted that a non-canonical or variant form of the incantation supports this analysis. In place of the form of line 38 of the canonical text, KAR 240 reads: šina ṣalmī siparri etgurūti ušēpiš, “Two crisscrossed bronze figurines of the warlock and witch I have had fash-ioned.” This version has ušēpiš, “I have had fashioned,” where the stan-dard text has nothing. Regardless of whether we consider ušēpiš to be original or an addition, the reading ušēpiš supports the argument that the incantation has experienced a major interpolation that disrupted the incantation and split up the description of the ritual: Either ušēpiš"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" revision of babylonian anti-witchcraft incantations 21is secondary and was added in order to provide a verb to a statement that no longer had one, or it is original and the verb in line 38 was dropped so that as the present introduction of a long list of witches, line 38 might have the proper form of a header rather than serve as a verbal expression or description of the ritual.15Having seen that the text has experienced major expansion and structural modification by means of interpolations, we should now turn our attention to the lists themselves. Let us deal with them in order.Immediately prior to the description of the ritual, a list (lines 32–36) describes how the witch has seized the various parts of the victim’s body. In addresses to gods, the description of the evils that the witch has done against the speaker usually precedes the statement of the ritual act that he is undertaking against the witch. Thus if, for example, we look again to the incantation that follows ours in Tablet II (an incantation which, as we have seen, evinces similarities to the incanta-tion under study), we find that the speaker in lines 87–89 recites the foul deeds of the witch immediately prior to his ritual statement in the previously quoted lines 91–93:I have been attacked by witchcraft, and so I stand before you,I have been cursed in the presence of god, king and lord, and so I come toward you,I have been made sickening in the sight of anyone who beholds me, and so I bow down before you.This suggests that also in our incantation, the description of the witch seizing the victim that appears prior to the ritual was part of the origi-nal text.But if lines 32–36 are primary, the same cannot be said of the lists of witches and demons. That it is unnecessary to list a long series of witches is indicated, for example, by the ritually similar II 92, cited above: šina ṣalmī kaššāpi u kaššāpti ša siparri ēpuš qātukka, “By your power I have fashioned two bronze figurines of the warlock and the witch,” where the mention of only the kaššāpi u kaššāpti, “the warlock 15 Personally, I think that the verb is original to the text, for that form of the text is easier, even though the argument that it was needed to reconnect sundered lines might serve my analysis better."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"22   tzvi   abuschand the witch,” suffices and seems natural.16 The present list in II 39–50 is an example of a standard expanded list (for which, see, e.g., Maqlû I 73–8617 and AfO 18 [1957–58], 289: 1–5). It is possible, therefore, that the first pair, the warlock and witch (ša kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya, line 39), was original and that a standard series of pairs of different kinds of “witches” drawn from a standard list was added on to it, though we cannot exclude the possibility that line 39 was also secondary and that a full list comprising the standard series of pairs was inserted as lines 16 Note, moreover, that the version of our incantation preserved in KAR 240 does not contain lines 40–41 and skips from line 39 to line 42. This omission further sug-gests that the list of witches itself was built up over time, for the sequence kaššāpu, “warlock,” + rāḫû, “poisoner” (39+42: kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya + rāḫîya u rāḫītiya) seems to be an earlier one (see, e.g., VI 127 // 135: e kaššāptiya lū rāḫḫātiya, “Ha! my witch, my poisoner,” and cf. the many cases where we have just kišpū ruḫû, “witch-craft, spittle” [e.g., VII 161] and not the standard longer sequence). Assuming that line 39 existed in the original text (which in itself is not certain), lines 42ff may have been added first, and only later lines 40–41.17 Maqlû I 73–86 reads:73.

But let us leave for later the discussion of line 51, which is best discussed alongside lines 67–69, and turn instead to the list of demons and illnesses in lines 52–66. This list is set off from the pre-vious list of witches by the non-human nature of the entries and by the introduction of each entry by means of lū, “be it,” rather than by the determinative-relative pronoun ša, “of,” that introduces each pair of witches. Were the witches and demons part of one list, we would have expected also the demons to have been introduced by ša, as is the case, for example, in anašši dipāru, “I am raising the torch,” the last incantation in Tablet I, and therefore for our text to have read some-thing like “figurines of my warlock and my witch, of my sorcerer and the woman who instigates sorcery against me, of my male and female encirclers, etc. . . ., of an evil demon, of an evil spirit, of an evil ghost, of an evil constable, of an evil god, of an evil lurker, etc. . . .”19 In addi-tion, each list is characterized by a separate descriptive statement (51; 18 That kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya, “my warlock and my witch,” of line 39 could either have been part of the original text and have attracted the rest of the list or have been part of a list that was inserted is further supported by the observation that this pair may have formed the first entry of a standard list. This inference is strongly suggested by Maqlû I 73ff. That list is difficult, but it seems to point to the existence of a list with kaššāpu and kaššāptu as the first pair. Maqlû I 73ff. begins with ēpišiya . . . ēpištiya, “my sorcerer . . . my sorceress,” followed by kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya, “my warlock and my witch,” and then again ēpišiya u muštēpištiya, “my sorcerer and the woman who instigates sorcery against me,” etc. Why is ēpišiya repeated twice? An explanation would be forthcoming were we to assume that originally I 73ff only had ēpišiya u ēpištiya, to which a standard list (that began with kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya, followed by ēpišiya u muštēpištiya, etc.) was added. This solution would establish the existence of a list with kaššāpu and kaššāptu as its first entry. (I should note that the existence of a list that began with kaššāpiya u kaššāptiya and was identical with II 39ff. would render it more likely that line 39 was also secondary in this incantation and was introduced as part of the list.) 19 For such a usage with demons and the like, see simply Maqlû I 135–139:anašši dipāru ṣalmīšunu aqallu / ša utukku šēdu rābiṣu eṭemmu / lamašti labāṣi aḫḫāzu / lilû lilītu ardat-lilî / u mimma lemnu muṣabbitu amēlūti, “I am raising the torch and burning the figurines of the demon, the spirit, the lurker, the ghost, Lamaštu, Labāṣu, Aḫḫāzu (jaundice), Lilû, Lilītu, Ardat-Lilî, and any evil that seizes mankind.”"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"24   tzvi   abusch67–69). Thus, the fact that the two lists are characterized by different subjects, modes of enumeration, and descriptions20 demonstrates their separateness and strongly suggests their compositional independence.Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the list of demons is syntactically disconnected from its surrounding context and forms a parenthesis. As the text stands now, the list of demons seems to provide an expla-nation of the nature of the evil experience that, according to line 51, the witch made the victim experience. The list was apparently inserted to explicate and enumerate namrāṣu, “hardship,” in the line that pre-cedes the list and seems now to stand in apposition to line 51. Thus, while the expanded list was not part of the original incantation, the list of demons and illnesses was probably only added to the incanta-tion subsequent to the development of the list of witches. Perhaps the list of demons and illnesses was incorporated into the text in order to expand the range of the witch’s power and to (re)define her relation-ship to demons (cf. Maqlû V 57–75 and see below).We turn now to lines 51 and 67–69. Line 51 (ša ana mīti puqqudū’inni namrāṣa kullumū’inni, “who have given me over to a dead man, who have made me experience hardship”) seems to refer backward to the previously enumerated witches. One has this impression in the first instance because also this line is introduced by means of the determi-native-relative pronoun ša (here with the meaning “who”), the mode of introduction of each item in the previous list of witches. But actu-ally this form of introduction of line 51 may simply be due to the fact that when the citing of an individual witch or of a series of witches is followed by a description of her/their actions, that description is often introduced by the relative ša even when the mention of the witch had not been introduced by ša. Be that as it may, it seems reasonable to assume that this line was added following the expansion of the list of “witches” as a way of drawing the list together and of describing and summarizing what the group had done. But this chronology may not be correct; we shall reexamine this impression immediately below in our discussion of lines 67–69.We now turn to the end of the list. Lines 67–69 seem to be part of the demon section because these lines come at its end, seem to sum-marize it, and, on the face of it, seem better to describe activities that 20 Our conclusion stands even if (as is done below) the descriptions (51; 67–69) are treated together and understood to have been inserted into the text at the same time."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" revision of babylonian anti-witchcraft incantations 25suit demons and illnesses,21 particularly because of the phrase “that afflicts my flesh.” Thus, it would be reasonable to assume—as we did with line 51 in regard to the preceding list of witches—that lines 67–69 were added following the expansion of the list of demons and illnesses as a way of drawing that list together and of describing and summariz-ing the harm that these evils had done.22But the structure of lines 67–69 raises another possibility. Lines 67–69 read:67. ša ṣabtannima23 mūša u urra irteneddânni68. uḫattû šīrīya kal ūmi ṣabtannima69. kal mūši lā umaššaranni That seizes me and constantly pursues me night and day, Afflicts my flesh, seizes me all day, And does not let go of me all night.The structure of these lines is A-B-X-A’-B’, X being the phrase “who afflicts my flesh.” It seems likely that this phrase is an insertion in the middle of an otherwise closely knit parallel structure. As stated earlier, the phrase “who afflicts my flesh” suits demons and illnesses better than witches. If it is correct to regard the insertion of this phrase as part of a secondary revision, then also an earlier version of lines 67–69 might originally have referred to witches and have continued line 51.24 If so, both summary statements might have been inserted into the text at the same time. In that case, the connection between lines 51 21 Cf., e.g., W. Farber, Beschwörungsrituale an Ištar und Dumuzi (Wiesbaden, 1977), p. 131: 68–69 (transcribed and translated on pp. 144–145): mimma lemnu ša DIB-an-ni-ma(iṣbatannima) UŠ.MEŠ-ni(irteneddânni) la’bann[i] lā umaššaranni, “ ‘Alles Böse’, das mich erfasst hat und mich dauernd verfolgt, mich befallen hat, mich nicht loslässt, . . .” (but see note 23 below.).22 Accordingly, lines 67–69 would have been inserted following the insertion of the list of demons, but modeled on line 51.23 The form of ṣabātu, “to seize,” in lines 67 and 68 is written ṣab-ta/t[an]-ni-ma and should be normalized as ṣabtannima (stative+suffix). While ṣab-ta/t[an]-ni-ma may possibly be an ancient mistake for the prefix form of the verb (iṣbatannima), it seems more likely that DIB-an-ni-ma in Farber, Beschwörungsrituale, p. 131: 68, should be transcribed as ṣabtannima rather than iṣbatannima.24 The beginning of KAR 235, obv. 2’ (now missing on photo VAN 12912a and on the tablet) does not have the opening ša of line 67 (the rest of lines 67–69 are on obv. 2’–3’). Obv. 1’ has only traces and does not indicate what preceded line 67 in this manuscript. In view of the absence of ša, we may be permitted to speculate that perhaps this manuscript reflects a form of the text in which line 67 immediately con-tinued line 51 and accordingly did not require ša (*ša ana mīti puqqudū’inni namrāṣa kullumū’inni ṣabtannima mūša u urra irteddânni kal ūmi ṣabtannima kal mūši lā umaššaranni); but note the shift from the plural to the singular form of the verb."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"26   tzvi   abuschand 67–69 would have been disrupted by the insertion of the list of demons (and the similarity of lines 51 and 67–69 would then provide further support for the secondary nature of that list).But both line 51 and lines 67–69 are odd; they are quite different from typical descriptions of the activities of witches, and we should not treat them as we would other descriptions. Thus, while it is rea-sonable to suppose that both summary statements were inserted into the text at the same time, their strangeness suggests that they were inserted not prior to the insertion of the list of demons but subsequent thereto—that is, after the insertion and expansion of both lists.Perhaps one of the reasons for the insertion of lines 51 and 67–69 was to separate the lists from each other. If so, lines 67–69 were intended to describe what demons do, while line 51 was inserted to characterize the witches, introduce the demons, and connect the witch-craft and demonic sections (51a = giving man over to ghosts; 51b = giving man over to demons and the like). In any case, the witches are the ultimate cause (i.e., they give the person over to demons) and demons the proximate cause (i.e., they cause the present suffering) of the victim’s plight.Following the enumeration of demons and illnesses, the speaker first states that he is burning the figurines in sulfur and then, in lines 72–73, asks for divine assistance. The form of this final request provides fur-ther support for our conclusion regarding the secondary nature of the demon/illness section and helps us grasp more fully how the text was revised. Here the speaker turns to the god with the request: (naplisan-nima bēlu)25 usuḫšunūti ina zumriya / pušur kišpīšunu lemnūti, “(Look at me, O lord, and) uproot them from my body, release their evil witch-25 It is probably not a coincidence that the god is referred to as bēlu, “master,” both at the beginning of the request (31) and here at the end. Alongside bēlu we find the use of rêmu (rēmanni, “have pity on me”) in line 31 and naplusu (naplisanni, “look at me”) in line 72. Such usages are unexpected in an incantation to the fire-god as judge. These lines may form a secondary envelope construction that is intended to present the god not as a judge but as a gracious master. Bēlu also occurs in line 27; seizing the hem of the god(s) in lines 27–30 fits the representation of the god as a gracious master, and thus also lines 27–30 may possibly be part of the adaptation of the incantation or of the type.Furthermore, note the use of a perfect form of the verb (iltasi/u, “has (now) roared”) in line 31. Could the use of the perfect in that line rather than the normal preterite, and in contrast to the use of the preterite in lines 32–36, reflect the later insertion of line 31 and therefore belong to a different linguistic usage/stage? Elsewhere, I shall take up the question of the use of tenses/aspects in Maqlû incantations."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" revision of babylonian anti-witchcraft incantations 27craft.” The two requests, lines 72b and 73, seem to stand in parallel, but they cannot refer to the same entity for the following reasons: line 72b cannot refer to the witches and must refer to the demons and ill-nesses previously enumerated, for it is demons and illnesses that take up residence in the body, while witches normally seize their victim externally but do not invade the body.26 (One extirpates demons and illness, but kills witches.) As the text now stands, “their witchcraft” of line 73 refers back to the demons of line 72. But witchcraft is practiced by humans and not by demons, and therefore line 73 cannot refer back to line 72. Accordingly, line 72b is also an insertion, for it is meant to refer to the demons who have attacked the victim. Thus, the first request refers to disease, the second to witchcraft.At present, then, the designations of evil in the text seem to be orga-nized along a secondary chiastic pattern of hysteron-proteron:A1 Enumeration of witches (39–51)B1 Enumeration of demons (52–69)B2 Request to remove the illnesses and demons (72b)A2 Request to release witchcraft (73).Let us now summarize some of the developments that we have noted. The original kernel of the text of lines 37–73 would have read some-thing like:enenna ina maḫar ilūtika rabītišina ṣalmī siparri etgurūti (ušēpiš)ša kaššāpiya u kaššāptiyaina kibrīti elleti aqallīšunūti ašarrapšunūtinaplisannima bēlu pušur kišpīšunu lemnūti26 There are exceptions, but these reflect the late merger of the witch and illness, a development that is reflected by or is taking place in our text (see, e.g., LKA 154 + 155 //, and my discussion in “Internalization of Suffering and Illness in Mesopotamia: A Development in Mesopotamian Witchcraft Literature,” in Studi Epigrafici e Linguistici sul Vicino Oriente Antico 15 (1998) [= P. Xella, ed., Magic in the Ancient Near East]: 49–58 = Abusch, Mesopotamian Witchcraft, pp. 89–96).A comparable situation may exist in Maqlû VII 12–16. Line 14 there reads: dningišzida lissuḫšunūti, “May Ningišzida extirpate them.” Since on the face of it nasāḫu, “to extirpate, uproot,” seems to fit better with objects than persons, it seems to refer to the witchcraft rather than the witches. But that assumption creates prob-lems and confusion in the text, for in the adjoining lines the 3rd person plural suffix (both object and possessive) refers to the witches. Perhaps, there too nasāḫu with the 3rd person plural object suffix has been added to the text. Alternatively, the usage may reflect a change in the image of the witches so that they are now demonic (this does not preclude the possibility that the line was added)."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"28   tzvi   abuschNow in the presence of your great divinity, (37)Two crisscrossed bronze figurines (38)Of my warlock and my witch, . . ., (39)27In pure sulfur, I am burning them, I am scorching them.

(72a, 73)Subsequently, the incantation underwent the series of expansions and revisions that we have noted: A list of designations of different kinds of witches (39–50) was expanded in stages; then a list (52–66) of demons and illnesses was inserted.28 Perhaps at this stage, line 72b was added to the request in order to cover the aforementioned demons and ill-nesses. Subsequent to these expansions, line 37 was repeated as line 70 in order to refocus the speech on the ritual and thus reconnect stages of the ritual that had been sundered by the major digressions.The inclusion of the list of demons indicates a growth of power on the part of the witch. Demons were originally independent beings, but over time the witch became able to control non-human demonic forces in addition to other human beings. The demons’ loss of auton-omy vis-à-vis the witch is due to her increasing power, but it also appears to parallel (and be part of the same trend as) an increasing subordination of demons to the gods.29 In any case, one may suggest that the insertion of the list of demons in this incantation reflects an expansion of the range of powers of the witch, serves to redefine her relationship to demons and illness, and indicates her increasing con-trol over demons.30B.

In lines 3–4, the speaker addresses his enemies in the second person and imputes to them the repeated performance of witchcraft against him. He then asks that the two gods of magic, Ea and Asalluḫi, help him—that is, that Ea release and Asalluḫi turn back whatever witchcraft the witches had performed against him (lines 5–6). The speaker then states that he is binding the witches and giving them over to the fire god Girra, “the burner, the scorcher, the binder, the vanquisher of witches,” and expresses the wish that the fire god stand at his side and aid him (7–9). Then, in lines 10–73, the text specifies almost every imaginable act of witchcraft and repeats after each act the request that Girra undo whatever witchcraft the witch had performed. Finally, in lines 74–77, the speaker states that he has bound the witches and given them over to the fire god Girra, “the burner, the scorcher, the binder, the vanquisher of witches,” and expresses the wish that the fire god undo the witchcraft and the ritual paraphernalia used to perform witchcraft.The most notable feature of this incantation is the extensive list of witchcraft activities found in lines 10–73. Most of the entries are fol-lowed by the antiphon: “You have performed against me (or) have had performed against me: may Girra release.” In the main, the entries are not unrelated items, but appear rather in blocks that contain a number of related entries describing what the witch had done. Though there is"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" revision of babylonian anti-witchcraft incantations 35some overlapping between blocks, each block appears to be character-ized by a different action or perspective: for example, handing over (usually the verb paqādu) the victim to various entities, most notably ghosts (eṭemmu) (lines 14–23); burial and other treatment of figurines (ṣalmū) of the victim (some entries are parallel to entries in the pre-ceding group) (lines 24–43); placing water (mê)36 of the victim among the dead (lines 44–51); performance of Zikurrudâ magic in the pres-ence of various astral bodies, etc. (lines 52–62); bewitching the victim by means of food, drink, washing, salving, and messages (lines 63–67); causing the rejection (ina maḫar . . . šuškunu) of the victim by various people and groups (lines 68–73).This catalogue of witchcraft acts presents a relatively comprehensive account of what the witch can do. But various literary features—notably that the list can be divided into discreet blocks, that these blocks have some overlap, that some blocks are a bit disorganized, that some indi-vidual items deviate from the material with which they are grouped, and that the antiphon does not occur with all blocks37—all immedi-ately suggest that the list is composite.38 But whether composite or not, the list in its present form was not originally part of the incantation, for the length and scope of the list are disproportionate to its present setting in an incantation that centers upon the invocation of the fire and the description of the ritual burning of the witches. Perhaps more 36 I had originally thought that mê here referred to semen (actually, or perhaps just metaphorically), but I now accept D. Schwemer’s suggestion that “water” here refers to the water offered in a funerary ritual and thus represents the death (and death ritual ) of the victim.37 At the present time, I am not able to work out all the details of the blocks or of their incorporation. Some entries do not conform and deviate from their present environment. It is more than possible that not all long blocks were inserted at one time, and perhaps some entries were already present at the time of the composition of the incantation.The following do not conform to the overall blocks. Is it possible that they are original?14. ana mīti taḫīrā’inni, “You have betrothed me to a dead man.”15. ana gulgullati tapqidā’inni, “You have handed me over to a skull.”24. ṣalmīya ana mīti tapqidā, “You have handed over figurines of me to a dead man.”25. ṣalmīya ana mīti taḫīrā, “You have betrothed figurines of me to a dead man.”29. ṣalmīya ana gulgullati tapqidā, “You have handed over figurines of me to a skull.”51. ¢anaÜ a[ral]lê taḫīrā’inni, “You have betrothed me [to the nether]world.”38 I have not yet been able to work out the relative chronology of the incorporation of the sections."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"36   tzvi   abuschimportant in this regard is the fact that the list distances elements of a continuous performance from each other.These descriptive and critical impressions are confirmed by the exis-tence here, too, of a Wiederaufnahme:akassīkunūši akammīkunūši anamdinkunūšiana girra qāmê qālî kāsî kāšidu ša kaššāpāti (7–8)aktamīkunūši aktasīkunūši attadinkunūšiana girra qāmî qālî kāsî kāšidu ša kaššāpāti (74–75)I am binding you, I am holding you captive, I am giving you overTo Girra, the burner, the scorcher, the binder, the vanquisher of witches.I have (now) captured you, I have (now) bound you, I have (now) given you overTo Girra, the burner, the scorcher, the binder, the vanquisher of witches.We immediately note that lines 7–8 are repeated, with slight varia-tion, in lines 74–75. This repetition is a consequence of the fact that several long series of actions were included in the incantation, and they thereby separated the beginning of the incantation from its end. Lines 74–75 were thus meant to reconnect the beginning and end of a text that had been disconnected by a major digression (or expansion of an element).As noted, lines 74–75 repeat lines 7–8, but the repetition is not mechanical: the statement in line 7 is in the durative verb form (akassīkunūši akammīkunūši, . . ., “I am binding you, I am hold-ing you captive, . . .”); that in line 74 is in the perfect (aktamīkunūši aktasīkunūši, . . ., “I have (now) captured you, I have (now) bound you, . . .”).39 Because of the massive expansion of the incantation, a verbal expression that originally referred to an act taking place at the same time as the utterance, now referred to an act that had already been completed and was in the past.The repetition of elements is not limited to these lines and extends also to the short request to the fire god that follows upon the speaker’s 39 Given the position of these lines near the beginning and end of the incantation and the use of a durative in the one and a perfect in the other, it is possible to regard this repetition as an inclusio. All the same, it is a Wiederaufnahme because of the existence of blocks of material that seem to have been inserted into the incantation. The alternative would be to imagine the (composition and) incorporation of many of the blocks at the time of initial composition.

In line 9, the text reads: “May Girra, the burner, be joined to my side.” This is expanded and paralleled by lines 76–77: “May Girra, the burner, undo your bind-ings, release your witchcraft, [releas]e? your scatter-offerings.” Thus, when the author repeated the earlier lines 7–8 in lines 74–75, he also repeated the earlier line 9 in expanded form in lines 76–77. Actually, it would appear that originally, prior to the expansion of the text and the subsequent creation of repetitive resumptions, line 9 was followed immediately by the final ina qibīt formula of lines 78–79: “By the com-mand of Marduk, Ea’s son, the sage, and blazing Girra, An’s son, the warrior.” This is suggested by the fact that lines such as 9 normally occur at the end of an incantation. See, for example, the two incan-tations in KAR 80 and duplicates, where we find our line at the end of each incantation: dnuska šurbû ina qibītika litallil idāya, “At your command, may grand Nuska be joined to my side” (rev. 14); dšamaš ina pīka dgirra tappûka litallil idāya, “Šamaš, by your order, may Girra, your companion, be joined to my side” (rev. 35–36).In any case, prior to the addition of the lists of lines 10–73, the ear-lier text ended with lines 9+78–79; in this earlier text, lines 3–4 func-tioned as the description of the witches’ actions against the victim and were followed by a request in line 5(+6) that Ea and Asalluḫi release the witchcraft. Therefore the later recurring antiphon was modeled on line 5(+6); this line takes the description of the witches’ actions in line 4 as its understood object. Thus, we may conclude our analysis by say-ing that the original text probably was the present lines 1–9 + 78–79 and that the lists of malevolent actions that the witch could perform were all added secondarily. Each entry served to exemplify the general statement of line 4, and each was provided with an antiphon parallel to line 5.40 Finally, lines 7–9 were repeated in a modified form as lines 40 Line 13 (tēpušāni tušēpišāni girra lipšur, “You have performed against me, have had performed against me: May Girra release”) is the model for the antiphon in lines 14ff. represented by te-. The model for lines 10–13 is lines 4–5. Both in lines 4 and 13 as well as in the antiphones in lines 14ff., DN lipšur, “May DN release,” does not seem to have a direct grammatical object, though clearly the witchcraft or the act of witchcraft is the functional/logical object of the verb. But whereas the antiphones in 14ff. do not take the preceding entry as their direct grammatical object, both tēpušāni tušēpišāni, “you have performed against me, have had performed against me,” of line 13 and tēteneppušāni, “you who perform repeatedly,” of the second half of line 4 do take the preceding entries (10–12 and the first half of line 4, respectively) as their direct objects. Is it possible, therefore, that line 13 may have served originally not as"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"38   tzvi   abusch74–77 in order to recreate the connection sundered by the insertion of the aforementioned lists presently found in lines 10–73.Taken together, the entries generalize the power of the witch. Per-haps, then, the expansion reflects an attempt to present a full catalogue of all malevolent ritual activities that the witch could perform and thus to present her not as the limited force that she had previously been but as an almost universally powerful being.41ConclusionIn my estimation, the texts that we have examined here are the result of expansion, and the various lists were secondarily added.42 But in conclusion, I would acknowledge that it is not inconceivable that texts of this sort may sometimes have been composed in the form in which we have them, the composer himself having put the disparate mate-rials together.43 For, surely, not all repetitive resumptions represent revision. Resumption may function as an authorial device,44 and either serve an artistic purpose for a skilled craftsman or help a less than suc-cessful writer to deal with his own verbosity, expansiveness, listings, and digressions.45 Thus, even were a lengthy composite incantation to have been put together by one hand, the mode of analysis exem-plified in the present essay will have provided a model by which to an “antiphon,” and that lines 10–13, like lines 3–5, may have been part of the original incantation?41 It is probable that the types of malevolent actions attributed to the witch expanded during the first millennium to include activities that were previously not part of her primary repertoire. If one assumes (as I do) that the omen-witchcraft connection and therefore the zikurrudâ (a deadly magical practice, lit. “throat cutting”) connection are relatively late, the fact that this incantation has included such activities in prominent positions in the list would suggest that the incantation has intentionally expanded the purview of the witch’s activities by incorporating malevolent activities that were previously not associated with her.42 Cf. Sh. Shaked’s observation on the structure of the Aramaic bowl incantation MS 2053/170: “The way in which different formulae are put together in a single text. . . . One has the feeling, though, that a long text can evolve out of a fairly free juxtaposition of separate elements, that are used like building blocks” (“Form and Purpose in Ara-maic Spells: Some Jewish Themes [The poetics of magic texts],” in Sh. Shaked, ed., Offi-cina Magica. Essays on the Practice of Magic in Antiquity (Leiden/Boston, 2005), p. 7.43 Of the two incantations examined in this essay, this possibility is more likely to apply to the second rather than the first.44 See above, note 7.45 I am indebted to Martin Worthington for nudging me to reiterate the point that not all repetitive resumptions represent revision."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" revision of babylonian anti-witchcraft incantations 39understand how a composer created a long and complex incantation by assembling preexistent materials and combining disparate elements (some of his own creation) into the incantation that we now have.But where there are other reasons to believe that the text has been redacted, then the repetitive resumption should be treated as part of a revi-sion and not as original. Often such evidence exists, and I would therefore conclude by affirming my belief that the incantations studied here, as well as many others, are the result of expansion. The texts surely exemplify continuity and innovation in the Mesopotamian magical tradition.Excursus: Transcription of Maqlû II 19–75 and IV 1–79 (partial)46A. Maqlû II 19–7519.

This aims at giving the beneficiary favor, love and similar gains, normally before the king or men (and women!) in general. Up to now, three specific studies have been devoted to it. One is an article by Fara-one (1990) later reused as parts of a book (Faraone 1999: 97–110), another is a lengthy remark within the commentary by Kotansky (1994: 353–360) on such a spell attested in a Greek magical amulet. Finally, Winkler (1991, esp. pp. 218–220) noted the interlacing of spells for charm and violence, stressing how this is the necessary form in an agonistic, masked and duplicitous society.Faraone started from the Homeric description in the Iliad (14th book) of how Aphrodite provided Hera with a kestos himas to give her affection and desire in order to subdue all gods and mortals. Dis-cussing the various uses of straps, special rings or facial ointment, he pointed out some parallels in Assyrian cuneiform texts, as well as not-ing the relevant passages in the Greek magical papyri and the Cyranides (although they lay outside the time-span he was really dealing with). In spite of the enormous time-gap separating those sources, he spoke confidently of a long-standing Greek tradition of such devices, only partly visible in the extant evidence, that may be traced back directly to Mesopotamia (Faraone 1999: 104). He also noted the blurring of the categories between spells for friendship or love, for good luck and for restraining anger.Faraone’s remarks have to be seen within the context of his general work on Greek magic. This is characterized by two basic assumptions. He tends to regard as Greek much that was transmitted in the Greek-language magical manuals from the Roman Period, rather downplay-ing the Egyptian religious influence in them. If he looks for foreign"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"44 joachim friedrich quacksources and influences, his eyes are more intensely directed toward Mesopotamia, even if he still admits the presence of Egyptian elements (e.g. Faraone 1992; Faraone 1995). Although his work is understand-able as a reaction to some excessive claims of Egyptian origin made by Ritner (which in turn were a reaction to previous graecocentric works), Faraone sometimes underestimates the explanatory potential of the Egyptian culture.Kotansky took his lead from the occurrence of the rare word ἐπαφροδισία “loveliness, elegance” in the amulet he published. He noticed that exactly such an expression was used in a distinct “blessing”-formula attested in the Ptolemaic papyri of the 3rd century BCE. Apart from the documentary texts, the word is only attested in literary texts of the 2nd century CE, and only in authors having strong links with Egypt. As already noticed by Tait (1980: 194) and taken up by Kotansky, this blessing formula can be related to a Demotic greet-ing formula. Kotansky also demonstrated that extensions of this wish found in other letters combine the wish for loveliness with other items, which closely match the longer lists in some of the magical spells.In indicating the occurrence of the same rare Greek word in the magical papyri, Kotansky concluded that there was a sharing of Graeco-Demotic terms, and that the magical spells would be the nat-ural outcome of earlier prayers, or blessing formulae, in which favor and loveliness before Pharaoh were invoked. He also noticed that the social context changed, with the magical spells becoming more com-mercialized and opportunistic. They also often ask for favor before all men and women. Still, quite often, even in the magical papyri, favor before the king was specifically requested.Although Kotansky did not really discuss the question of ethnic ori-gin, his remarks have done much to clarify the situation. At the same time, it is a challenge to take up where he left off, concerning the rela-tion of the magical spells to the letter formulae, while at the same time taking the lead from his pointing out Demotic Egyptian antecedents in order to arrive at a clearer conception regarding the ultimate ori-gin. I intend to pursue those lines further, and to add a further line of inquiry—namely, concerning similar formulae in Egyptian ritual texts not normally considered magical. The two most important Egyptian key-words are ḥs.wt “favor” and mrw.t “love”—the latter, according to the typical Egyptian way of expression, the love which one inspires, not the love which one oneself feels."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 45Finding Favor in Egyptian LettersGiven that the question of letter-formulae was only touched upon by Kotansky for the Ptolemaic period, it seems necessary to expand on it. Already sporadically attested during the Old Kingdom, during the Middle Kingdom it is normal in letters to wish for the addressee that he may find favor in the eyes of specific gods (for many examples, see Collier and Quirke 2002).Forms of politeness are also attested in an oral greeting transmitted in the literary tale of pWestcar (7, 23f.) from about 1600 BCE. There, the prince is greeted with “in peace, very much, oh prince Hardjedef, beloved of his father. May your father Kheops favor you (ḥsi̯), may he promote your place in old age, may your Ka enchant things against your enemy, may your soul know the ways of yonder to the portals of the necropolis district”—a speech which is explicitly designated as “greeting of a prince” in the text. The high political standing of the addressee explains why favor before the king is mentioned here, whereas in other cases the letter-formula is restricted to wishing for the favor of the gods. We should note that the wish for a personal favored status is explicitly connected in this case with an antagonistic stance involving an anonymous enemy.Also during the New Kingdom, in the introductory formulae, it was common to wish for the addressee that he/she should be in the favor of one or another god.1 I would like to take as a sample a relatively large group of letters written at the turn of the Twentieth to the Twenty-First dynasty (Černý 1939; Janssen 1991; Demarree 2006). The typical greeting phrase is: “Be in life, prosperity and health,” followed by “in the favor of god X” (LRL 2, 2; 4, 2; 5, 2; 6, 2; 7, 2f.; 9, 2; 12, 2f.; 14, 1f.; 15, 15f.; 17, 5; 21, 6; 22, 9; 27, 3; 28, 15f.; 38, 1f.; 39, 14f.; 41, 12; 44, 7; 55, 4f.; 57, 3; 62, 5; 65, 3); or “I say to god X: ‘Grant you favor before god X’ ” (LRL 1, 4; 12, 5), expanded to: “I say to god X: ‘Grant you life, prosperity and health. Grant you favor before god X’ ” (LRL 3, 3; similarly 38, 2f.; 39, 8f.; 42, 13–15; 44, 13f.; 57, 5f.; 67, 8f.; 68, 16–69, 1); or “Grant you much favor” (LRL 4, 3; 7, 9; 23, 8); or “Grant you favor before the gods and men every day” (LRL 13, 5; 16, 1f.; BM 10440, rt. 5f.); or “Let you be in the favor of the gods and men” (LRL 40, 1f.).1 This topic was discussed only very briefly by Bakir 1970: 55."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"46 joachim friedrich quackMore specifically: “I say to every god and every goddess whom I see daily: “Grant you life, prosperity and health, and much favor before the general, your lord’ ” (LRL 14, 6f.; similarly 22, 12; 28, 1; 48, 11f.; 66, 7f.;); combined as: “Grant you life, prosperity and health, a long life and a good old age, and very many favors (ḥsw.t) before Amonra-sonther and before the general, your lord” (LRL 27, 8f.); without men-tioning the gods (LRL 29, 7–9); or simply: “Grant you many favors before the general, your lord” (LRL 31, 12f.).Also instructive is a letter which the mayor of Elephantine writes to the chief of taxes, both of them high-ranking officials (Gardiner 1950). The greeting formula at the beginning is: “May Amun-Re favor Men-maatrenakht! The mayor of Elephantine Meriunu sends a message: (Be) in life, prosperity and health, in the favor of Amonrasonther. [I say to] Amun-Re, to Harakhte when he rises and sets, to Khnum, Satis and Anukis, all gods of Elephantine: Keep the chief of taxes in health; give him long life and a good old age! Give him favor (ḥsw.t) before Amonrasonther, his good master, and before Pharaoh, his good mas-ter every day” (pValençay 1, 1–6).A shorter notice in another letter is not directly linked to the greet-ing, but rather set within the main text as a wish for a positive reaction after having heard good news: “May Amonrasonther favor (ḥsi̯) you, may Month favor you, may the Ka of the Pharaoh, your lord, favor you, after you have driven off the enemies of the Shasu” (P. ESP, l. 53–55; Helck 1967: 148).These last examples show options with persons of somewhat higher standing. For them, not only the favor of the gods (with whom everybody had to deal ) was important, but they were also in closer contact with high-ranking entities such as the general or even the Pharaoh himself, so that it made sense to wish for favor before them specifically.Some remarkable points can also be gleaned from model letters of the New Kingdom preserved in several Ramesside manuscripts (Gar-diner 1937; Caminos 1954). A fairly simple greeting formula mention-ing just the gods is, for example, “Be in life, prosperity and health, in the favor (ḥsi̯.t) of Amonrasonther. I say to Re-Harakhte at his rising and his setting, to all the gods of the city of Ramses, beloved of Amun, the great Ka of Re-Harakhte: May you be in the favor (ḥsi̯) of Amon-rasonther, the Ka of Merenre, your good lord every day!” (LEM 7, 12–16); or “I say to Amun, . . . to all gods and goddesses of Thebes: May you be healthy, may you live, let me see you being healthy, and that I"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 47fill my embrace with you, you being in the favor (ḥsw.t) of gods and men!” (LEM 10, 5–11). The last case invokes the favor of men as well as gods, but only on a very unspecific level.A somewhat fuller form is: “Be in life, prosperity and health, in the favor (ḥsi̯.t) of Amonrasonther. I say to Re-Harakhte, to Seth, to Nephthys and all gods and goddesses of the pleasant area: May you live, may you be healthy, let me see you being healthy, and let me fill my embrace with you, and furthermore: I have heard the many good deeds which you have done for my boat in letting it come. May Montu favor (ḥsi̯) you, may Re favor you, your good lord!” (LEM 5, 14–6, 3). In this case we have the specific element of personal thanks because of services rendered; it is deemed suitable to express this only by again asking for the favor of the gods, not of the government.Other instances involve the king or the administrative elite: “Be in life, prosperity and health, in the favor (ḥsi̯.t) of Amonrasonther. I say to Re-Harakhte, to Amun, to Ptah and the gods and goddesses of the western shore: May you be healthy, may you live, may you be rejuve-nated, and may you be in the favor (ḥsi̯) of Pharaoh, your good lord, every day!” (LEM 6, 16–7, 3; similar 8, 10–13).“May the one of the primeval time of the two lands, Amun-Re the creator of the gods, act for you, may he grant you the favor (ḥsw.t) which is with the king, your mouth being safe, without a fault of your lips being brought up, you being in the favor of the king in your time, the Horus, beloved of Maat” (LEM 38, 10–13)—continued in the style of mortuary glorifications. We should note the stress laid on the absence of negative acts of speech (mouth and lips) which will be of relevance for the global interpretation.“May you find Amun, that he may act according to your heart in his hour of grace, you being favored (ḥsi̯) among the princes, and set firmly in the place of truth” (LEM 45, 14–15).“Be in life, prosperity and health; be in the favor of Amonrasonther, the Ka of the king User-Kheperu-Re, whom Re has chosen. I say to Re-Harakhte: ‘Keep the Pharaoh in health, our good lord! Let him celebrate millions of jubilees while you are daily in his favor!’ ” (LEM 62, 1–5; cf. 66, 12–15; 69, 15–70, 2; 70, 13–16; 125, 10–15). In one case, this formula gains particular relevance since it is couched in a letter of congratulation for receiving promotion as a military officer.Given that these are mainly model letters, not actual archival mate-rial, we gain access to higher levels of society than is usual in our preserved record from Egypt. That could explain the relatively high"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"48 joachim friedrich quackamount of wishes for favor before the king which decidedly surpasses that in original letters.For the Demotic letters, the spectrum of attestations can also be broadened by some interesting cases (see Depauw 2006b). First, the text already adduced by Kotansky: “We are greeting Sarapion, the dioicetes, here before Soukhos, lord of Pay, Isis Nepherses. They may make for you every protection of life, and they may grant2 you every long life, every good thing,3 and they may grant you favor (ḥsi̯.t), love (mri̯.t) and worth (šw) before the king . . . in eternity” (pOx. Griffith 13, rt. 5–9; Bresciani 1975: 12f.; pl. 4). This text again is notable for mentioning the favor before the king, and is again directed to a very high-ranking official—namely the dioicetes whose function is compa-rable to that of a minister of finance of the state.Another example from the same archive: “I greet the priests of Soukhos, lord of Pay, and of Isis Nepherses before the gods of the city of the lions, and may they grant you all protection of life, favor (ḥs.t) and love (mri̯.t)” (pOx. Griffith 25, 2–5; Bresciani 1975: 28f.; pl. 14).A rather different formula from Elephantine, probably somewhat earlier, is: “I greet Nes-Khnum-Meti, the first prophet before Osiris, Horus and Isis, the gods of Abydos. May they grant that you be high in the favors of Khnum, the great god.” (pBerlin 13587, x+1–5; in Zauz-ich 1978).From a different locality, we have: “I greet the overseer of fields before Soukhos. He will make stable the house of Teos, the overseer of fields, in the favor (ḥsi̯.t)4 of the king in eternity” (pLoeb 6, 6–11; Spiegelberg 1931; 17f.). Once again, for a high-ranking official the favor of the king is specifically mentioned.On an unusual writing surface—namely, a limestone tablet—we have: “[May Amonrasonther the] great [god grant] you a long life, and he will give you favor (ḥsi̯.t) before the king Haronophris [beloved of Isis], beloved of Amonrasonther, the great god, together with all those of the royal palace” (Tablet Cairo 38258; see Depauw 2006a: 97).More in the line of spells for averting danger or damage is the fol-lowing: “It is [NN son of ] Petesis who greets Petosiris-Espmet, Son 2 Read probably č̣i̯.t rather than sḥn (thus Bresciani), in spite of the strange sign which precedes it.3 Read ¡ḥ¡ ḳy nb¢ı ʾ Üḫ( y) nbnfr.4 To be read h̠n t# ḥsi̯(.t), and not h̠n n# ḥsi̯.w, as proposed by Spiegelberg."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 49of Bai-ankh . . . here before Khnum Nikephoros, and may he save you, and preserve you, and let everything befitting happen to you, and may he grant that we will see your face without any damage in every good affair” (pBerlin 15518, 1–7; in Zauzich 1978); similarly, “I greet you here before Osiris, Horus and Isis, the gods of Abydos, and may they grant that I encounter you without damage” (pBerlin 13564, 1–4; in Zauzich 1993); similarly, “I greet you before Ptah, the great god. May he grant that I will see you without damage” (pBerlin 15617, 1; in Zauzich 1993). For evaluating the Late Antique magical attestations, it should be mentioned that such wishes can serve as a valid alternative to wishes for favor.It should be noted in fairness, however, that all cases cited here are rather exceptional. The most normal demotic epistolary formula, if any is used, is simply, “may the sun-god grant you a long life.”Perhaps it is not inappropriate to point out that the words in ques-tion can have a very basic meaning in the context of other letters. In particular, this concerns requests by lower-ranking people to their superiors. There, we have phrases such as ôw⸗f ḫpr ôw mri̯⸗w s ô:ôr-ḥr⸗k “if it happens that it is loved before you” or ôw⸗f ḫpr ôw⸗s ḥsi̯ “if it happens that it is favored” as highly polite and indirect introductions. Such usages are instructive regarding what the wish really implies. When the recipients of letters will find themselves in a situation con-fronting higher-ranking entities, be they gods or the king, they would hope that their proposals and desires will be granted.From the Greek side, a typical expression already cited by Kotan-sky is: “Know that Hesies is Isis, may she grant you favor [before the king]” (PSI IV 328 = P. Zenon Pestman 50, 5f.; cf. Hölbl 1993: 17–20) dating from the 3rd century BCE. Equally relevant are some phrases in the archive of the Katochoi of Memphis, where the addressee is thanked for his accomplishments, such as: “for this now, may Sarapis and Isis grant you loveliness, grace and shape before the king and the queen” (UPZ I 33, 8–10 = 34, 5–6 = 35 12–14 = 36, 10–12; Kotansky 1994: 358f.).Summing up, we find many instances of wishes for favor in Egyptian letters and greeting speeches of all periods. Typically, this is the favor of the gods. Wishes for favor before the king or high-ranking officials are relatively rare, and seem to be restricted to persons of particularly high social standing. This makes sense, because only the elite would be likely to come into contact with the king in a situation where his favor would be an important factor. Quite notable in particular in the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"50 joachim friedrich quackRamesside model letters, as well as in the greeting to a prince, is the antagonistic stance against enemies combined with one’s own success. I will return to that later. Such combinations are instructive for the social reality behind the polite greetings.Glorification-style Wishes for FavorI would like to return now to the group of model letters I used earlier in order to take up some exceptional cases which by their length over-step the limits of ordinary politeness. There is a composition almost totally devoted to such formulae: “Oh Mapu, you will be firmly in place, your Ka with you every day; being daily in joy and exuberance, being favored (ḥsi̯) a million times. Happiness and rejoicing cling to you, your limbs are extolling health. You produce an excess of reju-venation day by day. No adversary will approach you. The year will come, and your good deeds will be remembered. Nobody like you will be found. Your eye is bright every day, your ear firm, you will mul-tiply good years. Your months are in safety, your days with life and strength, your hours in health; your gods are in peace with you. They are content with your utterances. The Good West sends to you. You are not becoming old, you are not becoming sick, you will complete 110 years on earth, while your limbs are firm, such as is done for somebody who is favored (ḥsi̯) like you, while his god favors him. The lord of the gods entrusts you to the lords of the western mountain, food offerings will come forth for you from Busiris, libations from the necropolis. May your soul come forth and walk around in every place it likes” (LEM 24, 11–25, 7; Tacke 2001: 34–35). This covers the whole life-span till beyond the burial, with earthly as well as funerary wishes—the former ones largely outnumbering the latter ones.Some of the models in this collection are written in the style of longer glorifications (LEM 37, 8–38, 7; 63, 15–64, 6). Noticeable here is the confrontation with antagonists which is combined with the oth-erwise adulatory form. We hear a recurring phrase: “your enemy is fallen; the one who spoke against you, he does not exist. You have entered before the ennead and have come forth justified” (LEM 38, 6–7 = LEM 64, 5–6).In my opinion, it is appropriate to follow the line of this antagonis-tic stance further by studying one particular composition which has up to now defied the interpretation of Egyptologists (pAnastasi V, rt. 7, 5–8, 1 = pChester Beatty V rt. 6, 7–12). The text runs as follows:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 51Praise to you, while the lotus is in blossom,While the . . . -birds are pinioned,While your troop is sent out into the field,And their retainers are branded,While your hot one is in the wrath of Amun!He is an abomination for men,The sun will not rise in his sight,The inundation does not flow for him.He is like a mouse trapped by high inundation.He does not find a place to lean on.The kite strikes in order to catch him,The crocodile is ready for tasting of him.5This was first understood as a description of the sorry plight of the army officer in summer-time (Gardiner 1937: 59). A more recent anal-ysis has interpreted it as a description of epileptic fits (Fischer-Elfert 2005: 91–163). My own understanding of this composition would dif-fer again. I propose reading the first four lines of this composition in the style of a glorification extolling the pleasant life of the addressee who enjoys a typical Egyptian pastime of the elite: going into the fields, fowling and fishing. To enhance this ideal, a contrast is drawn with the “hot one” of the addressee, whom I understand as the antagonistic adversary. For him, life in the countryside is supposed to bring about not enjoyment but the opposite: danger and even death. The Egyptians even seem to revel in the detailed description of his misery.One highly important point should be stressed: Egyptologists tend to understand glorifications as funerary compositions (Assmann 2002: 13–37). In some of the cases I have adduced here, however, neither the context nor the actual wording gives any hints that the justification before the ennead has to be understood as a post-mortal judgment of the dead. At least, nothing else in the specific text has any mortuary implications.This observation forces me to take up the thorny discussion about the origin of the judgment of the dead as codified in Book of the Dead, spell 125. It was once universal and is still the dominant position to understand it simply as a funerary composition. However, an alternative theory was presented by Merkelbach (1968; 1987) and Grieshammer (1974). They took their lead from a Greek-language papyrus containing 5 The last two lines are translated here according to the version of pChester Beatty V, 6, 11f. pAnastasi V, 7, 8–8,1 has instead: “He is like a pinioned bird. He does not find an opportunity to fly.”"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"52 joachim friedrich quackan oath of Egyptian priests spoken at the occasion of the investiture. This contained phrases quite similar to the declarations of innocence in the Book of the Dead. The two German scholars postulated the ori-gin of the funerary declarations in priestly customs. Others disagreed, mainly pointing out that the Greek papyrus of the 2nd century CE was too late to be of relevance for the much older attestations of the Book of the Dead (Griffiths 1991: 218–224; Lichtheim 1992: 127).I myself have re-opened the question by pointing out that the Greek papyrus in question is only the translation of a passage from the Egyp-tian Book of the Temple (Quack 1997), but at the same time proposing that the chapter in the Book of the Dead more likely originates in rituals at the royal court, not the priestly milieu of the temple (Quack 2004a: 18–19). The most important reason for my position is the postscript preserved in some manuscripts of chapter 125. The crucial passage is: “Concerning the one for whom this text is made, he will prosper, and his children will prosper, he will be a confidant of the king and his court.” This, combined with the importance of not having committed any sort of blasphemy against the king in the text, makes me wonder if the ritual might not originally have been designated to declare court-iers as pure (and thus fit to be in the presence of the king). The final aim of the ritual, to receive rations officially, would fit a hypothetical situation at the royal court (depending on royal largesse) as well as the funerary setting from which we have the actual attestations.While the text, often designated as “negative confession,” is out-wardly a declaration of innocence, it has further-reaching implications. As a ritual, it is not only intended to note objective blamelessness, but also to constitute it by its very enactment. Performing the ceremony without fault would achieve a state of purity and innocence for the recipient independently of his real merits.Rituals for Purification and Gaining FavorThis should induce us to look much more closely at several rituals for purification and protection for the benefit of the living, which are in any way combined with the justification against enemies. An important ritual involving Thot is preserved in pChester Beatty VIII rt. 1, 1–5, 3. It first enumerates the different courts of the gods, and praises Thot at the evocation of each one as the god who satisfied the heart of Osiris against his enemy. The final prayer runs as follows:"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 53“May you be pacified toward NN whom NN has born, may every god and every goddess be pacified toward him, may you make his life-span enduring in years of life, his love (mrw.t), his charm, his sweetness in the belly of every man, every nobleman, every commoner and every sunfolk etc.” (rt. 4, 1–3).In this case, the aim of purification is obviously quite similar to the later charitesia; it is all about gaining affection; and the way to achieve it is to overcome all possible enemies at all possible judicial courts.Of some significance is also the phrase, “The year will come, and your good deeds will be remembered” in the model letter quoted above (LEM 24, 15). The key-word “remember” induces me to take up another ritual of protection, this time in pChester Beatty IX vs. B 12, 10–18,10 (Gardiner 1935: 110f.; pl. 60; Quack 2006a: 149f.): “A good day! Your mouth is opened; all your enemies are felled among the dead and the living. Horus pours water over your fingers; Geb (the god of earth) hands over to you what is in him; your face is washed by your father Nun. Your face is rubbed dry by Hedjhotep(?).6 Ptah turns him-self to you with the clothing as he did for Re. Your mouth is opened with good speech and choice utterances. One remembers for you on the good day and forgets for you bad things on the good day. Heaven and earth are festive. The gods are rejoicing. Jubilation is in the great house, acclamation in the Benben-house. May you take food in the presence of the great ennead while everybody is praying for health for you; and your heart is rejoicing. Nothing ‘wrinkled’ which you have done will be reproached. There is no evil whatsoever adhering to your limbs, [. . .] shall be heard for you in the presence of the lords of truth. Oh NN whom NN has born, Re purifies you at his coming forth, Thot at his appearance, when this utterance is told to you which Isis said to her son Horus: You are purified on the sixth day of the lunar month, you are protected on the last day of the lunar month” (pChester Beatty IX vs. B 12, 10–13, 9).There follows a long list of divinities supposedly purifying and pro-tecting the recipient. The final prayer runs as follows: “Oh all you gods and goddesses, come united that you may purify NN whom NN has born, may you drive out every evil from him, as Re is purified every 6 This is a proposal for emendation.

You, NN whom NN has born—<destined for> you10 are these gods whose names have been pronounced. You were born in front of the kas of the living.” (pChester Beatty IX vs. B 17, 1–18, 7).This long text which has been somewhat neglected by Egyptologists is actually highly instructive. It is embedded in a long ritual of puri-fication and protection. This seems to be enacted specifically accord-ing to important days of the lunar month. There is no very specific indication of the aims, but the antagonism against enemies turns up repeatedly, combined with the reception of food for the recipient of the ritual—the last point structurally similar to the promise of rations expressed in Book of the Dead, chapter 125. We should also note the phrase about the mouth being opened with good speech and choice utterances. This returns us once again to the question of appropriate speech-acts, which I discerned already in one formula of the model letters. Obviously, critical statements or even murmurs of rebellion (or things which could be so construed) were among the most risky 7 The facsimile of the hieratic signs given by Gardiner is more in favor of a reading c# than of Gardiner’s ¡. 8 The words translated here neutrally as “bitterness” and “heat” are not unlikely to refer specifically to some skin diseases, see Quack 2005a. 9 The text switches for one sentence from the third to the second person in speak-ing of the recipient.10 I emend to ôw <n>⸗k nn n nčr.w.

An act of “natural” purification is often a starting point for ritual purification which has to be undergone (Stolz 1999). On the one hand, the action is elevated by being ascribed to deities; on the other, it is not simply a physical act—the verbal recitation gives it a higher meaning.More outwardly than the Book of the Dead, chapter 125, this is not simply a text about ascertaining pureness, it is about creating it. Shortcomings are openly admitted and passed to a state of forgetful-ness while only the good actions remain in memory, and this social memory is what counts when it comes to achieving the goals, which are to achieve protection in such a way that ensures further success in life, with no enemy being able to use potential flaws to his own ends and your downfall.Another text meriting closer inspection is the ostracon Deir el-Medineh 1080 (Fischer-Elfert 1997: 108–113; Quack 1999: 139) which also seems to contain a sort of ritual purification. After an invocation to Thot as the one reckoning time and Sakhmet and other female god-desses, we get the key phrases: “May they provide protection of life, stability and strength, may they unite happiness. I am pure [. . .] on the sixth day of the lunar month. Nothing which enters my belly will go astray, nothing which is in me will get defiled. My house is equally provided. [. . . I will not] go down to [. . .], I will not be forgotten. Every implement is purified, pure like Re is pure in heaven, and Geb is pure in the earth. The four great ones, the lords of the sacred land purify me. [. . .].”This text has the orientation in the lunar calendar in common with the previous one. Its state of preservation makes a close analysis more difficult. It might be no more than a “household-spell.” However, the question about being forgotten or remembered establishes an inherent connection with the rituals I have discussed before, as does the date in the lunar month given here.Quite instructive is a little-studied prayer to Thot preserved on a writing tablet of the early 18th dynasty (Turajeff 1895: 120–123). After an introductory hymn in honor of Thot, the relevant passage is: “Hail to you, Thot! I am the one who adores you. May you give me a house"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"56 joachim friedrich quackand possessions! May you equip me, may you provide for my life in the land of the living for whose life you have provided in the island of fire! May you place my love (mrw.t), my favor (ḥsw.t), my [. . .], my sweetness, my protection in the belly, in the heart, in the breast of everybody, all noblemen, all commoners, all sunfolk etc.! May you overthrow my male and female enemy among the dead or the living!” (l. 6–8). Here again the social setting of love and favor is combined with the overthrowing of enemies. According to its postscript, the text is to be recited after having sacrificed to Thot, and it is a spell to justify a man against enemies—quite evidently in a non-funerary context.More funerary in its setting, but still of clearly recognisable inten-tion, is a text transmitted in the tomb of Ibi in the 26th dynasty (Kuhl-mann and Schenkel 1983: 257f.) with a partial parallel of Ramesside date (Assmann 1983: 224–226). The basic text is a hymn to the sun-god with a particular emphasis on the overthrowing and destroying of its enemy. This is connected with a prayer in favor of Ibi, and the sun-god is asked to put his love, his charm and his renown in the belly of all men. Again we can see how achieving love and favor is connected with the overthrowing of enemies on the real and conceptual level.Prayers for Favor and a Successful CareerTo be reconsidered further are some prayers to gods, mainly preserved in the same corpus of papyri as the model letters which I have cited above (Fecht 1965; Assmann 1999: 407–422). They have been studied for their metrics as well as for their so-called “personal piety.” What has been less focused on is their social setting. At least partially, they are prayers for success in the career as a civil administrator. The most obvious case is also a good starting point because it makes use of the key-word ḥsi̯.“May you find Amun acting according to your desire in his hour of grace, you being in favor (ḥsw.(t)) among the high officials, made firm in the place of truth. Oh Amun-Re, your high inundation is overflow-ing the mountains, lord of fishes with many birds—every poor man is satiated! Place the high officials in the place of high officials, the great ones in the place of the great ones! Place the scribe of the treasury Qai-Geba before Thot, your truthful one!” (LEM 45, 14–46, 2; Fecht 1965: 62–65).Such a text is a good example of how favor was equivalent to pro-motion and a successful career. It can be matched by several prayers"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 57to Thot either asking for skill and success, or thanking him for having given his help (e.g. Fecht 1965: 52–58; 65–73). I will however concen-trate on one fairly famous text, a prayer to Thot:Oh Thot, set me into Hermopolis,your city of sweet life!You will make provisions for me with bread and beer,you will guard my mouth in speaking!Would that I had Thot for me as protector tomorrow!‘Come,’ it would be said,when I have entered before the lords,‘that you may go forth justified!’Oh great dum-palm of 60 cubits,the one on which there are nuts.There are kernels in the nuts,while there is water in the kernels.The one who has taken water from far away,Come, that you may rescue me, the silent one!Oh Thot, the pleasant well for a thirsty man in the desert,it is closed for the one who has found his speech,it is open for the silent one.May the silent one come, that he finds the well!Oh hot one, you are under control!”11 (LEM 85, 15–86, 9).This text has up to now generally been understood to refer to the judg-ment of the dead. On close examination, it seems difficult to pinpoint it to such an occasion, and several details would be much more appro-priate in a setting for the living. The first part, with the wishes for a placement in the cultic city of Thot and for provisions, is certainly to be understood as benefit for the living, as is the last one concerning the well that is only accessible to the “silent one.” Also, there is nothing of post-mortal relevance in the passage about the dum-palm and its nuts. Were it not for the preconceived opinions of Egyptologists (who are generally too concerned with death and the afterlife), nothing would prevent us from applying the judgment passage to a situation of the living. We could of course speculate, given the setting of the prayer within a manuscript which is probably a school-text, whether the cru-cial test for which help is desired might be the final exam deciding whether you would enter a career as a functionary of the state. In any event we can note that once again, special precaution is considered 11 Literally “taken, grasped.”"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"58 joachim friedrich quackto be important when it comes to verbal utterances for which specific protection is desired.Especially noteworthy is the last line. Most commentators have pro-posed more or less serious emendations while the text makes perfect sense as it stands. Given the other texts I have presented here, it is not surprising that a prayer for personal success is combined with an antagonistic stance against an enemy who is said to be in firm grasp, and thus under control and incapable of doing harm.Besides, a further prayer with a similar theme should be compared, as already noted by Assmann (1999: 414). This one, on an ostracon in Cairo, runs as follows:“The one who is poor calls to you, oh Amun!The one who is powerful seeks you.The one who is in Syria (says) ‘come, bring me back to Egypt!’.The one who is in the underworld (says) ‘save me!’The one who stands before the ruler (says) ‘Give breath, oh Amun!’Would that I had Amun as protector tomorrow!‘Come’ would be said.I have looked behind me and I saw Amun.His breath entered my body.Happy is your servant, oh Amun!Every evil has left him.” (HO 5, 1; Černý and Gardiner 1957, pl. 5; see also Kitchen 2007: 152).The central motif of hope for the successful outcome of an impending lawsuit unites this text with the previous one. By positing the audience situation before a ruler as one of several situations where Amun can be helpful, the author makes the this-worldly situation a bit clearer. With the final phrase “every evil has left him,” we reach the ground already covered by several of the previously cited texts. Complete guiltlessness is hardly a realistic option, but ritual and prayer serve to efface pos-sible sins.The “Hot One” as an AdversaryThe key-word of the “hot one” which we have encountered in the prayer to Thot as well as in the passage contrasting the happy life of the addressee with the terrible fate of the “hot one” (pAnastasi V, rt. 7, 5–8, 1 = pChester Beatty V rt. 6, 7–12) makes it necessary to take up several more compositions treating this topic, especially the Ramesside"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 59ostracon Deir el-Medine 1265 and the famous chapter 4 of the instruc-tions of Amenemope. Recently, an effort has been made to understand all those descriptions of the “hot one” as somebody who is suffering from epilepsy (Fischer-Elfert 2005: 91–163). While such a diagnosis seems quite reasonable to me in the description of the suffering man in pDeir el-Medine 1 verso (Fischer-Elfert 2005: 142–148), a text that does not use the expression “the hot one,” I seriously doubt its rel-evance for the actual attestations of this expression. In all of them, I prefer to understand the “hot one” as the adversary of the hero figure. This adversary is characterized either by negative behavior which he actively practices, or by the social punishments resulting from such behavior. As a case in point, I would mention the passage in oDeM 1265, II, 10 “he who twinkled with his eyes, he is fallen.” Fischer-Elfert took this to be the description of a restless person who has fits (2005: 134). In reality, the verb črm is attested also in the negative confes-sions of Book of the Dead chapter 125, B 26 (Maystre 1937: 87). There it designates a blameable action, and most likely serves as a kind of signal for a hidden agreement between the judge and one of the two parties—which, in the case of the ostracon DeM 1265, does not suc-ceed in defeating the just case of the righteous man.Highly instructive is ostracon Borchard 1 with a partial parallel in ostracon Torino CG 50367 (Mathieu 1996: pl. 22–24), a text over-looked by Fischer-Elfert (2005) and seriously misunderstood by pre-vious commentators, who introduced unnecessary emendations and misunderstood the crucial points (Mathieu 1996: 114; Kitchen 1999: 398f.). As transmitted, the text can be easily translated:A happy day it is to see you,my brother, it is a great favor (ḥsy(.t)) to look at you!May you be introduced to me with beer!The musicians (ḥsy.w) are equipped with instruments,while their mouths are equipped with (songs of ) entertaining,of joy and happiness,after your hot one was brought backwards,while you are clever in your office.One speaks, and then your voice is listened to.The one who has denounced you was brought down.Your capable sister is in adoration before you,kissing the ground to see you.May she be accepted as beer and incense,like the pacifying of a god."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"60 joachim friedrich quackObviously, again we find the topic of favor combined with triumph over an adversary. There is an obvious word-play between “favor” (ḥsy.t) and “musicians” (ḥsy.w). As seen in this text, it is not a wish but has already happened. What makes this poem so special is that the theme of social favor and triumph here is obviously connected with personal love, expressed here in the mouth of a female lover who pronounces it and offers herself and her love as an offering fit for a god. This foreshadows in some way the shift of the charitesia from social success to gaining personal love, which will be relevant for the Graeco-Roman period.Promises of Favor in the “Oracular Amuletic Decrees”Besides the wishes, we also have promises. They occur within the framework of the so-called “Oracular Amuletic Decrees” which had a sudden peak of popularity in the 21st and 22nd dynasties (Edwards 1960; Bohleke 1997). They contain long lists of promises made and guaranteed by gods, mainly for protecting the proprietor and keeping him healthy. To some degree, they are also concerned with social suc-cess, and in three of them, granting favor is relevant. “I will grant her favor with A[mun], Mut, and Chons without his slaying; I will grant her favor with every action of Month without [. . .]” (L2 rt. 87–90), or “We will grant her favor before Amun, Mut, and Chons, she being flourishing and she will not be slain” (T2 rt. 90). Both of these texts combine the promise of favor with the negation of “slaying” (š¡ṭ) which I take to mean the actual threat of capital punishment.12 Such a contrast is also attested in the formulae of the donation stelae (see below). Slightly different is the last case: “I will put his favor and love in the heart of king Osorkon beloved of Amun, my beautiful child” (L7 27–30). Here, the beneficiary is of especially high standing, actu-ally a prince, so the direct contact with the king is relevant. The fixed expression ḥs(w.t)-mr(w.t) should be noted, as it is the very one which occurs later in the demotic magical spells.12 Edwards (1960: 18 and 66) understood it simply as a reference to a ceasing or diminishing."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 61Wishes for Favor in Festive SituationsAlso in relatively “private” situations, wishes for favor can be expressed. I would like to illustrate this by a few scenes taken from the tomb of Rekhmire, a vizier under the kings Thutmosis III and Amenhotep II. In a festival context, the daughters of the vizier Rekhmire present him with sistra while saying: “May the daughter of Re, who loves you, favor you; may she place her protection around you day by day. She embraces your flesh. May you lift her majesty, and then she embraces your breast. May you spend a long lifetime of happiness on earth, life, prosperity and health having joined you!” (Davies 1943: 60; pl. LXIII). To understand the text, it is essential that Hathor, daughter of the sun-god and goddess of love, was symbolized by the very sistrum Rekhmire is receiving and supposed to lift up.In a festive contest, the mother of Rekhmire receives a friendly greeting while being poured a drink: “For your Ka, may you spend a happy day! May you exist on earth! Amun, your lord, has decreed it to you; may he favor you and love you!” (Davies 1943: 60; pl. LXIV).At the same fest, a singer addresses Rekhmire directly: “How happy are those years which the god has decreed that you will spend, being joined with favor, in good health, and happy. You will be [enduring],13 your voice will be justified, your enemy felled in your house which is united with all eternity!” (Davies 1943; pl. LXVI). This last case shows once again how wishes for success are not uniquely positive, but joined with the concomitant defeat of an antagonist. It can be regarded in the context of a long tradition of combining the motif of feasts and offering-meals with the annihilation of enemies (Quack 2006d).Reflections on Favor ObtainedFrom all these wishes, prayers and rituals, we can proceed to reflections on the actual occurrences of favor. Since I have already mentioned above that apart from prayers to Thot for help in the professional career, there are also prayers thanking him for having achieved 13 Given the fact that this word was deliberately hacked out, it is likely to have shown a graphic resemblance to the name of Amun which later fell victim to the iconoclasm of Akhenaton; so it is reasonable to restore [mn].¢tô Ü."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"62 joachim friedrich quacksuccess, it would be appropriate to begin with a composition trans-mitted in Demotic, the so-called “Book of Thot” (Jasnow and Zauz-ich 2005; Quack 2007). This text focuses on the access of a scribe to the higher levels of esoteric knowledge. It also contains praise to the teacher for having achieved success. The crucial lines, spoken by the candidate, are:“Oh may your art of elevating be rejuvenated in front of the house of documents with the children of your instruction.You have been a craftsman for me, you have reduced (?) my trouble, and you have taken control of my [. . .]You have been a cultivator for me while I was like a field; I being worthy that you make a registration (?) for me.I was given to you when I was a block; you have opened me as a statue, you have been a life-giving craftsman.You have set free my tongue, you have opened for me the path, you have given me the way of coming and going.You have diminished my hatred and brought my love (mri̯.t), you have let my favor (ḥsi̯.t) come up quickly.You have made me ‘old’ while I was young, so that I could send those older than me in your business.14You have given me the status while I was a child; I could sit at rest while the great ones were standing.You have caused me to be abundant in nurses while I was solitary; you have made for me a troop of youths.The flame (?) of your mouth has revealed to me food provisions; the efficiency of your belly has flowed over me.” (B 02, 7/4–13).Much could be said about this complex text, but for my actual inves-tigation it is sufficient to stress how the professional career (entailing food provisions and the respect of others) is bound up with questions of love and favor. The benefactor is in this case the teacher, although it can be disputed whether he is really the god Thot himself, as Jasnow and Zauzich thought.A certain set of expressions shows a remarkable fluctuation between attributing favor and its benefits to divine or royal authorship (Ass-mann 1979; Assmann 1980). Some cases from the Amarna period, at a time when only one god was officially recognized and success to a great extent depended upon the king, can illustrate the expressions: “I will tell you the benefits which the ruler did for me. He let me 14 Or “by your magical efficiency”."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 63unite with the princes and courtiers, I was made great and honored, I thought about joining the princes. I found thee as a wise king. A sun is his majesty who has built the poor one whom he favors (ḥsi), who has made princes by his Ka. Destiny which gives life, lord of orders; one lives while he is at peace” (Tomb of Panehsy, Sandman 1938: 25, 6–9).The Menace of PunishmentSuch favors are typically connected with their antithesis—namely, punishment of lack of loyalty. In the same Amarna texts, there are also expressions such as, “He inflicts punishment on him who does not know (recognize) his teaching, his favor for the one who knows him according to the fact that you obey the king.” (Sandman 1938: 86, 15–16).With other cases, we definitely move from divine favor to gaining royal favor, which brings us closer to the magical spells I intend to study. Obtaining royal favor was an important point for the Egyp-tian elite, as evidenced by the ideal biographies put up in the tombs. Already in the Old Kingdom, we have many tomb inscriptions stress-ing that the owner was favored by the king, and sometimes showing that royal favor was accompanied by lavish gifts (Kloth 2002: 162–173). This phenomenon is also well documented for the 18th dynasty, for example, where stressing royal favor toward the first-person speaker was one of the most frequent topics (Guksch 1994: 39–54). In addi-tion, from the Old Kingdom onward, actual letters of the king to his official frequently state that the recipient had done what the king loved and favored (Eichler 1991: 165).Another text genre revealing such conceptions is the so-called “appeals to the living” (Garnot 1938). They typically contain phrases like “as you wish that the ruler favors you,” used to interest the addressees in performing certain acts such as offering formulae for the deceased, or respecting purity regulations.Also in the “Book of the Temple,” a large manual for the ideal Egyp-tian temple (Quack 2000; Quack 2004a), we find instructions for the governor and overseer of the prophets: He should question all those who had been sent on a mission, and favor/reward (ḥsi̯) the compe-tent and successful one while condemning the incompetent one. We have to understand that “favor” in Egypt actually meant rewards for"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"64 joachim friedrich quackwell-executed missions, and was not just a question of prestige—it also had implications of direct material gains (Jansen-Winkeln 2002). The most valuable expression of this was the so-called “gold of praise” (Butterweck-AbdelRahim 2002; Binder 2008) which in its actual for-mulation (nb.w n ḥsw.t) is rather a “gold of favor”.All this should be set against the background of a royal court which was most likely a cesspool of intrigues with different factions vying for power, trying to gain royal favor and to put their adversaries in the worst possible light. It is quite instructive to see how often elite tombs, even those of persons who emphasize in their inscriptions how close they were to the king and how firmly in his favor, end up with the depictions of the tomb-owner defaced and his name erased (e.g. the tomb of Haremhab; Brack and Brack 1980: 15f.)—royal favor might be fickle and royal wrath more swift and terrible than you would like. As expressed in an Egyptian didactic text about the king: “Lo, truly great is the favor (ḥsw.t) of the god, but also great is the punishment” (Instruction of a Man for His Son § 3, 5; Fischer-Elfert 1999: 58). Such a situation may also explain why one’s own success is not really enough—being victorious over your adversaries is part of the game.This game, however, has complicated rules which do not always allow for voicing the complete story. It was never difficult to tell of one’s own success, and of having obtained favor. In contrast, it was much more problematic to speak openly about internal rivalries and conflict between factions. In the official autobiographies, decorum did not permit any private individual to mention specific enemies; this has led to a recent scholarly declaration that the Egyptians did not have enemies, only Pharaoh had (Franke 2005: 92). As a matter of fact, even in the official memorial inscriptions there is room for the negative characterization of unspecified persons (Franke 2005: 107f.), and as soon as we leave them, things look even more different. In the instructions there are several passages that mention possible antago-nisms between private individuals (for the Middle Kingdom see Quack 2005b: 75 and 79; for the New Kingdom, Quack 1994: 152 and 180–181). It is equally possible to conceptualize the victory over enemies when they are not given a specific individual name but only a general blan-ket designation, as can be seen in the rituals and greeting formulae I have discussed here. Similarly, underlying rivalries could be expressed in the tomb decoration by showing surrogate images of bulls fighting each other (Seidlmayer 1999). Numerous internal quarrels and antag-onisms come to light through actual letters (e.g. Wente 1990: p. 58"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 65no. 67; p. 92 no. 117; p. 93 no. 120; p. 115f. no. 136; p. 120–122 no. 143; p. 124–126 no. 147; p. 127–128 no. 151–152; p. 129f. no. 154; 137 no. 168; p. 140 no. 177; p. 148f. no. 203–206; p. 152f. no. 213–216; p. 172f. no. 288–289; p. 178 no. 294; p. 189f. no. 312; p. 202 no. 329). In one case we even gain the information how a conflict was settled in court by royal decision, with the winner receiving royal largesse—but his boat was spoiled by opponents (LRL 59, 4–13; Wente 1990: 175).One case might, more than anything else, illustrate the risks involved. It is the so-called “literary letter of Moscow” (Caminos 1977; Quack 2001a; Schad 2006: 63–150), a probably fictional composition pre-served in a papyrus (Moscow, Pushkin Museum 127) from about 1000 BCE. It opens with one of the longest and most elaborate forms of polite greeting attested in all Egyptian letters. Within this framework, we find the wish, “May your favor (ḥsw.t) with the king’s Ka happen to be stable” (1, 3f.). This wish, and all of the introductory section, take on a larger meaning far surpassing simple politeness when we consider the writer’s own experience. He recounts how he was ousted from office by unnamed enemies and driven to a vagabond’s life (Fischer-Elfert 2005: 215–232)—which is what can happen if your favor is not firmly settled with the king.The dichotomy of promises and threats is expressed clearly in some classes of documents. One typical section is found in donation ste-lae, especially of the Third Intermediate Period. They usually contain threats against those who have overthrown the decisions combined with promises for those who abide by them.15 A typical example is: “As for the one who will establish this decree, he will be in the favor of Amun-Re and his son will succeed him. As for the one who will dis-regard it, he will fall prey to the slaughter (š¡ṭ) of Amun-Re.” (Smaller Dakhla-stela, l. 11–13; Janssen 1968: 167). Another one is “[As for the one who will disregard the field-plots . . .] . . ., he will be in the slaughter (š¡.t) of the king, they will cut off his head . . . As for the one who will establish these field-plots and not diminish their measuring-rope, he will be in the favor of the god of his town” (Stela Cairo JdÉ 85647; Bakir 1943: 79). The threat of slaughter is very frequent in those texts (Morschauser 1991: 104–109). As the counterbalance to favor, it illus-trates very well what favor implied in Egypt.15 Morschauser 1991: 225–239 restricts himself to a presentation of the threats and thus fails to provide an adequate analysis of the complex."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"66 joachim friedrich quackFurthermore, such formulae are attested in juridical oaths, espe-cially the royal oaths attested in the Ptolemaic Period (Minas 2000: 163–171). Two typical examples demonstrate the phraseology. “[By the king] Ptolemaios, son of Ptolemaios, the god, by Arsinoe, the brother-loving [goddess], by the brother-loving gods, by the fathers and moth-ers, I will act for you according to everything which is written above, without falsehood in the oath given above. If I am doing it as perjury, I will be in the punishment of the king; if I will do it as truthful oath, I will be in the favor of the king” (pLille 117, x+7–10; de Cenival 1991: 17). “By king Ptolemaios, the mother-loving god, Isis, Oserapis and all the Gods of Egypt. We will act according to everything written above from [now on for ever.] . . . [If we will do the] royal oath given above truthfully, we are in his favor, if we do it as perjury, we are in his punishment” (pAshmolean Hawara 18, 10–12; Reymond 1973: 128f.). The word for “punishment” in these texts (btw) can often be used to mean capital punishment (Quack & Ryholt 2000: 149; Ryholt 2005: 39). As such, it is the structural continuation of the šcṭ “slaughter” we encountered in the donation stelae.The King Finding Favor with the GodsUp to now, I have mainly considered wishes for favor for the benefit of a private individual, either from the gods, the kings, or sometimes high officials. When going over to examples of the temple cult, we must also consider the king as the recipient of favor, for the simple reason that officially, the king is supposed to act in the temple liturgy; temple reliefs typically show the king, not priests, enacting the prin-cipal rituals.Actually, one of the most fundamental epithets of the king is that he is beloved of some deity (Morenz 1956; Blumenthal 1970: 67–71; Grimal 1986: 199–201; Schade-Busch 1992: 55f.). This is so ubiquitous that the sheer amount of evidence has deterred most Egyptologists from entering into a more detailed discussion. Many Pharaohs stress that the god loved them more than any previous king. Such expres-sions are an obvious transposition of the hierarchy one stage higher. Just as the functionaries were dependent on the favor and love of the king (or of their immediate superiors), thus the king himself is depen-dent equally upon the gods.A ritual act which is attested, at least during the New Kingdom, as being connected with wishes for favor from the gods, is the presen-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 67tation of the bouquet to the king (Dittmar 1986: 73 and 158–160). Relevant phrases are found especially in the tombs of high-ranking officials of the 18th dynasty. We have, for example, “For your Ka, the bouquet of your father Harakhte. . . . May he favor you, may he love you, may he make you live long, may he give you millions of years, annals and jubilees, all lands being under your soles. May he fell your enemies among the dead and the living. [All] happiness be with you, all health be with you, and all life be with you, may you remain on the throne of Re like Re in eternity” (Urk. IV 1780, 16–1781, 4); or, “For your Ka, the bouquet of your father Ptah. May he favor you, may he love you, may he make you live long, may your enemy among the dead and the living be felled!” (Urk. IV 1936, 7–13). Such texts show a rather stock formula in a probably frequent ritual setting. This set-ting can actually be identified because in the offering ritual of the New Kingdom (Tacke 2003), there is a scene of presenting a bouquet to the king on the sixth day of the lunar month (pChester Beatty IX rt. 14, 8–11). As so often in the material I am presenting, being in favor is combined with the downfall of enemies. There are late period adapta-tions of such formulae in the temple of Edfu where they are rewritten for the benefit of the living sacred animal of Horus (Edfou VI, 271, 5f.; 272, 11f.). One of them is especially remarkable as it combines the favor and the overthrowing of the enemies with the fact that the beneficiary will gain renown with men and love with women (Edfou VI, 272, 12).The combination of the roots ḥsi̯ “to praise” and mri̯ “to love” can be traced back to the liturgy of the daily ritual from the New Kingdom onward. There it is found in many cases, especially in connection with incense and libations (Egberts 1995: 119).A formula of protection has also crept into one spell of the daily temple ritual, as demonstrated in a manuscript from the Roman Period (PSI Inv. I 70, A 1, 11) (Osing & Rosati 1998: 107, pl. 14), where the deity is implored at the end of a spell ḥsi̯⸗k s(ô) “may you favor it (the eye of Horus).” The spell itself, a recitation accompanying the lighting of a candle, is well attested in many versions (see e.g. Franke 1994: 224–236), but the formula of interest here seems to be an individual addition.Equally, several attestations among the offering scenes of the Graeco-Roman temples are relevant. In them, the basic situation is always that of the king sacrificing to the gods and receiving gifts from them. Con-sequently, the wishes for favor are always formulated in his interest."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"68 joachim friedrich quackEspecially frequent are relevant formulae within the scenes for offer-ing the mnw-jar, a vessel containing an intoxicating beverage (Stern-berg-el Hotabi 1992; Quack 2001b). There, Pharaoh is promised by the goddess that she will place his favor in the heart of the gods, and love for him in the heart of men. One scene combining the menu-vase and incense has the promise of the goddess: “I will place your favor in the hearts of the gods, and I will make the hearts of men inclined toward you” (Dendera VI, 26, 14–27, 1).Finding Favor in Demotic Magical TextsAll these earlier examples from a variety of sources provide the neces-sary background for understanding the Late-Antique texts generally understood as “magical,” in which highly elaborate procedures for ensuring favor and love for an individual are sometimes transmitted.First, I will discuss the demotic attestations (mainly from the 3rd century CE) which strongly resemble the Greek charitesia. The demotic linguistic equivalent of the charitesion can be determined fairly easily because this genre of spells occurs in the great magical papyrus of Lon-don and Leiden (Griffith & Thompson 1904–1909), and is obviously related to the similar Greek-language spells. The keywords are indeed ḥsi̯.t “favor” and mri̯.t “love”.Highly important is a spell for bestowing favor, entitled as such in the manuscript (pMag. LL. 11, 1–26). Perhaps the most remarkable part of the spell is its postscript, which I shall discuss first. This states that the spell is the scribe’s feat of a king whose name is unfortunately largely lost due to a lacuna in the manuscript. The remaining traces only show that the last phonetic sign was an š. This is sufficient to narrow the perspective considerably. Of all the Egyptian kings, only the names of some foreign rulers end with this sound: the Persians Dareios, Xerxes and Artaxerxes as well as an obscure king Khababash who seems to have ruled Egypt for a short time in the fourth cen-tury BCE. Also, there is the option that the name could be restored as Necho with the epithet p# šš, an epithet which has recently been identified as being specific for Necho II (the Nekhepso(s) of astro-logical traditions). This note would thus give the spell a pre-Ptolemaic origin. Obviously, we cannot simply take this at face value, but lin-guistic arguments are of importance here. In general, the manuscript in question shows a developed form of Late Demotic already quite"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 69close to Coptic; the passage in question, however, mostly eschews the linguistic innovations of the contemporary speech and rather shows a sort of standard Middle Demotic (Quack 2006c). All told, I would be inclined to suppose a fairly early origin for the spell in question, especially since none of the possible kings (except perhaps Necho II) would be an obvious choice for pseudepigraphic attribution.The principal deity invoked in the spell is Thot, and the speaker first presents himself as a baboon, the sacred animal of that very god. Fur-thermore, he claims identification with a rather large number of other Egyptian gods. All of them fall squarely within the traditional Egyptian religion, with no obvious foreign elements present—which is actually quite rare in this manuscript and would serve as a further indicator of the relatively old age of the composition.The link with Thot is further strengthened by the fact that in the manual rite, an actual figurine of a baboon is to be produced in red wax. This is anointed with lotus oil or alternatively other sorts of oint-ment; styrax, myrrh and the seed of a plant called “great of love” are added and the whole is placed into a faience vessel. In addition, a wreath is brought and anointed before pronouncing the spells. The face of the petitioner is to be anointed with this specific ointment, and he takes the wreath in his hand. He can then walk wherever he wishes among the multitude, and is given very great favor among them. Obvi-ously, the manual rite chooses appropriate symbolism; for the wreath can easily be understood as the Egyptian crown of justification (Der-chain 1955), and thus prefigures the successful outcome of any critical encounter at court or in the royal audience-chamber. This text is of completely Egyptian composition, with no Greek or Mesopotamian elements present.A sample passage from the actual wishes is, “Grant me favor (ḥsi̯(.t)), love (mri̯.t) [and reverence before NN whom] NN [has born] today, and he may give me every good thing, and he may give me nour-ishment and food, and he may do for me everything which I [want, and he should not] injure me so as to harm me, and he may not say anything which I hate today, tonight, this month, this year, in [every] hour [of my life (?). But as for the enemies], the sun-god shall impede their hearts, blind their eyes, and cause the darkness to be in their faces” (11, 9–12).The final prayer is: “Oh all you gods [whose names I have spoken] here today, come to me in order that you might hear what I have"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"70 joachim friedrich quacksaid today and in order that you might rescue me from all weakness, every defect, everything, every evil today! Grant me favor (ḥsi̯(.t)), love (mri̯(.t)) and reve[rence (šfe.t) before] the woman NN, the king and his people, the mountain and its animals (?), so that he does every-thing which I shall say to him [together with every man who will se]e me (or) to whom I shall speak (or) who will speak to me from among all men, all women, all youths, all old people, all people [or animals or things in the] whole land, [who] shall see me in these hours today so that they create my praise (ḥsi̯(.t)) in their hearts in everything which I will [do] daily, together with those who will come to me in order to overthrow every enemy!” (11, 16–20).This composition obviously continues the tradition of rituals for gaining favor and overcoming rivals, with the antagonistic stance clearly present. The first prayer is even quite specific insofar as it seems to intend the position of a favored client to a great patron for the beneficiary of the ritual.Much shorter is another recipe in the same text. In the main part, this is a straightforward love-charm making use of body-parts of a shrew-mouse. But the same text also contains a short note that the heart of the animal, set into a ring, would bring great praise (ḥsi̯.t c¡.t), love (mri̯.t) and respect (šfe.t) to the bearer (pMag LL 13, 21; better preserved vs. 32, 12–13). Such a muddling of the border between spells for favor before the king and officials, and private love charms, is con-sistent with what we know from the Greek papyri. Due to the purely technical description which is devoid of any mythological allusions or actual incantations, I would be reluctant to state an opinion regarding the ultimate cultural affiliations of this recipe. I can, however, note that the shrew-mouse is an animal of real religious significance in Egypt. It can be linked with a specific form of Horus, namely the one from Letopolis (Brunner-Traut 1965).A relatively short recipe for gaining favor (ḥsi̯.t) and love (mri̯.t) is preserved in pBM 10588 rt. 7, 1–5 (Bell, Nock and Thompson 1933: 9 and 12; Ritner 1986: 98f.). It is indicated as being in the Nubian language, although no linguistic analysis of such terms has yet been published, and some words give the impression of being based on a Greek model—for example, having Abrasax as magical name (Quack 2004b: 447). The instructions for the actual performance are in clear Demotic: You should put gum into your hand and kiss (or spit?) on your shoulders before confronting whomever you wish. The fact that the target person is a man (rmč), not specifically a woman, should be"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 71regarded as a strong indication that this spell concerns social success, not love magic.Since in the Greek tradition, spells for currying favor frequently go hand-in-hand with those for gaining the love of a woman, it seems appropriate to discuss here two fairly important love spells with com-plicated manual rites, both transmitted in the demotic magical Papy-rus of London and Leiden. They are of special interest since they both make use of a magically enhanced oil with which the face and phal-lus of the practitioner are to be anointed, and thus belong to a field for which Faraone has indicated only Greek and Mesopotamian cases. Actually, they are two divergent versions of a single ritual, with differ-ences mainly in the exact wording of the invocations. The oil is pre-pared over a period of time lasting from the end of one lunar month to the next full moon, by being dripped off a fish, being collected in a vessel, and formulae being recited over it. The practitioner identifies himself mainly with Shu and a female entity (perhaps the fish) with the uraeus-goddess, also called Nubian cat, the daughter of Re. Thus the magical precedent used is the love of Shu and Tefnut, a traditional Egyptian mythological theme which, to give an additional dimension to the composition, is normally connected to the theme of those two coming to help their father and overthrowing his enemies (Sternberg 1985: 224–227). In one of the two variants, the invocation actually alludes to this by saying: “You are Sakhmet, the great, lady of Ast who has overcome every rebel” (pMag. LL 12, 22–23).The first one has a fragmentary title probably to be restored as “[a spell to make a woman] love a man.” Even though this makes it sound like a simple love-spell, the actual invocation-prayer says: “Give me favor (ḥs.t), love (mri̯.t) and respect (šfe.t) before every womb and every woman” (12, 17–18). The second is entitled: “Another way to give a man favor (ḥsi̯.t) before a woman.” (12, 21), which makes it even more into a charitesion. In any case, they show that already within the Egyptian tradition, there were cases where this type of spell was used for love magic, and not only for career-related questions; but the choice of mythological analogy still links it subtly with the spells where social success is connected with the victory over enemies.For a complete understanding, it should be pointed out that magical prayers for favor are not confined to spells which identify themselves as charitesia in the title; they also occur within the body of quite dif-ferent genres. One remarkable case is the “vessel inquiry of Chons” (pMag. LL 9, 1–10, 22). While the later parts of the text are quite"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"72 joachim friedrich quacknormal for such a genre, the beginning is different. It sets out by pre-senting the esoteric knowledge of the practitioner who is well versed with the sacred minutiae of the deity he invokes: he gives a lot of specific names, as well as the natural phenomena—animal, celestial orbit, snake, tree, bird, stone—connected with it. Then he says: “I have done it [because of (?) hung]er for bread, thirst for water, and you will protect me, and you will keep me safe, and you will give me favor (ḥsi̯(.t)), love (mri̯(.t)) and renown (šf #.t) before all men” (9, 11f.)—followed by a long list of self-identifications serving to justify the claim for divine help. Afterward, another request follows: “Save me before every [ . . .], every place of turmoil, Lasmatnout, Lasmatot, protect me, keep me safe, give me favor (ḥsi̯(.t)), love (mri̯(.t)) and renown (šfe #.t) in my vessel [and in] my wick here today”—and that leads to a normal request for telling the truth without falsehood concerning the actual affair. The second request is thus the hinge allowing one type of magi-cal practice to be adapted to the aims of another, quite different one. It should be stressed that this particular magical practice is not homoge-neous, since one section giving mainly Jewish or “international” magic names (10, 3–6) is stuck on to an otherwise traditional Egyptian part. The legitimization by display of knowledge is structurally very similar to some Greek charitesia I will discuss later.The Greek CharitesiaAfter discussing the Egyptian tradition, it is time to address the Greek spells and the question of their cultural affiliation (if anything certain can be said about this). Obviously, ethnicity in Graeco-Roman Egypt is a highly complicated question that can be understood on many different levels (Bilde et al. 1992; La’da 1994; La’da 2003). It is well known that many people had double names, one Egyptian and one Greek, and used them according to the needs of the situation (Clarysse 1985; Depauw 1997: 43).Juridical ethnicity is basically a question of which tax rate had to be paid for the poll tax; people considered as Egyptians were more harshly treated than Greeks. The point here is one of having acquired Greek or even Roman citizenship at some point in the family, less about pure bloodlines.Cultural affinity is an altogether different affair, and can also be divided in divergent areas. The Greek models in literature and phi-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 73losophy had high prestige, and they would naturally have been taught to those Egyptians who wished to retain some status, since they had to learn the Greek language (and school was based on the Greek classical authors, see Cribiore 2001). Religious affiliation was quite a different matter. There, we can actually see an enormous influx of Egyptian cults into the whole Roman world. Greeks in Egypt were greatly attracted to Egyptian funerary beliefs; even among the cults for the living, the Egyptian religion normally had the upper hand. Temples for purely Greek gods were fairly rare in the Egyptian chora, even in regions where a relatively high number of Greek colonists resided.Furthermore, if we look for cultural or religious affiliation in any specific ritual—for example, as preserved in the PGM, we should be careful about understanding the drift of our own question. As modern scholars, we might say that some specific spell contains Jewish ele-ments (or are they Gnostic?), or that it is based on traditional Egyptian concepts, since we are trained to conduct research into the origins of a practice or belief system (Ritner 1998; Faraone 2005). Such ques-tions did not concern the ancient magician. He was interested in the pragmatic aim: that those rituals should work, that they should pro-duce the desired effect. He certainly did not pledge his allegiance to any single deity or pantheon by collecting only rituals based on the traditions of one specific ethnic or religious group. Typically, the large manuals (most famously, PGM IV with more than 3000 lines of text) contain many different spells which not only vary in the preference given to any specific religious tradition, but can be seen to include Egyptian deities, Jewish or “Gnostic” figures and even Greek gods (or such whose name is linguistically Greek, even if, like Hermes or Helios, in this text group they are likely to mean an Egyptian deity like Thot or Re) existing side by side in a combination which might seem incongruous to us but caused no problem at all for the actual users of these handbooks. In such a situation, inquiring about the ethnic or cultural origins of a spell might have diachronic relevance, but for the synchronic use it is utterly irrelevant. We should bear this in mind when coming to the actual examples.Instructive here is a lengthy practice in the Mimaut papyrus which is stylized as a prayer to the sun-god (PGM III 495–611). It is a fairly complex ritual which can be used for different aims. But the prayer contains elements clearly at home in the charitesion tradition. We have, for example: “Come to me with a happy face to a bed of your"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 joachim friedrich quackchoice, giving me, NN, sustenance, health, safety, wealth, the blessing of children, knowledge, a ready hearing, goodwill, sound judgment, honor, memory, grace, shapeliness, beauty to all who see me” (PGM III 575–580).The cult of the sun-god Helios as an important deity is not widespread in Greece but is obviously very much so in the Egyptian tradition. The primary magical means of rendering the deity propitious is by demon-strating knowledge of its different forms and symbols, as we have seen in the Demotic vessel inquiry of Chons. This is done specifically by enumerating the different forms of the sun-god in the different hours, as well as its specific favorite trees, stones, birds, animals and sacred names. This resembles the Egyptian tradition of having different forms of the sun-god in the different hours of the day. We can even go one step further. The specific forms of the sun-god evoked in this papyrus are familiar from other traditions. They correspond to a set known as dodekaoros (von Lieven, in press), even though the sequence seems confused in comparison with other attestations (Gundel 1968: 6). The dodekaoros can be recognized as a late-Egyptian conception. It is known from magical manuscripts of Roman-period Egypt, from actual depictions of the animals on a zodiac found in Egypt, and from astrological treatises giving its constituents as parts of the non-Greek constellations.The Egyptian background is strengthened by the fact that this prayer ends with a famous text, the hymnic conclusion of the hermetic “Per-fect Discourse” (teleios logos) which is mainly known from the Latin translation in the treatise Asclepius, as well as a Coptic version pre-served among the Nag-Hammadi-codices (Nock & Festugière 1946: 353–355; Mahé 1978: 160–167).Quite similar in some basic structures is the consecration of a stone in PGM IV 1596–1715. We have a prayer to the sun-god: “Give glory and honor and favor and fortune and power to this NN stone which I consecrate today.” Here also, the different shapes of the sun-god according to the dodekaoros are fundamental. Again, we are very much in an Egyptian setting, and the concluding sentence “When you complete the consecration, say ‘One is Zeus and Sarapis’,” again illus-trates the Graeco-Egyptian cultural horizon of the practitioner.Equally, a binding love spell of Astrapsoukhos (PGM VIII 1–63) has some structural similarities to the two compositions I have just discussed. The crucial prayer is: “Give me favor, sustenance, victory, prosperity, elegance, beauty of face, strength of all men and women.”"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 75Again, knowledge of the names and shapes of the god is the essen-tial justification of the practitioner. Here, the spectrum is reduced to four different animals in the cardinal regions of the sky: in the east an ibis, in the west a dog-faced baboon, in the north a serpent, and in the south a wolf. All of those animals are familiar in the Egyptian religious bestiary—the wolf is of course a sort of jackal in the same way as the cult-place of Upuaut is called Lykopolis by the Greeks. The deity invoked is itself identified as Hermes, which fits very well with animals such as the ibis and the baboon which are sacred to Thot. In addition, the analogy of Isis is presented, who invoked the god at a time of crisis. Of some interest is a specific section in the spell: “May you save me in eternity from poison and malice and all calumniation and evil tongues, from every hatred of gods and men. They shall give me favor and victory and success and prosperity. For you are me and I am you, your name is mine and mine yours, for I am your image. If anything happens to me in this year or this month or this day or this hour, then it will happen to the great god Akhkhemen Estroph whose name is carved on the prow of the sacred ship” (PGM VIII 32–41). This incantation shows close similarities to Egyptian spells, as I have demonstrated elsewhere (Quack 2006a: 61f.). Affirming the fundamental identity of the speaker (or recipient) with the god is quite typical. Again, this is one of the PGM spells with a particularly strong and undiluted Egyptian character. Note that possible actions of antag-onists are treated in detail, like in several of the earlier Egyptian cases I have cited.Quite remarkable also are two spells for the consecration of a ring (PGM XII 201–69 and 270–350). This begins with the fact that although the language of the spells itself is Greek, the actual title, “A ring,” is written in Demotic. One of the consecrations is given the name of Ouphor, and this is likely to be a phonetic rendering of the Egyptian word wpi̯.t-r\" “opening of the mouth,” a ritual actually used for consecrating objects produced by handcraft, and even attested for a ring-stone with a scarab within the Egyptian documentation (Moyer & Dieleman 2003; Quack 2006b: 144f.). The Egyptian elements in the spells are quite clear, even though some elements of obvious Jew-ish or Greek derivation are present—it is after all a good example of the intermingling of magical traditions so typical of Roman-period Egypt. Some segments, like an invocation beginning with the phrases “the gates of heaven were opened, the gates of earth were opened” (PGM XII, 323) sound exactly like Egyptian cultic language (Moyer"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"76 joachim friedrich quackand Dieleman 2003: 63–66; Dieleman 2005: 175–182) and might even derive from the canonical Egyptian Ritual of Opening the Mouth (Quack 2006b:145). The text certainly cannot simply be cited as an example of a Greek practice similar to an Assyrian one, as claimed by Faraone (1999: 103).There is one spell for favor (PGM XXXV) that seems to have a mainly Jewish background. None of the mythology is Egyptian, whereas invo-cations of the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are prominent. The charitesion indicated in PGM VII 186–190 is too short and too exclu-sively focused on the technical side to provide much of interest for my enquiry. For lack of space, I will also refrain from discussing the pas-sages PGM IV 2373–2440; 3125–71 and XII 99–106 which deal mainly with success in business,16 as well as the truncated and untitled section PGM XII 182–189 which is recognisably a charitesion according to its first sentence.Faraone had noted that the practice of anointing the face with oil can be paralleled in neo-Assyrian texts, and he produced several texts showing that anointment for similar purposes was known in Greece (Faraone 1999: 105–106). This line of argumentation seems insuffi-cient to me. Obviously, anointing yourself as part of a process aiming at making you attractive—especially if the oil is scented with some plants—is almost a universal practice; at least it is so frequent that no conclusions on ethnic affiliations of magical practices can be drawn from it. Instead, we have to look much more closely at the details of the individual rites, and these are quite telling.The first spell Faraone cites is a prayer to the sun-god as a charm to restrain anger and for securing favor (PGM XXXVI, 211–230). It contains a phrase, “I ask to obtain and receive from you life, health, reputation, wealth, influence, strength, success, charm, favor with all men and all women, victory over all men and all women.”In my opinion, the text is difficult to attribute to any specific cul-ture in itself, because it is relatively short and does not contain many elements of clear-cut affiliation, although among the magical names, forms such as Harponkhnouphi and Niptoumi point to Egypt. In any case, it is a shorter example of what is shown in much more detail in 16 For this, the section about the dendrachate in the orphic kerygmata with an engraving of clear Egyptian origin (Hermes with a book accompanied by a dog-headed ape) should be compared (Halleux and Schamp 1985: 148f.)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 77the Mimaut papyrus, and thus is unlikely to come from a totally differ-ent background. The long sequence of blessings which the practitioner requests sounds quite a bit like a typical Egyptian enumeration begin-ning with the basic elements ¡nḫ “life” and snb “health.”Even more telling is Faraone’s second example. There, ointment of myrrh is used, and the charm is, “You are the myrrh with which Isis has anointed herself when she went to the bosom of Osiris, her own husband and brother, and on that day you gave her charm” (SM 72, 2, 4–8). Faraone admits “the influence of a popular Isis and Osiris leg-end” but supposes nevertheless simply that this was a Greek technique (Faraone 1999: 105). The papyrus manual from which this text is taken proclaims itself to be a translation of a book found in Heliopolis, writ-ten in Egyptian letters and then translated into Greek. With the pos-sible exception of one charm in it concerning the use of apples in love magic,17 there is nothing in the actual wording of the papyrus which would run counter to a real Egyptian origin.Regarding the passage about the consecration of magical rings (PGM XII, 270–350), I have already commented on it above. Furthermore, it is problematic to cite the Cyranides concerning magical rings in order to establish an unbroken chain of Greek traditions, as does Faraone. The Cyranides are regarded as a 4th-century Alexandrian composition (Alpers 1984), and they are so much in the tradition of the interna-tional Graeco-Roman magic and amulets (Waegeman 1987) that they can hardly be claimed as evidence of undoubtedly Greek traditions.Rings for gaining friendship, favor and affection are attested in sev-eral other treatises on stones and their use in rings. The orphic poem on stones and the kerygmata indicate that the Galaktites should be worn when approaching rulers in order to render them propitious and inclined to forget your faults (Halleux and Schamp 1985: 92 and 147), and Damigeron and Evax also stress their use for making the porter agreeable (ibid. 274). Agate is supposed to be effective for procuring love and rendering people well-inclined in social contacts (ibid. 115 and 163f.). In the book on stones by Socrates and Dionysus, the emer-ald is said to possess great virtues for currying favor and procuring success. The engraving should be a figure of Isis, which stresses the Egyptian background (ibid. 166). Similar powers are also attributed to the chalcedon (ibid. 167), Babylonian stone (ibid. 168), some sort of 17 Even for this, pMag. LL. 15, 21–23 provides a parallel in the Egyptian language."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"78 joachim friedrich quackonyx (ibid. 170), opal (ibid. 171), agate (ibid. 172 and 255), sard-agate (ibid. 173), swallow-stones (ibid. 174f.), cock-stone (ibid. 257), stone of the Syrte (ibid. 262), topaz (ibid. 268), chrysolite (ibid. 282). Many more descriptions of the magical properties of stones go at least some way in this direction, multi-purpose use being a characteristic of many of the supposedly more powerful stones. The manuals in question seem to be mainly a product of an international culture of the Roman Imperial period, with at least some admixture of Egyptian elements. One such example occurs in the so-called “Graeco-Judaic decan book” concerning the second decan of Leo, again using agate (Gundel 1936: 388). This text has some Egyptian background in using the astrological concept of the decans, but otherwise is rather international, with the exact origins difficult to pinpoint.I do not claim any Egyptian influence on the Homeric scene (although I feel equally skeptical about the supposed Mesopotamian influence). Equally, the idea of using spells for currying favor and gaining love and affection is, in itself, certainly too basic and too eas-ily conditioned by the social constraints of many ancient (and mod-ern) cultures to be attributable to any specific culture from which it developed exclusively and was taken over by others. However, the PGM instances can certainly not be read as part of one long and only partially visible Greek tradition; the technique of the charitesion in them clearly follows models present in Egypt, and most of the specific invocations are based more on Egyptian religious concepts than on any others.In conclusion, Faraone’s principal methodological weakness is that he based his conclusions on very broad similarities, often no more than a technique as such, without paying attention to the question whether such a technique was in any way likely to be specific enough for attribution to any single culture. We should recognize that many of the aims in magical spells have their roots in the general cultural structures of traditional societies; for example, wishes for healing are ubiquitous, and charms for favor come up naturally in every society where different rivaling members vie for the attention of the leader. I have tried to indicate how deeply rooted such concerns were within the Egyptian culture, without wishing in any way to imply that it would be the only one to develop such usages, or be predominant in it.Equally, some of the techniques employed are not very useful as an indicator of the ethnic or cultural origin of a practice. In particular, procedures such as putting on ornaments and embellishments, such as"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" from ritual to magic 79textile straps, are quite natural ways of promoting attention and desire; and nobody would claim that today’s sexy women’s underwear derives from Assyrian practices.Only a really close analysis of each individual text can produce reliable results. For the charitesion, we can at least say that there are good precedents for it in Egyptian texts, and that most of the lon-ger examples from the Roman-period manuals in the Greek language show quite strong signs of Egyptian background.BibliographyAlpers, K. 1984. “Untersuchungen zum griechischen Physiologus und den Kyraniden,” Vestigia Bibliae 6: 13–87.Assmann, J. 1979. “Weisheit, Loyalismus und Frömmigkeit,” in: E.

These scribal conventions concern visual reading aids, controlled vocabulary and fixed text formats. I argue first that these genre rules were clear-cut and remained unchanged for the entire period that hieratic formularies were produced, and second, that some recipes in the Demotic magic handbooks continue these rules, whereas others deviate from them. This second observation has a bearing on the ongoing debate about the cultural, intellectual and institutional roots of Greco-Egyptian magic in general and the Demotic magical papyri in particular. Given the overall application of the traditional scribal conventions in the Demotic recipes, it seems warranted to conclude that the Demotic formularies were written, edited and copied by scribes who had been trained and worked in an Egyptian temple scriptorium, the institution where hieratic formular-ies had been produced since at least as early as the Middle Kingdom (ca. 1975–1640 BCE). However, given the longevity and stability of these scribal conventions, the deviations in the Demotic recipes, no matter how small or irrelevant at first sight, are significant and beg to be addressed. Did they result from internal changes in the curriculum and practices in the temple schools and scriptoria? Or are they a reflec-tion of new procedures and protocols developed outside the temple * I thank Ra’anan Boustan, Friedhelm Hoffmann and Elizabeth Waraksa for read-ing and commenting on earlier drafts of this article. I also thank Kim Ryholt for his invitation to present these ideas at the University of Copenhagen in April 2008 and, last but not least, Jennifer Cromwell and Eitan Grossman for their invitation to dis-cuss this paper at the conference “Beyond Free-Variation: Scribal Repertoires in Egypt from the Old Kingdom to the Early Islamic Period” in Oxford in September 2009.

Too often scholars refer to the Leiden manuscripts with the capital letter J, e.g. P. Leiden J 384, in spite of the fact that this letter designation does not exist. It is merely a persistent typographical error. The proper letter designation is I—i.e., the capital i. For an explanation of the system of inventory numbers, see Maarten J.

The evident associa-tion with the Greek Magical Papyri is further borne out by the fact that two of the Theban Demotic magical manuscripts, and possibly four of them, were discovered as part of a larger collection of magical and alchemical handbooks in Greek, commonly called the Theban Magical Library, in the hills of Luxor (ancient Thebes) in or somewhat earlier than 1828. The Greek magical manuals of this ancient cache are nowa-days counted as the most important and extensive manuals among the Greek Magical Papyri.The Demotic manuals are thus not only chronologically and themat-ically, but also archaeologically, related to the Greek Magical Papyri. It would, however, be wrong to equate the two corpora, as if the one were nothing but the other in a different language. As I have tried to show in a previous investigation, the use of language and script in the Demotic manuals is quite different from that which we find in the Greek handbooks, which suggests that the Demotic manuals were produced for a different group of consumers—that is to say, for users who had undergone a rigorous Egyptian scribal training in addition to having mastered Greek. The Greek and Demotic manuals are thus different, yet very similar: they are both testimonies, each in its own way, to one and the same flourishing culture of Greco-Egyptian magic in the Roman period.Egyptian formularies for healing and protectionIn ancient Egypt, healers and ritual specialists made use of handbooks with practical instructions for treating ailments and injuries and for preparing amulets. Several dozen of such manuals have been pre-served, attesting to a long-standing, indigenous tradition of collecting, archiving and applying specialized skills and knowledge in an attempt to overcome and anticipate impotence in situations of life crises.5 The earliest of the extant documents date to the middle of the Middle 5 Egyptologists traditionally distinguish between medical and magical handbooks, although there are no formal, ancient Egyptian criteria to support this distinction; see further below in this article.

The king then orders the bringing of a chest with scrolls, by which undoubtedly handbooks for healing are meant. The tradition continued well into the Roman period, as the second century CE formularies from the temple libraries of Tebtunis, Soknopaiou Nesos and Crocodilopolis in the Fayum demonstrate.7 As will be shown in the remainder of this article, the Demotic magical papyri are perhaps best regarded as the latest representatives of this pharaonic tradition.The handbooks are compendiums of recipes that instruct a practi-tioner in how to prepare and administer a medicament, how to per-form a healing rite and how to produce an amulet. A few specialized manuals for healing, such as the Lahun Veterinary and Gynecological Papyri and the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, are organized as col-lections of case studies (šs ¡w) of ailments and injuries. In these manu-scripts, each individual text carefully describes the symptoms and the procedures of examination, explicates the diagnosis and prognosis, and gives the appropriate treatment.8 In such cases, the recipe proper is contained in the section on the treatment. However, the majority of manuals are collections of recipes only, taking the stages of examina-tion, diagnosis and prognosis for granted. The recipe’s title is assumed Magical Texts (NISABA 9; Leiden, 1978) and Hans-W.

A typical recipe informs the reader about the required materials, their quantities and measures, the ritual implements, the wording of the incantation, and explains, in brief, which actions are to be performed at which moment. Recipes are often listed themati-cally according to symptom, ailment and body part, although certain manuals, or sections thereof, seem to be without order.The manuals are the product of a scribal tradition that was institu-tionalized in the temple scriptorium and maintained for more than two millennia through formal training in an apprenticeship setting. This institution knew a limited set of rules and practices as regards the production of manuscripts. These conventions concern the use of jargon and fixed phrases, ways of glossing and commenting, the use of black and red ink, and the relative sequencing of text units. They assisted the scribes in formulating an intricate set of actions in an easy to follow, step-by-step procedure. Accordingly, they also helped the reader retrieving the information quickly and without mistakes. It is important to stress that these principles were not affected by the choice of language and script. The great majority of manuals are written in Middle or Late Middle Egyptian. However, those of the New Kingdom display a fair amount of Late Egyptianisms and, in the Greco-Roman Period, formularies were also produced in Demotic. As regards the script, two of the earliest manuals, the Lahun Veterinary Papyrus and pRamesseum V (inscribed ca. 1850 BCE), are written in cursive hiero-glyphs arranged in narrow, vertical lines separated by margin lines that are to be read in retrograde, with the title for each recipe written on a horizontal line above the entire body of the text. This layout is in line with that of liturgical handbooks of similar date, such as the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus, the Ramesseum Funerary Liturgy and the Hymns to Sobek, all of which were found as part of the so-called Ramesseum library.9 However, this early layout disappeared in the course of the Middle Kingdom and was replaced by handbooks in the less formal hieratic with the text written first in vertical lines, but soon 9 The official excavation report of this “library” is J. E. Quibell, The Ramesseum (ERA 2; London, 1898), 1–21, plates 1–30A. The tomb’s contents are most conve-niently listed and discussed in Joachim Friedrich Quack, “Zur Lesung und Deutung des Dramatischen Ramesseumpapyrus,” ZÄS 133 (2006): 72–89, 72–77. See also R. B. Parkinson, The Tale of the Eloquent Peasant (Oxford, 1991), xi–xiii; Ritner, Mechanics, 223–32; Ludwig D.

This layout was retained until the end of the Roman period, even in manuscripts writ-ten in Demotic, although double ruled lines were introduced in the Roman period to separate the columns.10The formal features listed above enabled scribes to organize the information in a methodical and consistent way.11 A recipe’s structure was visually defined through the use of red ink to highlight or set apart certain key words, opening phrases or self-contained sections from the main body of text, which was written in black ink. For example, the title, the numbers and measures, separation marks, and corrections or additions could be written in red ink; occasionally, the entire text of the directions for use or the incantation was rubricized.12 In addition to this visual device, controlled vocabulary and relative sequencing of text units were further means to structure and control the infor-mation flow. These discursive reading aids deserve our closest atten-tion, because a recipe’s text format—i.e. the key words used and the sequence of its text units—was relative to its purpose.Text formats in Egyptian formulariesThe recipes in the formularies for healing and protection of the Middle and New Kingdoms can be divided into those that take as their focal point the preparation of a substance, which is always to be applied to a patient’s body, either externally or internally, and those that take an incantation as their point of departure. The scribes thus defined each recipe as one or the other by the appropriate keyword in its title. This keyword is always found at the head of the recipe and is usually writ-ten in red ink to set it apart from the main body of text, which was 10 W. J. Tait, “Guidelines and Borders in Demotic Papyri,” in M. L. Bierbrier (ed.), Papyrus, Structure and Usage (British Museum Occasional Paper 60; London, 1986), 63–89. Double ruled lines are now attested as early as the Augustan period; Friedhelm Hoffmann, “Die Hymnensammlung des P. Wien D6951,” in Kim Ryholt (ed.), Acts of the Seventh International Conference of Demotic Studies (CNI Publications 27; Copen-hagen, 2002), 219–28, 219. 11 A very useful survey of structuring devices in Egyptian manuscripts is Richard Parkinson and Stephen Quirke, Papyrus (London, 1995), 38–48.12 This practical usage is to be distinguished from the custom of writing certain ominous words and names in red ink. The latter is to be understood in the light of the symbolic properties of the color red; most recently, Geraldine Pinch, “Red Things: the Symbolism of Colour in Magic,” in: W. V. Davies (ed.), Colour and Painting in Ancient Egypt (London, 2001), 182–85, esp. 84."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"92  jacco  dielemanwritten in black ink. Recipes of the first type have the generic term for substance ph̠rt (prescription, medicament), or occasionally zpw (rem-edy; plural of zp “deed”), as their key word.13 These recipes give direc-tions for preparing and applying drugs, potions, ointments, bandages, etc. At times a more specific heading such as gsw (ointment) or k¡pt (fumigation) is used, but the general heading was definitely preferred. Recipes of the second type are entitled r¡ (utterance, incantation) or šnt (conjuration), rarely md̠¡t (book, written charm).14In modern scholarship, the former group has been viewed as rep-resenting a tradition of ancient Egyptian curative therapy that takes recourse to more or less rational methods to diagnose and treat dis-eases and injuries, and has been distinguished from, and valued over, the latter, which relies on the spoken word and persuasive analogy as a means to heal or protect a patient.15 The former was therefore designated as representative of Egyptian medicine, whereas the other was relegated to the margin of scholarly interest as belonging to the domain of magical practices and superstition. However, as a result of closer inspection of ancient Egyptian vocabulary and practices of heal-ing, this view has now been abandoned and most scholars agree that the ancient practitioners themselves made no such distinction. Rather, they considered incantations addressed to demons that bring disease into the body and substances applied to a wound or ailing body part to be complementary methods toward the same goal.1613 For a useful discussion and list of occurrences, see Wörterbuch der medizinischen Texte, 284–91 (ph̠rt) and 736f (zpw). For ph̠rt, see also Ritner, Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice, 54–67. The other keywords mentioned in this paragraph can also be found in the Wörterbuch der medizinischen Texte.14 For more details, see Ritner, Mechanics, 41–44; md̠¡t is not discussed in his book. The common translation “chapter” for r¡ (e.g in the Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead) is unnecessarily misleading and is not retained in this article. 15 See footnote 5 of the present article.16 The debate over whether or not to recognize medicine and magic as two separate branches of thought and action in ancient Egypt has produced a large body of sec-ondary literature. I refer the reader to Geraldine Pinch, Magic in Ancient Egypt (2nd edition; London, 2006), 133–46 for a useful summary with relevant references. For scholars who convincingly argue against recognizing this distinction, see J. Walker, “The Place of Magic in the Practice of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,” BACE 1 (1990): 85–95; Joachim Friedrich Quack, “Review of Westendorf, Handbuch der altägyp-tischen Medizin,” OLZ 94 (1999): 455–62; Christian Leitz, “Die Rolle von Religion und Naturbeobachtung bei der Auswahl der Drogen im Papyrus Ebers,” in Hans-Werner Fischer-Elfert (ed.), Papyrus Ebers und die antike Heilkunde (Philippika Marburger altertumskundliche Abhandlungen 7; Wiesbaden, 2005), 41–62."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" scribal practices in egypt 93It must therefore be stressed that the first type of recipe does not exclude the inclusion of a magical incantation, and that the second is often accompanied by directions to prepare a substance or implement of some sort.17 The distinction between the two is a matter of empha-sis, either on the substance or on the incantation, and not an essential difference in thought and action. It is at times difficult, if not impos-sible, to discern what made the scribe decide to choose the substance over the incantation and vice versa when he set out to compose a new recipe. From a scribal point of view this decision was not without con-sequence, as it strictly determined the recipe’s text format, and thus had to be consciously made beforehand.Recipes of the “substance” type start with a title, which contains the keyword and a succinct explanation of the recipe’s purpose.18 For example, recipes to relieve stomach aches can be entitled “prescrip-tion (ph̠rt) for causing the belly to open (itself )” or “remedy (zpw) for opening the belly” (Ebers 34 and 7 [= H 58]). If the recipe is part of a sequence of recipes concerned with the same ailment, the title is usu-ally abbreviated to the keyword “another” (kt), whose feminine gram-matical gender indicates that it substitutes for “prescription” (ph̠rt). In a few cases the keyword may even have been dropped altogether, thereby resulting in abbreviated headings such as “killing tapeworm” (Ebers 50). Immediately following the title, the ingredients are given, often presented in a list with their required numbers and measures. Finally, the directions for use are given. In cases when the preparation or administration of the medicament was to be accompanied by an incantation, the incantation’s wording is given as the fourth section of the recipe, usually introduced by the clause “what is to be said as magic (ḥk¡w- hekau) to it.”To illustrate the standard text format of the first type, two recipes are given below.

Note that in the second example the incantation, though com-ing only at the end, is actually the longest text unit of the recipe. This demonstrates that the text format’s sequence is not established by the number of words of the individual text units, but by the keyword.[title] To drive out the ≠¡≠ poison of a god or a dead person from the belly of a man or a woman.[ingredients] Acacia leaf, 1/32 dja; arw tree leaf, 1/32 dja; qaa fruits of the arw tree, 1/32 dja; pulp of the carob fruit20 1/8 dja; grapes, 1/8 dja; Lower Egyptian salt, 1/32 dja; the kernel of a mussel, 1/32 dja; tehua, 1/8 dja; galena, 1/64 dja; shasha fruit, 1 dja; hair-of-the-earth fruit, 1/8 dja; honey, 1/32 dja; plant slime, 5 dja.[directions for use] To be cooked and sieved.

Unlike the former type, the ingredients are not listed as a separate text unit, but rather are most often integrated with the text of the directions for use.

Compared to the language used in the incantations, which can be convoluted at times and displays a wide range of varia-tion in syntactical patterns, the language of the directions for use is very straightforward and uniform. The practitioner is informed about the required procedures with a sequence of laconic sentences that often consist of nothing more than a verb and an adverbial phrase to indicate what to do in which way. The verb form used most often is the so-called passive sd̠m=f with optative mood; also very common is the stative verb form with optative mood.29The genre conventions I have described above apply to recipes written in Middle and Late Middle Egyptian. They remained in force for the entire period that the scribes in the temple scriptoria copied, edited and composed formularies in hieratic. They can, for example, be observed in the Brooklyn Snake Book (pBrooklyn 47.218.48 and 85), which dates to ca. 600 BCE, and on Papyrus Rubensohn, a fragment of a medical handbook dating to the 4th century BCE. Unfortunately, for the Greco-Roman Period, formularies in hieratic are not available for study, because they have not been preserved or not yet been identified in the papyrological collections. Circumstantial evidence is provided by Papyrus BM 10808 of the 2nd century CE, which is a collection of three fever spells written in a form of Late Middle Egyptian and tran-scribed into a Greco-Egyptian alphabetic script. Although this is not a hieratic formulary in the technical sense, it is clear that the extant version was transcribed or reworked from a hieratic original. As was the custom since at least the second millennium BCE, the complex wording of the three incantations is followed by the succinct direc-tions for use at the end of the text.29 For a detailed discussion of the use of these two verb forms in the prescrip-tions of the medical papyri, see Wolfhart Westendorf, Grammatik der medizinischen Texte (Grundriss der Medizin der Alten Ägypter VIII; Berlin, 1962), 127ff. and 180ff. According to Westendorf, the stative is used for verbs that concern the preparation of the medicament, whereas the passive sd̠m=f is used for those that concern the applica-tion. A grammatical study of this kind remains to be done for the corpus of magical papyri, but its outcome is unlikely to be very different."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"98  jacco  dielemanContinuity and innovation in the Demotic formulariesA study of the scribal practices in the Demotic magic manuals reveals both similarities with and differences from those described above for the hieratic formularies. The Demotic scribes continued working with the basic principles of the scribal conventions of old, but were not reluctant to experiment with the patterns and to introduce new meth-ods. These similarities and differences can be observed in the use of black and red ink, the selection of title words, the occurrence of para-graph markers and the structure of a recipe’s text format. The first three of these structuring devices are addressed one by one in this sec-tion; the next section is devoted to a close analysis of the text format of Demotic recipes.To an untrained eye, the use of black and red ink may appear to be very similar in the hieratic and Demotic manuals. As is the case with the hieratic manuscripts, black ink is used in the Demotic manuals for the main body of text, whereas red ink is reserved for highlighting titles, paragraph markers, and numbers and measures. A closer look, however, reveals that red ink was used more sparingly in the Demotic manuals: only single words and phrases are written in red ink, never an entire text unit such as the incantation or directions for use.As regards the technical jargon and title words, a distinction must be made on the one hand between title words of a general nature and those that are more specific and, on the other, between those known from the hieratic formularies and those that are unattested in those earlier manuals. Bearing these two distinctions in mind, the following observations can be made: First, the title words of a general nature are ph̠rt, r¡ and gy, the first two of which continue the jargon of the hier-atic formularies. Apparently, whereas ph̠rt and r¡ had been retained, zpw and šnt had fallen into disuse as headings in the Demotic formu-laries. This fact is quite remarkable, because the roots of these words were still in use in Demotic.30 Their absence may therefore be an argu-mentum e silentio that they were deliberately discarded as jargon for Demotic formularies. The heading gy occurs as a generic term with 30 For šnt in the meaning “curse,” see pPetese Tebt. A ‘6’/30 (written šnyt). Sp occurs in the compound nouns sp n sh̠ (lit. “feat of a scribe”) and sp n ḥyḳ (lit. “feat of magic”), which can both be translated as “magical rite or formula”; DG 425, pPetese Tebt. A 3/30, and Ritner, Mechanics, 68, fn. 311."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" scribal practices in egypt 99the meaning “method of doing something.”31 It defines the recipe as a series of actions or steps to be undertaken irrespective of the type or significance of the prescribed substance or incantation. As such, this heading is even less restrictive in meaning than ph̠rt and r¡. As is the case in the hieratic formularies, these title words may be preceded, or replaced altogether, by ky or kt (another) to indicate that the recipe is of a similar type as the one preceding.More precise in meaning and content are the title words for divina-tion rites. Whereas the hieratic formularies are primarily concerned with healing and protection, the Demotic manuals also include recipes with detailed instructions on how to perform bowl or lamp divination rituals, either with the help of a boy medium or by the practitioner alone, as a means to make a god appear and to consult with him in a face-to-face encounter about any matter at hand.32 The title words of such recipes are very specific, such as šn hn (vessel inquiry), šn n p¡ h̠bs (inquiry of the lamp), šn n p¡ R≠ (inquiry of the sun), šn wbe ô≠ḥ (inquiry opposite the moon), sš-mšt (casting for inspection?),33 and pḥ-nt̠r (god’s arrival ). These terms are as yet unattested in hieratic formularies. Another specialized term is kswr, the word for “ring” 31 The same term occurs as g¡y in the Demotic Vienna Medical Book and as g≠y in the Isis Divination Manual; for the latter, see Martin A. Stadler, Isis, das göttliche Kind und die Weltordnung (MPER NS 28; Vienna, 2004). The term actually has a range of meanings such as “character, shape, manner, method”; see WB 5.15, DG 571. The restricted meaning proposed here is supported by a phrase used in the Isis Divination Manual: p¡ g≠y šn p¡ ≠l nty ôw=w r-ôr=f, “the method of consulting the dice/child which is to be done” (1/1 and 8). This usage is already attested in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, a 17th-dynasty copy of a 12th-dynasty original.32 It is important to note here that although the art of divination is attested for as early as the Middle Kingdom, the Demotic spells differ from the earlier types of divi-nation in the sense that they claim to produce a face-to-face encounter with the deity, whereas the earlier types of divination are about interpreting signs, either occurring spontaneously, such as dreams and moon and sun eclipses, or produced artificially. For the latter type of divination, see the preliminary discussion of a fragmentary New Kingdom manuscript with directions for interpreting the shapes of oil slick in a bowl filled with water in Sara Demichelis, “La divination par l’huile à l’époque ramesside,” in: Yvan Koenig (ed.), La magie en Égypte: à la recherche d’une définition (Paris, 2002), 149–65. For a convenient overview of divinatory practices in ancient Egypt, see Alexandra von Lieven, “Divination in Ägypten,” AoF 26 (1999): 77–126; for prac-tices in Greco-Roman Egypt, see also David Frankfurter, “Voices, Books and Dreams: The Diversification of Divination Media in Late Antique Egypt,” in Sarah Iles John-ston and Peter T. Struck (eds.), Mantikê. Studies in Ancient Divination (RGRW 155; Leiden, 2005), 233–54.33 For this term and its tentative translation, see GMPT, 200, fn. 59 [R. K. Ritner]. Joachim Quack suggests reading sšm-št, “Frageanleitung”; TUAT Neue Folge Band 4, 339, fn. 47."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"100  jacco  dielemanand accordingly the title word for spells to consecrate a ring and to imbue it with magical powers. The phrase tô-swr (potion) occurs once as a heading to a love spell involving the preparation of magically charged wine.In comparison with hieratic formularies, Demotic recipes make far more use of paragraph markers as an additional structuring device. Paragraph markers, usually written in red ink, indicate transitions from one text unit to another—for example, from the wording of the incantation to the directions for use and vice versa. Their frequent usage was probably born of necessity, as recipes grew in length and complexity. Whereas the hieratic recipes are in general short and con-cise, the Demotic recipes tend to be longer and to describe in more detail the proceedings and their sequence. This lengthening requires more reading aids to produce a clear-cut and easy-to-use recipe. To introduce the wording of the incantation the standard d̠d mdwt (words to be said) is used, often written as a composite hieratic sign, or a phrase such as n¡ sh̠w nty ô.ôr=k ≠š=w (the writings which you should recite) or p¡ ≠š nty ô.ôr=k ≠š=f (the invocation that you are supposed to recite). If the invocation consists of a string of names and epithets, for example the ubiquitous voces magicae, the phrase twys n¡ rnw (here are the names) occurs frequently. The directions for use are often introduced by the idiom p¡y=f swḥ ôyh̠, which means “its gathering things, i.e. preparation” and remains unattested outside the Demotic magical manuals to date.34 In ky/gy recipes the directions for use are most frequently introduced by p¡y=f ky (its method).Text formats in the Demotic formulariesWhen discussing the text format or relative sequencing of text units in the recipes of the Demotic formularies, it is useful to make a dis-tinction between recipes that exhibit a compartmentalized structure and those that have an integrated format. I use ‘compartmentalization’ 34 Griffith and Thompson translate the idiom as “spirit-gathering” (#730 in their glossary), taking the ôyh̠ as a writing of the word “spirit” (#30 in their glossary). How-ever, the determinatives do not match, so that, given the context, it makes more sense to take ôyh̠ as a variant writing of ôh̠y “thing, object” (#125 in their glossary). The directions for use are not about collecting spirits, but about assembling the required ingredients and implements. See also GMPT, 199, fn. 50 [RKR]."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" scribal practices in egypt 101as a heuristic term in reference to the text formats discussed above. Compartmentalized recipes uphold a strict division in their layout between the text units of [incantation] and [directions for use]. The term ‘integration’ I reserve for recipes in which these text units are to a large extent intertwined and loosely sequenced. Integrated recipes tend to be longer and to prescribe rites that require more prepara-tions and actions than is the case for the compartmentalized recipe. In our current, small sample of Demotic formularies, the integrated type is restricted to recipes for separation and binding spells, divine consultation rites and ring spells—spells that have no equivalents in the hieratic formularies.Compartmentalized recipesIn the Demotic formularies, the principle of compartmentalization is retained in ph̠rt and r¡ recipes as well as in pḥ-nt̠r recipes and some gy recipes. Demotic ph̠rt recipes follow the standard sequence of [title], [ingredients], [directions for use] and, if included at all, [incantation]. The majority of Demotic r¡ recipes retain the conventions of the hier-atic r¡ recipe with a sequence of [title], [incantation] and [directions for use, including ingredients]. However, a number of Demotic r¡ reci-pes violate the conventions by reversing the sequence of text units to [title], [directions for use] and [incantation].

In the following paragraphs, these observations are addressed in more detail.Demotic ph̠rt recipesDemotic ph̠rt recipes agree with the ph̠rt recipes in hieratic formular-ies in the sense that the central and defining element of the recipe is a substance or implement of some sort, whose constitutive ingredients are given immediately following the recipe’s title. In the majority of cases the recipes are very straightforward and concerned with instruc-tions for preparing and administering potions, ointments, pills and bandages, as in the following recipe for preparing a potion to stimulate a woman sexually."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"102  jacco  dieleman[title] Prescription (ph̠rt) for causing that a woman loves a man[ingredients] fruit of acacia[directions for use] Grind with honey; anoint his phallus with it; you are to sleep with the woman.35As is the rule for ph̠rt recipes in the hieratic manuals, the target of this recipe’s procedure is the client’s body. However, in the Demotic magi-cal papyri, the link between ph̠rt and its area of application has been loosened to the effect that certain Demotic ph̠rt recipes prescribe apply-ing a substance or implement to an area other than the body. Instead, as for example in the next passage, the substance is to be applied to the flame of an oil lamp or, as in the second passage, the implement is to be deposited under the threshold of the desired woman’s house.[title] Prescription (ph̠rt) for enchanting (ph̠r) the vessel swiftly to the effect that the gods enter and tell you a truthful answer[directions for use] you should \\put/ the shell of an egg of a *crocodile*, or what is inside it, on the flame.

First, the second recipe shows that Demotic ph̠rt recipes can contain an incantation, which follows, as is the case in hieratic ph̠rt recipes, at the end. Furthermore, the first recipe’s structure violates the ph̠rt genre rules by incorporating the ingredient in the running text of the directions for use instead of listing it separately following the title, as would be required. The most likely reason for this breach in the genre conventions is a need for brevity and efficiency, because the recipe is part of a series of concise ph̠rt recipes prescribing the use of alternative ingredients for producing different effects in one and the same divi-nation ritual (PDM xiv.1–92 = pLondon-Leiden 1/1—3/35). It is thus not a self-contained recipe. Third, the verb ph̠r (to enchant) in the first recipe contains the key to understanding why the ph̠rt recipe’s range of use could have been extended in the Demotic manuals. In Demotic the root ph̠r had acquired the explicit meaning “to enchant,” whereas in earlier days it meant “to contain and protect through encirclement.”40 Accordingly, a ph̠rt could now also be understood as a prescription that allows for transferring desired properties between objects at a distance, in both place and time, on the basis of the laws of similarity and contiguity.38 In translating ḥme as “longing”, I follow Robert K.

The term itself, however, had fallen into disuse and been replaced by ≠š (recitation, invocation) in common speech.41 Its continued use as title word in the Demotic formularies is therefore an indication that the Demotic scribes deliberately chose to adopt the age-old conventions of the Egyptian scriptorium. A close reading of these r¡ recipes reveals occasional variation in the relative sequence of text units.In the majority of cases, Demotic r¡ recipes retain the classic text format, as is exemplified by the following two spells.[title] Incantation (r¡) for causing praise and love in Nubian42[incantation] sumuth43 kesuth hrbaba brasakhs lot44 anaph abakha.45[directions for use] Say this; you must put gum on your hand, kiss your shoulder twice, and go before the man of your choice.46[title] Another incantation (r¡) for sending a dream[incantation] Words to be said (d̠d̠ mdwt): Listen to my voice, O akh-spirit of a noble mummy of a man of the necropolis who assumes [all his] forms, come to me and perform for me such-and-such a task today, because I am invok-ing you in your47 name of [. . .] in Abydos, who rests in 41 It is for this reason that the paragraph markers refer to incantations with the terms ≠š and sh̠w instead of r¡.42 Johnson (GMPT, 289) translates the title as “spell of giving praise and love in Nubian,” which is misleading because the spell is actually about receiving praise and love from the man addressed; compare with PDM xiv.309–34 = pLondon-Leiden ro 11/1–26.43 Note that this vox magica is provided with the seated man determinative in addi-tion to the divine determinative. 44 Thompson (Bell, Nock, Thompson, “Magical Texts from a Bilingual Papyrus,” 241 and 244) and Johnson (GMPT, 289) transcribe this name as lat, but the scribe clearly wrote the composite sign group for the Greek short vowel /o/; compare with the table in Quack, “Griechische und andere Dämonen,” 433.45 The voces magicae anaph and abakha start with an oblique stroke.

Why, in this particular case, did the scribe violate the genre conventions within this otherwise coherent cluster? A study of the other Demotic formularies reveals that there is a pattern and that this instance was most likely neither a mistake nor an idiosyncrasy.The London-Leiden manuscript shows a similar combination of classical and innovative text formats in its r¡ recipes. Six healing spells, preserved as a cluster on columns 19 and 20 of the recto, display the standard r¡ recipe text format and, were it not for the embedded voces magicae, one would be tempted to view them as “old-fashioned” hier-atic healing recipes transcribed and translated into Demotic.55 The standard text format has also been retained in a lengthy spell to secure love and respect and a spell against the evil eye.56 However, in three unrelated r¡ recipes, the normal sequence has been subverted to [title], [directions for use, including ingredients] and [incantation]. In the first recipe the incantation is in Greek and therefore seems appended to, rather than integrated with, the recipe, even though the rite’s cohe-sion on the level of acts and words is otherwise without question.57 The second spell works on the power of writing enigmatic symbols and manipulating the written object; the incantation is given at the end and amounts to nothing more than a straightforward “Bring So-and-so, the daughter of So-and-so, to the bedroom58 in which So-and-so, the son of So-and-so is.”59 The recipe can therefore hardly be termed an 55 As for the voces magicae, note that their number is very low, that all but one are without glosses, and that except for iaho sabaho abiaho (PDM xiv.592 = pLondon-Leiden ro 19/39) they have a ring to them quite different from those in the Greek manuals. I therefore do not rule out the possibility that this cluster of healing spells is indeed a reworking of older hieratic versions with some ad-hoc voces magicae thrown into the mix to make the spells “up to date.”56 PDM xiv.309–34 = pLondon-Leiden ro 11/1–26 and PDM xiv.1097–1103 = pLondon-Leiden vo 20/1–7 (the r¡ heading was never filled in with red ink). For the latter spell, see Dieleman, Priests, Tongues, and Rites, 138–43.57 PDM xiv.675–94 [PGM XIVc 15–27] = pLondon-Leiden ro 23/1–20. For this spell, see Dieleman, Priests, Tongues, and Rites, 130–38.58 The Demotic phrase for this word is awkward. It literally says “the house/spot of the place of lying down.” Johnson’s translation “to the house, to the sleeping-place” is incorrect, because the scribe clearly wrote the genitival n, not the preposition r before p¡ m¡≠. I therefore take it to be a compound expression for “bedroom,” despite the fact that the common expression in Demotic is st mn or ≠wy mn (DG, 159). This may have resulted from translating from Greek; Dieleman, Priests, Tongues, and Rites, 99f. 59 PDM xiv.1070–77 = pLondon-Leiden vo 17/1–8."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" scribal practices in egypt 107incantation in the proper sense of that word.60 The third spell is actu-ally a recipe for consecrating a magical ring (kswr in Demotic) that has the ability to fetch a woman when placed on top of a lamp and enchanted with the words, which are only given at the end, “Bring So-and-so, the daughter of So-and-so, to this place in which I am, quickly, within these hours of today.”61 Given its content and text format one would expect the heading of this recipe to have been kswr (ring spell ) or ph̠rt (prescription).62To return to the cluster of dream-sending recipes in the Louvre manual, all eight r¡ spells are provided with paragraph markers in red ink to introduce the wording of the incantation and the directions for use. In the first four recipes the directions for use are introduced by d̠d mdwt (words to be said) and not, as would be expected, by p¡y=f swḥ iyh̠ (its preparation). In the following three recipes of this same sequence the directions for use are fittingly introduced by p¡y=f swḥ ôyh̠ (its preparation), but in the cluster’s final recipe d̠d mdwt (words to be said) is used again, as is the case in the remaining six unrelated recipes in the manuscript, except for PDM Suppl.149–62. The occur-rence of d̠d mdwt as a tag to introduce the directions for use, if taken literally, does not make any sense at all and begs to be explained.63 There seems to be no apparent reason to account for the deviation other than a recurring scribal mistake, a lapse of reason or general 60 This also holds true for the cluster of fetching and curse charms PDM xii.50–164, which are all r¡ recipes by title, but factually writing spells that prescribe uttering the straightforward commands and strategically depositing the written and charged object.61 PDM xiv.1090–96 = pLondon-Leiden vo 19/1–7.62 For a Demotic ring spell with the heading kswr, see PDM xii.6–20 = pLeiden I 384 vo II*/6–20; note that this recipe gives the directions for use before the incantation as in the present r¡ recipe.63 Cf. Ritner, Mechanics, 41 where he writes that “conjoined as d̠d mdw, ‘words to be said,’ the terms conclude most magical recitations, serving to introduce the direc-tions for the accompanying rite.” I have been unable to find any corroborative evi-dence for this statement and suspect that Ritner refers here to the idiomatic expression “words to be said over/to [an object or body part],” which phrase serves indeed as a common transition from the wording of the incantation to the directions for use in hieratic manuals; in fact, the phrase is part of the directions for use. A demotic example can be found in PDM xiv.1102 (= pLondon-Leiden vo 20/6), where the scribe forgot to fill in the d̠d mdwt with red ink. The present case is different, though, because the d̠d mdwt is truly a meta-textual paragraph marker and not embedded in the text of the directions for use. In her GMPT translations Johnson evades the problem by translating “formula,” which is a paraphrase rather than a translation."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"108  jacco  dielemanincomprehension on the part of the scribe. However, this may very well amount to jumping to inappropriate conclusions, for the recipes are otherwise well written and structured—as is the whole manuscript, for that matter. Moreover, the same phenomenon can be observed on pLondon-Leiden, which was clearly written by another scribe.64 An alternative explanation may be that the archaic d̠d mdwt (words to be said) had become a paragraph marker par excellence, irrespective of its literal meaning.Demotic pḥ-nt̠r recipesThe term pḥ-nt̠r (literally “god’s arrival”) refers to a type of oracular consultation.65 Recipes that carry this term as their title word exhibit a compartmentalized structure without following any fixed order in the relative sequence of [incantation] and [directions for use]. This obser-vation is important, because other oracular consultation recipes, such as šn hn (“vessel inquiry”) and šn n p¡ h̠bs (“inquiry of the lamp”), have an integrated text format (for which, see further below). A further dif-ference between pḥ-nt̠r recipes and šn hn and šn n p¡ h̠bs recipes is that the former are relatively plain and simple in their directions, pre-scribe relatively short incantations and have few if any voces magicae. In other words, in structure and content, pḥ-nt̠r recipes correspond better with the classical schema than with the innovative šn hn and šn 64 PDM xiv.304 = pLondon-Leiden ro 10/31 and PDM xiv.411 = pLondon-Leiden ro 14/17. Brashear is mistaken when he states that the Demotic manuals were all writ-ten by the same scribe; “The Greek Magical Papyri,” 3404.65 Due to a paucity of instructive sources, pḥ-nt̠r remains an elusive category. It is clear that it refers to a set of rituals to provoke contact with a deity with the aim of interrogating him; “to reach the god”—i.e., to consult him. The rite can be a public or private affair, be concerned with issues that are relevant to the community at large or those that only pertain to a sole individual and, depending on its purpose, can be considered an acceptable and lawful form of enquiry or acquire an illicit character; Jean Marie Kruchten, Le grand texte oraculaire de Djéhoutymose (Monographies Reine Élisabeth 5; Brussels, 1986), 328–31 and Ritner, Mechanics, 214–20. Though attested as a technical term since the late New Kingdom, instructions to perform a pḥ-nt̠r (or in its Greek translation σύστασις and αὐτοπτικός/αὔτοπτος) are only preserved in the Demotic and Greek magic manuals. Since these are instructions for small-scale consultation sessions of a private and secretive nature that always involve incubation with the aim of seeing the deity in a dream, which is fundamentally different from the proceedings in the Theban oracular tribunal of the Third Intermediate Period, it remains unclear to what extent the prescribed methods and underlying rationale are comparable to those of the New Kingdom. References to a pḥ-nt̠r rite in the Petese Stories are in too fragmentary contexts to be of help in elucidating this problem; pPe-tese Tebt. C21 2/x+6 and pPetese Tebt. D2 2/2."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" scribal practices in egypt 109n p¡ h̠bs recipes, even if all three types are conceptually related. This discrepancy can perhaps be explained by assuming that the pḥ-nt̠r is an older technique and recipe type than the šn hn and šn n p¡ h̠bs. The extant pḥ-nt̠r recipes may then very well be reworked versions of older materials, whereas the šn hn and šn n p¡ h̠bs recipes are more recent compositions. The following pḥ-nt̠r recipe serves as a general illustra-tion of the text format.66[title] A god’s arrival (pḥ-nt̠r) of Osiris[incantation] O Isis, O Nephthys, O noble spirit of Osiris Wennefer, come to me, because I am your beloved son Horus.

When you go to sleep, you put your hand under your head. Good, good. Four times.69gy recipesA number of recipes in the Demotic formularies are entitled gy. This term translates into “method (of doing something)” and, accordingly, a gy recipe can loosely be described as a script for a set of actions, including reciting incantations and preparing ritual implements and medicaments. Instead of prioritizing the words (r¡ recipe) or the objects (ph̠rt recipe), the gy recipe is defined by the procedure itself, irrespective of the rite’s purpose or substance. About a dozen gy recipes 66 Other examples are PDM Suppl.130–38 and 149–62; PDM lxi.63–78; PDM xiv.232–38, 295–308, 627–35, 695–700, and 1078–89. 67 Quack translates “Gistensaft,” i.e. broom juice; TUAT Neue Folge Band 4, 354.

If you want to find a thief, you should bring a small amount of flax; recite (≠š) the writing (sh̠) over it; say the name of each man one at a time; make a knot and draw it together.

I will draw together to me here today, O my sister samal[a], so that I will give the items of Geb, which he gave to Isis, when Seth assailed them in the papyrus swamp of Buto, as she took in her hand the small amount of flax and made it into a knot contracting these entrails, until he was revealed to Horus in the papyrus swamp. I will take this small amount of flax with my own hand; I will make it into a knot until So-and-so reveals the stolen good that he took away.—It is very good.71The variation in function and format among gy recipes can perhaps be explained as resulting from a shift in the usage of the term. The term also occurs in a fragmentary manuscript of the second century CE that gives directions for dyeing textiles (P. Vienna D 6321).72 The 70 Following Quack (TUAT Neue Folge Band 4, 358) I translate mt as “item” instead of “speech” as in other translations.

Several fragments"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" scribal practices in egypt 111manual is structured into sections relative to the stages of the proce-dure itself by way of sub-headings in red ink. These headings are titled “method,” such as in “the method (g¡y) of cooling down.” The term serves here as a paragraph marker for larger sub-sections which, when taken together, describe a complicated procedure in successive, easy steps. Seen in this light, it is quite possible that, in the Demotic magic formularies, the term gy is a paragraph marker become title word and the gy recipe is a sub-section become a recipe type. This would explain, first, why the term is not attested as a title word in the hieratic manu-scripts and, second, why the gy recipe does not have a standard text format of its own. As said above, the use of paragraph markers only became relevant when the recipes began to grow in length and com-plexity. It was thus only at a late stage that scribes were in need of this term; accordingly, they never developed a fixed text format for this category.Integrated recipesThe Demotic magic formularies contain a number of recipes whose text structure is not compartmentalized. Instead of retaining a strict dichotomy between the units of [incantation] and [directions for use], these recipes exhibit a partial blurring of these distinctions, resulting in a frequent alternation between directions for use and words to be said within one and the same recipe. I refer to recipes of this type as “integrated recipes.” They deserve close scrutiny, because they are not attested in the extant hieratic formularies. In their structure, they rep-resent a true innovation in scribal practices.Recipes that exhibit integration are different from compartmental-ized recipes in a number of important respects.73 First, the principle of are published as Text B in E. A. E. Reymond, From Ancient Egyptian Hermetic Writ-ings (MPER 11; Vienna, 1977). Other fragments can be consulted in Reymond, A Medical Book from Crocodilopolis, where they are misidentifed as a manual on skin diseases (book A).73 In his study of the lamp divination recipes, John Gee fails to observe the peculiar nature of their text format. This may be due to the fact that he follows Th. G. Allen’s superficial classification, applied by Allen to Book of the Dead spells, of preliminary comments (P), spoken invocation (S), and terminal comments (T) and thus comes to the wrong conclusion that the recipes follow a standard pattern; John Gee, “The Struc-ture of Lamp Divination,” in Kim Ryholt (ed.), Acts of the Seventh International Con-ference of Demotic Studies (CNI Publications 27; Copenhagen, 2002), 207–18, 207f."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"112  jacco  dielemancomposition is not the integrity of the classical text units [incantation] and [directions for use], but rather the coherence of the successive stages in the procedure. The new text format was probably necessitated by the increased length and complexity of the prescribed procedures, entailing now several discrete steps of preparing the place of execu-tion, gathering and setting up all required implements, executing the ritual, and bringing it to a close. Each individual step requires per-forming certain actions in combination with uttering certain phrases and incantations. With the development of such complex rites, scribes were faced with the challenge of how to describe the detailed, intricate and lengthy procedures as effectively as possible. They may have felt that maintaining a strict separation between the text units of [incanta-tion] and [directions for use] would violate the coherence of the pro-cedure and produce a cumbersome and impractical recipe.74 Instead of following the traditional genre rules of compartmentalization, they opted for a text structure that synchronizes the words and actions. As a result, these recipes can no longer be broken down into discrete and juxtaposed sections of [incantation] and [directions for use], as I do for the recipes above. The essence of their structure can only be cap-tured by subdividing them into successive sections of [preparation], [execution] and [closure].75With the integrated text format, recipes tend to be more linear in structure, instructing the reader what to do, to say and to expect at each stage of the procedure. They do not require the reader to flip back and forth in the recipe, because they take the reader by the hand as it were through the procedures, explaining them step by step, from the beginning to the end. Accordingly, the recipes acquire a narrative quality at the expense of strict and regular formal divisions. The fol-lowing recipe illustrates the linear structure very well; note how the directions for use and incantation are juxtaposed for the first half of the recipe, whereas they are intertwined in the second half.74 The classic text format was however retained in recipe PDM xiv.636–69 = pLondon-Leiden 21/10–43 despite the rite’s complexity.75 The preparation section is concerned with preliminary actions such as cleansing the area of execution and praying to the sun god for a blessing. The execution section details all the actions and words prescribed for the actual performance of the rite. The closure section explains how to end the session without causing any harm. Not all recipes contain a preparation and closure section."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" scribal practices in egypt 113[title] Here is a method (ky) of inquiry of the sun (šn n p¡ R≠) of which it is said that it is well tested.[execution] Its preparation: you should bring a boy who is pure, recite the written spirit formula to him, bring him before the sun, and make him stand up on a new brick at the moment that the sun is about to rise, so that he comes up entirely in the disk.76 You should wrap him in a new linen cloak,77 make him close his eyes, and stand upright behind him. You should recite down into his head and tap down onto his head with your sun-finger of your right hand, after having filled his eyes with the black eye paint that you prepared beforehand.78 [here follows an invocation of seven lines with two strings of voces magicae addressing the light and asking the chief deity for truthful answers to any questions being posed.] After it you should recite his compulsion for another seven times, while his eyes are closed. Words to be said: “(a string of voces magicae) come to the child, cause that comes to him the god in whose hand the com-mand is and that he tells me an answer to any mat-ter concerning which I am inquiring here today.” If the light hesitates to come inside, you should say: “(a string of voces magicae)” for seven times.

In such cases, the rite cannot be performed as one reads along, but only after the whole recipe has been read and the correct sequence of the consecutive steps has been reconstructed. In light of user-friendliness 76 Following Johnson, GMPT, 239.77 The word ḳb¡t refers to any large piece of fabric or mummy bandages, but consid-ering the use of šntot in the parallel passage in line 23 of the same column, I surmise that the scribe was thinking specifically about a large garment. 78 The same procedure is prescribed in PGM IV.88–93.79 PDM xiv.856–75 = pLondon-Leiden ro 29/1–20."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"114  jacco  dielemanand efficiency such a text format seems counterproductive. One there-fore wonders whether this was intentional or the unfortunate result of a complicated history of textual transmission, possibly involving at times casual and inattentive copyists who, at some stage, broke up the linear sequence, deliberately or inadvertently, and thus produced a loose arrangement or patchwork of sections. For example, the fol-lowing recipe falls apart into a [preparation] section instructing the ritualist to ask the sun god for a blessing at dawn and an [execution] section detailing how to perform the ritual. The latter section gives the essential information of where to execute the ritual and of the relative position of the participants and the lamp only at the end, whereas in the relative sequence of the procedures it comes at the beginning.[title] Another method ( gy) thereof also (i.e. an enquiry of the lamp).[preparation] You should rise at dawn from your bed at the begin-ning of the day on which you are to do it or any day, so that everything that you are to do will be correct through your agency.

You should let him open his eyes and say to him: “Do you see the light?” If he says to you, “I am seeing the light in the flame of the lamp,” you should cry out at that moment “heue” nine times. You should ask him about everything you wish after reciting the invocation you did previously before Pre at dawn.80 This refers to the incantation to the lamp given in the preceding spell PDM xiv.459–72 (=pLondon-Leiden ro 16/1–14) on the same column. Johnson (GMPT, 230, fn. 344) is mistaken in identifying lines 478–79 of the current spell as the referent. Those are in fact meant to empower the ritualist himself at dawn, not the boy, as is explicitly said about a similar spell: “so that everything that you are to do will happen,” PDM xiv.473 (= pLondon-Leiden ro 17/15)."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" scribal practices in egypt 115 You should do it in a place whose door opens to the east, position the face of the lamp turned <to the . . .>, and position the boy’s face turned <to the . . .>81 facing the lamp, while you are on his left.

They are, how-ever, not always consistently applied. Moreover, the thus demarcated sections tend to incorporate more than one stage of the procedure and to integrate prescribed utterances and directions for use. As a result, the transitions from one step to another are fluid and ill-defined at times. It remains open to question whether this was a deliberate choice or is rather a reflection of carelessness on the part of the copyists.It is beyond doubt that the integration type represents a departure from the classical compartmentalized text format. It would therefore be a worthwhile endeavor to trace its origins, both back in time and across genres. For example, several hieratic liturgical handbooks for temple rituals, dated to the Late Period (seventh–fourth century BCE), exhibit features that are reminiscent of, albeit far from identical with, the inte-grated type.83 As regards other Demotic manuscripts, it is to be hoped that the unpublished formularies for healing will soon become avail-able for study.84 It should also be taken into account that the integrated 81 The scribe never filled in the cardinal directions.82 PDM xiv.475–88 (= pLondon-Leiden ro 16/18–30).83 Liturgies that deserve close attention are the “Ritual of the Confirmation of Royal Power at New Year” [pBrooklyn 47.218.50; Jean-Claude Goyon, Confirmation du pou-voir royal au nouvel an (BdE 52; Cairo, 1972)], the Ritual of the Preservation of Life [pSalt 825 = pBm 10090+10051; Philippe Derchain, Le papyrus Salt 825, rituel pour la conservation de la vie en Égypte (Brussels, 1965), and François-René Herbin, “Les premières pages du Papyrus Salt 825,” BIFAO 88 (1988): 95–112], and the Ceremonies performed for Osiris in the month of Khoiak in the Amun temple at Karnak [pLouvre N 3176; Paul Barguet, Le Papyrus N. 3176 (S) du Musée du Louvre (BdE 37; Cairo, 1962)]. The manuscripts are dated between the seventh and fourth century BCE; see publications and Ursula Verhoeven, Untersuchungen zur späthieratischen Buchschrift (OLA 99; Leuven, 2001), 287 and 318.

There is abundant evidence in the Demotic formular-ies that the scribes and copyists made use of Greek formularies when producing the extant Demotic formularies—or their mother-copies.85 Perhaps the integrated type entered into the Demotic formularies by way of translating and reworking spells from the Greek formularies. This might partly explain why the prescribed incantations in Demotic integrated recipes tend to feature multiple strings of voces magicae on average, usually written out in alphabetic Demotic and provided with glosses in Old-Coptic. These issues ought to be addressed in more detail in future research.ConclusionThe foregoing study of scribal conventions in hieratic and Demotic formularies resulted in three important observations. One, the appli-cation of black and red ink and controlled vocabulary to structure and regulate the flow of information is similar in both corpora. Two, the Demotic formularies continue using the classical, compartmentalized r¡ and ph̠rt recipe types. Occasionally, the genre conventions are applied less strictly than in the hieratic formularies. Three, the Demotic for-mularies also make use of a wholly new recipe type that integrates the prescribed actions and words while describing the procedures of the rite in a linear sequence.The first two observations lead to the conclusion that the compilers, editors and copyists of the Demotic magic manuals were intimately familiar with the age-old conventions of manuscript production of Egyptian temple scriptoria. They were professional scribes working in an Egyptian temple scriptorium, where they had access to the neces-sary training and mother-copies. It is more difficult to appreciate the full meaning and relevance of the third observation due to a lack of comparable, contemporary sources in Demotic and hieratic. The inte-grated recipe definitely represents an innovation in the production of unpublished, see Karl-Theodor Zauzich, “Die Aufgaben der Demotistik—Freude und Last eines Faches,” Egitto e Vicino Oriente 17 (1994): 9–16.

I believe that the introduction of the integrated text format was first of all a very practical matter, as it was necessitated by the general increase in length and complexity of the rituals. In this light, it is important to realize that the shift to longer and more complex rituals was a deliberate choice. For example, reci-pes for oracular consultations are attested in both compartmentalized and integrated formats. The former type gives instructions for a short and straightforward procedure, whereas the latter are concerned with elaborate operations. In other words, if the editors had wanted, they could easily have adhered to the familiar type of simple rites described in compartmentalized recipes. As the editors did not do so, the inquiry should accordingly be reformulated in three distinct questions: Why did one feel the need for more complex rituals, when did these ritu-als become fashionable, and who invented them in the first place?

In 1947, Samson Eitrem devoted a seminal book to this topic, identifying the conver-gence in a pagan desire for personal contact with the divine.1 Forty-six years and a paradigm-shift later, Marie-Therese Fögen approached it in a very different way, put the blame squarely on the Christians and emphasized the struggle for access to the divine fought by emperors and bishops that led to the disqualification of divination as magic.2 There is no need to take up this entire and vast topic again; instead, I will take a closer look at two oracles, one well-known, the other one less so, and try to use them as windows into the much wider general topic.3 The first is an oracle from Clarus given to an unknown town in Western Anatolia and known to us through an inscription found 1 Samson Eitrem, Orakel und Mysterien am Ausgang der Antike, Albae Vigilae 5 (Zürich: Rhein-Verlag, 1947); he talks about “[das] wachsende Bedürfnis nach persön-lichem Kontakt mit der Gottheit” (p. 17). In the meantime, personal religion has been driven out from most of the study of Greek and Roman religion, perhaps unjustly so, although the one monograph—André-Jean Festugière’s Personal Religion Among the Greeks, Sather Classical Lectures 26 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1944)—certainly shows a Christianocentric understanding of what religion is.2 Marie-Therese Fögen, Die Enteignung der Wahrsager.

All texts are epigraphical, and they all belong to the second century CE; over the years, I have come to doubt my original assumption that they all dealt with the same event, the Great Plague triggered in 165 CE by the troops of Lucius Verus returning from Mesopotamia.6 A few years ago, Zsuzsanna Varhélyi discussed them and underscored that the rituals prescribed by the oracle to heal the disease show an intimate knowledge of the local cults of the individual cities. This is an important insight. It helps us to understand how an oracular sanctuary functioned in regional context: we have to imagine mechanisms of communication and information between the Clarian priests and the city and its ambassadors.The oracle to which I want to return in this paper was given to a town whose name is not preserved; unlike other Clarian texts, it was not inscribed (or not only—but we do not really know) in the town that sent the delegation, but in Ephesus. When I discussed this text after its first publication, I supposed Sardis as the most likely client and addressee, but proof is impossible to gain without new evidence; 4 First published by Dieter Knibbe, Berichte und Materialien des Österreichischen Archäologischen Instituts 1 (1991), 14f.

The oracle diagnoses a magical attack as the reason for the disease that plagues the city: an evil sorcerer, as Apollo put it, has hidden wax figurines as carriers of this attack. To counteract its effects, the god prescribes that the citizens should fetch a statue of Artemis from Ephesus, Artemis’s main city (hence the Ephesian inscription, as a token of gratitude and religious propaganda). The statue should be golden and carry two burning torches; the city should institute a nocturnal festival in which again torches are vital. The sculpted torches of Artemis and the real ones that her worshippers carry in the ritual will dissolve the instruments of sorcery by melting down the waxen figurines that the evil magos has set up (lines 7–9):(Artemis) λοίμοιο βροτοφθόρα φάρμακα λύσειλαμπάσι πυρσοφόροις νυχίᾳ φλογὶ μάγματα κηροῦτηΐξασα μάγου κακοτήϊα σύμβολα τέχνης.(Artemis) will dissolve the death-bringing sorcery of the disease, melt-ing with fire-carrying torches in nocturnal flame the forms of wax, the terrible tokens of the sorcerer’s craft.The ritual recalls the many rites in the Babylonian Maqlû in which a fire ritual is said to destroy magical figurines. In Maqlû, we always deal with accusations of sorcery; the rituals are intended to undo the effects of such an assumed attack. As in many similar cases the world over, there is no need, in the Babylonian context, to reconstruct an actual attack by a sorcerer: the accusation and the ritual it triggers helps to find a way out of a major crisis.7 I assume that the same is true for our text, and I also assume knowledge of the Mesopotamian technique as a background for the oracular answer. This latter assumption is not easy to prove. The main text of Maqlû, after all, comes from Assurba-nipal’s library and had been written almost a millennium before the Clarian oracle. But copies of the Maqlû are still attested in the fourth century BCE, and the tradition of Babylonian exorcists is well attested down into the Seleucid era.8 It might well have survived considerably 7 For a modern European example of this mechanism, see Jeanne Favret-Saada, Les mots, la mort, les sorts.

All the other oracles share a common structure: before they detail the countermeasures to be taken, they always give the etiology of the disease, either the anger of a divinity or the unmotivated attack of a Plague Demon. From this etiology, they then derive the specific ritual measures that cure the plague: either sacrifices to the angry divinity, or purificatory and apotropaic rituals to drive out the demon. The sorcery oracle, however, does not follow this pattern, but refers to the buried magical figurines in a rather cursory way, as if it were something that the addressees already know. In this case, then, it looks as if the city had not only asked for a cure of the disease, but had also provided a first etiology, attributing the disease to the attack of an unknown sorcerer and his uncanny rites. Again, this falls into a widely attested pattern. In the ancient world, it appears especially in cases of sudden death of infants or young adults; since ordinarily the evildoer remains unknown and unknowable, the texts add a curse to hand over to the gods the punishment of whoever was responsible for the crime.10Given the character of the answer, I see two ways of reconstructing the question. One way is to assume that the client city asked whether the plague resulted from a magical attack (and, presumably, asked for a cure, or implied the cure). A comparable text comes from the Zeus oracle of Dodona, where someone asks:ἐπήνεικε φάρμακον | ἐπὶ τὰν γενεὰν τὰν ἐμ|ὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τὰγ γυναῖκα [ἢ ἐ]|π ̓ ἐμὲ παρὰ Λύσωνος·Did he/she apply a pharmakon against my offspring, my wife or against me, from Lyson?11 9 A parallel is the survival of Ereshkigal’s name (and function) in Egyptian magic of the Imperial age; see PGM IV 337, 1417, 2484, 2749, 2913; VII 984; XIXa 7; LXX 5, 9.

The reason for the consultation must be childlessness of the couple: γενεά is both the actual and the potential off-spring, and the latter use has paral-lels in oracular texts.12 The client does not ask for a cure, only for a diagnosis: were they the victims of sorcery or not? I assume that the client intended to use the services of a professional exorcist, if the god confirmed his suspicion.The second way is to assume that the city not only asked for a cure but also for the name of the sorcerer. Revenge for such a deed, after all, is a natural reaction, and the curses against sorcerers and sorceresses in the grave-epigrams prove this: They are cursed because there is no other way to take revenge, since either the law would not help, or the culprit remained unknown. The city might even have offered a name, as someone did also in another lead tablet from Dodona:κατεφάρμαξε | Τιμὼι ̓Αριστο|βόλαν;Did Timo bewitch Aristobola?13In a way, asking for a name seems much more likely than just ask-ing for a cure: Why come up with the suspicion of a magical attack and then not ask Apollo to reveal the identity of the sorcerer, or even propose a name for the god to confirm? In our case, however, Apollo remained aloof and did not enter this game: Instead of handing over the decisive information that could easily have led to a witch-trial, he prescribed a very elaborate festival that concerned the entire city. Maybe the god even reckoned that the client city would not be happy with his answer: again somewhat unusually, the last line of the oracle contains a threat (l. 18):εἰ δέ τε μὴ τελέοιτε, πυρὸς τότε τείσετε ποινάς.If you do not perform the rite, you will pay the punishment of the fever/fire.Samson Eitrem Seminar at the Norwegian Institute at Athens 4–8 May 1997.

Instead, they chose to unite the citizens not by a trial against an outsider—as happened at about the same time to Apuleius in Afri-can Oea—but by instituting a major city festival, performed in honor of Artemis, the Great Goddess of Ephesus as well as of neighboring Sardis. A communal festival, not a witch hunt, was the reaction, and it appears surprisingly wise. In its rejection of connecting a known indi-vidual with an accusation of witchcraft, this attitude reminds me of the course the Roman senate took in the case of Germanicus, who died under suspicious circumstances more than a century earlier. Tacitus preserves the grisly details of a binding spell found in Germanicus’s living quarters (“human body parts, spells and consecrations with Germanicus’s name inscribed in lead tablets”), details that might go back to the memoirs of his daughter Agrippina. The senatorial court, however, who tried Cn. Piso and his wife for this death, did not even consider an accusation of witchcraft, despite the fact that the family even produced the witch, but concentrated on Piso’s political and mili-tary insubordination.14 Some epochs and cultures appear to be more resistant to the temptation of a witch hunt than others.Oracle Two: Good Ritual as MagicAll these oracles, the Clarian one as well as the much earlier texts from Dodona, construct sorcery as something negative, a ritual that was the cause of bad things such as pandemic disease or other afflictions. Magic is something that society rejected, and the craft of the sorcerer manifested itself in μάγου κακοτήΐα σύμβολα, “a sorcerer’s terrible tokens.”My second oracle contradicts this. Eusebius cites it from Porphyry’s De Philosophia in a context where the Christian bishop attacks the pagan philosopher on account of his ideas about fate. Eusebius begins 14 Tacitus, Annals 2.53–61, 69–74; 3.12–19; see Anne-Marie Tupet, “Les pratiques magiques à la mort de Germanicus,” Mélanges Pierre Wuillemier (Paris: Gallimard, 1980), 345–352. On the sorceress Martina who died on her arrival in Brindisi see Annals 3.7.

This refers to a long oracle given to the Athenians on the final cata-clysm of the world in fire that Eusebius had cited at length in the pre-vious chapter.I am not very interested in what Eusebius does with this text in his attack on pagan divination—except that his commentary guarantees that we deal with an oracle of Apollo; with Aude Busine, I would also think that we are dealing not with a free-floating text, but with an oracle issued from a major oracular shrine, although we cannot know whether it is Didyma, Clarus, or even Delphi. Eusebius got all his information from Porphyry: there is no reason, then, not to take liter-ally Porphyry’s attribution of the text to ὁ θεός, although not neces-sarily to the same oracular shrine as the preceding oracle (which I am tempted to attribute to Delphi, on the force of the address to Athens.)16 Nor am I interested here in Porphyry’s reasons for citing this text. It is obvious that these reasons are different from Eusebius’s and concern Porphyry’s struggle with the concept of μαγεία on the one hand, and 15 Euseb. PE 6,3 (English after E. H. Gifford, 1903) = Porph. F 339 Smith (I follow Smith’s version of the oracular text).16 The oracle is neither cited in H. W. Parke and D. E. W.

He used this oracle to prove that magical rites are god-given and thus should not be rejected. Recently, Aude Busine said what needed to be said on this issue;17 I am more interested in the original oracle of which Porphyry gives us a summary and, presum-ably, the final two hexameters. The question addressed to Apollo concerned divination itself, spe-cifically the experience of spirit-possession associated with Apolline and other divination, where the god was thought to descend to the person asking for him, such as the Pythia.18 The god explained that a person asking for such an epiphany was too involved with the mate-rial world, so that he was unable to open up to the divine and receive the divinity in himself. The direct citation clarifies that this inability was presented as a basic human condition, not as the problem of one specific individual, polluted for whatever reason. But there were rites that were able to heal this condition and to remove humans from their closeness to matter. Porphyry called these rites “expiatory or apotro-paeic sacrifices” (ἀποτροπαϊσμούς), Apollo μαγεῖαι, in a rare plural.Hans Lewy understood the text as a Chaldaean oracle;19 in their respective editions, neither des Places nor Majercik have followed him.20 Lewy based his attribution on the parallels with clearly attrib-uted Chaldaean texts; he found the command to free oneself from the bonds of nature in another oracle, the connection of the material world with demons in a third one. The positive connotation of μαγεία would, of course, fit a context in which magic is more nobly called theurgy.21 The problem, however, is Porphyry’s attribution of the text to Apollo: Lewy utterly disregards this. If we take Porphyry seriously, however, things get more exciting.17 Busine 2005, 212f., 268f.18 See Lisa Maurizio, “Anthropology and Spirit Possession.

Porphyry calls the rituals that should free humans from such an attack “apotropaeic”; if we can once again take this literally, we are not dealing with purification rites for the soul but with rites that are destined to fend off a superhuman agent, which agrees with the preserved text. This fits the cosmology of the Chaldaean Oracles, as Lewy has pointed out: it is the demons that pull the human soul towards nature (φύσις);22 nature is identified with destiny;23 ritual frees the soul from this bond.24 “They (the theurgists) drive out and root out any evil spirit; they purify from every evil and passion; they achieve participation with the pure in pure places,” says Jamblichus.25 Proclus calls the telestic rites μαγεῖαι, with the same rare plural.26Thus Lewy seems to be correct, compared with the more recent edi-tors. There are, however, two things that make me pause. One is the clear origin of our text: it is an oracle of Apollo, not of Hecate, as at least the clearly attributed Chaldaean Oracles are; this is the reason Busine rejected Lewy’s attribution. But this might be a too simplistic and uniform view of what the corpus of Chaldaean Oracles contained; it need not be only oracles of Hecate. The other, more important dif-ference is that we are not dealing with the middle-Platonic ascent of the soul from its place in matter toward the divine realm from where it originated; instead, we are dealing with the descent of “the god” into a human being. The two differences are intertwined. The descent of a god is a clear model of Apolline inspiration, as for example described in a rather graphic passage in Virgil’s Aeneid for the Cumaean Sibyl,27 or as presupposed (although rarely stated) for the Pythia in Delphi.28 More to the point, such a model is the only one possible for an insti-tutional oracle where the inspired (or possessed) medium does not show any sign that her soul is traveling upward to meet her god “up there,” as happens in theurgy or in divinatory rites in the Magical 22 See e.g. Majercik, Or.

De def. 9, 414 DE; its root is Platonic, Symp. 203A, see the commentary of Andrea Rescigno (ed.), Plutarco.

Thus it is possible that an individual who had not succeeded to connect with a divinatory deity asked Apollo for advice, and he received the advice couched in a ter-minology that was very close to that which we find in the Chaldaean Oracles.The use of μαγεῖα in the sense of “apotropaeic rites” invites a final comment; in the end, this will clarify better how institutional oracles and theurgy could come together. Μάγος, as we all know, always had two connotations in its Greek usage, due to the very history of the term: the religious specialist of the Persians, the maguš; and by exten-sion of the term the Greeks had learned from the Persian occupiers of Western Asia Minor, the despised and distrusted religious quack of the Greeks.31 The two uses, the ethnographical and the polemical, always 29 I am referring especially to PGM IV475–819, the so-called Mithras Liturgy; see Hans Dieter Betz, The “Mithras Liturgy”.

This list is attested rather late, in a Byzantine commentary on the hymns of Gregory of Nyssa by the eighth-century bishop Cosmas of Jeru-salem. Cosmas makes differentiations according to demonology and purpose:34διαφέρει δὲ μαγεία γοητείας· ἡ μὲν μαγεία ἐπίκλησίς ἐστι δαιμόνων ἀγαθοποιῶν πρὸς ἀγαθοῦ τινος σύστασιν, ὥσπερ τὰ τοῦ ̓Απολλωνίου τοῦ Τυανέως θεσπίσματα δι ̓ ἀγαθῶν γεγόνασι· γοητεία δὲ ἐστιν ἐπίκλησις δαιμόνων κακοποιῶν περὶ τοὺς τάφους εἱλουμένων ἐπὶ κακοῦ τινος σύστασιν (γοητεία δὲ ἤκουσεν ἀπὸ τῶν γόων καὶ τῶν θρήνων τῶν περὶ τοὺς τάφους γινομένων)· φαρμακεία δὲ ὅταν διά τινος σκευασίας θανατοφόρου πρὸς φίλτρον δοθῆι τινι διὰ στόματος.Magic is different from sorcery: magic is the invocation of beneficent demons to achieve some good thing (as the oracular sayings of Apol-lonius of Tyana served a good purpose); sorcery is the invocation of maleficent demons for some bad purpose. These demons dwell around graves, and the term γοητεία is derived from dirges and laments around the graves.He then adds a definition of a third term, φαρμακεία, “poisoning,” that does not refer to any supernatural action but to ingestion of a powerful and harmful substance.The definition of μαγεία is rather unorthodox coming from a bishop, and his reference to Apollonius of Tyana might explain its main thrust: Byzantines, after all, used talismans made by Apollonius to keep away 32 Ps.-Aristotle, Magika frg. 36 Rose, sometimes ascribed to the Peripatetic Antisthenes of Rhodes.33 Philostrat.

He refers to people who make differences between goetia, magia, and theurgia, in order to ennoble theurgy. Augustine contrasts biblical miracles and magic:37Fiebant autem simplici fide atque fiducia pietatis, non incantationibus et carminibus nefariae curiositatis arte compositis, quam uel magian uel detestabiliore nomine goetian uel honorabiliore theurgian uocant, qui quasi conantur ista discernere et inlicitis artibus deditos alios damna-biles, quos et maleficos uulgus appellat (hos enim ad goetian pertinere dicunt), alios autem laudabiles uideri uolunt, quibus theurgian deputant; cum sint utrique ritibus fallacibus daemonum obstricti sub nominibus angelorum.These [miracles] happened through straightforward belief and trust in piety, not through spells and chants made up by science based on impious curiosity. The people who try to make distinctions call it magic or in the more contemptible name, sorcery, or in a more reputable name, theurgy. They intend to make more contemptible those persons who are dedicated to the forbidden arts, telling us that they are occupied with sorcery (ordi-nary folks call them wizards), whereas others seem more commendable to whom they attribute theurgy. But both groups are involved in fallacious rites of demons that hide under the name of angels.Magia, for Augustine, is a generic term of which goetia and theurgia are speficic subcategories, one bad and one good. His overall target is not magic but theurgy and its proponent, Porphyry, “who prom-ises a sort of purification of the soul through theurgy.” Given the 35 W. L. Dulière, “Protection permanente contre des animaux nuisibles assu-rée par Apollonius de Tyana dans Byzance et Antioche. Evolution de son mythe,” Byzantinische Zeitschrift 63 (1970): 247–277.36 It is not surprising that a later writer implicitly rejected this widespread defini-tion; see Nikephoras Gregoras, Schol. in Synesii De insomniis (Patrologia Graeca 36, 1021B).37 Augustine, CD 10.9, compare 10."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" magic and divination 131importance of theurgy in this context and the fact that the definitions concern Greek and not Latin terms, and finally given the interest Por-phyry has in theurgy, it seems likely that Augustine derived the entire system of differentiations from him, although he attributes it to an anonymous group (“people who try to make distinctions”) that makes it clear that in Augustine’s time the distinctions were rather common. Porphyry in turn might have used older definitions that made a dis-tinction between bad γοητεία and good μαγεία, adding theurgy to it; Cosmas of Jerusalem then draws not on Porphyry, but on the same general background, as does the oracle used by Porphyry.This background is much older, as the Derveni Papyrus has recently demonstrated. The overall argument of this text (that in all likelihood was composed before the end of the fifth century BCE) is still being debated; but it might be safe to say that it is a theological treatise of some sort.38 At the beginning of the preserved text, its unknown author talks, among other things, about daimones and souls. The relationship between them is not well understood, due to the fragmentary nature of the papyrus roll: they are either the same, souls of the deceased, or play a comparable role. In the sixth preserved column, the author begins to discuss the function which the rites of the magoi play to keep away daimones that hinder the contact between humans and gods:39εὐ]χαὶ καὶ θυσίαι μ[ειλ]ίσσουσι τὰ[ς ψυχάς·] | ἐπ[ωιδὴ δ]ὲ μάγων δύναται δαίμονας ἐμ[ποδὼν] γι[νομένο]υς μεθιστάναι· δαίμονες ἐμπο[δὼν εἰσὶ] | ψ[υχαὶ τιμω]ροί. τὴν θυσίαν τούτου ἕνεκεμ π[οιοῦσ]ιν ||5 οἱ μά[γο]ι, ὡσπερεὶ ποινὴν ἀποδιδόντες.Prayers and sacrifices appease the souls, and the incantation of the magi is able to remove the daimones when they impede. Impeding daimones are avenging souls. This is why the magi perform the sacrifice, as if pay-ing a penalty.38 See Gábor Betegh, The Derveni Papyrus.

Humans want to enter into direct contact with a divinity, for divination in the oracle, initiation in Derveni, but they are hindered by daimones. Special rituals, performed by magi and therefore called μαγεῖαι, remove this hindrance and make the contact possible. One difference is that in the oracle the hindrance results from human attachment to matter, in good Platonic tradition, whereas the Derveni Papyrus shows no trace of Platonism or a comparable cosmology or anthropology. We do not know why the daimones in the Derveni text intervene as an obstacle, and the respec-tive sentence is heavily restored. Betegh’s restoration that I have printed above—the daimones are “avenging souls,” ψ[υχαὶ τιμω]ροί—assumes that they bear a grudge against humans; this is more likely due to indi-vidual behavior than to a common human nature. Another restora-tion, however, makes them into ψ[υχῶν ἐχθρ]ροί, which sounds more general but even more enigmatic.40 But in both cases the rituals can be described as apotropaeic, ἀποτροπαισμοί, placating and thus removing the daimones. Another difference is that the Derveni text leaves open the question (at least for us) who the μάγοι are: are we dealing with a Greek interpretation of a regular Persian sacrifice, or with a Greek rite? Given the semantics of μάγοι and the apparent seriousness of the text, some scholars have argued for the “ethnographic” meaning.41 But if this should be the case, the author nevertheless explains a Persian rite—sacrifice with prayer, that is bloodless libations and an incantation—not in Persian terms, but in the Greek cosmological categories of daimones moving between humans and gods;42 and although Herodotus describes what the magos does during a regular Persian sacrifice as “chanting” (ἐπαείδει), he also insists on the bloody character of these sacrifices; there is no place for water, milk and the “many-knobbed sacrificial cakes,” πολυόμφαλα πόπανα of the Derveni text.43 Thus it might be easier to follow Johnston’s and Betegh’s suggestion that μάγος is a 40 The restoration is Tsantsanoglou’s.41 See the discussion in Betegh, 78–80; to his short doxography, add Johnston 1999 who, unlike Burkert or Tsantsanoglou, like Betegh understood them as Greek religious specialists.42 The definition of certain demons as “helpers of the god” is found in col.

V had described himself as a religious specialist dealing with divination, against Tsantsanoglou and Burkert who follow the ethnographical reading. This then would move this text even closer to the much later oracle.But it also can help to explain the persistence of similar ideas through more than half a millennium of Greek religion, from the late fifth century BCE to the second or third century CE, and give more contours to the general tradition behind this persistence. Religious specialists share traditions and knowledge in a transmission that can span centuries and surfaces only occasionally, when it makes a chance appearance in a preserved text. The Greek Magical Papyri preserve the name Ereshkigal more than a millennium after its last attestation in Mesopotamia; the corpus of Orphic gold tablets contains a text from second-century CE Rome that has its only parallels in three texts from a fourth-century BCE tumulus in Southern Italian Thurii, about half a millennium earlier. In both cases, we have to assume not only a tradi-tion of ritual texts, but also a line of ritual specialists to preserve such lore.44 As in the first oracle with its knowledge of the Maqlû, here too the oracular shrine tapped into an otherwise hidden source of esoteric religious knowledge.ConclusionThe first of my two texts has used μάγος in a negative sense, in the sec-ond μαγεῖαι are positive ritual acts. Although the second text might be younger than my first, albeit by a century at most, we cannot under-stand this difference in terms of development: if anything, the Der-veni text shows that the positive meaning is as old as the negative one. What counts is function—to use the demons against a city in the first text is evil, to keep away the demons from a human being in the second is beneficial; but both are μαγεῖα. Divination in turn is not μαγεῖα, but it can talk about it; already in the Derveni text, divina-tion, sacrifices and prayers are different areas of expertise, even when handled by the same specialist. Only when divination is read in terms of demonology, as in mainstream Christian discourse, do divination and magic converge.44 On Ereshkigal above, note 9; the Orphic texts are Bernabé’s frgs. 488–490 ( Thurii, 4th cent. BCE) and 491 (Rome, 2nd cent. CE)."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"MAGIC AND MEDICINE IN THE ROMAN IMPERIAL PERIOD: TWO CASE STUDIESChristopher A. FaraoneIntroductionUntil fairly recently scholars were accustomed to think, from their post-Enlightenment perspective, that superstition and science, magic and medicine are historically transcendent and absolute categories. Although few would take such a stand nowadays, this assumption still, in my view, lurks behind some scholarly treatments of professional magicians, who are sometimes imagined as uneducated, lower-class foreigners, in stark contrast to the elite and educated doctors. There has been much discussion, for example, about how during the Roman Empire these groups competed in the marketplace of cures, but this competition is still sometimes seen as a clash of different worldviews and approaches; we often fail to see how the doctors and sorcerers were probably drawn from the same circles of literate elites and might borrow from one another or share new ideas in the conceptualization and treatment of human disease.This study treats two case studies, drawing heavily on a series of recently published magical texts. The first involves the diagnosis and treatment of the wandering womb and the second a complicated Greek amulet from the northern coast of the Black Sea that aims at healing various diseases of the head. In both cases, although the magi-cians include in their texts outlandish symbols and magical names or invoke non-Greek gods, it is clear that they share a number of impor-tant ideas, images and formats with the medical writers of the same period.CASE I: The Wandering WombThe strange idea that a woman’s womb could wander about her body causing grave illnesses first appears in the classical period. Plato, in a famous passage in the Timaeus, suggests that the womb, like a “liv-ing animal,” is driven by “desires” to move about a woman’s body,"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"136 christopher a. faraoneinterrupting her breathing and causing various kinds of illnesses.1 The Hippocratic doctors writing in roughly the same period seem to know a similar pathological condition, which they call “uterine suffocation” and which they assimilate to epilepsy, because the victim loses con-sciousness, grinds her teeth and has difficulty breathing.2 Their strange “odor-therapies,” moreover, presuppose a sentient womb that could move freely about the female body in reaction to stimuli.3 The advent of human dissection in Greek medicine about fifty years after Plato’s death, however, challenged this theory of the mobile womb, for it proved what Aristotle had already surmised correctly on the analogy of the anatomy of other mammals that he had dissected, namely that the womb was firmly anchored in place by ligaments.4 By the end of the imperial period, most doctors take up a modified medical view that although the womb was incapable of free movement, it could flex and push against parts of the abdomen and in this way still cause the disease known as “uterine suffocation.”A series of magical amulets addressed to the womb illustrates the popularity of the wandering womb among another group of healers in this same period. In the past, scholars have suggested that these amulets point to a tension or a struggle between popular superstition 1 Plato, Timaeus 91b–e: “Indeed, on account of this, the disobedience and self-rule characteristic of the genitals of men came into being—a sort of living animal (hoion zôion) that pays no heed to reason and tries to rule (i.e., the whole body) because of its stinging desires (oistrôdeis epithumias). So, too, in turn the wombs and the so-called uteruses in women—there being in them a living animal (zôion) desirous of childbear-ing (epithumêtikon paidopoiias), whenever it is fruitless for a long time beyond its due season, being distressed it carries on with difficulty and by wandering (planômenon) in every direction throughout the body, by fencing off the passages of breath, and by not allowing [the body] to catch its breath (anapnein), it throws it [the body] into the extremes of helplessness and provokes all other kinds of diseases.”2 The Hippocratic Diseases of Women 2.201 (trans. Hanson [1975], ad loc.): “If the uterus seems to sit under the diaphragm, the woman suddenly becomes speech-less . . . and she experiences suffocation; she grinds her teeth and, when called, does not respond. . . . When the womb strikes the liver or abdomen . . . the woman turns up the whites of her eyes and becomes chilled; some women are livid. She grinds her teeth and saliva flows out of her mouth. These women resemble those who suffer from Heracles’ disease (i.e., epilepsy). If the womb lingers near the liver or abdomen, the woman dies of suffocation.”3 The fumigation treatments that they recommend clearly imagine a sentient womb that can smell pleasant and foul odors and move itself accordingly; e.g. ibid.: “You should fumigate her under her nose, burning some wool and adding to the fire some asphalt, castoreum, sulfur and pitch. Rub her groin and the interior of her thighs with a very sweet-smelling unguent.”4 Aristotle GA 720a12–14; see Dean-Jones (1996) 76 for discussion."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" magic and medicine 137and scientific knowledge during the Roman Empire,5 but the evidence does not, in fact, bear this out—at least not in the case of the wander-ing womb. Indeed, careful study of these magical texts reveals that in the imperial period, at least, the professional magicians who inscribed and sold amulets for the wandering womb apparently held the same modified diagnosis as their medical counterparts, imagined the shape and orientation of the womb in the same way, and used similar lan-guage to describe the motion of the womb and the symptoms it pro-duces. These magicians, however, based their therapies on an entirely different theory, that the womb needed to be exorcized as a kind of indwelling demon.Let’s begin with the doctors of the imperial period. Our best infor-mation about medical attitudes toward the wandering womb comes from the two most famous medical writers of the period. Soranus of Ephesus studied medicine in Alexandria, Egypt, where the advent of Greek human dissection many centuries earlier had revolutionized medical understanding of female anatomy. Soranus rejected the idea of the wandering womb, but his view was a minority one in the second century CE:6But the majority of the ancients and nearly all of the followers of other sects (i.e., medical schools) employ ill-smelling odors (such as burnt hair, extinguished lamp wicks, charred deer’s horn, burnt wool, burnt flock, skins and rags, castoreum—with which they anoint the nose and ears—pitch, cedar resin, bitumen, squashed bed bugs and all substances that are supposed to have an oppressive smell ) as though the uterus flees from evil smells. As a result they have also fumigated with sweet- smelling substances from below and have approved of suppositories made with spikenard [and] storax, so that the uterus fleeing the former, but pursuing the latter, might transfer from the upper to the lower parts of the body.Soranus goes on to criticize other kinds of contemporary treatments (e.g. massages, blowing air into the vagina, and subjecting the patients to loud sounds), but at the very end of his harangue he returns one more time to the fumigation therapies: “We, however, censure all of these men . . . for the uterus does not issue forth like a wild animal 5 Aubert (1989) 421–22, for example, speaks generally about “uterine magic”, which in his view “originated in Near Eastern and Egyptian cultures” and was “scarcely affected by developments in Greek science.”6 Gynecology 3.29 as translated by Hanson (1998), 84, with my additions to the list of fumigated items that she elided."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"138 christopher a. faraone(thêrion) from its lair, delighted by fragrant odors and fleeing bad odors; rather it is drawn together because of the stricture caused by inflammation.”7Despite his rejection of the idea of a fully mobile womb, Soranus never abandons the diagnosis of uterine suffocation. Indeed, elsewhere in his corpus he puts forth a modified theory that although the mouth of the uterus was held in place by ligaments, it could nevertheless still shift about in a limited manner and cause the seizures and suf-focation noted by earlier writers. His understanding of the womb is nicely summarized by a 9th-century illustration of the uterus found in a Soranus manuscript (Figure 1), where it appears as an upside-down jug of sorts, an idea that appears already in Hippocratic texts at the level of metaphor.8 With his modified view, then, Soranus was able to maintain that the uterus was held in place by the ligaments discovered by human autopsy, but that it could nevertheless still shift about in a limited manner and cause the seizures and suffocation noted by earlier writers. Galen, another important Greek doctor in this period, provides a long commentary on the passage from Plato’s Timaeus,9 and con-cludes (like Soranus) that: “The womb certainly does not move from one place to another like a wandering animal, but it is pulled back by the tension (i.e. of the ligaments).”10 Thus during the Roman Empire it seems that most doctors continued using the Hippocratic fumigation techniques and other traditional regimes to control a mobile womb, and that even the best medical thinkers continued to diagnose a condi-tion called “uterine suffocation,” which had symptoms similar to those of epilepsy and was thought to be caused by the flexing or swelling of a womb that was firmly anchored in the abdomen by ligaments.There is growing evidence that the idea of the wandering or dis-lodged womb was also popular among healers outside the medi-cal schools—healers who believed that certain kinds of spasmodic 7 Gynecology 3.29, as translated by Temkin (1955) ad loc. Like Aretaeus, Soranus clearly connects Platonic theory and Hippocratic practice; see Hanson (1998) 83–84. 8 Hanson (1995), 286. 9 On the Affected Parts 6.5 (= Kühn 8.425–26): “These were Plato’s words. But some (i.e., the Hippocratics and their followers) added that whenever the wombs, while wandering through the body, encounter the diaphragm, they interfere with [the patient’s] breathing. Others deny that the uterus wanders like an animal, but [they say] that when it is dried up by the suppression of the menstrual flow, it moves up (anatrechein) toward the internal organs because it desires (pothousan) to be moist-ened.” This translation is heavily dependent on the one by King (1998) 223.10 On the Affected Parts 6.5 (= Kühn 8.430)."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" magic and medicine 139 illnesses such as epilepsy, strokes or violent fevers were caused by the attacks of gods, demons and other supernatural forces that could enter the human body.11 This new diagnosis generates a new therapy: ritual healers now claim to be able to force demons out of the body by using a special rite called exorcism. Lucian, a Greek author of Syrian birth, speaks of this kind of practitioner as a well-known type in the second century CE (The Lover of Lies 16):Everyone knows about the Syrian from Palestine, the expert in this tech-nique, how many he takes in hand, who fall down in the moonlight, rolling their eyes and foaming at the mouth. . . . He, nevertheless, stands them up and sends them away sound of mind, after having delivered them from their difficulties for a large fee. For whenever he stands near them as they lie on the ground and asks, “How came you into this body (eis to sôma)?,” the sick man himself is silent, but the demon answers, either in Greek or in the barbarian tongue whence he came, saying how and whence he came into the person.Many more anecdotes like these—most famously in the New Testament—confirm that during the Roman Empire peripatetic exor-cists claimed to use the secret names of powerful gods to force evil demons out of sick people.This idea of the indwelling demon has important ramifications for the history of the wandering womb, because these same exorcists also begin to treat the disease known to the doctors as “uterine suffocation.” The apparent extension of exorcism into the realm of gynecology is not as odd as it seems, especially when we recall that a woman experienc-ing uterine suffocation was thought to exhibit symptoms very much like epilepsy and other spasmodic diseases—that is, the types of con-ditions usually treated by exorcists. Our earliest evidence is inscribed in Greek on a small gold sheet found near Beirut (GMA no. 51): “I adjure (exhorkizo) you, womb of Ipsa, whom Ipsa bore, in order that you never abandon your place, in the name of the lord god, the liv-ing, the unconquerable: remain in your spot.” This sheet was found rolled up inside a cylindrical amulet case, and it was undoubtedly car-ried about by a woman to prevent her womb from moving. The text can be dated by the handwriting to the first century BCE or CE, and one oddity reveals that it was probably copied out of a handbook and thus preserves an even earlier tradition: the repetition of the word Ipsa 11 Kotansky (1995), 243–46."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"140 christopher a. faraone(Latin for “herself ”) suggests that the scribe neglected to insert the name of the female patient and her mother at the appropriate point in his model. Note, also, that the differences between this exorcist and the majority of medical schools (that is, those criticized by Soranus) is not so great: most of the doctors believed that they could force a displaced womb back into place, because the sentient womb could smell and thus be repelled by foul odors, while the sorcerers aimed at the same result by threatening a sentient womb, which could comprehend what the exorcist was saying.A series of hematite gemstones are also concerned with the move-ment or swelling of the womb (see Figure 2).12 On the reverse of all of them is the traditional image of a womb as an inverted jug that strongly resembles the medical drawing of the womb in Figure 1. It has even been suggested that the engraver depicts the Fallopian tubes or ligaments on the top.13 The reverse side has a series of magical names followed by a brief Greek command: “Stop, womb!” (BM no. 351: στάθητι μήτρα). The second gemstone has a longer command: “Con-tract womb, lest Typhon grab hold of you!” (SMA no. 140: στάλητι μήτρα μή σε Τυφῶν καταλάβῃ). Here the command to stop swell-ing is backed up with a threat that recurs in different ways in all the wandering-womb spells of the Roman imperial period: if the womb does not stop moving or swelling, some powerful god (in the second example Seth-Typhon) will punish it.14 Both types of incantations 12 For discussion see Delatte (1914), 76 and 80, Bonner (1950), 83–84 and Barb (1959), 370–71. All of these incantations occur on hematite gemstones, except for the two gems from Athens published by Delatte (1914) and described as “black jasper,” perhaps in error as hematite has many shades of color and densities; see Hanson (1995) 290–92. Hematite (literally: “bloodstone”) was believed to have the power to stop the flow of blood, and it is understandable, therefore, that it was frequently used for amulets concerned with menorrhea; see Barb (1952), 279–80 and Hanson (1995), 290–91.13 Delatte (1914), 6 and Bonner (1950), 85: “The vessel shown on these amulets is a conventional representation of the uterus, and the lines proceeding from its top represent the Fallopian tubes, the others the ligaments that hold the organ in place.”14 It is unclear who the divine ally is on the gemstones that do not mention Typhon. The magical names that accompany most of the commands show strong Jewish influ-ence, but this is true for a large proportion of magic texts from the Roman period. The iconography, on the other hand, often depicts an Egyptian god sitting or stand-ing on top of the inverted-jug womb, who seems to be holding the womb in place: Barry (1906), no. 3 (Seth on top; inscription: στάλητι μήτρα μή σε Τυφῶν καταλάβῃ); Delatte (1914), nos. 33 (Isis in center on top; inscription: στάλητι μήτρα) and 34 (Seth on top; inscription: στάλητι); SMA no. 140 (Chnoubis in center of triad on one side, scarab on other; inscription: στάλητι μήτρα μή σε Τυφῶν καταλάβῃ); Philipp (1986)"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" magic and medicine 141imply, moreover, that the womb is already on the move or swelling up and needs to be stopped, unlike the gold tablet from Beirut, for exam-ple, which orders the womb to never abandon its spot and to remain where it is. They would seem, in short, to be curative amulets, whereas the Beirut charm is a preventative one. The Beirut amulet, moreover, threatens the womb in a much more complicated way: it adjures the problematic womb “by the name of the living and unconquerable lord god,” an unmistakable reference to the god of the Jews, who is, as we saw earlier, frequently invoked in Roman-period exorcisms.15In 1997 another incantation against the womb came to light in Brit-ain, this one inscribed in Latin on a lead sheet, which was then rolled up like an amulet (4th century CE):16Womb, I say to you, stay in your place, [which X] gave to you. I adjure you by Iaô and by Sabaô and by Adônai so that you do not hold onto the side, but stay in your place, and not hurt Cleuomedes, daughter of A[. . . .The use of the Greek letter omega instead of the Latin “o” in the spell-ing of the three Jewish names Iaô, Sabaô and Adônai clearly suggests that this spell belongs to the same Greek tradition. We should also note that unlike the author of the gold tablet from Beirut, who can imagine the possibility that the womb might wander away from its normal place, this lead amulet seems to reflect the modified medical view of Soranus and others that the womb is anchored in the lower abdomen and can only move in a tightly restricted way: the command to stay in place and “not to hold onto the side” is quite similar to the modified medical explanation of uterine suffocation discussed earlier.Our fullest view of the exorcism of the womb appears in a short recipe from a Greek magical handbook discovered in upper Egypt and no. 184 (Chnoubis in center of triad; inscription: στάλητι μήτρα); BM no. 351 (no god on top, but Jahweh’s name (Iaô) is inscribed on the uterus itself; inscription: στάθητι μήτρα) and the fragmentary BM no. 379 (Seth on top on one side, Chnoubis on top on the other; inscription: σ]τάλη[τι μήτρα μή σε Τ]υφῶν καταλάβῃ). Seth thus appears on two of the three gemstones that address the command to Typhon, suggesting that there is an equation here: Seth = Typhon, a commonplace one in later antiquity.15 Jahweh’s popularity on amulets for the wandering womb is clearly connected to his role as a creator god, who in the beginning placed the womb in its “proper place” in a woman’s body and who is consequently invoked to make sure the womb returns to its appointed spot. See Betz (1997), 51 and 53, who gives a thorough and learned discussion of the “creation theology” that informs the PGM VII exorcism and the Aramaic one from the Cairo Genizah (both quoted and discussed below).16 Tomlin (1997) with the slight changes suggested by Faraone (2003)."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"142 christopher a. faraonedating to the third or fourth century of the common era (PGM VII 260–71):For the ascent (anadromê) of the womb:I adjure you, womb, [by the] one established over the abyss, before heaven, earth, sea, light or darkness came to be, who created the angels, foremost of whom is AMICHAMCHOU and CHOUCHAÔ CHERÔEI OUEIACHÔ ODOU PROSEIOGGÊES, and who sits over the Cheru-bim, who bears his own throne: return again to your seat and do not lean into the right part of the ribs nor the left part of the ribs, nor bite into the heart, like a dog, but stop and remain in your proper place without chewing as long as I adjure you by the one who in the beginning made heaven and earth and all that is therein.

Schäfer and Shaked (1994), ad loc. suggest that the Aramaic translator did not understand the rubric and mistook it for a divine or magical name.

With the possible exception of the earliest text from Beirut, they do not employ the older model of the classical period, in which the womb travels freely throughout the body; here the movements of the womb seem limited to the abdomen or the lower chest and are thus in harmony with the revised theory of Soranus and Galen that the womb was firmly anchored at its mouth by ligaments, but could nevertheless cause medical problems by flexing to one side or the other or by swelling up. It is, moreover, instructive to note that the rubric to the PGM recipe, “For the Ascent of the Womb (πρὸς μήτρας ἀναδρομήν),” is similar to the one that we find at the end of the title of Soranus’s chapter on treat-ments for the dislodged womb, “On the Flexion, Bending and Ascent of the Uterus (ἀναδρομῆς μήτρας).” Likewise, the image of the womb on the hematite gemstone that we saw in Figure 2 suggests a similar point 20 Faraone (2003), ad loc.21 Spier (1993), 25–62 and Faraone (2007)."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"144 christopher a. faraoneof contact: like the illustration in the Soranus manuscript (Figure 1), the womb appears as an inverted jug and on some of the gems the engraver may have even tried to show the ligaments that hold the womb in place. Contact between the two traditions is also suggested by the command on one of the gemstones telling the womb to contract itself, which likewise seems to share the revised medical view in the Imperial period that the womb could swell up and stifle a woman’s breathing, without leaving its place in her lower abdomen. The exorcists who created these amulets, in short, seem to be literate persons, who share with their medical rivals a number of key ideas and strategies.CASE II: Head Healing and the Agate Gemstone from AnapaWe see similar signs of medical influence in the text inscribed on the reverse side of an agate gemstone found in the environs of Anapa,22 a Russian city on the north coast of the Black Sea, about fifty miles east of the entrance to the Sea of Azov. Despite the unusual spherical shape of the stone, Neverov saw that the inscriptions could be divided sensibly into two coherent groups each twelve lines long, that for con-venience he labeled Obverse and Reverse.23OBVERSE: πρὸς φαρμάκων ἀποπομπάς φραμφερεινλελαμε δαμναμενεύς αμναμενεύς5 μναμενεύς ναμενεύς αμενεύς22 Inv. 835. The gem is 3.5 cm in diameter. See Neverov (1978), no. 50, plate clxxvi. He dates the text to 2nd–3rd century CE, the conventional date for all magical gem-stones found without an archeological context. The gem was discovered in 1950 near Anapa, presumably in or close to the nearby ruins of ancient Gorgippia, a city founded in the 6th century BCE as a Greek emporium, which grew to a prosperous city by the 3rd century BCE, and was then destroyed by the Goths in the 3rd century CE.23 Since I have not been able to examine the stone itself, I give Neverov’s text with a few modifications indicated in the apparatus criticus. One of these (πολύπου in line 22) can be verified by his photograph. The form πολύπου (and not πολύποδος) is listed in some lexica as a “poetic” form. For lines 16–24, I have inserted a vertical space to indicate the division between two columns of text. On the stone, however, these col-umns are differentiated only by a change in the direction of the writing.

In the archaic and classical periods Damnameneus seems to have been some kind of underworld demon or deity, who (as his name “Subduer” suggests) controlled or bound the dead in the underworld.27 This triangular formation is a fairly common device on magical amulets, generated by spelling a name or word fully and then repeating the process continually, but each time leaving off the first letter, until the name disappears entirely.28 When decipherable Greek words like Damnameneus appear in this disappearing format on amu-lets, they are almost always the names of hostile demons or diseases, who are forced to vanish as their name vanishes one letter at a time.2924 Jordan (2002), 61–68 discusses another Russian gem (this one round and flat) which also begins with instructions copied mistakenly from a handbook (“This is the logos”) and he cites another example in the Louvre: Bonner and Youtie (1953).25 See, e.g., GMA 36:15–16 and 52:12, with Kotansky’s comments ad loc.26 See Faraone (2010) for a detailed discussion of this and other options.27 In the Roman period he continues in this role, but adds (by virtue of his assimi-lation with the eastern sun-gods Re and Shamash) a new identity as a cosmic solar deity who “subdues” the entire cosmos. See Faraone (2010) for a much more detailed discussion.28 Here the name seems to be shrinking from both sides at once, but this is an illu-sion created by the scribe, who removes only the first letter from each line, but at the same time shifts the right triangle (that would normally result) to the right, so that it looks like an isosceles triangle. If the text in Neverov (1978) is correct, the reduction does not proceed as far as possible, because the word could be reduced one more time to a single sigma.29 It is a long-standing hypothesis that disappearing names are a form of simile magic, a deletio morbis that aims at reducing the disease by reducing its name. See the comments on Heim no. 97, Dornseiff (1925), 63–67, and Michel (1997), 149–51.

This part of the inscription seems to be some sort of key or code, that tells us which magical name or symbol we must use to cure a pain or problem in the corresponding body part. Thus, for example, if we have a patient with a sore throat, we run our finger down the left side until we reach “throat” and then we discover that mistakenly, thought that the “heart” [i.e. “heart-shaped name”] is intended to denote the disappearance of the fever, disease, etc. At best this is a secondary evolution. . . .”30 Naveh and Shaked (1993), 192 (text), 199 (English translation quoted here) with Plate 18 (= no. 18. 9. 6–13a).

Note also that the author of this text repeatedly pairs an orifice (ear, throat, mouth and nose) with one of its internal parts (eardrum, “grape-cluster,” “octopus” and teeth), and that two of these smaller internal parts have metaphorical names that refer solely to patho-logical conditions. The word “grape cluster” (staphylê) in no. 4 refers to the uvula, which when it is swollen from infection during a sore throat resembles a tiny purple grape-cluster at the back of the throat. Likewise, the word “octopus” (polypos) in no. 8 describes a malignant growth in the nostril.We sometimes get similar lists of body parts on curse tablets, which specify—often in great detail—the extent of the binding or paralysis intended for the victim.33 None of the extant examples, however, seem to follow the pattern found on this gemstone. Three come close, but their differences are as telling as the similarities. A first-century BCE Latin curse, for example, lists the “neck, mouth, cheek, teeth, lips, chin, eyes, forehead and eyebrows” (DT 135a) and another the “head, 31 See Faraone (2010) for the argument that this gemstone was not used as an amu-let at all, but rather it was a miniature handbook of some sort.32 See Faraone (2010).33 For a thorough survey, see Versnel (1998)."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" magic and medicine 149forehead, eyebrows, eyelids, pupils, nostrils, lips, ears, nose, tongue and teeth.” An earlier, second-century BCE Greek curse likewise has an eclectic list: “hair, face, forehead, eyebrows, eyes, eyelids, nostrils, mouth, teeth, ears, throat and shoulders.” None of these three exam-ples, however, offer a good parallel for the Russian amulet, and the prominence of the eyes or parts of the eyes on all three highlights the fact that our gemstone neglects the eyes entirely.There is, however, a list with fairly close parallels in the Hippocratic treatise De affectionibus, which offers an eclectic survey of the parts of the human body and suggestions about what to do if the patient feels pain in a particular part or if that part swells up.34 It functions, in short, just like the Russian gemstone, except that it offers brief medical expla-nations (based on Hippocratic humoral theory) and advice for treat-ment, instead of magical symbols or names. The treatise begins with a chapter on the head (2–5), which is divided into seven sections, each devoted to a different part of the head or face. Each section begins with a somewhat formulaic conditional sentence, for example: “If pains fall upon part X, it is beneficial to do Y.” The chapter is organized as follows (I give the protasis of the first sentence of each section in the chapter):35ἢν ἐς τὴν κεφαλὴν ὀδύναι ἐμπέσωσι . . .(If pains befall the head . . .)ἢν ἐς τὰ ὦτα ὀδύνη ἐμπέσῃ . . .(If pain befalls the ears . . .)ἢν ἐς τὰ παρὰ τὴν φάρυγγα φλεγμαίνῃ . . .(If the area along the throat swells up . . .)ἢν δὲ τὰ οὖλα ἢ τῶν ὑπὸ τὴν γλῶσσαν φλεγμαίνῃ . . .(If the gums or any of the places beneath the tongue swell up . . .)ἢν δὲ ἡ σταφυλὴ κατακρεμασθῇ καὶ πνίγῃ . . .(If the inflamed uvula hangs down and chokes [i.e. the patient] . . .)ὅσα δὲ περὶ ὀδόντας γίνεται ἀλήματα . . .(However many pains there are around the teeth . . .)ἢν δὲ ἐν τῇ ῥινὶ πώλυπος γένηται . . .(If a polyp forms in the nose . . .)34 Potter (1988), 4–5.35 Many thanks to Lesley Dean-Jones for bringing this text to my attention."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"150 christopher a. faraoneταῦτα μὲν ὅσα ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς φύεται νοσήματα, πλὴν ὀφθαλμῶν. ταῦτα δὲ χωρὶς γεγράφεται.(These are the diseases that arise from the head, except those of the eyes, which will be described separately.)The parallels between the Hippocratic list and the magical one are sig-nificant. Both, for example, generally focus on the parts of the head that may be subjected to a pathology, but both break this pattern by listing the same two terms for pathological growths in the throat and nose: the “grape-cluster” and the “octopus.”Both lists, moreover, seem interested in healing the same areas and start out, at least, in a similar order:Gemstone:1: brain2: ears and eardrum3: “grape-cluster” and throat4: forehead5: nostril and “octopus”6: teeth and mouthDe affectionibus 2–5:1: head2: ears3: throat4: gums and tongue5: “grape-cluster”6: teeth7: “octopus” in noseThe list on the gemstone, as we saw, makes one trip down the sides of the head, and then returns to the top again (forehead) for a second descent down the middle of the face ending with the mouth. The list in De affectionibus 2–5, on the other hand, makes an identical first trip down the sides of the head, but then reverses direction and goes up the middle of the face and stops at the nose. Both, moreover, ignore the eyes entirely, a lapse that makes sense once we read the final line of the chapter on the head in the De affectionibus, which explains that the diseases of the eyes will be described separately.3636 Galen, in his De compositione medicamentorum, sets aside all of chapter two for the eyes, because of the special care that must be taken in medicating the eyes, so that the treatment does not add pain through being too caustic.

Galen’s De compositione medicamentorum, a handbook on beneficial medicines for various parts of the body, begins at the top with a chapter on the diseases of the head, and then has individual chapters on headaches (Chapter 2), ears, tonsils and nose (3) and then eyes, eyebrows and eyelids (4). In each he briefly describes a series of pathologies, each followed by a recommended ointment or drug. Other medical writers use a similar format for the so-called “medical catechisms,” like the pseudo-Soranian Quaestiones medicinales, which begin with a ques-tion (“What is disease X?”) followed by a description of the symptoms and suggestions for treatments.38 Even shorter forms, like the pseudo-Galenic Definitiones medicae (19.346–462 Kühn), dispense with the questions altogether, and the sands of Egypt have turned up sixteen fragments of both types (and some hybrids), suggesting that they were very popular in the Imperial Period.39 All of these handbooks seem to have been organized in head-to-toe fashion and work, like the Anapa gemstone, as a kind of key, whereby the user looks up the affected body-part and then finds the necessary information, be it a definition of a pathology or the name of a useful drug or regime to combat it.ConclusionWhen scholars (myself included) discern such close parallels between magical texts and religious or medical ones, we sometimes assume that their relationship is a parasitic one, in which the culturally low magi-cian borrows and inevitably degenerates knowledge from a morally or educationally higher cultural realm. This kind of approach, however, vastly oversimplifies the contexts in which these texts circulated and were used. The man who inscribed the agate gemstone and the one who composed the Peri Pathôn are both clearly educated and literate 37 Potter (1988), 2.38 For text, see Rose (1870), 243–274.39 Hanson (2004)."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"152 christopher a. faraone individuals, who have produced complicated keys for treating diseases: for each part of the head and face they supply the appropriate treat-ment. Indeed, the De affectionibus, although originally written for doc-tors, seems to have been repackaged at some point as a self-help manual for a wider and more popular audience than was first intended.40 The main difference between the medical and magical texts, moreover, is that the Hippocratic doctor recommends dietetic regimes based on the theory of the humors, and the sorcerer provides secret magical names and symbols based on ideas of sympathetic magic or powerful names. Neither approach, I should point out, would be acceptable medical practice in this day and age, as each embraces complicated systematic theories based more on fantasy than on any real empirical research.There are also clear signs in both of the cases presented here that deeper folk beliefs may lie behind the shared magical and medical knowledge. We have seen, for example, that both traditions imagine the womb as an inverted jug that might “run up” from its normal posi-tion in the lower abdomen. Might it be the case that both ideas were borrowed from midwives or other traditional healers? Indeed, schol-ars generally believe that the Hippocratic fumigation techniques for manipulating the wandering womb were borrowed from such popular healers. And who is to say whether the use of evocative names like “grape-cluster” and “octopus” for diseased conditions does not begin with the same healers or—for that matter—the orderly cataloging of the parts of the head? We must remember that in pre-literate cultures catalogues are a crucial means of orally preserving and transmitting vital knowledge for the community.Traditional scholarly prejudices have, in fact, infected the very man-ner in which I have in this essay presented two clearly distinct groups: the magicians and the doctors. Such a clear dichotomy is achieved only by setting (as I have) Soranus and Galen on the one side, and authors of the magical papyri on the other. But, as we have seen, the medical views of Soranus and Galen are not typical of the views held by most doctors in the Roman Empire. Soranus tells us clearly that “almost all” of the other medical schools in his day continued to believe in 40 The book begins with the following exhortation: “It is necessary for any man, who is intelligent (συνετός) . . ., to know from personal knowledge how to help himself in sickness, to know and judge the things that are being said and administered to his own body by the doctors, and to know each of these things to a degree reasonable for a layman (ἐς ὅσον εἰκὸς ἰδιώτην).”"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" magic and medicine 153the wandering womb and continued to use Hippocratic fumigation-techniques to cure it. Moreover, the medical handbooks that map the human head in the same manner as the Russian gemstone seem to be part of a popular tradition of texts that simplify medical knowledge for personnel who do not have full medical training or for those who wish to treat themselves.Finally there seems to be no obstacle to supposing that the same individual could have used both elite medical and magical hand-books in his practice, depending on the expectations of the patient. Galen, for example, criticizes a doctor named Xenocrates, because his medical treatises were filled with incantations and Egyptian mum-bo-jumbo. And elsewhere we discover that Roman-period doctors were well acquainted with the use of amulets and even approved of them in some cases as a placebo—for instance, Soranus’s famous tolerance toward the use of amulets by women experiencing uterine hemorrhages.41 Soranus, of course, does not believe in their efficacy, but he was one of the most brilliant medical thinkers of his generation and we must try to imagine what other doctors might have been doing in various corners of the Roman empire—for example, in Beirut or in West Deeping, England, two far-flung places where wandering-womb amulets have been found. All this suggests that the scribe who created the Anapa gem and the exorcists who treated the wandering womb could very well have been educated and literate men, who were con-versant with both medical treatises and magical handbooks, and who may have themselves received, at one point or another, formal instruc-tion in both traditions.42 Indeed, we have a good example of just such a person living in Egypt in the Imperial period, a certain Thessalus, who has left us a brief biographical account of how he attended medical school in Alexandria for a few years, before he became disenchanted with his education and traveled up the Nile to learn the arcane heal-ing secrets of Egyptian magic.43 Regardless of how we understand his encounter with the Egyptian priests at the end of his tale or the knowl-edge he obtained by it, he presents us with a credible example of an 41 Gynecology 3.42.3. For discussion and other examples, see Hanson (1995), 289–90.42 Hanson (2004), 199, for instance, suggests that the “catechisms” were “able to introduce aspiring practitioners to a store of medical knowledge and professional ter-minology and [that] established doctors could also employ them as reference tools.”43 For recent treatments of the various Thessali, that also review past scholarship, see Flemming (2000), 144–47 and Moyer (2003), 219–38."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"154 christopher a. faraoneeducated man in the Roman Empire, who claims to have had formal training in academic medicine as well as in the equally elite magical spells of Roman Egypt.From a larger cultural perspective, then, the sorcerers and the major-ity of doctors practicing in Soranus’s day were literate elites armed with handbooks and curative regimes that share similar formats (for example: the map of the human head), similar diagnoses (for example: the anadrome of the womb) and similarly schematic visualizations of the internal organs (for example: the womb as an upside-down jug). The healing regimes for these two competing camps were indeed radi-cally different, but in the end it is not clear to me that the Hippocratic fumigations of the womb and the dietary prescriptions based on the theory of the humors were any more effective than the exorcism of the womb or the use of magical names and symbols to cure the diseases of the head. My goal here is not, of course, to denigrate the doctors of the Roman imperial period, but rather it is to rehabilitate the sorcerers as fellow elites, who likewise depended on technical handbooks and theorized the human body and its diseases in similar ways.44AbbreviationsGMA R.

Today, one can hardly write a comprehensive phenomenology of the subject, tak-ing into consideration every comparative aspect of the subject and its assessment. In other words, the more diversified our knowledge of the subject becomes, the more demanding its study turns. One solution to this problem is limiting the discussion to one aspect of the subject, with a particular emphasis on a certain topic. In the present study, I shall try to give an example of what I have in mind, assuming that the example at hand and the manner in which it is presented here have paradigmatic significance for a wide range of phenomenological and methodological issues.The vantage point that serves us here is that of ritual studies and ritual theory. My argument runs as follows: Every magical act is either preceded or followed (sometimes both are the case) by certain rituals. However, cursory readings of magical literature, a common habit among many scholars, do not make it evident that there might be a connection between the ritual preparations and the magical act itself. In my view, though, there is an interesting connection between the aims of the magical act, the core event, and the manner in which one prepares for doing it. This connection constitutes the ritual procedure and, hence, the theory of the ritual event. I have explored the subject in my book Rituals and Ritual Theory in Ancient Israel (Leiden and 1 This paper constitutes the enlarged and revised version of a lecture I have given in the framework of the conference, “Continuity and Innovation in the Magical Tra-dition,” on July 17, 2006. Since it is written in the form of a methodological essay, I considered it essential not to distract the attention of the reader from the major line of argumentation with details that usually belong to the footnotes. Thus, the number of footnotes will be as restricted as possible, only to those giving the essentials of background information."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"160  ithamar  gruenwaldBoston, 2003), and I shall try to show that the conclusions reached there are valid, too, in the cases of magic in general, and of the theur-gic rituals done to prepare and protect the mystic as described in the Hekhalot literature in particular.For reasons dictated by the limited space at my disposal, I shall have to examine one example out of the many available. I assume that the example chosen is strong enough to convince the reader that, in general, magical acts are shaped in the course of uniquely configured procedures that structurally function as rituals. This assumption is the quintessence of my understanding of what constitutes the ritual theory in each case. I shall try to show that, since they are crafted to work once, ad hoc and/or ad hominem, the magical acts at hand should be studied in their individual context.IMore specifically, this paper aims at bringing to the discussion table new agenda for the study of the relationship between essential aspects of magic and mysticism.2 It proposes to create a new map for the terri-tory, which points out ways leading to the two subjects at hand. I shall start, though, by reviewing a few scholarly approaches to the study of the relationship between Merkavah mysticism and magic. Then, I shall discuss the contribution that the discussion of ritual and ritual theory as presented in my book can offer to the discussion of the questions at hand. In modern scholarship, the relationship between Merkavah mysticism and magic touches on three methodological issues. The first one is represented by Gershom Scholem, in the chapter on “The Theurgic Elements of the Lesser Hekhalot and the Magical Papyri.”3 2 In his recently published study James R. Davila, Descenders to the Chariot: The People Behind the Hekhalot Literature (Brill, 2001), the author tries to discuss this issue, citing many parallel sources. However, his major aim is to create a triangle in which magic, mysticism, and shamanism meet. Although he is aware of the essential differences between Merkavah mysticism and Shamanism (as I argued many years ago), he still forces his point, but in my view does not satisfactorily create a shift of scholarly orientation. See his discussion on pp. 49–51. Furthermore, the many sources Davila quotes from the area of magic and the magical aspects of Merkavah mysticism are left without a proper analysis from the point of view of their ritual function.3 Chapter X in Gershom Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkavah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition, two editions (New York, 1960 and 1965), p. 75. All the references here are mainly to that page."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  161For Scholem, the magico-theurgic element in Merkavah mysticism is best explained in light of materials known from the Greek Magical Papyri. Scholem furthermore argues: “The theurgic element was not a later addition to the texts but a basic component, one which the editors of such books as the Greater Hekhalot, 3 Enoch, and the Masekheth Hekhalot attempted to minimize or discard entirely.” Scholem makes this statement in reaction to a previous one made by Adolf Jellinek, to the effect that the mysticism of the Hekhalot was only combined with theurgic elements at a later stage of development.Paradoxically, Scholem also subscribes to the view expressed by Karl Preisendanz, who argues that “As time progressed, the external para-phernalia of incantations, formulae, magic words, etc. in this literature [= The Greek Magical Papyri] gained continually in volume. What originally constituted a simple theurgic practice has finally grown into a highly pretentious and elaborate magical apparatus . . .” Scholem found it difficult to make up his mind and suggest a conclusive pic-ture. On the one hand, he said that in their various phases of develop-ment major texts of the Merkavah literature lost or minimized their theurgic elements. On the other, he followed Jellinek and Preisendanz, arguing that the theurgic materials gradually gained in volume and importance.I approach the subject from a different angle. In my discussion of the issue in Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden and Köln, 1980), I disconnect the Hekhalot writings from their ultimate prove-nance in the (rather late) Greek Magical Papyri. I offer a more detailed and nuanced analysis of the problems at hand. My principal argument, that entails an innovative side vis-à-vis Scholem, consists of the sug-gestion to view the magical and theurgic parts of the Hekhalot litera-ture not in light of the Greek Magical Papyri but in light of the wide spectra of Judaic life and existential needs, in which magic used to play various roles.4 My way leads from the Hebrew Scripture, through apocalypticism, to rabbinic literature. I must admit, though, that when I wrote the relevant chapter in my book (Chapter Four: “The Hekhalot Literature,” pp. 98–123), the Geniza materials were largely unknown. 4 See now, Jonathan Garb, Manifestations of Power in Jewish Mysticism [in Hebrew], (Jerusalem, 2005); Gideon Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic: A History (Cambridge, 2008), Yuval Harari, Early Jewish Magic: Research, Method, Sources [in Hebrew], (Jerusalem, 2010). All these studies were published after the major line of argumentation in this paper had been conceived and written."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"162  ithamar  gruenwaldBeing now aware of their existence,5 I am convinced that they could have supported my view and given it a larger spectrum and more exis-tential depth than was possible at the time.In any event, I believe that knowledge of those materials in their astonishing variety would have strengthened my “Judaic” position. One must admit, though, that the magico-theurgic elements in the Hek-halot literature show a large variety of usages, depending on author, place and time of composition. One could add at this point that the factor of inner traditions in their various forms of development can be traced with difficulty. In other words, taken together, all these factors do not always amount to clearly identifiable positions. With all the historical differences, thematic stratification and structural diversifica-tion, they all point to one direction: their solid, and indelible, presence in the Judaic world in Talmudic times.For reasons that I am at a loss to explain and account for, several of my readers preferred to ignore the complexities I tried to highlight in my study of the subject.6 Roughly expressed, these readers argued that my discussion of the subject was nothing but a repetition of the schematic, one-page assessment as presented by Scholem. The lesson I had to learn was a simple but frustrating one: It showed the paucity of attention scholars often give to the writings of their colleagues.5 In recent years Peter Schäfer and Shaul Shaked have published three volumes of Magische Texte aus der Kairoer Geniza (Tübingen, 1994, 1997, and 1999). The enor-mous efforts of the editors in publishing these materials deserve our praise. Those familiar with the subject report that more material awaits publication, as well as the magical materials written on clay bowls. A word, though, is due on the tasks that still need to be accomplished. The general practice of publishing these materials is embed-ded in their identification, decipherment, translation and short editorial comments. Work is now underway in characterizing the Jewish provenance of these materials in the various studies of Gideon Bohak and Yuval Harari. The methodological context of their studies is mostly comparative, and they have already rendered interesting results. The number of studies of Mesopotamian, Greek, Coptic, Mandaic magic is growing on a daily basis. However, the kind of work that this paper wishes to present—namely the study of magical rituals in the context of their ritual theory and in comparison to the magical materials of Merkavah mysticism—is still terra incognita to many scholars in the field. In this respect, its paradigmatic significance extends the limits posed by its title.6 In order to reduce the polemical tones of my paper I shall avoid listing all the studies I have in mind. For reasons that will become clear, the only exception to that restriction to which I will adhere will be Peter Schäfer’s paper reprinted in the refer-ence given in the next footnote. I believe that Schäfer’s paper cannot be bypassed in this connection."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  163The example to which I have already referred is Peter Schäfer’s paper, “The Aim and Purpose of Early Jewish Mysticism.”7 Schäfer suggested seeing in the entire Hekhalot literature a compendium of magical adjurations, thus discarding the seminal value of that litera-ture for gaining information about mystical experiences in late antiq-uity. Schäfer argued “. . . it is not the heavenly journey which is at the centre of this mysticism, with adjurations on the edge, but rather the reverse. Magical adjuration is a thread woven throughout the entire Hekhalot literature. This is true to such an extent that a heavenly journey may even culminate in an adjuration.”8 Similar utterances in Schäfer’s paper give expression to the same assessment. I shall add another quote from his paper, in order to convince the reader that I do not intend to misrepresent Schäfer’s view: “The world view which informs these texts is thus one which is deeply magical. The authors of the Hekhalot literature believed in the power of magic and attempted to integrate magic into Judaism. The central elements of Jewish life—worship and the study of the Torah—are determined, in the mystics’ understanding of the world, by the power of magic.”9 Most striking is the statement, “The authors of the Hekhalot literature believed in the power of magic and attempted to integrate magic into Judaism” (italics added). In other words, Schäfer wants us to believe that the magical components of the Hekhalot writings stretch beyond their pri-marily instrumental context, facilitating mystical ascents and divine revelations, and “attempt to integrate magic into Judaism,” no more no less.Schäfer’s dismissal of “Scholem and his successors,” with the foot-noted comment “This applies mainly to the book by I. Gruenwald,”10 gives an idea of what I have in mind when referring in the manner I have done to the work of some of my unnamed colleagues. In fact, Schäfer’s position looks to me as an arbitrary attempt to state the opposite of what commonsense and an objective reading of the texts in question show. 7 Peter Schäfer, Hekhalot-Studien (Tübingen, 1988), pp. 277–295. 8 Op. cit., pp. 284–5. 9 Op. cit., p. 290.10 Op. cit., p. 290."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"164  ithamar  gruenwaldOn the other side of the scholarly discussion, Jonathan Z. Smith marks a real shift in the study of magical practices.11 Smith examined at some length the scholarly output of category formations in the study of ritual and magic. For him, an initial reaction to the scholarly effort to place magic on the scale linking “religion,” on the one hand, and “science” on the other, was an adequate starting point. To me, however, this part of Smith’s essay belongs to the past. It belongs to what to me now resembles the apologetic zone of the study of magic. For more than a century, the scholarly study of magic had to find itself a locale in the triangle marked by the notions of “science,” “religion” and “rationality.” We are now free to discuss magic as magic and not as a by-product of other domains of religious and mental activity.Thus, I find greater interest in Smith’s systematic study of the choice of locations for the successful performance of magical acts. His remarks entail significant insights relevant to the discussion of ritual practice in its historical development. Although Smith, in his analysis of ritual theory relevant to the understanding of what is done and where, uses different categories than the ones I use, I find in his com-paratively brief comments much that is helpful in bringing about the needed change in the scholarly climate affecting the study of magic and related subjects.In fact, it leads us to the very heart of the matter—namely, the essen-tial connections that exist between the various stages of what is done, where, and for what kind of purpose. On a wider scale, it brings us close to the discussion of the symbiosis that exists between the magi-co-theurgic rituals of the Hekhalot writings and the parallel magical practices found in sorcery, healing, exorcism, adjurations, the writing of amulets and other kinds of magic. In contrast to many scholars whose interest in the theoretical side of magic is limited to its histori-cal, philological and comparative aspects, I think that the rituals done to prepare the magical act cannot be explored and properly under-stood unless their coherent connectedness to the respective efficacious acts is foregrounded. The same holds true for the magico- theurgic aspects of mysticism. I think that I am not exaggerating when I say that many scholars trying to assess magic still view it as a principally 11 See Jonathan Z. Smith, “Trading Places,” in Marvin Meyer and Paul Mirecki (eds.), Ancient Magic and Ritual Power (Leiden, 1995), pp. 13–27 (reprinted in Jona-than Z.

However, in the present context anthropologi-cal considerations will be given their interpretive chance. In short, we shall examine the extent to which the magico-theurgic practices, done in the mystical and magical domains, (a) are technically performed, and (b) show similar structural forms of integration with a variety of spell-materials.IITaking into consideration the two points mentioned above, highlights one major issue. It concerns the overall aims of the magico-theurgic rituals in both areas of activity—magic and mysticism. Most of the magical materials known to us consist of two parts. The first and major one constitutes the center of the magical act—the spell—and the new reality it wishes to create. The second consists of the ritual structure, including the utensils, objects and other means that are used in order to make the spells work and the desired reality accomplishable. From a literary point of view, adjurations are the noticeable form used in both of the cases mentioned here—magic and mysticism. However, one dif-ference must be kept in mind. Anyone studying the magical materials from the Cairo Geniza, the magic bowls, and other materials of similar nature will notice that most of the texts concern earthly matters. They seek to intervene with social relations and have decisive influence on the operation of material—animate and inanimate—objects. However, the Hekhalot writings show other concerns and objectives. They deal with heavenly ascensions, the vision of the “beauty” of God, participa-tion in the angelic liturgy, and the disclosure of special secrets. These secrets mostly relate to cosmological matters in the past and to his-torical events in the future. The revelation of these secrets requires the appearance of angelic beings on earth. The typical matters that constitute the magical acts are the enhancement of love or hate, help-ing people to overcome difficulties and all kinds of disorders, cursing others and causing them physical damage and even death. They are all located in realms that are not included in what Schäfer calls “the aims and purpose of early Jewish mysticism.” In other words, Schäfer’s paper misses a number of crucial points in nuancing the discussion of the materials he places in the limelight.Indeed, “magic” and “theurgy” are rather flexible terms. They are “soft” and easy to move from one location to the other. However,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"166  ithamar  gruenwaldscholarly caution should guide us in what we can and should do. When the applications of categories are either mixed up or allowed to fall into the traps of arbitrary parallels, one may conclude that the warning signals have not been watched carefully. When one stud-ies the Hekhalot writings, in order to compare the theurgic-magical materials contained in them with those found in magic proper, careful attention must be given to major points of difference. Otherwise, one is likely to reach the point at which no demonstration can show that the assigned homework has been carried out properly. There are no sacrificial rites in the Hekhalot writings, but there are such rites in the magical texts. Hence, no blood serves in the preparatory practices of the Hekhalot writings. Libations of either wine or water are also miss-ing from the Hekhalot rituals. The names of angelic beings and the abundant use of nomina barbara, words the decipherment of which is quite enigmatic, create a noticeable similarity between the Hekhalot writings and the magical materials. However, the lyrical character of the Hekhalot hymns and the coercive adjurations in magic show that the two kinds of literature are worlds apart. The hymns of Sefer Ha-Razim create a singular phenomenon. They show a striking affinity to the hymns of the Merkavah literature. However, the magical parts of Sefer Ha-Razim are quite different from the theurgic materials in the Hekhalot writings.Since I do not have all the space I need to give a complete scheme of all the tracks of the map that lead to every aspect of the topic at hand, I shall limit myself to essentials that are needed for an initial fact finding tour. As indicated above, the study I am offering in the fol-lowing pages contains a discussion of a number of features that have not yet been given the kind of attention they deserve—in particular, the ritual technique that facilitates achieving specific magical or mysti-cal ends. I shall direct the reader’s attention to the need for finding a venue for the discussion of the links that exist between what is done, how and where, in order to make the magical act work. At the same time, we shall keep an open eye on the mystical techniques in their theurgic affiliations. This does not mean that I direct either ameliora-tive or pejorative criteria in assessing the techniques used in Merkavah mysticism vis-à-vis those applied in magic and sorcery. However, the theurgic practices of the Hekhalot writings have different aims from the ones which magic claims to achieve."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  167In short, my discussion focuses on the rituals that prepare the magi-cian and the mystic for their respectively transformed habitus, in the framework of which the mind empowers the efficacy needed for what they, respectively, wish to accomplish. At this point, I would like to say that the vast literature currently published on magic and mysti-cism shows limited interest in these aspects of the subject. The schol-arly work still focuses on parallel materials that can be assessed in comparative settings. Historical and philological considerations play a major role in this enterprise. The essence of the ritual core and its respective theory is a rather slowly growing area of scholarly interest. The pages that follow wish to infuse the subject with more energy and intellectual interest.In other words, the venue I seek is the one that will be conducive to examining magical and mystical rituals and their respective rele-vant ritual theory. An in-depth exploration of the materials at hand is urgently needed. Thus, if anything new can be said on the cases studied, it will have to take into consideration entirely different factors from the ones which sustained previous studies of the subject matter.The new vantage point, as explored here, aims at providing a new scanning range. It consists mainly of anthropological or behavioral aspects of rituals. These aspects are vital for establishing the hard core of the context in which ritual theory creates the links between the preparations and the act that follows. Viewed in its anthropological setting, the subject of rituals and ritual theory can function as the ter-tium comparationis in the study of Merkavah mysticism and magic. My study of rituals convinced me that in order to understand rituals qua rituals, every ritual act should be viewed as embodying its unique ritual stance.12 In other words, every ritual is embedded in its own ritual theory. Ritual theory is closely related to the structural manner in which the ritual at hand creates the efficacy of its act.In this sense, ritual theory is not a factor that rests on forensic pre-suppositions, most conspicuously symbolism and theology. Rather, theology, and even more emphatically symbolism, should be eliminated from the performative assessment of the study of rituals. Contrary to what used to be the common practice in the anthropological study of rituals, I consider it essential to minimize the role that symbolism used 12 See Ithamar Gruenwald, Rituals and Ritual Theory in Ancient Israel (Leiden and Boston, 2003)."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"168  ithamar  gruenwaldto play in their scholarly explanation. Mentioning symbolism, I refer specifically to the work of Victor Turner who, in my view, highlighted symbolism in order to minimize the role of theology. However, studies on ritual and theology still fill the shelves with their grandiose titles and sub-titles. In my view, modern anthropological studies have suc-ceeded in radically changing this situation, and symbolism begins to lose its interpretive impetus.I think that modern anthropology has also extracted magic and theurgy from the realms of fraud and deception. Twenty years ago, one could still find a statement like this one introducing a major com-pilation of magical texts:. . . people are not interested in whether or not magicians’ promises come true. People want to believe, so they simply ignore their suspicions that magic may well be deception and fraud. The enormous role deception plays in human life and society is well known to us. In many crucial areas and in many critical situations of life, deception is the only method that really works. . . . Of course, it is all deception. . . . Those whose lives depend on deception and delusion and those who provide them have formed a truly indissoluble symbiosis.13Similar words can be found in what people write on myth and mysti-cism. I find it a futile position to take if one finds consolation in wag-ing an intellectual war against such views. Let me say it as succinctly as possible: We have matured to live with the notion that one person’s deception is the realistic position of the other. The history of almost every branch of scientific knowledge is full of such cases. In my view, approaching a phenomenological issue with a disputation over the validation of its truth is a waste of time. I would therefore prefer, with the delicate veil that overhangs them, the concluding words of Clifford Geertz about the sense of what a present fact is:. . . the post-positivist critique of empirical realism, the move away from simple correspondence theories of truth and knowledge which makes of the very term “fact” a delicate matter. There is not much assurance or sense of closure, not even much of a sense of knowing what it is one precisely is after, in so indefinite a quest, amid such various people, over such a diversity of times.1413 Hans Dieter Betz (ed.), The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation (Chicago & London, 1986), p. xlviii.

What do we know of that past and of the people who lived it? Using a qualifier in Geertz’s text, I would say that the question is a “delicate” one. Trying to reach a conclusive answer, one can say, once again with Geertz, that it is “so indefinite a quest.” Since magic and mysticism are still practiced in modern life, the stigma of “past”-ness can be removed from them, with all that such a removal entails for their empirical assessment.IIIParadoxically speaking, rituals relate in a behavioral manner to the dynamics of the constant, including its regular patterns of change, which characterize any kind of normal reality. The changes from day to night, the transition from one season to the other, the collapse of the holy into the profane, the deterioration of health to illness, wak-ing up in the morning and going to bed in the evening—all play their respective role as endemic changes in the ongoing processes that mark the existential dynamic of constant reality. Every ritual relates to the aspects of the expected and the unexpected changes in either a nor-mally stable or disturbed reality. In many respects, rituals contribute to the solidification of the expected and the prevention of the unex-pected. However, if reality is exposed to unexpected and unpredictable changes, rituals are there, suggesting themselves as effective means of reversing the process and restoring the normal order. In other words, when abrupt changes have interfered or even taken over, rituals are there to help in their own special way, to restore the disturbed and damaged reality to its pristine conditions.Furthermore, rituals have their inner logic—that is to say, rituals are structured in such a way that their efficacy comes into effect only in performatively following the strict order that purports to be functional in shaping them into a working Gestalt. Only the strict performance of the various segments of which every ritual is composed guaran-tees success. Order and correct timing are essential in this respect. In speaking of rituals, scholars often refer to the factor of transformation. In light of what is likely to happen to an existing order, even minor changes make a difference. Consequently, the element of transforma-tion epitomizes the aims of the ritual process. This is true when the rituals are done in order to preserve an existing order or restore its orderly existence."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"170  ithamar  gruenwaldMagic entails highly-powered means of transformation. In the magical acts, unusual changes of processes connected with routine life occupy a special role. The same is true of rituals done in the frame-work of mysticism. In both cases, alternate states of consciousness occupy the center of the experiential scene. The human mind seeks modes of empowering its ability to control the physical, corporeal, and spiritual domains. These modes do not belong to the common forms of religious activity and experience. Their activation requires special rituals. Metaphorically expressed, magic and mysticism break the gravitational power that normally prevents matter from losing its bonds with the laws that govern the physical world. Conceptually speaking, the usual alliance, which religious forms of behavior try to maintain with the supernatural, remains on the level of belief. Religion aims to activate spiritual realms in which belief entails exercising spe-cial powers to achieve unique results. Miracles, and other components which need no specification, are part of this realm of belief. However, miracles are the domain of the charismatic performer. Unlike miracles, which pertain to be divine interventions showing the unique qualities of divinely inspired persons, magical acts belong in the sphere of the professional performers who maintain coercive contacts with angelic and demonic beings.Briefly, then, magical and theurgic rituals create or aim at creating extraordinary transformative events. To be able to bring about these events the people engaging in the respective rituals strive to reach unique states of mind. Two spheres of transformation characterize the cases discussed here: one works on the doer and the other brings about the change intended by the magical or theurgic act. Both the magician and the mystic have to undergo changes that enable them to do things that other people cannot do. While mysticism works in one, positively constructive, direction, magic can also bring about fatal breaches in regular life events. Death, physical incapacitation, illness and infusion of hate are only a few examples of what magic can do, when it is geared to do its negative, “black” job.In this connection, one may mention the various acts of breaking vessels in the course of magical practices. The breaking of vessels is not just a symbolic act. It is an act in its own right. It works on the pro-active, or pre-active, level. In fact, the magical procedure consists of two kinds of actions, linked together by what I would here refer to as their embedded “ritual theory.” The connections between each pro-active act and the core of the magical act are not always visible."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  171We shall examine at least one case that shows how this connection makes sense. However, it is in the nature of the magical act, and for that matter of the mystical act, too, that two kinds of acts are carried out on parallel levels. One of them is the pro-active, or pre-active, practice and the other one is the magic, or the mystically oriented, act itself. In fact, the pro-active acts—that is, the rituals involved—are vital parts of the mechanism that make magic work. They set into motion the desired process. In a sense, they are the pre-programmed activity closely related to the magical and the mystical event. To repeat: the manner in which they do what they do in order to accomplish their designated ends is part of the professional knowledge of the magician and the mystic. Evidently, they both share the belief that it is part of the secret inventory of their art.Thus, we find that many magical acts entail the slaughtering of ani-mals. One may think that these are offerings given to the supernatural agents—angels and demons—who are called upon to assist the prac-titioner to do the magical act. However, I believe that from a more professional viewpoint the sacrificial act has a more profound aspect. As we shall see in the example cited below, the blood of the sacrifice is considered as a power-enhancing ingredient in the magical ritual, while the parts of the sacrificial animal (not necessarily one that is offered in the temple service) may serve other purposes, as the case may demand. Slaughtering an animal is certainly a pre-active act that initi-ates a dramatic event, which intends to have dramatic consequences, either positive or negative. The place and the time of these particular acts are deliberate choices, closely related to the desired effects.Thus, when magic, and for that matter mystical theurgy, become objects of scholarly discussion, the specific terms of reference that should come into play are those of ritual and ritual theory. Although the words “ritual” and “rite” are frequently used in the study of magic and theurgy, they seldom refer to the manner in which any specific magical or theurgic ritual is constructed, and to the implications that this structure has upon the performed act. Hence, I believe that the subject of “ritual theory” and its implications have to be foregrounded in the study of magical ritual, and consequently allowed to have its bearing upon the study of mystical practices of the same nature."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"172  ithamar  gruenwaldIVI shall now refer to one complex instance from Sefer Ha-Razim, the Hebrew Book of Mysteries. It is magic, par excellence. The choice falls on Sefer Ha-Razim because it constitutes an interesting amalgama-tion of Merkavah-like hymns with magical practices. We shall keep the Hekhalot literature and Kabbalah in mind, too. Paradigmatically speaking, the example at hand will give the reader a chance to real-ize for himself the similarities and the differences that are involved in comparing both kinds of literature. It should be noted, though, that there are good reasons to think that the charm that we shall discuss has two parts. The second one will be discussed in due course.I. If you wish to speak with the moon or with the stars about any mat-ter, take a white cock and fine flour, then slaughter the cock (so that its blood is caught) in living water. Knead the flour with the water and blood and make three cakes and place them in the sun, and write on them with the blood the name(s) of (the angels of ) the fifth encampment and the name of its overseer (in Hebrew, shoter) and put the three of them on a table of myrtle wood.Stand facing the moon or facing the stars, and say, ‘I adjure you to bring the constellation of N and his star near to the star and constellation of N, so that his love will be tied with the heart of N son of N.’Say also this, ‘Place fire from your fire in the heart of this N or that N so she will abandon the house of her father and mother, because of love for this N son of N.’Then take two of the cakes and place them with the cock in a new spin-dle-shaped flask; then seal its mouth with wax and hide the flask in a place not exposed to the sun.Let us turn to a close analysis of the various components that consti-tute the essence of this charm.It combines a number of extraordinary matters. The presupposition that guides my analysis is that they are all interconnected. That is to say, the preliminary rituals, and at times those that follow, are closely related to the spell itself. The technique and the essence of the act are two sides of the same coin. I would not have opened the discussion had I thought that the kind of interconnectedness that I have in mind belongs to a rare species of charms. I believe that if the right effort is invested in the study of the materials at hand, and more research imagination is applied, this kind of interconnectedness may be discov-ered in more charms than is usually the case. I must admit, though,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  173that many magical acts look like accidental piles of disconnected ele-ments. Thus, I find myself joining the point made by the English poet, Samuel Butler Coleridge, who urges us to succumb to. . . the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adher-ence to the truth of nature, and the power of giving the interest of nov-elty by the modifying colors of imagination.The reader is furthermore asked. . . to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitute poetic faith.15Although the poetic discourse moves in different spheres from those of the scholarly one, I believe that Coleridge’s words have an evocative power that transcends their immediate context. No fruitful scholarly discourse that moves towards novelty can survive the separation from the “colors of imagination” and consequently the treasured moments of “willing suspension of disbelief.” In my view, the study of magic and mysticism moves in these alleys. The first impression one gets from reading the passage quoted above is that of a total collapse of empirical sanity. This impression increases, when reading the second part of the same charm (see below in section V; the passage is marked “II”).The first part of the charm contains a prescription specifying what one has to do if one wishes “to speak with the moon or with the stars about any matter.” Such a conversation is rather unique, particularly in light of what is at stake, namely, the love between two people. To begin with, the charm aims at establishing a verbal exchange with non-animate objects. In other words, it moves in a fetishist setting. This is one of the unique features of magic, and is amply recorded in a variety of texts. However, the linguistic factor is only a formal part of the matter. It has endless parallels in the psycho-linguistic behavior of children and adults alike. In a sense, this is also the characteristic stance in prayers, particularly to idols. In the rational life experiences of adults, this is often viewed as an oddity, but as long as it happens in the privacy of the locutor it does not draw psychological attention. In our case, but not only here, it marks a major characteristic of the magical praxis.15 Biographia Literaria, Chapter XIV (italics added)."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"174  ithamar  gruenwaldThe magical situation described above evolves in unique cogni-tive stances or mental dispositions. A cognitive stance is based on the assumption that it makes communication possible. In the terms used by Ludwig Wittgenstein, “Language is whatever one can use to communicate.”16 However, Wittgenstein significantly adds,What constitutes communication? To complete the explanation we should have to describe what happens when one communicates; and in the process, certain causal connections and empirical regularities would come out. But these are just the things that wouldn’t interest me . . .Neither do they interest me, unless, of course, they give way to the expansion of our understanding of the communicative features of magic. If we want to understand the various kinds of communica-tion that magic, and for that matter also mysticism, facilitate and aim at establishing, empirical modes of communication give only a vague idea of the unique diversity of roads that may be taken in this respect. In other words, communication with the moon and the stars requires what Wittgenstein calls a unique “keyboard”—that is, a new and com-pletely different mode of cognitive expression. The epistemological presuppositions that underlie magic and mysticism are not the same as those of the sciences and everyday religion. Among these presup-positions, I would point out the fact that both in magic and in mysti-cism one finds experiential stances in which the boundaries between the subject and the object, on the one hand, and the spiritual and the material, on the other, are eliminated. Saying this, we have to take into consideration the fact that in quantum theory, in psychology, and in religion, similar things are likely to happen. Thus, in magic and mysticism we not only move into utterly new modes of expression, but also into alternate states of elevated empiricism. We may allude to them as entailing extra-empirical modes of existence and, hence, of communication.Next, we move to the magical recipe. Here, those familiar with magic reach familiar territory. One is told to take “a white cock and fine cereal flour; then slaughter the cock in living water.” Living water is water drawn from a flowing source used, for instance, in the cleansing 16 See Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Grammar (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1974), p. 191."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  175ritual of lepers (Lev 14: 5–6).17 There the priest takes two birds and slaughters one of them, letting the blood flow into an urn filled with living water. This special mix is sprinkled on the leper and not used, as in the case of the magical practice, for the baking purposes to which we shall immediately turn. The instructions read as follows: “Knead the flour with the water and the blood, make three cakes, and then place them in the sun.” On its face value, this looks like a sacrificial rite, familiar to those who have studied magical rites. However, the mixing of blood with water is not a familiar rite in Judaic religion, let alone magic. Hence its application here requires a few comments. On the one hand, the blood is diluted in water; on the other, the water is given a blood-like look. Scripture often mentions the fact that both blood and water are, separately though, instrumental in bring-ing about physical and moral purification. Reasonably, the mixing of blood and water wishes to accomplish, on the pre-active level, two complementary aims: enhancing the respective efficacy of these ele-ments and assuring that the magical act will successfully create love between two people.Although the person in question expresses his willingness to speak with the moon and the stars, the sun is the functional factor in the charm. The food ingredients, which he prepares, are exposed to “the sun” to dry and become cakes, that is, bonded wholes. As indicated, neither oven nor fire is mentioned. The heat of the sun does not equal a pot or any other cooking ware placed on a fire. However, its heat can be used to dry or harden food. Furthermore, the sun, which is “the big light,” is here used as the channel through which the request to the “smaller lights,” the moon and the stars, is transmitted. Finally, the cakes are stored away in a place hidden from the sun. This act, which marks the completion of this part of the ritual, involves the typical locale of darkness, so familiar to students of magic.The whole ritual entails a kind of logic that requires explanation. To me, the shift from the moon and the stars to the sun introduces the factor of change, which in itself is an essential element in magic and in the rituals that accompany it. We have already referred to the factor of transformation. It consists of changes of various kinds. If one 17 In this paper, I shall limit myself, as much as I can, to explicit examples from the Hebrew Scriptures. I do so in order to show the interesting points of contact that magical practices have with forms of institutionalized, normative, religion. I believe that this procedure has paradigmatic implications for this study."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"176  ithamar  gruenwaldaccepts the characterization—namely, that magic is the art of effica-ciously causing changes to happen in a manner in which they cannot happen in ordinary life—then the shift of role the luminaries are made to play, or signify, as mentioned above, is significant.In this connection, it is worth reiterating that the word “sacrifice” is not mentioned in the material quoted above. Fire, which is essential to any sacrificial rite, is altogether missing from the ritual scene. This suggests to me that what we encounter here, as in many magical acts, is a sui generis mode of ritual(s) connected to a sui generis event. Magi-cal acts activate modes of behavior and events that are configured in the spells that follow the pro-active rituals. In our case, fire does not belong in the preparatory parts. It forges the core of the emotional shift that is the purpose of the magical act. However, one should notice that the fire here is intended to work in two opposing directions. The person who wishes to bring into effect the desired change turns to the moon and the stars and asks them to “place fire from your fire in the heart of this N or that N so she will abandon the house of her father and mother, because of love for this N son of N.” The added italics tell the whole story, moving from one pole to the other. On the one hand, there is fire that causes abandonment and, on the other, the love that creates unity.One should note, though, that the emotional aspect of the charm is expressed in terms that describe the formation of astrophysical proximity:Bring the constellation of N and his star near to the star and constella-tion of N, so that his love will be tied with the heart of N son of N.In other words, magic causes the physical to have an effect on the spiritual-emotional and, vice versa, the spiritual to effect the material.Although the ritual begins with an act of slaughtering, much of it prescribes the mixing of various ingredients and of making them into a cake. In my view, these acts are no sacrificial gestures to please or win the attention of the angels and the other elements adjured in the magical act. Instead, I believe that the mixing indicates a pro-active stance—namely, of bringing together. The various ingredients are brought to a condition in which they make three separate wholes—that is, the cakes mentioned in the text. They are not consumed in any ritual way. On the contrary, at the very end of the first part of the spell, there is a prescription to store away two of the three cakes. This brings"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  177us to a more crucial question: Does this mean that the cakes that are “baked” in the sun, and then stored away in a place that is not exposed to the sun, indicate a process leading from creation to annihilation? Or does the separation of two out of three cakes indicate that a choice or selection is involved? Annihilating gestures, either of two or one as the case might be, are a central component in many rituals and in those connected with magic, in particular.In the case under discussion, the edibles are not consumed in the usual manner, to sustain the body and preserve it from deterioration. Instead, they are stored away in the shade—that is, they are destined to decay (?) in hiding. Whether this is the case here or not, the factor of annihilation may be viewed as entering through the back door. Is it done in order to avoid annihilation to happen in real life? In other words, does it have apotropaic functions? This is not an easy ques-tion to answer. This act may of course have an apotropaic or substi-tutional function, but it may equally have a pro-active, or pre-active, function. In pro-active cases, annihilation epitomizes what happens in the magical act: a temporary suspension, or cancellation, of the laws of nature. Such a suspension may indeed indicate some kind of disorder or disturbance that in the eyes of people may amount to annihilation.As the charm we are studying shows, changing the location of the constellations in favor of a person who wishes to find love with another one clearly indicates such an ad hoc suspension of the laws of nature. It should be noted, though, that annihilating acts are performed in the course of many festivities. Notable examples are the breaking of plates at the doorsteps of the families that celebrate betrothals, and in Jew-ish weddings, the breaking of a glass underneath the wedding canopy. More will be said on this matter later on.There is another enigmatic segment in this ritual. The names of the relevant angels should be written with the blood of the cock on the cakes that have been made with the same blood mixed with the liv-ing water. Writing the names of angels and other magical powers is a commonly known way of conjuring them. There are two principal ways of adjuring, or conjuring, angelic beings, either by naming them or by writing their names. At times, this may involve secretly held ways of pronouncing them either from texts or from written scripts. Writing, or even drawing their schematic figure, is probably the more potent way of the two, more than just pronouncing the names orally."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"178  ithamar  gruenwaldIn some cases, the written names are put in water, making the waters magically potent.18In my view, all these cases epitomize the factor of making the angelic or demonic beings present and, consequently, at hand to assist or pro-tect the magician. While in biblical literature angelic beings appear spontaneously, in post-biblical literature—in apocalypticism, magic and Merkavah mysticism—their names are uttered, or written, in order to coerce them to make themselves present. Their very presence is vital to the success of the performance. Typically, magical artifacts like amulets, bowls and even parts of the human body are covered with such names. In a way, the artifacts carrying the names are like a stage on which these beings live their performative lives in a visibly poten-cy-enhancing manner. The artifacts provide a working space without which the efficacy of the ritual is likely to dissipate. The material arti-facts bind the names of the angelic beings to the material platform on which they cannot but act to the requests of the owner. These names do not always have a familiar ring, a fact that has given rise to various speculations about the nature of their names and the contextual and cultural forms of diversification which these names project.In any event, these comments point to the existence of a cognitive cosmos that is utterly different from the one we are accustomed to experiencing in everyday life. This cosmos unfolds as a cognitive real-ity the parameters of which are definable by a variety of factors, most prominently in rituals and their respective ritual theory in their appli-cability to magic and Merkavah mysticism. An experiential bridge connects between this reality and ordinary life. The magical and mysti-cal practices create this bridge in a manner that only the magician and the mystic seem to be able to handle and to sustain epistemologically. For the magicians and the mystics alike the existence of these kinds of cosmos creates no problem. On the contrary, they believe that they thrive in them and can bring into effect their respective initiatives to shape them as the center of the special experiences that they control. In them they can display their professional proficiency. Crossing the 18 A notable example is Num 5: 21–24, where the Sotah (allegedly wayward) woman is told to drink the water which contains the diluted priestly curse. For a discussion of this ritual, and the assumption that it was never done, see, Ishay Rosen-Zvi, The Rite that Was Not: Temple, Midrash, and Gender in Tractate Sotah [in Hebrew], (Jerusa-lem, 2008)."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  179borders between one mode of reality and the other is part of their respective art.The factor of coercion, whether on the level of making the angelic beings present or of forcing them to do the will of the people address-ing them, signifies a new stage in the development of the religion of Ancient Israel. In as much as Scripture induces the impression that divine intercession is the unique prerogative of the divine, in magic divine powers are no longer free to decide for themselves. They depend on what is done by the humans who are in need of getting their coop-eration. What should draw our attention in the charm under discus-sion, though, is the fact that the cakes with the names of the conjured angels on them are doomed to disintegrate and decay. This is not the only case we know of in which such a procedure that leads to disinte-gration and annihilation takes place in magical rituals. However, what does all this mean? Does it mean that the presence of these angelic or demonic beings is doomed to dissolve into non-beings, or to return to their original place? Those who make them present are also the ones who cause their disappearance. I believe that the essence of the two parts of this particular ritual is the fact that the special names, con-jured for any particular magical act, are usable for no other purpose than the one for which they are conjured. They cannot be used for any other purpose or on any other occasion, however similar they might be to the original one. They are exclusively used for one particular act and purpose.If the last comments make sense, then we may reach the conclusion that magical rituals and acts are ad hoc events. They are potent only for the purpose for which they are prescribed and done. This may explain the fact that we possess so many magical texts and rituals. No amu-let written for one person is useable for the needs of another person. Duplication and reproduction render the artifact produced powerless. This explains the fact that preferably one needs direct contact with the magical craftsman who writes the amulet, the inscription on the bowl, and the person performing the act of exorcism. It is a personal contact marking the ad hoc and ad hominem commission created in the special contact between the expert and the user.1919 The same holds true of miracles. At one time Moses is told to beat the stone (tsur) in order to extract water from it (Ex 17:6); at another time, he has to speak to the rock (sel`a), while beating it was a fatal sin (Num 20: 8–10)."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"180  ithamar  gruenwaldFinally, before the adjuration is said, the magician is told to put the cakes on a table made of myrtle wood, and then—as is often the case—direct his face to the adjured objects. In religion, seeing the god/god-dess means that one is also seen by him/her. This empathic encounter is the essence of pilgrimage and of visits paid to temples.20 This fact may be explained on a number of levels, including psychoanalytic ones. Space constraints prevent me from doing so. However, I intend to publish my findings on this subject in the near future.A word is also due about the “table made of myrtle wood.” One can write detailed studies on the flora and fauna used in magic. The myrtle—in Hebrew, הדס—is a plant used in various rituals. The closest connection I can find here in terms of ritual theory is the statement made by Pliny to the effect that the myrtle tree and marriages are under the auspices of Venus, the Roman goddess of love.21 In rab-binic literature, the branches of the הדס are used as the crowns tied to the heads of bridegrooms.22 Myrtle branches have additional uses in betrothal and wedding festivities. Thus, if we keep in mind the fact that the main body of the adjuration is about the joining in love of two people, the myrtle emphatically shows the extent to which the rituals and their various segments are integrated into the essence of the magical act. They are not arbitrary superimpositions that create the formal frame.VThe center of the adjuration consists of two parts. The first one expresses the wish “to bring the constellation of N and his star to the star and the constellation of N, so his love will be tied to the heart of 20 Pilgrimage [to the Jerusalem Temple] is technically referred to as “seeing.” The proof texts that the Talmudic rabbis use in this case is Ex 23: 17: “Three times in the year all your males should be seen in [lit. to] the face of the Lord God.” The Talmud, Bav. Sanhedrin 4/b, quotes Rabbi Yohanan ben Dehavai in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima: “A person with a blind eye is exempt from ‘seeing’; as it is said (Ex 23: 17) ‘shall be seen’—in the manner that he comes to see he also comes to be seen. As the act of seeing means [using] both of one’s eyes, so the act of being seen means with two eyes.” Since God is physically perfect, those who come to see Him must be physically whole, too. No wonder, then, that the facial depiction of idols and effigies in many religions are marked by big and open eyes.21 Pliny, Historia Naturalis, 15.29, 2; 35–38.22 Tosefta Sotah 15: 8."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  181N son of N.” Evidently, this part has a strong astrological component. The zodiac and its constellations play a major role in the religions of the ancient world. One does not have to look for the extravagance of magical performances to find a heavy astrological influence in ancient religion. There is also plenty of rabbinical and extra-rabbinical mate-rial on this issue. The floor mosaics in ancient synagogues just repeat the familiar story. What has magic to do with all this? It purports to be able to change the course of the stars and relocate the constellations, something that is not straightforwardly indicated in the mosaics and the relevant rabbinic texts. In other words, it causes spectacular trans-formations to happen on the cosmic level.23 These transformations are conditional to what follows. “Place fire from your fire of this N or that so that she will abandon her father’s and mother’s home because of love for this N son of N.” The two parts of the adjuration show some confu-sion in the use of gender. This gave rise to the speculation that homo-sexual love is included. In any event, what is described in the Book of Genesis 2: 24 as the natural procedure between lovers—“Therefore, a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves to his spouse, and they become one flesh”—is here viewed as requiring magical intervention, apparently because the person who is to leave the parents’ home is a woman who has to disobey her parents’ wish.In its magical context, the notion of abandoning the parents’ home, as referred to in this adjuration, looks to me to be more dramatic than the way-of-the-world kind of reference to leaving one’s parental home, as mentioned in the Book of Genesis. The drama is created by an act of placing fire in the heart of the beloved person. Fire (in Hebrew: אש) may, in this case, be a metaphorical expression of lust and passion, but it may also be a play on the term איש (man) used in the Book of Gen-esis. In any event, the adjuration sounds to me as if it wishes to bring about, in the first place, a break between the loving person and her par-ents. As indicated above, the parents may have expressed their objec-tion to the love and the resulting marriage. In other words, the act of slaughtering in the anticipatory ritual creates a perfect symbiosis with 23 Relevant to this discussion is Meir Bar-Ilan, Astrology and the Other Sciences Among the Jews of Israel in the Roman-Hellenistic and Byzantine Periods [in Hebrew], (Jerusalem, 2010). Bar-Ilan deals mainly with Sefer Yetzirah (“The Book of Creation”), but the material he discusses may be used in the context of the present discussion. Less relevant, but still adding interesting aspects to the discussion, is Attilio Mastrocinque, From Jewish Magic to Gnosticism (Tübingen, 2005)."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"182  ithamar  gruenwaldthe magically induced departure from the parents’ home. Thus, cutting the cock’s throat is a first act in the coherently developing drama. In that drama, separation—a drastically enacted transformation—is the key issue. Yet, it is physically anticipated in the realms of the heavenly stars and constellations.The whole event ends when two of the cakes and the cock are put in a sealed flask, storing them away in a “place not exposed to the sun.” The sunless environment fits well with the opening line: “If you wish to speak with the moon or the stars.” The fact that the sun, too, is involved may be indicative of the fact that when magic is concerned, no logical rules necessarily prevail. Even when a specific time and place are indicated, the magical act is a map with no fixed boundaries.A final issue, in this respect, is the one that relates to the third cake: What does the magician do with it? Two answers suggest themselves to the question. One is rather speculative, but gives a chance to raise a point, in principle. It may be argued that three parties were involved—the third one, apparently, either the parents or an unknown lover from whom the woman’s mind or love must be distracted. That party must be extracted from the scene. Thus, putting the third cake aside signi-fies a pro-active act. On the speculative level, another explanation may suggest itself as a possible solution. We have already referred to the ritual of cleansing the leper in the Book of Leviticus 14. The priest has to take two birds, one of which he slaughters over “living water” and the other one he sends to seek its freedom. Sacrificial acts entail a choice between two elements, one of which is sometimes not used for any ritual purposes. In Lev 16 the priest takes two goats, one of which is slaughtered, the other sent into the desert.24 A somewhat similar procedure is known from the Temple service in Jerusalem, where the unused blood of the sacrifices is allowed to drain into the earth. Fur-thermore, in the Book of Judges 6, Gideon brings a sacrificial offer-ing to the angel, and the angel tells him to put it all on the rock, to be later on devoured by fire. However, the angel tells Gideon to spill away the soup that he has brought. In other words, one may argue that not everything that is a part of the intended sacrificial “meal” is used. The sacrificial prescriptions in the Book of Leviticus are full of 24 The reader may find a detailed analysis of this procedure in my book, Rituals and Ritual Theory in Ancient Israel, Chapter Five."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  183such examples. There is always more than is needed for the sacrificial act to fulfill its tasks.However, the text of Sefer Ha-Razim thinks of the matter in completely different terms. It adds another part to the previous magi-cal act.II. If it concerns an act of loving kindness (gemilut hasadim), take the remaining cake, crumble it into aged wine in a glass cup, and say the names of the angels in face of the moon and the stars, using these words:I adjure you that you will give favor, graceful kindness, and affection that radiate from your face, I, N. son of N., so that I will find favor, kindness, affection and honor in the eyes of every man.Then blow into the wind and wash your face each dawn, for nine days, with the wine and the cake crumbled in it.The logical connection of this part to the passage quoted above is far from clear. Were it not for the prescription regarding the third cake, it may have looked as an altogether artificial annex. Let us, for the sake of the argument, see this passage as an integral part of the whole, and discuss it accordingly.The blood mentioned in the first part is no longer mentioned here. Instead, one finds old wine in a glass cup into which the third cake is crumbled. If Temple rituals are relevant to the understating of magical rituals, then one may infer from the Minha sacrifice (cereal offering) that the crucial stages in doing it properly are mixing it with oil, bak-ing it, and then crumbling it and pouring oil on it:And if your offering is a cereal offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil; you shall break it in pieces, and pour oil on it; it is a cereal offering (Lev 2: 5–6).No wine is mentioned in this connection. Generally speaking, though, various rabbinic sources indicate that aged wine is preferable to new wine. However, in line with the comments on ritual theory made above, the act of crumbling baked edibles marks disintegration, frag-mentation and in a sense even destruction. If this is the case, what is the causal connection between those elements and the magical act in which a person adjures the angels to “find favor, kindness, affection and honor in the eyes of every man”? A reasonable answer, in this case, may be that a pre-active act has to eliminate the reverse of kind-ness and favor before the desired qualities can become effective."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"184  ithamar  gruenwaldFurthermore, smearing blood and red colors is known from the magical practices in various cultures. Wine, probably red wine is meant, is more rarely used. The cake that was prepared with the blood of the cock is now crumbled and mixed with aged wine. On top of all this unique procedure, the person involved is told to “blow into the wind and wash your face each dawn, for nine days, with the wine and the cake crumbled in it.” It should be noted that neither the cake nor the wine are consumed as edibles. Furthermore, they are not offered to the angels. Their major use is for cosmetic decoration or to induce the element of disguising oneself.What does all this signify? In my view, the key to understanding this ritual and its embedded theory is in the remarkable connection between the face of the moon and the stars, the affectionate quali-ties visible on the face of the angels, and the face of the person who wants to find various kinds of favorable attitudes in the eyes (= face) of others. Smearing the wine with the crumbled cake on the face of the person involved covers his own face and directs all the attention on the other faces mentioned here. Is this the only way of attracting the facial expression in the manner mentioned in the charm? I believe that the question is not relevant to our discussion, since we have to explain the ritual at hand and not the potential ones that we do not know. However, I do not believe that the mixing of a baked cake with wine has a “Eucharistic” effect or resemblance.VII would like to add a few comments on the nature of the magical materials in the Hekhalot writings.25 For reasons that have a history of their own, scholars often prefer to refer to these magical elements by a variety of terms, chief among them being the one that invokes the neo-platonic notion of theurgy. This term has received various interpreta-tions, the chief one of which speaks of applying methods to induce the gods to do things that require magic-like means.One should be reminded, at this point, that in Merkavah mysti-cism the magical or theurgic acts are not used to cause changes in other people or objects. In most cases, they prepare (transform?) the 25 Most of the materials referred to in this part of the paper were discussed in Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"  methodological  considerations  185mystic for the kind of experiences he wishes to have. Basically, the preparations include avoidance of wine, certain vegetables and meat. This ascetic diet is carried out for a certain number of weeks, usually three weeks. Purifying ablutions are added and the mystics are told to pronounce the names of angels and their secret appellations. These procedures are also known from apocalyptic literature; some of them are mentioned already in the Hebrew parts of the Book of Daniel. In later Kabbalah writings other ritual procedures are mentioned.26The point here is to enter a state of consciousness that facilitates the mystical experience. Several studies published in the last twenty-five or thirty years contain detailed discussions of magical and theurgic rituals, particularly in the context of empowering acts. Both the mystic and the magician have to empower themselves, but they also empower the acts they are doing and the practices they are told to undergo. In this context, the issue of incantations and adjurations, which belong within the sphere lately referred to by Fritz Graf as “Words and Acts,”27 play a vital role. The acts connected with empowerment are believed to be potent in their own right. They belong to the very heart of the mat-ter. However, the general approach applied in most of the studies with which I am familiar is mostly descriptive. In many cases, though not in all of them, the discussions unfold in the sphere of the comparative phenomenology of religion and ritual practice. Rarely is the subject of these practices taken up in the doing aspects, which are vital for any systematic attempt to develop the methodology of studying them in relation to the nature of magical efficacy.As I have indicated above, my approach is informed by anthropol-ogy. Anthropology, in this respect, has opened up to me interesting channels of approaching and assessing rituals in their doing aspects. In that context, metaphors, symbolism and theology lose much of their practical and methodological relevance. However, I would like to stress that my approach is informed by a careful analysis of textual prescrip-tions rather than by fieldwork and actual practice. In this respect, it has a more philosophical nature than that gained in fieldwork.26 Most of them were discussed by Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven and London, 1988).27 Fritz Graf, Magic in the Ancient World (Cambridge, Mass. and London, 1994), pp. 205–233. See also Hans Dieter Betz, The “Mithras Liturgy” (Tübingen, 2003), p. 119, who, typically for such discussions, laconically remarks, “As far as speech is concerned, the voces magicae empower it to make sure the prayer is being heard.”"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"186  ithamar  gruenwaldIn this sense, I can point to significant results with regard to the kind of methodological oeuvre offered in the present study. If one argues that mysticism evolves in alternate states of consciousness, and magic, too, unfolds in almost similar conditions though of a different nature and with different goals, then the foundations have been laid for functional comparisons between the two—whether in a divergent or a convergent context. At stake are the special rituals, which are not used in the common practice of religion. These rituals assume an efficacious thrust that surpasses the capacity of normal human beings, both to perform and to achieve. In the framework of this efficacious thrust, things that other humans are incapable of accomplishing look achievable. As has been indicated above, one has to accept as realiz-able matters that in the eyes of many people defy modes of rationality and empirical experience. The way to account for them derives from the understanding of rituals and ritual theory in normal modes of life, in religion, and in more technically oriented fields. When it comes to mysticism and magic, a heavier strain on our scholarly imagination is required than in matters that are familiar to us from their occurrence in daily life. However, if stretching our imagination beyond certain experiential limits is the only effort we are required to show, then the gains are surely worth the effort."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"TRANSMISSION AND TRANSFORMATION OF SPELLS:THE CASE OF THE JEWISH BABYLONIAN ARAMAIC BOWLS1Shaul ShakedThe Aramaic magic bowls from Mesopotamia do not contain names of authors, nor do they have references to sources from which the authors of these texts culled their materials. They contain, as a rule, the names of their owners, people for whom they were prepared; a few of them have dates, very few have names that can be assigned to histori-cal figures, and very few indeed, if any, give us a hint as to their place of provenance. And yet, we may already be in a position at this stage to enquire what sources the authors of the texts used, how they learned their texts and how they transmitted them, and what is the structure of a text. The information is not explicit in the texts; it must be teased out of them, and the conclusions are at this stage merely tentative.The authors of the Jewish bowl texts use among their sources the corpus of the Hebrew Bible, which they often quote, as a rule in the original Hebrew, rarely in an Aramaic version, including the Onkelos Targum; and in some cases Mishna passages, but so far we know only of such passages which were incorporated in the Jewish daily liturgy.2 They also use non-canonical texts which form part of the Jewish liturgy, such as the formula known as Qeriʾat šemaʿ ʿal hammiṭṭa, the prayer before going to sleep, with an invocation of angels who stand on all sides of the person for protection; they sometimes quote passages of Hekhalot compositions and of poetic pieces which may have belonged to the same genre; and they give evidence of their acquaintance with the midrashic literature, sometimes alluding to otherwise unattested midrashim. The authors of the bowl texts were clearly familiar with a wide array of Jewish source material. This may give us an idea as to the range of literature that formed part of the Jewish religious discourse 1 The present contribution is part of a series started by Shaked 1999a. The first paper in this series was published under the title “Poetics of Spells” in Shaked (1999a). Other items in this series are listed in Shaked (2006). I wish to thank Yuval Harari for his careful reading of a draft of this paper and for helpful comments.2 For Mishna passages incorporated in the Jewish prayer book cf. Shaked 2005:4–5."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"188  shaul  shakedof the period. If we add to this the fact that the names of owners of some bowls are adorned with the title “rabbi”, a form of address which in all likelihood was not employed lightly at that time,3 one gets an impression of how much the literary and religious activity represented by the magic bowls was embedded in the Jewish tradi-tion. At the same time it is evident that the people who composed the texts of the bowls were open to non-Jewish environment, including Mandaean,4 Christian,5 and to some degree also Iranian,6 and often to vestiges of older Babylonian elements7 which must have been still alive in late antique Babylonia.We are here particularly interested in the ways in which the texts were composed and transmitted. One way of arriving at this informa-tion is to arrange the texts in thematic groups and identify bowl texts which have the same formula, even if what we call the “same” is never quite identical. Each bowl is written at the order of a specific client, and is in its way an independent composition. We can thus try to understand the degree of fidelity in the transmission of the text, on the one hand, and, on the other, the text variations in different bowls, thus perhaps discovering the limits implicitly imposed on the freedom to invent new expressions, new motifs and new combinations.We shall have to introduce into our enquiry some new terms, which, in order to serve our purposes, should be given precise and unequivo-cal definitions. The text of a bowl will be called an incantation. An incantation may consist of one or more segments (which we shall call “spells”), and these can turn up on occasion in other incantations as well.A spell reflects, with greater or lesser fidelity, what I should like to call a formula. This term denotes an ideal structure of a text which the practitioner aims at reproducing. A formula may be envisioned as the text that could have been placed in a carefully written model book of spells, even though no such composition is known to have existed 3 Such texts will be published in a separate study.4 The influence of Mandaic elements on JBA magic texts has been pointed out chiefly by Ch. Müller-Kessler (1999a) and other publications. 5 The Christian element is explicitly present in the few bowls where the trinity is invoked; cf. Levene 1999, and Shaked 1999b. Other unpublished bowls with similar formulae have been noticed.6 On the Iranian elements see Shaked 1985, 1997.7 Cf. Ch. Müller-Kessler 1999b."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" transmission and transformation of spells 189in Sasanian Babylonia.8 A formula is thus a construct, not a concrete text. Borrowing an idea from linguistics, a formula would represent the langue, while a spell, which constitutes the performance of a for-mula, corresponds to the parole of the text.As indicated above, an incantation as written in a bowl is usually made up of one or several spells, which serve as its building blocks. If there are several spells in an incantation, each one represents a differ-ent formula. Each spell (and its corresponding formula) will be given a name for the convenience of our discussion. In the example given below, three bowls share one spell: “I descended to the depths of the earth,” a name derived from the opening words of the spell. Bowl I contains only this major spell (marked in our table by the letter C). Bowl II makes also use of the spell which we call “The great primor-dial father” (G). Bowl III introduces instead two other spells: “Shkobit Shkobita” (H), and “Your countenance is that of a vile creature” (J). A spell is, in principle, an adaptation or a quotation of a formula, but an incantation is as a rule a larger composition; it typically contains, in addition to the spell(s), introductory and concluding segments, and various other elements which will be mentioned below.Segments are phrases or sections to which a spell can be subdivided. Segments can also fulfil structural functions in the incantation outside the spell texts. They can, for example, introduce a text of the incanta-tion or of a spell (cf. A and B in the table below); form a textual bridge between spells (cf. D and F in the table below), conclude an incanta-tion (J5 in the table below), or present an independent invocation. In a given incantation, the order of the segments may undergo a trans-formation when compared to a parallel incantation on another bowl. Our ability to reconstruct a formula depends to a large extent on the stability and consistency of the segments in different parallel bowls.The term invocation means a direct appeal to different powers or persons,9 sometimes with a supplication that they should act in a manner sought by the practitioner or the client. In the Table below, 8 Such collections of spells are quite well attested from the Cairo Geniza, and sev-eral examples can be found in the two volumes by Naveh and Shaked (1985, 1993) and in the volumes of Schäfer and Shaked (1994, 1997, 1999). The various composi-tions going under such names as Šimmuš Tehillim, Sefer ha-Razim, or Ḥarba de-Moše, which no doubt belong to an age earlier than most Geniza documents, belong also to this genre, but they should be assigned to the Palestinian, rather than the Babylonian, tradition. On these books cf. Bohak 2008:169ff.; Harari 2010:200–225.9 For this term see further below."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"190  shaul  shakedB, E, H4 and J5 provide examples for invocations embedded in the incantation.We shall reserve the use of the term theme to the main contents of an incantation or a spell. The theme of the divorce document served on the demons,10 a widespread topic which appears in several bowl texts, might serve here as an example.The term motif will designate the contents of a magical story (or historiola). Here we may quote as an example the story of Semamit (a female person designated as a lizard or a spider)11 who gave birth to twelve children and lost them to the evil Sideros (a mythical person the meaning of whose name is “Iron”). With the motifs, as with the themes, a certain fluidity in the phrasing and in the order of the seg-ments is often observed. There is however a difference in the mode of functioning of motifs as opposed to themes: the same theme can under-lie different spells, but not all the divorce texts, for example, can be described as deriving from the same formula. All texts with the same motif, e.g. the story of Semamit or that of R. Ḥanina ben Dosa, may however be claimed to be variants of the same basic spell or formula.The term person indicates the various entities which come up in the texts, whether they are human or animal figures, whether they are divine or demonic, whether they are historically attested, mythi-cal or fantastic. Examples for persons are Semamit, King Solomon, Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa, or any of the large number of entities using divine names, or carrying angel or demonic names, that come up in the formulae.A practitioner is someone who composes, transmits or copies an incantation, or one who engages in any other activity connected with the magic practice. A client is a person who orders the text to be written and his name to be inserted in it, and who owns the bowl. The client is the person for whom the incantation seeks health, well being, success in business, society, or love relationship, or who aims to achieve victory over enemies. The practitioner and the client can con-ceivably be in some cases a single person, but one gets the impression 10 Cf. Shaked 1999a. 11 Cf. Naveh and Shaked (1985) (= AMB, B12). Spells based on the same for-mula occur elsewhere as well; cf. Oelsner (1989); Müller-Kessler (1994); and Hunter (1995:69–65), for a brief discussion of the incantation in the bowl from Nippur, 18 N 98."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" transmission and transformation of spells 191that as a rule the practitioner acts as a professional who offers services to clients.The term formula denotes in our discussion, as has already been noted, the ideal form of a spell. We may aim at reconstructing a for-mula on the basis of text variants, but in many cases we shall have to admit our inability to reconstruct the ideal form which lies behind the spells. Two or more textual variants attested in parallel bowl texts are often equally valid, and the researcher has no way of forming a pref-erence. This inability may point to a deeper structural feature of the genre of incantations, for the practitioners are conventionally allowed a certain freedom in moulding the text they are using according to their personal preference. In practice however the range of variation is rather limited, and it does not look as if the practitioner is free from restrictions.It is to be hoped that a consistent use of this terminology will make our discourse somewhat clearer. In order to examine the usefulness of this terminology we shall analyze three sample texts. The examples presented in the table below show how one formula comes up as a spell in three different incantations, and how other formulae are asso-ciated with it in some of the parallel incantations.12 It will be seen from this presentation: (1) that a formula can be used in different incanta-tions on its own, or in company with other formulae; and (2) that segments outside the spells serve several aims: as a link between the spells, to identify the clients, to incorporate invocations and biblical quotations, and so on.It may be noted that all three bowls were made for the same per-son, a lady by the name of Māhdukh(t) daughter of Nēwāndukh(t),13 12 The formula is attested also in other incantations, but quoting too many variants may not be helpful for this discussion.13 The two names, that of the client as well as that of her mother, are Persian. The client’s name can be rendered “daughter of the Moon (god)”; her mother’s name means “daughter of the brave.” The name is usually spelled without the final t, reflecting no doubt the actual pronunciation of the word. Māhdukh(t) daughter of Nēwāndukh(t) is recorded as the owner of some 34 bowls in the Schøyen Collection (in three cases the attribution is uncertain), as well as of about six bowls in the Moussaieff Collection. To this large number there may be added a further number of bowls made for other members of her family, e.g. Burzaq son of Mahdukh (who has four bowls under his name in the Schøyen Collection, and two in the Moussaieff Collection). That this cli-ent is the son of our Mahdukh seems likely, judging by the quality of the writing and by the handwriting itself, which seems to stem from the same scribal school, if not from the same scribe. The bowls of Burzaq are also close to those of Mahdukh in the sense that they share the same spells as the latter. As bowls are rather fragile and often"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"192  shaul  shakedand quite possibly by the same scribe. The fact that the bowls were manufactured for a single person and perhaps in the same workshop may arguably diminish from the usefulness of this comparison. The variations seen in the different spells however indicate the degree of freedom in the transmission of the texts even within such a closed circle of texts. This stands in contrast to the practice of manuscript copyists. The bowl texts do not always display the same degree of care as manuscript copies, but in our case they carry texts that are so close to those in the parallel bowls that one can’t help feeling that copying from a written model is nevertheless involved.14Three incantations comparedpoorly preserved, and as some of the bowls prepared for this lady may have found their way to unknown private collections, it may be assumed that the total number of bowls made out for Mahdukh daughter of Newandukh was even larger. The fact that the bowls are so widely dispersed is partly the result of the undertaking of museums and public institutions not to acquire unprovenanced ancient artifacts. The wisdom of this policy may be questioned. It is uncertain whether this can stop illegal digging, but it will certainly cause a loss of precious evidence. 14 On the mode of transmission of bowl texts cf. also Müller-Kessler 1994:8–9; Lev-ene 2003:24–30; Häberl (forthcoming).15 The Aramaic text is in Appendix 1. See Plate 1. The line divisions are given in parentheses in each of the three bowls.16 The Aramaic text is in Appendix 2. See Plates 2–4.17 The Aramaic text is in Appendix 3.

The sense of the phrase remains obscure. hnyh could also be taken to be a nomen actionis from HNY, like bʿyʾ, ksyʾ, zkyʾ etc. The phrase could be rendered: “There is no enjoyment to these, and no enjoyment to these”.

That the sections A and E are not part of the spell can be seen by the fact that they are not present in the parallel texts; the parallel invocations have different sections in this place, or none at all.28 The essential part of the spell contained in section C is a text which is known from several other bowls, and must have been quite popular. It is attested in something like half a dozen bowls in the Schøyen Collection, and possibly in fur-ther unpublished texts. The main theme of the spell in section C is a vision recounted in the first person singular, and it has the form of a rather elaborate historiola.The occurrence of so many parallel texts is a mixed boon. It enables us to correct and supplement the readings of the badly faded text, and reach something like a satisfactory edition and translation. At the same time it makes the preparation of a critical text so much more complicated.29 The existence of several parallel texts for most spells is exceptional in the history of magic texts of Antiquity. The Cairo Geniza provides a somewhat similar abundance, although the spells used in Geniza texts are generally not the same as those found in the bowls.30 The interest of the large corpus of bowls lies precisely in its repetitiveness, which affords the possibility to study the methods of transmission; it also lies, paradoxically, in the diversity found within this mass of repetitive material.The spell in section C is based on a vision. Although it is introduced in the first person singular, this is not an individual experience. The speaker is not identical with the person who writes the present bowl, but is an anonymous author who serves as a prototype with whom the practitioner and client can identify. The aim of the incantation is obvi-ously the protection of the children of the house. The identity of the hostile person is not specified in the text; he remains a rather nebu-lous character. His action is done by four large “animals” or “ animate 28 The invocation in section A, which is a common opening text in many bowls, occurs in an expanded form also in Bowl III.29 The fluidity of the texts makes them less amenable to being edited by simply noting variants of orthography or word order, as is done in the regular treatment of manuscript texts.30 On this point see Shaked 2006."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"200  shaul  shakedbeings” (ḥayyot), that are “sent” against the children, but it is not spec-ified by whom. They act like a lion who snatches, strangles, crushes the bones and devours the children. In terms of contemporary children’s stories this is reminiscent of a Gruffalo,31 or perhaps rather, the Afri-can monster in Chukovski’s Russian kids’ tale.32 Unlike the monster of the modern stories, the lion-like figures in the spell do not have a change of heart, or undergo a transformation which causes them to start loving children. They need to be chased away and prevented from pursuing their horrific deeds.The vision and the historiola framework are not meant to repre-sent an individual experience, but are part of a liturgical convention of incantation writing. This spell gets its force from the narration of the vision seen and the voices heard; they are made to be present as an experience that could have been undergone by the practitioner or the owner. It does not seem likely that the practitioner would have tried personally to replicate the experience of the vision and the voices, although this is not entirely excluded. The vision is essentially brought to life by the narration; the retelling of the historiola makes the experi-ence real, present and effective on each occasion at which the spell is written or recited. In this sense, the story falls within the same bracket as any religious ceremony in which an event of great significance is recounted, as for example in the Passover eve gathering in which the events of the Exodus are recited and, in some Jewish traditions, also enacted.The positive figure in the story is a voice belonging to an invis-ible person, who presents himself as an angel, called Segan (or, as in Bowl 1:4, Segai), a designation which refers to a position of power and authority. The angel, appropriately enough, resides inside the electrum, a rarefied atmospheric substance which presumably surrounds the deity.The historiola is quite elaborate and contains a story within a story. The practitioner tells of an audial experience, the result of his descent to the deep foundations of the earth; there he hears the voice which comes out of the ether-like envelope of the deity. The angel speaker 31 Written by Julia Donaldson and first published in the UK in 1999. The Gruffalo does not entirely conform to the image of monstrous animals in the bowls, inasmuch as it is presented as an ambiguous figure: its existence hovers deliberately between that of a playful imaginary invention and that of a real entity. 32 In Kornei Chukovski, Barmalei, first published in the USSR in 1925."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" transmission and transformation of spells 201tells a story of his own: he was sitting on the tombs of the dead and heard women crying. The women, for their part, tell of their vision, where they saw something like clouds, out of which perhaps come four animals. At the end of this story, which operates like a Russian matryoshka doll, in which within each figure another one is hidden, we come to the operative part of the incantation: may you be bound and sealed by the Great Name, by the signet-ring, by the name, by the speech, all of which items refer to different names of the highest deity. The structure of this formula, the fact that it encompasses several lay-ers of embedded stories, is reminiscent, perhaps not accidentally, of the graphic layout of the bowls themselves, where the circular writ-ing embodies several lines of text which are ensconced and wrapped within each other.The movement of the story seems to go downward: “I descended to the depths of the earth.” At a certain point in the text one finds the scene shifting and one encounters the person in the narrative listen-ing to a voice coming from the midst of the electrum. An angel who serves in the presence of the Lord of the Universe joins the narrative. Are we now high up in the divine universe, or are we still in the depth? We then encounter women sitting on graves and describing forms of lightning, of clouds and of living beings, all presumably coming from high up.The spell is marked by this confusing to-and-fro movement on a vertical axis. It is not clear whether the story can be described as an anabasis or a katabasis. It may be supposed that the underground vision and the experience of the upper world are complementary in this narrative.The performative part of the formula begins with section D: “Now, you are bound and sealed by his Great Name, by the signet-ring of the Holy One, by the name of the Supreme One, and by the speech of Shaddai: that you should not harm or injure or damage the children of Mahdukh daughter of Newandukh and those that will be born to her in the future, and everything that exists in the world”.33 Let us recall that Mahdukh daughter of Newandukh is one of the few great tycoons of the bowl world of Babylonia. She and certain members of her family possess a very large collection of bowls.34 This may reflect 33 Quoted from Bowl I.34 See above, note 13."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"202  shaul  shakedthe fact that she is hypochondriac and paranoid, or that she is pious and dedicated to private rituals of this kind, or that she is relatively affluent and feels that having bowls around the house radiated a desir-able social message and a certain kind of power.The historiola which precedes the final section is not a mere intro-duction; it serves to identify the perpetrators of the crime which has to be redressed, for if they are not made known, the work of forcing them to desist cannot be accomplished.The early parts of the inscription serve to prepare the mood. The criminals are not merely introduced, they are presented to the high-est judicial instance, the most powerful authority, the Master of the World. This act serves to instill in them, and possibly also in the human audience, if the text was read out aloud, a feeling of awe and humility. This is enhanced by the dramatic props used: the depths of the earth, the foundations of the universe, the tombs of the dead and the tremors of the earth, which make it possible to gaze into things that are normally hidden.The protagonist is the angel called Segan, a title of administrative or military eminence borrowed from ancient Mesopotamia.35 This angel is the link connecting the two poles, the highest point (the divine pres-ence) with the netherworld. He “stands in the presence of the Master of the World,” and he reports on things heard over the tombs of the dead, which represent the world underneath. Tombs and cemeteries often stand in the language of the bowls for channels enabling humans to communicate with the other world(s). The vision of the women refers in its turn to the upper world: the world of lightning, of clouds and of animated beings, the latter suggesting the animated beings sur-rounding the Throne of Glory. These animals (ḥayyot) are apparently instruments in the hands of the dark powers, although they owe their literary existence to the figures of living beings in the presence of God.36 If this interpretation is correct, the crime committed is not merely a transgression against the proper order of things, but also an act of disobedience, a breaking away of the great animated beings from the subservience which they owe to their divine master. The death of small 35 Petit (1988) and Wiesehöfer (1991) try to interpret the sense of the term segan in the Achaemenian period. As the term occurs also in the Aramaic inscriptions on chert objects from Persepolis, it may be useful to refer to the remarks on this term in Naveh and Shaked (1973).36 Cf., e.g., Ez. 1:13–15."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" transmission and transformation of spells 203children is regarded as a breaking down of the universal order and at the same time as an act of insubordination. Quite appropriately, the names invoked are all different appellations of God, who is called upon in an effort to re-establish the broken order as well as His own authority.The four animal figures are characteristically ambiguous. It is a fea-ture of the incantations that the definition of persons across the divid-ing line between good and evil is left opaque. The animals are close to the source of divine power, but at the same time they seem also to serve the evil powers.The variant texts of this story are quite consistent and show little divergence, and we may tentatively conclude that the spell as trans-mitted may be reasonably close to the urtext, at least as known and quoted within the circle of scribes employed by Mahdukh daughter of Newandukh.The spell “I descended to the depths of the earth” is combined in Bowl II with another one, “The Great Primordial Father.” This is also a popular spell, attested on several different bowls, but much of its meaning is unfortunately obscure.The two formulae grouped together on the same bowl do not seem to be closely related to one another. We may enquire whether the combination of the two was planned, or whether the scribe wrote the first spell, “I descended to the depths of the earth,” then realized that the bowl had some blank space, and decided to put in another spell which he had ready in his memory or somewhere in writing, which he could use to cover the rest of the surface. We need not take a stand on this issue, except in order to observe that the combination of two or more spells in one incantation is by no means rare. This is perhaps due to a certain horror vacui, a reluctance to leave a blank space on the bowl; or to the pecuniary consideration that leaving a blank area may not look good in the eyes of the client, who after all ordered a whole bowl covered by writing. The inner surface of the bowl is usu-ally covered by an insciption or a drawing or both. It was evidently considered important that the surface of the bowl should be utilized in full. It must have been assumed that if there is space available the full arsenal at the disposal of the pratitioner should be brought to bear on the demons.In Bowl III other elements are added to fill up the space. The base spell “I descended to the depths of the earth” is supplemented by two other well-known texts, the spells “Škobit škobita” (in section H), and"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"204  shaul  shaked“Your countenance is that of a vile creature” (Section J). This is fol-lowed by the very common citation of the verse from Zachariah 3:2 (Section J2), which is followed by the reduced writing of Kephalar-gia, the Greek word for “headache” (section J3) and by the text of the Blessing of the Priests, taken from Num. 6:24–26 (Section J4).Other incantations have other elements added to the formula “I descended to the depths of the earth.” Two examples are given in Appendix 4 and 5.These elements are added as a padding to the main text of the incantation, and the same biblical verse is cited in the two examples; it may have been considered particularly appropriate for this formula. It seems that the drawings and large magical characters may have been put on the surface of the bowl before the text was written in, for it seems that the text goes round the drawings.The urge to add textual elements as much as the space allows is sig-nificant. It belongs together with an observation already made: despite the assumption often heard that a magical utterance has a power all its own, it appears that this faith has its limitations. In order to strengthen the incantation, one must resort to repetition, hyperbole and pleo-nasm. The heaping of various formulae indicates that the practitioner wants to throw into the battle all available weapons. If saying a phrase once does not produce the desired effect, saying it twice, or saying it backward, may add power. The power is felt to reside in words, but we do not always know what would be the best order of words, or whether a particular choice of words will bring the result intended. If we say a phrase straight, it may force the demons to run forward and perhaps avoid our grasp; saying it backwards may block their way of escape and place them in a closed box or a bowl-like trap, from which it will be difficult for them to find a way out. Far from breathing an air of confidence, the practice of writing on the bowls suggests a certain angst.Can we draw any conclusions from the restricted sample of texts quoted concerning the mode of transmission of magical formulae? Our examples cannot decide the issue between oral or written trans-mission. There can hardly be a doubt to my mind that both forms of transmission played a role in the communication of incantations. When we think of the bowl scribes, we are dealing with a literate group of people. There are differences as regards their level of proficiency. Some bowls are written in a good scribal hand such as is known from manuscripts of Late Antiquity and the Medieval period, others display"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" transmission and transformation of spells 205a crude hand, often with many spelling errors. This external difference usually goes together with the contrast regarding the textual quality of the incantations. Certain prolific scribes have a hand that is easy to recognize and remember. Mahdukh daughter of Newandukh, owner of Bowls I–III, must have paid particular attention to the quality of the scribes she employed. Their texts tend to be rich in vocabulary and to consist of elaborate phraseology.It is quite possible that the scribes quoted at times from memory. Several errors in Aramaic and Hebrew can best be explained as mis-takes of oral transmission.37 In other cases the errors can be diag-nosed as copying mistakes. Were the written prototypes from which some texts were copied available in the form of books, or were they chiefly extant on bowls? This is a question to which no clear answer can be given at this stage. In the period when the bowls were pro-duced, between the fourth and seventh centuries CE, there existed in the Jewish world books of magical instruction with formulae of magic texts, and some of them have survived. None of these books was com-posed in Babylonia, but the sections in the Babylonian Talmud dealing with spells may suggest the possible existence of magic handbooks.38 It may be assumed that bowls previously inscribed were easily acces-sible as a source of texts. Practitioners acquired their knowledge and skill no doubt by being apprentices to well established masters. They may have written down spells as an aide-memoire, and may have kept notebooks of spells, in whatever form. This practice is known from the Geniza collections, where, besides structured books of magic, we also have private notations of magic texts.39 Paper was not yet available in the period of the bowls, nor was papyrus a real option in Babylonia, so leather, pottery and possibly metal seem to have been the major 37 See in particular the recent works of Matthew Morgenstern, especially 2007. Cf. also an example such as the spelling of wayyehi binsoaʿ ha-aron etc., Num. 10:35, in Naveh and Shaked 1985, B3:5, where the Hebrew words are given in the following bizarre form: wḥyḥy byn nswʿ hʾrwn wymr mwšh qwmʾ yhwh wypwṣw ʾybʾk wynsw m[vacat] mypnk, a spelling that surely betrays poor knowledge of the way Hebrew is written.38 Two recent surveys of this literature may be mentioned: Bohak 2008:351ff.; Harari 2010:272ff.39 An example for such a notebook, with texts for different purposes in Judeo- Arabic and in Hebrew-Aramaic, is JTSL ENA 2871.7–8, published in Schäfer and Shaked 1997:126–131 (text 28). I should like to correct on this occasion two points in the lat-ter publication. On p. 130, line 8b:1, read: “Wenn du einen Mann vor seiner Frau (ʿan ahlihi) binden willst”; read in line 8b:5: “bis zu der Zeit, die wir wünschen.”"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"206  shaul  shakedalternatives. Leather may have been too expensive, and besides, it is a perishable material; metal sheets, though commonly available and long-lasting, have left no traces among the archaeological finds of incantations from Babylonia.The language of the incantations shows many instances of archaic Aramaic, in some cases used artificially and inconsistently, revealing to us that they must have been quite far removed from the current Aramaic used in speech and writing. The authors of the texts tried to reproduce what seemed to them a higher and more prestigious lan-guage, perhaps influenced by the Targum or other learned texts. That it was an artificial language emerges from a series of hypercorrections and from their inconsistency in the use of certain forms.40Despite the chaotic appearance of the texts quoted, we may come to the conclusion that there are rules that govern the confusion, and that these rules are followed by the writers of bowls. The texts, as we have seen, are on the whole quite faithfully and consistently transmit-ted, but there is a range of toleration for certain additions before and after the main text (and sometimes inside it), and for combining two or three spells in one incantation.The consistent wording of the spells in different bowls may teach us something about the way incantations were composed and spells transmitted. The transmission of the magical texts is not much dif-40 This emerges, for example, from an examination of the spelling deviations detected by Morgenstern (2007). Among our three bowls, it may be noted, Bowl 2 stands out as presenting a number of peculiarities. Cf. the spellings hwynʾ, ʾytylydnʾ (Bowl 1:7, Bowl 3:7) with hwynʾh, ʾytylydnʾh (Bowl 2:5–6); mmryq, mmrqn (Bowl 1:7; Bowl 3:8) with mʾmryq, mʾmrqn (Bowl 2:7). Bowl 2:9 has bḥtmʾh, bytltʾh, spellings which look like instances of hypercorrection; Bowls 1 and 3 do not have anything similar. Ch. Müller-Kessler, in a series of articles, has adopted the term ‘Standard Literary Babylonian Aramaic’ to designate the language of most bowls in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. It is not clear whether she wishes to imply that this form of language was standard for members of all religious groups in Sasanian Babylonia. If this is the claim, one could argue that Christians, Manichaeans and pagans probably used Syriac as their vehicle of literary communication, and that Mandaeans employed the Mandaic language and script. For all we know, the square Hebrew script was used for Aramaic exclusively by Jews, and this is corroborated by the fact that most bowls in this script contain peculiar Jewish elements, such as quotations from the Hebrew Bible and the Jewish prayer book as well as midrashic allusions (cf. also the remarks in the same direction by Harviainen 1995, esp. note 1). The Aramaic used in these bowls shows in general signs of a high literary and archaic language. The important affinities of phrases and expressions between Mandaic and the JBA incantations, which Müller-Kessler has discovered (e.g. in Müller-Kessler 1999/2000; also Greenfield and Naveh 1985) show that certain Mandaic themes were borrowed from Mandaean formulae, but they do not prove, to my mind, that Mandaic is the source of all the common themes."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" transmission and transformation of spells 207ferent from the way liturgical texts have been transmitted in Juda-ism, relying on repetition and memory, before they were codified in a prayer-book form.It is impossible to ignore the literary quality of many of the spells. This is eminently noticeable in the formula “I descended to the depths of the earth”, with its high language, its peculiar poetic structure, and its double-edged vision, downwards and upwards. There is also a marked tendency to high drama, conveyed by the spatial movement of the narrator, by the visions seen, and by the dialogue. A similar observation can be made on the highly structured and complex spell “the Great Primordial Father”. One can’t help feeling that the demons had a highly developed sensitivity to poetic figures of speech, which acted upon them, we might say, like magic. They had no choice but to flee or be subdued.Appendix: The Aramaic Texts1.

It is this sub-group of five texts that will be the focus of this paper. We shall see what we can learn about this group of bowls in terms of: purpose, praxis, physical form and structure of formulae. Through a comparison with other groups of bowls from Berlin and London I hope also to map some of the traditions found within them and trace evidence for trails of transmission.The most obvious connection between all the bowls in this group of five from Berlin is the fact that all define themselves as being a qyblʾ (קיבלא)—in this particular group of texts meaning that they are a kind of counter-charm. Thus they are all intended to return adverse magical actions to their origin—in these cases identified specifically as individuals who are personally named. As such, these spells have an aggressive tone in that they clearly intend harm to be wreaked upon humans they identify by name who are perceived by the clients as adversaries—whom I shall refer to, in general, as “the antagonists.” A question which I will not go into in this chapter is whether we consider these “counter-charm” bowl texts as curses—since they constitute an attack on human individuals—or whether we still perceive them as 1 I would like to dedicate this chapter to Professor Shaul Shaked who is always an inspiring and patient teacher.2 I would like to thank Dr Joachim Marzahn, the curator of the collection, who has been most helpful over the years.3 The title of the forthcoming volume is “May These Curses Flee”; Jewish Aramaic Curse Texts from Mesopotamia in Late Antiquity."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"220  dan  leveneapotropaic—as they define their raison d’être as being the aversion of an attack and a returning of it to its culpable human origin.The bowlsThe five Berlin qyblʾ bowls are:VA 2423 and VA 2416• 4 which are written by the same hand for the same client and against the same antagonist,VA 2434 and VA 2424 are also a pair that are written by one scribe • for the same client and against the same antagonist, andVA 2484 which, like the other 4, describes itself as a • qyblʾ and speci-fies the names of the client as well as the antagonist; for this last bowl there is none to make it a pair as with the others though, as we shall see, the evidence suggests there was originally an accom-panying bowl.Another group of bowls that describe themselves as qyblʾ bowls, and therefore relevant to this study, are three from the British Museum (BM): 039A, 040A and 041A.5 039A and 041A share the names of both client and antagonist. 040A shares with these two only the name of the antagonist. Though I am not entirely certain, it seems to me that these three bowls were written by the same scribe.In the table below is a synopsis of the opening formulae of the Ber-lin bowls. VA 2423 and VA 2416 are one of the pairs and are therefore beside each other. As can be seen in the table, VA 2416 has a repetition of the opening formula which is also presented in this synopsis. The beginning of the text of the partner of VA 2434—i.e., VA 2424—has faded, hence its absence from the table. It is, however, clear from the rest of the text visible on VA 2424 that this text is very close in content to VA 2434 in which most of its text is present, despite the fact that it is in a slightly different order. It is, therefore, possible that its begin-ning might have included a variation of the same formula.4 Published by Wohlstein (1893), pp. 11–27, late in the 19th century and re-edited by myself.5 Segal (2000), pp. 79–85."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" ‘this is a qyblʾ for overturning sorceries’ 221Berlin bowlsVA 2423VA 2416VA 2434VA 2484a קיבלא הדיןחרשי לבטולי ולוטתאונידרא ואכמראתא קיבלא הדיןלמיפךחרשיולוטתא ונידרי ושיקופתא ואשלמתאואכמרתא קיבלא הדיןלמיפך בישתא ירור(17) אני בישמךעושה קיבלא הדיןלמיפךבישתא ירור אני לישמךעושההדיןלמיפך ולשדוריולאכמורירחק(א)ו ירור. . .

This variance in detail of duplicate formulae is typical of the magic bowl text as a genre and suggests it to have been a feature of its literary tradition. Note also that although this is a type of curse formula, in that it is definitely intended to the detri-ment of another human, it also presents itself as being ultimately a protective measure. The supernatural entity that is attacking the client is described as having been conjured up by a human foe to whom it is promptly returned.The three BM bowls mentioned above start with variants of the same formulae that are found in the five VA bowls.

Indeed, our group of texts are all charms that state their purpose to be the countering of the aggressive magic conjured up against the clients they were writ-ten for and meant to protect. One must, however, note that in the Babylonian Talmud this word is attested in the plainer sense of just “charm”;7 not specifically warranting the expanded sense of “counter-charm.” It is, nevertheless, clear from our bowls that this expanded 6 Drower and Macuch (1963), p. 405b.7 Sokoloff (2002), p. 1009b, bBer 62a."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"224  dan  levenesense be considered, at the very least, as included in the meaning of the term. For even the simple sense of “charm”—to ward off harm-ful magical forces—is not exclusive of the fact that they might well have had their origin with a human agent. Jastrow provides the gloss “[a means against,] charm (to ward of danger)”8 that fits the case of the particular bowl texts mentioned above rather well. In the nominal form קבילתא it has the meaning of “complaint,”9 which in Syriac has the more forceful sense of “accusation” or “rebuke.”10 These meanings fit well the legalistic sense and force that often underpins the tone of the magic bowl incantation texts. Indeed, the Akkadian cognates based on the root qbl: qabalu(m) II meaning “battle”11 and qubbulu “to fight,”12 also incorporate the aggressive tone that we note in the Aramaic qyblʾ of our bowls.Other meanings derived from the root קבל that are worth not-ing are “darkness,”13 “to become dark”14 and the preposition לקבל—“junction,” “meeting”15 and “opposite.”16 These meanings bring to mind two things that, as we shall presently see, prove to be signifi-cant. The first is the fact that all but one of the bowls (040A) with the qyblʾ formula under discussion have bitumen markings17 on them; the second is a comment made by Hilprecht regarding the excavation of magic bowls that: “Sometimes two bowls facing one another had been cemented together with bitumen.”18 If our qyblʾ bowls with bitumen markings constitute such pairs—i.e. pairs of bowls that were custom made to be set rim to rim opposite each other to be fixed with bitu-men and interred as a unit—then we may consider qyblʾ’s other mean-ings of “darkness,” “junction,” “meeting” and “opposite,” that are such apt descriptions of such a physical configuration, to bear relevance 8 Jastrow (1903), p. 1309b. 9 Sokoloff (2002), p. 978b.10 Brockelmann (1966), p. 641b—¿ܳÿàÙܺÂø accusatio—rebuke, “charge, accusation,” and Sokoloff (2009), p. 1310, “accusation, complaint.”(Payne Smith [1903], p. 487a).

Thus the word qyblʾ would be used in this context as a pun referring to both the purpose of the amulet—a “charm,” “counter-charm”—and to its physical form—two bowls that are “opposite” each other, their rims “meeting” at a “junction” and the space between them in “darkness.” Indeed, the bitumen markings on the verso of VA 2484, as can be seen in figure 1, reveal that this bowl was once lashed to another that is now missing. The two bowls were bound together with some sort of cord wrapped twice around the two bowls, forming a cross shape when viewed from above. This cord was fastened to the bowls in six places with globules of bitumen—upon the four points where the cord traversed the joined rims of the two bowls and at the apex of each of them where the cord crossed itself. Thus the pair of bowls that were a qyblʾ in purpose—“charm” or “counter-charm”—were also a qyblʾ in the physical sense—being “opposite” each other, their rims “meeting” and a “darkness” formed between them.An examination of the two pairs of qyblʾ bowls from Berlin yielded the following: VA 2434 and VA 2424 is one of the pairs of qyblʾ texts that were each written by the same scribe for the same client against the same antagonist. As can be seen in figure 2 below, when this pair of bowls were placed together, rim to rim, the bitumen markings matched up, verifying that these two bowls were lashed and bitumened to each other in the same way as we saw above was true regarding VA 2484. They both have the qyblʾ formula and together they constitute a qyblʾ form.Figure 1.

Placed opposite each other, they too reveal the bitumen markings on their rims that match up. The only difference with this pair, in regard to the previous two examples, was that the markings on the extremities of the bowls suggest that the cord was wrapped around them more than twice.

They also have bitumen markings on the rims but not on the apex of the verso as with the Berlin bowls. These bowls did not seem to match up very neatly when placed rim to rim. If not a pair in themselves, they most surely had each been parts of separate pairs. 040A, on the other hand, has no signs of bitumen, suggesting that either it was not bitumened to another bowl or that if bitumen had been there it had fallen off, the markings having faded or been removed in some way.So far it can be observed that within this group of bowls there is a cor-relation between the type of formula, the qyblʾ formula, and the physical arrangement of these bowls in that they were made in pairs that were set together, rim to rim, lashed with a cord in some cases and bitumened together prior to interment. It can now be stated that the Berlin and BM bowls discussed above constitute the material remains of at least five pairs of joined bowls: 1) VA 2484 and ?, 2) VA 2434 and VA 2424, 3) VA 2423 and VA 2416, 4) 039A and ?, and 5) 041A and ?.Other aspects of the formulae that appear in this group of qyblʾ texts (duplicate section “a”)We have seen that both the Berlin and BM qyblʾ bowls share an open-ing formula—a formula that, despite variations, is present in all of the texts where the opening formula is visible.

In its various mani-festations in the rabbinic literature it occurs either as ירור or ירוד, the final letter interchanging between ר and ד. This seems to have already caused problems of interpretation in the Middle Ages.24 There is, how-ever, the Syriac term ÀܳܘܪܽûܳØ that means “jackal.” Understandings of this term have been arrived at also on the basis of the versions where yrwr appears as a translation of the Hebrew תנים “jackals”25 and יענה בנות “ostriches.”26 Besides our texts there is the one case where this term is associated with the demonic world—in the Syro-Hexapla to Is 34:14 the translation of לילית is ûØܘܪÀ.27 Montgomery adds a note to the meaning of ירור, that “the root is onomatopoeic, connoting a howling creature.”28 He then suggests that choosing this word to represent the demon is based on the fact that the “Babylonians represented their demons in uncouth shapes of birds and animals.” Hunter also dis-cussed this word in reference to Micha 1:8 and a section from the Acta of St. Simeon Stylites, where the cry of the jackal is likened to the cry of mourners.29 It is quite astonishing considering the nature of this term in our texts, and it might only be a coincidence, that in Akkadian we find the term arāru “curse,”30 and its Hebrew cognate רַאָר that has the same meaning.31One of the Berlin texts, VA 2484, tells a chilling tale of what the yaror can do:24 Nathan ben Jehiel et al., vol. 4, pp. 159–60.

This could not be said of the hpykh texts—04A and its parallels—most of which do not show evidence of joining and sealing with bitu-men. However, the fact that 04A, a hpykh text—also a counter-charm by definition—was lashed and sealed with bitumen suggests the pos-sibility that this, the physical aspect of praxis, was adopted from its initial use in the qyblʾ type.I would argue the possibility that the qyblʾ form has a special rela-tion to the qyblʾ formula. It might be that the form originated from its use with the formula. However, the qyblʾ form and formula might have evolved independently, yet became more closely associated in praxis as the punning connection between the form and formula implied in the word qyblʾ was realized and exploited. If, however, it could be proved that the former is the case—i.e., the qyblʾ form was conceived as part of the function of the qyblʾ formula—then the trail of transmission of joining bowls and sealing with bitumen could be traced from its use with the qyblʾ formula to use in conjunction with the hpykh formula and beyond.ReferencesBlack, Jeremy A., A.

Therefore, an analysis of the complex history of astral magic in ancient Jewish discourses has to begin with a brief overview of previous research. Many nineteenth- and twentieth-century historians, who made astrology the main focus of their studies, seemed to feel the need for justifying what they did. Auguste Bouché-Leclercq (1842–1924), for instance, opens his celebrated study on L’astrologie grecque (1899), with the witty remark that it is perhaps not a simple waste of time to study things with which other people have wasted their time. At the end of the nineteenth century, it was a widespread belief that Euro-pean post-Enlightenment modernity had left astrological “superstition” behind for good, and that this discipline could now only be studied as a curiosity. This changed only with Aby Warburg (1866–1929), whose legendary lecture in 1912 on the cycle of frescos in the Palazzo Schifanoia and its astrological iconography suddenly moved astrology into the center of academic scrutiny. With his study Heidnisch-antike Weissagung in Wort und Bild zu Luthers Zeit (1920, Engl. as The Renewal of Pagan Antiquity: Contributions to the Cultural History of the European Renaissance), Warburg—and subsequently many scho-lars of the Warburg School—paid attention to the important role of astrology in the Renaissance, which he read as a conscious revival of ancient paganism.Research into ancient astrology witnessed similar progress. Franz Cumont (1868–1947) and Franz Boll (1867–1923) collected and edited an incredible amount of astrological manuscripts and fragments from the ancient Greek world in the Corpus codicum astrologorum Graecorum."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"246 kocku von stuckradWilhelm Gundel and his son Hans Georg published many studies about ancient astrology. Finally, Lynn Thorndike has to be mentioned, whose encyclopedic History of Magic and Experimental Science (1923–1958) covers no less than seventeen centuries. Thorndike and the other historians thus made accessible a cornucopia of primary sources that had previously been unknown or had not been taken seriously. At the same time, many historians of science (including Thorndike) had difficulties in interpreting astrological sources in a neutral way. Small wonder, then, that George Sarton dismissed these sources in 1951 as “superstitious flotsam of the Near East.” Despite the famous reply by Otto Neugebauer (1889–1990), published under the title “The Study of Wretched Subjects” in the scholarly journal Isis, and Neugebauer’s insistence on the importance of astrology for our understanding of the history of the natural sciences, this area of scholarly research has something sleazy about it still today.The reluctance of modern historians to analyze astrology as an important element of European cultural history—as well as the at times bitter and polemical fights between natural scientists and astro-logers about the legitimacy of astrology—reveal one thing: at stake here are not only historical facts but also identities. Pushing astrology to the margins of natural science, rationality or the Christian religion confirms modern identities that like to see “the West” as enlightened, rational and immune to the “pagan past.”1Standing on the shoulders of the academic giants mentioned above, recent scholarship has tried to free itself from biased assumptions about astrology being merely a discipline of “pseudo-science” or “superstition.”2 Today, only few scholars would doubt that in Late Antiquity astrology held a key position among the accepted and well-reputed sciences. As ars mathematica closely connected with astronomy, it made its way into the highest political and philosophical orders of the Roman Empire3 and became the standard model for interpreting past, present and future events. Nevertheless, many scholars assume that the appli-cation of astrological theories is limited to the “pagan mind,” whereas Jewish and Christian theology is characterized by a harsh refutation of astrology’s implications. Unfortunately, this assumption is not the 1 On this mechanism, see also Zika (2003).2 See, for instance, Barton (1995); Oestmann et al.

This evidence has either been played down—if not neglected entirely—or labeled “heretic,” thus prolonging the polemics of the “church fathers” right into modernity. One gains the impression that Jews and Christians simply did not take notice of what was going on around them. David Flusser plainly notes: “The Jewish people in Palestine and elsewhere had become completely immune to the attractions of the paganism against which the prophets [had spoken].”4 And Gundel resumes regarding the Christians: “Right from the beginning Christianity refuted astrology’s axioms and radi-cally fought against them.”5 Considering the huge amount of Jewish and Christian astrological documents in Late Antiquity, these state-ments are, at least, questionable.6These often undoubted academic axioms have had negative impli-cations for the study of ancient astrology and magic. First of all, docu-ments not fitting into the narrow perspective of modern scholarship have simply been ignored. The fact that it took 35 years from the pre-liminary publication of the Qumran horoscope 4Q186 by J. T. Milik in 1957 and its new presentation to a wider public by R. Eisenman and M. Wise in 1992 is a telling example. But in some cases the astrological connotations were too strong to be ignored entirely, e.g. the pavements of the Palestinian synagogues with their zodiacal depiction7 or—on the Christian side—the elaborated astrological ingredients within gnostic writings. In these cases scholars tend to claim that those developments were only able to emerge outside “orthodox” or “normative” Judaism and Christianity. With regard to astrology the same process of centra-lization has taken place as in the case of Christian mythmaking, pro-foundly analyzed by Burton L. Mack.8 Jonathan Z. Smith laid further emphasis on the methodological difficulties still determinable within theological historiography:4 Quoted from Charlesworth (1987), p. 945 note 65.5 Gundel (1966), p. 332 (if not noted otherwise, all translations are mine).6 For a detailed description of ancient Jewish astrology, see von Stuckrad (2000b); for the present article, I have used material from that study, as well as passages pub-lished in von Stuckrad (2000a).7 On which see von Stuckrad (1996), pp. 161–175.8 Mack (1995), see especially pp. 7–11."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"248 kocku von stuckradAs in the archaic locative ideology, the centre has been protected, the periphery seen as threatening, and relative difference perceived as abso-lute ‘other.’ The centre, the fabled Pauline seizure by the ‘Christ-event’ or some other construction of an originary moment, has been declared, a priori, to be unique, to be sui generis, and hence, by definition, incom-parable. The periphery, whether understood temporally to precede or follow the Pauline moment, or, in spatial terms, to surround it, is to be subjected to procedures of therapeutic comparison. This is exorcism or purgation, not scholarship.9The modulations of this criticism have been intensively discussed in the humanities during the last three decades,10 but its implications have only rarely been put into practice. In other words: although that criticism is widely accepted theoretically, many scholars shrink from the consequences that lead to a new position regarding the possibility of telling a monolinear history. But one has to take them seriously. General definitions of “Judaism,” “Christianity” or “astrology” should be avoided.11 They are the result of a theological project of legitimiza-tion carried out in ancient and early modern times. Acknowledging the multiplicity of astro-magical perspectives in ancient culture means that we will no longer try to “detect” a linear development from refu-tation to adoption, from superstition to enlightenment, or vice versa. Those “developments” are mere inventions of scholarly emplotment.12 What we will have to take seriously is the fact that the ancient authors were involved in a twofold discourse—first, in their religion’s tradi-tion, and, second, in their contemporary social, political, scientific and religious negotiations. Hence, the analysis has to keep in mind the possible overlapping of different discourses, regardless of religions’ boundaries.Addressing discourses instead of distinct religious traditions is a strategic response to the fact that the very terms “Jewish” and “Chris-tian” are contested categories. As to Judaism, Shaye J. D. Cohen argued in a much discussed monograph that until the third and fourth cen-turies the category “Jewish” did not have the same importance and 9 Smith (1990), p. 143.10 Among the most illuminating contributions to this debate are Berger & Luck-mann (1966); White (1973); White (1978); Koselleck (1995); Müller and Rüsen (1997). Cf. von Stuckrad (2000b), pp. 12–101; von Stuckrad (2003).11 See von Stuckrad (2002).12 Hayden White introduced this expression and distinguished it from argument and ideological implication. All three are standard means to give a pretence of explana-tion to an academic treatise; see White (1973)."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" astral magic in ancient jewish discourse 249connotation that modern interpreters found in terms as Ioudaios/Iudaeus or ioudaizein. Cohen argues:[M]y thesis is that Jewish identity in antiquity was elusive and uncertain for two simple reasons. First, there was no single or simple definition of Jew in antiquity. Indeed, the Greek word Ioudaios, usually translated as “Jew,” often is better translated as “Judaean,” and the concepts “Jew” and “Judaean,” in turn, need clarification. Second, there were few mecha-nisms in antiquity that would have provided empirical or “objective” criteria by which to determine who was “really” a Jew and who was not. Jewishness was a subjective identity, constructed by the individual him/herself, other Jews, other gentiles, and the state.13If we regard ancient religions as a dynamic plurality of identities with various subjective meanings and if we acknowledge the fact that peo-ple could be followers of theologically quite different religious tradi-tions, we will perhaps gain a better understanding of the processes of group formation and theological competition in Late Antiquity. As Andreas Bendlin argues, for Republican Rome the “hybridity” of reli-gious convictions was by no means an exception. “Religious hybrids [. . .] resulted from the instrumentalisation of the public domain by private concerns; students of Roman religion shun them as marginal to their systematizations, yet hybrids such as these may in fact have been the rule in the polytheistic society of late republican Rome.”14But if the terms “religion” or “tradition”15 in general, and “Judaism,” “Christianity” or “paganism” in particular, are hybrid, fleeting and dynamic categories, we will have to find other categories for adequa-tely describing religious processes in Late Antiquity. This is why I use the term of fields of discourse, a concept that takes the transgression of religious traditions as the normal case, subsequently identifying sha-red fields of interest as well as arenas of conflict. Talking of discour-ses also acknowledges the insight that European history of religion is characterized by a two-fold pluralism—i.e., a transfer between reli-gious traditions on the one hand, and an interference between various cultural systems, such as religion, philosophy, politics, law, art, eco-nomy, etc.—on the other.1613 Cohen (1999), p. 3.14 Bendlin (2000), p. 132. Methodologically, this is a problem of singularization that affected both theology and—subsequently—the study of religion. On the concept of “singularization,” see Gladigow (2006) and Smith (2004).15 For a problematization of the concept of “tradition” that is ultimately a polemical term for constructions of conflicting identities, see von Stuckrad (2005).16 See Kippenberg, Rüpke and von Stuckrad (2009); von Stuckrad (2010, pp. 3–23)."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"250 kocku von stuckradThis approach can easily be combined with Peter Schäfer’s notion of macroforms, which he introduced to describe the textual structures that underlie the Hekhalot literature. According to Schäfer, macro-forms are (ideal ) literary units that materialize in a large number of concrete microforms—i.e., texts.17 If we extend the concept of macro-forms to the magical and astrological texts of Late Antiquity, we will encounter many structural elements that are shared by representatives of different religious convictions; macroforms are a way to identify fields of discourse. When it comes to the concrete manifestation of such shared fields of discourse—the microforms—the transformation, adaptation and polemical differentiation in a pluralistic religious envi-ronment become visible.The methodological considerations concerning the status of astro-logy in ancient culture pertain to the field of magic, as well. However, this is not the place to analyze the controversial term “magic” in detail. The basic problem boils down to the question whether we apply the use of “magic” as it is attested widely—and controversially—in ancient documents, or an academic use of the term. The latter is fraught with difficulties and preconceived attitudes that have a history of their own.18 My suggestion is that we as scholars should adopt a meta-position and analyze the various uses of the term in historical context (what I call a “magical field of discourse”). Despite these precautions, my use of the term in this article also reflects my understanding that it is analytically meaningful to call something “magic” that (a) involves a cosmological model that reckons with an intrinsic connection between various layers of reality, and (b) a ritual practice that intends to work with these relationships. Hence, the doctrine of correspondences is a 17 “I employ the term macroform for a superimposed literary unit, instead of the terms writing or work, to accommodate the fluctuating character of the texts of the Hekhalot literature. The term macroform concretely denotes both the fictional or imaginary single text, which we initially and by way of delimitation always refer to in scholarly literature (e.g., Hekhalot Rabbati in contrast to Ma‘aseh Merkavah, etc.), as well as the often different manifestations of this text in the various manuscripts. The border between micro- and macroforms is thereby fluent: certain definable textual units can be both part of a superimposed entirety (and thus a ‘microform’) as well as an independently transmitted redactional unit (thus a ‘macroform’)” (Schäfer 1992, p. 6 note 14).18 See Styers (2004); e.g. the polemical distinction between “magic” and “religion” or between “compulsion” and “prayer.”"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" astral magic in ancient jewish discourse 251common feature both of astrology19 and of magic; we can even argue that many forms of magic or ritual power are based on techniques of “applied correspondences.”During Greco-Roman times magic was a common religious activity and worldview. Recent studies in ancient magic reveal the fact that this kind of “ritual power” flourished among Jews and Christians as well.20 Just as with astrology, there is no reason to sever magic from pious Jewish or Christian faith, as theological historiography used to do.21 Nor is it appropriate to consider magic as being the religion for daily life purposes of less educated people. The complex rituals performed in the so-called Mithras Liturgy, the Sepher ha-Razīm, or some gnos-tic documents demanded a high standard of education, not to men-tion the philosophical skills of an Apuleius.22 The differences between sophisticated magical theory and practice, on the one hand, and the more pragmatic application for medical and daily life reasons, on the other, still await thorough scholarly research.23Astral Magic in Ancient Jewish DiscourseIn what follows, my objective is to identify three major fields of ancient magical discourse that make use of astrological semantics. All of them—the control of cosmic powers, the veneration of planets, 19 In Late Antiquity there was a broad consensus that the heavenly realms mirror—in a secret or obvious way—mundane events. This notion was so common that it is diffi-cult to find a document which does not make use of it. It is visible in the stoic concept of sympathy and heimarmenē, as well as in the Platonists’ description of the world as a living creature with every part connected to other parts or to its transcendent idea. In Roman Egypt, Platonism was molded with older priestly traditions and brought forth the esoteric doctrines of the Corpus Hermeticum. Despite the various roots of Hermetic doctrines and practices, the Egyptian matrix of Hermeticism that originated in Ptolemaic times cannot be doubted. On this point I agree with Cumont (1937) and Lindsay (1971). See also Mahé (1978–1982); Fowden (1986); Burns (2004).20 The literature is abundant. The change of paradigm concerning our understanding of magic can be studied in Naveh and Shaked (1987); Faraone and Obbink (1991); Gager (1992); Meyer and Mirecki (1995); Graf (1996); Schäfer and Kippenberg (1997); Bremmer and Veenstra (2002); Mirecki and Meyer (2002); Shaked (2005).21 In fact, magic and demonology formed an integral part of early Christian theol-ogy, which perpetuated magic in a mode of condemnation; see Flint (1999). 22 See Sandy (1997).23 It seems that the former is represented by theurgic groups, philosophers and others, the latter by the authors of PGM, magic bowls and similar documents. But this distinction is far from being accurate. For the theurgic groups cf., for instance, Johnston (1997). On Neoplatonic theurgy, see Shaw (1995)."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"252 kocku von stuckradand the heavenly journeys of religious specialists—reveal strategies of adopting, transforming and polemically differentiating magical theory and practice in the first centuries CE.Controlling the Cosmic PowersStarting with the discursive field of control of heavenly powers, the first macroform to be identified is the textual tradition that was shaped around the figure of Solomon, with the Testament of Solomon being its most important representative.24 The text’s title makes sufficiently clear what the reader can expect: Testament of Solomon, son of David, who reigned in Jerusalem, and subdued all the spirits of the air, of the earth, and under the earth; through (them) he also accomplished all the magnificent works of the Temple;25 (this tells) what their authorities are against men, and by what angels these demons are thwarted.26To unfold his magic power, Solomon, after having prayed to God, receives his famous seal ring27 from the archangel Michael. With the help of his magic ring Solomon is able to find out the names of the demonic powers and, subsequently, to thwart them.28 Of astrologi-cal interest is the fact that Solomon forces the entities to tell him the zodiacal place they inhabit. For example:(2:1) When I heard these things, I, Solomon, got up from my throne and saw the demon shuddering and trembling with fear. I said to him, “Who are you? What is your name?” The demon replied, “I am called Ornias.” (2) I said to him, “Tell me, in which sign of the zodiac do you reside?” The demon replied, “In Aquarius; I strangle those who reside in Aquarius because of their passion for women whose zodiacal sign is Virgo [. . .].”24 On Solomon as an esoteric authority in Antiquity, see Torijano (2002). On tex-tual criticism and the astrological doctrines involved in the Testament of Solomon, see von Stuckrad (2000b), pp. 394–420. Johnston (2002) gives a brief overview of the Testament’s status and reception.25 Sarah I. Johnston notes: “This, so far as I have been able to discover, is the first example of demons being so used from any Mediterranean culture” (2002, p. 42).26 I follow D. C. Duling’s translation in Charlesworth (1983–1985), vol. 2, pp. 935–987, who in most cases relies on McCowns’ translation of 1922.27 Cf. PGM V.213–303; VII.628–42; XII.201–305; Sepher ha-Razīm 6:16–29. There is much more evidence in antiquity for making rings in order to exorcise or control demons; see references in Preisendanz (1956); Johnston (2002), p. 36 note 4; on ring spells see also Dieleman (2005), pp. 182–183.28 Very often, the magical act rests on the knowledge of the ‘secret names.’"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" astral magic in ancient jewish discourse 253The zodiacal astrology, combined here with demonological perspecti-ves, is further attested by the seven constellations that appear through the power of Solomon’s evocation:(8:1) There came seven spirits bound up together hand and foot, fair of form and graceful. When I, Solomon, saw them, I was amazed and asked them, “Who are you?” (2) They replied, “We are heavenly bodies [esmen stoicheia], rulers of this world of darkness [kosmokratores tou skotous].” (3) The first said, “I am Deception.” The second said, “I am Strife.” The third said, “I am Fate.” The fourth said, “I am Distress.” The fifth said, “I am Error.” The sixth said, “I am Power.” (4) The seventh said, “I am The Worst. Our stars in heaven look small, but we are named like gods. We change our position together and we live together, sometimes in Lydia, sometimes in Olympus, sometimes on the great mountain.”The seven stoicheia—heavenly bodies, planets, or just evil entities—belong to the most prominent actors of Jewish and Christian theo-logy in Late Antiquity. They were known to Paul who reminded his audience that “we have not to fight against humans of flesh and blood but against the rulers and powers, the sovereigns of this dark world (pros tous kosmokratores tou skotous toutou), against the evil beings of the heavenly realm.”29 At this point, Paul adopts the same attitude as his gnostic fellow-Christians at Nag Hammadi:Then since Death was androgynous, he mixed with his nature and begot seven androgynous sons. These are the names of the males: Jealousy, Wrath, Weeping, Sighing, Mourning, Lamenting, Tearful Groaning. And these are the names of the females: Wrath, Grief, Lust, Sighing, Cursing, Bitterness, Quarrelsomeness. They had intercourse with one another, and each one begot seven so that they total forty-nine andro-gynous demons. Their names and their functions you will find in “the Book of Solomon.”30This is the only passage in the Nag Hammadi corpus that explicitly refers to a “Book of Solomon.”31 We cannot be sure whether this refe-rence is to our Testament of Solomon; Doresse argued for the Letter to Rehobeam, which is also known as the Hygromancy of Solomon or the Key to Hygromancy, and which probably originates in first-century BC 29 Eph. 6:12; cf. also Col. 2:4.20; Gal. 4:3.9.30 On the Origin of the World (NHC II.5 and XIII.2), trans. Bethge and Wintermute, in: Robinson (1988), p. 167.31 Solomon’s name, however, is mentioned in three other texts; see Duling in Charlesworth (1983–1985), p. 942."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"254 kocku von stuckradEgypt.32 In that book, there are lists of the seven planets, angels, and demons, rendering their influence on the 24 hours of the day during one week, accompanied by prayers to the planets and angels, magical symbols of planets, and the correspondences between planets, zodia-cal signs and plants. Despite this clear similarity, Doresse argues that the reference of the Nag Hammadi treatise is “to something in that vast collection entitled the Testament of Solomon, which enumerates a crowd of genies and mentions, for example, as rulers of this ter-restrial world, Deception, Discord, Quarrelsomeness, Violent Agita-tion, Error, Violence and Perversity.”33 In any case, the mention of Solomon’s astro-magical powers and a remarkable similarity in texts originating from Hellenistic Egyptian,34 Jewish and Christian contexts, indicate the existence of a macroform of these texts that was extremely popular in those days.The stoicheia topic is widespread among ancient theologies. And equally acknowledged was the ontological subordination and subjuga-tion of the celestial powers, forced under Solomon’s will who himself received his power from the almighty God. The intention is clear: The stars are under God’s control and human beings are capable of invo-king them in order to do pious work. Each adept, knowing the demons’ secret names and performing Solomon’s instructions, can accurately take part in the power—the magician actually becomes Solomon. The transformation of older Egyptian theological doctrines in monotheis-tic contexts is apparent in the Testament of Solomon. Already in 1936, 32 Edited by J. Heeg in CCAG VIII, 2 (1911), pp. 139–165. Cf. Reitzenstein (1904), pp. 186–187, who lists parallels in Josephus, Kore Kosmou, and the Testament of Solo-mon; Festugière (1950–1954), I, pp. 339–340; Goodenough (1953–1968), II, p. 233; Preisendanz (1956), pp. 690ff. (with further texts on hygromancy—i.e., the attempt to thwart demons in liquids to gain revelation from them). The Letter to Rehobeam with its prayers to the stars serves Ness as an explanation of the zodiacs in ancient syna-gogue pavements, because the planetary angels are representatives of God himself, “maintaining the world He created” (Ness 1990, p. 217).33 Doresse (1986), p. 170.34 The strong Egyptian influences are studied in detail by Dieleman (2005). With reference to PGM IV.850–929, which deals with a communication with Osiris by means of an ecstatic seizure of an adult or boy medium, he states that, “given the purely Egyptian character of these ritual techniques and mythological references, the attribution to the Jewish king Solomon is rather remarkable. However, the occurrence of Solomon’s name in a magical text of the Roman period is not unusual, since, among Hellenised Jewish circles in Alexandria of the second century BCE onwards, the Bibli-cal figure Solomon had been transformed from a wise king to a powerful astrologer and magician who exerted control over a wide range of demons” (p. 279, with refer-ence to Torijano 2002, pp. 225–230)."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" astral magic in ancient jewish discourse 255W. Gundel had argued for a strong influence of Egyptian decan tra-dition on the Jewish Testament.35 In the wake of a monotheistic adap-tation, the ontological status of the planetary powers changed, an impression that is further attested if we look at the decan melothesy—i.e., the correspondence between decan rulers and parts of the human body. Emerging from an Egyptian background, the decans were posi-tively described as healing powers;36 the “astrologer of the year 379” referred to the Hermetic text Iatromathematica that introduced the planets of the decans as rulers of human diseases;37 Teukros of Babylon likewise seemed to follow this tradition;38 but the major interceder of Egyptian iatromathematics was Ptolemy: “The Egyptians completely united medicine and astrological prognosis.”39 The same can be said of magic—often functioning as “applied astrology.” Thus, Jan Assmann remarks that “the most typical functional context of magic, in Egypt, is medicine, and the physician is the normal magician.”40 That the Jewish Testament of Solomon has to be linked to these Egyptian doctrines, is further attested in an anonymous Greek-Jewish Decan Book41 that 35 Gundel (1936), pp. 49–62; 286–7. For further literature on the decan tradition see von Stuckrad (2000b), p. 399 note 261; cf. also Mastrocinque (2005), pp. 173–183.36 In a very old magical papyrus the 36 parts of the body are already mentioned, perhaps in concordance with the decan system; see Koch (1993), p. 533; on the age of this text see also Quack (1995), p. 102. 37 Likewise, in the Apocryphon of John the decans are not so much healing powers but demons ruling over the different parts of the body, probably more likely to cause illness than healing.38 See Cumont in CCAG V, 1, 209, 9ff.; VIII, 4, 196, 1; Gundel 1936, 282ff.; Gundel and Gundel (1966), pp. 16ff. On the Egyptian element in Teukros cf. Boll (1903), pp. 158ff. Quack (1995, p. 121) assumes that Teukros is a link between Egyptian astrol-ogoumena, the so-called Salmeshiniaka, the Book of Zoroaster, and the Apocryphon of John from Nag Hammadi.39 Tetrabiblos 1:3. Barton certainly has a point in asking why we should doubt the judgment of such a scholar. Rather, this is further evidence for the fact “that the origins of the networks of correspondences between astrological entities, stones and plants may have been in Egyptian medicine, famed already in the age of Homer, and that they were probably elaborated in Hermetic writings” (Barton 1995, p. 186). Cra-mer (1954, p. 194) links Ptolemy’s iatromathematics to his discussion of fatalism and volition.40 Assmann (1997), p. 4.41 Kroll provided a first edition in CCAG VI, pp. 73–78; see Gundel (1936), pp. 385ff. For Gundel, the Egyptian origin of these doctrines is beyond any doubt, as a comparison of the twelfth decan in the present text with the Egyptian Book of the Dead chapter 162 suggests; regarding the magical power of the decans, Gundel states that the Greek-Jewish Decan Book comprises “the most extensive table of this kind known from antiquity, which especially refers to the magical power of the decan amulets” (Gundel 1936, 292)."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"256 kocku von stuckraddescribed the magical incantation of decans for all zodiacal signs as appropriate means to cure illnesses, as in the following example: “The third decan [of Aries] is called Delphaa. You write it [i.e. its name] with Zaphora and rose extract, made of honey, in green jasper and drink it. It heals teeth pain and pains in the throat. [On the margin Venus].” Certainly, the demonization of the decans is a new step of astral magic taken in the macroform of Solomonic magic between 200 BCE and 200 CE. The transformation is directly attested in the Testament of Solomon. In chapter 18, probably originating in second-century BCE Egypt, the demons are introduced as the “world rulers of this dark age,” but here their number is 36 (mirroring the 36 decans). The stars appear in various forms, some human, others with a dog’s head, as bulls, dragons, birds or sphinxes. Self-assured they say to Solomon: “But you, King, are not able to harm us or to lock us up; but since God gave you authority over all the spirits of the air, the earth, and (the regions) beneath the earth, we have also taken our place before you like the other spirits” (18:3). After having investigated all the names and activities of the 36 demons, Solomon declares: “When I, Solo-mon, heard these things, I glorified the God of heaven and earth and I ordered them to bear water; Then I prayed to God that the thirty-six demons who continually plague humanity go to the Temple of God” (18:41–42).Let us take a brief look now at the astrological doctrines that under-lie the Testament of Solomon. The lines of correspondences show no determinable common traditions. By way of example, the connection between Aquarius and Virgo (2:2, see above)—standing in the minor quincunx aspect—is not attested as significant in astrological litera-ture. Manilius talks of Sagittarius who “is in love with Virgo only,” and Ptolemy assures his readers that a quincunx is irrelevant for inter-pretation.42 However, this is not due to the Jewish author’s lacking acquaintance with astrological tradition but to the simple fact that, up to Ptolemy’s outstanding work, there was no such common tradition available. All texts, however, shared the doctrine of correspondences that is the backbone of astrological hermeneutics. This perspective found its way into the Testament of Solomon, as well:42 Manilius Astron. 2:504–506; Ptolemy Tetrabib. 1:17."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" astral magic in ancient jewish discourse 257(20:14) I asked him, “Tell me, then, how you, being demons, are able to ascend into heaven.” (15) He replied, “Whatever things are accom-plished in heaven (are accomplished) in the same way also on earth; for the principalities and authorities and powers above fly around and are considered worthy of entering heaven.”It is important to note that the astrological techniques are not bla-med in the text. Instead, the document’s contribution to ancient dis-courses is the following: the doctrine of correspondences is not to be disputed. Knowledge of those correspondences—astrology—leads to a deep understanding of future events (see also Testament of Solomon 2:3; 20:12). To obtain that knowledge one has to control the demonic powers which inhabit the zodiacal sphere. Astrology, it appears, is a sacred gift from God, embraced thankfully by man.Veneration of PlanetsIn addition to, and often in combination with, the discursive struc-ture of “controlling the angelic powers,” ancient magic shows an asto-nishing interest in devotion to planetary entities.43 This is remarkable insofar as according to a normative view of monotheistic theology, the veneration of stars—idolatry—was regarded as forbidden. This pre-sumption has led some scholars to the conclusion that evidence of star cult can by definition not be evidence of Jewish authors. This, of course, is far too simple. Hans Dieter Betz correctly notes with regard to magical spells that we cannot determine the religious background of their authors in a general way. Instead, “the examples of Jewish magic present a complicated but illuminating picture, and that the question of the Jewishness of each particular spell may have to be answered from case to case, depending on the types of texts involved.”44 Having analyzed three spells of the Papyri Graecae Magicae (PGM), he conclu-des: “What makes them Jewish are the quotations from Scripture”45—nothing more. In a similar vein, Mastrocinque aptly notes that “it must not be forgotten that magic texts were not part of a religion that can be labelled as ‘magic’, because there was no such thing. Those who practised magic worshipped Isis, Sarapis and Horus, or Hecate and 43 For a more detailed discussion of this topic see von Stuckrad (2000b), pp. 512–533.44 Betz (1997), p. 47.45 Ibid., 59."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"258 kocku von stuckradApollo, or the Hebrew god, or the saviour-Messiah, and frequently worshipped all these gods together.”46With regard to planetary veneration, there is also no reason to exclude this religious practice from ancient “Judaism.” Instead, we will have to reckon with the possibility that Jews took part in an ongoing discourse of ritual involvement with planetary divinities. Perhaps the best evidence for this religious matrix or pattern is the “Book of Myste-ries,” the Sepher ha-Razīm (SHR), originating in the first centuries CE but compiled later.47 According to the preface, this book explains how to master the investigation of the strata of the heavens, to go about in all that is in their seven abodes, to observe all the astrological signs, to examine the course of the sun, to explain the observations of the moon, and to know the paths of the Great Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, to declare the names of the overseers of each and every firmament and the realms of their authority, and by what means they (can be made to) cause success in each thing (asked of them), and what are the names of their attendants and what (oblations) are to be poured out to them, and what is the proper time (at which they will hear prayer, so as) to perform every wish of anyone (who comes) near them in purity.48The genealogy of “sages,” known from Mishna Pirque Abot 1:1 to lead to the rabbinic sages, is now revealed to all adepts of ritual magic. Interestingly enough, in SHR the chain of revelation does not end with the chachamim but adds King Solomon to the list.49Repeatedly, the adept is requested to pour libation or sacrifice incense, or even animals, to the celestial bodies, thus revealing a totally different attitude toward cultic purity than more ‘orthodox’ theology would prescribe. For example:46 Mastrocinque (2005), p. 45. Mastrocinque’s study is an important contribution to the development of gnostic and Jewish magic and astrology in late antiquity, even if—or because—some of his conclusions are controversial.47 An edition of SHR still is a scholarly desideratum, cf. von Stuckrad (2000b), pp. 523–532. In his first collection, Mordechai Margalioth (1966) put together the SHR as a macroform on the basis of quite distinct fragments, particularly from the Cairo Genizah, medieval codices, and collections such as Sefer Raziel, Sefer Kamayōt, Sefer hamalbūsh, or Mafteach Shlomo; see Morgan (1983), pp. 2–6; Leicht (2005), pp. 241–242. Gruenwald notes that “Margalioth tampered with the text, in some cases even where the manuscripts supply good and interesting readings” (1980, p. 226).48 “Preface” to SHR, 5–10 (Morgan 1983, pp. 17–18).49 “Preface” to SHR, 23–26 (Morgan 1983, p. 19)."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" astral magic in ancient jewish discourse 259If you wish to speak with the moon or with the stars about any matter, take a white cock and fine flour, then slaughter the cock (so that its blood is caught) in “living water” [חיים מיים].50 Knead the flour with the water and blood and make three cakes and place them in the sun, and write on them with the blood the name(s) of (the angels of ) the fifth encampment and the name of its overseer and put the three of them on a table of myrtle wood, stand facing the moon or facing the stars and say: I adjure you to bring the planet of N and his star51 near to the star and planet of N, so his love will be tied with the heart of N son of N.52Another example shows the close relation between astral magic, mys-tical discourse, and the Hekhalot literature. It has the objective to observe the sun (Helios) at night on its way “in the North.”53 After several purification ceremonies and dietetic measurements, the magi-cian utters 21 times the names of the sun and the angels that accom-pany it. Then follows the adjuration:In the name of the Holy King who walks upon the wings of the wind,54 by the letters of the complete name that was revealed to Adam in the Garden of Eden, (by)55 the Ruler of the planets, and the sun, and the moon, who bow down before Him as slaves before their masters, by the name of the wondrous God, I adjure you, that you will make known to me this great miracle that I desire, and that I may see the sun in his power in the (celestial ) circle (traversed by) his chariot, and let no hidden thing be too difficult for me.56While this adjuration is still in accordance with the pious Jewish subordination of angels under the rule of God, the next passage reveals a theologically more tolerant position. Here, Helios is addressed directly:50 This “living water” is important not only in ritual practice but also in Baptist milieus, for instance for Mandaeans. Do we come across a shared theology here? On the function of water in Hekhalot texts cf. also Morray-Jones (2002).51 Here, SHR applies the same language that the rabbis used to depict the planetary influences—one’s star or mazzal; on the מזל see von Stuckrad (2000b), pp. 472–473; 480–483.52 SHR 1:161–167 (Morgan 1983, pp. 36–37). Probably this ritual is compiled from two different texts, because the adjuration does not really fit the ritual’s objectives. The aspect of veneration melts here with the aspect of adjuration. And cf. the detailed analysis of this passage in Ithamar Gruenwald’s paper in the present volume.53 See 1 Enoch 72:5.54 See Ps. 104:3.55 Morgan reads במושל instead of המושל. However, such an emendation is super-fluous, because המושל relates to the “Holy King” as ruler of the planets and not nec-essarily to Adam.56 SHR 4:51–57 (Morgan 1983, pp. 70–71)."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"260 kocku von stuckradHoly Helios who rises in the east, good mariner, trustworthy leader of the sun’s rays, reliable (witness), who of old didst establish the mighty wheel (of the heavens), holy orderer, ruler of the axis (of the heaven), Lord, Brilliant Leader, King, Soldier.

Not only is Helios revealer of superior knowledge; the author even praises him as the creator of the cosmic order. That is why Margalioth called the Sepher ha-Razīm a “heretical work.”58 Ithamar Gruenwald adopts a more nuanced posi-tion, asking “whether a book like Sefer Ha-Razim, and similar material contained in manuscripts, does not betray, in a more reliable manner than do the rabbinic writings, the nature and scope of these occult practices among the common people.”59 However, as noted above, the lay status of SHR and related documents is by no means certain.60 Mastering correspondences and ritual practice afforded experience and knowledge; hence, for SHR we must note the same as for the PGM: “We have to assume that for the prescribed performance of the magical ritual the magician had to know the astrological systematics, and also had to have access to respective charts or astrological handbooks.”61If we are looking for macroforms and shared patterns of magi-cal discourse, a comparison of SHR with PGM is an obvious choice. Repeatedly, the planetary divinities are praised and adjured, which I want to exemplify with PGM IV here.62 PGM IV.2241–2358, is an extensive adjuration of the moon that several times underscores the divinity of the earth’s satellite:57 SHR 4:60–66 (Morgan 1983, p. 71).58 Margalioth (1966), pp. 14ff.59 Gruenwald (1980), p. 230.60 In SHR 1:94–96, for instance, the author suggests to consult a hieratic papyrus to predict the future and to write the message down in hieratic script. This is certainly not aiming at “common people.”61 Gundel (1968), referring to PGM V.62 For a good overview of astrological connotations within the PGM see Gundel (1968), pp. 3–17 (Sun), pp. 17–25 (decans), pp. 25–41 (Moon), pp. 41–52 (planets). Gundel correctly stresses the significant doctrine of correspondences (see p. 39).

The magician developed a personal relation with these divinities that ranged from reverent praise to instrumentalization. This is true not only for Selene/moon and Helios/sun, but also for Hermes/Mercurius, Aphrodite/Venus, or simply “the gods” to whom long hymns and prayers are documented in PGM.63 PGM IV.2241–2247, trans.

The final sen-tence demonstrates the clear connection between astral-magical ritual and astrological divination: “If you see the star shining steadily, it is a sign that she has been smitten, and if it is lengthened like the flame of a lamp, she has already come.”67The magical papyri are not the only sources that reveal the liturgical and magical function of planetary divinities. I have argued elsewhere that for Manichaeism, Hermeticism and gnostic discourse this feature of religious practice and worldview was indeed ubiquitous—despite the diversity of theological positions that we find in the documents.68Heavenly JourneysAccording to ancient understanding, the secrets of divine astronomy were revealed to a few religious specialists who made their way into the heavens or received their knowledge by God’s own intervention: 66 PGM IV.2893–2900, trans. Betz (1986), p. 92. Gundel notes: “In the ingredients of the sacrifice we can easily discern the sympathetic relationship with goddess and celestial body: Blood and fat of a white dove, myrrh, and Artemisia belong to Venus. The ‘vulture’s brain,’ the ‘right mandible of a female donkey,’ or a ‘red sacrificed calf ’ and the ‘cord of Anubis’ connect the vision of the star with the simultaneous vision of the divinities Horus, Anubis, Seth, and the cow-headed Isis or Hathor” (Gundel 1968, pp. 48–49).67 PGM IV.2940–2941, trans.

But secret knowledge was attributed not only to those extraordinary persons. Many people in Late Antiquity were engaged in heavenly journeys in order to gain insight into the mysteries of God’s cosmic order. Connected with that mystical orientation was an application of astrological skills in a way one would call magical. In Late Antiquity, this topic is so common that Ithamar Gruenwald notes: These heavenly ascents of the soul became almost a cultural fashion in many religious systems in the first centuries of the Christian Era, the spiritual climate of which was full of a constant exchange of religious ideas and practices. In this respect there was no substantial difference between religion, philosophy and science.69Heavenly journeys are a key motif within gnostic and Hermetic theolo-gies, but—contrasting the Hekhalot mysticism where the mystic serves as a mediator between God and Israel—here the intentions are indivi-dual ones. One may only recall the famous passage of Poimandres that was so influential—and controversial—in subsequent esotericism, as it inaugurates the divinization of the adept.Thence the human being rushes up through the cosmic framework, at the first zone surrendering the energy of increase and decrease; at the second evil machination, a device now inactive; at the third the illusion of longing, now inactive; at the fourth the ruler’s arrogance, now freed of excess; at the fifth unholy presumption and daring recklessness; at the sixth the evil impulses that come from wealth, now inactive; and at the seventh zone the deceit that lies in ambush. And then, stripped of the effects of the cosmic framework, the human enters the region of the ogdoad; he has his own proper power, and along with the blessed he hymns the father. [. . .] They rise up to the father in order and surrender themselves to the powers, and, having become powers, they enter into god. This is the final good for those who have received knowledge: to be made god.70The gnostic searches for redemption either in the world to come or during her or his lifetime. Pursuing this goal, it is of crucial impor-tance “to know one’s enemies”—i.e., to understand the heavenly oppo-nents who try to block the mystic’s way into the realms of light. This 69 Gruenwald (1988), p. 202 with no. 30. See on this topic Dean-Otting (1984); Himmelfarb (1993).70 CH I:25–26, trans. Copenhaver (1992), p. 6.

In the First Apocalypse of James from Nag Hammadi it is Jesus himself who gave instructions: He admonishes his disciples to be confidential since, after his grievous way through death, he will return and “appear for a reproof to the archons. And I shall reveal to them that he cannot be seized. If they seize him, then he will overpower each of them.”71The recipient of the holy revelation is rescued from the powers of heimarmenē and can depart from this dark world heading through the planetary spheres toward the pleroma. In order to fulfill this desire it seemed appropriate to examine the planetary laws thoroughly. Thus, the fight against the stoicheia led the gnostic to a different reaction than Paul who refuted astrology. What at first glance seems inconsis-tent becomes the gnostics’ primary motivation for studying astrology. Just because gnostic theology strives to overcome the demonic plane-tary chains, it made extensive use of astrological tradition.The gnostic interest in astrology resulted in an extraordinary dis-course of its own. Special treatises have come down to us elaborated by Markos and Theodotus, both Valentinians, by Bardaisan of Edessa and—last but not least—by Mani. Summarizing the feature of gnostic astrology one comes to the conclusion that, besides the topic of hea-venly journeys and magical empowerment, it is the doctrine of corres-pondences that is of particular importance.72 This doctrine was applied to different manifestations such as the twelve apostles, to zodiacal geo-graphy, or zodiacal medicine (melothesia). In most cases the doctrines of the astrological tradition were well-known, at times even to a very sophisticated degree. Of further interest is the fact that the influence of Egyptian doctrines, particularly the decan system with its implemen-tation of the numbers 36 and 72, had an important impact on gnostic astrology’s proceedings.The subjugation of the planets and their subsequent instrumenta-lization are fully in line with texts originating from Jewish milieus. 71 NHC 5.3:30,2–6 (Robinson 1988, p. 264). See also the 2nd Book of Jeû ch. 52; the Left Ginza 3:56; NHC 7.127:20f. Those documents witness the correctness of Origenes’ bold remarks in c. Cels. 7.40 and 6.30f.72 See esp. the doctrines of Markos as described in Irenaeus Adv. haer. 1.14,3–6; Epiphanius Panarion 34.5. Theodotus was the first to explore the correspondences between zodiacal signs and apostles, see Excerpta ex Theodoto 25.2. Bardaisan “has to be called the first significant astrologer within the wider perspective of Christian-ity” (Gundel and Gundel 1966, p. 326); that was witnessed by Eusebius Praep. evang. 6.9,32."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" astral magic in ancient jewish discourse 265Furthermore, the visionary’s search for a heavenly journey calls simi-lar texts of the Hekhalot tradition to mind; even rabbinical parallels may be mentioned.73 But there are also marked differences. One such difference is, as noted above, the aspect of individual salvation promi-nent in gnostic texts, while the yored merqabah is acting on behalf of his community. Linked to this functional difference is another one—namely, the temporary nature of the heavenly journeys of Hekhalot texts. The yored merqabah ascends the heavens and returns to report to his people about what he experienced. A third difference pertains to the evaluation of stars and serving angels;74 for the Hekhalot mystic, the angels are usually friendly entities, assigned to keep the unworthy out of the highest heavens. The gnostics, however, usually identify the angels with the archons that are dependent on the Demiurge.75I have argued elsewhere that these differences—and also the differen-ces within the Hekhalot literature—have to be taken seriously.76 And I agree with Ithamar Gruenwald that “it seems very likely that some of the Gnostic writers were indeed familiar with certain aspects of the Merkavah tradition, while the opposite—that is, the adaptation by the Merkavah mystics of specific Gnostic doctrines—cannot so easily be proved.”77 At the same time, it is apparent that the Hekhalot mystics, the authors of gnostic literature and others shared a common view of religious experts entering the heavenly spheres in order to explore divine secrets. That is the discursive macroform that materializes in a variety of microforms, the latter clearly displaying the different—and often competing—claims and worldviews of the respective groups and milieus.From a methodological point of view, the three discursive fields that I have discussed—the control of cosmic powers, the veneration of planets and the heavenly journeys of religious specialists—challenge 73 The rabbinic tradition is focused on R. Aqiba; see tChag 2:3; jChag 77b; bChag 14b.74 Here we come across the same positive function of the angels as attested in the Qumran literature, particularly in the Shirot Olat ha-Shabbat. On the astrological con-notation of the priestly cult in Qumran, see von Stuckrad (2000b), pp. 168–183. From this point of view, there is much to argue in favor of Rachel Elior’s thesis of continu-ation of priestly traditions in Hekhalot literature; see Elior (1997). A nuanced discus-sion of astrology in Qumran is now provided by Popović (2007).75 On these differences see Gruenwald (1988), pp. 192–193; see also Maier (1963), pp. 39–40.76 See von Stuckrad (2000b), pp. 681–686, with references.77 Gruenwald (1988), p. 201."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"266 kocku von stuckradsimple demarcations that have dominated scholarly analyses of Judaism’s relation to astrology and magic. It turns out that the very notion of a singular “Judaism”—as well as of “Christianity”—is diffi-cult to retain. What we witness in the sources of Late Antiquity is a creative blend of various influences that added to Jewish identities. Jews were involved in and connected to ongoing debates in ancient society. While some milieus tried to protect their identity by bloc-king out what was seen as “pagan practices,” there were many Jewish milieus that embraced these doctrines as an important element of their worldview and practice. The demarcation lines that divided ancient society were not so much related to “religions” as to philosophical, metaphysical and ritual considerations.ReferencesAmand, D. 1945.

This, we will probably never know. But if we ask when Jewish sources start to speak about planets, we are confronted with a surprise: For a very long period, we find virtually nothing about planets in Jewish culture. Neither the Hebrew Bible nor the post-biblical Jewish literature of the Second Temple period provide us with any substantial knowledge about those “wan-dering stars,” and even Qumran—which has otherwise preserved a small but highly significant collection of texts dealing with astrology, astronomy and calendar issues—is largely silent about planets.This exclusion of the planets from Jewish culture is quite striking. One could ask oneself whether this is a tendentious condemnation of a knowledge that was deemed dangerous or at least incompatible with Jewish religion, but this will not be the focus of the present paper. Here, we will follow a different line: In contrast to biblical times and Second Temple Judaism, some basic knowledge about planets and their role in astrology becomes ubiquitous in traditional Jewish learn-ing in Late Antiquity and in the Middle Ages. After the long period of total silence, planets were suddenly rising on the horizon of Jewish texts, and more than that, they fulfilled an important role in certain astrological practices. This is quite a surprising phenomenon: How could it come about that a number of basic tenets of planetary astronomy and astrology eventually did find their way into the core Jewish traditions after any reminiscence was banned during centuries? How did the silenced outcasts of Jewish culture in Antiquity assume a place of honor, and how was the tendentious exclusion transformed into a most honorable inclusion?"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"272  reimund  leichtThe absence of planets in ancient Jewish sourcesWith the exception of Saturn, which is mentioned with its Akkadian name Kewan (Kiyyun) in Amos 5:26, and the doubtful translation of ʿAsh as Hesperos (Venus as the evening star) in the Septuagint version of Job 38:32, there are no unambiguous references to the planets, i.e. the five “real” planets Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury in the Hebrew Bible.1 This absence of any detailed knowledge about the planets is perhaps not totally surprising in view of the general scarcity of astronomical and astrological knowledge in the Hebrew Bible in general.2 It remains nevertheless remarkable, since astronomy, astro-logy and the belief in astral deities played an enormous role in Assy-rian and Babylonian culture. Accordingly, it seems quite possible that some kind of astral piety and religious practice did have some impact on ancient Israel, and was thus refuted by some of the prophets.3 But be this as it may, there is no positive evidence that forces us to assume that any aspect of planetary astronomy or astrology was known in greater detail in biblical times.4The same observation holds true for most of the Second Temple period. This is perhaps slightly more surprising given the fact that dur-ing the Hellenistic period astrology underwent one of its peaks, and one might expect that it would have been rather easy for Jews to create literary contexts, where the planets could have found a decent place in Jewish literature. Consider, for example, the astronomical teachings of chapters 72–82 of 1 Enoch, where the planets, which are next to the sun and the moon the most striking astronomical entities visible in the sky, are conspicuously absent. Attempts have been made to fill this gap by interpreting the “seven stars,” which “transgressed God’s 1 On star names in the Hebrew Bible cf.

The religious and astrological orientation of human beings toward the planets may have been seen as a “lapis offensionis,”6 but at any rate, the planets are virtually inexistent in 1 Enoch.Whereas a re-insertion of the planets into the cosmology of 1 Enoch by means of sophisticated interpretations might be possible, it is even more difficult to detect a closer familiarity with planetary astron-omy or astrology in other literary sources of the period. Attempts to “prove” the influence of astrological speculations, most notably that of the theory of the Great Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, on the political events during the Hasmonean and Herodian eras, are pure guesswork, and scholars advocating such an interpretation presuppose a general familiarity with this astrological concept as a petitio prin-cipii rather than being able to deduce it from their literary sources.7 Similarly, the re-discovery of the planets and their angels in various texts belonging to the Qumran community is possible only at the cost of enormous interpretative detours.8 The same corpus of texts, which has preserved some unambiguous sources for astrological practices9 and an almost complete list of the Aramaic names of the signs of the zodiac in the brontologion 4Q318,10 remains silent as soon as it comes to speak about planets. 5 Cf. the passages speaking about irregular movements of stars in 1 Enoch 75:2; 80:6.7; 82:2; for a discussion cf.

Both authors are oriented toward a Greek-speaking audience to such an extent that we cannot deduce from these texts that their interpretation necessarily reflects beliefs current among Jews in the first century CE.Furthermore, we have to assume that the Jewish astrologers who composed Greek astrological texts attributed to Abraham (probably in Hellenistic Egypt) knew about the planets,13 but even from the frag-ments preserved here we cannot seize a single piece of clear evidence dealing with planets. Finally, the observance of extraordinary celes-tial phenomena connected with Jesus’ birth (Matthew 2:1–12) are too vague to prove the opposite.To sum up, from the whole period preceding the destruction of the Second Temple, we possess not a single piece of evidence from Jewish culture testifying to a more intimate knowledge of planetary astron-omy or astrology. As a consequence, close to nothing is known about the “status” of the planets in Jewish culture. We cannot even tell their Hebrew or Aramaic names. It probably would be a rash conclusion to argue that this is to be interpreted as the outcome of intentional cen-sorship. It is equally possible that the lack of interest was due to the fact that there was no urgent need to deal with planets at all. Nothing forces men to think about planets as long as their daily life is regu-lated; even if more sophisticated problems arise, such as the question of the fixing of the correct calendar, this does not necessarily imply an interest in planets at all. This situation, however, would change in later centuries.The first steps toward an inclusion: Planets in the TalmudMany aspects of the development of the present Jewish calendar prior to its implementation traditionally associated with Hillel II in 358/59 CE remain obscure.

Accordingly, in this very period we encounter some unambiguous expressions of the high esteem in which the study of the calendar and astronomy was held among the rabbis. An example in case is Bar Qap-para, a tanna of the fifth generation, who is reported to have said that “everyone who knows to calculate the tequfot and mazzalot and does not calculate (them)—Scripture says about him (Is 5:12): And they do not look at the work of the Lord and the doing of his hands they did not see” (bShab 75a).15 Variant versions of the same dictum circulated for Rav, a Babylonian amora of the first generation (“Who knows to cal-culate the tequfot and mazzalot and does not calculate [them]—one does not talk to him“),16 and for R. Yohanan, a Palestinian amora of the second generation (“From where do we know that it is a com-mandment for man to calculate the tequfot and mazzalot? Because it is said [Deut 4:6]: And you shall preserve and do it, because it is your wisdom and your understanding in front of the nations.—this means: the calculation of tequfot and mazzalot.”)17Since this is not the place to discuss the whole problem of the Jewish calendar, a few details relevant for these quoted dicta suffice. The cal-culation of the tequfot mentioned by Bar Qappara, Rav and Yohanan clearly refers to the attempts made at that time to fix the length of the tropical solar year and, concomitantly, to make a precise calcula-tion of the length of the four seasons defined by the equinoxes and 14 Cf. on the development of the Jewish calendar Adolf Schwarz, Der jüdische Kalender historisch und astronomisch untersucht (Breslau, 1872); Ludwig Basnitzki, Der jüdische Kalender.

For our purpose it is of little relevance that Jewish tradition has adopted two different lengths of the solar year: Mar Shemuel, a Babylonian amora of the first generation, fixed the length of a tequfah to 91 days and 7 1/2 hours, based on a solar year consisting of 365 days and 6 hours, which is identical with the Julian calendar, whereas one generation later, the Babylonian amora Adda is reported to have calculated the tequfah at 91 days, 7 hours, 519 halaqim and 31 regaʿim, summing up to a solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, 997 halaqim and 48 regaʿim.18 What is more important for us is that given the fact that the very first tequfah of Nisan was believed to have fallen on Wednesday 0 hours (i.e. 6 p.m.), all the following tequfot of Nisan, Tammuz, Tishre and Tevet happen to fall on different hours of the day according to a fixed pattern. This pattern is expounded in another passage of the Babylonian Talmud (bEr 56a):Shemuel said: The tequfah of Nisan falls in the four quarters of the day only: either in the beginning of the day, or the beginning of the night or the middle of the day or the middle of the night. The tequfah of Tammuz falls either in the first or the seventh and a half only, be it during the day or the night. The tequfah of Tishre falls in three hours or nine hours only, be it during the day or the night. The tequfah of Tevet falls in the fourth and the tenth and a half only, be it during the day or during the night. And between one tequfah and the other there are 91 days and seven and a half hours only, and one tequfah never attracts more than half an hour of the other one.19Mar Shemuel’s year thus counts 365 days and 6 hours, and the tequ-fah of Nisan progresses 1 day and 6 hours every year (i.e., first year: 0 hours [6 p.m.] of Tuesday; second year: 6 hours [0:00 a.m.] of Thur-sday; third year: 12 hours [6 a.m.] of Thursday etc.) to the effect that the tequfah reverts to the original weekday every 28 years. In principle it would have been possible to count weekdays and hours simply by numerals as was done in the texts quoted above and is still customary today (yom rishon, sha‘ah shesh etc.), but there is evidence that the rabbis adopted a system of planetary rulers for both 18 One hour contains 1080 halaqim, one heleq 76 regaʿim.19 bEr 56a: בתחלת או היום רבעי בארבעה אלא נופלת ניסן תקופת אין :שמואל אמר ומחצה באחת או אלא נופלת תמוז תקופת ואין .הלילה בחצי או היום בחצי או הלילה שעות בשלש או אלא נופלת תשרי תקופת ואין .בלילה ובין ביום בין ומחצה בשבע או ומחצה בארבע או אלא נופלת טבת תקופת אין .בלילה ובין ביום בין שעות בתשע או יום ואחד תשעים אלא לתקופה תקופה בין ואין .בלילה ובין ביום בין ומחצה בעשר או שעה חצי אלא מחברתה מושכת תקופה ואין ומחצה שעות ושבע."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" the beginnings of jewish astrology 277the days of the week and for the hours of each day (Sun-day, Mon-day etc.) at a relatively early stage. The origins of this “planetary week” are still unknown, but as Franz Boll pointed out, “it is beyond any doubt that the lunar week [of seven days—R. L.] existed long before the idea occurred to dedicate each day of the week to one planet.”20 The earliest direct evidence for the asso-ciation of the seven planets Saturn—Sun—Moon—Mars—Mercury—Jupiter—Venus with the seven days of the week is relatively late. It cannot be dated earlier than the first century BCE. Various technical explanations were given for the basic ideas underlying this system, but it seems quite likely that the one provided by Vettius Valens, an astrologer of the second century CE, is historically seen as the correct one. In chapter I:10 of his Anthologiae he reports that planetary rulers were first allotted to each hour of the weekdays, from where the pla-netary rulers of the days were then deduced. The underlying order of the planets reflects their distance from the earth:21The order of the stars in relation to the days is as follows: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn. The arrangement of the zones is: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. From this arrange-ment the hours receive their designation, from the hours the day of the star one after the other.20 Franz Boll, art. “Hebdomas” in Paulys Realencyclopädie der classischen Alter-tumswissenschaft, vol. 14 (München, 1912), col. 2547–2578, on col. 2556; cf. also A.

Accordingly, the ruler of the first hour of a day is always also the planetary ruler of the whole day:Saturday1., 8., 15., 22. Saturn2., 9., 16., 23. Jupiter3., 10., 17., 24. Mars4., 11., 18.

Based on a rather complex argument Solomon Gandz, for example, was con-vinced that it is purely Jewish invention: As we have seen above, the whole system logically starts with Saturn as the first planetary ruler. Now, Saturn’s rule falls on Tuesday evening 6 p.m. This, however, is quite conspicuous, because such a fixation seems to presuppose that the stars were created on that day, just as it can be found in Gen 1:14–19. Gandz therefore believes that the creation of the stars “was the natural point of departure for the cycle of the planetary hours, and this first hour was dedicated to Saturn, and all the rest followed the"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" the beginnings of jewish astrology 279natural and generally accepted order of the planets—i.e. חנכ״ל שצ״ם, or SaJuMa SuVeMeMo.” Accordingly, he comes to the conclusion that from a historical point of view this system was introduced in Rome in the second century BCE (p. 224) by Jewish astrologers, who were familiar with the biblical account of the creation.22However speculative Gandz’s interpretation might be, some kind of Jewish influence on the development of the system of planetary rulers cannot be ruled out. In chapter I:10 of Vettius Valens’ Anthologiae, for example, which bears the title “On the heptazônos, [i.e. the sab-batical day]—off-hand” we find the opening words: “About the week [and the sabbatical day] it is like this . . .”.23 The references to the Sab-bath in this passage are considered by David Pingree, the editor of the most recent critical edition of the Anthologiae, as later glosses. This possibility cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, it should be noted that pagan authors also quite often explain Jewish Sabbath observance as being related to the dominance of Saturn on this day.24 Not all of them, however, necessarily deduce from this fact that the whole system of planetary rulers must be of Jewish origin. Dio Cassius, for example, a pagan historian of the second century CE, reports in a long chapter of his Roman History (XXXVII, 18), which deals with the Jewish God and the observance of the Sabbath:25Now as for him, who he is and why he has been so honored, and how they got their superstitious awe of him, accounts have been given by many, and moreover these matters have naught to do with this history. The custom, however, of referring the days to the seven stars called pla-nets was instituted by the Egyptians, but is now found among all man-kind, though its adoption has been comparatively recent; at any rate the ancient Greeks never understood it, so far as I am aware. But since it is now quite the fashion with mankind generally and even with the Romans themselves, and is to them already in a way an ancestral tra-dition, I wish to write briefly of it, telling how and in what way it has 22 Solomon Gandz, “The Origin of the Planetary Week or The Planetary Week in Hebrew Literature,” in PAAJR 18 (1948/49): 213–254.23 Vettius Valens, Anthologiae, ed.

I have heard two explanations, which are not difficult of comprehension, it is true, though they involve certain theories. For if you apply the so-called ‘principle of the tetrachord’ (which is believed to constitute the basis of music) to these stars, by which the whole universe of heaven is divided into regular intervals, in the order in which each of them revolves, and beginning at the outer orbit assigned to Saturn, then omitting the next two name the lord of the fourth, and after this passing over two others reach the seventh, and you then go back and repeat the process with the orbits and their presiding divinities in this same manner, assigning them to the several days, you will find all the days to be in a kind of musical connection with the arrangement of the heavens. This is one of the explanations given; the other is as follows. If you begin at the first hour to count the hour of the day and of the night, assigning the first to Saturn, the next to Jupiter, the third to Mars, the fourth to the Sun, the fifth to Venus, the sixth to Mercury, and the seventh to the Moon, according to the order of the cycles which the Egyptians observe, and if you repeat the process, covering thus the whole twenty-four hours, you will find that the first hour of the following day comes to the Sun. And if you carry on the operation throughout the next twenty-four hours, in the same manner as with the others, you will dedicate the first hour of the third day to the Moon, and if you proceed similarly through the rest, each day will receive its appropriate god. This, then, is the tradition.Accordingly, the degree of Jewish contribution to the development of the planetary week in general is difficult to assess. It seems quite likely, however, that the planetary week is the product of a long pro-cess of assimilation and amalgamation of different but parallel ele-ments, some of which were Jewish, others Egyptian and others Greek or Roman. Accordingly, far-reaching hypotheses as to the great age of Jewish familiarity with the system of planetary weekdays and hours are unfounded and moreover not corroborated by the observations about the beginnings of planetary astronomy and astrology in Judaism made in this paper. As we will see, there are no unambiguous sources testi-fying to the possibility that Jews used the concept of planetary rulers prior to the turn of the 3rd century CE.One of the first pieces of evidence for a Jewish acquaintance with the system of planetary rulers of weekdays and hours is to be found in a sugya from the Babylonian Talmud (bEr 56a), which we had occa-sion to mention above. In this text Mar Shemuel exposes his astrono-mical theories about the tequfot and the length of the solar year, but occasionally also slips into the field of astrology predicting that the occurrence of the tequfot in the hour of Jupiter will bring forth heavy (Nisan) and hot (Tevet) winds:"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" the beginnings of jewish astrology 281And Shemuel said: There is no tequfah of Nisan, which falls in (the hour of ) Jupiter and does not fell the trees, and there is no tequfah of Tevet, which falls in (the hour of ) Jupiter and does not dry the seeds.26For a slightly later period we can observe that the concept of the solar cycle of 28 years and the association of the hours of the tequfot with the planets even appears in halakhic discussions. In bBer59b we find the barayta:Our rabbis taught: He who sees the sun in its tequfah, the moon in its strength, and the stars in their paths and the mazzalot in their order, says: Blessed be He who made the creation,27which in all likelihood originally meant nothing but that one is obliged to say a benediction whenever one sees the sun on the days of the equinoxes and solstices, the full moon, the stars and the mazzalot. This, the redactors of the Talmud may have observed, might happen quite often, so that consequently the following Talmudic discussion tries to limit this practice to a much rarer occasion. “When does this happen?” (?הוי ואימת) they ask, and then provide us with an answer, which was given by a Babylonian amora of the fourth generation (ca. 280–339 CE):Abbaye said: Every 28 years, when the cycle repeats itself and the tequfah of Nisan falls in (the hour of ) Saturn in the evening of Tuesday before the morning of Wednesday.28The literary evidence thus indicates that the system of the planetary rulers for weekdays and hours was adopted in rabbinic Judaism in close connection with the theories concerning the calculation of the tequfot and the length of the tropical solar year.29 We can, however, go one step further: If we try to interpret our earliest piece of evidence quoted above—i.e., Bar Qappara’s dictum in bShab 75a that “everyone who knows to calculate the tequfot and 26 bEr 56a: את משברת שאינה בצדק שנופלת ניסן תקופת לך אין :שמואל ואמר הזרעים את מייבשת שאינה בצדק שנופלת טבת תקופת לך ואין האילנות. 27 bBer59b: ומזלות במסילותם וכוכבים בגבורתה לבנה בתקופתה חמה הרואה בראשית עושה ברוך :אומר כסדרן.28 bBer59b: ניסן תקופת ונפלה מחזור והדר שנין ושמונה עשרים כל :אביי אמר ארבע נגהי דתלת באורתא בשבתאי.29 The passage bEr 56a adds: בצדק או בלבנה או לבנה דאיתליד (מילי והני) והוא—“and this is the case if the New Moon is born either in (the hour of ) the moon or of Jupiter.” However, this transposition of the calculation of the tequfot to the New Moon is clearly secondary, both in literary and historical terms."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"282  reimund  leichtmazzalot and does not calculate (them)—Scripture says about him (Is 5:12): And they do not look at the work of the Lord and the doing of his hands they did not see,” we may ask ourselves, what the obligation to calculate the tequfot and mazzalot actually means? If the term tequfot is unambiguous, what does the term mazzalot mean in this context? A close reading of the Talmudic texts reveals that mazzalot must be interpreted in a specific technical meaning as referring to the ruling planet: Whoever is able to calculate the hour of the tequfah and to find out the ruling planet (mazzal) of this hour is obliged to do so! In other words, Bar Qappara’s dictum can be seen cum grano salis as being the earliest rabbinic evidence for the practice of planetary astro-logy as a mitzvah, which is considered by R. Yohanan to be nothing less than your wisdom and your understanding in front of the people (Deut 4:6).This interpretation is based upon the philological assumption that in all the texts quoted above the word mazzal designates “ruling pla-net” in the technical sense rather than “sign of the zodiac” or any other astral constellation, as is current in later rabbinic and medieval Hebrew.30 Such an interpretation, however, is corroborated by a com-parison with other Talmudic sources. The most famous among these is the discussion about Israel’s subordination to the mazzal in bShab 156a-b,31 where mazzal is again used in the specific sense of “planetary ruler”:32 The sugya begins with a long quotation from a pinqas attri-buted to Yehoshua‘ ben Levi, a Palestinian amora of the first gene-ration. It contains simple genethlialogical prognostications according to the weekday on which a person was born. These prognostications are interspersed with numerous minor discussions and interpreta-tions attributed to later amoraim such as Rav Ashi or R. Nahman bar Yizhaq. The main focus of this “interlinear” commentary, however, is the attempt to provide a systematic foundation of the moral charac-teristics attributed to a person born on a specific day in the events of the seven days of creation. It is striking that in this context the pro-gnostications given in the pinqas generally agree with the symbolism 30 In biblical Hebrew the word mazzalot appears only once in I Reg 23:5 in the expression השמים צבא ולכל ולמזלות לירח לשמש לבעל, which does not allow any definite conclusion regarding the exact meaning of the word.31 For detailed discussions of this passage cf. Stuckrad, ibid. pp. 460–480; Leicht, ibid., pp. 90–94.32 Cf. also bAZ 42b, “all the mazzalot permitted, apart from the mazzal of the sun and the moon”, which again allows an association with the planets rather than with the signs of the zodiac or other astral constellations."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" the beginnings of jewish astrology 283deduced from the creation story, whereas they disagree with what one would find in the classical astrological teachings about the “planetary character” of persons.33 Therefore, it seems quite likely that Yehoshuaʿ ben Levi intentionally tried to eliminate everything astrological in his short “genethlialogical treatise” by replacing them with biblical sym-bolism. On the other hand, it is patent that the following Talmudic discus-sion did not follow the Palestinian amora in this line. The Talmud totally ignores the anti-astrological intention of Yehoshuaʿ ben Levi’s pinqas and bluntly re-inserts astrology by telling us:R. Hanina said to them: Go and tell the son of Levi that it is not the maz-zal of the day but the mazzal of the hour which exercises its influence,34as if Yehoshuaʿ spoke in his pinqas of mazzalot rather than of the days of creation! What follow in the name of R. Hanina, however, are purely astrological prognostications, which—this time—are in total agreement with the moral qualities of the planets in classical astrology. The exact details of these prognostications expounded in bShab 156a are of little interest for us here. What is important for us is the fact that here the term mazzalot is used for the planetary rulers (mazzalot), which are being transposed here from the field of tequfot-astrology to the field of horoscopic astrology.35Another piece of evidence for planetary astrology from the same period of time is preserved in bShab 129b, where several issues related to blood-letting are being discussed. Here, Shemuel again proves to be a competent astrologer, when he declares:Shemuel said: Blood-letting on Sunday, Wednesday and Friday. [. . .] Why not Tuesday? For Mars rules an even-numbered hour. But on Fri-day, too, it rules an even-numbered hour?! Seeing that the majority of the people are in the habit of doing it (on Friday, we say:)—The Lord preserves the simple-minded (Ps 116:6).3633 E.g., the pinqas predicts that a person born on Tuesday will be a fornicator. This has, of course, nothing to do with the character of Mars, the planet ruling the third day of the week. It rather reflects the fact that on this day the grasses were created, which widely spread their seed (Gen 1:11).34 bShab 156a–b: גורם יום מזל לא לואי לבר ליה אמרו פוקו :חנינא רבי להו אמר גורם שעה מזל אלא.35 Cf. also the following passage in bShab 156a: מחכים מזל אומר חנינא רבי איתמר לישראל מזל אין אומר יוחנן רבי .לישראל מזל ויש מעשיר מזל.36 bShab 129b: אבל .שבתא ומעלי ארבעה בשבתא חד דדמא פורסא :שמואל אמר דין שבית ובחמישי בשני דם יקיז אבות זכות לו יש מי :מר דאמר לא—וחמישי שני"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"284  reimund  leichtTo sum up, we can observe that a vivid interest in calendar reckoning prevailed at the turn of the 2nd to the 3rd century CE. These efforts yielded the fixation of the solar year and brought about the adoption of methods for the determination of the four tequfot. In order to desi-gnate these points of the annual cycle, the rabbis did not hesitate to adopt the practice of using the planetary rulers for the hours and days, which was a common heritage of the Greco-Roman oikumene. This cultural adoption gave rise to the application by the rabbis of certain astrological techniques for some aspects of mundane astrology (bEr 56a), which were also transposed to the casting of primitive horoscopes (bShab 156a–b) and the fixing of the correct day for blood-letting (bShab 129b). In other words, through the halakhic practice of calendar rec-koning by the planets, the outcasts of the Second Temple period tacitly passed over in the earlier sources, found entrance into the cultural world of the rabbis, and with them a halakhically legitimate practice of astrology came into being. “Jewish astrology” in later centuriesThe interwoven development of calendar reckoning and the adoption of astrological practices had great repercussions in later Jewish his-tory. Numerous sources provide evidence that mainly the astrological techniques related to the calculation of tequfot and the planetary rulers gained a place of honor in later Jewish cultural history. Legitimized through the role in calendar calculations, it is no surprise that the system of planetary rulers found its way also into numerous literary works of the later layers of rabbinic literature.37 On the theoretical level, the system of planetary rulers was widely accepted in Jewish sources. It was known, for example, to the author of the Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliʿezer, who deals with it extensively in chapters 6–8 of his work,38 and it is described in detail in a few passages trans-mitted in the context of the so-called Barayta di-Shemuʾel.39 Shabbetai ליה דקיימא משום—לא טעמא מאי בשבתא בתלתא .כאחד שוין מטה ושל מעלה של ה׳ פתאים שומר—רבים ביה דדשו כיון .בזווי קיימא נמי שבתא מעלי .בזווי מאדים. 37 For a useful collection of many relevant texts cf.

Accordingly, it does not come as a total surprise that this theory can also be found in a 12th-century Ashkenazi Bible commentator like Bekhor Shor, who uses the completion of the weekly cycle of the planetary rulers as an explanation to an inherent interpretative difficulty in the verse Gen 2:2, which claims that God completed the creation on the seventh day, although He must have rested on Sabbath.42 Later on, Eleʿazar of Worms provides lengthy texts on the system of the planetary rulers borrowed from Shabbetai Donnolo in his own commentary on the Sefer Yezirah,43 which in turn were identified as Eleʿazar’s own words in a commentary of the 13th-century writer Abraham ben Azriel in his book ‘Arugat ha-Bosem.44As we have observed above, the calculation of the tequfot was closely linked with the adoption of the system of planetary rulers of the days, the hours and astrological practices from the very beginning. After all, it was none other than Mar Shemuel, who had stated that “There is no tequfah of Nisan which falls in (the hour of ) Jupiter and does not fell the trees, and there is no tequfah of Tevet, which falls in (the hour of ) Jupiter and does not dry the seeds” (bEr 56a).

Since it is attested in early fragments from the Cairo Genizah and was written in Palestinian Ara-maic, it probably stems from Palestine in the late Byzantine or early Islamic period.46Specifically based on the system of planetary rulers is a small astro-logical work providing short predictions for the beginning of actions (katarchai) and simple horoscopes for the children born in every sin-gle planetary hour of the week. This text was extremely popular in the Jewish Middle Ages. It is preserved in at least two manuscripts from the Cairo Genizah (one in Babylonian Aramaic, the other one in Hebrew), and numerous medieval European manuscripts.47 The text often bears the title Shimmush HaNKaL ShaZaM, and was also incorporated at the end of the manuscripts and the printed edition of Ele‘azar of Worms’s commentary on the Sefer Yezirah48 and in the Sefer Gematriot attributed to Judah he-Hasid.49One of the most prolific fields of “Jewish astrology,” however, was prognostications for the tequfot, which can be found in calendar hand-books, liturgical manuscripts and mystical treatises. Only examples of these texts can be mentioned here. An important early example of calendar handbooks with astrological appendices is the manuscript Or. Oct. 352 (Steinschneider 221) of the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin. It was presumably written around 1300 and bears the title Sod ha-‘Ibbur. Two and a half folios at the end of this handbook contain astrological prognostications, most of them referring to the tequfot (and moladot)50 Tequfah: The History of an Idea” (Heb.), Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Folklore 17 (1995): 21–32, on pp. 21–22 (with references to earlier studies).

An early example of this is the manuscript Sassoon 535 (now Klagsbald), which preserves one of the earliest testimonies for the Mahzor Vitry. It was written in France in the middle of the 12th century, but contains on pp. 451–453 two short astrological texts on the moladot and the planets added by a slightly later hand.53 Later on, we can encounter much more elaborate collections of cognate texts in the Italian Sefer ha-Tadir written by Moshe ben Yequtiel de Rossi (1380).54 Presum-ably via Italy such appendices reached Yemen in the 17th century, where astrological tequfot- and moladot prognostications based on the system of planetary rulers can be found regularly in liturgical manu-scripts, too.55Finally, astrological texts on the planets and the tequfot also found their way into medieval Jewish esoteric works such as Ele‘azar of Worms’s Sode Razzaya, although generally speaking these works themselves display a slightly more developed knowledge of planetary astronomy and astrology than the former traditions.56Planetary astrology thus became an inseparable part of traditional Jewish learning in the Middle Ages. Little can be said about the exact date and origin of each of these medieval samples of astrology. One might assume that some of them might well be much older than their first attestation in medieval manuscripts, but this remains guesswork. At any rate, there can be no doubt that the enormous popularity of tequfot-astrology closely associated with the system of planetary rulers of the days and the hours, which can be observed in medieval Judaism, finds its ideological and pragmatic justification nowhere else than in the Talmudic tradition itself.

On the one hand, the information conveyed by it was per-ceived as valuable and credible. On the other hand, this knowledge often happened to be bizarre or vague and thus hard to uncover and understand.

In Antiquity dream inquiries were usually performed in the temples, the place where the human and the divine realms met and mingled.6 However, if one is to judge on the basis of biblical evidence, it seems that this kind of practice was not widespread among the Israelites. Except for the case of King Solomon to whom God appeared in a dream after the king had sacrificed a thousand burnt-offerings at Gibeon “for that was the great high place,” apparently a dream-incubation episode, the Bible does not relate cases of dream inquiries in places of worship.7That is not surprising given the biblical view of prophecy, namely, the explicit word of God delivered to man as the major and almost sole legitimate means of divination. This stance lies behind the inner contradiction in the biblical approach to dreams that moves between admiration and consent, on the one hand, and disdain and rejection on 6 This practice, known as dream-incubation, is attested to in Mesopotamian, Egyp-tian and Greco-Roman sources. See R. Fidler, Dreams Speak Falsely?

Jeffers, Magic and Divination in Ancient Palestine and Syria (Leiden, 1996), pp. 134–39. Some twenty-five years of ongoing incubation dreams in Asclepius’ temple in Pergamon (144–171 CE) are broadly attested in Aelius Aristides’ Sacred Tales. See C. A. Behr, Aelius Aristides and the Sacred Tales (Chicago, 1968). 7 1 Kings 3:3ff; 2 Chron. 1:3ff. For a comprehensive discussion of this episode see Fidler, Dream Theophanies, pp. 252–81. The revelation of God to Samuel at Shiloh (1 Sam. 3:1ff.) might also be—and has sometimes been—considered as a close case. However, in spite of its taking place during the nighttime (or toward morning) at the House of God, not only is it not explicitly associated with a dream, some of its details actually undermine the possibility of its being a dream revelation. Moreover, it seems that the emphasis on Samuel’s naiveté and the lack of any ritual preparations on his side, in contrast to God’s initiative recurring time after time, is actually aimed at disas-sociating the scene from the (probably well known) case of dream-incubation. For the debate over the cultural meaning of the episode, see Gnuse, The Dream Theophany, pp. 149–52; Fidler, ibid., pp. 288–99; Jeffers, Magic and Divination, p. 138; V.

Jacob’s dream at Beth-el has also been observed as relating to the practice of dream-incubation. Though no initiation, let alone any ritual practice, is mentioned on Jacob’s part, etio-logically understood the story might recount the roots of dream-incubation practice that was customary at Beth-el temple. See Fidler, ibid., pp. 152–87 (esp. 166 and notes 185–87); R. Kutscher, “The Mesopotamian God Zaqar and Jacob’s Massebah,” Be’er-Sheva 3 (1988), pp. 125–30 (Heb.). Robert Gnuse suggests that the episode of Jaddus’ dream told by Josephus (Ant 11:326–328), was actually a case of incubation narrated in the cautious way typical of the Bible concerning this kind of divination. See R. Gnuse, “The Temple Experience of Jaddus in the Antiquities of Josephus: A Report of Jewish Dream Incubation,” JQR 83 (1993): 349–68. It is possible that also Philo’s notion of Jacob’s dream already involved incubation.

The theo-phany dream was approved as part of the general belief in God’s reve-lation to man. The riddle dream was rejected in favor of prophecy. Its mantic interpretation was perceived among other divinatory practices as part of the ways of the nations, prohibited for Israel, even though it was not so decisively condemned as they were. Dreams mentioned in the Bible are thus mostly of the theophany type, where God’s message is delivered clearly and not through riddles or symbols. If the pheno-menon of interpreting riddle dreams did gain popularity among the Israelites in biblical times, it went, however, almost unrecorded.9 The rabbinic view of dreams is also not homogenous.10 Polyphonic in its very essence, their literature provides a stage for different, even 8 Compare for example Gen. 20:6 or Num. 12:6 (for the approving attitude) with Jer. 29:8, Zech. 10:2, or Eccles. 5:6. For the parallel between “a prophet” (נביא) and “a dreamer of dreams” (חלום חלם) as carriers of a (false) heavenly message, see Deut. 13:2–6. 9 The most famous example for that kind of practice in the Bible is, of course, the case of Joseph, who began as an annoying interpreter of his own dreams and reached the pinnacle as a most celebrated interpreter at Pharaoh’s court (Gen. 37–42).

Thus, on the one hand, it comprises clear manifestations of the belief in the validity of dreams and in their power to affect the lives of the dreamer and even of those people he or she dreams about. Examples are the saying that “a dream is one-sixtieth of prophecy” (bBer 57b); Rabba’s desire to attain the solution of an unsolved halakhic dilemma in a dream (bMen 67b); and the ritual practices for reversing a bad dream (hatavat ḥalom).11 On the other hand, we hear that “the words of dreams have no effect,”12 or that “one only shows a person [in his dream] his own ponderings.”13 In between is the approach that “all dreams follow the mouth”—that is to say, that they are fulfilled in accordance with their interpretation.14 By declaring that, the rabbis shifted the core of the connection between the dream and reality from the dreamer and his symbolic dreamed vision to that of the interpreter. The power to foretell reality and to affect it is thus removed from the dream and its message and handed over to the per-son (preferably a rabbi) who effects it through the very act of declaring its interpretation.It is no wonder, then, that the Sages’ literature includes traditions concerning dream interpretation as well as practices for initiated drea-ming. The former is attested to mainly in the talmudic “dream book” and the partial, earlier parallels in Midrash Rabba on Lamentations.15 Dreaming techniques, which bring us closer to our subject, are evi-denced in the Tosefta.Practices of Dream InquiryExplicit rabbinic evidence concerning dreaming practices is extremely rare.

Some professional manifestations of the technique are recorded in the Greek magical papyri.20 Jewish evidence of such prescriptions is 16 On the rabbinic category “the ways of the Amorites” see Harari, “The Sages,” pp. 528–9 (and n. 28 for further bibliography); G.

Haim Weiss suggested a semiotic interpretation in which the exposing of the hidden side of the garment symbolizes the dreamer’s wish that knowl-edge, hidden throughout the day (the time when the garment is worn properly), will be exposed at night. See Weiss, The Role of Dreams, pp. 37–38. 18 Two sequential and parallel stories in the Babylonian Talmud (MK 28a) tell about the revelation of the deceased in their brother’s or student’s dream, in fulfillment of the latter’s request, expressed before the former’s death. The fact that it was a dream revelation is explicitly attested in mss. Oxford 366, Munich 140, Vatican 108. In all the other manuscripts, including Munich 95 and Vatican 104, as well as in the printed version, the word בחלמא (in a dream) is missing. However, there is little doubt that this is indeed the meaning of the text. 19 This phrasing is by no means a definition of magic, though it might be useful for our purpose here.

Actually, we have no “professional” prescriptions for receiving a dream revelation prior to the mystical-magical treatises of the Hekhalot and Merkavah literature.21 Broad, detailed instructions for inducing an angel to appear in one’s dream are found in a text known as the adjuration of the Prince of Dream. Here is a portion of it:22 Thus do: fast for three days and say {to me}23 these (scriptural) verses on each and every night and sleep in your clothes. And on the third night take the book in your hand and say these names three times with the verses and afterwards lie on your shoulders for immediately a figure of a man will come to you and will speak to you (about) everything you may ask him, both great and small matters24 [. . .] And this is what you should say: Blessed are you, our God, king of the world, God the great, mighty, awesome, exalted, wonderful king, who answers at all time of trouble [. . . here come 12 verses from Psalms]25 ography (1928–1994),” ANRW II 18.5 (1995): 3412–20.

Though most of the Hekhalot and Merkavah texts are found in medieval manu-scripts of the Ashkenazi pietists (along with a small portion of fragments in the Cairo Genizah), they no doubt derive from earlier mystical traditions. It is widely accepted that the cultural attitude recorded in these texts developed mainly, but not exclusively, in Palestine during the third to eighth centuries of our era. There is no reason to assume that the quoted text exceeds these lines.22 See the full text in P. Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tübingen, 1981), §§ 502–507. For an English translation, see Lesses, Ritual Practices, pp. 395–99. See also Rebecca Lesses’ discussion on this and other related texts of adjuration for dream requests and the translation of some of the texts on pp. 230–54, 395–411. I generally follow her translation with some necessary changes.23 The word לי (to me) does not fit in the context of the adjuration and seems to be superfluous. Nowhere else in the texts is it mentioned that the instructions are given by the angel (or by God). They are always delivered in a neutral manner: “and say these names,” “and this is what you should say,” “these verses he should say,” “on the third [night] he should say,” etc. 24 The Hebrew קטן דבר עם גדול דבר מן is grammatically incorrect.

As we all know, knowledge is power and the mastering of concea-led knowledge is even more so. One can easily detect this from the self-image of yordei ha-merkavah (the “descendants” to the chariot) presented at the opening of Hekhalot Rabbati from the mouth of R. Yishma’el, though with no precise connection to the adjuration of the Prince of Dream.37 As we shall see later it carries not only social advantages (emphasized by R. Yishma’el), but also financial ones.The old weapon in political-theological struggles, accusations of sor-cery (כשפים), also played a role in the anti-Rabbanite argumentation of the Karaites around the turn of the first millennium. Daniel Al-Qumisi, Salmon ben Yeruhim and other Karaite theologists accused the Rabbanites of writing amulets and of using both pure and impure names for various kinds of sorcery.38 In a fragment of a tractate written 35 On the genre of magical prayers see P.

Dream inquiries were undoubtedly performed by Jews at that time as manifested in the famous correspon-dence between R. Hai Gaon and the rabbis of Kairouan. In the early eleventh century R. Hai Gaon wrote a long, detailed responsum to the rabbis of Kairouan (today in Tunisia) concerning various matters of wonder that they had asked him about. Both their ponderings (mentioned by R. Hai) and his reply focus on the power of the Ineffable Name and the possibility of putting it into effect.40 It is clear from R. Hai’s words that this is not the first time he had replied to them about these matters. Apparently unsatisfied with his first res-ponse, the rabbis of Kairouan emphasized in their second letter the reliability of the evidence underlying their inquiry. And they wrote the following about dream inquiry:41And also concerning [practices of] dream inquiry—there are (were)42 some wise and pious old men among us who knew them. And they used to fast for some days not eating meat and not drinking wine and sleeping in a pure place, and praying and saying (certain) known ver-ses and letters in numbers,43 and (then) to sleep. And they used to see wonderful dreams, like prophecy. And there were some of them who lived in our days and whom we knew. Each one of them had a (certain) known figure—one (had) an old man and the other (had) a youth—who would appear in it [i.e. the dream] and tell him and say verses to him that convey the certain matter he had asked about.Mizrahi Jewry 2 (2007): 79–101 (on pp. 84–7) (digital only: http://sephardic.fiu.edu/journal/november07/YuvalHarari.pdf ).39 J.

Moshe Idel assumed that these words (Heb. במספרים אותיות) refer to Ex. 14:19–21. Each of these verses comprises 72 letters and a certain combination of them constructs the famous Name of 72 Letters. This name is first mentioned and described by Rashi (on Suk. 45a) almost a century later. See M.

Hai’s responsum attests that the very practice of dream inquiry was also known in his surroundings (Pumbedita, Babylonia). Yet, he was very skeptical about the figure that appears in the dream:And you mentioned [the matter of] dream inquiry in your query and that there are people among you who inquire and see prophecy-like [visions], and this is also far [from being admitted or approved]. And we have heard that also here there were people who used to see true answers to what they had inquired (about),44 but now we have only seen those who require signs like [the appearance in a dream of ] rabbis in case that would happen, or [the appearance in a dream of ] non-Jews in case that would happen, and [also] (biblical) verses relating the required matter. And there are (indeed) some people whose dreams are more definite and clear when they set a dream inquiry than other’s dreams, and sometimes the answer is clear and sometimes it is obscure and sometimes there is no answer at all, but fear falls upon the inquirer. [. . .] But this [matter] that you mentioned (that) each of them [i.e. those who practiced dream inquiry] (had) a certain figure, a master of the dream (החלום בעל), who would come to him, an old man to one and a youth to the other, we have heard that such (things) happened, but we have not seen it nor has anyone told us that he had seen it. And we have seen versions [of prescriptions] in which it is mentioned [i.e. the appearance of the master of the dream] and people (even) said before us that they had tried them once and twice but they did not work for them.4544 The Heb. singular in ששואל למה מוכיחות תשובות שרואה מי. . .רואה ששואל מי indicates the existence of the phenomenon and not a certain person. Emanuel fol-lowed Heschel in taking the words of R. Mazliah, son of Al-Bazak about the revela-tion of R. Saadia Gaon in R. Hai’s dream as evidencing that “even R. Hai himself experienced things alike [i.e. true answers in the dream to pre-set questions].” See ibid., n. 117; A. J. Heschel, “On the Holy Spirit in the Middle Ages (up to Maimo-nides’ Time),” in Alexander Marx Jubilee Volume on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday, ed. S. Lieberman (New York, 1950), Hebrew section, pp. 175–208, on p. 204 n. 168. The article was recently published in English in idem, Prophetic Inspiration after the Prophets: Maimonides and other Medieval Authorities, edited by M. M. Fai-erstein (Hoboken, 1996). See p. 59, n. 171. Interestingly enough, Abraham Heschel on the one hand considers the traditions about dream queries among the geonim to be “legend,” whereas on the other hand, he asserts, “In these statements R. Hai Gaon hints at the fact that he too was occupied with adducing answers through divinatory dreams. He merely denies that he actually saw the dream-master” (ibid). I believe that we should indeed treat all these late traditions as legendary. Accordingly, unless we can historically reinforce the tradition about R. Hai, written in Sicily by one of his students (through the mediation of words by Moses son of Jacob Ibn Ezra written in Spain about a hundred years later), I suggest considering it evidence of R. Hai’s image among his disciples rather than indicating biographical fact(s).45 Ibid., pp. 137–38."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"300  yuval  harariR. Hai distinguished between two branches of the practice. One strove for information through dreamed signs and biblical verses. The other aspired for a clear, explicit message from the mouth of a dreamed entity. The difference between them lay in the figure of the mediator between the heavenly message and man. In the first case the heavenly message was sent directly into the dream, in a coded form. No hea-venly mediator was involved but then a human interpreter was needed, either the dreamer or someone else, in order to turn the message into a meaningful one. Conversely, no human intervention was required in the second case, since the message was delivered explicitly and clearly from the mouth of the heavenly mediator who appeared in the dream. As we can see, R. Hai Gaon admitted that a dream revelation without a figure was a source of true knowledge; but he was very skeptical about the one with a “figure.” Even though he was personally familiar with the theoretical aspect of “the master of Dream” praxis, he found no reason to believe in its efficacy. About two centuries later, in the time and place from which the Cairo Genizah emerged, Maimonides raised his own voice against practices of dream inquiry. Nevertheless, it was not inquiry through an angelic mediator that upset him, but one made through the deceased, as one can see from his discussion on Laws of Idolatry in his Mishne Torah:What is a necromancer?—One who starves himself and goes and sleeps in a cemetery in order that a deceased will come to him in a dream and will tell him about matters inquired by him. And there are still others who put on certain clothes and utter [certain] words and offer a certain incense and sleep alone so that a particular dead person will come and converse with them46 in a dream.47 The revelation of an angel in a dream is discussed at length in The Guide of the Perplexed, where in and of itself it raises no problem. On the contrary, given the fulfillment of certain preconditions, Maimo-nides perceives this to be a high stage of prophecy. To be sure, this is the sole case of true prophetic revelation of an angel. Any other 46 Lit. with him.47 Moses Maimonides, Mishne Torah—The Book of Knowledge, ed. and trans. by M. Haymson (Jerusalem, 1962), pp. 79b–80a."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" metatron and the treasure of gold 301kind of angelic vision, whether in wakefulness or in a dream, is simply impossible.48 Even though Maimonides did not relate explicitly to the practice of dream inquiry, his denouncement and ridicule of magic in general and the belief in the performative power of words in particular, together with his view of angelic revelation, apparently left no room for even the slightest tolerance toward the idea or the practice of inducing an angel to appear in one’s dream and speak to him.49 48 Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, translated with an Introduction and notes by Shlomo Pines (Chicago, 1963), II, 42 (pp. 388–90). Cf. Maimonides’ discussion on dreams and prophecy, ibid., II 41–46 (pp. 385–407).49 On Maimonides’ attitude toward magic, see Harari, “The Debate,” pp. 90–101 and bibliography. A totally different approach towards the efficacy of dream inquiries and the authority of their outcome was adopted at almost the same time by R. Jacob of Mervege. His unique response, widely referred to in later halakhic literature, was com-piled at the very beginning of the 13th century on the basis of a long series of dream inquiries posed by him. See Margalioth, She’elot u-teshuvot. Cf. I. Ta-Shma, “She’elot u-teshuvot min ha-shamayim,” Tarbiz 57 (1987), pp. 51–66 (Heb.); N. Danzig, “Geonic Responsa Sha’arei Teshuvah and She’elot U-Teshuvot Min Ha-Shamayim,” Tarbiz 58 (1988): 21–48 (Heb.). For more general perspectives on the subject, see Heschel, Pro-phetic Inspiration, pp. 1–67; E. E. Urbach, “Halakha and Prophecy,” Tarbiz 18 (1946): 1–27 (Heb.); Idel, Nocturnal Kabbalists. Medieval Europe is outside the scope of this paper, as are also “eastern” famous dreamers such as R. Yosef Taitazak, R. Yosef Karo, or R. Hayim Vital. See G. Scholem, “The Magid of R. Yosef Taitazak and the rev-elations attributed to him,” Sefunot 11 (1971): 69–112 (Heb.); R. J. C. Werblowsky, R. Joseph Karo, Lawyer and Mystic (Philadelphia, 1977); M. M. Faierstein, Jewish Mys-tical Autobiographies: Book of Visions and Book of Secrets (New York, 1999). However, two brief comments concerning R. Jacob’s praxis are feasible: (a) He always addresses God and asks Him to order the angels to appear in his dream and give him the desired answer (for example, Margalioth, She’elot u-teshuvot, §§ 3, 5, 47, pp. 47, 52, 72). God is perceived as the unique source of both the heavenly knowledge and the uncovering of it. The angels—and not a specific one of them!—are nothing but informants (§§ 5, 12, pp. 51, 57). Textual characteristics of adjuration (Harari, “Magical Text,” pp. 116–21) are absolutely missing. This fits well with the answer R. Jacob receives upon inquiring about the use of the 42-letter Name for the adjuring of angels: “Holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts [Is. 6:3] and he alone will take care of all your needs” (§ 7, pp. 53–54). (b) R. Jacob was not a blind follower of his dreams. He was familiar with the talmu-dic concern about the possible demonic origin of dreams and in certain matters he requested a repeat answer in order to be sure. In one case he turned to God a third time with an explicit inquiry concerning the reliability of the messages of the previous nights: “Whether [the dreamed words] came into my mouth from God or not [. . .] whether the words were inspired by the holy spirit and thus are useful [. . .] or they came onto my mouth from another spirit and they are not useful and it is better for me to hide and conceal them.” (§ 5, p. 52). The answer to these questions was expected in yet another dream revelation and thus what we are actually dealing with here is a kind of (contextually absurd) ars poetica of dream inquiry in which the practice is applied in order to inquire about its own reliability. Cf. the closely similar but dif-ferent matter in § 22, pp. 61–62). On later, Kabbalistic developments of the practice of dream inquiry and their theological meaning, see M. Idel, Nocturnal Kabbalists."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"302  yuval  harariAs always, highly intellectual views make little impression on the common man.

From expelling crickets out of the house to exorcising demons out of the body, from support of labor to release from jail, from kindling love to the destruction of a rival, from the cure of hemorrhoids to the study of the Torah—magic had to do with everything.54 Economic success was not exceptional.55 Ancient books of magic recipes like Sefer Harazim (the Book of the Mysteries) or Ḥarba de-Moshe (the Sword of Moses)56 provide relatively early evi-dence of economically oriented practices of magic, whereas a rare example among the huge corpus of Aramaic incantation bowls writ-ten in Babylonia in the fifth to the seventh centuries CE,57 attests to 53 The earliest magical fragments in the Cairo Genizah are from the 10th century and a large amount of them stem from the following three decades.

Beside these somewhat trivial yet realistic goals, a few other opportunities can be detected: to “turn the heart of a prominent or rich woman towards you”; to “make horses run with all their power [so] they will not fail in their run and will be light as wind and no animal will precede them [. . .] and no [evil] sorcery or witchcraft will harm them” and thus win a chariot race; to turn “simple, worthless stones” into silver and gold; or simply “to become rich.”60 However, we take special interest in yet another type of option—the discovery of a treasure.61Institute Pamphlet 2 (University of Southampton, 2002); Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic, pp. 183–93; Harari, Early Jewish Magic, pp. 182–96. 58 See D. Levene and S. Bhayro, “ ‘Bring to the Gates . . . upon a Good Smell and upon Good Fragrances’: An Aramaic Incantation Bowl for Success in Business,” Archiv für Orientforschung 51 (2005–6): 242–46. Almost all the incantation bowls were produced with the aim of protecting client(s) from demonic or sorcerers’ attacks or of expelling evil sorceries and spirits from a client’s body or house that they had already invaded. 59 These cases show, on the one hand, that the writing of amulets actually relied upon the professional literature, and on the other, that it left the writer some space for personal improvisation. See M. D. Swartz, “Scribal Magic and its Rhetoric: For-mal Patterns in Medieval Hebrew and Aramaic Incantation Texts from the Cairo Genizah,” HTR 83 (1990): 160–80; Harari, “Economic Aspects,” pp. 32–33. 60 See Harari, “Economic Aspects.”61 The idea appears in the famous legend of Solomon and Asmodeus in the Baby-lonian Talmud (Git 68b). It is told that on his way to Jerusalem, Asmodeus laughed when he saw a magician performing his magic. When he was asked why he laughed, he replied: “[It was] because he was sitting above the king’s treasure [buried in the ground]. Let him bewitch (לקסום) that which is beneath him [and gain it].” One pos-sible interpretation is that Asmodeus mocks the magician for being busy with all kinds of (effective) magical acts instead of turning his power toward something really big. This reading suggests that it is the blindness of the magician which is at stake. This motif is in line with the one that characterizes the whole story. See H. Schwarzbaum, “The Shortsightedness of the Angel of Death,” in Roots and Landscapes, ed. E. Yassif (Beer Sheva, 1993), pp. 56–73 (Heb.). I prefer this over the other possible reading, according to which the magician was performing a hocus-pocus show in order to obtain some money from his spectators and Asmodeus laughed at his very capability to perform anything real."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":" metatron and the treasure of gold 305Only very few of the prescriptions in the Genizah material known to me were designated for that purpose.62 A relatively early one of them (eleventh century), which relates to the case of a known hidden treasure, suggests the practice of divination through a drunk cock:A section [i.e., recipe] for buried money whose place of concealment is known to no one. He [i.e., the client] should take a white cock and you [i.e., the magician] should let it drink old wine for seven days and then write [the following] on a plate and hang it on its right wing. And at the place it goes [to] he should dig, [for] there it is buried. And this is what you should write: In the name of MYK’L GBRY’L RF’L ZWRY’L ḤMRY’L QDWŠY’L MDBNY’L MDNY’L and KMŠY’L63 BRQY’L MWG’L MR’WT YH YH ’’’S [Amen Amen Amen Selah].64Two other options are proposed in another, much later fragment.65 One is based on divination through a child.66 The other, “tested and efficient,”67 requires the use of a candle made of “virgin wax,” sulfur, a finger bone from a human corpse, another uncertain ingredient, and a thread taken out of a rope that was used for an execution. In times where no secured cellars for safes were available, people had to hide their money somewhere. Thus, concealed treasures were apparently known to exist. But where? Relatives of a deceased person, who died without telling them the secret, greedy neighbors and mere 62 That is not surprising in light of the realistic, pragmatic character of the pro-fessional literature of magic. In contrast to the imaginary potency of magic in folk narratives and fantastic literature, most of the magical recipes suggest assistance in achieving goals that in principle can be attained without that aid. The main excep-tion is the demonical sphere, which kept the sorcerers very busy and could not be approached except through magical means.63 The word וכמשיאל can also be read as a name—WKMŠY’L.64 Schäfer and Shaked, Magische Texte, III, p. 56 (20a:2–10).65 Ibid., pp. 92–93 (2a:9–3a:4)—a 16th-century manuscript. 66 On child divination in the Babylonian Talmud, see Harari, “The Sages,” p. 546. On the use of this practice in the Greco-Roman world, see S. I. Johnston, “Charming Children: The Use of the Child in Ancient Divination,” Arethusa 34 (2001): 97–117. For a psychological perspective on the practice in medieval Judaism, see Y. Bilu, “Pon-dering ‘the Princes of the Oil’—A New Light on an Old Phenomenon,” Journal of Anthropological Research 37 (1981): 269–78. 67 In this context the Hebrew ומנוסה בחון should be understood as “tested and efficient” rather then “tested and examined.” This is clear from prescriptions where מנוסה appears in a way that excludes the meaning “examined.” For example, MS New York Public Library 190 pp. 82–83, §§ 33, 36: “and this name if efficient for every good thing”; “the power of this name is efficient for everything” (;טובה לכל מנוסה השם וזה מנוסה דבר לכל כוחו השם זה). Idioms testifying to the empirically proven efficiency of a recipe are widespread in the magical literature.

Ṣedaqah, son of Sitt al-Ahl, used the one of dream inquiry. If Ṣedaqah himself was not a practitioner of magic, he probably turned to someone who was in order to be directed toward his desi-red aim—the uncovering of a treasure of gold coins. As we have seen above, the professional knowledge possessed by such a person com-prised various options for the exploring of treasures. However, there was always the old familiar way of summoning an angel and directly asking him about it. The preparations required for the revelation were usually a combination of certain ritual behavior with the recitation of an incantation. In some cases, such as the following recipe from the Cairo Genizah (eleventh century), the writing of the incantation was required, too:69Dream inquiry, tested and efficient.70 Purify yourself three days and fast every day [during these] three days and wear pure, clean, washed clo-thes.

I call you Michael the great prince to come to me and show me everything I ask you this night truly. And fast and do not eat and do not drink two days 68 Regarding the first category see the stories in the Babylonian Talmud (Ber 18b) about Ze’iri and Shemu’el who went to the cemetery (on different occasions), called certain deceased persons and asked them about some money they had hidden which could not be found. In both cases the deceased told them where the money was and indeed they found it. See also the story about the man who was informed in a riddle dream of the place where his father’s money had been hidden (bBer 56b; yMS 4:12; Midrash Bereshit Rabba 68:12 [Theodor-Albeck, II, pp. 784–5]; Midrash Eicha Rabba 1 [Buber, pp. 27b–28a]) and the discussion in G. Hasan-Rokem, “An Almost Invisible Presence: Multilingual Puns in Rabbinic Literature,” in The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud and Rabbinic Literature, eds. C. E. Fonrobert and M. S. Jaffee (Cambridge, 2007), pp. 222–39. 69 Schäfer and Shaked, Magische Texte, I, p. 136 (1a:11–1b:7).70 This idiom and parallels are used abundantly by the author of the book of recipes quoted here.

It is only in cases like the one described below, also found in the Genizah (in a relatively late manuscript—sixteenth century), that material evidence could have survived to our day:78To uncover a finding. Write on deer hide: I adjure you Sandalphon Gabriel Hadatiel in the name of YHVY ŠDY N’ holy I am who I am to come to me this night and show me a great finding that I shall be very happy with and tell me where is that finding truly. And put the writing under your head and lie down and sleep and they will tell you. End. This was indeed the case of Ṣedaqah, son of Sitt al-Ahl, who probably lived in Cairo during the eleventh century.79 And because of the cer-tain practice he carried out that required the writing of the adjuration on a durable material (and some luck), we have at hand this unique example of an actual implementation of dream inquiry. It seems that Ṣedaqah knew about a certain treasure of gold coins that was hidden somewhere in his vicinity, but he had no idea where it was. He decided to pose a dream inquiry and to induce Metatron, the most notable angel in the heavenly hierarchy, to disclose this secret to him. In line with our type of testimony—the very written adjura-tion used by Ṣedaqah—nothing is known about the enveloping ritual. However, we can quite confidently speculate about what happened before that special night, relying on other instructive literature we have encountered. 76 Heb. אחד ולילה ימים מב. Peter Schäfer and Shaul Shaked read it literally: forty-two days and one night (ibid., p. 140, 1b:6), but this is quite uncertain. They referred to other cases of such a long fast but also suggested the option of a corruption of ב ימים—two days. Perceiving the text as practical I believe that this indeed is the case and that the recipe suggests a realistic fast for the two days and the night in between, which anticipate the night of the dream inquiry. 77 In an adjacent prescription also aimed at a dream revelation, it is also demanded to “keep away from a house in which a woman stays.” See ibid., p. 136 (1b:8–16). No specific angel is adjured in this case, but some unnamed ones. The result however is the same: “And you will see a wonder for they will come and speak to you [concern-ing] your desire and request.” 78 Schäfer and Shaked, Magische Texte, III, p. 369 (2a:9–13).79 The amulet prepared for Ṣedaqah (or by himself) is written in a non professional semi-cursive eastern (mizrahi) script, which is typical of that period. I would like to thank Dr. Edna Angel from the Department of Manuscripts and the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts at the Jewish National and University Library for this information."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"308  yuval  harariṢedaqah probably fasted during the whole day, maybe even the day before, and might even have abstained from drinking water. He most likely went through some kind of purification, avoiding dirt and apparently also close contact with women. He almost certainly washed himself and put on clean clothing. Concentrating on his desire, he possibly prayed throughout the day and recited incantations before he went to sleep. However, one thing is quite sure: upon getting into bed he took with him a small sheet of paper on which an adjuration was written (by him? for him?) and most likely placed it below his head. Then he closed his eyes and waited for sleep to overtake him. It would take a great deal of luck to find any evidence for the results of that night. Maybe nothing happened. Maybe he did converse with Metatron in his dream but in the morning he forgot his words. Maybe he tried it more than once. Maybe he even found the treasure—who knows? However, when everything was over he had to take care of that small sheet of paper. Throwing it away did not even occur to him as it bore holy names of God. So he went to the synagogue and put it there among all kinds of old documents and torn and worn-out writings that no one needed any more.80 And this is what was written on it:81Recto1 In the name of YHVH we shall ונצלח נעשה יהוה בשם do and succeed822 by (the word of ) YHVH83 may the prince שר אלי יבא יהוה עלפי80 This is, of course, just one possible, imagined illustration. 81 The suggested reading is based on an examination of new photographs of the manuscript. I would like to express my gratitude to the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution, for both supplying the reproduction and granting permission to publish it in this article. Both my reading and understand-ing of the text diverge from those of Gottheil and Worell who misread the entire text. I would like to thank Shaul Shaked, Gidi Bohak, Reimund Leicht, Edna Angel, and especially Uri Melammed for their remarks, which improved my reading. 82 The left-hand stroke of the ח in ונצלח is missing due to the cutting of the paper strip after the spell had been written. The (expected) letter י might have been added between the letters ל and ח (resulting in the broad right-hand stroke of the ח), after the word had been written. The phrase ונצליח נעשה יהוה בשם opens many incanta-tions. It is also known to appear in Jewish spells in its initials form—בינו. The earliest occurrence known to me is an amulet found in the ruin of an ancient synagogue in Ḥorvat Marish (in a layer dated to the first half of the 7th century). See Naveh and Shaked, Magic Spells, pp. 43–50 (and note on line 1).83 The idiom יהוה פי על (by the word/command of God) is frequent in the Bible (e.g., Ex. 17:1; Num. 3:16, 39, 51; Deut. 34:5)."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":" metatron and the treasure of gold 309 3 of princes come to me, Oh84 Metatron85 מיטטרון אך השרים 4 Oh, he is beloved and dear וחביב אהוב הוא אך 5 over all the dwellers of height,86 נאמן עבד מרומו פני מכל a faithful servant 6 of God of Israel, high87 priest, גודל כהן ישראל לאלהי 7 head of the priests.88 You have89 לך שיש הכוהנים ראש 8 seventy names, you are90 שאתה שימות שבעים 9 appointed over the great princes הגדולים השרים על הממונה10 and you are the head of the המחנות ראש ואתה (heavenly) camps11 I adjure you91 in the name of YHVH יהוה בשם עוליך אני משביע12 Sabaoth, God of Israel who is יושב ישראל אלוהי צבאות enthroned among84 I read the two אך as a kind of vocative. אך appears (rarely) in sequences of nomina barbara, e.g., Schäfer and Shaked, Magische Texte II, pp. 140, 172; P. Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tübingen 1981), § 566, but this does not seem to be the case here.85 Metatron is directly addressed in other adjurations from the Cairo Genizah. Paral-lels to the formula recited here are found in three other amulets from the Genizah: TS K1.168, lines 39–45 (Schiffman and Swartz, Hebrew and Aramaic Incantation Texts, pp. 145–47); TS Or. 1080.15.81, lines 104–11, TS 8.275, lines 1a/19–1b/8 (Schäfer and Shaked, Magische Texte I, pp. 164, 173). See below. See also Metatron’s adjuration to cut down all enemies—Schäfer and Shaked, ibid., p. 129 (an amulet), and for “opening of the heart,” i.e. improvement of learning and good memory—Naveh and Shaked, Magic Spells, p. 162. For other occurrences of Metatron in Genizah adjurations see, for example, Schiffman and Swartz, ibid., p. 99; Schäfer and Shaked, Magische Texte, II, pp. 33, 88, 192, 219–20, 259; III, p. 121.86 מרומו פני is a corruption of מרומו בני (dwellers of height), as evident from the three parallels to our text mentioned in the previous note. The Hebrew מרומו (meromo) is apparently a pronunciation spelling of the Aramaic מרומא (meroma). For מרומא בני see the parallel quoted below from TS Or. 1080.15.81. Cf. TS K1.168, line 40 (above n. 85). See also the discussion below on the linguistic characteristics of this amulet. Like other occurrences of the replacement of kamatz (long a) with holam (o)—e.g., גודל (recto 6, 14, 25, verso 9, 19), עוליך (recto 11, 24, verso 8. But see verso 18—עליך), שושן (recto 18), פעומים (verso 6, 12)—the spelling מרומו (meromo) probably represents a Babylonian pronunciation characteristic to the writer of the amulet. Thus, even though the words מרומו בני appear in the third parallel of our text (TS 8.275 line 1a/20—above n. 85), I prefer the reading “dwellers of height” over the translation of the written words—“dwellers of His height.”87 For the spelling גודל (cf. recto 14, 25, verso 9, 19), see the discussion below. The word גודל is highlighted by a line above it.88 The ו is attached to the right-hand stroke of the ה and looks like part of it. Notice the untypical thickness of the right-hand stroke of the ה.89 Lit., that you have (לך שיש).90 Lit., that you are (שאתה).91 Cf. the spelling עוליך on recto 24 (but see verso 18—עליך).

The ה is possible, however not typical, and the ס is not clear. מסגב is apparently a corruption of נשגב (magnificent). Though it can also be read as a mistaken spelling of the word משגב (fortress, shelter), which occurs in the Bible in relation to God—God is my/our/a poor man’s shelter (e.g., 2Sam. 22:3; Ps. 9:10, 46:8, 59:18)—the Bible never uses משגב in the adjectival manner in which it functions in the amulet according to this (problematic and thus improbable) reading. All the attributes mentioned here are widespread in the Hekha-lot and Merkavah literature in various combinations. For a close parallel to our text, in which all the attributes (including נשגב) appear, see Schäfer, Synopse, § 582. 94 The reading of the Hebrew שהוא is uncertain. If it is correct then the rest of the sentence is missing. The whole line is highlighted by a line above it. 95 The next word, ולאמי (and to my mother), which starts with a conjunctive vav, elucidates the absence of a word before it. Ṣedaqah is denoted throughout the text by singular demonstrative pronouns, one of which was no doubt omitted here by mis-take. Cf. the phrase אמי וליה לי ותראיני (and show me and my mother. Recto 19 with note 95), which probably follows the intended phrasing of this line. 96 Interestingly, Metatron is adjured to appear in the dreams of both Ṣedaqah and his mother. His mother is denoted again as אמי (my mother) two lines below (recto 19) and in her own right on recto 28—verso 1. 97 The words אמי וליה are probably a (peculiar) corruption of the correct spelling ולאמי. Even though it is hard to explain such a spelling mistake two lines below a correct occurrence of the word (recto 17), I see no better explanation of the word וליה in this context. 98 On the demonstrative pronoun preceding the subject (הלילה בזה) in Hebrew syntax under Arabic influence, see M. H. Goshen-Gottstein, Syntax and Vocabulary of Medieval Hebrew as Influenced by Arabic, revised by S. Assif and U. Melammed, (Jerusalem, 2006), pp. 155–59 (Heb.). More examples of this kind of syntax can be found below (recto 22–23, verso 7–8 and n. 106). 99 The Hebrew אלפה is probably a conjunction of פה אל—toward here. The syntax of the whole sentence is very problematic.100 The writer does not indicate the precise name in which he adjures.

Lines recto 28—verso 2 indicate that the information was disclosed by God and sent to the dreamer through Metatron.105 The plural seems to result from the reference to both Ṣedaqah and Sitt al-Ahl in the plea starting in recto 28.106 The syntax of the Hebrew במקם אשר מקם מזה איזה is very problematic. The translation makes the phrase much more legible than the original.107 I.e. the place of the gold coins shown in the dream.108 Either זה or הזה is superfluous. Death may refer here to the danger of death resulting from the very adjuration of Metatron and his revelation in the dream, or to the sleep itself.

On the fear of death during night sleep, see bBer. 60b, where it is stated that the words “lighten my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death” (Ps. 13:4) are to be recited as part of the bedtime recitation of the Shema prayer. The words to be recited on waking in the morning, which relate to God’s control over the soul (especially: “Blessed are You, God, who restores souls to dead corpses” [ibid.]), indicate the same fear.

He could have been Ṣedaqah himself or a professional charm writer whose help Ṣedaqah had sought. His spelling and punctuation (of the first two lines) indicate that his pronunciation was Babylonian.117 This is manifested foremost from the spelling of words like גודל (godel—big), פעומים (peomim—times), שושן (sosen—joy), עוליך (olekha—upon you), מחשובת (mahshovet—thoughts), that follow the vocalization of the long a (kamatz) as o. One can also discern in some of these words (מחשובת ,שושן ,גודל) probable traces of the pronunciation of o (holam) as e—the writer dropped the holam of the last syllable (but did not mark the tzerei). This, as well as the punctuation of the word על (recto 2) with segol, following the vocalization el, are also written expres-sions of Babylonian pronunciation. Two communities existed in Cairo in the eleventh century which maintained this vocalization of Hebrew: the Babylonians and the Karaites. The angelology of the amulet (paral-lel to another amulet from the Genizah; see below) and the fact that Ṣedaqah belonged to a Rabbanite community (his amulet made its way to the Genizah at Ben Ezra Synagogue) tip the scale toward the option that also the writer of the amulet belonged to that community.118Anyway, he composed a very cryptic text. His handwriting is unclear, his grammar is bad, and his syntax is meager. In one case he seems to mistake a word for a similar one, contextually meaningless.119 If one 115 The first two letters of the word עזרה are dubious and so is the meaning of the word. The first letter seems more like ס than like ע, and the ז is not typical. One might be tempted to read here סורה—come (from the root סור. See Judges 4:18; Ruth 4:1). This kind of Hebrew, however, is very far from the vulgar style in the entire amulet (and the second letter is also not a typical ו). Thus, I tend to accept Uri Melammed’s proposal that the author started a word and then changed his mind and corrected the first two letters in order to write עזרה (help). 116 The word במהירה is highlighted by a line above it.117 For the following linguistic remarks I am deeply indebted to Uri Melammed. See also the discussion on “phonetic pronunciation” in the Babylonian magic bowls in M. Morgenstern, “On Some Non-Standard Spellings in the Aramaic Magic Bowls and Their Linguistic Significance”, Journal of Semitic Studies 52 (2007), pp. 245–77.118 The Yemenites also held this pronunciation. Theoretically it is thus possible that the amulet was written by a Yemenite who dwelled in or arrived at Cairo at that time. 119 See recto 5, where פני appears instead of בני (pnei—bnei).

In comparison to other scribes known from the Genizah his literary style is quite poor. He does not use biblical verses, let alone historiolae,120 neither does he employ a variety of nomina barbara or magical signs in the adjuration. The only hegemonic tradition repre-sented in his text is the liturgical one. Thus, one can also hardly tell whether he had a professional scribal tradition to rely on. However, he was familiar with at least some aspects of Jewish angelology including the supreme status of Metatron. This archangel, who seems to be summoned to the dream as a mes-senger of “God’s thoughts” rather than as an autonomous source of knowledge,121 is depicted not only as “the prince of princes . . . appoin-ted over the great princes . . . head of the (heavenly) camps,” but also as “high priest, head of the priests.”122 All these epithets (except for “prince of princes”) are also embedded in three other invocations of Metatron in amulets found in the Cairo Genizah. Two of them (TS Or. 1080.15.81, TS K1.168) are long and relatively beautifully written amulets, prepared by the same scribe123 more or less at the same time of our amulet (mid-eleventh century).124 In the former, Metatron is 120 On this magical genre, see D. Frankfurter, “Narrating Power: The Theory and Practice of the Magical Historiola in Ritual Spells,” in Ancient Magic and Ritual Power, eds. M. Meyer and P. Mirecki (Leiden, 1995), pp. 457–76; G. Bohak, “A Jewish Myth in Pagan Magic in Antiquity,” in Myths in Judaism: History, Thought, Literature, ed. I. Gruenwald and M. Idel (Jerusalem, 2004), pp. 97–122 (Heb.).121 Cf. above, note 49.122 As far as I am aware, this and the parallel text in TS K1.168 (below) are the only places where Metatron is referred to as a high priest or head of the priests. These epithets derive from earlier traditions about the heavenly altar and sacrifices headed by Michael “the Great Prince” (bZev 62a, bHag 12b, bMen 110a). In The Story of the Ten Martyrs, it is Metatron who is asked by R. Isma’el concerning a certain object in heaven and he explains to him that it is an altar upon which souls of the righteous are sacrificed (G. Reeg [ed.], Die Geschichte von den Zehn Martyren [Tübingen, 1985], pp. 40–41, §§ 20.1–5). Metatron does not mention himself as the one who is particu-larly in charge of heavenly sacrifice, but one might suspect that this status was also part of the features “transmitted” to him from the image of Michael. See R. Boustan, From Martyr to Mystic: Rabbinic Martyrology and the Making of Merkavah Mysticism (Tübingen, 2005), pp. 165–73. 123 This is evident from the handwriting, the organization of text and magical signs (characteres) on the long strips of paper, and the typical sign ◎ at the ends of the phrases.

All of these investigations and speculations, of course, were of no importance to Ṣedaqah, as the amulet was not written to be read and understood but to be put into action. It is not a descriptive text that we are dealing with but a performative one, a text whose “success” is 128 Peter Schäfer and Shaul Shaked read the letters ביקרתא as the first of the nomina barbara that constitute Metatron’s name.

This surprised me, as I could not see why anyone would bother to pin-prick his or her magical texts in this manner, but a few days later I was checking some of the Genizah fragments in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and discovered a most unusual magic scroll (Bodleian MS Heb. a3.31), which is made up of four unequal pieces of parchment stitched together vertically and then inscribed horizontally. I then rea-lized that the pin-pricked fragments I had seen in Cambridge had once been parts of such vertical rotuli, but the threads of the stitches that 3 For a broad survey of the magical texts from the Cairo Genizah, and much further bibliography, see Gideon Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic: A History (Cambridge: Cam-bridge University Press, 2008), pp. 215–221.4 For the place of rotuli in the history of the Jewish book, see the brief remarks of Malachi Beit-Arié, Hebrew Manuscripts of East and West [The Panizzi Lectures, 1992], (London: The British Library, 1993), pp. 10–11, and of Colette Sirat, Hebrew Manu-scripts of the Middle Ages (ed. and tr. by N. de Lange) (Cambridge: Cambridge Uni-versity Press, 2002), p. 102.

I have since continued looking for such fragments, and gradually came to realize that in some cases the rotuli disintegrated to such a degree that not only the stitches disappeared, but even the stitched pieces of parchment broke into much smaller pieces, without any pin-prick holes to set them apart from other small parchment frag-ments. I therefore try to keep track not only of all the Genizah magical fragments I can find, but also of all the parchment rotuli and rotuli-fragments, even those which have nothing to do with magic. At pre-sent, I am aware of two rotuli with magical recipes and one astrologi-cal rotulus re-used for magical recipes, of possible fragments of other magical rotuli, and of many parchment rotuli and rotuli-fragments whose contents are non-magical.6 The magical rotuli are as follows:1) Bodleian MS Heb. a3.31: A vertical parchment scroll, 92 cm long and 12 cm wide, made up of four pieces sewn together, measuring (from top to bottom) 38.5, 22.5, 17.2 and 13.8 cm, respectively. The first piece is of darkish brown color, the second is even darker, the third is a much lighter yellowish brown, and the fourth is even lighter in color. The scroll’s right margin is preserved throughout, but the left margin is fully preserved only for small parts of the lower sections of the scroll, while for the rest of the scroll it has been damaged (by fire?) in differing quantities. From the “wavy” pattern created by the missing parts when the scroll is stretched out, it seems clear that the scroll’s left margin was damaged while it was all rolled up, from bot-tom to top, which also explains why the bottom part of the scroll is much better preserved than its topmost section. It must be stressed, however, that the scroll begins and ends in medias res, and there is no telling how long the original scroll was or how much is missing on 6 For another magical fragment which may have come from a rotulus, see West-minster College Misc. 59, published as MTKG III, 74, with the editors’ note on p. 179. In what follows, I focus only on parchment rotuli, whose pieces were stitched to each other, and ignore those cases in which loose pieces of paper—including used paper—were glued one below the other and used for writing different texts (including amulets and magical recipes), a phenomenon which seems to have occurred quite often, and not only in the earlier strata of the Cairo Genizah. For published paper rotuli see, for example, MTKG II, 24 (= Bodleian Heb. a3.25); MTKG III, 66 (= T-S AS 142.15 + NS 246.14)."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"324  gideon  bohakeither end.7 Moreover, it is quite possible that more fragments of this scroll would be identified in the future, either in Oxford or in other Genizah collections.On the recto, the 145 lines of text are written in a well-trained hand, entirely uniform throughout, and clearly belonging to the ear-liest stratum of the Cairo Genizah (the hand was dated by Judith Olszowy-Schlanger to the (early) tenth century).8 The layout of the text also is remarkably uniform—each two recipes are separated by a few centimeters of blank space, many of the words in different reci-pes are deliberately written backward, abbreviations are marked by the same supralinear dots, and the abbreviation for “Name son of Name,” appears both as the standard p(eloni) b(en) p(elonit) and as the hith-erto unattested ŠWŠ, a sequence whose exact meaning still eludes me.9 Even the magical recipes themselves display a remarkable degree of internal consistency, both in their aims and in the magical practices they enjoin. In light of all this, it is quite certain that the scroll was produced by a single copyist, who was quite an experienced scribe and quite a sophisticated magician. On the verso, the scroll is sporadically covered by different magical texts, in several different hands, all of which seem to be later, and much less professional, than that on the recto. It thus seems quite clear that the rotulus was originally written on one side only (a common procedure on such rotuli), but later users decided to utilize the blank side too, and added their own magical recipes on the verso.10 This apparently means that the scroll remained in circulation and use over several generations of Jewish magicians. 7 Note that one of the two rotuli published by de Lange is estimated by him to have been about 3 meters long (Greek Jewish Texts, p. 165). 8 Both the hand and the style of writing closely resemble those of T-S Misc. 24.1 (see Neil Danzig, “Two Insights from a Ninth-Century Liturgical Handbook: The Ori-gins of Yequm Purqan and Qaddish de-Ḥadata,” in Stefan C. Reif (ed.), The Cambridge Genizah Collections: Their Contents and Significance (Cambridge: Cambridge Univer-sity Press, 2002), pp. 74–122 and Plate 10), which was dated by Danzig to the final quarter of the ninth century. 9 The most likely explanation seems to be that this is an abbreviation of ושם שם, “a name and a name” (i.e., the name of the victim and the name of his or her mother); as a partial parallel, one could adduce MS Sassoon 56 = NYPL 190, p. 117, ll.7–8: וכו׳ ש׳ פלוני׳ בן ש׳ פלו׳ האכזרי הארור המקולל מאת נקמתי את ונקמת (“And you shall exact my revenge from the accursed, the damned, the cruel pel(oni) Š son of peloni(t) Š, etc.”). It has also been suggested to me that שוש is four letters removed from פבפ, but this might be a mere coincidence.10 For Genizah rotuli whose verso is blank, see the next item.

Such uniformity of purpose is not unparalleled in some of the Greek magical papyri—I note, especially, PGM XXXVI, whose 19 recipes focus almost entirely on issues of interpersonal relations. These single-minded collections always make one wonder whether the prac-titioners behind them specialized in just one type of magical practices, or had their recipes arranged thematically, and only one of their col-lections (or a small part thereof ) happened to be preserved. But be that as it may, the recipes found on the Bodleian rotulus are of the greatest interest: They are written in a mixture of Palestinian Jewish Aramaic and Hebrew, and contain virtually no Arabisms, a sure sign of their relative antiquity. They also display many Greek loanwords, including what seems like a whole Greek sentence in transliteration, as we shall see below. Moreover, some of the rituals enjoined by these recipes seem quite different, and often far more “daring,” than those found in other Genizah magical texts, and this too might be a sign of their rela-tive antiquity, as in the later recipe collections the potentially offensive features tended to be filtered out of the textual transmission.11 Finally, the extant recipes contain a few apparent references to extra-biblical myths, which also are quite rare in the more typical Genizah magical recipe books. Below, we shall edit and analyze some of the recipes on the recto of this intriguing rotulus.2) T-S K 1.120 + T-S NS 258.153–154 + T-S K 1.154: The largest frag-ment of this rotulus is T-S K 1.154, a vertical parchment scroll 31.2 cm long and 8.8 cm wide, which is made up of three pieces sewn together, periods, see the rotulus edited by Tobi (above, n. 4). Some Genizah rotuli seem to have been written on both sides by their original scribes, including the two rotuli edited by de Lange (above, n. 4), and the one analyzed by Danzig (above, n. 8). Having seen numerous Genizah rotuli, my own impression is that most of them were written on the recto only, and that some retained a blank verso while in others the verso was re-used by later scribes, often for different types of texts than those on the recto. 11 For such processes of self-censorship, see Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic, pp. 183 and 344."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"326  gideon  bohakmeasuring (from top to bottom) 7.4, 13.5, and 10.5 cm, respectively.12 All three pieces are of a yellowish-brown color, and all three have their right margin intact, but are damaged on their left margin. Moreover, a stain caused by water runs vertically through all three pieces, and is the likely cause of the damage to the left margin, and certainly caused the effacement of many letters on the scroll’s left half. Like the Bodleian rotulus, this one too begins and ends in medias res, but in this case I can already point to three more fragments which clearly belong with the same rotulus. Two parchment fragments—T-S NS 258.153 and 154—are quite small, measuring 5.5 by 7 cm and 3.2 by 6.5 cm res-pectively, and neither fragment displays the telltale prick-holes charac-teristic of broken rotuli. But the fact that these parchment fragments are quite narrow, and inscribed on one side only, suggests that they may have come from such a rotulus (and not from a codex, in which both sides should be inscribed), and a comparison of the parchment and the handwriting with that of T-S K 1.154 demonstrates their great similarity. The identification is made secure by the pattern created by the stain which runs vertically through both fragments, and matches perfectly the stain running through the top part of T-S K 1.154, thus proving that all three fragments once belonged together, and that the damage caused by water preceded the disintegration of the original rotulus. Moreover, T-S K 1.120 (13.2 by 9.8 cm), which was published as MTKG III, 60 but not identified as forming part of a rotulus, dis-plays the same hand and the same stain, and ends with the first half of Num 21.28, whose continuation may be found on T-S NS 258.153. Thus, it is entirely certain that all four fragments once belonged in a single rotulus, and the original order was (from top to bottom) T-S K 1.120, T-S NS 258.153, T-S NS 258.154 and T-S K 1.154. Throughout the reconstructed rotulus, the right margin is well preserved, but the left margin is preserved only at the top section (T-S K 1.120) and parts of the bottom one (T-S K 1.154). On all four fragments the verso is blank, which means that this rotulus was not re-used by later scribes, perhaps because it was damaged by water at a relatively early stage. It must be stressed, however, that the reconstructed rotulus still begins and ends in medias res, so there is no doubt that more pieces are still 12 This fragment was briefly mentioned by Peter Schäfer, “New Magical Fragments from the Cairo Genizah,” in Proceedings of the Tenth World Congress of Jewish Studies, Section C/1 (Jerusalem, 1990), pp. 245–252, on p. 248 (Heb.)."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":" the magical rotuli from the cairo genizah 327missing both at the top and at the bottom of this scroll. If and when more pieces are found, they may allow a more precise reconstruction of this rotulus and of its codicological history.On the recto of the reconstructed scroll, 89 lines of text are written in a uniform hand, clearly later than that of the Bodleian rotulus (the hand was dated by Judith Olszowy-Schlanger to the (early) eleventh century).13 The text is written in a mixture of Aramaic and Judeo-Arabic, and some of the recipes use many biblical verses, which are cited in Hebrew. As this rotulus is not well preserved, it is not entirely clear how many recipes were written in the extant section, but one can detect the remains of at least ten different recipes and—as in the Bodleian rotulus—all of them are aggressive in nature. But unlike the Bodleian rotulus, the recipes found here seem much less unusual, and involve many magical practices which are quite standard in Genizah magical recipes. And while some of these recipes display signs of an early origin (including the use of the title קיבלוה for aggressive reci-pes, for which see Dan Levene’s paper in the present volume), others probably stem from the Genizah period itself, or are watered-down versions of older recipes. Thus they are of considerably less historical interest than those of the Bodleian rotulus.3) T-S K 1.50 + T-S K 1.133: Unlike the two previous items, this rotu-lus was first inscribed not with magical recipes but with an astrological text, best known as the Treatise of Shem in its Judeo-Arabic version (and in a phonetic transliteration which is characteristic of the ear-lier Judeo-Arabic Genizah fragments).14 T-S K 1.50 (6.9 cm long and 8.4 cm wide) preserves the section on Gemini, while T-S K 1.133 (25.1 by 8.8 cm) preserves the sections on Cancer, Leo, Virgo and Libra, so there is no doubt that the former once belonged directly above the latter, and that the original scroll was at least twice as long as these two fragments combined.

Like the Bodleian rotulus, this rotulus too was re-used by a later scribe, whose hand may be dated to the later ele-venth century, but this writer used the stitched up pieces of parchment not as a rotulus but as an horizontal scroll, on which magical recipes were written in columns, each some 6–7 cm wide. T-S K 1.50 preser-ves one full column of text and the end of another, while T-S K 1.133 preserves three columns of text and the beginning of a fourth one. Thus, the verso of both fragments presents the appearance of a parch-ment scroll—a very unusual occurrence in Genizah magical texts and in non-biblical Genizah fragments in general—but this is due solely to the re-use of an old rotulus.15 And in this case, the magical recipes are both aggressive and apotropaic (including a recipe for making an amulet), are written mostly in Judeo-Arabic, and display clear signs of a Muslim influence (including a reference to the lost tribes of ‘Ad and Thamud, mentioned in the Qurʾan). We may therefore conclude that both in format and in contents this scroll differs greatly from the two magical rotuli discussed above.Select Recipes from Bodleian Heb. a3.31These, then, are the Genizah magical rotuli currently known to me, and it is hoped that more fragments of these rotuli, and more Genizah magical rotuli, will be identified in the future. But as my own interests lie less in codicology and more in the magical texts themselves, the rest of the present paper will be devoted to a closer analysis of some of the magical recipes found on the recto of the Bodleian rotulus. Being one of the oldest Genizah magical texts identified thus far, and displaying a long set of magical recipes which are characterized by their purely Palestinian Jewish Aramaic idiom and many Greek loanwords, this collection offers an excellent point of entry into the world of Jewish magic in late-antique Palestine.

But be this as it may, the spell to be uttered is extremely interesting, for it consists of three Greek words, and may originally have consisted of four words, with one word now lost at the end of line 2. Of these Greek words, TY’WN is almost certainly Greek, theos, “god,” either in the accusative singular (theon) or in the genitive plural (theôn).19 The third word, QṬYGWRWS, certainly is the Greek katêgoros, which is quite common in rabbinic literature (but note how here it preserves the nominative ending, whereas in rabbinic literature it often loses it and becomes קטיגור), and means “accuser, prosecutor.”20 The second word, on the other hand, is less certain—it may be the Greek phainomai, “I appear, I come,” but is more likely to be pneuma, “spirit.” In the first case, the phrase might mean some-thing like “I come as an opponent of the gods,” whereas in the sec-ond case we might either assume a missing preposition at the end of line 2 and translate the whole sequence as “among the gods, the spirit is an accuser,” or assume a missing noun (or nothing missing) and translate “(X,) a spirit of gods, an accuser.”21 But be this as it may, it seems quite clear that we are dealing here with a short, but complete, Greek sentence, which would be quite like the famous transliterated Greek prayer in Sefer Ha-Razim, or the shorter Greek dismissal for-18 For קופד, see Samuel Krauss, Griechische und lateinische Lehnwörter im Tal-mud, Midrasch und Targum, 2 vols.

In the present instance, the difficulty is further exac-erbated by the damaged state of our text and by the uncertainty about the nature of the recipe as a whole (although the presence of katêgoros certainly argues in favor of an aggressive context), which makes it less clear what kind of Greek phrase we might expect here. But in all these cases, the very presence of Greek sentences and phrases attests to the extensive Greek influences on the Jewish magical texts of Late Antiq-uity, including those written in Hebrew and in Aramaic.b) The second recipe to be analyzed here, which is the fourth recipe on the recto of the Bodleian rotulus, involves an interesting example of a much debated issue in the study of late-antique Judaism, namely, the worship of angels, in this case on a do ut des basis, whereby the user of this recipe offers a specific angel various gifts, and explains what he or she would like to receive in return:]לח (קודם מרשם סוף) 11](ד)וא דמלח בולין 'וז פרתותין 'וז דאיבר 12]פוסיס קרי אנה לך 'ז ב'ז עליהון ואמור 13[לחמי ]מן לחם לך יהיב דאנה הכמה רבה מלאכה 14’ש’ו](’ש)ל תתן כן ממוני מן וממון מלחי מן ומלח 15[יקוצך](ש) מן ושיקוץ כיובך מן וכיוב ריוך מן ריוי 16] בשם ניצוצך מן וניצוץ ניאופך מן וניאוף 17] בפריע רבה סטנה סמאל ובשם כלקיטס 18(הבא המרשם תחילת) בויכל הדן 1911 (end of prev. recipe) (vac) For [. . . take . . .12 of lead and 7 chunks23 of bread and 7 lumps of salt and [13 and say over them 7 times,24 to you I call, PWSYS[22 For these, see M.

(vac) (beg. of next recipe)Unlike the first recipe we analyzed, here there are few problems of interpretation, in spite of the absence of a few letters at the end of each line.26 Here the practitioner is instructed to take lead, bread and salt, all in groups of seven (a common typological number in such recipes), to offer these to an angel, and to ask that angel to dispense some of his special qualities in return and send his dispute, pain, abomination, for-nication and spark upon the person’s opponent. Such a ritual must be seen in the light of the recurrent claims in ancient Christian literature concerning the Jewish worship of angels, and the recurrent rabbinic condemnations of such practices, which also are attested in Sepher Ha-Razim.27 In the present recipe, there is no doubt that the practitioner is appealing to a powerful evil angel, and is offering that angel monetary and alimentary offerings in return for his services. There also is no doubt that the angel is adjured by (the hitherto unattested KLQYṬS and by) “Samael the great satan,” who certainly is seen here as super-vising the powers of evil.28 In their search for aggressive powers, some 25 For ריו, see Sokoloff, Palestinian Jewish Aramaic, p. 523, for the meaning “appear-ance, form.” Such a meaning is not impossible here, but a meaning influenced by the Hebrew ריב, “strife, contest, dispute,” seems more likely. Another possibility would be that the original text read דיוי, or דוי, “sorrow.”26 There are, however, some obscure points, such as the meaning of the last word of our recipe, “for pain.” This might be a specification of the recipe’s aim, “for (caus-ing) pain,” and placing a recipe’s aim at the very end is paralleled both in this rotulus (in line 64), and in other Genizah magical texts. But in such a case, what should we make of the word ]לח with which the recipe opens, and which seems to state its aim, “For X”?27 See Margalioth, Sepher Ha-Razim, pp. 10–16; Michel-Yves Perrin, “‘Rendre un culte aux anges à la manière des Juifs’: Quelques observations nouvelles d’ordre his-toriographique et historique,” Mélanges de l’École Française de Rome: Moyen Âge 114 (2002): 669–700.28 For Samael, see Gershom Scholem, Kabbalah (Jerusalem: Keter, 1974), pp. 385–388; Günter Stemberger, “Samael und Uzza: Zur Rolle der Dämonen im späten Midra-sch,” in Armin Lange, Hermann Lichtenberger and K.

(vac) (beg. of next recipe)Like several other recipes in the Bodleian rotulus, this one too seeks to “bind” the male organ of its victim, a common magical practice in Late Antiquity, and one that also was known to, and discussed by, the rabbis of late-antique Palestine.31 It does this by way of an adjuration, accompanied by an interesting historiola (a mythical event used as a precedent or an analogy for the desired outcome of the magical proce-dure) and an intriguing ritual whose symbolic meaning is quite mani-fest. On the ritualistic-symbolical level, we see the practice (attested in other cultures as well) of “binding” a male victim by twisting a needle (whose phallic connotations are quite obvious) and turning it into a closed circle, with its tip inside its own eye (and thus unable to pen-etrate any other object).32 In this recipe, as in several other recipes in this rotulus and in other Genizah recipe books, and in the Sword of Moses as well, we also find instructions on how to loosen this piece of aggressive witchcraft once it is no longer deemed necessary—in this case, by taking the needle out of the dark spot in which it was buried and straightening it up, in the assumption that the same would now happen to the victim’s virile organ. On the mythical side, we have here a reference to the angel Qaṭriel (whose name is derived from the Aramaic root קטר, “to bind” + the standard ending -el, and who appears quite frequently in ancient Jewish magical texts), who came down from heaven to herd small cattle and bulls and “bound” (i.e., castrated?) the male bulls (a well known symbol of virility in many cul-tures, ancient and modern); just as this had happened in illo tempore, so shall the hapless victim be “bound” and rendered impotent as the practitioner wishes. The use of such historiolae is extremely common in ancient and medieval magical texts, including the Jewish ones, but whereas most Genizah magical recipes utilize well worn biblical stories as precedents—and especially the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, to 30 For שרייה, see the use of שריא, and דגברא שריא in MTKG III, 61 (= T-S K 1.162), 1c/25–1d/4.31 For the “binding” of bridegrooms, see Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic, p. 396.32 For a possible medieval Latin parallel, see Catherine Rider, Magic and Impotence in the Middle Ages (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 145."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":" the magical rotuli from the cairo genizah 335which we shall return below—the composer of this recipe made use of a non-biblical, and perhaps even non-Jewish, myth.33 Further research might shed more light on the possible origins of this myth, which does not seem to be an ad hoc invention but a casual reference to a myth which was circulating in the magician’s own world.d) The last two recipes in the extant part of our rotulus, and therefore also the best preserved, are also the most interesting. The first of these is described as intended to make peace between a man and a woman, but in fact is an aggressive / erotic magical recipe, involving the adju-ration and slaughtering of a white cock:[בין] שלם למרמי (קודם מרשם סוף) 117?ע](יול) עבשאו רווח לוגנרת כל בס איתה לבין גבר 118משבענה 'פ'ב'פ אנה רומאו נייחב אוהד דע 119על דיתיב עלייא דמלכה בשמה תרנגלה לך 120השנא ינבל שיבך תאד המך :דדינה כורסייה 121אברין 'ח'מ במאתין 'ש'ו'ש שבכתי נך הריעבלו 122'פ'ב'פ קודם מכיכה תהווי ונעמתה בה דאית 123(ה)ותהומ ה(ל)בחיי ארעה דכבש דכבשיאל בשמה 124?אשר ](ל)וכ יתעבדון עובדין אמרית מלין בתוקפיה 125מלייה לין]א 'וכת דכסיט נולטיף בסו :יצליח דיברתי 126היתי בהו] הרבגד יונאם נם דדוג בסו :בגווה 127בהו ב]הויג הבתך (!) הבו הלגנרת עוזבו הלטיפב 128[ד](ת)הלגנר :ראשה וכוף מעוי לגו דפיל פושן(ה) 129כיף עלוי [?הב](ו) התחרוא תשרפב רומטו יועמל 130מלייה אלין עלוי ואשבע חיווה יתה יפק דלא 131117 (end of prev. recipe) (vac) To make peace [between?118 a man and a woman, take a white cock and adjure over it119 while it is still alive and say, I, NN, adjure120 you, cock, in the name of the exulted king who sits upon121 the throne of judgment.

On the ritual level, the user is instructed to take a white cock, utter an adjuration over it, tear it apart, and place inside its intestines a tin lamella with the adjura-tion, a thread from the victim’s clothes (what James Frazer would call “magic of contagion”), and fine flour. The cock is then twisted into a kind of a knot (an action which certainly is intended as analogous to what would happen to the victim should s/he fail to comply), and buried at the crossroads, a common location for the practice of magic rituals in many ancient cultures, and perhaps also symbolizing here the desired meeting of the man and the woman.37 The use of white cocks in aggressive magical recipes seems to have been quite common, and one may cite parallels from other Genizah magical texts, from Sepher Ha-Razim (for which see Ithamar Gruenwald’s paper in the present 34 For נעמה, see Sokoloff, Palestinian Jewish Aramaic, p. 354.35 For פיטלון, see Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic, p. 374, n. 64; for כסיט = כסיטרון = Greek kassiteros, see Krauss, Lehnwörter, p. 556 (where the word is consistently spelled with a qof, not a kaf ).36 For נשופה, see Jonas C.

On the mythi-cal level, we find in the adjuration itself a reference to “Kabshiel who subdued the earth by his strength and the abyss by his might.” This angel, whose name is derived from the root כבש, “to subdue” + the standard ending -el, was extremely popular in ancient Jewish aggres-sive magic, and even the entire formula found here is closely paralleled in other Genizah magical texts and clearly was quite common in late antique Jewish magical texts.40 Embedded in the adjuration we also find an interesting expression, “Words have I spoken, deeds shall be done, and all [that?] I have spoken shall succeed,” which provides an interesting summary of the magician’s mindset and which—judging 38 See, for example, Bodleian MS Heb. a2.2; Sepher Ha-Razim I/160–169 (pp. 75–76 Margalioth); Levene, A Corpus, M163, p. 122: ך?י[ל ן]דמזמ חיורא תרנולא הנא תחות (“under this white cock that is appoin[ted on your beh]alf ”); bt AZ 4a–b // Ber 7a // San 105b, with Gideon Bohak, “Magical Means for Dealing with Minim in Rab-binic Literature,” in Peter J.

And sprinkle bef[ore144 his home. (vac) (beg. of next recipe)As in the previous examples, this aggressive magical recipe—intended to harm a person and exile him or her from their home—involves both a ritual and a mythical component. On the ritual side, a smelly concoction is prepared from six liquids and a root (the inclusion of which may be due in part to the similarity between “root” (עקר) and “uproot” (here תעקרון), and perhaps also to the similarity between צברה, “aloe, ” and רבץ, “to sprinkle”), and once the adjuration is uttered over it, it is sprinkled in front of the house of the intended victim. On the mythical side, we get an elaborate oral adjuration in which the unsavory concoction is equated with the dynamis of the great God, and with the spirit of the world by/with which God rained sulfur on Sodom, Gomorrah, Adama and Zeboim and brought about their utter destruction (see Genesis 19). In a similar manner, the magi-cian insists, shall the liquids manipulated here overturn and uproot and exile the victim from his or her home. And as if this was not enough, the spell adds the wish that all kinds of harmful spirits would descend upon the victim and harm him and exile him from his house, and all this in the name of Nuriel (whose name is made of “fire” + -el ending) and probably Hapkhiel (whose name is derived from the root HPK, “to overturn” + -el ending), who are here identified as part of the entourage of the angel of death. The use of Sodom and Gomorrah as a historiola in Jewish magical recipes—in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and later in Judeo-Arabic as well—is extremely common in Jewish magical texts, as is the identification of a substance used by the magi-cian with substances used in illo tempore to destroy the troublesome cities.45 Similarly, the appeal to the powers of evil should no longer surprise us, as we have found it in other recipes on this rotulus. But the use of the urine of several animals, and of the magician’s own urine, is—as far as I know—quite unattested in the Jewish magical tradition, and proves once again the relatively “daring” nature of the recipes found in the Bodleian rotulus. Finally, the sprinkling of the “adjured” substance in front of the victim’s home, yet another example of “contagious magic,” is well attested in other sources too; whether 45 For a fuller discussion of this point, see Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic, pp. 312–314."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"340  gideon  bohakthe stench would have made the victim leave his or her home is quite doubtful, but I suspect it could have made them aware that some foul act was being perpetrated against them.SummaryTo sum up: While rotuli and rotuli fragments are relatively rare in the Cairo Genizah, and magical rotuli extremely rare, those magical rotuli which happened to survive turn out to be of great historical importance. This is especially true of Bodleian Heb. a3.31, which is one of the old-est available Genizah magical texts, is entirely based on much earlier Palestinian Jewish recipes which seem to have been neither “updated” nor censored in any significant manner, and provides important evi-dence on the aggressive magical practices of the Jews of late-antique Palestine and early medieval Cairo. The significance of this evidence may be highlighted by noting that among many hundreds of Genizah magical texts transcribed within the framework of my research proj-ect, not a single one provided as many early Jewish magical recipes in such a good state of preservation and with such a high concentration of very “daring” aggressive magical recipes. Moreover, my search for parallels for the recipes contained in this rotulus did not come up with much, neither inside the Genizah nor outside it, which seems to imply that most of these magical recipes were not re-copied by later Jewish practitioners (perhaps because they were deemed too offensive in their blatant transgressions of some biblical and rabbinic injunctions and in their frequent appeals to the forces of darkness), and would have been utterly lost were it not for the chance preservation of this rotulus. In the future, more fragments of the above-listed rotuli, and of other magical rotuli, might be identified, and further enhance our knowl-edge of an important stage in the textual transmission of the Jewish magical tradition from Late Antiquity to the early Middle Ages."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"AN ARABIC VERSION OF “THE SWORD OF MOSES”Alexander FodorIn a recent article, I dealt with an Arabic version of Sefer ha-Razim, the manuscript of which I discovered in Egypt in 1973.1 As I have shown, this Christian Arabic manuscript which bears the title Sifr Ādam “The Book of Adam”) actually contained the translation of three different Jewish magical works. One of these proved to be a version of Sefer ha-Razim disclosing striking similarities with the work reconstruc-ted by Margalioth.2 This offered the general framework for the whole treatise which included two other magical works. One of these was a version of Ḥarba de Moshe (“The Sword of Moses”) which, however, did not even mention Moses as the recipient of the Ḥarba. The other piece contained many astro-magical elements and revealed a definite relationship to the Sefer ha-Yashar (“The Book of Righteousness”). A Jewish manuscript from Yemen which comprises versions of both Sefer ha-Razim and Sefer ha-Yashar was particularly illuminative in identifying the original source for the astro-magical section in the Ara-bic text.3 This Arabic Sifr Ādam in its ultimate form might have been the result of the redactional activity of a Coptic priest. In addition to the Christianization of the work, some Islamic influence can also be detected in the text.Recently, scholarly interest in Ḥarba de Moshe has manifestly grown. After a long period of silence, Gaster’s pioneering edition4 was followed by the publication of another version of the Ḥarba by Schäfer together with other pieces of the Hekhalot literature. In his edition of the Hekhalot texts, §§ 640–650 are related to what he calls Gaster’s Recension A, while §§ 598–622 can be connected to Gaster’s Recen-sion B.5 Yuval Harari’s new edition of the treatise with a comprehen-sive study on the whole subject may give a new impetus to research 1 See Fodor 2006.2 See Margalioth 1966.3 MS New York 40.

As a matter of fact, the questions raised by the study of the Ḥarba are clo-sely related to one of the main concerns of research on the relationship between Jewish liturgy, Hekhalot literature and magical ritual,10 so it will also be of relevance to show whether the Arabic text offers any clue for the elucidation of some problems in this respect. Since I do not wish to deal with the manuscript tradition of the Ḥarba in detail and since the occasional deficiencies of Gaster’s edition do not affect my way of research or conclusions, I usually refer to the latter when I quote the Ḥarba.Sefer ha-Razim in Margalioth’s reconstruction described the seven firmaments with their ministering angels and recorded their names together with the magical recipes which were selected on the basis of the competences of each angelic group. Assessing the importance of the magical element in Sefer ha-Razim, it is worthwhile to quote Joseph Dan’s opinion literally:11In spite of the fact that this is one of the most methodical and extreme magical works in the history of Jewish literature, it is clear that the 6 Harari 1997. 7 Rohrbacher-Sticker 1996. 8 See e.g. Bohak 1995 and Bohak 2001. 9 Herrmann 2005.10 For the state of research on this subject, see e.g. Naveh and Shaked 1993. 17–31; Shaked 1995, MTKG II, 1–25; Herrmann 2005. 177–179.11 Dan 1993, 19."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 343author regards magic as belonging to an inferior realm. In describing the forces which rule the first and second heavens—the lowest levels—the author goes into great detail about the magical use of the mixtures and incantations that must be used in order for one to accomplish what he seeks. However, as the descriptions ascend to the higher realms of the heavens, the magical element decreases, and for the seventh heaven there is no magical information at all. The message is evidently that the person is able to enlist the aid of the relatively inferior angels, those which are close to our world and in contact with it, whereas the superior forces which are linked to the divine Merkavah are above such matters.In contrast to this pattern, the Arabic version in Sifr Ādam separated the cosmological part of the original work from the practical section. Accordingly, at first it presented the description of the seven firma-ments enumerating the angelic hosts which were on duty in them, and after that, an independent section of magical recipes revealed the goals for which the angels could be used. Adhering to this general structure, when the first redactor or compiler reached the subject of the seventh firmament he gave a description along the lines of the related section in Sefer ha-Razim. However, when he was expected to present the magical recipes using the angels of the seventh firmament he was confronted by the fact that there were no angelic names in connection with the uppermost firmament since it was characterized by the presence of the angelic hosts singing hymns in praise of the Lord. Because of this, he could have suddenly felt himself compelled to include a version of Ḥarba de Moshe to repair this deficiency. Evi-dently, he did not feel himself restrained by the considerations exposed by Dan and ended up by presenting the most detailed magical material of the whole Sifr Ādam in connection with the seventh firmament. This surprising procedure could have been perfectly logical from his point of view—namely, in the same way as each of the preceding six firmaments was connected to a certain group of angels, it must have seemed only natural for him that this arrangement must also apply to the seventh. So, at least from the pure dramaturgical aspect the redactor was perfectly correct when he sensed a kind of rupture in the course of the cosmological description that refrained from mentioning any angelic name in this section.The Arabic “Sword” as the last section of the manuscript starts on page 162 and ends on page 223. The number of lines to the page is invariably 12 in agreement with the former pages.

Among the recognizable elements we can identify Michael, Gabriel, Rafael, Israel and such familiar expressions as Adonai, Adon, El, Hu El (“He is God”), Ze Hu (“This is He”), Gibbor (“Powerful”). Interestingly, the name S’M SYL’M also occurs in the list which most probably conceals “Semiselam,” a well-known name from Jewish magic and the Greek Magical Papyri, and which can be interpreted as shemi shalom (“My name is Peace”) or as shemesh ʿolam (“The Sun of the World”).12 The 12 For its occurrence in a Jewish magical text and for its interpretation, see e.g. SHL § 336, ÜdHL III. 3, n.8, MTKG I, 162, (Or. 1080.15.81, 1a/38.), 169; Swartz 1996, 116f; Leicht 1999, 159, n. 57."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 345last names contain the group M’RY QDŠ’Y’ R’Š’NY ML’ḪY’ which must be equivalent to Mari qadshayya rishon malkhayya (“Lord of the Holy Ones, Chief of the Angels”).The closing section of this introduction specifies the benefits which the names offer for the person who knows them and wears them—mentioning, among other things, that “he will have /arouse/ dread in the the eyes of the creatures” (wa-yakūnu lahu hayba fi ʾaʿyun al-mah̠lūqīn). It also prescribes the conditions which must be observed before using the names. First of all, the practitioner must be in a state of purity because the noble names conceal the “Greatest Name” (al-ism al-ʾaʿẓam). Interestingly, in addition to such well-known prohibi-tions concerning the consumption of wine and fish it mentions that anything ṭabīh̠ (“cooked”) or ḥarīq (“burnt”) is also among the for-bidden meals.13 The reason for this might be looked for in the direct connnection that may exist between the “cooked” or “burnt” food and the use of fire for their preparation. This prohibition may imply the reference to a day when labor was forbidden.It is evident at first sight that this introduction is completely dif-ferent from the relevant section in Gaster’s edition which starts with the description of the four angels appointed over the “Sword.” We can, however, find a passage of very similar content and tone in the Talmud Bavli which is preoccupied with the transmission of secret lore—namely, the forty-two-letter Divine Name—and stipulates the necessary preconditions for the operation in the following way:14אותו מוסרין אין אותיות ושתים ארבעים בן שם :רב אמר יהודה רב אמר ואינו משתכר ואינו כועס ואינו ימיו בחצי ועומד ועניו שצנוע למי אלא למעלה אהוב בטהרה והמשמרו בו והזהיר היודעו וכל מדותיו על מעמיד הזה העולם עולמים שני ונוחל הבריות על מוטלת ואימתו למטה ונחמד הבא והעולםIn translation:Rav Yehuda said: Rav said: As for the forty-two-letter Name, it must not be revealed except to him who is humble and modest, and stands in the 13 For the ban on the “cooked,” see a similar case in “The Apocalypse of Abraham” cited by Gruenwald 1980. 100.

For the translation of the text, see Gaster 1925–28a. 295, who treats the text from the aspect of the Name, and understandably does not pay attention to the subject of the “two worlds,” since it does not occur in the Ḥarba."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"346  alexander  fodormiddle of his days /life/, and is not (inclined to get) angry and is not (inclined to get) drunk, and does not insist on his rights. And everybody who knows it and keeps it and guards it in purity will be beloved above and desirable below and dread of him will be imposed on the creatures and he will gain two worlds, this world and the coming world.Although this passage does not mention the elements of the dietary regime, the reference to the ethical requirements, to the dread felt by fellow human beings toward the chosen person and to the possibility of gaining this world and the future world suffice to disclose a Tal-mudic provenance for the source of the Arabic text. The idea that the world to come is promised for the pious as a reward for the fulfillment of certain conditions including the knowledge of the secret name must have been a popular idea, since the very same motif occurs in different sources. So, although there is no trace of the phrase in the Ḥarba itself, it occurs regularly in the Hekhalot literature.15The importance of the subject can be understood in the light of the efforts to prove that God created two worlds, as shown by a passage in the Babylonian Talmud. At first, it claims that for him who places his trust in God, He will be a shelter in this world and the world to come. Then, to support the existence of these two worlds it says that God created them by using the letter yud and the letter hei from the name YH.16In connection with the importance attributed to the ethical requi-rements raised against the recipient of the “Sword,” it is worth men-tioning that the influence of the Psalms can also be detected in this respect as shown in another passage.17 Here, the Arabic version follows almost literally the text of the Ḥarba18 which describes the recipients as men “whose heart is not divided and in whose mouth is no duplicity, who do not lie with their tongues and do not deceive with their lips, who do not grasp with their hand etc.” This wording and the reference to the purity of the heart, the mouth and the hands can be compared to a verse of a similar content in Ps 24:4 which presents the person who deserves to ascend to God in the following way:15 See e.g. SHL §§ 377, 500, 705, 712, 940, 952, 953.

The arrangement of the recipes does not seem to disclose a themati-cally conscious structuring, but the first one is logically placed at the beginning since it wishes to show the practitioner how to decide the success or the failure of a would-be act:١٦٩–١٦٨ صلا أم نجحی شيءلا تعلم أن أردت فاذاأردت همامو لا ام يمهتقسـم وطریقكاذبحه سائبلا يوانلحا وهو يطلمغلا خذفان يفسـلا تذكر وانت شمسلا قدامنجحت فانت الوردين مقلوب ذبحه جاءئسیا ًيماتقسـم القطع وجاء نقلبی لم وانالأمر ذلك منIn translation:pp. 168–169If you wish to know whether the thing will succeed or notand your way is right or not and whatever you wish,take the MĠLYṬ and it is the animal which is gliding along, slaughter itin front of the sun while you recite the “Sword” and ifits slaughtering comes with the turning out of the two veins /?/ then you will succeedbut if it does not turn out /?/ and/while the cutting is straight /right/, be in despair because of this thing.CommentaryThe peculiar character of this recipe is enhanced by the fact that none of the prescriptions in Gaster’s versions of the Ḥarba de Moshe deals either with this subject or with the sacrifice of an animal for divinatory purposes. Although the description of the slaughter seems to be a lite-ral translation of the original Jewish text, the technical details are not"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"348  alexander  fodorclear enough to fully understand the whole procedure. Evidently, the position of the two veins (arteries?) after the ritual cutting of the neck plays a decisive role in recognizing the success of the future act or its failure. The scene of the ritual in front of the sun is unique among the recipes of this collection but it is quite familiar in other sources.19The Arabic text also deserves a few remarks. The word ward evi-dently stands for warīd, the Arabic equivalent for the Hebrew varid (“vein”). The expression al-warīdayn refers to the two veins which can be seen after the cutting of the neck. The identification of the ani-mal called MĠLYṬ is more complicated. As we can see, the Arabic text tries to interpret it as “the animal which is gliding along.” This would suggest that the translator might have thought of a “mole” (?) but there are a number of animals which could suit this description. In my view, however, the choice of a bird would have been more evident and familiar for the purpose of a divinatory procedure. It seems to be conceivable, and the presence of the consonants ġ, l, and ṭ may also suggest that the word could have originally stood for the Hebrew ʿayiṭ “bird of prey” which has been corrupted to become MĠLYṬ in the course of transcriptions by taking the yud for lamed.This recipe is immediately followed by another divination text which reveals a case of necromancy:يتم على وقفت واذاسرىيلا اذنه في يفسـلا هذا اسم اذكروتكون يكلمك هوف ههجو إلى نظرت ولااذنه ندع وفمك الارض إلى ناكيعIn translation:p. 169If you stumble upon a dead personrecite this “Sword” in his left earbut do not look into his face and he will talk to you whileyour eyes should be /directed/ to the earth and your mouth should be at his ear.19 See e.g. SHL §§ 621, 646–648, ÜdHL IV. 48, n. 4."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 349CommentaryNecromancy was well-known in Jewish magic as not only the locus classicus from the Bible (1 Sam 28:7–9) but other examples also attest to its frequent occurrences.20 There is, however, a basic difference between the biblical description of the practice and the procedure in our text. In the Bible, Saul, defying the prohibition of necromancy (among other pagan practices enumerated by Deut 18:11) asked the witch of Endor to bring up Samuel from the netherworld to hear his advice about the coming battle with the Philistines. Upon Saul’s request the witch adjured her familiar spirit who emerged from beneath the earth impersonating Samuel and answered Saul’s questions.In the Arabic recipe the practitioner acts in a more “real-life way” since he deals directly with a corpse from whom he expects to get the required answers by simply whispering the “Sword,” the secret Divine Name, into his left ear. On the other hand, the instruction to turn his eyes to the earth may indicate that he was supposed to communicate with the netherworld.21Gaster’s version of the Ḥarba offers a recipe which could have ser-ved as a prototype for the Arabic prescription, as No. 78 shows:22עד קהוהיהוט מן דשמאל אזנו על אמר מיתא עם למללא בעית ואם 78 .בחורתיהון ורמי נגזריקי ואד אהישוניIn Gaster’s translation:23To speak with the dead, whisper /the nomina barbara of/ No. 78 into his left ear and throw into their holes (?).The first part of the prescription is identical with the one in the Ara-bic version but the second instruction is completely meaningless. The reference to the “holes” may refer to the orifices of the body (of course, it is not “their” holes but “his” hole that is meant in the text). The context may also suggest that the “Sword” should somehow be allowed to get into the body. In contrast to this rather ambiguous wording, what distinguishes our text is its clear instructions for the practitioner 20 See e.g. EJ, s.v. “Divination.”21 In a magical rite (SHL § 424) the practitioner is instructed to whisper the names towards the earth, which means that he was supposed to get into contact with the demons (ÜdHL III. 182, n. 6).22 Gaster 1925–28b, 85.23 Gaster 1925–28a, 326."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"350  alexander  fodorconcerning his position during the performance which are in perfect agreement with the necromantic character of the act.The third type of divinatory recipe is represented by the following:١٧٩–١٧ ص٧تحضارسـلا ترتادسا وهذاًياهشفا تهبطومخا الأرواح من ئتش منالأسماء هذه واذكر نقكع إلى الماء في أقفيرهط سع يرنطمفط هوان نخو قوديدهفظ نغطقسيسف يسففع يهسـهلهقنتهقفقع يقنقتا نفع تمسهنت يهلسطيفلم يقعق سنيمهس سوفصتنیسفري يرزياهه يا ياهيضتعا سوسنبرقسمتقا يلهلجلا الملائكه ًأیضا تمنا يانصفالذي القدوس باسم يكمعل الأسماء هذهبسسيفجر ياهبصف ياهفعفو بدل له يسلياهنفطاسو ياهننوه يهسمعب نشهرشرملحوترا بورك يمشـ روخ يا ياهشـغ تاشـيههمونيتف ان واضاذ ينهاها لغولاموانظر همفوا به ارشد ما الى شفواتكوفي ولا سميج في نيییؤذ ولا نكمم واحداارید من واحضر اصل يفك وتعرفوني عقليتقربت أن احذر وإلا طاهر نتك فان نكممبتغور هّٰالل ارشدك وإن تفتتل ولا هميلإفلا بهحوتصا همنم ًئايش تحضرسـت أنلك أجود هوف بكككو لصاحب إلا يلتميفسـلا اسم اذكر تصرفه أن أردت واذانصرفی وهوIn translation:pp. 177–179And this is the preparation for adjuringwhomever you wish from the spirits and for talking to him mouth to mouth:"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 351Stand in the water up to your neck and recite these names:QWDNḪW NHW FṬNṬMYR Sʿ HṬYRHLSYH FFʿYS FSYNĠṬQS ẒHFYDLYH TNHTMS NFʿ ’TNQYQ QFQʿHTNHQYNTSWFṢ SHYMSN ʿQYQ FLMSṬYQBRNSWS ’T ʿYḌY’H Y’ HYRZY’H YSFRṢFNY’, you, too, the sublime angels I conjuredyou by these names, by the name of the Holy One thathas no substitute ʿFWFY’H BṢFY’H ĞRFSYSRŠRHNŠ BSMʿYH HNWNY’H ’SWNF ṬY’HHYŠT’ ĠŠY’H Y’RWḪ ŠYM KBWR MLḤWTR’LĠWL’M ’H’HYN W’Ḍ’D̠ to make me understandand to reveal for me what I will be guided by and what I will understand and /let me/ seeone of you and do not let him hurt me either in my body or inmy mind and let me know how I can reach and adjure whom I wishamong you.

The indication of the aim of the procedure: the request of a perso-nal encounter with an angel.2. The practitioner is instructed to stand in water up to his neck as a precondition to receiving the angelic being.3. The recitation of an incantation text which is made up mainly of unintelligible nomina barbara.4. The dismissal of the angel.Starting from the basic instruction of the prescription, this type of recipe in the Jewish sources can particularly be associated with the adjuration of the Sar ha-Panim, the “Prince of the Presence,” describing the method by which he can be forced to appear to the practitioner.24 24 For the adjuration of the Sar ha-Panim, see Gaster 1925–28b, 91–93; Gaster 1925–28a, 332–336; SHL §§ 623–639.

These terms are of a rather general character, so do not specify the mode of the angel’s arrival which in the Jewish sources is conceived of as a descent. The use of the Arabic word istinzāl (“wishing someone’s descent”), a customary technical term in Arabic magical recipes, would have expressed this notion in a more adequate way if this was originally meant.In the gibberish of the nomina barbara only those ending in Y’H for yah, as a variant of the Tetragrammaton, can be clearly discerned. The last names, however, composed of Y’RWH̠ ŠYM KBWR MLH̠WTR’ LĠWL’M ’H’HYN W’ Ḍ’D̠ evidently conceal the well-known blessing Barukh shem kevod malkhuto le-ʿolam va-ʿed (“Blessed be the Name of the glory of His kingdom for ever and ever”) which also closes the adjuration of the Sar ha-Panim.26 These distorted words in the Arabic text appear as organic parts of the magical names but their original function as a blessing was, of course, totally different. It evokes the ritual on the Day of Atonement when in the imitation of Aaron’s act, the High Priest was supposed to lay his hands over the goat, confess the sins of the people and then send the goat to the wilderness (Lev 16, 21). The High Priest had the privilege of pronouncing the Ineffable Name during the ritual and upon hearing the Name, the congrega-tion responded to it by prostrating themselves and reciting the Barukh Shem formula.27 This also is the blessing which should be recited in a low voice after the first sentence of the Shema.28 So the occurrence of this expression in a magical text after the recitation of a group of magi-cal names which stand for the Ineffable Name, might be interpreted as a conscious imitation of the Yom Kippur ritual.29 As a matter of fact, the command for the practitioner to stand in water up to the neck 25 See e.g. SHL §§ 489, 495, 544, 572, 663.

When he got to Haran, he said: ‘Is it possible that I have passed through a place in which my ancestors have prayed, and I did not say a prayer there?’ He wanted to go back. As soon as the thought of going back had entered his mind, the earth folded up (qafaṣ) for him. Forthwith: ‘He lighted upon a place.’ (Gen. 28:11)In the Genizah recipes Jacob’s story served as a case of reference, and as a kind of historiola was thought to be enough to guarantee the repe-tition of the same occurrence for the practitioner.Seemingly, our Arabic recipe is more elaborate in the details and its main elements present a well-defined structure:32 Gaster 1925–28b, 85; Gaster 1925–28a, 326.33 b San 95a–95b, Talmud 1985, 121 (transl.)."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 3571.

The declaration of the success of the procedure.This success is technically assured if one knows the appropriate names.The text, however, is not completely unequivocal as to the addressee of the adjuration. At the beginning, the presence of a masculine 3rd person singular pronominal suffix (tastaḥlifuhu) would imply only one angelic being, but at the end the whole group of angels is adjured (aqsamtu ʿalaykum). The main protagonist in this angelic community is definitely Meṭaṭron who appears as the head of the angels ministe-ring in front of the Throne. It is thus possible that the adjuration was directed to him disguised behind the singular personal pronominal suffix and then all the angels serving under him were called upon to ensure the efficacy of the invocation.The word Q’DWŠ separating 70 names is a clear reference to the main element in the heavenly liturgy, the qadosh of the Qedusha, the Trisagion as described in Is 6:3. The number 70 has multiple impor-tance and can also be connected to Meṭaṭron himself. The redactor of the Arabic “Sword” might have felt himself absolutely justified by giving an eminent place to Meṭaṭron when he wanted to populate the Seventh Firmament with the angelic hosts performing the qedusha. According to 3 Enoch, God gave a throne to Meṭaṭron and seated him on it at the gate of the Seventh Hekhal; when Rabbi Yishmaʿel met him there Meṭaṭron disclosed to him that he had 70 names in conformity with the 70 languages of the earth.34 In addition, the number of angels who represented the different nations in the heavenly community and who were put under Meṭaṭron’s authority was again 70.35 They might 34 3 Enoch x 2.

If thou wishest to pass dryshod through the sea, say upon the four corners of the head-dress (turban) No. 76, and take one corner in thy hand and the other is (?) to precede thee.CommentaryIt is evident that the Arabic version is simpler but definitely much clea-rer in its instructions although it does not say how the names should be written. The Jewish-Aramaic recipe appears to be more elaborate, but the prescription to take a corner of the head-dress in the hand and then to follow it seems to be a bit enigmatic. First of all, if it is really about the practitioner’s head-dress, in the given situation it would be technically too difficult to take it off and then follow the instructions. Another interpretation, however, is also possible if we suppose that not the head-dress but the traditional prayer shawl, the tallit, was meant by the sudra and the client was instructed to grasp one of the four fringes, the ṣiṣit-s attached to it. The magical importance of the ṣiṣit is 38 Gaster 1925–28b, 84. 39 Gaster 1925–28b, 325."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"360  alexander  fodorwell-known,40 so it is quite acceptable to think that one of the fringes played the role of the practitioner’s guide through the sea.It would be too misleading to compare this procedure to the descrip-tion of Jesus’s walking on the Sea of Galilee (Mt 14:25–26). Apart from the similarity of the aims concerning the crossing of water, the reali-zation is totally different. Jesus was represented as walking effectively on the sea while the magical recipe helped the practitioner to part the waters in front of him (literally he pushes the waters back). So the pro-totype of the act must be sought in the story of the Exodus when the waters of the Red Sea were divided and Moses and his people could cross the sea on dry ground (Ex 14:21–22). What is worth mentioning in this respect is the fact that the Arabic text does not contain the slightest hint of this event.On page 180 of the Arabic manuscript starts the version of the Ḥarba de Moshe proper which seems to correspond more or less to Gaster’s text. The transition from the preceding section to this is sol-ved in a very clever way, and again the “dramaturgically” conscious redaction must be emphasized. As a matter of fact, there is no real introduction in the well-known version of the Ḥarba because it starts rather abruptly with the announcement that four angels are appointed over the “Sword.” The redactor of the Arabic recension simply presents another magical prescription in the list of recipes, which says that he who wishes to be elevated to a higher position among people should know the names of the four angels appointed over the “Sword.” As for the preconditions to use the ‘Sword’, in addition to the general ethical and dietary requirements mentioned already in Gaster’s Recension A, our text also requests the eating of ḥalāl (“permitted”) food with salt as the sign of a covenant.41 This peculiar instruction must be an echo of such biblical prescriptions which order that all food offerings should be made with salt (Lev 2:13).Similarities occur particularly in the historical introductory parts preceding the recipes which, however, reveal significant differences both in their number and in their content.

Fol-lowing the arrangement of the Ḥarba, the first group consists of four angels, then comes a group of five and finally a group of three which occupies the lowest position in the Arabic version.42 Seemingly, the adjuration repeated three times wishes to correspond to these three groups.The main elements of the Arabic text can be summed up in two basic points: at first, the practitioner applies for the revelation of the “Sword”; then, having received it, he can ask for the fulfilment of his request with its help. Again, it is not quite clear who is addressed at the beginning to reveal the secret; we can only suppose that Meṭaṭron is called upon and referred to by the 3rd masculine singular pronominal suffix. The fact, however, that the adjuration must be repeated three times and the practitioner even menaces the heavenly hosts that he will stop his supplication if he does not get a hearing, indicates that there is an enmity on the part of the angels toward the human being. Finally, he has to make recourse to the use of the Divine Name by the force of which the angels cannot refuse his request any more—because in this case they must take it as if God Himself had asked them.This scene may recall a similar event in 3 Enoch when God has to declare that whatever Meṭaṭron says in His name the angels have to obey. The text relates that when Moses reached the 7th Hekhal during 42 Sifr Ādam, 193–198."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"364  alexander  fodorhis heavenly ascent, Meṭaṭron wanted to disclose secrets to him but the angels opposed this and at first were inimical toward the human being whom they considered impure.

Its exact place should have been among the names of the “Sword” between HDRS’ and HYDRSṬ’ but none of the texts of the three edi-ted versions contains it.As we see, the components of the text can be traced back to the Bible, Midrash, Mishnah and the Shemone Esre, and they represent the permanent formulae in the magical adjurations. Some elements deserve particular attention. The blessing in lines 6–8 is identical with Ps 72:19 (“And blessed be his glorious name: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen and Amen”). It also has a close paral-lel in the heavenly liturgy of Is 6:3 (“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory”).56 Following this, lines 8–9 49 Ps 72:1950 See above, nn. 27, 29.51 Tanḥuma, Parashat Ve-ethanen, No. 6, dibbur ha-mathil: al-tosef. For their occurrences in magical texts, see e.g. MTKG II. 133 (No. 29, 1b/2). 52 These kinds of epithets structured in the form of a status constructus are fre-quent in Hekhalot literature in the form of double construct states like melekh mal-khei ha-melakhim or qedosh qedoshei ha-qedoshim (for the latter see also ÜdHL IV. 29, n. 4) like in SHL § 631. The constructions el elohim, “god of gods” and adon ha-adonim, “lord of the lords” in a slightly corrupted form can also be found in the Arabic “Sword” 180.53 This epithet occurs also in the first benediction of the Shemone Esre. See also Gen 14:18–20, 22; MTKG II, 219 (No. 38, 1b/8).54 Ex 15:3; MTKG II, 219 (No. 38, 1b/7).55 Ps 18:47, cp. also 2 Sam 22:47.56 For its occurrences in Hekhalot literature, see e.g. SHL §§ 183, 951, 966."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 367present the Barukh Shem formula, the standard element of the magical adjurations.The epithets ḥay ve-qayyam (“living and eternal”) frequently appear as a pair but apart from their occurrence in the Midrash, the expres-sion shmo ḥay ve-qayyam (“His name, living and eternal”) is the clos-ing phrase of one of the blessings, the maʿariv ʿaravim to be recited after the Shema: וקיים חי .שמו צבאות יהוה לילה ומביא יום מעביר ועד לעולם עלינו ימלוך תמיד (“He makes the day pass and he brings the night, Lord of hosts is His name. Living and Eternal, may He rule upon us for ever and ever”).57Doubtless, the most questionable expression in this tentative recon-struction is the interpretation of TNWʿWZ TMWFT̠MT as ḤNWN ḤNWNYM in Line 11. In theory, only its context—preceded by two similarly formed status constructus—and the rhythm of the letters would suggest such a highly hypothetical solution. It is a fact, how-ever, that the name ḥanun (‘compassionate’) is another frequent epi-thet of God58 and the combination of the consonants themselves with the presence of similar letters like the t (which could have easily been copied from a Hebrew quadrate ḥ), the w and the m may also indicate the plausibility of this identification. At any rate, even if this is not the case, we still have another pair of two magical names which can perhaps be related to TFṢMT and TFSNRNY in Gaster’s edition (listed under Nos. 33 and 44).59The Arabic text of the “Sword” ends with these lines:۲۲٣–٢٢١ صتكئكملا على سلاملواخدامك على سلام نصورينلما المؤیدينخدامك على سلام هجينتبلما المرشدينالطاهرين العظماء خدامك وعلى ينكبارلماالمعظمه الأقوياء ينفالمخو ينسالمقدالرسائل في ينعسرلما يمبالكارو يرهنلا57 For the popularity of this double epithet, see also 3 Enoch xv B 3; SHL §§ 558, 592, 976.

And glory be to God permanentlyas long as there is night and day in peacefrom God.Amen.CommentaryThis closing passage is totally different from the end of the edited versions of the Ḥarba. First of all, as can be expected from a work which describes the Seventh Firmament and is deeply influenced by the description of the heavenly scene in Is 6:3, it blesses the host of angels who minister in front of the Throne. In this context, when it speaks about the Cherubs which appear as “beast, lion, bull and man” and which have not been mentioned earlier, it refers evidently to the four faces of the Cherubs in Ez 10:14 or of the ḥayyot, the four “living creatures” in Ez 1:10.60 Naturally, the lists of the four figures are not completely identical and the change of the original “eagle” for waḥš, “beast” in the Arabic text is hard to explain. In addition to this, the four Cherubs here are represented as independent figures; in this res-pect they resemble more the four living creatures in Rev 4:7.Another new element appears with ‘YRFYWQS who was not men-tioned until this last section, and it is not clear who is hidden behind this undeciphered name. What seems to be evident is his leading posi-tion in the heavenly community. On this basis, even Meṭaṭron could be concealed behind the name since his importance was manifest in the quoted passages. The name ‘YRFYWQS could have been the result of a multiple mis-transliteration of Meṭaṭron’s name written in qua-drate characters.Apart from these blessings on the protagonists of the liturgical scene in the Seventh Firmament, the redactor greeted all the angels who ser-ved in the other firmaments and also those who appeared in the astro-magical section. On the one hand, this was in conformity with his redactional technique on the basis of which he considered each of the 60 For the occurrence of the ḥayyot with the different faces in the Hekhalot litera-ture, see e.g. SHL § 954."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"370  alexander  fodororiginally independent three works as organic parts of what he called Sifr Ādam, (“The Book of Adam”). On the other hand, however, this time he referred only to the Sifr al-H̠afāyā (“The Book of Secrets”), the Arabic equivalent for Sefer ha-Razim, saying that it was finished. By this statement he seemingly reconfirmed his own claim that the des-cription of the Seventh Firmament with all the angels and the nomina barbara must represent the closing chapter of one and the same work, let it be called Sifr Ādam or Sifr al-H̠afāyā.ConclusionsFrom all that has been said above, some basic points can be put together to form a general idea about the Arabic version of the Ḥarba de Moshe. We can also arrive at some remarks which may help us to better understand the background of the original magical treatise and the governing principle that motivated its composition.The most striking characteristic of the Arabic text is that the name of Moses as the receiver of the revelation of the “Sword” is totally mis-sing. In the Arabic version the whole section comes under the headline Sayf Allāh (“The Sword of God”) but the name Yad Allāh (“The Hand of God”) is also mentioned as its equivalent. In spite of this, however, the appearance of Meṭaṭron in the text several times and the evident importance attributed to his figure might suggest that he could have been considered as the revealer of the “Sword.” A kind of special rela-tionship between the “Hand of God” and Meṭaṭron is signalled by the text which says that God placed His Hand on Meṭaṭron’s head.61 The connection between Meṭaṭron and a special group of magical names called ḥarba (literally “lance” in Arabic) must have been a well-known idea in the Arabic milieu. A chapter in the famous magical encyclopae-dia, the Šams al-Maʿārif written by al-Būnī (d. 1226 CE), speaks about different ḥarba-s attributed to Meṭaṭron, ʿAzrāʾīl, Yūšaʿ (Joshua, whose ḥarba was identical with Meṭaṭron’s) and a certain ʿAbd al-Qayyūm (referred to as falaku l-šams, “sphere of the Sun,” perhaps a mistake for malaku l-šams, ‘the angel of the Sun’).62 The text makes it clear that these ḥarba-s are composed of the names of angels who are appoin-ted over the different firmaments. So, Meṭaṭron’s ḥarba contains the 61 SHL § 95762 al-Būnī, Šams III, 93. Cited by Vajda 1948, 389; and Harari 2005, 298, n. 25."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 371names of the angels of the 3rd firmament because the Šams assigns him this firmament. This magical cosmology must have been influen-ced by the Sefer ha-Razim since this section of the Šams also alludes to the Sifr Ādam, “The Book of Adam,” as one of its sources.63The word Sayf in itself as the name of a large group of nomina barbara is understandable because it reflects the original meaning of the word ḥarba in the sense that Moses used the divine names in the form of a powerful adjuration as a real sword.64 The Jewish equivalent of the other expression, “the Hand of God,” which occurs also in the Ḥarba65 on several occasions is in perfect harmony with this idea since it symbolizes God’s power as attested by a number of biblical verses.66 The appearance of God’s hand on different synagogal representations indicates that this symbol was generally known and accepted in this sense in spite of its possible anthropomorphic connotations.67 As a matter of fact, judged by the frequent occurrences of the expression Yad Allāh in the Qurʾān,68 the image of the ‘Hand of God’ might have been among the ideas that could have been easily acceptable in an Islamic milieu.Not only was Moses ignored, but any other hint that could be directly connected to a definite Jewish background disappeared. Accordingly, such elements of the Jewish-Aramaic version of the Ḥarba as the emphasis placed on the role of Moses, the mentioning of the names of Rabbi ʿAqiva or Rabbi Yishmaʿel, the explicit reference to the Sar Torah or Sar ha-Panim complex or to the Israelites, or even to the God of the Israelites came to be simply “censored out.”69 The reason for this can most probably be explained by the person of the editor.63 al-Būnī, Šams III, 94. A Sifr D̠ī l-Qarnayn, “The Book of Alexander the Great,” is also mentioned here among the sources.64 Harari 2005, 298, 301; Herrmann 2005, 198.65 Gaster 1925–28b, 70/31, 72/7,9, and especially 93/18 which says Mashbiaʿ ani alekha be-yamin qadosh, (“I conjure thee with the right hand of sanctity,” Gaster 1925–28a, 336). See also Sifr Ādam 221.66 Ex 15,6. The “hand” as a symbol is particularly popular in the Psalms: Ps 17:7, 20:6; 44:3; 60:5; 63:8; 91:7.67 For the “Hand of God,” see Bar Ilan 1993. For an amulet with the “Hand of God” from the 3rd–5th centuries CE, see Goodenough 1953. 219, Fig.1024. For the symbolism of the “hand” in general, see Jewish Symbols 70f.68 See e.g. Q 3:73; 5:64; 9:29; 48:10; 57:29.69 For the procedure of “censoring in” and “censoring out” certain elements of a text, see Hoffman 1981."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"372  alexander  fodorIn this respect, the question of the date of the work must also be raised here. Without going into details, I think the data offered by Ibn al-Nadīm’s Fihrist70 when it mentions a Sifr Ādam claimed by the Jews, can be accepted as terminus ad quem. As for the terminus post quem—we have a much wider range of time. Regarding Gaster’s Jewish-Ara-maic recensions, I think he might have been right when he advocated the idea that quite a number of the components could be traced back to the first centuries CE, notably to the world of the Greek Magical Papyri.71 He also rightly emphasized the parallels in the structuring of the Ḥarba and the Papyri.72 The Ḥarba starts with the description of the heavenly hierarchy, continues with the elaboration of the nomina barbara and finally presents the magical prescriptions. In a very simi-lar way, the Papyri present the following arrangement: cosmogonical section—unintelligible names—magical recipes. Thinking, however, of the Arabic “Sword” and particularly of its Jewish-Aramaic source, I agree with those opinions which are inclined to place the final redac-tion of the Jewish work in the second half of the first millenium.73 This can be particularly valid of the work that served as the source for the Arabic version. The numerous connections to the different pieces of the Hekhalot literature and its milieu seem also to support this sup-position. As I will try to show, the Geonic Period and Mesopotamia as the place could have been particularly appropriate to the emergence of the Arabic version.Starting from this assumption, we may suppose that the redactor could have been an opponent of official Rabbinic circles from within the Jewish community who wanted to write an independent treatise void of any closer indication of the direct Jewish connection, because he had a larger public in mind. This work could have served as a basis for an Arabic translation either by the same person or another member of his community dealing with magical practices. As for his religious preferences, he could have been somebody who favored Meṭaṭron’s paramount role and his elevated position which was second only to God. With this attitude he might have opposed Rabbinic circles who wished to lessen Meṭaṭron’s importance. An evident sign of this is that his name occurs only three times in the Talmud.74 As a matter 70 Ibn al-Nadīm, Fihrist 379.71 Gaster 1925–28a, 311; Rohrbacher-Sticker 1996, 46 also supports this idea. 72 Gaster 1925–28a, 308.73 ÜdHL IV. X–XII, Harari 2005. 296f. See also Wandrey 2004, 9.74 EJ s.v. “ ‘Meṭaṭron.”"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 373of fact, the redactor was right when he emphasized Meṭaṭron’s role as the revealer of the secret and ignored Moses as its recipient, since 3 Enoch firmly established this view.75 He could also have been a Jew who converted to Islam, who wished to transmit a definitely impor-tant and popular work to his new coreligionists in a form that had to be modified according to their taste. Whatever the case was, the use of Arabic as the vernacular of the transmitting medium was a good choice since everybody must have understood it. Although the final redaction of the complete Arabic version in view of the characteris-tically Egyptian allusions and expressions in the text (which do not occur in the Ḥarba) can be attributed with most certainty to a Copt, it seems highly improbable that he could have been its original trans-lator or even redactor. The skill manifested in the elimination or the “censoring out” of the non-desired elements from the text, the deep knowledge of biblical and Talmudic lore, the consequent adherence to some basic points in creating a unified work from three different pieces—all of these would contradict this hypothesis.As we have seen, the unified character of Sifr Ādam was assured by the inclusion of the Ḥarba de Moshe material into the general fra-mework of Sefer ha-Razim as the description of the Seventh Firma-ment. A further technical procedure to create the impression of one single work was offered by the use of a few permanently recurring expressions like ṭūbā li-l-rağul (“happy is the man”), the Arabic equi-valent for the Hebrew ashrei adam throughout the text.76 Limiting ourselves to the examinaton of the Ḥarba de Moshe section in our Arabic version we can delineate the following main elements in pre-senting the material:1. Description of the conditions required for the use of the “Sword” (concerning the performer’s physical and spiritual purity, his even-tual acts or bodily positions, the timing of the procedure)2. The prescription proper consisting of:a. the announcement of the concrete purposeb. the recitation of the “Sword” (the nomina barbara representing the Divine Name) to adjure the angels serving the names75 See above, n. 43.76 In addition to the above cited introductory passage of the “Sword” (Sifr Ādam 162), see also Sifr Ādam 179, 184, 194, 199, 200, 201, 221."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"374  alexander  fodorc. the recitation of a certain liturgic formula (the Barukh Shem blessing)d. the dismissal of the angelsThis consciously followed structure gains a deeper sense with the help of an exceptionally illuminating source of the Geonic Period which had already been used by Gaster, but the importance of which has never been assessed in its real dimensions to the best of my knowledge. Since Gaster was too keen on showing the ancient origin of the Ḥarba and its relationship with the world of the Greek Magical Papyri, he did not pay enough attention to the milieu in which the formation of the magical material received its final shape. The source in question is the Responsum of Ḥai Gaon (d. 1037) which he sent to the Jewish com-munity in Qairouan answering their questions about certain customs which must have been familiar to everybody at that time.77From the letter of the community we may assume that these acts could have been quite easily considered as magical procedures and this is why they were so anxious to get the Gaon’s answer. At first they inquired about some magical practices, but their main problem concerned a general phenomenon. Putting their cautiously formula-ted question in a more direct way, they wanted to know whether it is acceptable if a man who protects the Name in purity and is just, old, has a broken heart and praiseworthy qualities, presents his request during prayer and then pronounces that particular Name in the moment when “YY” (the Name of the Almighty) should be said at the end of the prayer or blessing.To summarize the Gaon’s answer I have picked out the basic points from his Responsum in the following arrangement because they seem to be the most relevant for our subject:שם שאומ׳ יש כי אמרתם כאשר עיקר כל היותם אפשר שאי דברים ויש .הלסטים מן עצמם ומחביאיןהמת על אומרו אתה זה [שם] כי ומהם אחרים דברים עוד בהם ויש .חיה והואובלחישות בקמיעין רגיל היה כי טוענים היו ז״ל הכהן משה למר אבל בהן וכיוצאובית בבל למדינת קרובין הם כי רחבים הללו דברים היו סורא ובישיבת אפשר שאי הדברים מן אינו דרך וקפיצת .משם רחוקים ואנו נבוכדנצר77 Teshuvot, No. 115.

Since it has already been declared that it is forbidden to pronounce it in our places and in your places. And to that, who knows how it should be pronounced and maybe he who pronounces it makes such a mistake which entails a sin. In spite of this, in such a place where it is appropriate to pronounce it, it is not correct to include it in some blessing. But he who pronounces it should arrange it in /a special/ seder (“order”) and should say after it praise /Psalm/, laudation and glorifi-cation like the seder of the Throne Song and after it he should ask his request from the Almighty.From this summary the following picture arises about the Gaon’s per-sonal views concerning the questions of the Qairouan community: He flatly refused to give credit to such magical procedures which preten-ded to be capable of making someone invisible or raising the dead but he seemed to accept the possibility of the qefiṣat derekh, “the path jumping’. He also acknowledged that there were people like a certain Mar Moshe ha-Kohen who dealt with amulets and magical adjurations indicating that the questions posed to him reflected everyday problems not only for the Qairouan community but also for his own coreligio-nists. More important, however, is what he says about the most popu-lar magical works in use and about the technique generally applied in magical procedures.From the evidently high number of magical works and fragments (which might have been separate magical prescriptions scribbled occa-sionally on pieces of some writing material) he deemed it necessary to cite the Sefer ha-Yashar and the Ḥarba de Moshe, and in this order. Although the Gaon did not mention Sefer ha-Razim, the first com-ponent in our Sifr Ādam—and it might, of course, be a sheer coinci-dence—it is certainly interesting that the redactor of our manuscript included these two treatises in his work in the very same arrangement. It is also remarkable that the Gaon referred to the pieces of Hekhalot literature (hekhalot ravta and ze’irta) together with the magical books revealing the existence of the close connections between them.As for the description of magical procedures, at first he warned against uttering the /Ineffable/ Name in supplications, emphasizing that nobody knew how to pronounce it in a correct form. On the other hand, however, he approved of its use on condition that it was inclu-ded in a special seder imitating the liturgy of the Throne Song and was followed by the recitation of different kinds of songs of praise. Here, he might have had in mind the parallel scenes of the heavenly"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 377liturgy as they were described in the Hekhalot literature in the fol-lowing form:78ותפארת תהלה וזמרה הלל ושבח שיר וזמרה שירה בכסאך כוננת׳ את׳ כי .ונצחIn translation:Because You directed on Your Throne song and song of praise, song and glorification, exultation and song of praise, and praise and glory and jubilation.Or in another place:79והלל שבח ברכה וזמרה שירה תהלה וקילוס בשיר ויפתחוIn translation:And they burst into song and rejoicing, praise, song and song of praise, blessing, glorification, and exultation.It is striking that the Gaon uses the same technical terms (tehilla, zimra, ševaḥ) as the Hekhalot texts to designate the different kinds of hymns, so the literally identical phrasing cannot be a coincidence.80 This also means that he practically described existing and widely spread practices. Actually, the main elements we can bring together from the different magical recipes seem to comply with the Gaon’s advice in every respect. In the quoted magical prescriptions, the “Sword” which was supposed to contain the Ineffable Name or appeared as the Name itself, was followed by the Barukh Shem blessing or other liturgical components as we have seen in the case of the reconstructed hymn of praise.We have tried to show that the general structure of the magical procedures based on the use of the nomina barbara or voces magicae (containing the Ineffable Name) followed by a liturgical element (the Barukh Shem blessing) could be discovered equally in the Hekhalot literature, the Jewish magical texts and in the different recensions of the Ḥarba including the Arabic version. Speaking about the influence of liturgy on the magical rituals, an important formula of the Arabic text must not be left unnoticed.78 SHL § 594.79 SHL § 974.80 3 Enoch also uses these terms, see e.g. i 12, xv 20, xlviii A 2."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"378  alexander  fodorWe have to refer again to the Arabic expression starting with ṭūbā li-l-rağul (“‘Happy is the man”) which, as we have seen, regu-larly appears in the text of the three components of Sifr Ādam.81 This expression is not only a literal translation of the Hebrew ashrei adam (“Happy is the man”) used as a simple stylistic device, but again indi-cates the presence of a very consciously selected liturgical element. It can be related to the use of the Psalms in the Ashrei prayer82 made up of Ps 145 and some other verses (see especially Ps 84:13) which are read both in the morning and in the afternoon services. The different pieces of the Hekhalot literature also attest to the conscious use of this characteristic expression. Suffice it to cite here two of its occurrences, traces of which can be recognized in the Arabic “Sword.”83הבא העולם לחיי ויורש זוכה בו ומזדהר יודעו אדם אשרי אבלבקדושתו אותו יקדיש זה ברז המשתמש אדם אשרי לפיכךIn translation:But happy is the man who knows it, and takes care of it, he deserves and inherits the life of the coming world.And for this, happy is the man who uses this secret and sanctifies it in its sanctity.For the sake of comparison we can pick out the following two phrases from the Arabic text:84يفسـلا هذا سر عرف لمن ـىبفطوذلك لعارف ـىبفطوIn translation:And happy is he who knows the secret of this Sword.And happy is he who is knowing that.The first statement from the Hekhalot text is particularly interesting since it combines elements of the ashrei formula with reference to the world to come. This was the motif that appeared in the Arabic recen-sion, the origin of which could be discovered in the Babylonian Talmud 81 For its occurrences in the “Sword,” see 162, 179, 184, 194, 199f, 201, 221.82 EJ s.v. “Ashrei.”83 SHL §§ 712, 821. See also ÜdHL II, 57.

In contrast, the Arabic work and its supposed Jewish-(Aramaic) origin show again the influence of the redactor’s imposing knowledge of Rabbinic and mystical lore and his manifest insistence on using the characteristic terminology.Another type of expression interwoven in the text of the whole Arabic Sifr Ādam including the “Sword” is construed on the pattern of “God does what He wants” such as the following: Allah—tabāraka wa-taʿālā—yahdī man yašā’u (“God—May He be blessed and exalted!—guides whom He wishes”) or Allah yuʿṭī li-man yašā’u (“God gives to whom He wishes”). The background can possibly be looked for in such verses of the Psalms as 115:3 (Velohenu ba-shamayim kol-ḥafeṣ ʿasa, “Our God is in the heavens, everything He wished, He did”) or 135:6 (Kol asher-ḥafeṣ YHWH ʿasa, “Everything YHWH wished, He did”). These formulae may point again to some liturgical usage. Here, however, another consideration may offer itself for exploring a new layer in the influences that effected the Arabic revision of the Jewish source, and this may also point to the supposed Islamic connection of the redactor. Notably, one cannot ignore the parallel phrasing that connects these characteristic expressions to such almost literally iden-tical Qurʾanic verses as Allāhu yaf ʿalu ma yašā’u (Q 3:40 “God does what He wants’), wa-l-Lāhu yahdī man yašā’u (Q 2:213 “and God guides whom He wishes”) or wa-l-Lāhu yu’tī mulkahu man yašā’u (Q 2:247 “and God grants His sovereignty to whom He wishes”).The review of the influence of the liturgical elements on the magical procedure cannot be complete without indicating that the instructions given to the practitioner prescribed not only what he was supposed to recite but also what kind of bodily position he had to take. Several passages describe that the angels who minister in front of the Throne participating in the heavenly liturgy direct their faces downward as a sign of respect and humility.86 As if to imitate their position, the per-former of the magic rite is also advised to bow his head and turn his face towards the earth, and finally to prostrate himself at the end of his supplication.8785 See above, n. 14.86 See, e.g., SHL IV. § 966.87 Sifr Ādam 172, 181f, 191."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"380  alexander  fodorThe question arises: What could have been the reason for making such drastic changes in the Ḥarba de Moshe? As we have seen, the Arabic text—or better said, its Jewish source—has amply drawn on Hekhalot material and 3 Enoch. Acccording to Schäfer’s opinion, the main issue of the Hekhalot literature must be sought in the magical adjuration and not in the mystic’s heavenly journey, since the mys-tic wanted to control the “Prince of the Torah” (Sar ha-Torah) by magical means to gain perfect knowledge of the Torah and protection against forgetting it. Closely related to this was the mystic’s ambition to take part in the heavenly service centered upon the recitation of the Qedusha and hymns of praise to realize a kind of liturgical commu-nion with God.88The Ḥarba used the magical techniques and methods of the pious mystic but surpassed his primary aim by far. This meant that the ori-ginal setting came to be ignored and the knowledge of the Ineffable Name in the form of a fascinating number of nomina barbara was supposed to help the practitioner in realizing his most varied goals by pure magic. The Arabic adaptation attests that there must have been a revised version of the Ḥarba which took a further step on the way of giving the contents an even more general character when it “censored out” all the direct references that could have been related to a specific Jewish background or even to the Hekhalot literature.As a result of this purificatory zeal, such characteristic elements of the Hekhalot literature as the word hekhal itself, or merkava (“cha-riot”) together with such protagonists as Rabbi ʿAqiva, Rabbi Elʿazar, Rabbi Nehemia or Rabbi Yishmaʿel—some of which appear also in the Ḥarba—have been eliminated. Shamayim, however, represented by al-samā’ al-sābiʿa, “the Seventh Firmament,” has been given a pro-minent place in the structure of the Arabic work and its Jewish source. Similarly, as we have seen in the closing section, the reference to the Cherubs has preserved another favourite Hekhalot subject89 which did not appear in the Ḥarba in this form.As we have seen, the adjuration of the Sar ha-Panim has greatly influenced the structure of the invocations in both the Ḥarba and the Arabic “Sword”. As if to complete this picture, Ḥai Gaon’s Responsum 88 Schäfer 1993, 233f.89 See e.g. SHL § 954."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 381actually explained why such liturgical elements as the Barukh Shem had to be included in the magical procedure. The Hekhalot literature, the different redactions of the Ḥarba and the Arabic “Sword” illustrate how his description was put into practice. We have also seen that the use of these liturgical components could be interpreted in the light of the ritual on the Day of Atonement. In this respect, we might also say that the most dramatic change concerned the main protagonist of the original scene, the High Priest of the Temple liturgy. This development brought about the elimination of his role; on the other side, the change also helped to proliferate or even to “democratize” an element in the Temple liturgy—namely, the act of pronouncing the Ineffable Name by the High Priest on Yom Kippur and responding to it through the recitation of the Barukh Shem by the congregation was relegated to a new actor, the magician. This means that according to the opinion of the redactor or compiler of the text, the magician could play the role of the High Priest—and that, not only on a special occasion but at any time and at any place in case of need. Then, following this course, the role of the professional magician could have been performed by anybody else who claimed the knowledge of the Names and had the necessary expertise in using them to achieve the desired goal.This phenomenon as a sign of a kind of “democratization process” shows well the dual character of the magical act. On the one hand, it is characterized by exclusiveness because it is limited to a certain group of chosen persons, the initiates. On the other hand, however, it tends to be democratic since anybody can easily fulfill the require-ments which are necessary to be able to perform the magical rite.The structure of these names which compose the “Sword” present a further peculiarity of the Arabic version. As we have seen, the Gaon clearly distinguished two elements in the procedure of the supplica-tion: the recitation of the (Ineffable) Name and the liturgical elements which should follow it. The different prescriptions of the Arabic work, and in particular the reconstructed liturgical song of praise, show that these two independent elements have been merged together, and the originally intelligible liturgical component became part of the nomina barbara. It is worthwhile to take a look at the long history of the latter and at the process of transformations which they underwent.Hekhalot Zutarti considered the epithets in Cant 5:10–16 as Divine Names and initiated a pattern to express them in a proper form by using the word ṣeva’ot seven times as a dividing element between them,"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"382  alexander  fodorwhile the original components came to be replaced by unintelligible nomina barbara.90 As we have seen, this kind of structure appeared at the beginning of our Arabic text.91 Here we are confronted with the same phenomenon of deterioration characterized by Rohrbacher-Sticker as a tendency from “sense to nonsense.” The final phase in this process was reached when the liturgical formulae came to be incorpo-rated into the nomina barbara, that is the “Sword,” and lost every sign of their primary function or meaning in the Arabic redaction. Apart from the case discovered by Rohrbacher-Sticker, the prayer to Helios in Greek hidden behind a group of nomina barbara in Sefer ha-Razim offers the best example for this “development.”92The text tradition of the Ḥarba shows that it has undergone many changes until it reached its final form with the Arabic “Sword.” Due to the numerous connections to the main pieces of Hekhalot lite-rature and its milieu, the redactional work could most probably be traced back to the Geonic period. A seemingly very good parallel to our Arabic “Sword” could be offered by the case of another magical text, the Tefillat Rav Hamnuna Sava (“The Prayer of Rav Hamnuna Sava”).93 This Tefilla, although attributed to Rav Hamnuna Sava, a 3rd–4th century CE authority, can also be dated to the Geonic period. The apparent similarities of its structure and composing elements with those that can be detected in the “Sword” are striking. To indicate some of these basic common features, the evident importance attribu-ted to Meṭaṭron (although his name is not mentioned in the “Prayer”), the motif of the promise of the coming world to the practitioner if he fulfills certain conditions, the parallel situation between the perfor-mer’s asking for forgiveness by pronouncing the Name and the corres-ponding act of the High Priest on Yom Kippur should be pointed out.94 A substantial difference, however, between the Tefilla or the Hekhalot texts and the Ḥarba or the Arabic “Sword” is that these have been transformed to a real magical handbook representing the level of pure 90 SHL §§ 419, 951, ÜdHL III. 171, nn. 13,15. For the interpretation of this develop-ment, see Dan 1993, 36, 75, 124. 91 A similar arrangement with seven (!) ṢB’WWT-s can be found in another pas-sage in Sifr Ādam 205f. The Ḥarba has a longer list of nomina barbara with ṣeva’ot as the dividing element (Gaster 1925–28b, 76/28–77/6).92 Margalioth 1966, 12, 99f; Morgan 1983, 71.93 Herrmann 2005.94 Herrmann 2005, 202."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":" an arabic version of “the sword of moses” 383magic without giving expression to such original goals as the acquire-ment of the knowledge of the Torah or the forgiveness of sins.Summing up what has been said in the foregoing, we may state that the Jewish(-Aramaic) source of the Arabic “Sword” offers ano-ther good example for the intermingling of different elements from the Hekhalot literature, liturgy and magic. On the other hand, howe-ver, with its characteristic features it represents an independent work within the “Ḥarba de Moshe tradition.” Among its distinctive attri-butes a kind of anti-Rabbinic tendency (manifested in the censoring out of certain elements and the preference given to Meṭaṭron) should be indicated. Due to this and other specific traits, it can be clearly distinguished from the related pieces of Jewish magical literature. In this sense, the Arabic “Sword,” deprived of almost every specifically Jewish connotation, was meant to serve the needs of a wider public—whether Jews, Muslims or Christians—by offering them solutions for their everyday problems. With these developments, the Arabic version partly shows the end of a long road that Jewish magical tradition has followed, and has partly turned out to be an important channel for conveying this magical lore to the Islamic world where its influence has made itself felt for long centuries until the recent past. To be more specific on the latter point, we may even say that it might have played a decisive role in transmitting the elements of the magical cosmology which has become fundamental for Arabic magic and might have also contributed to the formation of Meṭaṭron’s formidable career in the Islamic environment.95ReferencesA.
