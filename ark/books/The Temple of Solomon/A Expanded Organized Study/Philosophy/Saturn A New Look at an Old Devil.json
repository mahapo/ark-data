Here, noted astrologer Liz Greene takes a major step in the unveiling of the light of reason, so long obscured by those who have interpreted Saturn as a ‘malefic’ planet and, in so doing, presents a remarkably rich study of the unconscious mind, shedding light on that mysterious, elusive entity that psycholog y calls the self. “Saturn symbolizes a psychic process as well as a quality or kind of experience. He is not merely a representative of pain, restriction, and discipline; he is also a symbol of the psychic process, natural to all human beings, by which an individual may utilize the experience of pain, restriction, and discipline, as a means for greater consciousness and fulfillment.” — from the book6Greene retraces Saturn’s character through sign, house, aspect, and synastry in a brilliant analysis which reveals his other face: that of the initiator who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater consciousness, self-understanding, and, eventually, freedom. 6“Liz Greene’s Saturn is one of the key works in the most important single contribution of twentieth-century astrolog y to the development of astrolog y: the idea that astrolog y is not a map of one’s fixed destiny but is a potential map of the unfolding of the authentic, higher self.” —Robert Hand, from the forewordISBN: 978-1-57863-507-8 U.S. $18.95SGreeneSATURNA New Look at an Old Devil"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"SaturnA New Lookat anOld DevilLiz Greeneforeword byRobert HandSaturn Layout Pages_08.indd 15/9/2011 10:50:36 PM45173_TXT.indd 111-06-03 12:00 PM11-06-03 15:49:45 Black45173 TXT1"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This edition first published in 1976 byRed Wheel/Weiser, llcWith offices at:665 Third Street, Suite 400San Francisco, CA 94107www.redwheelweiser.comCopyright © 1976, 2011 Liz GreeneAll rights reserved.

It was and is an important step in the progress of the twentieth century’s most crucial contribution to the evolution of astrology—namely, the use of astrology as a tool of self-realization and self-actualization.Traditional forms of astrology derived from the Middle Eastern traditions--which include Hellenistic, Jyotish, and Medieval Astrology (both in Arabic and Latin)--seem to have assumed that the basic events and circumstances of one’s life were predetermined to a significant degree, if not completely. Those Hellenistic astrolo-gers strongly influenced by Stoicism show this tendency at its most extreme. The following passage from Manilius demonstrates this:The fates rule the world, everything stands settled by law.Long seasons are marked out by causes which are fixed.As we are born, we are dying, and the end depends upon the beginning.From this both wealth and kingship flow, and, more often there arises poverty. Skills and character are granted to those thus created, also vice, praise, the losses and the gathering of things. —[Manilius, Astronomica Book IV, lines 14-19. My translation]Islamic and Christian astrologers of the middle ages gave greater scope to free will in theory, but in practice this is not obvi-ous. Also, all three traditional forms of astrology held that there were “good” and “bad” planets, which later came to be called benefics and Saturn Layout Pages_08.indd 35/9/2011 10:50:36 PM45173_TXT.indd 511-06-03 12:00 PM11-06-03 15:49:45 Black45173 TXT5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Saturn4malefics, one of which was Saturn. Benefics “caused” good destinies, malefics evil ones.However, even in the ancient world, there were voices which dissented from both of these ideas--that everything was determined at the moment of birth and that there were “good” and “bad” plan-ets--a concept which Saturn does much to undermine. The philoso-pher Plotinus (AD 204/5 –270) rejected both ideas in Enneads. His description of how the planets act could have been written by a mod-ern astrologer:We may think of the stars as letters perpetually being inscribed on the heavens or inscribed once for all and yet moving as they pursue the other tasks allotted to them: upon these main tasks will follow the quality of signifying. . . —Enneads 2.3.7, McKenna translationHe rejects the idea of good and bad planets in the following two passages:The belief is that the planets in their courses actually produce not merely such conditions as poverty, wealth, health, and sickness, but even ugliness and beauty and, gravest of all, vices and virtue and the very acts that spring from these qualities, the definite doings of each moment of virtue or vice. We are to suppose the stars to be annoyed with men—and upon matters in which men, molded to what they are by the stars themselves, can surely do them no wrong. —Enneads 2.3.1, McKenna translation[The planets are]. . . continuously serene, happy in the good they enjoy and the vision before them.

However, these passages serve to tell us that even in ancient times the “traditional” view of astrology was rejected by some, firmly, on philosophical grounds.Despite the above exceptions among the ancients and a few medi-eval philosophers who voiced similar objections, deterministic views and the idea of benefic and malefic planets dominated astrology until the twentieth century. It was the twentieth century and the astrology of the modern West which saw the overthrow of these two positions.Before Liz Greene’s work, others had taken steps--indeed large steps--in this direction, most notably the late Dane Rudhyar (1895 - 1985) and some of his followers. Even as far back as the work of Alan Leo (1860 - 1917) at the turn of the last century, one could see move-ment in this direction. But in the case of Leo, this trend was enveloped in a heavy layer of Theosophy, and it could be argued that self-actualiza-tion in Leo’s work was much more directly part of his Theosophy and only incidentally part of his astrology. One had to more or less adopt his theosophical beliefs and practices in order to use astrology for self-actualization. His Esoteric Astrology, much like the later work of the same name by Alice Bailey, considerably changed and even distorted the ancient symbolism of astrology in order to achieve its result, rather than building on that symbolism and extending it to a new purpose.Dane Rudyhar, who was a student of Bailey’s, took the next step and used the true and authentic ancient symbolism of astrology as it was to describe astrology as a tool of self-actualization. Works such as his Astrology of Personalitycombined Bailey’s insights, along with others gained from the psychology of Freud and Jung, to make it clear that astrology could move from its medieval heritage of predicting events and the external circumstances of life to reveal an understand-ing of the inner processes of the soul. Rudyhar explored how these influenced the individual’s life and, more importantly, how an under-standing of these could give one freedom and self-determination; he also roundly attacked the idea of benefic and malefic planets. I do not mean to take away from Rudhyar’s value as an author and the importance of his work in what I am about to say. His work was written in language that was often obscure, abstract and very the-oretical. His material gave one hope that it was possible to transcend any particular astrological manifestation, but it did not offer any con-crete ways to do this. It was for the next generation of astrologers to Saturn Layout Pages_08.indd 55/9/2011 10:50:36 PM45173_TXT.indd 711-06-03 12:00 PM11-06-03 15:49:46 Black45173 TXT7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Saturn6begin to accomplish this task. Liz Greene’s Saturn was an important contribution to this work.The format of the book is actually rather traditional. Superficially it appears to be a conventional handbook of delinea-tions. It takes up Saturn’s influence in the signs and houses, and in aspect to the other planets. I can say without taking away from Liz Greene’s accomplishment in this work that this was not an original arrangement; many handbooks of astrological delineations before did the same thing. But this more or less conventional way of organiz-ing the material was exactly what was needed to fill the gap between Rudhyar’s powerful but abstract descriptions and the needs of a seeker trying to find out what to do with his or her natal chart. However, I must raise a bit of a quibble here, regarding the practice of equating the symbolism of planets in the houses with the symbolism of planets in the corresponding signs. For example, fol-lowing this belief, , Saturn in Aries acts like Saturn in the first house, Saturn in Taurus acts like Saturn in the second house, and so forth. Older, pre-modern astrology may be philosophically and spiritually limited, but its symbolic vocabulary is huge and rich. This equating of sign and house positions was never done except in melothesia, the assignment of signs and houses to parts of the body (Aries and first related to the head, Taurus and second relate to the throat, etc.) Signs and houses are very different kinds of symbolic entities, having very different functions. To equate them in this manner, I believe, is to con-fuse two very different symbol systems.But even given my objection, I do not believe this is a great flaw in Saturn because Liz Greene’s emphasis here is clearly on the house placement over the sign placement and for this purpose the delinea-tions are masterful. The references to sign placement, even if signs and houses could be equated, would have to be of less value for the simple reason that Saturn spends two and a half years in a sign, and about two hours each day in a house. The house placements of a planet are much more characteristic of the individual person while the sign placements describe all persons born over an extended period of time.The nature of the book’s descriptions of the combinations of Saturn with signs, houses, and other planets set it apart from the “cook-book” approach of previous works. It is not that Greene’s descriptions are more “accurate” (as if one could make a precise forecast of exactly how a planet will manifest in each setting). It is a matter of providing Saturn Layout Pages_08.indd 65/9/2011 10:50:36 PM45173_TXT.indd 811-06-03 12:00 PM11-06-03 15:49:46 Black45173 TXT8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Foreword7descriptions which enlarge the capacity of the individual to take con-trol of his or her life. Instead of fully developed prescriptions for what will happen, the reader is presented with a range of arguments derived from the combination of symbols and then shown how changes in consciousness and self-awareness can completely turn life manifesta-tions around, turning those that are potentially difficult more creative and fulfilling. Her descriptions are not mere “optimistic” descriptions of possibilities that ignore the downside, but are instead descriptions of the work that an individual needs to do in order to make creative changes. Greene does not avoid describing the realizations that must occur and tasks to be undertaken. It all requires a change in con-sciousness and increased self-awareness. Here is an example from her description of Saturn in the sixth house:When a man is relatively unconscious, Saturn [in the sixth] may be symbolic of discontent and resentment because he may be aware only of the fact that he is in a rut and that he is imprisoned by circumstances. . . .Yet the meaning of the routine escapes him because he does not truly understand the meaning of service. . . It is said in esoteric teaching that service, rather than being “good works”, is an innate quality of the inner man . . . Service of this kind is the result of inner integration for once the body and feelings and mind of a man are in balance, he can then begin to become aware, intuitively, of the purpose and nature of his inner psyche. . . Service which is the result of inner balance is the potential result of Saturn in the sixth house when he is expressing in a conscious way. —[page 44 in the 1976 edition]As mentioned previously, even in medieval astrology it was recognized that free will can alter an astrological indication. But this belief was largely for religious reasons. If one did not have freedom of will, then the freedom to choose salvation could not exist. It would have made God, not the individual responsible for the individual’s success or failure in achieving salvation through the planets. . But while medieval astrologers paid lip service to this idea, it did not lead Saturn Layout Pages_08.indd 75/9/2011 10:50:36 PM45173_TXT.indd 911-06-03 12:00 PM11-06-03 15:49:46 Black45173 TXT9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Saturn8them to show how astrological influences could be modified by an act of will. It is not even very clear that they believed it could be done.Saturn led the way in one of the triumphs of modern astrology in showing that a combination of acceptance, understanding, and the ability to perceive alternative choiceswith increased awareness is the variable that can change the way in which one experiences one’s chart and one’s life. And here is an important point! I firmly believe, and I believe that this book points to this, that the level of consciousness with which one approaches one’s own life is not fixed or determined by whatever the birth chart signifies. One’s potential level of self-aware-ness is not fated! It may be very difficult to change one’s consciousness as circumstances—family, friends, one’s cultural background— may seem to work against it at times, but it is always possible.The choice of Saturn as the subject of this book was superb. Liz Greene has subsequently written several other similar works on other planets. But Saturn was the best place to begin precisely because Saturn is the planet that has most seemed to restrict freedom and fix destiny to astrologers. Many astrologers have seen Saturn as the planet of “karma” in the false but common sense of the word often used in the West, i.e., as the distributer of an inevitable fate handed out as punishment or reward for deeds done in the pastor in previous lifetimes. That even Saturn’s energy can be altered by the proper degree of wisdom and understanding opens up a way of seeing all of astrology in the same light. It is not necessary for one to go on an extreme spiri-tual path, to abandon one’s life in the world and take up the begging bowl to achieve this. Greene shows in countless examples how smaller “enlightenments” are available to us all if we approach things with the proper understanding. In traditional astrology Saturn was called the “greater malefic” (Mars being the “lesser”). Being the worse of the two traditional “malefics,” Saturn, makes it clear that this could be done with all of the symbols of the chart. In this way Liz Greene’s Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil has become one of the key works in this most important contribution of twentieth century astrology to the development of astrology and the idea that astrology is not a map of one’s fixed destiny, but a poten-tial map of the unfolding of the authentic, higher self.Robert Hand April 2011Saturn Layout Pages_08.indd 85/9/2011 10:50:36

Here, noted astrologer Liz Greene takes a major step in the unveiling of the light of reason, so long obscured by those who have interpreted Saturn as a ‘malefic’ planet and, in so doing, presents a remarkably rich study of the unconscious mind, shedding light on that mysterious, elusive entity that psycholog y calls the self. “Saturn symbolizes a psychic process as well as a quality or kind of experience. He is not merely a representative of pain, restriction, and discipline; he is also a symbol of the psychic process, natural to all human beings, by which an individual may utilize the experience of pain, restriction, and discipline, as a means for greater consciousness and fulfillment.” — from the book6Greene retraces Saturn’s character through sign, house, aspect, and synastry in a brilliant analysis which reveals his other face: that of the initiator who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater consciousness, self-understanding, and, eventually, freedom. 6“Liz Greene’s Saturn is one of the key works in the most important single contribution of twentieth-century astrolog y to the development of astrolog y: the idea that astrolog y is not a map of one’s fixed destiny but is a potential map of the unfolding of the authentic, higher self.” —Robert Hand, from the forewordISBN: 978-1-57863-507-8 U.S. $18.95SGreeneSATURNA New Look at an Old Devil"}]
