This is the right place to express my gratitude to the founder of theChair, Rosalie Basten, for all the things that she has done, through the years,to enable this field of research to flourish. Next to her, I wish to thank theother members and former members of the Foundation (Willem Koudijs,Frans Tilman, Sijbolt Noorda, Roelof van den Broek, Ernestine van derWall, Karel van der Toorn, Jan Bremmer, and Pieter van Onzenoort) fortheir continuing support.Secondly, I want to thank my colleagues (permanent Staff and Ph.D.candidates) at the Center for History of Hermetic Philosophy and RelatedCurrents: Marco Pasi, Peter J.

But wewould not be able to define what it is, and are at a loss about what to call it. Ithas many names, but none of them seems to have a clear and straightforwardmeaning, and each carries associations that are somehow questionableor confusing. And yet, all these names – “esotericism,” “hermeticism,”“the occult,” “magic,” “mysticism,” “superstition,” “the irrational,” andso on – refer to something that unquestionably seems to exist, in ourhistory and all around us. Bookshops have special sections devoted to it,artists and poets claim to be inspired by it, theologians warn against itsdangers. We are bound to come across its representatives or its ideas whenwe are studying the sources of our cultural past, or just while readinga popular magazine or watching television. And whenever that happens,most of us are at least dimly aware of an emotional response of somekind: discomfort, irritation, amusement, contempt, or perhaps some vaguefeeling of curiosity, puzzlement, even excitement. What we donotdo, oronly very rarely, is take a persistent look at it and ask ourselves questionsabout what we see. What is all this, really? Where does it come from? Howdoes it all hang together? What is it doing in our society and our history?And why is it that we tend to smile about it, feel embarrassed, or look theother way?The generic “we” in the above refers primarily, although not exclusively,to intellectuals and academics like myself. Questions of this kind haveoccupied me since the day, during my years as an undergraduate student,when I came across a book by a German scholar, Will-Erich Peuckert.It was titledPansophie, and dealt with a range of early modern authors1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2Introduction:Hic sunt draconesI had never heard of before: a platonic philosopher (Marsilio Ficino), anauthor on magic (Cornelius Agrippa), a rebellious physician (Paracelsus),a cobbler given to visions (Jacob B ̈ohme), and many others. I learnedabout their ideas, which turned out to be complex, unusual, and locatedin some hard-to-define no-man’s-land between philosophy, religion, litera-ture, art, and science. And it became clear that, far from being marginaloutsiders, they had been remarkably influential in their own time, andstood at the origin of large and complex intellectual traditions that couldbe traced through the centuries and even up to our own time. In short, anunknown world opened up for me. Why had I never come across all of thisbefore?I was intrigued, and wanted to learn more, so I asked my professorsfor advice. And that is when I began having my first experiences with aphenomenon that has ultimately led me to write this book. My interestin this domain seemed to make my teachers uncomfortable, and to myrepeated requests for information and suggestions, they responded by toss-ing the embarrassing topic on to another colleague as if it were a hot potato.Nobody seemed willing to touch it, and it did not take me very long todecide that if this were the case, then somebody had to do it. This is howI began my explorations of an unknown continent that seldom appearedon the maps of respectable learning, except with a negative travel adviceattached to it:hic sunt dracones. Few guidebooks were available, and evenfewer proved reliable. With only rare exceptions, scholars who had madeserious ventures into this unknown territory had stayed in only one of itstowns or provinces, refusing to go anywhere else, and many were those whoclaimed profound knowledge about it without having learned even just oneof its languages. Almost nobody had attempted to map the continent asa whole, however provisorily, and the very few who had tried disagreedabout its very boundaries.Over the past twenty years, the situation has begun to improve. Atthe time when I began exploring it, there was exactly one academic chairdevoted to this continent of learning as a whole, and no university programwhere students could study it as part of a regular curriculum. At the timeof writing, there are at least three, all in Europe: still a very modest number,especially if one considers the vastness of the terrain, but an encouragingbeginning that promises more to come. Several academic journals andlearned societies, countless international conferences, and great numbersof articles and books demonstrate that what used to be, arguably, thesingle largest stretch ofterra incognitain modern academic research is now"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introduction:Hic sunt dracones3attracting scholars in ever greater numbers. They even seem to have agreedabout what to call it: Western esotericism.In this book I make no attempt to provide a map of the domain, orwrite its history. Instead, I have set out to write the history of how scholarsand intellectuals haveimaginedit, ever since the time that its contoursfirst began to be drawn by those who claimed to know of its existence.It is only through their eyes that we will be introduced to it here, and itwill quickly become apparent that many of those who have confidentlydescribed its nature – sometimes as a lost paradise, sometimes as a darkrealm filled with demons, or a resort of fools – have been projecting theirown hopes or fears onto it, or have just been repeating what others saidabout it. But no matter how extravagant the claims that have been madeabout this continent, one thing is clear: it has always been considered thedomain ofthe Other. It has been imagined as a strange country, whoseinhabitants think differently from us and live by different laws: whetherone felt that it should be conquered and civilized, avoided and ignored, oremulated as a source of inspiration, it has always presented a challenge toour very identity, for better or worse. We seldom realize it, but in tryingto explain who “we” are and what we stand for, we have been at pains topoint out that we are not likethem. In fact, we still do.How much truth there is to these perceptions of otherness is an openquestion, which I will not try to answer directly. What must be empha-sized, however, is that our perceptions of “esotericism” or “the occult” areinextricably entwined with how we think about ourselves: although weare almost never conscious of the fact, our very identity as intellectualsor academics depends on an implicit rejection of that identity’s reversemirror image. It is for this reason that the field of “Western esotericism”has potentially explosive implications for academic research as a whole. Ifour inherited assumptions about it prove to be inadequate, because theyare reflective of ideological constructs and stereotypes rather than unprej-udiced investigation of the historical record, then we will be obliged toreconsider the foundations of our own identity. Our imaginal constructsof esoteric or occult otherness are simultaneously constructs of ourselves,and therefore if “they” turn out to be different, the question is what doesthis imply about us.In short: setting out to explore the blank spaces on the maps of learningand confront their dragons is a dangerous business. It will affect us possiblybeyond recognition, and should do so: if we return from our expeditionsunchanged, this means that the dragons have won. In this book we will"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4Introduction:Hic sunt draconesbe following a range of scholars who made the attempt, with greater orlesser degrees of success.

Thegrand Renaissance project of recovering the sources of classical antiquityand its philosophical traditions forced Christian thinkers to reconsiderbasic questions concerning the relation between human rationality anddivine revelation, and stimulated them to trace the historical origins andchronological development of both. However, at a time when critical neu-trality had not yet emerged as a historiographical ideal, any such historyhad to be based upon theological and metaphysical premises and assumethe shape of ahistory of truth: it was not expected merely to discuss thevarious opinions of earlier thinkers, but rather, to demonstrate the sourcesof true knowledge and wisdom, trace the paths they had followed throughtime, and make clear how those trajectories harmonized or coincided withthe unquestionable truth of Christian doctrine. This Renaissance project,generally recognized as central to the history of Renaissance hermeticism1See the monumental history of the history of philosophy edited by Giovanni Santinello,Storia dellestorie generali della filosofia;vol.itranslated into English, under the general editorship of C. W. T.Blackwell, as Bottinet al.,Models of the History of Philosophy. See there esp. Malusa, “RenaissanceAntecedents,”4, and the bibliography on p.59. See also, for example, Spini, “Historiography,”92–93; Copenhaver and Schmitt,Renaissance Philosophy,332. That the history of philosophy originatedin the Italian Renaissance was emphasized as early as1888by Ludwig Stein in the first issue ofArchiv f ̈ur Geschichte der Philosophie, in an article that contained a full transcript of anEpistola . . . deNobilioribus philosophorum sectis et de eorum inter se differentia(1458, addressed to Marsilio Ficino),by Johannes Baptista Buonosegnius, “the first modern historiographer of philosophy” (Stein, “Hand-schriftenfunde”; cf.

But such questions are inspired by a secular devel-opment of historical consciousness that was still alien to the Renaissancehumanists who will be discussed in this chapter: for them, metaphysi-cal verities grounded in divine revelation were the self-evident foundationfor intellectual inquiry, and there was not yet any compelling reason to seethem as incompatible with the business of historiography. Although we cannow see these Italian intellectuals as having made the first tentative stepsin a direction that would eventually lead towards the history of philosophyas an autonomous discipline2(while also laying some early foundations forthe future development of another one, the comparative study of ancientreligions),3it is of the utmost importance to emphasize that their essentialproject was not historiographical in our sense of the word, but doctrinaland theological throughout: in studying the ancient wisdom discourse4of the Renaissance, we will be dealing with a species of Christian apolo-getic theology5that derived its vigor and its religious urgency from theintellectual challenge posed by the newly discovered “pagan” literature.The overall argument of this chapter is that this Renaissance projectresulted in the emergence of a powerful grand narrative which seriouslychallenged traditional perspectives on the relation between philosophy andtheology, or rationality and revelation, and remained a highly importantfactor in Roman Catholic thought until its decline under the influenceof the “anti-apologetic” discourse developed by Protestant authors duringthe seventeenth century (the main topic ofChapter2). After the victoryof anti-apologeticism during the eighteenth century, this grand narrative2Malusa, “Renaissance Antecedents,”14–25(section “‘Prisca Theologia’ and ‘Perennis Philosophia’”).The pioneering importance of Renaissance platonism, and Agostino Steuco in particular, for thehistoriography of philosophy was highlighted by Otto Willmann as early as1894(Geschichte desIdealismusiii,126–154).3Kohl, “Geschichte der Religionswissenschaft,”227–229.4In what follows, I will adopt the convention of using the term “discourse” for the entirety ofdiscussions about ancient wisdom, whether by defenders or opponents, and “narrative” for theperspectives of the defenders only. In other words, the narratives of those who wished to defend theancient wisdom gave rise to a complex apologetic/polemical discourse.5As emphasized by Walker in the opening sentence of his classic study on theprisca theologiatradition:“By the term ‘Ancient Theology’ I mean a certain tradition of Christian apologetic literature whichrests on misdated texts” (Walker,Ancient Theology,1)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Competing macrohistories7of “ancient wisdom” survived as a widespread but officially discreditedcountercurrent at odds with mainstream intellectual thought. It has beenaccepted or implied, in one version or another, by most of the authors andpractitioners studied under the umbrella of Western esotericism, up to thepresent; but, interestingly, it has also strongly influenced the thinking evenof the most important modern scholars who have shaped and developedthat field. Were these scholars attracted by the ancient wisdom narrativein spite of its incompatibility with post-Enlightenment intellectual andacademic culture or, rather,becauseof it? As the narrative unfolds, we willsee that in addressing such questions, we get to the heart of what is at stakein the modern and contemporary study of Western esotericism.The story that will be told here is one of apologetic and polemical battlesand negotiations over the “wisdom of the pagans,” and their continuationsor reverberations right into the present: a story with winners and losers,but without a final victory in sight. Moreover, it will be argued, notonly do we see the complex processes of secularization and modernizationreflected in this story at each and every turn, but, far more importantly, thebattle between the apologists of “ancient wisdom” and their anti-apologeticenemies hasshapedanddeterminedthe emergence of modernity to an extentthat has rarely been recognized.competing macrohistoriesMuch has been written about the “ancient theology” or “perennial philos-ophy” of the Renaissance,6but, surprisingly, there have been almost noattempts to be precise about definitions or think systematically about therelation between the two central termsprisca theologia(first used by Mar-silio Ficino and “launched” into scholarly debate in1954)7andphilosophia6The most important general discussions (in chronological order) are Walker, “Prisca TheologiainFrance”; Wind,Pagan Mysteries,chapter1(“Poetic Theology”); Schmitt, “Perennial Philosophy”;Facolt`a . . .

P. Walker claimed to have “launched” the term in1954(Ancient Theology,1n.1, referring to hisgroundbreaking “Prisca Theologiain France”), but it appears literally in Marsilio Ficino’s writings,for example “De laudibus philosophiae” (Opera,768:“PriscaveraAegyptiorumetArabumtheolo-gia”); Argumentum to thePimander;orDe Christiana religione22(Opera,25: “Prisca GentiliumTheologia”)."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8The history of truthperennis(introduced by Agostino Steuco and put on the agenda of Renais-sance historiography in1966).8The only notable exception is the historianof Renaissance philosophy Charles B. Schmitt, who in an Italian article of1970called attention to the fact that the notion of an “ancient” wisdomis different from that of a “perennial” one, both in its contents and itsimplications:The concept ofprisca theologiaindicates that the true knowledge would beanterior to Greek philosophy and would actually be found, although perhaps inan enigmatic and esoteric form, among the pre-classical sages such as Zoroaster,Mercurius Trismegistus, and Orpheus. Usually it is thought that, directly orindirectly, they had derived their wisdom from Moses, and therefore they assumeda high level of authority within the Jewish–Christian tradition. From this pointof view thesapientia, having been developed among theprisci, or ancient sages,passed on to the Greeks by way of the platonic current: that is to say, fromOrpheus to Aglaophemus to Pythagoras and, finally, to Plato.9From such a perspective, the rediscovery and translation not only of theworks of Plato, but also of writings attributed to Zoroaster, Hermes andOrpheus in the later fifteenth century, had to be a momentous eventresonating with millenarian overtones.10For the first time in history, andat a time when the moral degeneration of the Church was becoming moreobvious every day, Christians had unexpectedly been granted access tothe most ancient and therefore most authoritative sources of true religionand philosophy: surely the hand of Providence was at work here, showinghumanity a way towards the needed reformation of Christian faith bymeans of a return to the very sources of divine revelation.We will see that Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), the virtual founder of theRenaissanceprisca theologianarrative, indeed believed that in translatingHermes, Orpheus, Plato and the later platonists he was acting as God’schosen instrument.11However, in a penetrating analysis of his perspective,Michael J. B. Allen has warned against too easy associations between theconcept ofprisca theologiaand that ofphilosophia perennis, linked to thename of Agostino Steuco.12Charles B. Schmitt, too, had called attentionto the differences:8The term was introduced in1540by Agostino Steuco,De perenni philosophia, and put on the agendaof Renaissance scholarship by Charles B. Schmitt in1966(“Perennial Philosophy”).9Schmitt, “Prisca TheologiaePhilosophia Perennis,”212–213(“scienza” is translated here as “knowl-edge”).10Ibid.,213.11Allen,Synoptic Art,14,17–18. Cf. also Malusa, “Renaissance Antecedents,”52.12Allen,Synoptic Art,42."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Competing macrohistories9thephilosophia perennis...would seem to have larger implications. It likewisemakes wisdom originate in a very ancient time, often applying the same genealogyof the transmission ofsapientialike theprisca theologia, but it also puts emphasison the continuity of valid knowledge through all periods of history. It does notbelievethatknowledge...haseverbeenlostforcenturies,butbelievesthatitcansurely be found in each period, albeit sometimes in attenuated form.13This second perspective strongly emphasizes the unity and universalityof wisdom, rather than its decline, and therefore lacks the millenarianimplications of Ficino’s outlook. It seems significant that Agostino Steucopublished his grand synthesisDe perenni philosophiain1540,onlyafewyears before the Council of Trent: while the Roman Catholic adherents ofprisca theologiaand the new Protestant theologians both wanted to reformthe Church by means of a return to what each of them saw as its originsand foundations, Steuco’s grand synthesis did not seek to reform but topreserve. It did so by strongly affirming the unity and universality of theone, perennial faith, very much in line with a perspective that had beenproclaimed in the strongest possible wordings even by St. Augustine: “Thevery thing which is now called the Christian religion was with the ancients,and it was with the human race from its beginning to the time whenChrist appeared in the flesh: from when on the true religion, which alreadyexisted, began to be called the Christian.”14What we find, therefore, is astrong tension between two opposed tendencies: on the one hand, a his-torically/chronologically oriented narrative of ancient wisdom which heldconsiderable revolutionary potential, and, on the other, an essentially con-servative doctrine which preaches the futility of change and developmentby emphasizing the trans-historical continuity and universality of absolutetruth.Still, this is not all. If we further unpack the Renaissance discourse onancient wisdom, we may even distinguish a third, “prophetic” tendency:this one claims that, due to divine inspiration, the ancient philosophersbefore Christ had been granted prophetic glimpses into the superior reli-gion of Christianity.15Such a third option, which might conveniently bereferred to aspia philosophia,16introduces an element of “progress”: whereas13Schmitt, “Prisca TheologiaePhilosophia Perennis,”213.14Augustine,Retractationesi.12.3(trans. Wind,Pagan Mysteries,21).15With regard to this third option, I am grateful to Jean-Pierre Brach for his fruitful suggestionsduring a train journey from Strasbourg to Paris in October2008.16There is an element of convenience in the use ofallthree terminologies. We already saw that theexact termprisca theologiais used so rarely in the Renaissance that Walker thought he had inventedit (see n.7). The termphilosophia perenniswas invented by Steuco, but Schmitt expresses surpriseat how rarely it is actually used in hisDe perenni philosophia(“Perennial Philosophy,”522); and,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10The history of truththeprisca theologiacombines a narrative of decline with hopes of immi-nent revival, andphilosophia perennisemphasizes continuity,pia philosophiathinks in terms of growth and development, imagining a gradual “educa-tion of humanity” to prepare it for the final revelation.If we wish to do justice to the full complexity of the ancient wisdomdiscourse, this third tendency must be clearly recognized. And yet, its actualrelevance to Renaissance culture remains relatively limited. Contrary to thetwo other perspectives, it concerned a period that had ended with the birthof Christ, and therefore had little social or political relevance for the present:neither revolutionary nor conservative in its implications, it amounted tolittle more than a historical opinion concerning a time that now belongedto the remote past.17It could certainly offer some theological support forantiquarian studies of pre-Christian sources, but lacked political potentialin the tense religious climate of Renaissance society. However – and thisis an important point – adherents of theprisca theologiaperspective couldand did evoke it rhetorically, to counter criticisms that their narrative ofancient decline and contemporary recovery left no room for explaininghow the advent of Christianity had been a step forward in the history oftruth.In sum: the concepts ofprisca theologiaandphilosophia perennisaremost central to the ancient wisdom discourse of the Renaissance, but,to avoid simplification, we need to keep thepia philosophiaoption con-stantly in mind. From a systematic perspective, then, the problem inherentin this discourse was that it somehow encompassed no fewer than threemutually exclusive macrohistorical schemes: evolution, degeneration, andironically, it only became famous after having been divorced from its original meaning, by Leibnizin1714(letter to Remond of August26,1714; see Schmitt, “Perennial Philosophy,”506,532;seebelow, page130), after which it embarked upon a new career in a variety of new contexts, includingneo-scholastic theology and the East/West philosophy of Aldous Huxley (see references in Schmitt,“Perennial Philosophy,”505–506). Likewise,pia philosophiais merely one option among manysimilar terms that were used at the time, such as, for example,prisca sapientia,christiana philosophia,mosaica philosophia,caelestis philosophia,vetus theologia, and evennova theologia(see Di Napoli,“Il concetto di ‘philosophia perennis’,”266–268).17There are exceptions even to this: the hermetic philosopher Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500) devel-oped a variation on the ancient wisdom narrative that implied progress from the ancient revelationof wisdom given by Poimandres to Hermes long before the time of Moses, via the incarnation ofPoimandres as Jesus Christ, to the final return of Christ/Poimandres in the person of his spiritualteacher Giovanni “Mercurio” da Correggio (see Hanegraaff, “Lodovico Lazzarelli and the HermeticChrist,”47,95–96). However, this radical doctrine was intentionally concealed by Lazzarelli, andcan only be reconstructed today by close textual comparison of the various manuscripts. It notablyinfluenced Cornelius Agrippa, who adopted Lazzarelli’s identification of Poimandres with Christ,but not his adherence to Correggio (Agrippa,Oratio habita Papiae[Zambelli ed.],125; see discussionin Hanegraaff, “Better than Magic”)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Competing macrohistories11continuity.18The evolutionary or educational perspective, which appreci-ated ancient wisdom only as apraeparatio evangelica, was most obviouslyorthodox but implicitly minimized the relevance of studying the newly dis-covered sources: as a matter of principle, anything of value that they mightcontain was believed to be expressed more fully and clearly by Christiantheology, and anything not included in it had to be pagan error by defini-tion. Starting from a very similar assumption of Christian doctrine as theself-evident truth, the perspective ofphilosophia perennisemphasized itsuniversality, sometimes to the point of embracing a perspective of “every-one is right,” but the implication was, again, that study of the new sourcescould not possibly yield any new insights, but could only provide evermore confirmation of truths already known. If, however, the most ancientauthors had been closest to the truth, as suggested by theprisca theologiaperspective, this implied an exciting promise of new discoveries, and gavevital importance to the study of the ancient writings; but by implication,the chronologically more recent Christian faith risked becoming irrelevantor superfluous at best, and a phenomenon of decline at worst. Critics hadtherefore good reasons to fear that the new sources might turn out tobe a Trojan horse: rather than pointing towards a reform of Christianity,did they not instead contain the seeds of its destruction and its futurereplacement by a revived universal pagan religion?That the ancient wisdom narrative is constituted of no fewer than threemacrohistorical models, each with their own implications and internallogic, may have been a weakness theoretically, but could be an advantagein practice. The very ambiguity of the narrative gave it a peculiar flex-ibility: it allowed authors – provided they possessed sufficient eruditionand rhetorical skill – to have recourse to different apologetic strategies atdifferent times or to mix elements taken from all three models, and therebyelude their critics almost forever in a never-ending maze of references tounquestionable authorities.In addition, what made the narrative even harder to pin down wasits ambiguous relation to both theology and philosophy. This is alreadyclear, of course, from the very terminologies that were used: the ancienttheologianshad actually beenphilosophers, but the perennialphilosophywasthe basic doctrine of a universalreligion. Tools sharp enough to reallykeep the ancient theology apart from philosophy were not developed untilthe emergence of Protestant anti-apologeticism in the later seventeenthcentury, as will be seen.

Rather,in the late Hellenistic world, platonism was transformed by them into areligious worldview with its own mythologies and ritual practices, focusedon the attainment of a salvational gn ̄osis by which the soul could be lib-erated from its material entanglement and regain its unity with the divineMind.20Allowing for the great differences between various systems, this iswhat the gnostic, hermetic, and theurgical currents of late antiquity all hadin common; and to an extent that has not always been sufficiently recog-nized, this is what platonism came to mean for its Renaissance admirers.2119Brown,World of Late Antiquity,73.20As formulated by Majercik, with reference to John Dillon’s concept of an “Underworld of Platonism”(see text): “This movement away from the school traditions of Platonism towards an unabashedreligiosity is the hallmark of these systems” and “knowledge for its own sake passes over to ‘gnosis’for the sake ofsoteria, with spiritual enlightenment often coupled with magic and ritual as a meansof freeing the soul” (Majercik, “Introduction,”4–5). For typologies and general characterizations ofthe middle-platonic milieu, see Dillon,Middle Platonists,396; Majercik, “Introduction,”4(analyzedin detail by Burns, “\u0002\u0003\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 \b\t\u0006\u0007 \u0005\u000b\b\f\r\u0006\u0007,”64–112); and Nock, “Pr ́eface,” vii.

Thus, in his standard workThe Middle Platonists,John Dillon discussed them under the telling rubric “Some Loose Ends,”and referred to this “murky area” as the “Underworld of Platonism” dom-inated by “sub-philosophical phenomena”:22although their existence hadto be recognized, the philosophical inferiority of their occult speculationswas clearly taken for granted. Likewise, when the great French scholarAndr ́e-Jean Festugi`ere discussed the same milieu in the introduction to hisclassic study of late antique hermetism, he saw no reason to conceal his dis-taste for the superstitious pseudo-philosophies that marked the “decline ofrationalism” in the late Hellenistic world.23And if modern scholars notedthat the Syrian platonist Iamblichus of Chalcis introduced theurgical ritesinto neoplatonism, they have tended to dismiss this as a “corruption ofthe tradition” or an “irresoluble enigma,” while ignoring the fact thatIamblichus’ approach was far more typical of neoplatonism as a culturalphenomenon than the non-ritual philosophy of Plotinus, which remaineda relative exception.24To understand the historical origins of the ancient wisdom narrative, weneed to overcome such normative biases, which judge religious practicesand speculations by the unsuitable yardstick of rational philosophy andanachronistically project modern stereotypes of “the occult” back into theancient past.25At the same time, we must take care not to fall from oneerror into another, namely that of denying serious philosophical contentto these traditions, merely because they are now classified as “religious” or,even worse, “occult”: that most of the neoplatonists practiced or at leastendorsed theurgy obviously does not disqualify them as philosophers, andrepresentatives of the anti-magical reaction, as will be seen. The first apology of gnosticism, Abrahamvon Franckenberg’sTheophrastia Valentiniana, dates from the seventeenth century (written in1627,first published in1703: see Gilly, “Das Bekenntnis zur Gnosis,”416–422), and of course the NagHammadi Library crucial to our current understanding of “gnosticism” was still lying undiscoveredin an Egyptian cave.22Dillon,Middle Platonists,384(followed by short analyses of Valentinian gnosticism, the hermeticPoimandres,andtheChaldaean Oracles).

Festugi`erepointsustowardsa better alternative in one of his introductory chapters, “Les Proph`etes del’Orient,” which begins with a characteristic passage by the second-centuryPythagorean Numenius of Apamea:On this point [i.e. the problem of God], after having cited and taken notice ofPlato’s testimonies, one should go further back and connect them to the teachingsof Pythagoras, calling next upon the peoples of high renown so as to include theirinitiations, dogmas and cultural foundations, which they accomplish in full accordwith Plato, in short, to all on which the Brahmans, the Jews, theMagiand theEgyptians were in agreement.26Far from being an isolated instance, this statement was utterly typicalof the period: there are innumerable references27to the ruling idea thatthe most ancient “barbarian” peoples possessed a pure and superior sci-ence and wisdom, derived not from reason but from direct mysticalaccess to the divine,28and that all the important Greek philosophersup to and including Plato had received their “philosophy” from thesesources. The modalities of such transmission were not seen as problem-atic: after all, countless testimonies confirmed that Plato himself and allhis notable predecessors had personally traveled to Egypt, Babylon, Per-sia and even India, where they had studied with the priests and sages.29In short, not only was Greek philosophy seen as derived from oriental26Numenius,\u000e\f\u0003\u000f \u0010\u0011\u0011\u0012\u0006\u0013,Bk.i,frag.1a (des Places ed.,42).

More than anything, he was looking for “a philosophy without schools or factions, and,one might add, without history: a wisdom modeled after the transcendent God, which, like him,would remain above time, residing in the peace of an absolute immutability” (ibid.,767).27Festugi`ere,R ́ev ́elation d’Herm`es Trism ́egistei,20, and see the many testimonies discussed in the restof the chapter.28As formulated by Festugi`ere (R ́ev ́elation d’Herm`es Trism ́egistei,20): “The ruling idea was that theBarbarians possessed purer and more essential notions concerning the Divine, not because they usedtheir reason better than the hellenes but, on the contrary, because, neglecting reason, they had foundways of communicating with God by more secret means.” For the larger historical development ofthis idea, see D ̈orrie, “Wertung der Barbaren.”29The many late antique references are conveniently listed in Hopfner,Orient und griechische Philoso-phie,1–9; and see the discussion of sources in D ̈orrie, “Platons Reisen zu fernen V ̈olkern.” The veryearliest source for Greek “philosophical tourism” in Egypt is Hecataeus of Abdera (fourth century),much of whose work, while no longer extant in the original, survives in the first book of DiodorusSiculus’Bibliotheca Historica(1.10–98).

Zoroaster was a Persian sage who had probably livedsome six millennia earlier. Some of his writings still existed, showing that he wasa great authority on astrology. He had something to do with the Chaldaeans, forPythagoras met him or his disciples in Babylonia. Other works of theMagishowedthat the ancient Persians had mastered the occult sciences.32Very similar assumptions were common about Hermes Trismegistus as thegreatest Egyptian wise man, and about the legendary sages of various otherancient nations. The thesis of a continuity between Plato’s philosophy andthe ancient “barbarian” peoples could even claim some support from Platohimself33and from scattered references to a lost work of Aristotle.34Fur-ther confirmation came from authoritative Greek and Roman historians,30Hopfner,Orient und griechische Philosophie,8.31Walbridge,Wisdom of the Mystic East,x,2–3,8–12. “Platonic Orientalism” is a new coinage,independent of the famous work of Edward Said. For the present discussion it is not necessary toexplore the nature of the relation between these two theoretical frameworks.32Ibid.,7. For an exhaustive study of how Zoroaster and theMagiwere perceived in Greek and Latinliterature, see de Jong,Traditions of the Magi.33Alcibiadesi, 122a, where Socrates refers to Zoroaster’smageiaas “the worship of the gods.” Whilethe authenticity of the dialogue is contested today (but defended in the thorough recent discussionby Denyer, “Introduction,”14–26), Plato’s authorship was never doubted in antiquity. As pointedout by de Jong, the fragment is quoted in a “surprisingly large number of classical passages”(“Contribution of the Magi,”86, referring to the list of references in de Jong,Traditions of the Magi,213n.29). A particularly important reference is Apuleius,Pro Se De Magia25–26(Hunink ed.,54;cf. de Jong, “Contribution,”85–86).34Judging from two references in Diogenes Laertius and Joannes Philoponus (Fragments6–7,in:[Aristotle],Complete Worksii,2390), Aristotle’s “On Philosophy” may have been one of the firstattempts at a genealogy of wisdom, transmitted from the PersianMagito Egypt, and from thereto the most ancient Greek “theologians,” Orpheus, and the fabled “Seven Sages.” See discussionin Festugi`ere,R ́ev ́elation d’Herm`es Trism ́egistei,22;Droge,Homer or Moses?,14–15;andBywater,“Aristotle’s Dialogue ‘On Philosophy’,” esp.68–69."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16The history of truthnotably Diodorus Siculus35and Plutarch,36and from neoplatonic philoso-phers such as Iamblichus or Proclus.37And as will be seen, the Renaissanceintellectuals who rediscovered all these traditions regarded theChaldaeanOraclesand the hermetic writings as first-hand testimonies from Zoroasterand Hermes Trismegistus respectively. All this makes Platonic Orientalisma perfectly appropriate label for the late antique milieus and traditions towhich the ancient wisdom discourse of the Renaissance referred.Against this background, the very emergence of that discourse ceases tobe a surprising phenomenon. Since their sources seemed to be in generalagreement about the oriental origins of platonism, it would have beenpeculiarly unplatonic (and, from their perspective, unhistorical) for ourItalian humanistsnotto have believed in the concepts ofprisca theolo-giaandphilosophia perennis, or, for that matter, to have denied at leasta potential validity to the ritual practices and “occult” arts which had soclearly been central to the sublime religion of the ancients. The sourcesat their disposal all seemed to concur in suggesting that this – and notjust a rational philosophy grounded in Socratic dialogue – was what pla-tonism was all about. For such a proposition one did not even need tofind direct confirmation in Plato himself.38Given the basic assumption(peculiarly unhistorical to us, but quite natural to them) that all the greatsages represented one and the same, timeless and universal wisdom tra-dition, it was not just unproblematic but perfectly logical to read Plato’sdialogues through what we now see as middle- and neoplatonic lenses.Hence Ficino, for example, could claim that in reading theEnneadsweare listening to Plato speaking through Plotinus’ mouth.39The point wasthat, even more precisely, both PlotinusandPlato were seen not as originaland innovative thinkers, but as mouthpieces of one and the same ancientand universal fountain of wisdom, whose author was ultimately Godhimself.35See above, n.29.36Plutarch,De Iside et Osiride,353–371, esp.354d–f,360d.37Iamblichus,Myst.i.1–2.Proclus,Theol.

Forexample, thePhaedruswas clearly not grounded in Socratic dialogue at all, but presented Socratesas passing on knowledge received in an inspired state ofmaniaor divine frenzy, and it is significantthat Ficino saw it as the “protodialogue” which contained the seeds for all the others (Allen,MarsilioFicino,13; Hanegraaff, “Platonic Frenzies”).39Ficino,Exhortatioto Plotinus’Enneads, in: Ficino,Opera,1548.

But how should we explain that such a strong commit-ment to the religion of ancient pagan nations could be seen, by Renaissanceplatonists, as not just perfectly compatible with Christian belief, but evenas a necessary prerequisite for truly understanding the nature of Christian-ity? This brings us to a second crucial background to the ancient wisdomdiscourse.the christian apologistsApologeticism – the polemical defense of one’s own position as superiorto others40– was central to the ancient wisdom discourse from its verybeginning, and “Tradition” was the symbolic capital41over which the vari-ous participants were competing. Thus, when Hecataeus of Abdera (fourthcent.bc) described how Orpheus, Homer, Solon, Pythagoras, Plato andmany others had acquired their knowledge and wisdom while visitingEgypt,42his point was to highlight that country as the original source ofhigher truth while dismissing Greek culture as derivative and second hand.In sharp contrast, but following the same logic, Diogenes Laertius (thirdcent.ce) opened his famous book about the lives of the eminent philoso-phers by refuting the barbarians’ claim: those who believe that philosophyoriginated among the Persians, Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Indians,Celts, or Gauls “forget that the achievements which they attribute to thebarbarians belong to the Greeks, with whom not merely philosophy butthe human race itself began.”43Likewise, historians such as Berossus withhisBabylonian History, Manetho with hisEgyptian History, or Philo ofByblus with hisPhoenician Historyall sought to present their respectivenations as the true origin of the cultural achievements claimed by theGreeks.44The unquestioned assumption they all held in common was thatantiquity equaled superiority, or, as formulated by Arthur J. Droge in hisfundamental study of the Christian apologists,40As pointed out by Hammer and von Stuckrad (“Introduction,” vii–ix; with special reference toCancik, “Apologetik/Polemik”), the concepts of apologeticism and polemicism are “inextricablyentwined: by defending one’s own position, one questions that of others; by denouncing thedoctrines and practices of others as false, one asserts one’s own claims to orthodoxy and orthopraxy.”Hence any instance of apologeticism is inherently polemic, and any polemicism is inherentlyapologetic.41See, for example, Bourdieu,Language and Symbolic Power,72–76.42Diodorus,Bibliotheca Historica,1.96–98.43Diogenes Laertius,Lives,i.3(Hicks ed.,4–5).

It was a general conviction of theage that the oldest was always best, that the present was an age of decadence, a lowpoint on the universal cycle; that the “ancients” were nearer to the gods and thebeginnings of things and therefore knew much more about them.45For a new religion like Christianity, this was obviously a problem. Tomake a convincing claim of superiority towards pagan religion, Christianauthors needed to counter the objection that their faith was merely arecent invention without historical depth, and hence without the legitimacyconferred by Tradition. In other words, they were faced with a task thatmight seem impossible: that of preaching the “good news” of the gospelwhile simultaneously denying its novelty. To meet this challenge and defeattheir opponents, the trump card they played was “Moses.”The first reference to Moses in pagan Greek literature occurs inHecataeus, who predictably claims him for Egypt:A man called Moses, highly esteemed in both practical wisdom and courage, wentout of Egypt into what is now called Judaea. He took possession of the regionand founded cities, among them the one named Jerusalem which is now the mostfamous. He also dedicated a temple most honored by them, introduced the ritualand worship of the deity, and legislated and regulated political affairs.46This account seems to be echoed in a passage attributed to an early Jew-ish historian, Eupolemus, where we read that Moses was “the first wiseman,” who taught the alphabet to the Jews and wrote laws for them.47A more explicit and influential refutation of Hecataeus occurs in a frag-ment attributed to another Jewish historian, Artapanus,48who was alsoresponding to the hostile picture of Moses in Manetho’sEgyptian History.Artapanus is explicit about Moses’ Jewish ancestry, identifies him withthe poet Musaeus, and calls him the master of Orpheus.49Moses emergesas the great benefactor of Egyptian civilization: he made many practi-cal inventions, but also invented philosophy, organized religious worship,45Ibid.,9; with reference to Armstrong, “Pagan and Christian Traditionalism.” Cf.

Renaissance authors, of course, did attribute it to Justin Martyr (on manuscripts and earlyeditions available to them, seeibid., vol.i,183–197).

Thus, in various places andat different times they have handed down to us the divine doctrine (8.1–2).59To show that Moses was much older than any of the Greek philosophers,Ad Graecosinvokes a long list of historians, including Flavius Josephusand Diodorus Siculus (9;cf.12). Nothing taught by Moses and thelater Prophets came from their own intellect: their knowledge was basedentirely upon a “divine and prophetic” gift bestowed upon them byGod (10.2).Such privileged divine inspiration was not granted to the Greeks. It wasonly because of their visits to Egypt, where they profited from the Mosaicwisdom, that Orpheus, Homer, Solon, Pythagoras, Plato, and other Greeks“began to circulate doctrines concerning the deities very different from theunfavorable opinions they had previously held” (14.2). As for Plato himself:although it was in Egypt that he must have read the Pentateuch (28.1), theauthor suggests (and keeps repeating) that if he did not speak more openlyabout Moses’ teaching of the One and Only God, this was only out of fearthat what had happened to Socrates might happen to him too (chs.20.1,22.1,27.1). Nevertheless, if one reads theTimaeusor theRepublic,onewillfind that it contains the same opinion as Moses concerning God (ch.22.1).In other words, many divine truths are present in Plato’s writings, but in aconcealed manner; and this partly hidden doctrine is derived from Moses,who in turn had received it directly from God.Still, this reasoning does not suffice to resolve the fundamental dilemmaof a new religion claiming to be ancient. Why would one need Christianityif all its divine truths were already available in the books of Moses? Theanswer is that Jesus Christrestoredthe ancient religion after it had beenabandoned due to the pernicious influence of the demonic entities whichthe pagans worship as their gods (38.1). As emphasized by the real JustinMartyr, Christianity is not radically new: it is a revival of the ancientreligion inspired by the eternalLogos:Christ is the first-born of God, being thelogosin which the whole race of humanbeings shares.

At theiraltar devoted to “the Unknown God,” the Athenians had been worshipingthe Christian God without knowing it, and hence Paul told them that“whom you ignorantly worship, him I declare unto you” (Acts17:23).Following the same logic, the apologetic argument in the wake of JustinMartyr made it possible for Christian platonists to interpret Plato and allthe other authorities of “Platonic Orientalism” as unconscious Christians,who had been inspired by the divineLogoswithout knowing it.61It is important to be precise about the type of macrohistory impliedby this perspective. The argumentation follows the essential logic ofphilosophia perennis, but could also easily be interpreted in support ofpiaphilosophia, suggesting some kind of progress: the implicit or unconsciousChristianity of the good pagans who lived in accordance with the universalLogoshas now become explicit and conscious, so to speak, in the Chris-tian message. In other words, the true and universal religion has recentlyfound its most perfect expression in the teachings of Christ. It is for thisvery reason thatAd Graecoscannot be properly interpreted as defendingaprisca theologiain the strict “genetic” sense. It may be true that Chris-tianity restores the “ancient wisdom” of Moses, but the true religion doesnot depend on that reference, nor is Judaism its most perfect expression.That Moses happens to have been the earliest sage surely gives him greaterauthority than his pagan competitors; but it is not concluded that earlieralways means better, for that would have forced Christians to prefer Mosesover Jesus Christ. In short: although radical novelty equals inferiority, itdoes not necessarily follow that great antiquity equals superiority.Pagan intellectuals could afford to make an easier and more straightfor-ward argument against novelty. Probably in175or17662– that is to say,shortly after Justin’s death, and very probably in response to his work63–an otherwise unknown platonist philosopher named Celsus wrote the firstsystematic pagan attack on Christianity.64HisAlethes Logosrested on the61For Justin’s perspective as a typical example of “orthodox” middle platonism, see Andresen, “Justinund der mittlere Platonismus.” As pointed out by the same author, already well before his conversionJustin understood platonism as a religious doctrine, whose goal was to liberate the soul from earthlyentanglements and lead it upwards to the divine Being (ibid.,194–195).62See discussion in Droge,Homer or Moses?,74–75.63Andresen,Logos und Nomos,308–400; Nock, review of Andresen,316–317;Wilken,Christians,101;Droge,Homer or Moses?,76–77.64Generally on Celsus’ critique of Christianity, see, for example, Dodds,Pagan and Christian,102–138;Nestle, “Haupteinw ̈ande”; Labriolle,R ́eaction pa ̈ıenne,111–169;Wilken,Christians,94–125."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Christian apologists23by now familiar assumption that “there is an ancient doctrine [archaioslogos] which has existed from the beginning, which has always been main-tained by the wisest nations and cities and wise men.”65But among themany ancient peoples and traditions cited by Celsus (Egyptians, Syrians,Indians, Persians, Odrysians, Samothracians, Eleusinians, Hyperboreans,Galactophagoi, Druids, and Getae), the Jews are conspicuously absent;and likewise, Moses does not figure in his lists of inspired theologians.The reason is simply that, far from being the original source of the ancientreligion, Moses with his doctrine of radical or exclusive monotheism hadbeen responsible for its corruption: “the goatherds and shepherds who fol-lowed Moses as their leader were deluded by clumsy deceits into thinkingthat there was only one God, [and] without any rational cause...thesegoatherds and shepherds abandoned the worship of many gods.”66Butwhile the Jews at least kept following their own native tradition, peculiarand misguided as it might be, Christianity is even worse: “I will ask themwhere they come from, or who is the author of their traditional laws.Nobody, they will say.”67Not only did Christianity originate as a rebellionagainst Jewish tradition,68which is already bad enough, but the Christianswith their new religion deliberately break with all other traditions as well:they are a people without roots, who “wall themselves off and break awayfrom the rest of mankind.”69With Justin Martyr on the one hand, and Celsus on the other, the twoopposing perspectives on “ancient wisdom” were clearly defined. In Tatian’sAgainst the Greeks(written probably between176and178)70we find anargument that is similar to Justin’s, but marked by a virulent anti-Greeksentiment. Far from being the original source of higher culture, the Greeksare mere imitators; Christianity is the most recent manifestation of the“wisdom of the barbarians,” of which Moses is the earliest representative.71In Clement of Alexandria, a generation later, the imitators have become65Origen,Contra Celsum1.14(Chadwick ed.,17).66Origen,Contra Celsum1.23(Chadwick ed.,22). Cf.1.24, where Celsus contends that “it makesno difference” whether one calls the supreme God by the name used among the Greeks, or thatamong the Indians or that among the Egyptians (Chadwick ed.,23: and similar argument in5.41[Chadwick ed.,296–297]). For Origen, of course, it did make a difference. As rightly pointed outby Droge (Homer or Moses?,79), it would not be correct to refer to Celsus’ perspective simply as“polytheism”; rather, it is an “inclusive” or “qualitative” monotheism as opposed to the “exclusive”or “quantitative” monotheism of Jewish religion.67Origen,Contra Celsum5.33(Chadwick ed.,289).68Origen,Contra Celsum2.1,4;3.5;5.33,41;cf.Wilken,Christians,112–117.69Origen,Contra Celsum8.2(Chadwick ed.,454).70See discussion in Droge,Homer or Moses?,83–84.71Waszink, “Some Observations,”49–52;Droge,Homer or Moses?,82–101."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24The history of truththieves: the Greeks have “stolen” their philosophy from the wisdom of thebarbarian nations (the Egyptians, Chaldaeans, Druids, Celts, Samanaeans,Magi, and Indians), who have ultimately derived it from Moses.72But sim-ilar to Justin Martyr, Clement seems to perceive no sharp conflict betweensuch a “genetic” approach and a universalist doctrine oftheologia naturalis(again based upon the concept of the universalLogos) according to whichthe pagan philosophers, including the Greeks, can also have discoveredsome important truths by their own reason or by divine inspiration.73Oneexample mentioned specifically by Clement (which would later becomeimportant to Ficino as well) was that of the Persians, whosemageiahadallowed them to predict the birth of Jesus and who had followed a star tofind their way to Bethlehem.74Although Moses is the earliest authority,the pagans therefore do not entirely depend on his influence to find truth.The apologetic literature of the second and third centuries culminatedin Origen’s treatiseAgainst Celsus. Criticizing Celsus’ exclusion of Mosesfrom the list of ancient sages, he refers to Platonic Orientalists such asNumenius to defend Moses as the earliest “barbarian” authority on whichthe Greeks are dependent.75It is on this foundation that he proceeds toa point-by-point refutation of Celsus. But again, like his predecessors,Origen concedes that the pagans may also have been inspired by Goddirectly: “God has implanted in the souls of all men the truths which Hetaught through the prophets and the Saviour.”76If the earlier phase of Christian apologetics was dominated by the posi-tions of which Justin Martyr and Celsus were the pioneers,77asecondphase developed in the wake of a new pagan attack on Christianity, by theneoplatonist Porphyry.78Porphyry may have been raised as a Christian, and72Clement’s “theft of the Greeks” theory occurs throughout theStromateis, except for booksiiiandvii.See discussion in Munck,Untersuchungen,127–151(“Diebstahl der Hellenen”); Molland,Conceptionof the Gospel,52–67;Droge,Homer or Moses?,142–149.73See, for example, Clement,Strom.i.57.1–58.4;91–96; and the excellent discussion in Lilla,Clement ofAlexandria,12–28, who discusses in detail how, according to Clement, theLogosmay be responsibleboth for the “dim” knowledge that may be achieved by means of natural reason and for a moredirect gn ̄osis received by divine inspiration. Next to the “theft theory” (see above, n.72), Clementpresented a second story of theft inspired by the Enochian literature, claiming that some inferiorpowers or angels gave philosophy to men after having stolen it from God, who providentiallyallowed this to happen (Lilla,Clement of Alexandria,29).

What we do have isthe systematic refutation by Eusebius in hisPraeparatio Evangelica, writtenbetween314and318.Eusebius offers a systematic history of culture in order to defend a bynow familiar thesis: not only is Christianity true and ancient, but it is truebecauseit is ancient.83But while he repeats many of the arguments of earlierapologists, the scholarly sophistication of Porphyry’s polemics forces himto develop an account that is considerably more complex than theirs, andwill be summarized here only in its barest outlines.84The earliest period ofhuman history, starting with the Fall, was marked by primitive savagery;and from this wholly negative matrix of ignorance emerged the pagan-ism of the Egyptians and Phoenicians, which was adopted by the Greeksand, under the increasing influence of demons, finally led to the pagansuperstition that filled the Graeco-Roman world. Next to this demonicdevelopment, however, and independent of it, the true religion emergedthanks to God’s action through hisLogos.85During the earliest time ofsavagery and ignorance, a very few men “through incontrovertible reason-ings led up their thoughts from visible things to the creator of the whole79On the problem of dating, see Droge,Homer or Moses?,179–180, who argues thatAgainst theChristianswas most probably written briefly before the persecution of the Christians by Diocletian(303–313) and may have served as its ideological justification.80Collected by Adolf von Harnack, in Porphyrius,“Gegen die Christen.”Porphyry’s work was con-demned at the Council of Nicaea in325, and the emperors Theodosius II and Valentinian IIIorderedittobeburnedin448.81Eusebius,Praep.

By the timeof Christ it was still preserved by the Jews, as an alternative to the falsereligion of paganism, which, however, still dominated the empire. In thissituation, the coming of Christ and the diffusion of the gospel accom-plished something new and unique: it spelt the death of the demons andthereby brought the end of paganism.87Although Eusebius introduces aclear element of progress here, the true religion established as Christianitywas itself not new: it embodies the ancient religion of the Hebrews, as ithad existed prior even to the establishment of Jewish religion by Moses:The Hebrews who were earlier in time than Moses, having never heard of theMosaic legislation, enjoyed a free and unfettered mode of religion, being regulatedby the manner of life which is in accordance with nature, so that they had no needof laws to rule them because of the extreme freedom of their soul from passions,but had received true knowledge of the doctrines concerning God.88Christianity, in other words, is the original and most ancient religion of theHebrews, in which the freedom of the gospel once again takes precedenceover the strictures of Jewish Law. While this does not make Judaism inferior,it does make Christianity superior.Eusebius was writing in the church library of Caesarea, where he wasusing a collection that had previously been owned by Origen. Apart fromthe works of historians, the philosophical core of this library consisted ofPlato and a particularly rich assortment of middle- and neoplatonic textsrepresentative of the “oriental” school.89Eusebius’ knowledge of this tradi-tion was very profound90and particularly important for us, for althoughthe religion of the pagans is rejected as demonic, he believes the platonicphilosophyto be derived from Hebrew sources and to agree in its essencewith Christianity. It is from this context that we must understand Eusebius’famous quotation of a statement by Numenius: “What is Plato but Mosesspeaking Attic Greek?”91The basic lines of argumentation developed by the apologists from Justinto Eusebius were taken up, and thereby received further confirmation, by86Eusebius,Praep.

In otherwords, Augustine does defend aphilosophia perennis: it represents the truereligion that had already been known to the pagan nations, and whichcame to be called the Christian religion after the universalLogoshad beenincarnated as Jesus Christ.97We may conclude that, as long as Moses was highlighted as the ultimatesource of true religion, the ancient wisdom narrative of the Renaissancecould claim very secure patristic authority. Pagan wisdom could be seen asinspired by theLogos, or derived from Mosaic origins, and as foreshadowingChristian truth; and platonism in particular (or more precisely, its “orien-talist” middle- and neoplatonic orientation) was bound to play a specialrole as providing the privileged language of mediation by which the gapbetween philosophical reason and revealed religion could be bridged.

Hardly less important is that theywere vying over a different kind of symbolic capital, according to the rulesdetermined in each case by the dominant culture: the patristic apologistshad needed to prove that their religion could claim the authority of anancient and venerable Tradition, but the Renaissance humanists needed todemonstrate that the pagan sources could be reconciled with theologicalorthodoxy.98And finally, whereas the presence and wide diffusion of paganliterature was the obvious point of departure for Christian apologists (sothat the need for its preservation or destruction might be an object ofdiscussion, not its recovery), Renaissance humanists were dealing with asituation where pagan literature was being newly recovered and broughtto light after a long period of near-absence and oblivion.

They regarded him as theircommon teacher, the common benefactor of mankind, the common pride ofnature. They called him Plato and Socrates, for he was not inferior to those twoin wisdom, as everybody would agree.102Much later, in1492, Marsilio Ficino would evoke a similar picture in thededication to Lorenzo de’ Medici of his translation of Plotinus’Enneads:at the time of the Council, he writes, the young Cosimo de’ Medici hadoften listened to Plethon, who had “spoken of the platonic mysteries likea second Plato.”103The implication is that during those meetings Plethonhad sown the seeds that had blossomed two decades later in the PlatonicAcademy of Florence. We will return to the veracity of this.100On Plethon, see Schultze,Georgios Gemistos Plethon; Masai,Pl ́ethon; Woodhouse,George GemistosPlethon;Blum,Georgios Gemistos Plethon; Tambrun,Pl ́ethon; [no editor],Sul ritorno di Pletone.Inaddition, important chapters are devoted to him by Hankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,vol.i,193–217and his appendix “Pletho’s Influence” in vol.ii,436–440; and Stausberg,FaszinationZarathushtra,vol.i,35–82.

Of course the Council was not aboutphilosophy but about church doctrine and politics; and that an ancientPersian sage could have something to do with Plato may have been neitherapparent nor particularly relevant to the Italian churchmen and politicians.But that a suggestive parallel could be drawn between the visit of the Byzan-tine delegation to the head of Western Christianity, and the biblical story oftheMagiwho had come from the East to venerate the Christ child – therebyconfirming the concordance of their ancient wisdom with the teachings ofChristianity – was certainly not lost on them. Hence during the festivitiesaround the feast of St. John at the closing of the Council in1439, the Greekswere dazzled by a luxurious procession of men dressed up like theMagifollowing the star. This spectacle was staged presumably in honor of theirown presence, but carried a subtext of Western superiority that they wereunlikely to miss: for all their wisdom, the Eastern sages had been obligedto travel all the way to the West, and having reached their destination theyhad knelt and paid homage to God’s representative on earth.104Twenty years later, in1459, Cosimo de’ Medici commissioned a greatfresco by Benozzo Gozzoli calledThe Journey of the Magi, in which thememory of the Council still resonates strongly.105As convincingly arguedby Brigitte Tambrun with reference to this work of art, Cosimo’s well-attested fascination with the biblicalMagi106from the East is inseparable104This procession and its significance was first called to the attention of scholars by Tambrun,Pl ́ethon,26. The procession in question, on June23,1439, was modeled after similar ones organizedannually on the occasion of Epiphany, by a para-liturgical fraternity known as theCompagnia de’Magiunder the patronage of the Medici (Hatfield, “Compagni de’ Magi,” esp.113; Chastel,Artet humanisme,240–248; Buhler, “Marsilio Ficino’sDe Stella Magorum,”350–351). The subtextof Western superiority is not mentioned by Tambrun, but seems obvious given the consistentlyarrogant attitude of the Latin theologians towards their Byzantine counterparts, for whom theCouncil became a mostly humiliating experience (see, for example, Woodhouse,George GemistosPlethon,119–120,123,125,176).105Tambrun,Pl ́ethon,23–33. Possibly the picture of Balthazar is based upon the portrait of EmperorJohn VIII.

Probably toward the end of thefirst decade of the fifteenth century, Emperor Manuel II Paleologus senthim to Mistra in the southern Peloponnese, a town with a relatively free-spirited atmosphere where the ancient Hellenistic traditions still survived,and which would remain his residence for the rest of his life. Far frombeing an ivory-tower philosopher, Gemistos seems to have been active ina variety of public functions: in Constantinople he was a member of theSenate, and during his life he held various administrative positions, actedas a judge, and was frequently consulted by the emperors and the despotsof the Morea. If not consulted, he offered his advice anyway. Although theChurch suspected him of heresy, the imperial family seems to have thoughthighly of him, and he was richly rewarded for his services.109Although he107Ficino, Proemium, in Kristeller,Supplementum Ficinianumii,104–105(and see Kristeller, “MarsilioFicino as a Beginning Student,”103with n.32).108Tambrun,Pl ́ethon,31; and see the entirely analogous argument made by Allen,Synoptic Art,37–40.Tambrun’s reference to Augustine as an authority for the revival of Hermes is questionable (forAugustine’s actual view of Hermes, see Hanegraaff, “Hermetism”), but this does not affect herargument.109Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon, chaptervi, esp.87."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32The history of truthwas a layman, his presence in the imperial delegation to the Council ofFerrara and Florence was therefore not surprising.It might seem strange for a man approaching his eightieth birthday,but the Council was undoubtedly the turning point of his life, as indi-cated not only by his adoption of a new pen-name “Plethon” (probablywith deliberate reference to his status as a “second Plato”),110but mostsignificantly by the fact that his major writings were produced during andafter the trip to Italy. Although as an opponent of Union he made someactive contributions to the official proceedings of the Council,111their theo-logical hairsplitting left him rather indifferent; but he immediately felt athome among the Florentine humanists, who eagerly sought his adviceabout Greek philosophy. Plethon must have been flattered by their atten-tion and admiration, but shocked by their lack of knowledge about Platoand Aristotle. The former had only just begun to be rediscovered, withpioneering but as yet limited translation efforts by Uberto Decembrio,Leonardo Bruni and a few others;112and the latter was poorly understoodnot only by the humanists, but even by the scholastics, who claimed hisauthority but actually knew him mainly through Latin and Arab sourcesand read him through the lenses of Averroes – who had not even knownGreek.113To correct such misunderstandings, Plethon during his sojournin Florence wrote a short text in Greek,Wherein Aristotle disagrees withPlato, usually referred to asDe differentiis. It purported to demonstratethat Aristotle went wrong whenever he departed from Plato and is con-sidered the opening shot in the famous Plato–Aristotle controversy of theRenaissance, which lasted until the early1470s.114110On this pseudonym, see Masai,Pl ́ethon,384–386; Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon,186–188.His pupil Michael Apostoles also addressed him as a “second Plato,” and Bessarion not only referredto him as “second only to Plato” (Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon,186–188), but at one pointeven as his reincarnation: “Plato’s soul . . . has been sent to earth to assume the body of Gemistosand his life” (letter of condolences to Plethon’s son, as reproduced in Masai,Pl ́ethon,307;itisamusing to read, on the same page, how much this has shocked modern commentators).111See Laurent, “M ́emoires”; and discussion in Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon,136–147.112See Hankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,vol.i,Partsi–ii.113Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon,147–153.114Modern edition in: Lagarde, “LeDe differentiisde Pl ́ethon”; English translation in Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon,192–214; German translation in Blum,Georgios Gemistos Plethon,112–150.AlthoughDe differentiiswas a pioneering attempt (Tambrun, “Marsile Ficin et le ‘Commentaire’,”12–13with n.13), it may have been too sophisticated for Italian humanists at the time (Monfasani,George of Trebizond,203), and its influence on the eventual development of the Plato–Aristotledebate must not be exaggerated (Tambrun, “Marsile Ficin et le ‘Commentaire’,”9).

This Jew wasan adherent of Averroes and other Persian and Arabic interpreters of Aristotle’sworks, which the Jews had translated into their own language, but he paid littleregard to Moses or the beliefs and observances which the Jews received from him.This man also expounded to Gemistos the doctrines of Zoroaster and others.He was ostensibly a Jew but in fact a Hellenist. Gemistos stayed with him for along time, not only as his pupil but also in his service, living at his expense, forhe was one of the most influential men at the court of these barbarians. His namewas Elissaeus.120In another letter, Scholarios repeated most of these elements, referring toElissaeus as a “polytheist” and adding that he met his end in the flames. Hewrites specifically that Plethon had “no previous knowledge” of Zoroasterbefore being introduced to the Persian sage by his Jewish master.121Plethon himself never mentions Elissaeus, and his enemy Scholariosremains our only direct source, but the latter’s statements make senseif they are placed in context. The “court of the barbarians” (that is tosay, the Muslims) in this period could only be Adrianople, which hadbeen captured by the Turks in1360, and where many Jews enjoyed highoffice in the Ottoman magistrature and administration. That Elissaeuswas an adherent of “Averroes and other Persian and Arabic interpretersof Aristotle’s works” identifies him as a philosopher typical of this timeand place, who combined the occidental aristotelianism in the tradition ofAverroes (imported and translated by Spanish Jews) with its oriental andAvicennian counterpart in the influential “illuminationist” philosophy ofSuhraward ̄ıandhisishr ̄aqischool.122That the latter was wholly groundedin Greek philosophy, and Platonic Orientalism in particular, has beendemonstrated exhaustively by John Walbridge.123At the very opening of120Letter to Princess Theodora Asesina, the wife of the Despot of Mistra, Demetrios Palaiologos.Scholarios,Oeuvres,iv,152–153; trans. according to Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon,24.121Letter to the Exarch Joseph, but here written as if addressing Plethon in the second person.Scholarios,Oeuvres,iv,162; trans. according to Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon,25.122Ta r d i e u , “ P l ́ethon lecteur des oracles,”144–146; and cf. his quotation from Plethon’s responseto Scholarios, according to which he has derived Averroes’ opinion about the soul from learnedItalians and from Jewish teachers.

The words of theAncients are symbolic and not open to refutation. The criticisms made of the literalsense of their words fail to address their real intentions, for a symbol cannot berefuted.124In an analogous passage much further on, Suhraward ̄ı emphasized thelimits of peripatetic reason when it comes to understanding the “scienceof lights,” whose nature and reality can ultimately be known only by thedirect intuition of “pure souls” during a state of divine ecstasy:All those possessing insight and detachment bear witness to this. Most of theallusions of the prophets and the great philosophers point to this.

With their per-vasive symbolism of light and fire as representing the divine, they wouldbe seen as highly representative not only of Suhraward ̄ı’s ancient pre-platonic “science of lights” but also, more specifically, of the fire cult thathad always been associated with Zoroastrian religion.126In the Introduc-tion to hisPhilosophy of Illumination,Suhraward ̄ı distinguished explicitlybetween the true doctrine of light that was taught by the ancient Persian124Suhraward ̄ı,Hikmat al-ishr ̄aq, Introduction (Arab orig. with English trans. in Suhraward ̄ı,Philos-ophy of Illumination,2).125Ibid.,ii.2.165–166(in: Suhraward ̄ı,Philosophy of Illumination,107–108).126De Jong,Traditions of the Magi,343–350."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36The history of truthphilosophers, and the false doctrine of the “infidelMagi,” or the heresyof Mani.127Furthermore, anybody looking at the Greek sources from thatperspective – and everything Plethon writes about Zoroaster can ultimatelybe traced to them128–couldnotfailtonoticethatthetermmagoshad adouble meaning there as well: it could mean a “sage” practicing the ancientcult of the true gods129or it could have the negative meaning of a sor-cerer, a practitioner ofgoetia.130Plethon, for his part, now seems to haveconcluded that whereas Zoroaster and theMagiwere the depositors of theancient, true and universal131religion of Zoroaster, the “Chaldaeans” rep-resented a later development that had corrupted the truth, leading to thefalse doctrine of dualism and practices of sorcery. Hence all three oraclesthat dealt withgoetiawere removed by him from Psellus’ collection132alongwith the adjective “Chaldaean,” and the remaining series was attributed toZoroaster and theMagi. In this manner, Plethon believed he had restoredthe most ancient source of the platonic tradition to its original purity.133Back in Mistra, Plethon wrote his major philosophical synthesis, theNomoi(Laws), which seems to have been made known only to the selectmembership of his intimate circle of pupils. Around1460–1465,whenPlethon’s manuscript turned up in the possession of Princess Theodora,his enemy Scholarios (now Patriarch of Constantinople) had most of itburned and ordered the destruction of any surviving copies on pain ofexcommunication.134Scholarios himself, however, preserved those parts hefelt he needed to back up his accusations.

First, Plethon is explicitin presenting his list of “lawgivers and philosophers” as a positive categoryagainst its negative counterpart, consisting of “poets and sophists.” Thislatter term turns out to be a code for the founders of revealed religions, andChristians in particular.136Second, as the very title of the work suggests aswell, the combination of “philosophers and lawgivers” has evident politicalimplications: by preaching a return to the “ancient wisdom” away from the“sophists,” Plethon was advocating a reform not only of religion but of thestate and its legislation as well.137And third, on his list of ancient authoritiesthere are some surprising absentees. Orpheus is not mentioned among theearly Greek sages138nor is Proclus among the neoplatonists;139but moststriking is the absence of Hermes and Moses. In trying to explain thisomission, we get to the heart of the matter: the relation between paganismand Christianity in Plethon’s version of the ancient wisdom narrative.Plethon’s genealogy is a deliberate alternative to the Christian apolo-getic literature since Justin Martyr, according to which the Greeks weredependent upon Moses.140Brigitte Tambrun has made a plausible casethat the first chapters of hisNomoiare modeled after the Prologue ofJustin’sDialogue with Tryphon, and that, in writing them, Plethon tookinspiration from the satirical writings of Lucian of Samosata, with whichhe was familiar.141With the experience of the Council fresh in his mind,135Plethon,Nomoii.2(Brague ed.,31–33); and see discussion in Tambrun,Pl ́ethon,85–89.136We b b, “Nomoi,”215–216and n.16. One negative characteristic of “sophists” is that they are foreverin search of the new, whereas Plethon declares that he has invented nothing (ibid.,216). Of coursethis line of thought is typical of the late antique discourse of ancient wisdom.137We b b, “Nomoi,”219.138Orpheus is absent, along with Homer, undoubtedly because Plethon had just emphasized thatpoets are unreliable as guides to wisdom (Nomoii.2[Brague ed.,29]).

In other words, Plethon was so dependent on Proclus that he preferred not to call attentionto his influence.140For a discussion of Plethon’s systematic inversion of the perspective of the patristic apologists, seeTambrun,Pl ́ethon,72–80.141Tambrun,Pl ́ethon,60–63."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"38The history of truththe supremacy of Greek tradition had to be reaffirmed; but the origins oftrue philosophy were traced back not to Moses but to a rival legislator,Zoroaster. The polemical intention cannot possibly be overlooked: in clearcontradiction of the entire tradition of patristic apologetics, Plethon wastrying to replace the religion grounded in Mosaic Law by a different onegrounded in Zoroaster’s ancient philosophy of fire and light.142In doingso, he was essentially adopting Celsus’ strategy of excluding Moses fromthe genealogy of wisdom.143That he also ignored Hermes is slightly morepuzzling, but may be explained by a combination of factors: a traditionalGreek disrespect for the ancient Egyptians,144the fact that Hermes wasalso known as a legislator and might therefore weaken the claim Plethonwas making for Zoroaster,145and, most importantly, the fact that Hermescould always be presented as having learned his wisdom from the Egyp-tian Moses, which would weaken the strength of Plethon’s argument byreintroducing the patristic alternative through the back door.146Plethon, defending a universal and perennial tradition of ancient wis-dom grounded in the religion of Zoroaster and theMagi, was breakingso deliberately with the patristic apologetic tradition that the conclusioncannot be avoided: what he had in mind was nothing less than a revival ofpaganism in deliberate opposition to Christianity. A typical manifestationof Platonic Orientalism, it was to replace the exclusive monotheism linkedto the name of Moses by an inclusive or qualitative monotheism alongthe lines of Celsus and Proclus.147If we give credence to the testimony ofGeorge of Trebizond, Plethon believed that his philosophy was destinedto replace Christianity and Islam as the religion of the future.

His case shows that once the basic textual sources of the pla-tonic tradition became available to a Christian culture where the need forreligious reform was widely felt, paganism became a religious option intheory at least.

Wealready saw that in the frankly paranoid imagination of George of Trebi-zond, who believed in a full-blown conspiracy of platonists seeking thedestruction of Christianity, Plethon was a “poisonous viper” hiding behindthe mask of a venerable philosopher.157In a very similar vein, Scholariosdescribed Plethon as a man who had been “dominated by Hellenic ideas”since his youth and was reading the Greek poets and philosophers not forthe sake of their language but “in order to associate himself with them.” Asa result, he had come under the influence of demons and had fallen intothe same errors as Julian the Apostate. This development had culminatedin his apprenticeship with the lapsed Jew Elissaeus. Ever since, he had beentrying to conceal his true ideas for opportunistic reasons, but was unableto do so in teaching his pupils.158which seriously modifies the attractive picture of a Plethon freely discoursing about Plato withina circle of admiring pupils.153See discussion of mnemohistory on pp.375–376.154See above, page29.155Woodhouse,George Gemistos Plethon, ix.156Peuckert,Pansophie,10–11.157On George of Trebizond’s megalomania and paranoid extremes, see Hankins,Plato in the ItalianRenaissance,vol.i,167–174.158Letter to Princess Theodora Asesina, in Scholarios,Oeuvres,iv,152–153; trans.

As our story unfolds, we will continue to encounterboth images in endless variations.the platonic theologian: marsilio ficinoWe have seen that according to the traditional “legend of GemistosPlethon,” it was while listening to his lectures during the Council at Flor-ence that the young Cosimo de’ Medici conceived the idea of refoundingPlato’s Academy in his own city. About twenty years later, so the story goes,he met Marsilio Ficino, the son of his personal physician, and realized thatthis bright young philosopher with his obvious love for Plato could makehis dream a reality. He therefore arranged for him to learn Greek, gave hima manuscript of Plato’s complete dialogues,159and a villa in Careggi thatbecame the center of the new Platonic Academy under Ficino’s leadership.This attractive story has been repeated by nearly every scholar who haswritten on the revival of platonism in Renaissance Florence until1990,160when it was exploded as a typical case of mnemohistorical fiction by theresearches of James Hankins.161159Ms. Florence, Laur.lxxx,9, copied during the time of the Council from Plethon’s own orig-inal (Gentile, in Gentileet al.,Marsilio Ficino,28–31; Gentile, “Note sui manoscritti”; Diller,“Autographs”).

We have no independent evidence that Cosimo actually met Plethon; if hedid, there was a serious language barrier between them; the picture of Cosimo as a Platonist isquestionable; the idea of the “Platonic Academy” rests on only two passages by Ficino himself;the Academy is never mentioned even in the correspondence between Cosimo and Ficino; andall other fifteenth-/sixteenth-century sources show a near-total absence of any allusions to it.Hankins concludes that Ficino formed the center only of a kind of “informal gymnasium” forhis pupils, which, moreover, was not particularly platonic in orientation, did not stand under thepatronage of the Medici, and was not located in Careggi (“Myth,”449and457–459). Ficino’s tworeferences to a platonic “academy” (in a letter to Cosimo of September1462and the preface tohis Plotinus translation of1490/1492; Latin original and English trans. in Hankins, “Cosimo de’Medici,”149–151,159–160) should be understood as metaphorical references to Plato’s writings(Hankins, “Cosimo de’ Medici,”152–156; “Myth,”433–436). Hankins’ two articles came shortlyafter the publication of Field,Origins of the Platonic Academy, but he did not position himselfagainst the latter. In his “Platonic Academy of Florence,” published in2002, Field conceded manyof Hankins’ points but disagreed with some others, and concluded that even if there was noformal institution under Medici patronage, the term “Platonic Academy” remains appropriate forreferring to Ficino’s circle (ibid.,376).

Cosimo ordered Ficino to postpone his workon Plato and translate this document first: Hermes had been arguably themost ancient and therefore most authoritative source from which Platohad derived his wisdom, and Cosimo wanted to have a chance to readhim before his death. Ficino duly finished the translation in April1463,and it was published in1471asLiber de Potestate et Sapientia DeiorPimander(with reference to C. H. I, the “Poimandres”).162According tothe extremely influential narrative of Frances A. Yates in herGiordano Brunoand the Hermetic Tradition(1964), to which we will return at length, thiswas the beginning of the “Hermetic Tradition” of the Renaissance. Yateswas undoubtedly right about the crucial importance of Ficino’sPimanderfor the reception history of hermetism in the Renaissance; but rather thanseeing the latter as a quasi-autonomous tradition of hermetic magic, Iwill suggest it is better understood as merely a dimension – albeit a veryimportant one – of the more general history of Platonic Orientalism in theRenaissance.Of course the fictionality of the Florentine Academy does not detractfrom the unquestionable importance of the platonic revival of the sec-ond half of the fifteenth century, or from Ficino’s centrality to it;163andneither do doubts about Frances Yates’ narrative diminish Ficino’s crucialimportance in view of the subsequent fascination with Hermes amongRenaissance intellectuals. However, to properly understand and contextu-alize the vogue of “Plato” and “Hermes,” it must be emphasized once morethat from the orientalist perspective, neither of the two (not to mentionother ancient sages such as Orpheus, Zoroaster or, indeed, Moses) were per-ceived as autonomous philosophers in their own right, who might possiblythe “myth” has developed historically after having been created by Francesco Verino in1577(ibid.,18–35). The bottom line is that Field does not seem to consider the matter as important as Hankinsdoes. In line with my emphasis, throughout this book, on the distinction between mnemohistoryand historiography (see below, pp.375–376), I would agree with Hankins here.162For the basic story, see Kristeller, “Marsilio Ficino e Lodovico Lazzarelli,”223; it was repeatednotably in Yates,Giordano Bruno,12–13. Since then it has been retold so often that any attempt atlisting the references would be futile. On the details of Ficino’s translation and their significancefor how he understood the hermetic message, see Hanegraaff, “How hermetic was RenaissanceHermetism?”.163The scholarly literature is immense.

On the contrary, for a thinkerlike Ficino their importance resided in their status as inspired mouthpiecesof the ancient, timeless and universal wisdom whose ultimate author wasGod. We will not grasp the nature of the ancient wisdom narrative of theRenaissance unless we clearly understand this point, which so evidentlyclashes with the most basic and natural assumptions shared by modernhistorians of philosophy.In a very similar vein, when Ficino described how the ancient wisdompreserved in Byzantium had traveled to Florence, he was not thinking pri-marily of Greek manuscripts carried westward by monks and middlemen,or eighty-year-old philosophers crossing the Mediterranean by boat. In hismystical and poetic imagination, such mundane contingencies of historywere merely the external manifestation of profound spiritual influencesand meaningful synchronicities, all working mysteriously under the guid-ance of divine providence.164From a historian’s perspective, however, wemust still ask ourselves how his concept of ancient wisdom emerged anddeveloped over time, and what were its main sources of inspiration. If webegin with Plethon, we find that apart from his symbolic significance asthe“WiseManfromtheEast,”hiswritingsdidexertalimitedbutspecificinfluence on Ficino’s thinking. Ficino owned and annotated at least one ofPlethon’s own manuscripts, which contained several of his own writingsalong with fragments from other authors, including Eusebius, Julian andSynesius;165and the influence of theChaldaean Oraclesand Plethon’s com-mentary can be traced particularly in hisPlatonic Theology.166Whether hehad any familiarity with Plethon’sNomoiremains somewhat unclear.167Ficino’s concern with ancient wisdom went through several phases. Hisyouthful enthusiasm for the platonic philosophy, at a time when he didnot yet read Greek, was based upon Latin authors such as notably Augus-tine, Macrobius, Calcidius, and Apuleius, who looked at Plato through164See the two letters mentioning the Platonic “Academy” (above, n.161) with Hankins’ commentary(“Cosimo de’ Medici,”149–152): they are full of references to synchronistic correspondencesbetween the moments of Ficino singing Orpheus’ “Hymn to the Cosmos” and the writing anddelivery of Cosimo’s letter; minds in higher mental states influencing and “impregnating” others“in some unknown way,” both during life and after death; and meaningful patterns of relationbetween various specific moments in time.165Ms. Florence, Riccardianus graecus76(Gentile and Gilly,Marsilio Ficino,90–91; Tambrun,“Marsile Ficin et le ‘Commentaire’,”14–15).166Klutstein, “Marsile Ficin et les ‘Oracles Chalda ̈ıques’,”331–338; and especially Tambrun, “MarsileFicin et le ‘Commentaire’.” A Latin translation of theChaldaean Oracleslong attributed to Ficino,Magica (id est philosophica) dicta magorum ex Zoroastre(Ms. Florence, Laurent.xxxvi,35), turnsout not to be by him (see Klutstein, “Marsile Ficin,”332, with reference to herFicino et la th ́eologieancienne).167Tambrun, “Marsile Ficin et le ‘Commentaire’,”15."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44The history of truthmiddle- and neoplatonic lenses and presented him as a religious philoso-pher. He began to read Plato himself in the early translations by Bruni andprobably Decembrio.168Already at this early stage, around the mid-1450s,he was full of enthusiasm about the wisdom of the “ancient sages,”169andhis attraction to pagan thinkers seems to have alarmed some of his men-tors. Lorenzo Pisano’s dialogues, based upon real discussions that took placein his circle in Florence, describe some dramatic confrontations betweenelderly conservative clerics and rebellious youths entranced with poetryand paganism, prominent among whom was Ficino. These young menwere defending the beauties and virtues of Plato and pagan poetry, butwere frequently exhorted to rather follow the “pure and sincere wisdom ofthe Church Fathers” and turn away from the degenerate pagan philosophy,particularly Plato, “a pagan alien from God and from the gifts of Christ.”170In a telling dialogue by Antonio degli Agli, the author warns Ficino againstthe vanity and error of pagan thought, and exhorts him to “Tarry not inturning yourself back to the knowledge of God, and leave Plato and othersof his sort behind!”171And Bartolomeo Scala was almost certainly think-ing of Ficino when, in hisDe nobilioribus philosophorum sectis, he chidedplatonists and other “fools who philosophize with the pagans.”172Having reached a more mature age, Ficino seems to have regrettedhis youthful extravagances. According to a credible account by ZanobiAcciaiuoli, Ficino had “very often” told him that as a young man hehad indeed fallen into “pernicious heresy,” but had been saved by theprovidential intervention of the aged archbishop of Florence, Antoninus,an opponent of humanism who had told him to read Aquinas’Summacontra Gentilesas an antidote against his unregulated study of Plato.173Themost direct evidence for such a turnaround comes from Ficino himself, ina letter to Martinus Uranius:168Hankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,vol.i,279(and see his reference to Ficino’s no longerextantInstitutiones Platonicae disciplinae, which seems to have been a digest of Plato’s philosophypieced together from Latin sources).169Ficino, “De laudibus philosophiae” and “De laudibus Medicinae” (Opera,757–760; English trans.inLetters,vol.iii,18–25; see discussion in Hankins, “Development,”460–462); Ficino, “Dequattuor sectis philosophorum” (Kristeller,Supplementum Ficinianumii,7–10); Ficino, “Di Dioet Anima” (ibid.,128–158).170Lorenzo Pisano,De amoreandDialogi quinque, discussed in Field,Origins of the Platonic Academy,158–174, esp.165and167;cf.Hankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,vol.i,276.

For (as Plato also remarks) it is more dangerous toimbibe noxious opinions than the worst poisons.174Testimonies such as this one and the accounts of Pisano’s circle hint atyet another important source of Ficino’s beliefs about the ancient wis-dom. Whereas Plethon had been dismissive of poetry, Ficino undoubtedlysaw it as a genuine source of revelation, at least up to a point.175He fol-lowed Petrarch and Boccaccio in his belief that theprisci theologihad oftenbeenprisci poetaewho had spoken about divine things under the guise ofmythological fable. Petrarch had been explicit in his conviction that “thefirst theologians were the poets”176and Boccaccio had defended the sameconcept of “poetic theology,” with Orpheus and Moses among its majorrepresentatives, in his highly influentialDe genealogia deorum.177We w i l lreturn to the relation between poetic myth and the notion of “hiddenwisdom.”Nothing indicates that the young Ficino was very concerned with thequestion of how to reconcile the primacy of the ancient wisdom with thesuperiority of Christianity, or with safeguarding the primacy of Moses;and indeed it is doubtful whether the question ever assumed any realimportance to him at all. In the introductoryArgumentumto hisPimander(1463), we find a famous genealogy of sixprisci theologi: Mercurius (Hermes)Trismegistus, Orpheus, Aglaophemus, Pythagoras, Philolaus, and Plato.178Except for Hermes, the list was derived from Proclus, but Ficino beginsby quoting Augustine’s opinion that Trismegistus lived several generationsafter Moses.179This has often been interpreted as a position statement aboutMoses’ anteriority with respect to Hermes,180but in fact, it is relativized174Ficino, Letter to Martinus Uranius, in:Opera,933; trans. according to Hankins, “Ficino’s ‘SpiritualCrisis’,”456–457.175See, for example, Allen,Synoptic Art,25; but see how in his letter to Pannonius (see text, below),Ficino sets up Plotinus’ philosophy as superior to the “impious” imagery of the poets.176Petrarch,Epistolae rerum familiarumx.4,in:Lettres famili`eres,vol.iii,280; Petrarch,Invectivecontra medicum,Bk.3,71–92, see Latin original and English trans. in Trinkaus,In Our Image andLikeness,vol.ii,692and864n.19, and see Trinkaus’ general discussion on pp.689–697.177Tr i n k a u s ,In Our Image and Likeness,vol.ii,693–697(with a series of long quotations and theirLatin originals); and cf. the first chapter, “Poetic Theology,” in Wind,Pagan Mysteries,17–25.178Ficino, “Argumentum” (Opera,1836).179Proclus,Theologia Platonicai.5; Augustine,De Civitate Dei18.39.180Also by the present author: Hanegraaff, “Tradition,”1127."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"46The history of truthimmediately by Ficino himself: he notes that this is Augustine’s opinion(“Hoc autem de illo scribit Augustinus”), and continues by offering thealternative views of Cicero and Lactantius, according to whom there wereno fewer than five “Mercuries,” the fifth of whom was Trismegistus.181Ficino merely mentions these opinions, does not take a position himself,and never returns to the question of historical primacy. Therefore evenif he did mean to endorse Augustine’s position, one can hardly say thathe paid much attention to the matter.182In any case, one year later thequestion was settled once and for all, in favor of neither Hermes norMoses: in1464,183and henceforth until the end of his life, Ficino decidedto give preference to Zoroaster as the very earliestpriscus theologus. Inspiredundoubtedly by Plethon’s attribution of theChaldaean Oracles,andbythebiblical story of theMagiinterpreted as Zoroastrians who had worshippedthe Christ Child as “the ultimate Zoroastrian,”184Ficino now made thePersian sage precede not only Hermes Trismegistus, but Moses as well.In fact, associating Zoroaster with both the Chaldaeans and the Persians(and differing in that regard from Plethon, as we have seen), he suggestedthat Abraham himself had already taken the Zoroastrian wisdom withhim when he set out from the city of Ur of the Chaldaeans in quest ofthe promised land.185Accordingly, in Ficino’sPhilebuscommentary (1469)and hisTheologia Platonica(finished in1474), Philolaus vanished from thescene and Zoroaster was added as the very first ancient authority in the list,with Hermes second in rank.186That Ficino assigned to Zoroaster the first place in his chain of wisdomis of considerable importance for understanding how theprisca theologiacould come to be seen, during the Renaissance, as lending support to arevival of magic and occult philosophy. Since the neoplatonic theurgy oftheChaldaean Oracles(known asmagica logiasince Plethon) was attributedto Zoroaster, the chief of theMagiand the most ancient sage, nothing could181The reference is to Cicero,De natura deorumiii.56;andLactantius,Divinae Institutionesi.6.1–3.Cf. van den Broek, “Hermes Trismegistus I,”476–477.182Nevertheless, Ficino’s contemporary Lodovico Lazzarelli did interpret him as adopting Augustine’sposition, and disagreed with it: quoting Diodorus Siculus as his authority, he argued that Hermeslived a long time before Moses (Lazzarelli, first of his “Three Prefaces,”156–157).183Already in hisEpitomae in Minoem, vel de Lege(dated to1464by Kristeller), Ficino placed Zoroasteras lawgiver before both Hermes Trismegistus and Moses (Stausberg,Faszination Zarathushtra,vol.i,122;contrathe usual reference to thePhilebusCommentary of1469as the earliest reference, asin, for example, Hankins, “Development of Ficino’s ‘Ancient Theology’,”461).184Allen,Synoptic Art,37–40.185Ibid.,39.186Ficino, “Commentary . . . on Plato’s Philebus” chapters17,26,29(Allen ed.,180–181,246–247,270–273);Theologia Platonica4.2.1;6.1.7;10.3.5;17.1.2;17.4.4;17.4.11.

Theprisca theologia,inotherwords, became indistinguishable from aprisca magia. Ficino himself wastoo cautious to be very explicit about this implication, but it appears to havebeen expressed without any ambiguity by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola:That divine philosophy of Pythagoras, which they called Magic, belonged to agreat extent to the Mosaic tradition; since Pythagoras had managed to reach theHebrews and their doctrines in Egypt, and knowledge of many of their sacredmysteries. For even the learning of Plato (as is established) comes quite near toHebrew truth; hence many called him a genuine Moses, but speaking Greek.Zoroaster, the son of Oromasius, in practicing magic, took that to be nothingelse but the cult of God and study of divinity; while engaged in this in Persia hethoroughly investigated every virtue and power of nature, in order to know thosesacred and sublime secrets of the divine intellect; which subject many people calledtheurgy, others Cabala or magic.187We will return to the kabbalah as yet another equivalent of the ancientwisdom, and to Pico’s perspective generally. At this point it is importantto see how easily the ancient wisdom could be transformed into apriscamagiaby being attributed to Zoroaster, the chief of theMagi, as its mostancient authority.As Ficino’s ideas about the ancient wisdom developed, the degree ofimportance he attached to pagan sources kept worrying his contempo-raries. A particularly clear testimony is a letter he received in1484or1485from his Hungarian correspondent Johannes Pannonius, who failedto understand how a revival of the non-Christian theology of the ancientscould possibly “serve the cause of providence.”188In his important responseto Pannonius, Ficino summarized his mature perspective on how ancientpaganism is related to the superior religion of Christianity. His argumentrelied on three important points: a notion of religious progress by divineeducation, a notion of concealment and purification, and a distinctionbetween philosophy and religion.189187Pietro Crinito,De honesta disciplina, as printed in Eugenio Garin’s edition of Pico,De HominisDignitate,79–81. English trans. according to Walker,Ancient Theology,50(with minor modifica-tions). While this passage is transmitted secondhand, it fits perfectly with the strong defense ofgood magic in Pico’sOratio, where it is discussed at length, and referred to as “the perfect andhighest wisdom” and “knowledge of divine things” (Pico,Oeuvres philosophiques,54–61; Englishtrans. in Pico,On the Dignity of Man,26–29).188Pannonius, letter to Ficino, in: Ficino,Opera,871; English trans. in Allen,Synoptic Art,5–6.189For a much longer analysis and interpretation of Ficino’s letter to Pannonius, and of his concept ofancient wisdom generally, see the extremely learned and sophisticated discussion in Allen,SynopticArt,chapter1(“Golden Wits, Zoroaster and the Revival of Plato”), to which I am much indebted."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"48The history of truthAs regards the first point, Ficino’s perspective amounted to a new formu-lation of the basic “educational” perspective of thepia philosophia,foundin the patristic apologists, Eusebius in particular. He tells Pannonius thatsince the ancients lived before the birth of Christ, of course one cannotexpect them to have attained the supreme level of Christian truth. How-ever, they were being guided by God towards the truth that would finally berevealed in Christianity. In explaining how divine inspiration has workedin all periods of history and among all peoples, Ficino uses his favoritemetaphors of generation, birth, nurturing, and the gradual growth tomaturity:190Thus it happened that a pious philosophy was born in those days among thePersians under Zoroaster and among the Egyptians under Mercurius, and that eachwas in accord with the other. This pious philosophy was then nurtured among theThracians under Orpheus and Aglaophemus. It reached its early manhood amongthe Greeks and Italians under Pythagoras. At length it came to maturity in Athensunder the divine Plato.191However, the ancient theologians were accustomed to concealing the divinemysteries by means of number symbolism and poetic fable. Only in amuch later period, Ficino writes, was the underlying theology unveiledand laid bare by Plotinus, who, under divine influence, was the first toreally penetrate the secrets of the ancients. But Plotinus himself is diffi-cult, complex and profound, and therefore Ficino himself has now been“destined by God” to translate his writings and comment upon them.When that work is finished, we will finally have direct access to the trueancient philosophy in its purified form: while the poets have been recount-ing the mysteries of piety “impiously,” hiding them under mythologicalimages of pagan deities, and the peripatetics have been responsible forthe world-wide spread of opinions that “completely destroy all religion,”Plotinus gives clear and unambiguous expression to true ancient philoso-phy. In other words: the true wisdom will be definitively divorced fromits association with pagan mythology, and will emerge as obviously su-perior to the “old wives’ tales” of the scholastics. This is how Ficino expectsthe recovery of ancient wisdom will lead to a reform of Christianity inhis own day. He points out explicitly that a “mere simple preaching offaith” will simply not be sufficient. Unless it pleases God to intervenedirectly and restore true religion by means of “the revelation of divinemiracles everywhere,” the intellectuals whose influence over the Church190On Ficino’s preference for such metaphors, cf.

B. Allen, Ficino did not really conceiveof his list of the six earliest sages in terms of strict historical genealogy:rather than assuming a transmission based upon direct contact betweenone sage and the next, he was mainly concerned with a “transmissionof vision” to each of the gentile nations,193without worrying too muchabout logistics.194This fits very well with James Hankins’ thesis that Ficinodistinguished between a period of “inspiration” terminating with Platoamong the gentiles and the last prophets among the Jews, and a secondperiod of “interpretation” beginning with the birth of Christ.195Ficino,I would argue, did not think about the first period in historical terms atall, and this helps explain why the question of Moses’ priority with regardto the gentile sages does not seem to have been of any great concern tohim.196If Moses, the prophets, and the pagan philosophers all had beeninspired by God directly, then the question of who had been first or laterbecomes very much a non-issue. We have seen that it had been a crucialissue for the patristic apologists and their opponents, but although Ficinoinherited a body of texts that had been based upon the premise that earlierwas necessarily better, that premise was no longer so binding or central forhim. In discussions with his critics, the “symbolic capital” at stake was, ashas been suggested above, no longer “Tradition” but “orthodoxy.”197Forthis reason, if Ficino had responded by arguing that the pagan philosopherswere older than Christianity (an argument that, whether accepted or not,192Ibid.,14–15. As pointed out by Allen, Ficino’s reference to the possibility of direct divine interventionthrough miracles cannot be divorced from the popular excitement, in this period, about astrologicaland prophetic speculation concerning the imminent arrival of a “pastor novus,” heralded by a grandconjunction of Jupiter and Saturn (ibid.,24).193For Ficino’s concern with assigning at least one witness of truth to all the gentile cultures or peoples,see Allen,Synoptic Art,25,42with n.88; Hankins, “Development of Ficino’s ‘Ancient Theology’,”464.194Allen,Synoptic Art,25,41. Allen writes that the chain was “a symbolic, not an historically, let alonechronologically, accurate genealogy,” and calls it “a gentile equivalent, so to speak, of the apostolicsuccession.” This latter comparison seems somewhat confusing, since the apostolic successionwould seem to imply precisely a transmission by direct personal contact. I would suggest thatFicino’s own approach was closer to the one highlighted by Henry Corbin with reference toSuhraward ̄ı, i.e. that of the various ancient sages (and their contemporary adherents) as “membersof one spiritual family” who are connected simply by virtue of their participation in the samemetaphysical worldview (Corbin,En Islam Iranien,vol.ii,123; and cf. Walbridge,Wisdom,x).195Hankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,vol.i,283–284.196Even in his letter on “The Harmony between Moses and Plato” (Opera,866–867; English trans.inLetters,vol.vii,9–12), Ficino merely repeats Numenius’ famous statement about Plato being a“Moses speaking attic Greek” (see above, page26) but makes no attempt to discuss his anterioritywith respect to the pagan sages.197See above, page28."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"50The history of truthwould have made perfect sense in the early centuries), Pannonius wouldhave been merely puzzled: he simply would not have seen the point. Buthe might perhaps be impressed if his opponent could demonstrate thatthe pagan writings prefigured Christian doctrine, if only imperfectly, andcould back this up with patristic authority. In thinking about the mostancient period of wisdom, before Plato, the historical and chronologicalconcern with genealogical transmission seems to have receded, in Ficino’smind, in favor of timeless metaphysics: if the divine truth revealed to theancients had been absolute and immutable, and all of them had been inperfect accord about it, this rendered the “search for origins” a somewhatfutile exercise. Even if Zoroaster had been the first, this did not make therest of theprisci theologi“dependent” on him: they really depended ondirect inspiration from God himself.The development of ancient wisdomafterPlato and the Hebrewprophets was a different matter entirely: about this period Ficino doesseem to have thought along historical lines. In terms of Hankins’ distinc-tion between a period of “inspiration” followed by one of “interpretation”this is entirely logical. By definition, divine inspiration must be one andunbroken, and wholly reliable; but human interpretations can diverge, andthey can be wrong. Hence what one might call the “pre-historical” unityof metaphysical truth gave way to a multiplicity of historical opinions, andit should be possible to trace the emergence of correct and false interpreta-tions. In Ficino’s presentation, this takes the shape of a succession of periodsof “veiling” and “unveiling.”198After the initial period of inspiration wasover, the Jews and the gentiles both fell into ignorance and superstition;even most of the post-platonic academies falsified the true tradition, whichsurvived only in the schools of Xenocrates and Ammonius Saccas, and(significantly) thanks to sibyls, priests and divinely inspired poets outsidethe academy.199After the “catastrophic” decline of true wisdom following Plato, it wasrestored in superior form with the coming of Christ and codified in thetheology particularly of St. Paul, St. John the Evangelist, and Dionysius theAreopagite (still considered, of course, as Paul’s contemporary mentioned inActs17:34). However, due to some unknown “calamity in the Church,”200198See Hankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,vol.i,284, whose account I am following here.199Allen,Synoptic Art,62.

Beyond ashadow of doubt I myself have found that the principal mysteries in Numenius,Philo, Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Proclus were in fact received from St. John, St.Paul, Hierotheus and Dionysius the Areopagite. For whatever the Platonists haveto say about the divine mind, about the angels, and about other theological mattersthat strikes one as admirable they clearly appropriated from them.201On these foundations the great Church Fathers, Augustine in particular, re-established the ancient religion in its superior Christian form; but in latercenturies it had evidently become “veiled” again, as the later platoniststhemselves went astray202and the peripatetic sects gained dominance inChristianity. Thanks to divine providence, however, it is now being broughtto light again by the work of Marsilio Ficino.In sum, then, Ficino presents us with a “history of religion” in which theuniversal wisdom goes through three successive periods of decline followedby three restorations:Priscatheologia(Zoroaster–Plato)Christianity1st Rescue ofChristianitythrough theplatonists2nd RescueofChristianitythroughFicino1stcatastrophe:decline ofPlatonicAcademy2ndcatastrophe:unknown“calamity intheChurch”3rdcatastrophe:medievalaristotelian-ismIt is important to emphasize how strongly this perspective differs fromPlethon’s agenda of restoring Hellenistic paganism as an alternativeto Christianity.

As expressed in a famous letter to Paul of Middelburg,Ficino believed that he was living at the beginning of a “new age”: afterthe long darkness of the Middle Ages, the Golden Age was now returning,with Florence as its center.204The recovery of ancient wisdom at this timeand place was ordained by divine providence, and he himself was God’schosen instrument.205The reformed Christianity dreamt of by Ficino did not materialize, orat least not in the way that he was hoping for: less than twenty yearsafter his death it would be superseded by a movement of church reformthat could not have been more different from his ideals.

Rather, Ficino stands at the originof a non-institutional current ofreligiousspeculation, the development ofwhich can be traced in European culture through the sixteenth and into theseventeenth century, and where “Plato” stands as a generic label for a muchwider complex of practices and speculations largely inherited, as we knowtoday, from the Hellenistic culture of late antiquity. We have been referringto it as Platonic Orientalism. This complex phenomenon now became theconceptual foundation of what has been called, in recent scholarship, thebasic “referential corpus”206of Western esotericism. In the course of itsdevelopment from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century, as will be seen,it came to include the various traditions of mystical and occult speculationand practice associated with the names of the “ancient sages,” notablyZoroaster, Hermes, Pythagoras, and Plato. But next to these traditionalbodies of spiritual, theurgical, magical, arithmological, astrological, andalchemical lore (and their complex combinations), the referential corpuscame to include one more traditional current of thought, which has notbeen discussed so far, but was eminently suited for emphasizing the primacyof Moses among the ancient theologians. This, of course, is the kabbalah.secret moses:giovanni pico della mirandola and christian kabbalahIn1486, a young Italian nobleman and intellectual prodigy embarked upona project so grandiose, or megalomaniacal, that one will search in vain forparallels either before him or since. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), then twenty-three years old, was planning to invite a large group ofintellectuals from all over Europe (he offered to pay their expenses), whowould gather in Rome under the leadership of the pope and engage inpublic debate with Pico himself about a series of no fewer than900thesesthat he had written for the occasion. Public disputes of this kind were notunknown at the time, but the number of theses rarely went beyond twentyor twenty-five, and even debates of a single thesis could last for hours oreven days.207Pico’s project was of an altogether different magnitude:The following nine hundred dialectical, moral, physical, mathematical, metaphys-ical, theological, magical, and kabbalistic opinions, including his own and those ofthe wise Chaldaeans, Arabs, Hebrews, Greeks, Egyptians, and Latins, will be dis-puted publicly by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, the Count of Concord...Thedoctrines to be debated are proposed separately by nations and their heresiarchs,206Faivre,Access,6;L’ ́esot ́erisme(3rd edn,2002),8.207Farmer,Syncretism in the West,5–6."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"54The history of truthbut in respect to the parts of philosophy they are intermingled as in a medley,everything mixed together.208Nothing like this had ever been seen before. Pico’s project is like the pla-tonic form of all philosophical debates – an imaginary dispute of universaldimensions by which all problems should be resolved once and for all –and, not surprisingly, it never materialized. After initial censorship of thir-teen specific theses, Pope Innocent VIII eventually condemned all900ofthem in1487, with special emphasis on those “renovating the errors ofpagan philosophers,” those “cherishing the deceits of the Jews,” and thosedevoted to “certain arts, disguising themselves as natural philosophy” (thatis to say, magic). It was the first case in history of a printed book universallybanned by the Church, and almost all copies were burned.209Pico’s project was a supreme (and extreme) example of the ancientwisdom narrative in the Renaissance, as will be seen, but its most innovativefeature was the inclusion of a great number of theses concerned withkabbalah, the secret tradition of the Jews. In both categories of the900theses (those formulated “according to the opinions of others” and those“according to his [Pico’s] own opinion”), they were placed at the very endof the series, as the final culmination of an argument concerned with themost ancient teachers of pagan wisdom and their disciplines. In so doing,Pico became the founder of a new tradition known as Christian kabbalah,which would be taken up by numerous authors after him and developedinto one of the most important currents of Western esotericism in the earlymodern period.210Research of this phenomenon has been flourishing in recent decades,211with numerous specialists investigating how Christian intellectuals beganstudying the sources of kabbalah and other Jewish traditions212in an208Pico,900Theses, First Preface (in: Farmer,Syncretism in the West,210–211).209Farmer,Syncretism in the West,x,16.210On earlier usages of kabbalistic arguments by converted Jews, see Scholem, “Beginnings of theChristian Kabbalah”; McGinn, “Cabalists and Christians.” Pico’s novelty lies not only in the factthat he was the first Christian of non-Jewish origin who used kabbalah for Christian-apologeticends, as emphasized by Scholem, but also in the fact that his Christian kabbalah was a specificmanifestation ofprisca theologia(as correctly stated by Mallary Masters, “Renaissance Kabbalah,”140andpassim).211The most important general studies and collective volumes, in chronological order, are Blau,Christian Interpretation of the Cabala; Scholem, “Beginnings of the Christian Kabbalah” (1954orig.“Zur Geschichte der Anf ̈ange”; the English translation is based upon the revised and expandedFrench version, “Consid ́erations sur l’histoire”); Secret,Kabbalistes Chr ́etiens;Secret,Herm ́etismeet Kabbale;Dan,Christian Kabbalah;Kilcher,Sprachtheorie der Kabbala; Schmidt-Biggemann,Christliche Kabbala.212As pointed out by Joseph Dan, numerous Talmudic and midrashic materials were misunderstoodas “kabbalah” by its Christian enthusiasts, and, conversely, they were very selective in their usage"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Secret Moses: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Christian kabbalah55attempt to integrate these materials within their own theological and philo-sophical frameworks. In the wake of this research it is becoming ever moreevident that the influence went both ways: the emergence of Christiankabbalah had, in turn, a significant impact on how Jewish kabbalah itselfdeveloped during the Renaissance, which makes the phenomenon highlyrelevant to the study of Jewish culture in early modern Europe.213The newwave of scholarly research in these domains has led to a new appreciation ofboth the significance and the complexity of Jewish–Christian relations inthe early modern period, which in turn fits the emerging view of Europeanreligion as a highly pluralistic field of competing discourses.214Now if one tries to reach clarity about the relation between Christiankabbalah and the Renaissance discourse of ancient wisdom, one makes aninteresting discovery. For obvious reasons of linguistic competence, the bulkof research concerned with Christian kabbalah is written by scholars witha strong background in Jewish studies, who tend to perceive it primarilyas a phenomenon of Jewish–Christian interaction. Probably because ofthis focus, they usually mention theprisca theologiaonly in passing, as aneighboring but presumably somewhat separate phenomenon concernedwith pagan rather than Jewish sources. The main exception to this rule isMoshe Idel, to whose work I will return. On the other hand, scholars whowrite about theprisca theologiaorphilosophia perennisof the Renaissancetend to concentrate on the relation between Christianity and pagan sources,and rarely give much attention to Christian kabbalah.215Against the background of my previous discussions, this is clearly unfor-tunate: Christian kabbalah must be seen as a typical, although specific,manifestation of the ancient wisdom narrative, not as a separateof actual Jewish kabbalistic sources (Dan, “Kabbalah of Johannes Reuchlin,”62–67; “ChristianKabbalah,” esp.126–129). It is interesting to compare Dan’s analysis with Idel’s: whereas the formerstates that the Christian kabbalists minimalized the sefirotic system and mistakenly consideredcommon midrashic methodologies (gematria,temurah) as specifically kabbalistic, the latter claimsexactly the opposite (Idel, “Reflections on Kabbalah in Spain,”9).213Idel, “Kabbalah, Platonism andPrisca Theologia,”208–209andpassim; Idel, “Jewish Kabbalahand Platonism”; Idel, “Jewish Thinkers versus Christian Kabbalah,”57–60; Ruderman,Kabbalah,Magic, and Science,139–160(at the example of Abraham ben Hananiah Yagel).214See, for example, von Stuckrad, “Christian Kabbalah and Anti-Jewish Polemics”; and for thegeneral trend of “European History of Religions,” see the newJournal of Religion in EuropeandKippenberg, R ̈upke, and von Stuckrad,Europ ̈aische Religionsgeschichte.215The neglect may have resulted simply from the influence of Schmitt and Walker, who put theprisca theologiaandphilosophia perennison the scholarly agenda (see above, nn.7–8)andwhosepresentations seem to have been adopted by later scholars as “models” for what the two terms wereall about. Schmitt’s discussion of Pico is notable for the near-absence of any reference to Jewishkabbalah (“Perennial Philosophy,”511–513, with only a passing mention of “Hebrew mystics”).Walker, on the other hand, calls the absence of kabbalah in his book a “grave omission” resultingonly from his personal inability to read Hebrew and Aramaic (Ancient Theology,14)."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"56The history of truthdevelopment.216It is crucial to appreciate the subtle point that Pico dellaMirandola, Johannes Reuchlin, and those who followed in their wake,werenotconcerned with Jewish esotericism on its own terms, but with theancient and universal wisdom as they saw it. Simply because this wisdomwas true and divine in its very nature and origin, it was “Christian” bydefinition, regardless of where it was found: hence, the kabbalah was notreally the property of the Jews at all, but had merely been preserved bythem. It followed that the Jews would surely have to convert to Christianityonce the true secret of their own tradition was revealed to them.This entire line of reasoning was adopted straight from the patristicapologists,including– and this is the crucial point – their insistence onMoses as the original and most ancient source of wisdom. The only dif-ference was that whereas the Fathers had been concerned with proving theanteriority of the Mosaic Law with respect to pagan scriptures, Christiankabbalists believed they had made a sensational new discovery: Moses hadreceived from God not only the written Law intended for all, but also amore profound teaching of secret theology reserved for the few:Moses on the mountain received from God not only the law, which, as writtendown in five books, he left to posterity, but also a more secret and true interpretationof the law. But God commanded him to publish the law indeed to the people,yet not to pass on in writing the interpretation of the law, or to make it generallyknown, but to reveal it himself under a great oath of silence [magna silentiireligione] to Jesus Nave alone, who in turn should unveil it to the other highpriests succeeding him.217To the extent that they were in accord with this original kabbalah, and couldbe interpreted from that perspective, the philosophies of the pagan nationsparticipated in the true religion. This is why kabbalistic materials play acrucial role not only in Pico’s kabbalistic theses, but also in the Hermetic,Zoroastrian/Chaldaean, Magical, and Orphic ones.218But whereas thereligions of the Persians, Egyptians or Greeks had long been superseded bythe advent of Christianity and now survived only through textual remains,the kabbalah survived as alivingtradition in Pico’s own time!219All thatremained, therefore, was to enlighten its adherents about its true meaning:the Jews could now be converted to the Christian message by showing that216This point is made only rarely in the secondary literature (see, for example, Mallary Masters,“Renaissance Kabbalah”; Toussaint, “Ficin,”69with n.20; Black,Pico’s Heptaplus,95–97).217Pico,Oratio(Opera Omniai,328–329).

Once they wouldaccept Jesus Christ as the messiah, the way would be clear for all peoplesto unite under the banner of the ancient and universal wisdom.The conversion of the Jews to Christianity was, of course, a topic rife withmillenarian implications. As pointed out by Steven Farmer, Pico wantedhis great debate to begin on January6, the feast of Epiphany and “symbolicdate of the submission of the pagangentesto Christ in the persons oftheMagi.”220Again, therefore, we encounter the basic motif of the “wisemen from the east” confronted with the superior religion of Christ. ButPico’s ambition went well beyond anything that Ficino had imagined, andhad Plethon been alive, he would no doubt have been horrified: as thedebate over the900theses would reach its culmination (with a victoriousPico, of course) not only would the pagan sages be seen as bowing downsymbolically before the truth of the gospel, but the Jews would submitthemselves to Christ quite literally, as it dawned on them that Jesus hadbeen the true secret of their own ancient traditions all along.221Farmersuggests that although we can obviously never be sure, Pico may haveseriously considered the possibility that “his Vatican debate would endwith the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse crashing through the Romanskies.”222This, then, was the missionary dream to which Pico devoted himself andwhich was taken up by Reuchlin and his successors. Clearly the projecthad very little to do with attitudes of religious tolerance, irenism, or anappreciation of Judaism on its own terms. On the contrary, it was thor-oughly apologetic and polemic,adversus Iudaeos, pro Christianis.223Pico’sown statements are clear about this point:If they agree with us anywhere, we shall order the Hebrews to stand by the ancienttraditions of their fathers; if anywhere they disagree, then drawn up in Catholiclegions we shall make an attack upon them. In short, whatever we detect foreign tothe truth of the Gospels we shall refute to the extent of our power, while whatever220Farmer,Syncretism in the West,4,43–44.221For how Pico found the name of Jesus in the Hebrew tetragrammaton, see especially his kabbalistictheses “according to his own opinion”11>6,11>7,11>14,11>15(Farmer,Syncretism in the West,522–523,526–527) and useful short discussion in Schmidt-Biggemann, “Einleitung,”18–19.

In a long series of publications, but most explicitlyin an article published in2002,225he has proposed to distinguish between“unilinear” and “multilinear” perspectives on the origin of religious truth,and this argument is sufficiently relevant for us to briefly discuss it here. Inall likelihood it was originally inspired by a passage in a classic article byD. P. Walker, where he distinguished between the “orthodox” (and patris-tic) idea of a transmission from Moses to the gentiles and the less orthodoxalternative of “partial pre-Christian revelations other than that given to theJews.”226In Idel’s formulation, a unilinear perspective means that there hasbeen one single line of transmission starting with Moses, as opposed tothe more radical and controversial multilinear view according to which thetruth has been revealed separately to both pagan and monotheistic spiritualleaders.227Idel’s uni/multilinear distinction seems to make sense at first sight, butI believe its usefulness evaporates once an attempt is made to apply it.An initial problem is that there is no particular reason why unilinearitywould automatically imply a Mosaic origin: it is quite possible to envisiona unilinear transmission starting with a pagan sage, such as Zoroaster in thecases of Plethon and Ficino, or Hermes in the case of Lodovico Lazzarelli.228Furthermore, Idel claims that the unilinear theory was developed “mostlyby Jewish authors” whereas Christians were “fascinated more” by themultilinear view,229or in other words: Christians were largely tempted bya “paganizing” perspective whereas the Jews held on more firmly to their224Pico,Heptaplus,Proemto3rd exposition (Opera Omniai,23).

The case of Lazzarelli proves beyond any doubt that unilinearnon-Mosaic perspectives could indeed exist in the Renaissance. HisCrater Hermetis3.1–2(and cf.the first of his “Three Prefaces,” as in n.182, above) could not be more explicit: Lazzarelli quotesPorphyry’s statement that “The first of those who began to pass on the tradition were those whodrank the clear waves of the Nile,” and continues by stating about Hermes that “it was by way ofhim that wisdom reached the Hebrews. For Moses, who was a Hebrew born in Egypt, transferredit to the Hebrews . . . ” (Hanegraaff and Bouthoorn,Lodovico Lazzarelli,171–173).229Idel, “Prisca Theologia,”139,141."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Secret Moses: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Christian kabbalah59monotheistic identity. However, although their perspective was supposedlydominated by multilinearity, Idel has to concede that Christians did notactually expound that theory in a very elaborate manner;230and I will arguebelow that whereas Idel interprets Pico della Mirandola as a multilinearist,he was in fact a firm believer in Mosaic origins. As for Ficino, it is onlywith the greatest trouble that Idel manages to force him into a multilinearmold, more or less.231Herethecoreproblem,inmyopinion,liesintheunquestioned assumption thatprisca theologiaimplies linear genealogies atall. As I argued above, Ficino probably thought of the ancient wisdom up toPlato as “pre-historical” in a quite literal sense. It did not really matter thatmuch to him whether the divine revelation had been received by Persians,Egyptians, Greeks or Jews, for it had always been “Christian” in essence andby definition, for the simple reason that it came from the one true God.What ultimately undermines Idel’s theory, then, is its neglect of a third,nonlinear option which emphasizes the wisdom of an era in which timeitself had barely begun: a notion that may sound exceedingly strange to themodern historian, but came quite naturally to metaphysicians living in aperiod when our brand of historical consciousness was still in its infancy.It has been claimed that Pico’s system of extreme syncretism232wasessentially concerned with placing all philosophies in parallel, while show-ing no attempt at developing a “developmental history.”233I believe thisis true only up to a point. Pico’s major writings in which kabbalah playa role are in fact predicated upon the common patristic thesis that, asformulated in hisOratiowith direct reference to Eusebius, “all wisdomflowed from the barbarians to the Greeks, and from the Greeks to us,”234and the most ancient barbarian source in his opinion was Moses. WhenPico begins discussing the various ancient wisdom traditions in his famousOratiowritten for the opening of the debate, he does indeed begin withMoses and calls him “scarcely inferior to the fountain fullness of holy and230Ibid.,145. Cf. the similar criticism in Ruderman,Kabbalah, Magic, and Science,142with n.13.Inan article on Menasseh ben Israel, Idel interprets him as unilinear, but also quotes his statementthat ancient pagan philosophers had discovered the soul’s immortality “by means of natural lightalone” (“Kabbalah, Platonism and Prisca Theologia,”212): a viewpoint that in his terms wouldclearly qualify as multilinear.231Idel, “Prisca Theologia,”145–147: he first attributes a multilinear reading of Ficino to Kristeller anda unilinear one to Schmitt, then discusses (and rejects) a third “developmental” reading attributedto Hankins and adds a “double truth” approach as a fourth alternative, only to conclude at theend that “Ficino’s real views” must have been unilinear.232On Pico as a syncretistic thinker, see the Introductory Monograph in Farmer,Syncretism in theWest,1–179.233Schmidt-Biggemann, “Einleitung,”9.234Pico,Oratio(Opera Omniai,325). English trans. by Charles Glenn Wallis, in: Pico della Mirandola,On the Dignity of Man(Miller ed.),23–24."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"60The history of truthinexpressible intelligence.”235In other words, Moses was just one degreebelow the divine source itself from whom he received his wisdom. Display-ing a more explicit sense of temporality than Ficino, Pico therefore pointsto Moses as the most ancient theologian.Having discussed the main pagan (Greek, Chaldaean, Egyptian) tradi-tions, Pico returns to Moses in order to reveal the true secret on which theyall depend. From an obscure reference in Ecclesiasticus46:1to a certainJesus son of Nave (see quotation, above), described as “the successor ofMoses in prophecies” who was “made great for the saving of the elect inGod,” Pico concludes that this person must therefore have been the firstinheritor of Moses’ secret wisdom, the kabbalah, who in turn passed it onto the other high priests. He then continues by stating that the ancientphilosophers (Pythagoras, the Egyptian priests, Plato, and also Aristotle)faithfully maintained this custom of secrecy, as did Jesus himself. Althoughhe does not write explicitly that the pagan sages derived their wisdomfrom the Mosaic tradition (or indicate who among them was the first todo so), this clearly implies that they at least participated in its lineage ofsuccession. The secret interpretation of the Torah was called kabbalah, orreceptio, meaning that it was passed on not by the written word but orallyfrom man to man. Only after the Babylonian captivity, under Esdras, wasit finally written down in seventy volumes, to preserve it from getting lost.This ancient and secret Mosaic wisdom has now finally reached theChristians, who are capable of perceiving the great truth to which the Jewsthemselves are blind: that their most ancient and most sacred tradition isin fact Christian! Pico’s formulation is famous, and must be quoted herein full:When I had procured myself these books at no small expense and had read themthrough with the greatest diligence and unwearied labor, I saw in them (God is mywitness) a religion not so much Mosaic as Christian. There is the mystery of theTrinity, there the incarnation of the Word, there the divinity of the Messiah; thereI read the same things on original sin, on Christ’s atonement for it, on the heavenlyJerusalem, on the fall of demons, on the orders of angels, on purgatory, on thepunishments of hell, which we daily read in Paul and Dionysius, in Jerome andAugustine. In those matters that regard philosophy, you may really hear Pythagorasand Plato, whose doctrines are so akin to Christian faith that our Augustine givesgreat thanks to God that the books of the Platonists came into his hands. In short,235Pico,Oratio(Opera Omniai,319). English trans.: Miller ed.,12. In my opinion, Boulnois andTognon’s commentary (Pico,Oeuvres philosophiques,25–27n.14) misses the mark in reading thereference to “inferiority” (paulum deminutum) as an indication of Moses’ limitations rather thanof his closeness to the divine source."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Secret Moses: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Christian kabbalah61there is hardly any dispute between us and the Hebrews on this wherein theycannot be disproved and refuted from the books of the Kabbalists, that there is nocorner left in which they can hide.236Everything indicates, then, that Pico indeed believed in a succession ofwisdom that began with Moses. From the Hebrews it had somehow “flown”to other “barbarian” peoples and to the Greeks; but details such as whetherthe latter learned about it only by mediation of Chaldaeans or Egyptians, ordirectly from the Hebrews, or both, simply do not seem to interest him. Hiscentral concern is not with historical genealogies, but with the apologeticnotion that Christians can find their basic doctrines back in the mostancient source of secret theology, the kabbalah, and that important tracesof it have been preserved by pagan authors as well. Again, this is simplyanother restatement of the basic patristic perspective, only expanded now toinclude the new factor of kabbalah; nothing in Pico’s statements (or in thoseattributed to him by Pietro Crinito)237requires us to assume a deliberate“multilinear” doctrine of independent pagan revelations, although nothingrefutes it either. Such a doctrine is simply not there.In conclusion, then, the primacy accorded to “Secret Moses” is a constantin Pico’s oeuvre, but we do not find any attempt to establish a precise orderof successionafterthe initial transmission from God to Moses to Jesus sonof Nave and the rest of the priesthood. Pico seems concerned only withthe broadest outlines of what we have been calling a Platonic Orientalistperspective, and with emphasizing the centrality of the Hebrews amongthem.238The historiographical question of how, and by what routes, divinewisdom might have been transmitted among those peoples does not seemto interest him; and even the question of possible pagan revelations nextto the one given to Moses seems very much a non-issue.239While it was Pico who set the stage for Christian kabbalah as a specificmanifestation of the ancient wisdom narrative, later authors in that tradi-tion of course introduced their own variations. For example, in hisDe verbo236Pico,Oratio(Opera Omniai,330). English trans.: Miller ed.,32.237See above, page47with n.187. The same passages are quoted by Idel in his argument for a“multilinear” Pico (“Prisca Theologia,”142–143).238This is further confirmed by the ordering of Pico’s900theses, which are divided into twoparts, both running in counter-chronological order culminating in the most ancient sources ofwisdom: Pythagoras, the Chaldaeans, Hermes Trismegistus, and the Kabbalists in the first part,and Pythagorean mathematics and numbers, Zoroaster and the Chaldaeans, magic, the Orphichymns, and again the kabbalah in the second.239For example, at the beginning of theHeptaplushe gives the commonplace reference to Moseshaving been “learned in all the lore of the Egyptians,” but ignores the obvious question of whetherthis implies a dependence of Moses on Egyptian wisdom, or what this implies for the nature orspecial status of the kabbalah he received on the mountain."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"62The history of truthmirifico(1494) Johannes Reuchlin shows a bit more interest in the tradi-tional accounts of ancient Greek philosophers (Thales, Pythagoras, Plato)traveling to the countries of the barbarians. But as with Pico, his pointis to emphasize the superiority and primacy of the Mosaic revelation:240who could doubt, he writes, that thinkers who had traveled all the way toEgypt driven by their ardent desire for the truth would not have visitedJudaea as well, so that “after having tasted from the streams, they mightdrinkfromthefountainaswell”?241But while he is clearly concerned withplacing Moses first in a line of temporal succession, he also suggests thatbecause these earliest phases of human history are so close to the divineorigin, they somehow partake of eternity as much as of temporality: “Theancient approaches the primordial, the primordial borders on the eternal,and the eternal is close to God, who rules over eternity.”242In other words,somewhat similar to what we found in Ficino’s “period of inspiration,”moving backwards to the very divine origin one gradually leaves time andhistory behind: according to a paradoxical logic reminiscent of Cusanus,if the eternal comes “first” and time comes “second,” the search for theultimate origin can be successful only if it will never end . . .Interestingly, in his much laterDe arte cabalistica(1517), Reuchlindeparted from the Mosaic lineage and traced the origins of kabbalah fur-ther back than ever, although remaining within the confines of biblicalrevelation: it was now Adam himself who had first received some form ofkabbalah after the Fall, as an essentially messianic doctrine by which manwould be restored to his original state of felicity (the reference being, ofcourse, to Jesus).243From there it was handed on from generation to gen-eration, and although it was certainly passed on by Moses, Reuchlin putsremarkably little emphasis on the latter’s role.244As for his central Greekauthor, Pythagoras, Reuchlin was quite vague about where, how and fromwhom he learned his wisdom, except for the insistence that they were all240Reuchlin,De verbo mirifico,Bk.2(Ehlerset al.ed.,164–167). Reuchlin continues by discussing theyounger origins of the Greeks (ibid.,166–169) and, with even more emphasis, the Egyptians (ibid.,169–173), who are treated quite negatively throughout this work. Among the pagans, Zoroasteris considered the most ancient authority (ibid.,162–163,174–175). The Brahmans and Druids areeven younger than the Greeks (ibid.,176–177). When Reuchlin finally reveals the nature of the“wonder-working word” (the tetragrammaton verbalized so as to produce the name of Jesus), thisultimate kabbalistic secret is set in the sharpest opposition to pagan superstitions and sorceries ofall kinds (ibid.,380–381,386–389).241Reuchlin,De verbo mirifico,Bk.1(Ehlerset al.ed.,104–105).242Reuchlin,De verbo mirifico,Bk.2(Ehlerset al.ed.,162–163).243Reuchlin,De arte cabalistica,Bk.1(Goodman ed.,72–73).244See Reuchlin’s discussion of biblical history from Adam to Moses,De arte cabalistica,Bk.1(Goodman ed.,73–81)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Secret Moses: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Christian kabbalah63barbarians: he “got it partly from the Egyptians, partly from the Hebrewsand Chaldaeans, partly from the deeply learned Persian Magi,”245but inany case not from the Greeks or Romans.246In other words, the orientalistperspective remains strongly in evidence; but Christian kabbalah had bynow mutated into aprisca theologiaderived neither from pagan nor fromMosaic wisdom, but from Adam himself.We do not need to trace these and other mutations in any furtherdetail here, fascinating though they are. Our main point so far has been toestablish that Christian kabbalah, although a new phenomenon, emergedas a specific manifestation of the more general Renaissance narrative ofancient wisdom. Once it existed, however, and as Christians began to delvemore deeply into Jewish kabbalistic literature, they found that they hadentered a strange new world: one based upon exegetical techniques andgeneral modes of thinking that had no parallel in any type of religiousspeculation familiar to them. As Chaim Wirszubski remarks in his classicstudy, Pico set out to prove the Christian truth by means of Jewish kabbalah,but “as thesis after thesis yields up its secrets, a remarkable thing emerges:Pico’s [kabbalistic theses] evidently outgrew their original purpose.”247Thesame can be said about Christian kabbalah as a whole. In the attempt toapply midrashic techniques such asgematria,temurahandnotarikon, whichhad formerly been restricted to Jewish circles, within a broader symbolicframework based upon new concepts such as the tensefirotand the manydivine names, unheard-of new possibilities seemed to open up for scripturalexegesis and metaphysical speculation. Not only did the biblical text revealhidden levels of meaning never suspected before, but the correspondencesthat could be established with pagan mythology and philosophy seemedsimply stupefying. It began to look as if all domains of knowledge werelinked together by a web of secret, hidden, invisible connections, and Picoseemed to have discovered the hermeneutical key that could make themvisible.248245Reuchlin,De arte cabalistica,Bk.2(Goodman ed.,212–213,cf.128–129).246Reuchlin,De arte cabalistica,Bk.2(Goodman ed.,128–129).247Wirszubski,Pico della Mirandola’s Encounter,186.248Still, how careful one must be in suspecting profound kabbalistic secrets in Pico’s riddles mightbe demonstrated by the example of the first thesis quoted by Wirszubski to illustrate his state-ment quoted in the text. Seventeenth kabbalistic thesis “according to his own opinion” (Farmer,Syncretism,526–527): “Whoever knows what the purest wine is among the kabbalists, understandswhy David saysI will be made drunk by the abundance of your dwelling, and what drunkenness theancient seer Musaeus says is happiness, and what so many Bacchae mean in Orpheus.” The thesismight suggest deep kabbalistic correspondences between David and the ancient Greeks, but themystery evaporates once it is discovered that everything except the reference to the purest wine istaken simply from a passage in Ficino’s commentary on theRepublic(Opera,1399)."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"64The history of truthThis discovery of hidden, or “occult,” correspondences and the meansto decipher them is best understood against a background that was alreadybriefly mentioned above, with reference to Petrarch and Boccaccio: the ideathat theprisci theologihad often beenprisci poetaewho had spoken aboutdivine things under the guise of mythological fable. This assumption madeit possible for pagan mythology to play a serious role in Christian theology,since it meant that beneath the external surface of stories about the gods,one could discover their hidden secret: the ancient wisdom concordantwith Christian truth.249Pico at one time even planned to write a bookentitledPoetica Theologia:It was the opinion of the ancient theologians that divine subjects and the secretMysteriesmustnotberashlydivulged...theEgyptianshadsculptedsphinxesinall their temples, for no other reason than to indicate that divine things, evenwhen they are committed to writing, must be covered with enigmatic veils andpoeticdissimulation...Howthatwasdone...byLatinandGreekpoetsweshallexplain in the book of our Poetic Theology.250In other words: “ancient wisdom” equaled “hidden wisdom.” It may wellbe argued that the notions of secrecy and concealment are inherent in thevery structure of the Renaissance narrative of ancient wisdom,251for thesimple reason that, in one way or another, its Christian adherents alwaysneeded to make the argument that beneath the surface crust of paganreligion there lay a hidden core of Christian truth.Pico’s fascination with secrecy and concealment, however, went farbeyond anything found in Ficino, and would become crucial for the sub-sequent development of the discourse on ancient wisdom. Pico seems tohave enjoyed obscurity for its own sake, and reveled in the pleasure ofmystifying his audience: for example, writing to a friend about his firstessay in the philosophy of myths, he boasts that it is “filled with manymysteries from the secret philosophy of the ancients,” and written in suchexotic language that it would be “intelligible only to a few.”252In all hismain writings, he kept emphasizing secrecy as a fundamental dimension of249The classic discussion of this topic is Trinkaus,In our Image and Likeness,vol.ii,689–697.250Pico,Commento, Libro Terzo, Cap.xi, Stanza Nona (Garin ed.,581). Note that in the printededition of1519(used by De Angelis in his1994edition, see his page133), the mention of “poeticdissimulation” had vanished and “Poetic Theology” had become “Poetic Philosophy.” See also, forexample, Pico,Oratio(Opera Omniai,331): “Orpheus covered the mysteries of his doctrines withthe wrappings of fables, and disguised them with a poetic garment.”251Thus Walker, “Prisca Theologiain France”: “The whole structure of theprisca theologiarests on thebelief that ancient theologians wrote with deliberate obscurity, veiling the truth, and, correlatively,that religious texts should be interpreted allegorically.”252Pico to Baldus Perusinus, in: Dorez, “Lettres in ́edites,”357–358."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Secret Moses: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Christian kabbalah65the ancient wisdom,253while cultivating a deliberate practice of speakingin riddles so that his words might be “published and yet not published”(editos esse et non editos).254Although it could easily be defended withreference to Pythagoreanism and other traditions of Greek antiquity, theconcept of ancient wisdom as “hidden wisdom” was raised to a new levelof prominence due to Pico’s introduction of kabbalah; and the resultingcombination was made even more potent by the addition of yet anotheringredient pioneered by Pico, that of the symbolism of numbers.255Thedialectics of concealment and revelation are central to Jewish kabbalah,256and were obviously highlighted even more because of Pico’s emphasis onits status as the secret revelation to Moses:To disclose to the people the more secret mysteries, things hidden under the barkof the law and the rough covering of words, the secrets of the highest divinity, whatwould that have been other than to give what is holy to dogs and to cast pearlsamong swine? Consequently it was not human prudence but a divine commandto keep these things secret from the people, and to communicate them only to theperfect.257Kabbalistic truth was not kept hidden merely for elitist reasons, but alsobecause its mysteries resisted verbalization: too subtle and refined to becaught in the either/or categories of discursive logic, kabbalistic truthrequired a paradoxical language in which any statement implied its owndenial.258Pertaining to levels of reality higher up on the platonic scale ofbeing, and therefore far more abstract than the concrete domain of thesenses, supreme metaphysical verities could be approximated by means ofcomplex linguistic and numerical calculations, and intuited by the intel-lect or the mind, but not grasped or comprehended fully and directly. Asformulated by Joseph Dan, the basic perspective implied a “rejection of253See for example hisOratio(Opera Omniai,328–329) or the opening passages in the first Proemof theHeptaplus(ibid.,1–5). And see the general discussion in Wind,Pagan Mysteries,8–11,andcf.17–22. These influential pages remain important for our topic in spite of Wind’s gratuitousdisdain for Platonic Orientalism (typical of his generation, as we have seen): see, for example, page10about Pico’s fondness for “Asiatic richness” or page22about the Renaissance “recrudescence ofthat ugly thing which has been called ‘late-antique syncretism’.”254Referring here to Aristotle in hisMetaphysics,in:Oratio(Opera Omniai,329).255On this important current, see Brach,Simbolismo dei numeri; “Number Symbolism”; “Mathemat-ical Esotericism.”256See, for example, Idel,Kabbalah,253–256; Wolfson, “Beyond the Spoken Word”; Halbertal,Concealment and Revelation.257Pico,Oratio(Opera Omniai,329).258For Jewish kabbalah specifically, this point has been emphasized in particular by Elliott Wolfson:see hisLanguage, Eros, Being.

Schmidt-Biggemann, “History and Prehistory”)."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"66The history of truthcommunicative language as an expression of truth, and the claim that inthe non-semantic layers of language ancient wisdom is hidden.”259WhenReuchlin defined the kabbalah as “symbolic philosophy,”260he meantsomething very similar; and an understanding of symbols as ambigu-ous mediators that simultaneously reveal and conceal spiritual realitieshas been seen as common to both the Jewish kabbalah and its Christianinterpretations.261The complex linguistic and scriptural hermeneutics of Jewish and Chris-tian kabbalah have been discussed at great length elsewhere.262For ourpurposes, it is important mainly to emphasize that in the wake of Pico andReuchlin, not only did kabbalah become an integral part of the Renaissancediscourse of ancient wisdom, but this innovation resulted in a very strongemphasis on “esotericism” in the specific sense of a concern with hiddenor concealed secrets and the possibility of discovering or revealing them.263As has been argued, such concerns were already implied by the very con-cept that Christian truths lay concealed under the surface of ancient paganmyths and philosophies, but could be uncovered by means of allegorical orsymbolical exegesis. This potential now came to full development under theinfluence of a tradition, the Jewish kabbalah, which had always been eso-teric to its very core.264It lies entirely in the line of this development that –to give only one famous example – when Heinrich Cornelius Agrippapublished his great compendium of ancient wisdom in1533, he called itDe occulta philosophia: on hidden philosophy. His well-known dedicatoryletter to Johannes Trithemius confirms that he saw his work as an attempt259Dan, “Christian Kabbalah,”117n.1. Cf. Dan, “In Quest of a Historical Definition of Mys-ticism,”79: “Mysticism is the negation of the veracity of communicative language, and thebelief in a non-communicative truth lying in a symbolical fashion deep within revealed divinelanguage.”260Reuchlin,De arte cabalistica, Dedication to Pope Leo X (Goodman ed.,38–39). Cf. Scholem,“Stellung der Kabbala,”11, about Reuchlin’s understanding of kabbalah asreceptio symbolica.261For Scholem’s perspective, see Biale,Gershom Scholem,89–92;andcf.thecomparisonbetweenScholem and Dan in Hanegraaff, “On the Construction,”47–54. Moshe Idel has criticized Scholemfor over-emphasizing the importance of symbolic language in kabbalah at the expense of otherdimensions, suggesting that he essentially “adopted Reuchlin’s vision on the nature of Kabbalahas quintessentially symbolic, but formulated his vision of symbolism under the impact of Goetheand Benjamin” (“Jewish Thinkers versus Christian Kabbalah,”63–65).262See, for example, Scholem, “Name Gottes und die Sprachtheorie”; Kilcher,Sprachtheorie derKabbala; Wolfson,Language, Eros, Being; Idel,Absorbing Perfections.263This specific understanding of “esotericism” as pertaining to secrecy and concealment is basicto Jewish kabbalah but cannot be simply transposed to “Western esotericism” (see Hanegraaff,“Esotericism”).264See, for example, Dan’s references to the traditional termsba’aley sod(“esoterics”) andtorat ha-sod(“esoteric lore”) for what came to be described as Jewish “mysticism” due to the success of Scholem’sgreat studies (“In Quest,”62with n.6; “Christian Kabbalah,”117n.1)."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Secret Moses: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Christian kabbalah67to revive the science of theMagiand other sages of antiquity,265and itsthird and final book was dominated by kabbalah. One might say, then, thatthissummaperfectly encapsulates all the main developments I have beentracing so far: the ancient wisdom of the pagan sages (seen as includingmagic and the other so-called “occult sciences”),266the kabbalah receivedby Moses, and the notion of a hidden philosophy grounded in Christiantruth.The increasing emphasis on secrecy and concealment within the ancientwisdom discourse of the Renaissance resulted largely from a confluence oftraditional sources and authorities. The main factors mentioned so far havebeen the basic notion (implicit in the patristic perspective) of Christianityas the hidden core of ancient paganism; the understanding of thepriscitheologiasprisci poetaehiding the truth under the guise of mythologicalfable; the frequent allusions in “Platonic Orientalist” authors to the needfor secrecy, oral transmission from master to disciple, and initiations intomysteries reserved for the few; concepts of symbolism and allegory asalternatives to aristotelian logic and discursive language; the dialectics ofconcealment and revelation central to Jewish kabbalah; the very natureof the new exegetical techniques as tools for revealing hidden dimensionsof the sacred texts; not to mention a personal taste for mystery-mongeringin authors such as Pico. To all these factors must be added the very simplebut basic one of caution: being perceived as an apologist of paganism,Judaism, or the magical arts could be dangerous. Because of its very nature,one will rarely find references to this factor in official printed sources, but itdoes turn up in private correspondence. To give one example: in a letter bythe German humanist Mutianus Rufus to his close friend Heinrich Urban(1505), one reads these radical statements:There is one God and one Goddess. But as there are many divinities [numina]there are likewise many names [nomina]: Jupiter, Sol, Apollo, Moses, Christus,Luna, Ceres, Proserpina, Tellus, Maria.

Mutianus Rufus’ evidentawareness that such ideas must be kept hidden leads us to the basic questionof how the ancient wisdom narrative was related to religious orthodoxy.Initially the answer might seem clear: Gemistos Plethon had been accusedof being a pagan subversive, Ficino’s love for the ancient sages worried hisfriends, Pico’s theses were condemned by the pope, and Agrippa’s writingson magic caused him to be perceived (very unfairly) as a black magicianin league with the devil. The list could easily be expanded. Do we thenhave to conclude that, in spite of its patristic foundations, the ancientwisdom narrative was perceived as heretical and alien to the doctrines ofthe Church? Before drawing such conclusions, let us consult the librarianof the Vatican.the universal catholic: agostino steucoSince the last decades of the fifteenth century, starting from Italy butspreading toward other countries such as France and Germany, the ancientwisdom narrative came to dominate the assumptions of what might becalled the “esoteric clerisy” of early modern Europe.268In the wake of Ficinoand Pico, it deeply informed the thinking of greater or lesser authors suchas Lodovico Lazzarelli, Symphorien Champier, Jacques Lef`evre d’Etaples,Franc ̧ois Foix de Candale, Francesco Giorgio da Veneto, Johannes Reuch-lin, Guillaume Postel, Cornelius Agrippa, Francesco Patrizi, GiordanoBruno, Ralph Cudworth, and many others.269I have been arguing that thisancient wisdom narrative, grounded in Platonic Orientalism and patristicapologetics, is the conceptual foundation of the initial “referential corpus”of Western esotericism270to which later generations have kept referring tothe present day. However, although all these influential authors believed268The term “clerisy,” introduced by Peter Burke in2000(Social History of Knowledge,18–31), refersto circles of “knowledge specialists” in various periods and societies.269For introductions to all these authors and their work, see the entries devoted to them in Hanegraaff,Dictionary. For a pioneering overview of Platonic Orientalism in the Renaissance, which seems tohave been forgotten by later scholars in the wake of Frances Yates, see Dannenfeldt, “Renaissance.”270This initial referential corpus was grounded in a platonic paradigm and dominated by a highlyerudite Roman Catholic discourse. In its later development, particularly under the influence ofParacelsianism, the corpus was greatly expanded with texts reflective of an alchemical rather thana platonic paradigm, grounded in direct personal experience rather than erudite references to tra-ditional authorities, and hence congenial more to Protestant than to Roman Catholic sensibilities.For this development, see below, pp.192–195."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The universal Catholic: Agostino Steuco69profoundly in a primordial tradition of ancient wisdom, it does not seemto have occurred to any of them to publish a book specifically devoted to it.The credits for having made such an attempt must go to Agostino Steuco(1497/1498–1548), who with hisDe perenni philosophiaof1540publishedthe standard treatment of the subject.271Steuco was a cleric with excellent personal connections to Pope Paul III,andspenthisentirelifeinservicetotheChurch.HewasborninGubbioin1497or1498and entered the Augustinian convent around the age offourteen.

Steuco worked as a prior in Reggio andGubbio from1533on, and in1538received the honorable invitation to takecharge of the Vatican library: “the most prominent scholarly post opento a humanist.”272Somehow he managed to combine this with a parallelappointment as Bishop of Chissamo in Crete. Steuco worked for ten yearsas librarian of the Vatican, and was involved in the Council of Trent from1546until his death two years later.Interestingly, it would seem that, in his youth, Steuco rejected the newplatonic and kabbalistic philosophies: among his early writings that havenot been preserved, there were titles such asLiber contra theologiam platon-icorumandLiber contra cabalistasorContra cabalisticas superstitiones.273Inhis mature work, however, he developed a concept ofphilosophia perennisthat may be characterized as both extreme in its universalismandorthodoxin its relative distance with respect to kabbalistic and magical-symbolicalmethods of interpretation.274This combination might seem somewhatpeculiar at first sight, but is in fact quite logical for a Catholic profes-sional like Steuco in the early decades of the sixteenth century.

In this historical/religious context, Steuco’swork comes to assume the significance of a desperate last attempt, effected bythe means of historical erudition, of reuniting and reconciling the fragmentedChristian world...[It] represents perhaps one of the last attempts to utilize theHumanist ideals in the interest of Catholic Reform, before the latter “will yieldto the disciplinary and dogmatic force of the Counter-Reformation, which willpreserve from Humanism only the splendid but henceforth empty outer form.”278We might conclude, then, that if the Renaissance narrative of ancientwisdom was born at a council of union between East and West, its first lifecycle ended about a century later under the shadow of another council,which sought to restore and impose unity in the face of institutionalfragmentation and doctrinal dissent. From the perspective of conservativeintellectuals like Steuco, the crisis of Christianity could not be overcome bya return to the sources of revelation (the Bible and the apostolic communityaccording to Protestants, theprisca theologiaaccording to the new platonictheology), as though those sources had ever been lost and the Church hadgone astray. On the contrary: the truth had always been available, andalways would be, and the Church had been its legitimate representativesince the birth of Christ.

Seeing these traces,these remnants of wisdom, we believed they had been as it were the rays of a lightgreater in the early ages, and later most great; and thus that all things faced towardsone truth.279Even in a short fragment like this, we encounter a profound macrohistoricalambiguity which is typical of Steuco’s thinking. Have weprogressed“fromless light to more” (from some spiritual elite among the pagans to thereligion of Christ, presumably), or has there been a period of temporaldeclinein between the “greater” light of the ancient wisdom and the “mostgreat” light of Christianity? Steuco does not tell us clearly.280It does notseem to matter to him whether the true religion was passed on from onegeneration to the next in a chain of historical succession, or discoveredindependently by natural reason, or revealed from above. Hence, althoughhe does sketch the broad outlines of a development from Chaldaea andEgypt (with Zoroaster and Hermes as the most ancient sages, but Moses asthe oldestscriptor)281to the Greeks and the Hebrews, his real concern is notwith historical questions of primacy, dependence, influence, or “theft” oflater thinkers from earlier ones.282All that ever matters to him is the basicpoint that the One Truth has always been available for those who searchfor it, although never more perfectly than in the Catholic Church.279Steuco,De perenni philosophia,Bk.i.1.280Schmitt (“Perennial Philosophy,”517–518) rightly emphasizes that Steuco thinks in terms of conti-nuity, but might be overstating his case by denying any notion of progress, which would imply thatnot even Christianity means any advance over the ancient wisdom. Ebert (“Augustinus Steuchus,”355) and Muccillo (Platonismo, Ermetismo e “Prisca Theologia”,18) seem more correct in interpret-ing Steuco as suggesting a natural process of birth, decline and rebirth: philosophy was born inperfect health, then it gradually declined until the decay of old age, but it attained a hithertonever attained height of sublimity after having been reborn in Christianity. On the details of thisdevelopment, see Muccillo,Platonismo,17–22.281Steuco,De perenni philosophiavii.8(Stausberg,Faszination Zarathushtra,vol.i,273; Freudenberger,Augustinus Steuchus,122,203).282That the Chaldaeans (who were closest to the divine wisdom because they lived near the locationof the earthly paradise: Muccillo,Platonismo, Ermetismo e “Prisca Theologia”,23) and the Egyp-tians are presented as more ancient than the Hebrews should certainly not be understood as apolemical position taken against the patristic apologists; rather, Steuco emphasizes their theologyof the universalLogosto such an extreme extent that questions of historical “genealogy” becomelargely irrelevant to him.

If a passage really refuses to fit into his system,he earnestly addresses the author and admonishes him in a fatherly way to cometo his senses.284It follows that Christians will not discover any new truths in the pagansources (and hence need no new exegetical methods, whether kabbalisticor otherwise), but merely confirmation that the divineLogosincarnated asJesus Christ has been active among all peoples from the beginning of time.Once it is understood that whatever is true in pagan doctrine is alreadypresent in Catholicism, but “cleansed of errors and restored to [its] rightfulplace,”285the supreme spiritual authority of the Church can no longer bein any doubt.The solid orthodoxy of this position286makes it much easier to under-stand that (as will be seen in the next chapter) the Protestant anti-apologetic authors who would attack “Platonic-Hermetic Christianity”from the seventeenth century on did not see themselves as targeting some283See Muccillo,Platonismo, Ermetismo e “Prisca Theologia”,20, on Steuco’s understanding of thegospel as the sole and unique foundation for reconstructing, interpreting, and evaluating the ancientwisdom. This further confirms my point in n.282(also emphasized by Muccillo,Platonismo,71)that Steuco is not thinking in historical but in theological terms.284Freudenberger,Augustinus Steuchus,122.285Steuco,De perenni philosophia,Bk.i.2. It would be a mistake to think that for Steuco “everyone isright”: Lutheranism he saw as a “plague” that undermined all true religion (Muccillo,Platonismo,Ermetismo e “Prisca Theologia”,15n.26). It is plausible to see in his attitude an echo of thelate antique and patristic abhorrence of novelty and innovation: from a Tridentine perspective,the Protestants were “dangerous innovators” who broke with Tradition (Delumeau,Catholicismbetween Luther and Voltaire,9), quite similar to how the Christians had been perceived by criticslike Celsus or Porphyry.286De perenni philosophiawas dedicated to Paul III, reprinted three times during the sixteenth century,and never placed on the Index (Schmitt, “Perennial Philosophy,”516,525; Freudenberger,AugustinusSteuchus,123).

While Steuco sought to reveal RomanCatholic doctrine as the hidden core of paganism,287they reversed theargument entirely, and sought to expose paganism as the hidden core ofRoman Catholicism. From such a perspective, the new platonic and kab-balistic philosophies in the wake of Ficino and Pico were merely an extrememanifestation of the pagan potential that had been slumbering in Catholi-cism generally, ever since the times of Justin Martyr and the later patristicapologists.the end of a cycleBefore moving on to the anti-apologetic reaction, it is important to pro-vide a brief evaluation of what the preceding discussion contributes to theleading problematics of this book as a whole. I have been arguing thatthe ancient wisdom narrative of the Renaissance, grounded in PlatonicOrientalism and patristic apologetics, created the conceptual foundationof the initial “referential corpus” of Western esotericism. This means thatWestern esotericism is ultimately grounded in ahistoriographicalconcept,rather than in a common philosophical or religious worldview, a specificapproach to knowledge, or a “form of thought.” However, because theRenaissance narrative of ancient wisdom was itself derived from PlatonicOrientalism, the philosophical worldviews and salvational epistemologiesbasic to that late antique phenomenon certainly became central to it. Thisis why concepts of correspondences, living nature, imagination/mediations(all typical of the late antique philosophies that flourished in the PlatonicOrientalist context) and perhaps even transmutation (linked more specif-ically to the somewhat later development of an “alchemical” paradigm,seeChapter3) are indeed pervasive throughout the corpus, as has beenfamously emphasized by Antoine Faivre.288For the same reason, conceptsof “higher knowledge” or gnosis, whose centrality to the late antique cur-rents in question is well known, were likewise bound to become highlyimportant within the Renaissance narrative of ancient wisdom and its laterdevelopments. And finally, we have seen that the closely related concernwith secrecy and concealment has strong roots in the Platonic Orientalist287As clearly shown by the very structure ofDe perenni philosophia, which is ordered not chronolog-ically but doctrinally: the first six books are about theology (Bks.1–2on the Trinity; Bks.3–6onthe Unity of God), Bk.7is about the created world, Bk.8on the spiritual world (angels, demons),Bk.9on theological anthropology, and Bk.10on ethics and eschatology.288See discussion inChapter4,pp.334–355, esp.353–355."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"74The history of truthmatrix as well, but was given a new degree of prominence due to Pico’sintroduction of kabbalah and its novel exegetical techniques.That the initial referential corpus of Western esotericism was groundedin a historiographical concept of “ancient wisdom” has far-reaching impli-cations, as will be seen throughout the rest of this book. As I emphasizedat the very beginning of this chapter, the discourse developed at a timewhen historical consciousness as we understand it was still in its infancy,and the enthusiasts of ancient wisdom were arguing on the basis not ofcritical historiography, but of unquestionable theological and metaphysicalassumptions. As a result, what emerged from their studies of ancient wis-dom was not a history of human opinions and their development throughtime, but ahistory of truth.289As pointed out at the beginning of this chapter,such a project is by its very nature ambiguous and, indeed, self-defeating. Itis easy to conceive of a “history of error” describing the many ways in whichhuman beings have lapsed from true religion into a variety of erroneousdoctrines and heresies; but by definition, and in sharp contrast, absolutemetaphysical or divine truth cannot possibly change and develop throughtime while still remaining absolute. In other words: the ancient wisdomnarrative of the Renaissance was grounded in what must now be seen as aninherently a-historical approach to historical questions. In the period of theRenaissance this was not a conscious choice – it is only with hindsight thatwe now see the Italian humanists as early pioneers of the history of humanthought; but we will see that since the eighteenth century, it made thenarrative of ancient wisdom highly attractive for authors with deliberateanti-historical agendas, including not a few influential academics.We have concentrated on how the discourse of ancient wisdom devel-oped during roughly a century, between the Councils of Ferrara/Florenceand of Trent. It was during the later sixteenth century and into the seven-teenth, with the development of critical philological methods, that thetruth of history began to catch up, slowly but surely, with the history oftruth. The story of how this happened has often been told, most famouslyby Frances A. Yates in herGiordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition,which emphasizes very strongly how the entire edifice of “the HermeticTradition” had rested upon the erroneous dating of ancient texts and there-fore had to collapse as a result of source criticism.290Yates believed that289Cf. Celenza, “Revival of Platonic Philosophy,”72,74.290Yates,Giordano Bruno, esp. chapter21. The point had already been made by Wind,PaganMysteries,22; and an important later discussion is Grafton, “Protestant versus Prophet.” By far themost complete discussion of all aspects of the “dating of Hermes Trismegistus,” including editionsand facsimiles of all the major primary sources, is Mulsow,Ende des Hermetismus."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The end of a cycle75it was Isaac Casaubon who exploded the myth of Hermes Trismegistus bydemonstrating, in1614, that theCorpus Hermeticumhad not been writtenin very ancient times but as recently as the first centuries of the Christianera. Today we know that Casaubon’s work was, rather, the culminationof a process of historical criticism that had begun already in the1560s.291Eventually, critical philology proved lethal to the intellectual legitimacy notonly of “the Hermetic Tradition,” but of all varieties of the ancient wisdomnarrative: not only the hermetic writings were robbed of their ancient ori-gins and turned out to be from the first centuriesce,butsoweretheChal-daean Oracles292and theOrphic Hymns.293Furthermore, as the history ofphilosophy developed into a critical discipline, scholars began to differenti-ate between Plato’s own philosophical ideas and those developed by the var-ious later, middle- and neoplatonic currents, including the idea of an “eso-teric Plato” whose doctrines were derived from ancient oriental sources.294Frances Yates was right in emphasizing that philological criticismdestroyed the very foundation of the ancient wisdom narrative and ren-dered it intellectually untenable. However, historians of religion know that,no matter how definitive and irrefutable such scholarly arguments may be,they are seldom sufficient to destroy religious conviction. As remarked bythe anthropologist of religion Evans-Pritchard, and confirmed by countlessexamples world-wide,outside empirical or scientific behavior, people aim at ensuring that their notionsand conduct shall be in accord with sentiments and values, and they do not worrywhether their premises are scientifically valid or their inferences entirely logical;and these sentiments and values form a system of thought with a logic of its own.295For the argument developed in this book, this has two consequences. One isthat we should not be surprised by the fact that the ancient wisdom narrativesurvived the era of Casaubon and remains alive and well even up to the291The main early critics were Gilbert Genebrard, Matthieu Beroalde, Johannes van der Gorp,Teodoro Angelucci, and Antonio Persio.

We will turn to this in the next chapter.296See, for example, Hanegraaff,New Age Religion,302–330; Hammer,Claiming Knowledge,85–200.Among an endless series of relevant titles, particularly influential has been Schur ́e,Grands initi ́es.Characteristic for its background in nineteenth-century theosophy, it expands the traditionalWestern genealogy of wisdom so as to move its earliest origins from Egypt to India, resultingin a lineage of Rama, Krishna, Hermes, Moses, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, Jesus. In modernand contemporary versions of the ancient wisdom narrative, the source is frequently moved evenfurther back, to mythical lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, or Mu (Sprague de Camp,LostContinents; Ramaswamy,Lost Land of Lemuria). As an extreme consequence of the same logic,a large branch of contemporary esoteric literature assumes that the ancient cultures had derivedtheir wisdom from other planets, notably Sirius or the Pleiades (see, for example, Colavito,Cultof Alien Gods).297For the important case of Ralph Cudworth’s criticism of Casaubon, see Assmann, “‘Hen kai pan’”;Hofmeier, “Cudworth versus Casaubon.”298If we replace “sentiments and values” by the equivalent formulation “moods and motivations,”there is an interesting parallel in Clifford Geertz’s discussion of how a given religion’s symbolicsystem formulates conceptions of a general order of existence and clothes these “with such an aura offactuality” that the moods and motivations in question “seem uniquely realistic” (Geertz, “Religionas a Cultural System,”4andpassim).Pacethe oft-quoted critique of Talil Asad (“Construction ofReligion”), which makes some valid points but exaggerates their relevance while distorting Geertz’sperspective, and with due attention to the function of ritual, a Geertzian analysis remains extremelyfruitful for understanding the specificity of religious as opposed to rational or scientific modes ofthinking (Hanegraaff, “Defining Religion in Spite of History”; Schilbrack, “Religion, Models of,and Reality”)."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"chapter 2The history of errorExorcizing paganismExorciser, c’est produire pour maudire.Jean Baudrillard1The development of the ancient wisdom narrative during the Renaissancewas possible only because platonism had been an integral part of Christiantheology since the first centuries. As we have seen, when the completedialogues of Plato and a range of ancient texts attributed to his supposedpredecessors – notably Zoroaster, Hermes, and Orpheus – became availablein new Latin translations, the Florentine humanists and those who sharedtheir enthusiasm could appeal to a range of Fathers of the Church insupport of their claim that these pagan writers had been inspired prophets ofChristian truth. The intellectual plausibility of that argument in a RomanCatholic environment explains why, in spite of its increasing associationwith such problematic dimensions as magic and Jewish kabbalah, thephilosophia perenniscould be presented as thoroughly orthodox even by aVatican cleric like Agostino Steuco in the years before the Council of Trent.But the climate was changing. A complicated series of historical devel-opments, each with its own causes and internal dynamics, had begun towork against the vision of the Florentine humanists and, indeed, againstthe very notion of a platonic Christianity compatible with pagan wisdom.As formulated by Frances Yates,as the century moved on into darker years, the orthodox opposition to Renais-sance occult philosophy hardened . . . The hopes for unity had not materialised;Reformation and Catholic reaction had increased disunity.

But political suppression of heretics wasonly one factor, although an important one; at least as significant was thefact that, particularly during the seventeenth century, the ancient wisdomnarrative and its attendant disciplines began to lose intellectual credibilityas their underlying assumptions were challenged by new discoveries andtheoretical perspectives in the realms of philology, philosophy, and naturalscience. Each one of these dimensions is of great importance for the studyof Western esotericism, or for understanding the complicated “process ofdestruction” by means of which the great Western tradition of Christianplatonism gave way, between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries,to worldviews that we recognize as “modern.”3We will return to them,but in this chapter I will concentrate on another dimension: that of thehistoriography of ideas and of theological doctrine. The overall argumentof this chapter is, in a nutshell, that the field of research nowadays referredto as “Western esotericism” first began to be perceived and conceptualizedas a domain in its own right by the so-called “anti-apologetic” authors ofthe later seventeenth century. This happened, however, as the outcome ofa long tradition of anti-platonic4and, more generally, anti-pagan polemicswhich had been provoked by the platonic revival of Florentine humanismand its heirs.against the pagansFrom the very moment that Platonic Orientalism made its first entranceon the stage of Italian humanism, it was accompanied by its anti-platonicshadow. We have seen how the aristotelian George of Trebizond5metGemistos Plethon during the Council in Florence, and hated him everafter as a “poisonous viper” out to destroy Christianity and replace it withHellenistic paganism. One of the major humanists of quattrocento Italy,George was also a paranoid fanatic who believed in a conspiracy of platon-ists preparing the coming of the Antichrist. HisComparatio philosophorum3Mulsow,Moderne aus dem Untergrund,261; Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,1,15,27.4As pointed out by Hankins (“Antiplatonism,”36–37), criticisms of Plato in the Renaissance can bereduced to three heads: his teachings were seen as unsystematic and therefore pedagogically useless,as morally deficient, and as inconsistent with Christian truth. The second and particularly the thirdelements are most important here.5See Monfasani,George of Trebizond; Monfasani,Collectanea Trapezuntiana; Monfasani, “A Tale ofTwo Books”; Hankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,vol.i,165–192,236–245; Matton, “Quelquesfigures de l’antiplatonisme,”369–387."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Against the pagans79Platonis et Aristotelis, finished in1458,6has been described as “one of themost remarkable mixtures of learning and lunacy ever penned.”7Not onlyis Plato attacked there as a pitifully poor philosopher, but he is also accusedof every possible error, sin, or weakness (including sexual depravity, drunk-enness, idolatry, sorcery, and demon-worship) and described as the veryfountainhead of all heresies.8To make matters even worse, not only hadPlato exerted a pernicious influence on Christianity by means of his writ-ings, but in George’s apocalyptic imagination he had given birth to a wholeseries of successors who continued his work. Muhammad was the secondPlato, Plethon the third, and George’sComparatioculminated in dire warn-ings against Cardinal Bessarion, the fourth Plato, who wanted to becomepope and might very well succeed. For proper perspective, one shouldrealize that George of Trebizond and Bessarion were both Greek convertsto Roman Catholicism; but Bessarion was a former pupil of Plethon whoremained faithful to his teacher, and came to the Council as a strong pro-ponent of union. Because George saw Greek Christianity as platonic, andRoman Catholicism as aristotelian, the idea of the “fourth Plato” on thethrone of St. Peter evoked the specter of a Greek/platonist takeover of theChurch of Christ. Even though Trebizond’sComparatiocirculated onlyin manuscript, Bessarion responded with his importantIn calumniatoremPlatonis, first written in Greek, then translated into Latin, and printedin1469. Deeply influenced by Plethon’s perspective, it defended Plato’sthought and argued for its profound compatibility both with Christian-ity and with Aristotle. It is considered the most important synthesis ofRenaissance platonism prior to Ficino’s. With this remarkable couple ofCatholic converts (one born in Trebizond and the other from a familythat came from there) the battle lines were drawn in the sharpest possiblemanner.Among the sympathetic early readers of George of Trebizond’sCom-paratiowere the famous Florentine prophet Savonarola and his fol-lower Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola, Giovanni’s nephew. With thetwo Picos we encounter another striking couple of close antagonists: ifGiovanni was undoubtedly one of the most central authors of the ancientwisdom narrative, Gianfrancesco’sExamen vanitatis doctrinae gentium6PublishedinVenicein1523and available in eleven manuscripts (see Monfasani,Collectanea Trapezun-tiana,600–602; and see discussion of their limited circulation in Monfasani, “A Tale of Two Books,”3–4).7Hankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,vol.i,236.8For good summaries of theComparatio,seeHankins,Plato in the Italian Renaissance,237–241;andespecially Matton, “Quelques figures,”370–386."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"80The history of error(1520) was essentially an attempt “to destroy what his uncle had built.”9Thisfact is remarkable and confusing, particularly because the relation betweenGiovanni and Gianfrancesco (who differed only six years in age) appearsto have been close and affectionate, and Gianfrancesco always wrote abouthis uncle with great respect and admiration. Ultimately, however, nobodywas more important to him than Savonarola, who decisively influenced hisworldview and whom he kept defending even after his excommunicationin1497and his public execution the following year. Giovanni Pico haddied four years earlier, in1494, to the great distress of his nephew, andfor unclear reasons his unpublished manuscripts had fallen into the handsof Savonarola and his Dominican friars at San Marco in Florence. HereGianfrancesco had unlimited access to them, and in1496he published alaudatory biography of his uncle and two volumes of his collected writings:a large although incomplete selection, which has remained the foundationof all later versions of Pico’sOpera Omnia.In spite of these great efforts on behalf of Giovanni Pico’s legacy, every-thing that Gianfrancesco published under his own name goes straightagainst the “pagan learning” that was so essential to his uncle’s program.10This bizarre combination cries out for explanation. From a provocativediscussion by Steven Farmer,11there emerges a sinister scenario accordingto which Giovanni Pico’s legacy may deliberately have been doctored andmanipulated by his nephew, under the immediate influence of Savonarolaand his circle at the San Marco. Farmer argues that Gianfrancesco (incollaboration with his personal physician Giovanni Mainardi, an ardentSavonarolan) tampered with his uncle’s legacy to an extreme degree,9Schmitt, “Gianfrancesco Pico’s Attitude,”312.Pico’sExamenwas written between1502and1514,and published at Mirandola in1520; it is available in Pico,Opera Omnia,vol.ii,710–1264.

If Farmer is right – his argument is persuasive, but he is carefulin pointing out the difficulties that still stand in the way of a definitiveconclusion – we could be dealing with a shocking case of historical falsifi-cation, which had the result of greatly exaggerating Savonarola’s impact onthe later Giovanni Pico. The strongly worded rejections ofprisca theologiathat are found in his unfinishedDisputationesagainst astrology would seemto suggest that in the last years of his life, he came to renounce his paganerrors and was “converted” to evangelical Christianity under Savonarola’sinfluence: a picture wholly in Gianfrancesco’s interests, as it allowed him tohighlight Savonarola’s beneficial influence while at the same time preserv-ing his uncle’s posthumous reputation. But the manuscript is no longeravailable, and those attacks on theprisci theologimay also be interpola-tions by Gianfrancesco,12in which case we could be dealing with a blatantattempt at “depaganizing” Giovanni Pico in the interest of posthumouslyturning him, as strongly as possible, into a Christian evangelical convert.Be that as it may, the correct Christian perspective on paganism as Gian-francesco saw it is presented most clearly in hisExamen vanitatis:aworkthat deserves special attention here as the earliest example of an “anti-pagan” reaction in the Renaissance historiography of thought, and as thefirst in a line of publications preparing the way for the anti-apologists of theseventeenth century. Pico’s work has mostly been discussed as an exampleof philosophical skepticism: taking his cue from Sextus Empiricus, he setsout to demonstrate the vanity and uncertainty of all philosophical reason-ing and humanistic learning.13Like Savonarola, Gianfrancesco points tosacred scripture as the sole, exclusive and absolutely infallible source of trueknowledge: the certainty given by absolute faith in the Bible, down to thesmallest iota,14is thereby placed in sharp opposition to the uncertainty ofany conclusions based upon the weak instrument of human reason. Hence12Interestingly, Farmer suggests that modern computer techniques may make it possible to identifyinterpolations on the basis of the stylistic differences between Giovanni’s and Gianfrancesco’s Latin(Syncretism in the West,172).13The actual distance between ancient skepticism and Pico’s perspective has, however, been empha-sized in recent scholarship: see, for example, Farmer,Syncretism in the West,156–157; and esp. Cao,Scepticism and Orthodoxy.14See the opening sentences of Savonarola’s treatise against astrology (Trattato contra li astrologii.1,inSavonarola,Scritti filosofici,vol.i,278): “The foundation of Christian religion is the sacred Scriptureof the New and Old Testament, which we are obliged to believe to be true down to the smallestiota, and we must approve all that it approves, and disapprove of all that it disapproves of, since itis made by God, who cannot err.”"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"82The history of errorthe peculiar combination of skepticism and fideism, very similar to whatwe will find much later in the work of Cornelius Agrippa.15The consid-erable implications for the history of philosophy as a discipline have beenwell formulated by Luciano Malusa:Gianfrancesco Pico held that the aim of the historical study of philosophy was todemonstrate the conditions of human philosophical thinking when deprived ofthe light of revelation, or claiming independence from it. This involved going backto the past in order to discover why the errors were made and why the philosophershad become divided.16In other words, the history of philosophy unaided by divine inspirationcan only be conceived of as a history of error and division. Further on inhis excellent analysis, Malusa emphasizes that for Pico, human philosophywas merely a “humble and totally inadequate preparation” for the studyof scripture, and explains why it was precisely this fact that made it intoa possible object of historical research. Since the biblical truth is absolute,it is beyond modification or historical change, that is to say, it does notdevelop through time – and therefore all one might do is illustrate howtheologians and Church Fathers have been defending this one and uni-versal divine revelation “against the explicit and implicit attacks of paganphilosophers.”17In other words, Pico understood that a “history of truth”is self-contradictory. It follows that the proper domain of historiography,in contrast, must consist in describing the development of merely humanand hence fallible opinions. From the perspective of absolute biblical truth,any proper history of thought is therefore necessarily a history of error. Wewill see that this crucial insight became the very foundation from whichemerged the history of philosophy as a modern discipline.In contrast to George of Trebizond, Pico was somewhat softer on Platothan on Aristotle;18and this is perhaps not surprising, because it madeit easier for him to keep seeing the early Fathers as preservers of biblicalrevelation in spite of their platonic leanings. Nevertheless,prisci theologisuch as Zoroaster, Hermes, or Orpheus had been looking for the truth invain: deprived of revelation, they merely discovered attributes of divinityinstead of penetrating its essence.19In the ancient world, only the Hebrewshad been in possession of divine truth.

As Malusa puts it, in Pico’s vision the study of the “true philosophy” of revealed doctrine“was not ‘research into’ but ‘possession of ’ the truth.”18Schmitt,Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola,62–63.19For example, G.

AfterSocrates, there had been a proliferation of no fewer than nine philosophicalsects, all of them opposed by the skeptics, who rightly argued that noneof them could claim to possess the truth.20All that the philosophershad done was introduce new errors, and create dissent and confusion.In polite but explicit opposition to his uncle’s program of reconciliation,Gianfrancesco therefore states that the teachings of the pagan philosophers“must be demolished” and “invalidated.”21In the last three books of hisExamen vanitatis, Pico concentrated on criticizing Aristotle’s philosophyin particular. After these lengthy polemics, his invitation to simple faithbased upon the study of scripture and the sacred theologians came as anatural conclusion.22It is important to realize that even authors who were generally sym-pathetic to the ancient wisdom might still be cautious about the dangersof magic, paganism, and heresy: as has been clearly pointed out by D. P.Walker, this was particularly true for the reception of theprisca theolo-giain France, with important authors such as Jacques Lef`evre d’Etaples,Symphorien Champier, and a series of others.23Moreover, and as one back-ground reason for their attitude of caution, one should never lose sight ofthe fact that in the wake of the notoriousMalleus Maleficarumof1486(thevery year in which Pico planned his great debate), the great witch crazeof the early modern period developed in perfect parallel with the ancientwisdom discourse. Given that context, it was inevitable that critics wouldbegin to question whether the “learned magic” of the Florentines was asinnocent of demonism as they claimed. TheMalleusitself came too earlyto be influenced by Pico’s magical theses or Ficino’s astral and talismanicmagic in hisDe vita coelitus comparanda(1489), but the impact of theirwork and its reception can be clearly seen in the important witchcrafttreatise by the Dutch physician Johann Weyer (or Wier),De praestigiisdaemonum, written in1561–1562and published a year later.From age fourteen to eighteen, between1530and1534/1535, Weyer was anapprentice to Cornelius Agrippa.24These were the final years of Agrippa’slife, during which he published his two main works,De incertitudineand20Ibid.,i.2(Opera Omnia,vol.ii,735–739).21Ibid.,i.2andiv.2(Opera Omnia,vol.ii,738and1026).22Malusa, “Renaissance Antecedents,”45.23Walker, “Prisca Theologiain France,”204andpassim; cf.

Agrippa emphasized the “uncertainty and vanity” of all humanarts and sciences no less strongly than Gianfrancesco Pico, but did notconclude that this made them false and pernicious: all it implied was thatthey had their limitations and could not claim the absolute truth that isgiven only by faith. God’s revelation in the Bible, Agrippa points out,cannot be grasped by any judgment of our senses, by any reasoning of our mind,by any syllogism delivering proof, by any science, by any speculation, by anycontemplation, in short, by any human powers, but only by faith in Jesus Christ,poured into our soul by God the Father through the intermediary of the HolySpirit...[T]heintellect...mustbesubjectedtofaith,andfaithmustnotgivewayto the intellect, but must firmly place its hope in God. [Therefore] we must notdebate over divine matters, but firmly put our faith in them. On the other hand,we are permitted to philosophize, dispute, and formulate deductions by means ofour intellect concerning all created things, but we are not to place our faith andhope in them.26Weyer knew that Agrippa’s piety was genuine, and later defended his masteragainst accusations of black magic and demon-worship; but he movedmuch closer to the younger Pico’s position in arguing that the magical artswere not only uncertain, but pernicious and dangerous as well. Publishedin the final year of the Council of Trent, hisDe praestigiis daemonumstands at the beginning of a period in which the witch hunt was gainingmomentum on the Continent, while at the same time, as formulated byGeorge Mora, “that natural blending of paganism and Christianity – whichhad sustained the masses of peasants confronted with all sorts of dangers,real or imaginary – was being destroyed by the actions of the renewedChurch.”2725Schmitt, “Who Read Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola?,”116; Pico is referred to explicitly inDepraestigiis daemonumii.3–4, 16; iii.31.26Agrippa,Opera,299and553.

It should be noted that there is a specific dimension of concealment to Agrippa’s statementson “faith”: although he would seem to be defending a kind of biblicism similar to Savonarola’s andGianfrancesco Pico’s, he was actually referring to a hermetic doctrine of gnosis strongly influencedby Lodovico Lazzarelli (Hanegraaff, “Better than Magic”).27Mora, “Introduction,” lvi, and following pages.

The story begins with the fallen angels, their success in bringingabout the fall of Adam and Eve,28and their perverting influence on Noah’sson Ham after the Flood. Thus begins a historical lineage of darkness,for Ham’s son Misraim, who turns out to be identical with Zoroaster,29“first discovered the blasphemous and notorious impiety of Magic.”30Theresults were disastrous: even while Noah was still alive, he had to watchhelplessly how out of his own bloodline, “dreadful forms of idolatry burstupon the Church of God.”31The Egyptians, Babylonians and Persians areall descended from Zoroaster,32and transmitted the arts of idolatrous magicon to other peoples, so that finally the whole world came to be filled “withthe fumes of impiety as though from a furnace or factory of wickedness.”33Weyer continues by explaining how magic spread from the most ancientcultures to the Greeks, not least because eminent philosophers such asPythagoras, Democritus and Plato picked it up during their travels:Upon their return, they extolled the art and preserved it among their secret teach-ings. In fact, we know that Pythagoras and Plato approached the seers of Egyptian-Memphis in order to get a knowledge of magic and travelled through almost allof Syria, Egypt, Judea, and the schools of the Chaldaeans...the Assyrians, thePersians, the Arabs, the Ethiopians, and the Indians . . .34In this narrative, “magic” means idolatry: it consists of invocation andworship of the pagan gods, who are really demons. However, Weyer hadnot entirely forgotten Agrippa’s insistence on differentiating between thesublime religion known asmageiaamong the ancients, and the sacrilegiouspractices that had come to be confused with it.35He grudgingly admitsthat there must be such a thing as acceptable natural magic, not leastbecause of the gospel account of theMagifrom the East who followed astar; but in practice, almost invariably one finds it to be hopelessly mixedup and confused with “impious superstition,” the “allurements of sorceryand theurgy,” and the “impostures of demons.”36Likewise, the Jewish28We ye r,De praestigiis daemonumi.1–3(Mora ed.,3–11).29Ibid.ii.3(Mora ed.,100).30Ibid.i.4(Mora ed.,11).31Ibid.32Ibid.i.4andii.3(Mora ed.,11,100).33Ibid.ii.3(Mora ed.,100–106) for the details of transmission to various peoples.34Ibid.ii.3(Mora ed.,103).35Agrippa,Occulta Philosophia, Dedicatory letter to Trithemius (Perrone Compagni ed.,68;seeChapter1,n.265).36We ye r,De praestigiis daemonumii.3(Mora ed.,103–104)."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"86The history of errorkabbalah may originally have been just “the more secret interpretation ofdivine law,” but it has come to be “defiled and corrupted by magic.”37Inany case, the idolatrous practices of magic were continued by platonists likePorphyry, Plotinus, and Proclus; and they became thefons et origoof theChristian heresies, beginning with Simon Magus: “From Simon, as thoughfrom a seed pod, there sprouted forth in long succession the monstrousOphites,theshamelessGnostics...theimpiousValentinians,Cardonians,Marcionists, Montanists, and many other heretics.”38Borrowing directlyfrom Gianfrancesco Pico’sDe rerum praenotione, Weyer continues thelineage up to the present, with special mention of Julian the Apostate,Roger Bacon, Peter of Abano, Albertus Magnus, Arnaud of Vilanova,Picatrix(which he believes to be the name of an author), and Ceccod’Ascoli. Many of them suffered a terrible death, for after the demons haveused human beings, they destroy them.Interestingly, and probably due to the formative influence of Agrippa,Weyer’s genealogy of demonic magic is continued into the high MiddleAges but does not include the Florentine platonists or their sympathizers.39Moreover, Plato is not given a place of any special prominence. Neverthe-less, Weyer’s genealogy of demon-worship is a perfect example of PlatonicOrientalism turned negative. A lineage is drawn that begins with Zoroasterand the ancient cultures of the Orient, moves on westward to the Greeks,and is adopted from there by the neoplatonists; but far from being a tra-dition of venerable ancient wisdom, it is a demonic genealogy of darkness.It is this simple fact that makes it possible for Weyer not to finish with theplatonists who influenced the Fathers, but tocontinuehis story with thegnostic heresies of the first centuries. From this time on, this connectionwould become increasingly common.In major anti-witchcraft tracts after Weyer we usually find some refer-ences to the origins and subsequent history of magic, but these tend tobe sketchy and derivative. The implied historical narrative largely remainssimilar to Weyer’s, with a satanically inspired Zoroaster at the origin andthe platonists as primary culprits,40but the Florentine humanists and their37Ibid.ii.3(Mora ed.,104).38Ibid.ii.3(Mora ed.,106).39Having discussed Weyer’s somewhat remarkable inclusion of Albertus Magnus, who is condemnedas “a superstitious maker of talismans,” D. P. Walker claims that “It is as a follower of Albert thatWier casually condemns Ficino, ‘otherwise a most learn`ed philosopher’ ” (Spiritual and DemonicMagic,153). On the contrary, I would suggest that since Weyer was certainly aware of Ficino’sdiscussions of talismans inDe vita coelitus comparanda, it is remarkable that he does not condemnhim, but lets him off the hook so easily.40See for instance De Lancre,Tableauvi.2.1(Inconstancy,417–419), who sees all the great philosophersof antiquity as sorcerers, and repeats the story of Ham’s son Misraim being identical with Zoroaster."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Against the pagans87sympathizers (Ficino, but more frequently Giovanni Pico and CorneliusAgrippa) now begin to be mentioned as well. Thus Jean Bodin in his chattyand chaoticDe la d ́emonomanie des sorciers(1580)41writes that althoughthe Persian word magic referred simply to philosophy, it was pervertedinto “diabolic sorcery” under the influence of the devil; and “the first whoserved Satan to publish this impiety in Persian” was Zoroaster.42Socratesadmitted himself that he was inspired by a demon,43and among laterexamples of the same lineage are Iamblichus, Proclus, Plotinus, Porphyry,and the emperor Julian. Among contemporaries, Bodin highlights Picoand particularly Agrippa, “the grand doctor of the Diabolical art.”44Much more solid and systematic was the discussion in the Jesuit Martindel Rio’sDisquisitionum magicarum libri sex(1599). Beginning with ques-tions of etymology and definition, he discussed magic as a manifestationof “superstition” in the technical scholastic sense which made it insepa-rable from idolatry.45Del Rio is more respectful than Bodin towards thedistinction between natural and demonic magic, describing the latter asa perversion of the legitimate natural knowledge that God had bestowedalready on Adam. Quite similar to what we saw in Plethon, he writes thatfrom the Persians emerged a good magic concerned with knowledge of theinnermost nature of things, and a bad kind concerned with the worship offalse gods and linked to the heresies of Marcion and Mani.46There wereseveral Zoroasters, one of whom is supposed to have written theChaldaeanOracles, a book he finds more obscure than useful. With this lineage, delRio appears to associate a whole series of platonic authors, many of whom(he mentions Proclus, Psellus, and Plethon) defend an acceptable magicconcerned with the secrets of nature. He ends with a list of authors whoare inspired by the devil or may at least be suspected of heresy to somedegree: they include Peter of Abano, Roger Bacon, Ramon Llull, Arnaud ofVilanova, Geber, the author of thePicatrix, Cecco d’Ascoli, al-Kindi, Cor-nelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, George Ripley, Girolamo Cardano, GiovanniBaptista della Porta, Pietro Pomponazzi, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola47and, surprisingly, Jean Bodin.

But del Rio’s perspective isless paranoid than Bodin’s and Weyer’s, and although his narrative is quitecompatible with a Platonic Orientalist framework understood negatively,there is no particular emphasis on the dramatic notion of a platonic orpre-platonic “genealogy of darkness.” I would suggest that this reflects thepredicament of an erudite Catholic professional in this particular period,who (consciously or not) had to steer some middle course between theassociation of platonism and its pre-platonic origins with diabolic magic,on the one hand, and the fact that Catholic doctrine would seem to beimplicated with very similar origins, on the other. This combination wassomething of an intellectual time bomb, which came to explode in theseventeenth century, as will be seen.If del Rio’s primary concern was with demonic magic, other Catholicsduring the last decade of the sixteenth century were beginning to crackdown on platonism (and Platonic Orientalism) specifically. Although even-tually it would probably have happened anyway, this reaction was provokedspecifically by Francesco Patrizi and hisNova de universis philosophiaof1591.48This grand philosophical synthesis on Platonic Orientalist foun-dations was dedicated to Pope Gregory XIV, and recommended by itsauthor as an instrument for converting the Protestants and the Muslimsby rational, peaceful means. Virulently anti-aristotelian, it was intended asan alternative textbook49for the teaching of philosophy: Patrizi went sofar as to ask the pope to have it put on the curriculum of every school anduniversity in Christendom, to replace the old scholastic manuals that werebased upon what Patrizi denounced as the anti-Christian heresies of Aris-totle. Perhaps surprisingly, the initial reaction was more than encouraging:Patrizi was invited to teach philosophy at the University “La Sapienza” inRome, with strong encouragement by Cardinal Aldobrandini, who him-self became Pope Clement VIII on January30,1592.50It is one of thecruel ironies of history that Giordano Bruno seems to have thought thatthis development might signal a turning of the tide in his favor as well,51whereas of course he was to be executed in Rome under the same pope.48On Patrizi and this work, see Schuhmann, “Francesco Patrizi”; Leijenhorst, “Francesco Patrizi’sHermetic Philosophy”; Puliafito, “Searching for a New Physics”; Puliafito, “Hermetische Texte”;Purnell, “Francesco Patrizi”; Mulsow, “‘Philosophia Italica’”; Brach, “Patrizi.”49Leijenhorst, “Francesco Patrizi’s Hermetic Philosophy,”129–130.50Firpo, “Flowering and Withering,”275–276.51See Leijenhorst, “Francesco Patrizi’s Hermetic Philosophy,”142n.12, with reference to Mercati,Sommario del Processo,56–57."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Against the pagans89That Patrizi’s work was initially received as being in perfect accord withChristian piety by the highest clerical circles of Rome is remarkable, for infact Patrizi goes even farther than Ficino in downplaying the importance ofthe Hebrew patriarchs and prophets in favor of the pagan philosophers.52Strangely enough, his lineage of divine wisdom starts like Weyer’s genealogyof darkness: with Noah’s son Ham, usually considered the originator ofidolatry, superstition, and demonic magic. Patrizi’s genealogies exist inseveral variations, but their main elements are that Ham either is identicalwith Zoroaster or had a son of that name, who was a contemporary ofAbraham and was known in Egypt as Osiris. Zoroaster/Osiris’ counselorthere was Hermes Trismegistus, whose grandson carried the same name,and wrote theCorpus Hermeticumin a period slightlybeforeMoses: aclear departure, surprisingly again, from the patristic perspective. Orpheuslearned the hermetic wisdom when he traveled to Egypt, and took it toGreece, whence it was passed on from Aglaophemus and Pythagoras toPlato and his pupils. The lineage was temporarily interrupted by Aristotle,who had no respect for the ancient wisdom, but was fortunately takenup again by Ammonius Saccas and continued by the other neoplatonists.After another period of decline during the Middle Ages, again caused bythe influence of Aristotle, it was revived again by authors such as RamonLlull, Ficino and his school, but also Paracelsus.The powerful defenders of scholastic theology were bound to experiencePatrizi’sNova de universis philosophiaas a provocation; and with hindsight,it seems clear that this eventually resulted in a considerable increase ofanti-platonic sentiment from the final decade of the sixteenth century on.Already in1592Patrizi was forced to defend himself against accusations ofheresy, and in spite of his willingness to submit to the Church’s authorityand amend the text wherever necessary, his book was finally prohibited in1594. To his terror and deep humiliation, he was severely rebuked for hiserrors, and ordered to collect all copies of his work and hand them overfor destruction.53Nevertheless, in spite of this condemnation, the initialwelcome accorded to Patrizi shows that even by the early1590s the debateover platonism was by no means settled among Counter-Reformation theo-logians, and aphilosophia perennisalong the lines of Agostino Steuco stillhad considerable credibility.

It was presented as the first volume of an even larger projecttitledDe ethnicis philosophis caute legendis,55which was never completedbut would have covered virtually all other pagan thinkers connected withthephilosophia perennis. Arriving in Rome around the same time as Patrizi,in1591, Crispo’s connections in the high circles of Counter-Reformationintellectuals seem to have been so excellent that he could afford to have hisbook printed without the standard note of ecclesiastical approval, flauntingthe names of an impressive array of high ecclesiastical dignitaries andtheological authorities instead.56Given the general climate of repressionand persecution in Italy at the time, this fact alone must have lent anintimidating quality to what turns out to be a thorough indictment of theplatonic enemy.At the beginning of his book, Crispo printed a catalogue of authorswho should be “read with caution.” They included Zoroaster, HermesTrismegistus and Orpheus, followed by a long series of pre-socratics, Platoand Aristotle, and a large array of what we would describe as middle- andneoplatonic philosophers. The list was continued with the main medievalMuslim philosophers plus a few from the Greek and Latin domain, withPlethon and Leone Ebreo as the most recent names.

Fromthe very moment that the heavenly truth was “sent down to us from heaven”with the birth of Christ, the devil began to fight against it, using the gentilephilosophers (“the patriarchs of the heretics”) as his primary tools. At firstsight it might look as if the battle was lost by the pagans and their perverseteachings, since the Church of Christ was victorious. However, the Fathersmade a fatal mistake: rather than insisting on the exclusive truth of theChristian faith against the absolute evil of pagan religion, they engaged ina practice of “comparative religion.”Thus...itoftenhappened that the Fathers allowed religion to be compared withreligion, that is to say, the sacred one with the profane. And mortal men (whomthey made into gods) were allowed to be compared with the immortal God, angelsand holy men with their demons, household gods, and even ghosts, genii and whatmore impure there is.Having once entered the “unworthy arena of comparison” (indignam com-parationis arenam) the Fathers ended up attributing anything genuinelypious or religious to the gods of Greece; and from there, “not daring torefuse to the Egyptians what they allowed the Prophets,” they were led tosee it as having originated in Egypt. The tragedy, according to Crispo, isthat in this manner, the war against paganism became “domestic and hid-den” (domesticum, atque occultum): even though the “external” battle withthe other religions might have been won, the Church now had to fight theenemy within. Having been victorious in their battle against the pagans,57According to his contemporary biographer de Angelis, Crispo left manuscripts of the second andthird parts, entitledDe ethnicis philosophis, various “Dissertazioni, Discorsi, e Poesi varie” and, veryinterestingly, a work calledAnimadversiones in animarium Platonicum Marsilii Ficini(de Angelis,“Vita di Gio.

Among these “captives of the enemy who were spared”was Plato:Humanely received by our people, and more kindly than was fitting – for hewas a pagan and the most famous standard-bearer of the enemy, fully drenchedin vain superstitions, not just of the Greeks but also of foreign peoples – by thesharpness of his mind, his knowledge of the teachings of various peoples, and hisfamous voyage to Egypt, he made the powers of his mind (which had alreadybeen more than excellent) so strong, and so much strengthened his teachingwith his inborn eloquence, that whether he discoursed about God and his oneor I do not know what trinity, his goodness, his providence, the creation of theworld, the celestial minds, demons, or the soul, or finally morals, he was the onlyone among the Greeks who seemed to have reached the final summit of Greekwisdom.From here came our first fall into evil. From here, heretics have dared to spreadtheir ambiguous voices among the people. From here all kinds of superstitions,lies and depravities could form an array and begin to infect the Church of God.From here on the heretics have waged a horrific and nefarious war, saturated withall hatred and wickedness, against the walls, the roof, and the holy doorposts ofthe Church.So great was Plato’s wisdom, and so sweet his eloquence, that he largelysucceeded in overcoming his victors: the writings of Clement, Origen,Justin Martyr, Eusebius, Theodoretus, and Augustine all demonstrate howstrongly the Fathers of the Church were seduced by the ability of “theprisoner Plato” to “insinuate his very self into the souls of many.” Whichbrings Crispo to his conclusion, printed in capitals, about Plato, “whomwe should better correct with care, or (as I now hope todo)read with sufficient caution, rather than keep as a prisonerof war.” Through contact with Plato, many people became “deserters anddefectors” from the army of Christ. As examples, Crispo mentions variousgnostic heresies and platonic philosophies, but he clearly sees Plato asthe very source of heresy as such: not only does he mention Arianismand Donatism, but he even lists “the Luthers, Calvins, Melanchthonsof our almost fallen age, and six hundred others like them.” Everythingshameful in their writings and actions can ultimately be traced back tothe philosophers in general, and Plato in particular.

For them, Plato’sdoctrines were immoral and incompatible with Christian truth; and if hewas perceived as standing in a long tradition of oriental “wisdom,” this60The organization ofDe Platone caute legendois based upon a complex tree diagram (printed rightbefore the beginning of the numbered pages) that begins by discussing ideas of the soul before,during, and after embodiment, and continues by splitting up each of these categories into furtherones, which are again split up, and so on. Each chapter is devoted to a category, and begins witha short summary of biblical passages that should be read with caution (because if interpretedincorrectly, they might give rise to heretical ideas about the soul), followed by a listing of the mostrelevant patristic, dogmatic and theological authorities, as well as the specific heresies connected tothe opinion in question.

Clearlythe defense of “ancient wisdom” amounted to nothing less than a demonicattempt at undermining and perverting Christianity by reintroducing thegods of the pagans along with the errors of the Jews.But critics who investigated the Florentine agenda more closely werebound to discover a disconcerting truth: to a surprising extent, thosepaganizing heretics seemed to have the Fathers of the Church on their side!The so-called “Platonism of the Fathers” (more precisely, as I have argued,the “Platonic Orientalism of the Fathers”) was a problem that had beenslumbering in Christian theology from its very beginning, almost like akind of latent disease; but it had now become acute because the newlyavailable sources made direct and precise comparisons between the paganphilosophers and the patristic apologists unavoidable.

P`eresin1711(see Glawe,Hellenisierung,138–144)andtheauthor of the anonymousHistoire critique de l’ ́eclecticismepublished in1766(ibid.,254–358). Moresophisticated versions survive even in modern scholarship. For example, Charles Partee (Calvinand Classical Philosophy,115n.55) approvingly quotes Etienne Gilson’s statement that “For theFathers of the Church, neither the truth of the faith, nor the dogma defining it, depended inany way on philosophy” and “The formula ‘The Platonism of the Fathers’ would lead to anabsurd interpretation if it were meant to say that the Fathers were Platonists” (History of ChristianPhilosophy,93). On the contrary, as suggested in the previous chapter, such neat distinctions betweenphilosophy and theology are a modern projection, here used for covert apologetic ends: to keepthe Fathers conveniently “clean” of platonic contamination. The same bias is present to a stunningdegree even in relatively recent discussions of the “Platonism of the Fathers” by highly qualifiedscholars such as Meijering (“Zehn Jahre Forschung”) and particularly D ̈orrie (“Was ist ‘sp ̈atantikerPlatonismus’?”)."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Against the Fathers95that pagan philosophy could be harmonized with the biblical message atleast up to a point, and thereby had to end up endorsing some version ofthe ancient wisdom narrative. If, on the other hand, any such acceptance ofpagan thought was considered taboo, one was forced to conclude that theFathers had been fallible, or even wrong, and the dogmatic system of theChurch had been contaminated with error since the first centuries. It thenbecame necessary to investigate how much of it might still be salvaged,and by which criteria. It is not hard to see that this second possibility car-ried an enormous polemical potential from Protestant perspectives, sinceit strongly suggested that Roman Catholicism and its dogmatic traditionas a whole might be exposed as a pagan perversion.The controversy over the Platonism of the Fathers – often referredto by the famous but problematic catch-phrase of a “Hellenization ofChristianity” – is of great complexity, and has played a crucial role intheological and philosophical controversies from the sixteenth throughthe nineteenth century, focused in particular on Trinitarian theology.63Strange though it may seem to us, used as we are to thinking of rationalphilosophy and science as primary agents of “progress,” these debates mustbe counted among the most important factors in the historical processleading towards “modernization.” As pointed out by Martin Mulsow, theanti-platonic critique resulted in the gradual but inexorable “destruction”of a great intellectual tradition that had been integral to Christian culturebefore the Reformation.64The overall effect of the controversy was thatof creating a sharp opposition between two logical alternatives: one either63The standard treatment remains Glawe,Hellenisierung, and cf. the excellent short discussion of the“Hellenization theorem” in Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,7–20(recent studies of the reception ofthe Fathers during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are amazingly silent about the debateconcerning their “platonizing” tendencies: see, for example, Quantin,Catholicisme classique;Backus,Reception of the Church Fathers,vol.ii). The term “Hellenization of Christianity” (famous, of course,from its earlier usage by Adolf von Harnack) is extremely problematic, as it reflects the normativetheological idea of an originally “pure” apostolic Christianity infected or contaminated “fromoutside” by Hellenistic paganism, as emphasized by Glawe himself: “The typical characteristicof the concept of the hellenization of Christianity [is its] pernicious influence [ihre verderblicheEinwirkung] on the simplicity of the apostolic teaching upon which the Church’s credo is based”(Hellenisierung,4–5;andcf.hisclosingremarksonp.322, according to which the Hellenistic “form”of Christian dogma can be kept separate from its “content,” so that “in their innermost essence,the objective truths of the religion of salvation and those of hellenism were so disharmonious,heterogeneous and without any mutual affinity that a syncretism of their highest values as apermanent product had to be excluded from the outset”). In a famous essay, Jonathan Z. Smithhas demonstrated how precisely this non-historical bias, based upon the Protestant anti-Catholicpolemics of the early modern period, has survived as a hidden assumption basic to the mainstreamof New Testament scholarship and study of ancient religions (Smith,Drudgery Divine, esp.33–34,42–46).64Mulsow,Moderne aus dem Untergrund,261."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96The history of erroradhered to a narrative of ancient wisdom based upon a synthesis of somekind between Christianity and pagan wisdom, or one separated the truebiblical and apostolic message sharply from the error of paganism in all itsforms.These two alternatives cannot be neatly distinguished along confessionaldemarcation lines, as will be seen, but there is no doubt that Protestants wereoverwhelmingly dominant in the anti-platonic camp. For our concerns inthis chapter, it is of crucial importance to understand that precisely theircriticism of patristic platonism is inseparable from the emergence of a newkind of historical consciousness. The basic point was well formulated byFerdinand Christian Baur already by the mid-nineteenth century:If for the Catholic there is no such thing as a historical movement through whichthe Church has become essentially different from what it was at its origin, if inthe entire development of the Church he merely sees its immanent truth comingto ever greater realization and ever more general recognition, from the perspectiveof the Protestant, in contrast, the Church as it exists in the immediate present isseparated from what it originally was by an abyss that is so wide, that betweenthese two points in time there must have been an immeasurable series of changes.65In other words, in sharp contrast to the unbroken continuity of truth pro-claimed by Catholic historians from Agostino Steuco to Cesarius Baronius(see below), the Protestant perspective was based upon the conviction thatthe Church had badly gone astray between the apostolic period and thepresent time. Precisely how and why the Church had degenerated from itsoriginal purity could only be discovered by critical study of the historicalsources. As pointed out by Mark Pattison in his monograph about IsaacCasaubon, and highlighted by Jonathan Z. Smith,66it is important here tosee that the emphasis on scripture was not itself the “moving spring” of theReformation but, rather, a response to the ever more urgent sense of “decayand degeneracy”: just as man had fallen and needed to be restored by divinegrace, likewise the Church itself had fallen into corruption in the courseof its historical development, and needed to be cured of its affliction. Thedisease was identified as platonism – shorthand for paganism – and thediagnostic method was that of historical criticism.The essential logic of this development, but still without the focus onPlato, can be clearly observed already in the great Protestant church history65Baur,Epochen der kirchlichen Geschichtsschreibung,40. In the context of Baur’s discussion, the twoalternatives are represented in exemplary fashion by Baronius’Annaleson the one hand, and the“Magdeburg Centuries” on the other (see text).66Pattison,Isaac Casaubon,322;Smith,Drudgery Divine,13.

The overall narrativewas based upon an extreme dualism that opposed the pristine purity ofthe original gospel to the heaps of superstitions adopted by the RomanChurch from the pagans and the Jews.68The resulting picture was oneof ever-increasing darkening and degradation, as elegantly formulated byPattison:In this protestant delineation, the church starts in the apostolic age in perfectpurity, and is perverted by a process of slow canker, till it has become changed intoits opposite, and is now the church not of Christ, but of anti-Christ, an instrumentnot for saving men but for destroying them.69Thus the Centuriators describe how, since the first centuries, the truedoctrine preached by Christ and the apostles (which, not surprisingly,turns out to be identical with the Lutheran doctrine)70had been strugglingfor survival against the satanic counter-church of Rome and its worldlypower, represented by the papacy. Most relevant for our concerns is howambivalent the “Magdeburg Centuries” nevertheless remained about therole of the early Fathers of the Church. Although these Fathers couldnot possibly be interpreted as adhering to Lutheran doctrine, they stilllived close to the apostolic period and well before Constantine, and theCenturiators did not dare go so far as to classify them among the heretics:instead, they merely reproached early patristic doctrine for having some“weak spots” or blemishes (naevi).71From this we may conclude two things.First, if even an anti-Catholic polemicist as extreme as Flacius Illyricus stillhesitated to attack the ante-Nicene Fathers, this says something about howdaring it was for a Counter-Reformation ideologist like Crispo to criticizethem only a few decades later. And second, it shows that by the1560sand1570s, even the strongest enemies of Roman Catholicism had not yetdiscovered the real potential of anti-platonism as a weapon against it.67Flacius,Ecclesiastica historia.

Casaubon’s dat-ing of theCorpus Hermeticum, in reaction to Baronius’ listing of Her-mes Trismegistus as a gentile prophet, has received much attention inthe wake of Frances Yates, and rightly so;72but for our discussion itis important to emphasize his treatment of the Fathers. Baronius’ work(criticism of which had been officially prohibited by the Church!)73wasutterly typical of the standard Catholic approach: hisAnnales“exhibitedthe visible unity and impeccable purity of the church founded upon Peter,and handed down inviolate, such at this day as it had ever been.”74Inother words, in spite of an incredibly impressive documentation (the fullresources of the Vatican library and other Italian libraries were put at hisdisposal), Baronius’ approach was wholly lacking in any sense of historicalcriticism, and merely compiled heaps of data without seeking to differ-entiate pious legend from plausible fact.75In sharp contrast, Casaubonasked hard questions of a historical nature, about how Hellenistic culturecould have influenced early Christianity, emphasizing in particular thelink between the Greek mysteries and patristic views of the sacraments.He concluded that the Fathers had indeed adopted quite a number ofterms, rites and ceremonies from the “ancient superstitions,” although headded that in doing so, they had turned them into something pious andgood. Casaubon’s focus here was on the influence of pagan rites ratherthan of philosophy, but he must be seen as a pioneer in recognizingthe importance of analyzing the relation between Hellenistic culture andChristianity.76The first author who fully developed the concept of a “Hellenization ofChristianity” was, interestingly, again a Jesuit, although one who had beeninfluenced by Casaubon. With his unfinishedDe theologicis dogmatibus(1644–1650) in five volumes, Denis P ́etau (Dionysius Petavius) was the firstto treat the development of Christian doctrine systematically from a his-torical point of view.77Like Crispo, he pinpointed platonism as the source72Yates,Giordano Bruno,398–403(cf.Chapter1,page74and n.290).73Pattison,Isaac Casaubon,196.74Pattison,Isaac Casaubon,325; cf. the chapter on Baronius as a historian in Pullapilly,Caesar Baronius,144–177.

P ́etau’s actual intention was to emphasize theCouncil of Nicaea as the foundation of the true doctrine, while criticizingthe ante-Nicene Fathers who still tended to be claimed by Protestants;but that strategy was bound to backfire, as Protestants came to apply theanti-platonic critique ever more rigidly toallthe Fathers, whether beforeor after Nicaea.78Particularly good examples are several works by the Arminian Jean leClerc published in the final decades of the seventeenth century, who tracedthe process of Hellenization back even further.79Judaism itself had alreadybeen Hellenized by the time of the apostles, with Philo as the clearestexample, and platonic elements could be found in the Gospel of John. Theallegorical method of scriptural exegesis, which had perverted the literalunderstanding of the Bible, had been adopted by the Fathers from Jewslike Philo, who in turn had been inspired by the Egyptians and the Greeks,who had been accustomed to hiding the secrets of their philosophy underthe guise of emblems and fables; and thedisciplina arcanaof the Fatherswas likewise an imitation of pagan cultic practices transmitted by way ofthe Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Epicureans. As a result of such influencesfrom pagan philosophy, the purity and simplicity of the gospel was lost,and heretical sects began to spread.The works of P ́etau and le Clerc are merely two of the more prominentand important examples of a large stream of similar works published duringthe later seventeenth century. What they all have in common is that theydescribe the Church, since the early centuries, as having been influenced –that is to say, perverted – by Hellenistic culture and by platonism inparticular. The culmination of this genre came in1700,withafamoustreatise entitledLe platonisme d ́evoil ́e, the first monographic treatment ofthe concept of Hellenization.80It was published anonymously but is nowgenerally attributed to Jacques Souverain, a former Reformed minister whohad been removed from his office because of Arminian sympathies, andeventually went to England, where he became an Anglican.

Unfortunately, and ironically, many of the early Fathers had takenthis allegorical sense literally, resulting in quasi-polytheist understandingsof the Trinity as three persons. From this perspective, Souverain denouncedthem, along with their modern heirs, as covert Gnostics and heretics,81andassociated them with the kabbalah as well:I make no distinction at all between the JewishCabala& the ValentinianPleroma:these two systems are either equally ridiculous, that is if you take them literally, orthey are equally reasonable, that is if you search in them for the hidden sense thatrests under the cortex of allegory.

For our concerns, most important is the fact that, in the centuryafter Crispo, those who denounced platonism as the essence of paganerror no longer perceived it only as an enemy coming from outside,but had begun to see it as a virus that had infected Christianity fromwithin, starting with the Patristic apologists.

During the periodroughly between the mid-sixteenth and the mid-seventeenth century, thequestion of the origins of philosophy and its historical development up tothe present became an important focus of interest for intellectuals, leadingto a copious literature that still remains largely unknown today.83It isclear that in most of this material, the general chronological frameworkremained compatible with Platonic Orientalism. For example, aDisputatioprima de origine philosophiaeof1565, published by Jean Riolan, asserted thatphilosophy was not a human invention but a gift from God, as confirmedby the Indian Brahmins, the PersianMagi, the Egyptian priests, the Hebrewprophets, the Gallic Druids, the Orphic poets, the Pythagoreans and allthe platonic philosophers.84In1576, Benito Pereira devoted a book tothe ancient philosophers, emphasizing that there had been sages amongall the “barbarian” peoples, whose philosophy was not only more ancientbut also much purer than that of the Greeks.85A very similar emphasison the primacy of the barbarians over the Greeks as the inventors ofphilosophy can be found in many other historians over the decades tofollow,86from a Counter-Reformation author like Ludovico Carbonari87all the way – surprisingly – to even a Dutch Protestant like Otto van83Tolomio, “‘Historia Philosophica’.” He usefully distinguishes four main categories in the historiog-raphy of philosophy during this period, but my concern here is mainly with the continuity of theassumptions basic to the ancient wisdom narrative.

Hencetheir approach has usefully been labeled “anti-apologeticism”:91a termwhich emphasizes their ambition of developing a radical alternative tothe patristic apologetic tradition, which they held responsible not onlyfor the pernicious “Hellenization of Christianity” since the first centuries,but (eventually) for a parallel degeneration of philosophy into pseudo-philosophy as well. In analyzing the anti-apologetic current, we will findthat its main representatives systematized the anti-pagan, anti-platonic andanti-patristic perspectives, sketched in the earlier sections of this chapter,into a logically coherent narrative based upon a peculiar combination ofcritical historiography and a rigorous insistence on the exclusive truth ofProtestantism as opposed to pagan error in all its forms.The story of anti-apologeticism begins with Jacob Thomasius (1622–1684),92father of the more famous Christian Thomasius, and one of the88Heurnius,Barbaricae philosophiae antiquitatum libri duo(1600).

He built up a strong reputation as a pedagogue, andproduced a large oeuvre of learned studies in the domains of philosophy,theology, church history, philology, and literary theory. Undoubtedly hismost important and lasting contribution to the history of philosophy waspublished in1665under the titleSchediasma historicum, and it is on thisrelatively short but seminal work that I will concentrate.93As will be seen,theSchediasmawas revolutionary in its radical and systematic manner ofdistinguishing pagan philosophy from biblical religion. Thomasius wentmuch further in this regard than other early historians of philosophy, suchas Georg Hornius and Gerhard Johannes Vossius,94and his argument wasbased upon a combination of careful philosophical analysis and historicalcriticism. He has sometimes been regarded as the founder of the history ofphilosophy as a discipline, and for good reason; but it is important to under-stand that his basic source of motivation was not philosophical or historical,but dogmatic. His goal was to “purify” Christian theology from its con-tamination by pagan error.95However, as the theoretical implications of hisapproach were further developed by his successors, not only did this resultin the autonomization of history of philosophy as a discipline (not to men-tion that of “Western esotericism,” as will be seen), but also in profoundproblems for Christian theology: as pointed out by Sicco Lehmann-Braunsin his indispensable study of the anti-apologetic current, Thomasius’ razor-sharp distinction between the philosophy of antiquity and the religion ofChristianity may have been drawn with the most pious of intentions, butended up undermining the very orthodoxy it was supposed to defend.96Thomasius’ explorations were guided by a strongly professed “love ofhistorical truth,” and a severe rejection of any attempt to manipulate it forthe sake of promoting personal interests of whatever kind, including thoseof historians.97The goal should be to discover what the philosophers beingand particularly the brilliant analysis in Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,21–111.

A primaryexample of such syncretism is the “concordist” approach of the ancientwisdom narrative: in a misguided attempt to make pagan philosophy appearcompatible with Christianity, it ends up creating a confused mixture ofboth, which makes pagans look like half-Christians and Christians like half-pagans.98Thomasius will have nothing of this: “where history is concerned,I cannot go against my principles by trying to persuade others that what Isee to be Ethiopians are actually swans.”99Pagan philosophy and biblicaltruth are entirely different animals: blurring the distinction between themresults in bad history as well as doctrinal confusion.As already noted, Thomasius was not just a critical historian of phi-losophy. First and foremost, he was a pious Lutheran who believed thatthe biblical revelation was the only reliable source of religious truth andwho saw the history of Christianity from the patristic period to the Ref-ormation as a history of error and degeneration, along the general linesof the “Magdeburg Centuries.” However, whereas Flacius Illyricus and hiscollaborators had pointed to the papacy as the diabolical cause of Christianperversion, for Thomasius the ultimate source of heresy was pagan philos-ophy, and platonism in particular.100Having read Crispo and other criticsof the Platonism of the Fathers, the patristic apologists were no longera stumbling block for Thomasius: it was clear to him that by misinter-preting platonic philosophy as compatible with Christian faith they hadintroduced the virus of Hellenistic paganism.But what was it, precisely, that made pagan philosophies so utterly aliento biblical revelation? Historically, Thomasius traced all of them to theirorigin in the dualistic doctrine of Zoroaster and the PersianMagi, whichin turn had been inspired by the devil:101it was from this barbarian sourcethat philosophy had reached Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle and the other98Thomasius,Schediasma Historicum§46note o; cf. §42on Hermes Trismegistus as a “Platonichalf-Christian.”99Thomasius,De stoica mundi exustione§20and note p, here quoted according to Micheli, “Historyof Philosophy in Germany,”416.100Thomasius’ view of aristotelianism is more complex and beyond the scope of our discussion.

In their different ways, all these variations amountedto deification of the creation at the expense of its Creator.105For Thomasius, the temptation of man by this ultimately diabolicaldoctrine of pagan philosophy was a direct parallel to the temptation ofAdam and Eve that had resulted in the Fall, and accordingly, the Christianrevelation was presented by him as its radical salvational counterpart.106Butalthough the coming of Christ should have spelled the end of paganism,through the devil’s machinations its basic philosophical doctrine succeededin infiltrating Christian theology, particularly in the form of platonism. Anysuch continuation of pagan philosophy under the guise of Christianity wasunderstood by Thomasius as a case of syncretism, and thus as heresy,whether it occurred in the Fathers and Roman Catholic doctrine or inthe various forms of gnosticism and other sectarian movements that hadsprouted from the “arch-heretic” Simon Magus.107As a result, theentirehistory of the Church prior to the Reformation became synonymous withthe history of heresy. As formulated by Lehmann-Brauns,From this perspective, without the pagan counterpart there would be no history ofChristian theology at all, for although its center had manifested itself historically inthe (New Testament) Revelation, it [i.e. theology] was not itself subject to historicaldevelopment, and moreover, was impervious to any philosophical analysis. Thehistory of Christianity, in contrast, was dominated by the contrast between pagan102Thomasius,Schediasma§34andnotek.103Ibid., §19note c.104Actually the doctrine ofcreatio ex nihilois not biblical but was first formulated in the secondcentury by Theophilus of Antioch (Apol. ad Autolycum,2.4).105The conceptual logic of monotheism implies that such deification, in turn, is a form of the ultimatesin of idolatry (see Hanegraaff, “Idolatry,”82–83).106Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,43(“Die antike Philosophie galt gleich dem S ̈undenfall alsVe r f ̈uhrungsversuch”).

I argued in the first chapter that the Renaissance narrative ofAncient Wisdom was based upon the paradoxical concept of a historyof truth. Thomasius’ Protestant counter-narrative, in contrast, recognizedthat ultimate religious truth cannot be subject to change and developmentwithout losing its absoluteness, and therefore cannot have a history. Itfollowed that the history of thought could only be a history of error.Thomasius considered the Reformation as the most thorough attemptat a de-Hellenization of Christianity thus far, but in his own centuryhe was concerned about seeing the pagan heresies of platonism makingtheir comeback even in Protestant contexts. He predicted, quite accu-rately, that these forms of heterodox spiritualism would spread ever morein the decades to come.109The central characteristic of this new devel-opment was “enthusiasm” (Enthusiasmus,Schw ̈armerei), that is to say, theextreme emphasis on personal religious or even ecstatic experience at theexpense of doctrinal belief.110Like all manifestations of heresy, enthusi-asm was based upon the core error of the eternity of the world: in thiscase in the form of the platonic doctrine of emanation and restitution,which held that the soul has its origin in an eternal, divine substance andwill return to it again. Emanationism implied that human beings couldreturn to God by attaining direct experiential knowledge of their owndivine nature, by means of “ecstatic” states of mind, and this was clearlyequivalent to the quintessential gnostic heresy of auto-salvation and deifi-cation by means of a salvational gnosis. Hence Thomasius was able todraw a straight line from Simon Magus and the various gnostic sects inthe early history of the Church, all the way to the enthusiasm of spir-itualist and early pietist currents in his own time.

For our concerns, most impor-tant is the fact that it laid the conceptual foundations for the landmark bookthat gave birth to the study of Western esotericism as a specific domain ofresearch: Ehregott Daniel Colberg’sPlatonisch-Hermetisches Christenthumof1690–1691.114the heresiologist: ehregott daniel colbergAnybody who opens Colberg’s book should be prepared to enter a dog-matic battlefield in the company of an author who is shooting to kill.The work consists of an uncompromising and frontal attack against whatwas known as the “fanatical” or “enthusiastic” theology typical of themilieus of Reformation spiritualism, with strong emphasis on Paracel-sianism, Weigelianism, Rosicrucianism, and Christian theosophy in thetradition of Jacob B ̈ohme. Considering Colberg’s extreme hostility to thesecurrents and their ideas, and the fact that he studied them not for theirown sake but in order to destroy their credibility, what is it that makes himinto a pioneering figure in the study of Western esotericism? The answeris that his book was the first one to outline a complete and internallyconsistent historiographical concept that connected everything nowadays112Thomasius,Schediasma§34note k; cf. §28note r.113Micheli, “History of Philosophy in Germany,”439–442.114Hanegraaff, “Birth of Esotericism,”209–212. The first modern scholar of Western esotericism tohave called attention to Colberg’s importance in this regard seems to have been Antoine Faivre, inan article co-published with Karen-Claire Voss in1995(“Western Esotericism and the Science ofReligion,”55;andseealsoFaivre,Acc`es,vol.ii,73–78)."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"108The history of errorstudied under that rubric: not only did Colberg draw lines of continuityfrom the platonic and hermetic currents of late antiquity through thoseof the Renaissance and onward to the present day, but he managed to doso on the basis of a clearly formulated theory of how and why they wereall hanging together. In short, “Platonic-Hermetic Christianity” emergedfrom Colberg’s book as a specific religious domain with an identity ofits own –notby virtue of its supposed participation in a timeless realmof metaphysical truth, but on the basis of an analysis of what had beenbelieved and proclaimed by its historical representatives.In his battle against heterodoxy, Colberg (1659–1698) followed closely inthe footsteps of his father, Johannes Colberg, a belligerent Lutheran minis-ter of very strict persuasions whose life and career were dominated by theo-logical conflicts.115Father and son both became professors at the Universityof Greifswald, where Ehregott Daniel wrote hisPlatonisch-HermetischesChristenthumalong with other treatises on the history of heresy116andpractical theology. Although he received an ordinary professorship in1691,he left that position three years later, to spend the last years of his ratherbrief life as a minister in Wismar.Colberg’sPlatonisch-Hermetisches Christenthumis conceptually gro-unded in the radical critique of syncretism developed in Thomasius’Sche-diasma, which is extensively quoted; but it is important to see that Colbergdoes not consider philosophy to be evil in itself. It is only the mingling ofphilosophy with biblical faith that must be condemned:The greatest – I would almost say: the only – danger for theology comes from thescandalousmixing of philosophical teachings and the Word of God. For although thephilosophical arts and sciences are, in and for themselves, a wondrous gift of Godfrom which great profit can be drawn in civil life, and which, if rightly applied,can be of no small use in other respects as well, they create much confusion ifthey are applied to the divine mysteries of revelation and transcend their naturalboundaries of reason.117The basic argument is strikingly similar to what we encountered alreadyin Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola’sExamen vanitatis. With referenceto the apostle Paul (Coll.2:8), Colberg continues by emphasizing that115On the lives and careers of father and son, see Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,112–114.Byfarthemostcomplete critical discussion of Colberg and his work is Lehmann-Brauns,ibid.,112–186; but seealso the shorter analysis by Schneider, “DasPlatonisch-Hermetische Christenthum.”116See notably hisSpecimen historicum de origine & progressu haeresium & errorum in ecclesiaand hisSapientia veterum Hebraeorum(both1694; for an analysis of the latter, see Micheli, “The Historyof Philosophy in Germany,”460–473).117Colberg,Platonisch-Hermetisches Christenthum,vol.i, Vorrede (pp.1–2).

The gospel is a teaching “which has been hiddenfrom the beginning, which is not grasped or understood by the humanmind, but has been revealed by the son of God.”118Now the “mingling oftheology and philosophy” can take two forms:First, if one tries to be smarter than Scripture, that is, if with the help of philosophyone tries to fathom the nature of the revealed mysteries about which God’s Wordkeeps silent.Second, if one tries to be smart against Scripture, that is, if one refusesto accept what does not accord with the blind intellect and its invented axioms.119The second type is represented mainly by aristotelian philosophy, leadingto the “philosophical fancies and school quarrels” of the medieval scholas-tics, but Colberg’s true concern is with the first type. It was widespreadin the early Church, including the work of Fathers such as Origen andClement of Alexandria, who maintained many of their earlier platonicbeliefs after their conversion;120it is the core approach of Simon Magusand his many followers, such as the Menandrians, Saturnians, Nicolaites,Gnostics, Marcionites, Carpocratians, Valentinians, and Manichaeans;121and it was continued during the Middle Ages in the monasteries andtheTheologia mysticain the wake of Dionysius the Areopagite and Scot-us Eriugena.122Much of the papist and scholastic darkness was dispersedthanks to “the faithful effort of the holy Luther” (des heiligen Lutheri)but, sadly, Satan continued to spread the bad seeds of syncretism.123Fromhis many personal discussions with Weigelians and B ̈ohmians, and fromstudying their writings, Colberg had discovered that their entire philosophywas still based upon the same pernicious mingling of Christian faith withplatonic and hermetic philosophy, and this he now set out to demonstrate.118Ibid., Vorrede (p.4).119Ibid., Vorrede (pp.5–6).120Ibid., Vorrede (p.7)andi.6–8(pp.26–37).121Ibid., Vorrede (pp.7–8)andi.5(pp.19–26).122Ibid.,i.11–16(pp.47–88). By including theTheologia mystica, Colberg went much further thanThomasius, and it earned him severe criticism by Jacob’s son Christian (Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,130–131). That both Jacob and Christian Thomasius refused to include the mystical theology underthe rubric of pagan heresy is important for evaluating their intellectual positions, as carefullyanalyzed by Lehmann-Brauns. That Thomasius senior saw Johann Arndt’sVier B ̈uchern vomwahren Christentumas exemplifying an acceptableTheologia mystica, placing it in a tradition ofnon-enthusiastic speculative mysticism (Schediasma§54note i; and Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,104–108) is significant and ironic, given the fact that Arndt’s theology has recently been analyzedas “spiritualist-hermetic” in a major study by Hermann Geyer,Verborgene Weisheit. Exploring theactual relations between Protestant spiritualism, pietism, and the currents denounced as “Platonic-Hermetic” by Colberg would lead us far beyond the present study’s limitations, but remains aparticularly important desideratum in the study of Western esotericism.123Colberg,Platonisch-Hermetisches Christenthum,vol.i, Vorrede (p.13)."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"110The history of errorIn tracing heresy back to its historical origins, the primacy of the “bar-barians” over the Greeks seems to have become a non-issue for Colberg, forreasons that are not very difficult to guess. Whether the pagan philosophiescome from Chaldaea, Egypt, Greece, or anywhere else is simply of no greatconsequence in his narrative: all that matters is their pernicious influenceonce they come into contact with Christianity. Colberg belonged to a gen-eration for which the late date of the Hermetica was common knowledge,Zoroaster was simply ignored by him, and he evidently did not believe inthe great antiquity of the kabbalah either.124Hence his story begins withPythagoras, whose entire philosophy was focused on the search for deifica-tion by means of self-knowledge or gnosis, purification from “the filth ofthe body,” and the “way inward.”125Plato continued these teachings andmade them famous; he developed some kind of Trinitarian theory, whichshould not be confused with the Christian one, but has been taken up byWe i g e l , B ̈ohme, and others. From Plato on, the line is continued throughthe early Fathers, Simon Magus and all later heretics, and the various formsofTheologia mystica, as already indicated.Why did Colberg choose to call the syncretistic tradition “Platonic-Hermetic”? Having traced the “platonic” line from Pythagoras to the presentin sections1–16of his first chapter, he discussed the hermetic componentin the final three sections. Apparently, he needed Hermes Trismegistus asa bridge to connect platonism with the “chymical”NaturphilosophieofParacelsus, Weigel, B ̈ohme, and the Rosicrucians:Also it should not be forgotten that the desire to investigate the foundation ofchymistry [Chymie] – which, according to its devotees, provides the right scientificfoundation for investigating and understanding divine and natural things – hasdriven many newcomers to read the writings of Hermes Trismegistus, and, sincethey found there many platonicFundamenta, to conclude that nobody could findthe way back to the original wisdom lost in Adam except by purifying himself fromthe uncleanliness of the body and being enlightened, partly through Scripture,partly through the Book of Nature, that is, theCabala vera,Magia,AstrologiaandPansophia.126Alchemy and the hermetic books are considered to be among the mainreasons for the recent spread of “fanaticism.” Colberg refers to theCorpusHermeticumto prove that Hermes Trismegistus teaches a form of platonism,but goes on to emphasize his traditional status as founder of alchemyin order to connect hermetic platonism with the “pansophical” study of124Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,132.125Colberg,Platonisch-Hermetisches Christenthum,vol.i, i.2(pp.4–7).126Ibid.,i.17(p.89)."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The heresiologist: Ehregott Daniel Colberg111the Book of Nature. In other words, he takes advantage of the fact thatHermes Trismegistus is seen as the author of (in modern terminology)the “philosophical” as well as the “technical” Hermetica. But Colberg alsonotes that whatever his modern admirers may believe about Hermes, itis all “a poem without foundations,” since the hermetic writings wereevidently written after the birth of Christ, as demonstrated by Casaubonand others.127In Colberg’s heresiological imagination, the many “sects” of Platonic-Hermetic Christianity were like a filthy breed of vermin (Geschmeiss)thathad come crawling from the “platonic egg.”128He kept emphasizing thatalthough its sectarian divisions were many, they all agreed in essence. Godis the “spirit of the universe” and manifests himself as a triple power fromwhich emerges a triple world (a spiritual/angelical world, a hidden astralworld of power and light, and the external world of the elements). Thehuman soul is a particle of the divine essence that should rest in God;but misusing its freedom and following its own will instead of God’s, itturned towards the external world and alienated itself from the divinesource. As a result, it became a triple being consisting of soul, spirit, anda “coarse, animal, earthly” body; and this fall into matter is what is meantby sin. To find the way back, man must attain self-knowledge, and thedesire for returning to his source must be awakened in him. To attain thatgoal, he must purify himself from sin by overcoming his bodily passions(“Affekten”) and his selfish will. Having thus “killed the old Adam” byrelinquishing his own will and his passions, he will have become sinless,and in a passive state ofGelassenheitcan give himself wholly over to God’swill. He will then experience an inner illumination or rebirth, and bereunited with the inner Christ, which is another word for deification (hewill be “verg ̈ottert und verchristet”). The body is left behind, and will neverrise again.129Colberg put particular emphasis on the enthusiasts’ obsession with dis-tinguishing each and every thing into “external” and “internal.” Whilerejecting the “things of this world,” they internalize all theological con-cepts and speak of the inner word of God, the inner Christ, inner faith,inner justification, inner sanctification, inner prayer, inner sacraments,inner eucharist, inner absolution, inner cult, inner calling, inner teaching,inner heaven, and inner hell. Colberg finishes by reducing the Platonic-Hermetic theology to its ultimate core: its belief in the “spiritus universi127Ibid.,i.19(pp.98–100).128Ibid.,i.16(p.75). Cf.

The first onefocuses on knowledge of one’s self (the microcosm) through inner illumi-nation, the other on knowledge of the world (the macrocosm) throughreading the Book of Nature. Although this clearly reflects his general dis-tinction of “platonic” and “hermetic,” Colberg continues by referring to thetwo (rather confusingly) asCabalaandMagia. This peculiar understandingofCabalareflected hardly any real familiarity with Jewish kabbalah, butseems to have been based rather on a quotation (attributed to anIsagogeby Paracelsus) that must have impressed Colberg:TheCabalais the Olympian spirit, or the sacramental body of the inner, spiritual,deified manin Amadei: seeing into the heavenly thrones and the truth of Godwith the bodily eyes of the heart [des Gem ̈utes]. From this, the holyCabalagivesus to understand that we men can know all things, like the angels and the spirits,insofar as God permits it . . .131Colberg specifies that this does not refer to the “literal and superstitious”kabbalah, which is focused on manipulating letters and words, but to thetype known asMercava. He was adopting the distinction from RobertFludd, and found confirmation of his view of kabbalah as a form of pla-tonism in Abraham Cohen Herrera’s “Gates of Heaven,” which he knewin the Latin translation of Knorr von Rosenroth’sKabbala Denudata.132This was a convenient choice, for Herrera himself had interpreted Luri-anic kabbalah in strongly neoplatonic terms, and the very title of the(heavily doctored) version printed in Knorr’s compendium emphasized itsprogram of demonstrating the harmony between kabbalistic and platonicphilosophy.133To Colberg’s program, with its background in Thomasius’thesis about the “eternity of the world,” it was particularly important that,130Ibid.,ii.7(p.118).131Ibid.,iii.3(pp.136–137).132“Liber Scha’ar ha-Schamaiim seu Porta Coelorum,” in: Knorr von Rosenroth,Kabbala Denudata,vol.ii.133See discussion in Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,171–177. Knorr’s was a Latin translation of IsaacAboab’s Hebrew translation of the Spanish original; and Aboab and Knorr had both stronglymanipulated and partly paraphrased the latter, resulting in a strongly reduced version that presentedkabbalah as a “concise neoplatonic system” (ibid.,172)."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The heresiologist: Ehregott Daniel Colberg113from this perspective, the kabbalistic Adam Kadmon could be interpretedas an equivalent of the neoplatonic “first intellect” or of the “world spirit.”134Next toCabala, the second form of Platonic-Hermetic Christianity wasMagia. Colberg mentioned the common distinction between diabolicaland natural magic, but emphasized that the Enthusiasts speak, rather,of a “divine supernatural magic.”135Julius Sperber divided it into threetypes, Robert Fludd into four; but essentially,Magiameans “knowledgeof divine and natural things from the Book of Nature.”136Here, of course,Colberg was referring to notions such as the Adamic Ur-language and thedoctrine of signatures in the tradition of Paracelsus or Oswald Croll: bylearning to read this mysterious script of the “language of nature,” one wassupposed to gain access to the hidden ideas in the light-world of thespiritusuniversi.For assessing the impact of Colberg’s work, perhaps his own (often rathersloppy) definitions and demarcations are less important than the simplefact that he brought all these loaded terms into close connection with oneanother under one general rubric and presented them as parts of one unifiedtradition. Most readers would probably not remember the exact mannerin which Colberg defined, or tried to distinguish between, enthusiasm,paganism, mysticism, platonism, hermetism, kabbalah, or magic, but theycertainly got the point: that under so many names, one always encoun-tered the same heretical doctrine. In other words, Colberg’sPlatonisch-Hermetisches Christenthumamounted to a compendium of all traditionalclaims that needed to be rejected by Christians:And now we should overturn this double foundation of the Neo-Pythagorean andPlatonic Theology, and show that theCabalaand the divine revelation that springsfrom it is nothing, that no such Light-World or threefold common World-Spiritis to be found, that the Magical letters of light that are supposed to be present inall created things . . . are Jewish and Pagan fairy-tales . . .137Even though it is clear to see that all these claims are groundless, Colbergcontinues, it is still necessary to refute them in detail. Partly this is becausethe enthusiasts are used to hiding their true meaning under “ambiguousand dark manners of expression,” probably because they are afraid thatotherwise their pagan and even atheist beliefs would be all too obvious.138Furthermore, deep down they know that their beliefs have no foundation,and therefore they refuse to give arguments or engage in discussion and134See analysis in Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,171–177, esp.173–174.135Colberg,Platonisch-Hermetisches Christenthum,vol.i, iii.4(p.151).136Ibid.,iii.4(p.153).137Ibid.,iii.6(p.174).138Ibid.,iii.6(p.175)."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"114The history of errorinsist instead on blind belief and obedience: “Hence they reject philosophyand dispute, so that their opinions may not be brought to the light andinvestigated, for they do not hold up.”139Here it must be noted that,his extreme Protestant dogmatism notwithstanding, Colberg was rejectingthe discourse of secrecy and mystery by formulating principles of clearlanguage and open rational discussion that were to become foundationalto the Enlightenment agenda and modern critical scholarship.Thus to bring the doctrines of the Enthusiasts out into the open andmake them available for critical discussion, the rest of Colberg’s first volumeconsisted of detailed chapter-by-chapter discussions of the main forms of“enthusiasm,” particularly Paracelsianism, Weigelianism, Rosicrucianism,and B ̈ohmian theosophy.140The second volume covered the whole terrainonce again, this time from a systematic angle.

Its conceptualcenter was, again, the doctrine of emanation, and B ̈ucher spoke about thewhole tradition in drastic terms as “Satan’s school of the Platonists andKabbalists.”143While connections between heterodox Protestant spiritu-alism and pietism had often been drawn before, it was B ̈ucher who nowprovided such associations with a theoretical foundation, by using the logicof anti-apologeticism to describe them both as latter-day manifestationsof the grand heretical tradition of platonism. In its pietist manifestation,B ̈ucher argued, ecstatic states (innerliche Entz ̈uckungen) were now under-stood as providing immediate divine knowledge, so that all traditionalmeans of salvation (the Bible, the sacraments, divine grace, ecclesiasticalinstitutions) became superfluous.

In yet another variation on the patristic “theft of the Greeks” motive,K ̈opke argued that there was much truth in Greek philosophy, but it hadall been adopted from Judaism:Socrates, Zeno, Plato, and Aristotle have written many good things . . . Their livesand teachings are similar in many respects to the divine truth and wisdom, anda cause for shame for many Christians. In Egypt they have had dealings with theJews, and undoubtedly have seen and read the Holy Scripture...But they havenot admitted it, so that they might reap fame from it and would not be second tothe Jews; so they have presented it covertly and by other words, and mixed it withpagan fables, so that their own people, who disliked the Jews and their doctrine,would take no notice, but would accept it all the more eagerly. Thus, in manydivine things they have nevertheless possessed the truth, in particular the\u001a\u001e\u0018\u0006\u001a!\f\u0019\u001a, the knowledge of God . . . and have known and taught it quite well, againstthe vulgar polytheistic opinions of the people.146Thus we see that in response to critics such as Thomasius and Colberg,K ̈opke’s pietist alternative amounted to yet another variation on the ancientwisdom narrative; and this included a rehabilitation of the early Fathersof the Church, who had not really been platonists but had merely usedplatonic terminology as allegorical confirmation of the revealed truth ofmonotheism.147As indicated by the very title of his book, which men-tioned the “false and pagan philosophy of Plato,” K ̈opkewasashardon145Spener, “Erste Vorrede!” §12.146K ̈opke,Sapientia Dei§21(p.43).147Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,243–246."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The pietist reaction117paganism as his anti-apologetic opponents, describing the Egyptians asdrenched in the “most shameful idolatry and blindness,” as shown by thefact that they built temples to worship “creatures of the most horriblekind (shocking to human nature),” and as also shown by his treatment ofHermes Trismegistus:In the meantime the Egyptian sages still retained much that resembled the truth,but out of hate and envy they did not want to admit that they had received itfrom Joseph and the descendants of Jacob; instead, they attributed it to anotherauthor or original source, whom they called Hermes or Mercurius, about whomall kinds of things can be read in the pagan writers . . . But it should be notedthat some scholars attribute the writings that the world has come to know underthe name of Hermes Trismegistus not to the ancient Egyptian Mercurius, but toa much younger philosopher, who lived after the birth of Christ, and claim thathe was nothing but acento, or (similar to how Luther speaks about the al-Koranof Muhammad) a beggar’s mantle patched together from the Christian, Platonicand Egyptian doctrine . . . Therefore the origin of the false mystical stuff actuallycomes from the envious imitation of the aforementioned people, and from themingling of divine and worldly wisdom.148Furthermore, K ̈opke agreed with his anti-apologetic opponents in rejectingthe doctrine of the eternity of the world; but unlike them, he arguedthat the early Greek philosophers had adopted the teaching ofcreatio exnihilofrom the Jews, and the turn towards heresy had occurred only at alater stage. The true doctrine had declined among both the Jews and thepagans, until it was restored by Christ. Simon Magus and the other Gnosticheretics had then tried to reintroduce the pagan error of the eternity of theworld:The first and worst impostor was Simon Magus with his followers, who hassown weeds among the grain. Outside the churches, the pagan philosophers hadreunited against Christianity in their opinion about the eternity of the world,which was also adopted by the platonists who had not converted, and who outof Plato’s writings sought to prove the opinion that the matter from which theworld is made is uncreated and co-eternal with God, so that in this way theymight all the more strongly contradict Christianity and its promise of eternallife.149Thus in K ̈opke’s argument, an acceptable lineage of Jewish wisdom trans-mitted partly by pagans could be distinguished from a heretical counter-tradition of pure paganism.

Published in1700, this title contains the entire program of thework: it assumes that church history cannot be discussed separately fromthe history of philosophy, and argues that the true theology grounded inthe “mystery of the cross” has been available not just since the birth ofChrist, but since the very beginning of the world.Zierold referred explicitly to the authority of the patristic apologists,particularly Origen, Clement, and Eusebius.151From this perspective, hetried to turn the tables on B ̈ucher by placing him in the same camp as theiranti-Christian opponents: philosophers like Celsus or Porphyry!152Whatthey had in common was their rejection of the humble “piety of the heart”which, in Zierold’s view, had been the true core of the one revealed religion.Any such piety was grounded in a deeply felt recognition that, due to theFall, man had lost his original paradisical state of participation in God’sbeing and wisdom. Only on the basis of such a profound sense of humansinfulness – the “mystery of the cross,” which had been intuited alreadyby the most ancient sages – was it possible for man to purify himself andregain his lost divinity. Zierold sharply opposed this meek and humblepietism to the arrogance of the philosophers and their worldly belief inthe autonomy of human reason.

Due to the Fall, the true piety had already declinedin antediluvian times, but it was preserved by Noah. Like many pre-Enlightenment historians, Zierold believed that after the Flood, all theworld’s peoples and cultures had descended from Noah’s sons. For him,this meant that they stood at the origin of – broadly speaking – the Oriental,African, and Mediterranean traditions:Ancestor➔Peoples/culturesMost important sageShem➔Assyrians, Chaldaeans, Lydians, Syrians, Arabs,Armenians, Indians.ZoroasterHam➔African peoples, incl. Egyptians.HermesJafeth➔Galatians, Celts, Scythians, Iberians,Cappadocians, Greeks.PlatoAs pointed out by Lehmann-Brauns, this meant that all forms of ancientpaganism were included in a Jewish–Christian biblical narrative: Zierold’sapproach left no room for paganism as a competing counter-tradition,and hence “error” of any kind could only be described in terms of declineor deviation from the one ancient truth.153This wisdom tradition wasgrounded in monotheism and taught that the world had been createdby God: polytheism and belief in the eternity of the world were laterperversions. The original language of wisdom had been Hebrew, and thedecline of true piety went hand in hand with the decline of this perfectlanguage. Zierold was particularly radical in his manner of preserving thecentrality of Moses: Moses was the crucial ancient sage indeed, for notonly was he the author of the Pentateuch, but (in spite of the divisioninto three post-Noachite streams located in different geographical areas)Zierold suggested that he was probably identical with both ZoroasterandHermes!154It was not these ancient pagan traditions that were the sourcesof heresy, but the impious philosophy of Aristotle. As for Plato: he stoodin the lineage of Egyptian wisdom mediated by Pythagoras, but had alsolearned much from the Jews and had read the Pentateuch.155All theseancient traditions finally led towards their culmination in the gospel.153Ibid.,253.154Ibid.,254–260.155Ibid.,260–265."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"120The history of errorthe birth of religionism: gottfried arnoldK ̈opke and, particularly, Zierold were well-known authors in Germanyaround1700(theGroße Zedlerof1732–1754introduces the latter as “afamous Lutheran theologian,” and devotes a long and detailed article tohim), but while they are important to our story, they are almost com-pletely forgotten today. This cannot be said about the radical pietistGottfried Arnold, author of the famousUnparteyische Kirchen- und Ketzer-Historiepublished in1699–1700.156There are several reasons to consider thiswork as the major historiographical counterpart to Colberg’sPlatonisch-Hermetisches Christenthum. Most obviously, theImpartial Historysought torehabilitate as “Christian” most of the currents that had been denouncedas quasi-pagan heresy by the anti-apologists; but even more importantfor our concerns, it introduced a novel theoretical perspective that wouldeventually become of great importance to the modern study of Westernesotericism. It will be argued here that, whereas Colberg was the earliestpioneer of “Western esotericism” as a historiographical concept, Arnold isthe originator of its “religionist” alternative, to which I will return at lengthinChapter4.The first thing to notice about Arnold’sImpartial Historyis its strikinglack of interest in the entire problem of the historical relation betweenpaganism, or pagan philosophy, and Christianity. It is illustrative of thisapproach that, in his opening pages, all that Arnold has to say about thereligious environment in which Christianity was born is how “miserableand depraved” the whole world had been at the moment when the lightof the gospel began to shine.157The Jewish religion was in a sorry statedue to the degeneration of its priests, and among the pagan peoples thesituation was even worse: they were living “like dumb cattle” under thedomination of a corrupt priesthood and its “self-invented religion,” andtheir quarreling philosophers had absolutely nothing better to offer.158Arnold knew the works of Thomasius Sr. and Colberg, and politely referredto them from time to time, but here and elsewhere in hisImpartial Historyhe systematically refused to be drawn into any historical-critical discussionabout whether, or how, pagan philosophy might be related to Christianityin any of its forms, whether “heretical” or “orthodox.”159156The extensive secondary literature on Arnold is documented in Blaufuß and Niew ̈ohner,GottfriedArnold,415–424(up to1993).157Arnold,Unparteyische Geschichte,29(Bk.i§1.2).158Ibid.,30(Bk.i§1.6–7).159The very few passing references in Arnold’sUnparteyische Geschichteto pagan and platonic influ-ences are discussed in Glawe,Hellenisierung,105–107.

The classic referencecomesfromTertullian’sDe praescriptione haereticorum:Hence [i.e. from philosophy] spring those “fables and endless genealogies” (1Tim.1:4) and “fruitless questions and words” (Tit.3:9) which “spread like a cancer”(2Tim.2:17). Wishing to restrain us from them, the apostle specifically statesthat we should be on our guard against philosophy and vain deceit, when hewrites to the Colossians: “See that no one beguile you through philosophy andvain deceit, after the tradition of men” (Col.2:8), and contrary to the wisdomof the Holy Ghost. He had been at Athens, and had through his meetings [withits philosophers] come to know that human wisdom which pretends to know thetruth but only corrupts it, and is itself divided into its own manifold heresies, bythe variety of its mutually repugnant sects. What indeed has Athens to do withJerusalem, the Academy with the Church, heretics with Christians?160Surprising though it might seem at first sight, Arnold’s entireImpartialHistorywas grounded in this radical anti-apologetic approach, but theconclusions he drew from it were very different from those of Thom-asius Sr. and Colberg. These authors had criticized the pernicious influ-ence of “Athens” (platonic philosophy) on “Jerusalem” (Christian doc-trine), and had argued that Christian theology should be purified of paganand platonic influences so as to get back to the original biblical revelation.But as the later development of anti-apologeticism would demonstrate,the vulnerable point in this argument was that it ultimately underminedChristian theologyas such: as historians became ever more adept at recog-nizing traces of pagan philosophy in Christian doctrine, it was beginningto dawn on them how little of it was free from such influence, and howdifficult (or rather, impossible) it was to do without it, and build a theo-logical system on the Bible alone. The profound irony was that the logic ofanti-apologeticism therefore ended up undermining the orthodoxy that ithad set out to defend, while greatly strengthening the pietist argument thatthe Bible was all about practical piety and not about theological doctrine.also Arnold,Erste Liebe. Arnold’sHistorie und Beschreibung der Mystischen Theologie(1703)canbe considered his response to the methodology of the anti-apologetic school (see analysis inLehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,297–307).160Tertullian,De praescriptione haereticorumchapter7.7–9(Schleyer ed.,244)."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"122The history of errorIn short: wielding the ever-sharpening weapon of patristic criticism, theorthodox anti-apologists had been busy cutting off the branch on whichthey were themselves sitting.161Gottfried Arnold seems to have understood this, and his approach tohistoriography shows how pietists could turn the anti-apologetic argumentto their own advantage. Contrary to K ̈opke and Zierold, Arnold refused toeven discuss questions concerning the historical relation between pagan-ism and Christianity because, in his view,there could be no such relation.“Athens” and “Jerusalem,” or philosophy and faith, are not just incompat-ible but whollyincommensurable: they share no common measure that isapplicable to both, and therefore no discussion is even possible.162Chris-tian faith is sufficient to itself, and has no need of entering the arenaof philosophical dispute. According to Arnold, the tragedy of the ortho-dox polemicists was that, while claiming to offer a cure for the disease ofheresy, they were themselves symptomatic of that disease: as shown by theiraddiction to doctrinal quarreling, not only had they entered the arena ofphilosophy, but they had been thoroughly perverted by it. One might saythat they had become “Athenians” without realizing it. They believed thatthe battle between orthodoxy and heresy should take place in the arenaof theology, but failed to realize that only “Athens” has such arenas; theywished to purify Christian theology from pagan contamination, but wereblind to the fact that their own theology was a product of such contamina-tion. Whereas all the discussions we have been surveying so far had beenstructured according to the polarity between “biblical faith” and “paganphilosophy,” Arnold changed the rules of the game by building his historyupon a different polarity: that between “Christian piety” and “doctrinaltheology.” As a result, paganism ceased being a factor of any importancein his narrative.The nature of the “paradigm shift” represented by Arnold’sImpartialHistoryis important but subtle, and can easily be misunderstood. From theabove, one might be tempted to conclude that since the patristic apologists161See above, page103, and note96. Lehmann-Brauns explains how “precarious” the situation oforthodox Protestantism had become on the eve of the Enlightenment: “it rejected Pietist attemptsat an intensified piety as an un-biblical paganization of Christianity, and denounced allegory,while at the same time basing itself upon a dogmatism whose biblical legitimacy had long come tobe doubted. The rigorous orthodox Biblicist lost philosophical exegesis of Christianity to paganphilosophy and its heretical successors. Living piety had to be conceded to the Pietists, who shouldbe kept distinct from those platonic-philosophical heretics. All that remained was the bible, andwhat came next was radical biblical criticism.”162Van Dongen,Geen gemene maat,173(summary in English).

But this would bemissing the whole point about Arnold’s oeuvre, which is replete withpositive references to all the early Fathers. Rejecting the patristic apologistsmerely for their involvement with platonism would imply that criteria fordistinguishing between true Christianity and heresy could be found on thelevel of verbal doctrine (whether one calls it philosophical or theological) –but this would be precisely the “Athenian” error that Arnold was criticizing.The only true criterion, for Arnold, is whether an author’s works exemplifythe spirit of humble faith and practical piety that is the mark of the trueChristian. As long as they do, it does not matter whether or not they havebeen meddling in philosophy, for their heart is in “Jerusalem.”Arnold’s point of reference for true Christianity was the original apos-tolic community, which he painted in highly idyllic terms: its members hadbeen all about pure faith, love, unity, peace, and pious practice. The centralcore of this true Christianity of humble piety had consisted in direct innerillumination and the experience of spiritual rebirth in Christ through theHoly Spirit.163But very soon, this pure spiritual community had fallen intosin: faith degenerated into dogmatism, communal love gave way to self-love, and inner peace and unity were broken by external strife and sectariandisputes. The Inner Church of the spirit degenerated into an ecclesiasti-cal institution focused on power and domination, sadly culminating inthe religious politics of Constantine. From then on, theVerfallsgeschichteof Christianity164had continued with depressing repetitiveness up to thepresent (discussed by Arnold in seventeen books, one for each century, likeBaronius’Annalsand the “Magdeburg Centuries” before him). Luther’sReformation was no exception to the spectacle of decline, for it had degen-erated quite as disastrously as the Roman Catholic Church, leading to theunsavory spectacle, in Arnold’s own time, of theologians fighting like catsand dogs over who was “orthodox” and who were the “heretics.”These polemicists did not behave as Christians should, and had clearlyforgotten what the gospel was supposed to be all about. If Arnold calledhis history “impartial,” this certainly did not imply an attitude of “dis-interested” neutrality on his part, let alone a position of methodologicalagnosticism as we might understand it today. On the contrary, he clearlytook a position:163See, for example, Schl ̈ogl, “Hermetismus als Sprache der ‘unsichtbaren Kirche’,”173–174;Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,267–272.164For example, Baur,Epochen,90; Meinhold,Geschichte der kirchlichen Historiographie,vol.i,430–431; Buchholz, “Historia Contentionis,”171–172; Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,288."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"124The history of errorso we raise a powerful protest against all those who have a taste for quarreling[welche lust zu zancken haben] and who would like to pick a fight about thisor that doctrinal point . . . considering that the entire History demonstrates howmuch malice, error, excess and destruction has come out of such wars about words[wortkriegen]...the whole world is still filled with entire armies of scholars whobusy themselves with such destructive battles and are lying in ambush against oneanother.165The schoolmen and worldly theologians have obscured the “clear waters”of the Christian faith with their intellectual games and doctrinal quibbling:while the Church of Christ should live in peace and unity, they have turnedit into a filthy “cesspool” (Mist-Pf ̈utze) of quarreling, slandering, violence,and vain ambition.166Arnold could claim to write from a position “above the parties” because,in his opinion, the distinction between true and false had nothing to dowith doctrinal matters at all. As a result, the historian was entirely free tosearch for “true Christians” regardless of their doctrinal positions, that isto say, among the so-called heretics as well as among the orthodox. In anera dominated by confessional strife, this principle seemed tolerant andnon-dogmatic, and it has earned Arnold a positive reputation among earlyEnlightenment thinkers, beginning with (interestingly) Jacob Thomasius’son Christian.167But as already suggested, Arnold’s “impartiality” did notimply neutrality, for in fact his church history amounted to a simplereversal: the “orthodox” emerged from his History as the real heretics,and the “heretics” as the true Christians. It is important to understandthat this happened not merely because of Arnold’s personal biases, butbecause his claim of impartiality was self-defeating to begin with: in termsof the underlying theory of decline, the orthodoxy that was supposed tobe treated “impartially” was already marked as heretical by virtue of beinginstitutional and doctrinal.Against the depressing spectacle of historical Christianity and its endlessdoctrinal disputes, Arnold posited a supra-historical principle of immediatereligious experience, grounded in Sophianic wisdom:But what this principal work of wisdom really is, can better be experienced thandescribed, and may be indicated here only insofar as God reveals it in the soul,outside and beyond which it behooves one to be silent . . .

Because of the focus onwisdom rather than words, the term “theosophia” is more appropriate than“theologia.”170Obviously, all this was yet another variation on the pervasivetheme of “inwardness” which had been criticized by the anti-apologists asa form of gnosis; and as the above quotation demonstrates, Arnold saw noproblem in referring even to Hermes (quoting indirectly from Lactantius)in support of what he saw as the core and essence of Christian spirituality.It is particularly important to understand the implications of Arnold’sperspective concerning the logic of historical criticism, and historiographyas such. His approach to history rested upon methodological premisesthat were wholly incompatible with those of the anti-apologists; and fromthis perspective, the arguments of theseCritici, as he called them, weremisguided and irrelevant.

His only concern was with “true” Christianity as he sawit, not with Christianity as a historical phenomenon that emerges in closeinteraction and exchange with its cultural environment. Because the gospelhad made paganism obsolete, pagan traditions were irrelevant to the historyof churches and heretics. As shown by the reference to Hermes, Arnolddid not exclude the possibility that ancient sages might occasionally havesaid something true; but again, simply because philosophy is pagan andnot Christian, it is of no concern to a historian of Christianity.While all the approaches we have been discussing so far could be seenas rudimentary exercises in the comparative history of religions, Arnold’sleading principles were in fact incompatible with historiography proper:they rested on a pure essentialism that ruled out any historical comparisonfrom the outset. HisImpartial Historypresents the reader with a remarkablyde-contextualized description of the supposedly “real” and “pure” Christianfaith and its many degenerations, which never result from pagan influence –or from any other historical influence, for that matter – but are explainedexclusively from sinful human tendencies such as pride, egoism, or thepursuit of power.173Arnold’s approach to the history of Christianity may be described asa more specific development of the “history of truth” approach. It isgrounded in the same paradox as its Renaissance ancestors – it tries towrite the history of something that cannot have a history, because it isconsidered beyond change and development – but is considerably moreradical in its insistence on direct “inner” spiritual experience or gnosisas the only reliable means of access to the one universal truth, which isnow sharply juxtaposed against any “external” and therefore (from this172Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,297,306.

Up to this moment, there had been essentially two positionsin the debate: one that defended some sort of accommodation betweenpagan philosophy and Christian theology (from the patristic apologists tohumanists in the tradition of Ficino, Pico, Steuco, or Patrizi, and from thereallthewayuptopietistslikeK ̈opke and Zierold) and another one thatrejected any such accommodation and insisted on keeping Christian truthsharply apart from pagan error (beginning with anti-apologetic Fathers likeTertullian, and from Renaissance authors like the younger Pico or Crispo174In the modern study of religion, the term “religionism” has come to be used for the methodologicalcounterpart of social-scientific “reductionism.” Associated in particular with the so-called “Chicagoschool” dominated by the legacy of Mircea Eliade, religionism insists that religion is an irreduciblephenomenonsui generiswhich cannot be explained in terms external to it, such as, for example,sociology or psychology (for a very readable introduction to the religionism–reductionism debate,see Allen, “Is nothing Sacred?”; for a more theoretical discussion focused on Western esotericism,see Hanegraaff, “Empirical Method”). See further discussion inChapter4."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"128The history of errorall the way up to Thomasius Sr. and Colberg). The ancient wisdom dis-course of the early modern period was constituted by the complex dialecticsbetween these two opposed positions.But to account for developments from the end of the seventeenth centuryon, this framework ceases to be sufficient. The “religionist” paradigmpioneered by Arnold escaped from the traditional terms of oppositionby declaring paganism irrelevant to the history of Christianity, while atthe same time creating a new conceptual foundation (the centrality ofinner spiritual experience) for defending the legitimacy of the “heretical”tradition. Moreover, still in the final decades of the seventeenth century,there emerged a second alternative paradigm as well, to which we willnow turn. This one proclaimed not just the irrelevance, but the futility andeven the foolishness of paganism, denouncing it as superstitious “prejudice”in the name of Reason and finally delegating it to the dustbin of history.This perspective became dominant in the age of the Enlightenment, andwould come to exert a powerful influence over how “Western esotericism”has been perceived up to the present day.From the perspective of my discussion so far, the Enlightenment his-toriography of “ancient wisdom” may be considered the closing chapterin the history of anti-apologeticism. We have seen that Jacob Thom-asius had sought to define the nature of true Christianity as incompatiblewith anything pagan; but his more famous son Christian used his father’scritical tools rather to liberate the history of philosophy from its theo-logical dependencies and turn it into an autonomous discipline.175It wasnot so much that pagan philosophies had to be wholly rejected, but thatthey must be recognized for what they were: attempts to understand theworld by purely human means, without the aid of Revelation. Such anapproach has, of course, become constitutive of the history of philosophyas a modern discipline; but necessary and inevitable though this processof academic emancipation may have been, we will see that it came at aprice.Christian Thomasius is traditionally seen as the “Father of the GermanAufkl ̈arung,” and not without good reason. Nevertheless, his case showshow reductive such labels can be: his strong Enlightenment commitmentsdid not keep him from receiving a strong influence of pietism and theChristian theosophy of Jacob B ̈ohme and Pierre Poiret, even to the point175The literature on the younger Thomasius is extensive. For his role in the history of the history ofphilosophy, see Longo, “Storia della filosofia tra eclettismo e pietismo,”341–350; for his relationto the anti-apologeticism of his father, the indispensable discussion remains Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,308–354."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Enlightenment and eclipse129of having his own experience of “illumination” in1693, and developing aNaturphilosophieexplicitly along Platonic-Hermetic lines in hisVersuch vonWesen des Geistes(1699).176As regards the history of philosophy, Thomasiusinherited his father’s dislike for syncretic mixtures of theology and philos-ophy; but he went far beyond him in defending the ideal of a practicaland useful philosophy wholly free of metaphysics177and, indeed, of anynon-rational “prejudice” (Vorurteil) – a term that was understood by himas strongly overlapping with “superstition” (Aberglaube).178This programimplied the need for a critical revision of the entire history of philosophyas traditionally understood, for as Thomasius put it, “man will never befreed from prejudices, unless with the help of history he understands theorigin of prejudices.”179The method for doing so came to be known as“eclecticism.” Using his own faculty of rational judgment, the historian ofphilosophy should seek to separate the wheat from the chaff, accepting truetenets wherever he might find them while rejecting false ones, instead ofdogmatically following the claims of one particular philosophical “sect.”180Against the notion ofphilosophia sectaria, with its wholesale obedienceto the tenets of this or that philosophical school, Thomasius’philosophiaeclecticaexhorted the historian to “think for himself ” instead of blindlyfollowing some traditional authority.This method of eclecticism was a clear alternative to sectarian dogma-tism, and would become central to the historiography of philosophy as itdeveloped during the eighteenth century; but it may also serve to illustratehow complex the relationship is between the early German Enlightenmentand pietism. Although his criterion of selection was very different, Gott-fried Arnold’s “impartiality” was a reflection of the same eclectic principle:the historian of Christianity should disregard sectarian prejudice, so as to“investigate everything and keep what is good” (1Thess.5:21). Far frombeing a concern of strict Enlightenment ideologues alone, then, the “praiseof eclecticism” in fact became a central aspect of popular philosophy during176Meumann, “Diskursive Formationen,”78–83(analyzing the attempts by earlier scholars to “pro-tect” Thomasius’ Enlightenment identity by downplaying the embarrassing theosophical/pietistdimensions of his life and work); Kemper,Gottebenbildlichkeit,244–257.177Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,312: “For Christian . . . the history of the mingling of philosophyand theology was the dark background against which the light of his philosophy liberated frommetaphysics should shine in all the brilliance of its practical usefulness.”178Schneiders,Aufkl ̈arung und Vorurteilskritik, esp.92–115on Thomasius.179Thomasius,Cautelae§53(p.94).180On the difference with earlier understandings of eclecticism, see Albrecht, “Thomasius”; Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,313–317; Schmidt-Biggemann,Theodizee und Tatsachen,203–222.Anextensivereference work for eclecticism in all its historical forms is Albrecht,Eklektik(see pp.398–416forChristian Thomasius)."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"130The history of errorthe eighteenth century.181It is one of the ironies of history that precisely thiseclectic method in historical research was praised in a famous passage byLeibniz under a title which, against the background of our previous discus-sions, could not have been more badly chosen: that ofphilosophia perennis!The truth is more widely spread than one might think, but very often it is blurred,and very often also enveloped, even enfeebled, mutilated, corrupted, by additionsthat spoil it or render it less useful. By calling attention to these traces of truthin the ancients (or, to speak more generally, in our predecessors) one would belifting the gold from out of the mud, the diamond from its mine, and the lightfrom the shadows; and in fact, that would be a kind of perennial philosophy(perennis quaedam philosophia).182So great was Leibniz’s authority among later generations, and so completewas the eclipse of the ancient wisdom narrative after the period of theEnlightenment, that this evident confusion betweenphilosophia perennisand Enlightenment eclecticism would become normative among philoso-phers for over two and a half centuries, until Charles B. Schmitt revivedthe memory of the original Renaissance perspective in his seminal articleof1966.183The implications of Enlightenment eclecticism for the history of phi-losophy are presented with particular clarity in the writings of ChristophAugust Heumann (1681–1764), “the Thomasius of G ̈ottingen,”184who iswidely considered the founder of the history of philosophy as a modern181Zimmermann,Weltbild des jungen Goethe,vol.i,19–27.182Leibniz, letter to Remond (August26,1714), in: Gerhardt,Philosophischen Schriften von GottfriedWilhelm Leibniz,iii,624–625. Leibniz continues by noting that “the orientals had beautiful andgreat ideas about the Divinity,” the Greeks added reasoning and “a form of science,” the Fathers ofthe Church did away with “what was bad in Greek philosophy,” and the scholastics tried to make“what was passable in the philosophy of the pagans” useful for Christianity, which is why Leibnizhas often said that some gold can be found even in the “dung” of scholastic barbarianism (ibid.,625).183Schmitt, “Perennial Philosophy.” Schmitt was clearly mistaken in seeing the Leibniz quotationas representative of “the tradition of perennial philosophy as envisioned by Steuco” (ibid.,530),as my discussion inChapter1has hopefully demonstrated.

It is certainly true that theeclectic method allowed eighteenth-century thinkers to investigate “Platonic-Hermetic” traditionsin search of the truths they might contain (and this is more than sufficient to explain the examplesgiven by Zimmermann); but by no means does this imply that eclecticism is itself a manifesta-tion of perennial philosophy, or that the latter is inherently eclectic.

After working for many years as a Gymnasiumteacher and administrator, in1734he was appointed at the new Universityof G ̈ottingen, but his historical-critical methods and their implicationskept creating controversy, culminating in a conflict with the university thatforced him into early retirement. He has left a very large and impressiveoeuvre, but most important for our concerns are hisActa Philosophorum,history’s first periodical devoted to the history of philosophy, that appearedfrom1715to1727and was filled mostly by Heumann himself. The secondvolume contained a long treatise “Von denen Kennzeichen der falschenund un ̈achten Philosophie,” in which Heumann discussed six characteris-tics which allow us to distinguish “false and bogus” from “real” philosophy.(1) Pseudo-philosophy has a preference foruseless speculation.Examplesarescholastic metaphysics, the Lullian philosophy (which should better becalled “Nullian”), Leibniz’sArs Combinatoria, and a whole range ofdivinatory systems: “thears onirocritica,thears chiromantica,thearsgeomantica,thears astrologia,inoneword:alltheartes divinatoriae,which are nothing else but pagan miscarriages.”186(2) Pseudo-philosophy appeals merely tohuman authority. Here,Heumann’s target is thephilosophia sectaria, which from all the philoso-phers chooses to follow only one, thereby accepting his errors alongwith his true insights and treating him as if he were a god (“for aman without errors is not a man but a god”), while dismissing allother philosophers as if they were “dumb asses.” A true philosophershould not appeal to vain authorities, but to clear evidence [Beweis-Gr ̈unde];187and this allows him to eclectically sift truth from error inany philosophical school.(3) Even worse is the appeal toTraditioninstead of reason. Here,Heumann’s prime target turns out to be theprisca theologia,ormorespecifically what we have been referring to as “Platonic Orientalism”:Thus I also consider Plato’s philosophy to be false in many respects, becauseagain and again he appeals to thetraditiones veterum, to which belongs hisentireDaemonologia, which should not therefore be considered a part of theplatonic Wisdom, but of platonic foolishness. For the same reason I mustdeny the title of true wisdom to the Jewish Cabala . . . For even though it185Braun,Histoire de l’histoire de la philosophie,100–119; Longo, “La teoria della ‘historia philosoph-ica’,”437–476;M ̈uhlpfordt, “Ein kryptoradikaler Thomasianer,”306; Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,355–399.186Heumann, “Von denen Kennzeichen,”190.187Ibid.,192–193."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"132The history of errormight contain some truth or another, we have no way of distinguishing thetrue from the false.188(4) Heumann’s longest discussion by far is devoted to the fourth char-acteristic: the syncretism of philosophy withsuperstition,thatistosay, with “irrational religion” [ein unvern ̈unfftiger Gottesdienst]. Thetrue religion of Christianity is perfectly compatible with reason, andthus with philosophy: “wherever the true divine revelation is, philos-ophy finds a secure shelter.”189In contrast, the false religion known assuperstition – Heumann never bothers to define the term, but evidentlyconsiders it equivalent to paganism – fears philosophy as its deadliestenemy, and cannot possibly live in its vicinity. The two are mutuallyexclusive: “Superstition is foolishness, and can tolerate wisdom as littleas darkness tolerates the light.” It is born from ignorance, and leads to“absurd teachings” and “horrible acts.”190Finally, Heumann addressesthe enemy directly, in its concrete historical manifestation, in a passagethat announces the final expulsion of the “philosophia barbarica” fromthe citadel of academic philosophy:From what has been said thus far, it clearly follows that the philosophyby which the papists were driven into paganism, and which is known asphilosophiam barbaricam, is necessarily a false and fake philosophy. So adieu,dearPhilosophia Chaldaeorum,Persarum,Aegyptiorum, &c, that one usuallymakes such a fuss about, out of blind veneration of Antiquity. [Heumannnow refers to Michael Maier’s and Morhof ’s references to secret philosophicalschoolsinantiquity,andcontinues:]...IamcertainthatalltheseCollegia sac-erdotum Aegyptiorum,Orphaicorum,Eumolpidarum,Samothracum,Magorum,Brachmanum,GymnosophistarumandDruidum, which Morhof sometimescallsocculta,thenagainarcana,orsecretaandsecretiora...that all of thesewere schools, not of Wisdom, but of foolishness [Thorheit], which attemptedto bringsuperstitio in formam artis[i.e. to make superstition into anars,orart]and sought to draw profit from deceiving the people...So nobody shouldhold it against me if I have not the slightest respect for all thoseCollegiaphilosophica secreta, but judge that the passing of time has quite rightly madea secret of these mysteries, by dumping them into the sea of oblivion; andthat even if the writings of thesephilosophorum barbarorumwere preserved188Ibid.,200–201.189Ibid.,204.

Continuing his dis-cussion of superstition, Heumann makes a sharp distinction betweenthe barbarian nations drenched in superstition, and Greece as the homeand origin of true philosophy. In discussing the Greek philosophers,he makes a point of attacking the common reference to them as “wisepagans” or “pagan philosophers.” A pagan (ein Heyde) is defined asa man who is “wholly drenched in superstition, and who worshipsgods of gold and wood.”192But the true philosophers were no idol-aters, on the contrary: their religion was a reasonabletheologia nat-uralis, and therefore they are best referred to as “naturalists.”193Butafter antiquity “it was over again with philosophy,” as the “gruesomePapacy” (das greuliche Pabsttum) and the monks caused humanity tosink into a new age of barbarian superstition.194Only with Erasmusand the Reformation did it become possible for philosophy to reviveagain.(5) Heumann’s fifth characteristic of pseudo-philosophy is its prefer-ence for obscure and enigmatic language and symbolism. Whereasphilosophy should bring enlightenment, by the so-called “symbolicphilosophy” one is led from darkness to darkness. As examples,Heumann refers to the kabbalah (to which he devotes a special191Ibid.,209–211. Cf. Heumann, “Von der Barbarey,” where he splits up “religious barbarism” into“pagan barbarism” (consisting in “tasteless ceremonies, veneration of lifeless creatures, and otherirrational and godless things”), “mohammedan barbarism,” and “papist barbarism.” We have beenliberated from all this by Luther, the “greatAntibarbarum”(ibid.,229–230).192Heumann, “Von denen Kennzeichen,”215–216.193Ibid.,217. But note that there are two kinds: “blind pagans” may become naturalists whenphilosophy opens their eyes and frees them from idolatry, but if Christians become naturaliststhey fall from light into darkness, imagining against reason that the Christian religion is no betterthan paganism. Thus the implicit hierarchy is clear: philosophy is higher than paganism, butChristianity is higher than philosophy.194Ibid.,220–221. See also Heumann, “Von dem Namen der Welt-Weißheit,”317–318,ontheroleplayed by the Fathers of the Church: “I am convinced, and can prove it with examples, that fromamong those who went over from the Lutherans to the Papist Church, and did so seriously andwithout hypocrisy, most were induced to this by industrious reading of thePatres. For in thismanner they have learned that the errors of the Papists have a much better foundation in thelatter’s writings than in our doctrines. Therefore it is quite good that most of our learned men,including the clergy, do not know thePatresbetter . . . ” And cf.ibid.,318–320, for examples ofHeumann’s utter lack of respect even for Augustine."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"134The history of errordiscussion in his next treatise),195alchemy, the “hieroglyphian phi-losophy,” Pythagoreanism, and even the Chinese I Ching.196(6) The final characteristic of pseudo-philosophy is its immorality. HereHeumann makes a point of arguing that the human will is subservientto the intellect (das Verstand): only by training and improving man’sintellect is it possible to bring evil impulses under control. By doing so,the human will comes to be ruled by the “three fundamental articles”of all true philosophy: that there is one God, who is the origin of allbeings;thattheworldstandsunderGod’sprovidentialrule;andthatthe human soul is immortal.197In juxtaposing these principles againstthe “fundamental errors” which lead to false philosophy, Heumannshows himself a faithful heir of Thomasius father and son (who arequoted continually throughout the treatise): these errors are the beliefthat the world is co-eternal with God, that the human soul is material,and that matter is capable of thinking and acting out of itself.198Having dispensed with pseudo-philosophy, Heumann proceeded to sketchthe history of real philosophy in an essay titled “Von dem Ursprung undWachstum der Philosophie.” Evidently to find a compromise between hisProtestant and Enlightenment commitments, he distinguished betweentwo types of wisdom, a “plain and simple” and a “learned and thorough”one, tracing the former back to Abraham, and the latter to the Greeks.But in order to show the superiority of both, he had to demarcate themclearly from their counterparts: foolishness (Thorheit) in its “simple” andits “learned” forms. Foolishness or stupidity (stultitia) just being what itis, he disposed of the former quite quickly; but he needed more spaceto demonstrate that the so-called scientific achievements of the ancientcivilizations were “foolishness” in spite of their learned and erudite nature:[The pagans] began to study, and their minds that were loaded with evil impulsesthey began to exercise in all kinds of sciences. But because their will was pervertedin its foundation, this resulted in sciences that were partly vain and useless, partlyfalse and unfounded. [They devoted themselves to answering] useless questionsinspired by mere curiosity, through which they created the illusion of great wisdom.Partly they concentrated their curiosity on studying natural causes, partly on thearts of divination.199Pagan learning was fed from three sources: practical necessity, curiosity,and superstition. The first one was quite straightforward (for example,195Heumann, “Von denen vier Cabbalistischen Welten.”196Heumann, “Von denen Kennzeichen,”227–228.197The last is expanded further in Heumann, “Von dem Ursprung und Wachstum,”251–252.198Ibid.,235–236.199Heumann, “Von dem Ursprung und Wachstum,”268–269."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Enlightenment and eclipse135the Egyptians had to develop geometry in order to contain the floodingof the Nile, the Chaldaeans studied astronomy in view of agriculture),and Heumann treated the second one in a quite neutral manner as well;but having come to the third source, superstition, he again gave free reinto his contempt, mentioning such examples of divination as oniromancy,haruspicy, auguries, and astrology. In spite of the obvious foolishness ofsuch arts, Heumann admits that the sciences were developed in countrieslike Egypt earlier than in Greece, and even that the Egyptians were thefirst to philosophize “about physics and other curious sciences”; and healso conceded that the Greeks sent their sons to study in such countries.But nevertheless, Diogenes Laertius was right that only in Greece wasphilosophy developed into its true form: this was the case for logic, moralphilosophy, and even physics, for “from their travels to Egypt and othercountries, Thales, Democritus and others brought home so little naturalwisdom that they had to start all over again from the beginning, anddiscover theprincipiathemselves.”200The so-called “barbarian philosophy”does not deserve that name, for its goal is not wisdom but idolatry.201Throughout his treatise, Heumann used metaphors of growth and devel-opment to describe how – far from having declined from some originalstate of perfection – philosophy had progressed through the three stages ofearly childhood, adolescence, and full maturity:202so we must describe the origins of philosophy by means of stages, as follows.With the ancient Hebrews we find the origin (admittedly not of philosophy, butnevertheless) of plain and simple wisdom. In Chaldaea and Egypt, but particularlyin the latter environment, not only the arts, but also studying (but not thestudiumphilosophicum) were practiced and cultivated. The Greeks were the first to spreadthe wings of their understanding [Verstand] upwards, and start to philosophize: atfirst onlyparticulariter, but eventually alsosystematice, and finally evenuniversaliterandsystematiceat the same time, or in one word,pansophice. From the Greeks,philosophy was passed on to the Christians, who, because they also have a perfectlypure religion as well as a divine revelation, could surpass in wisdom even the mostlearned of the GreekPhilosophos.203As for the relation between philosophy and Christianity, Heumann endedwith a quotation from Arnold Geulinx: “What we understand from DivineRevelation, and would not have understood without it, we afterwards alsounderstand through reason – and even so clearly that we imagine we couldhave understood this truth through the light of reason alone.”204200Ibid.,287.201Ibid.,289.202Explicitly stated inibid.,293.203Ibid.,290.204Ibid.,291."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"136The history of errorThe “Enlightenment paradigm” announced so clearly in Heumann’sActa Philosophorumwas the beginning of the eclipse of “Western esoteri-cism” in modern intellectual discourse. So far, the “pagan” philosophiesassociated with Platonic Orientalism had always been considered seriousplayers in the philosophical arena; and this had happened because eventheir most outspoken opponents could not deny that they were part of thetraditional canon of some of the most ancient and venerable philosophicalschools or “sects,” the platonic one in particular. But the eclectic methodchanged the rules of the game entirely: it denied any established traditionthe right to decide what was and what was not to be considered “phi-losophy” in the first place, and handed that authority over to the humanfaculty of rational judgment. Strongly amplified by two centuries of Protes-tant opposition against the Roman Catholic claim of representing “the”only universal tradition of wisdom, Enlightenment historiography specifi-cally targeted the ancient wisdom narrative and everything that had cometo be associated with it, such as the appeal to ancient oriental paganismsand initiatory schools, divinatory systems, demonologies, the kabbalah,the “occult mysteries” claimed by symbolic theology, and the “enthusiasticphilosophy” known as theosophy.205ForanauthorlikeColberg,allthishad still been part of the dangerous heretical stream of “Platonic-HermeticChristianity,” but in Heumann’s eyes they had lost even the dignity ofa serious opponent. He was laughing in their face while waving themgoodbye: “adieu, dearPhilosophia Chaldaeorum,Persarum,Aegyptiorum,&c...”Thus the foundations were established not only for the disappearanceof most references to “Western esotericism” in textbooks of history of phi-losophy, but also for a new genre of Enlightenment literature intendedfor “learning and entertainment”: that of “histories of stupidity.”206Chris-tian Thomasius himself published aGeschichte der Weißheit und Thorheit(also published in Latin asHistoria sapientiae et stultitiae)in1693,but205On this last current, see Heumann, “Von dem Ursprung und Wachsthum,”312.206At its ultimate extremity, this perspective could lead philosophers to deny any significance to historyas such, as exemplified in the twentieth century by A. J. Ayer’s characterization of Bertrand Russell’swell-known history of philosophy as “a brief introduction to the history of human stupidity” (Ayer,Part of my Life,183; and see the more general discussion of anti-historical philosophical perspectivesin Hankins, “Renaissance Philosophy between God and the Devil,”591ff.). Essentially, we aredealing again with the basic paradox of a “history of truth,” but now from a rationalist perspective:as clearly formulated already by Hegel, “The object of philosophy is the unchangeable, eternaltruth as it exists in and for itself. History, however, narrates what existed at one time, but thendisappeared and was replaced by something else; thus philosophy cannot have a history, and inhistory philosophy cannot exist” (Werke,vol.xiii,19, as quoted in Freyer,Geschichte der Geschichteder Philosophie,7)."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The historian: Jacob Brucker137the most famous example is certainly Johann Christoph Adelung’s seven-volumeGeschichte der menschlichen Narrheit, published at the height ofthe Enlightenment, in1785–1789.

Reading the accounts of his life,one can only be amazed at his extreme productivity: during his career hepublished about20,000pages on the history of philosophy,211and whilehiswritingsmadehimfamous,theywereallwrittenalongsidehisverybusywork as a pastor in the Evangelical Church, where in some periods of hislife he had to give sermons twice or three times a week and teach Latin foreight hours each day, while also visiting the sick, leading funerals, doingadministrative work, and looking after his gravely ill wife.212According to acontemporary biographer, his herculean labors on the history of philosophywere at least partly therapeutic: in addition to a weak physical constitution,Brucker suffered from heavy attacks of “melancholy,” and only by studyingvery hard could he distract himself from his fears and depressions.213Themanner of Brucker’s death in1770could not have been more symbolicfor this archetypicalStubengelehrterand exemplary representative of theProtestant work-ethic: he fell in his study, having tried to lift a heavyvolume from an upper shelf.209The episode is described in a biography of Heumann (1768) by Georg Andreas Cassius, quotedand discussed in Longo, “Geistige Anregungen und Quellen,”175–176with n.34.210Von Stetten, “Jacob Brucker,”295, quoted in Stammen, “Jacob Brucker,”82.211Braun,Histoire de l’histoire de la philosophie,120.212Behler, “Eine unbeachtete Biographie,”42.213Ibid.,42–43."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The historian: Jacob Brucker139Most of those20,000pages produced by Brucker during his lifetimebelonged to his multi-volume history of philosophy, published in Germanfrom1731to1736, and its strongly revised Latin version first published from1742to1744and again in a further expanded edition from1766to1767.214The German version is titledKurze Fragen aus der Philosophischen Historie:it seeks to cover the entire history of thought from before the Flood untilthe present day, and does so in a question-and-answer format. The title isdeceptive, for while the questions may be short enough, the answers areoften extremely lengthy; and increasingly from one volume to the next,everything Brucker cannot put in his main chapters he puts in his notes,which are printed in small letters and often turn into minor monographs oftheir own, with incredibly detailed references and bibliographies. Nothinglike this had existed before. In response to the increasing demand for aLatin version accessible to a non-German readership, Brucker decided torewrite the entire history anew, and in even greater detail – but with fewerfootnotes – and the result was hisHistoria critica philosophiae, which isnow generally consideredthemonument of the history of philosophy inthe eighteenth century.The importance of this work can hardly be overestimated. It became theindispensable reference for the history of philosophy not only in Germany,but over the whole of Europe, throughout the eighteenth and even far intothe nineteenth century. Of particular importance is its relation to two otherfamous and extremely influential reference works: the so-calledgroße Zedler,and Diderot’sEncyclop ́edie.

For its many entries on the history ofphilosophy, Brucker was againthedecisive source: Diderot in fact plunderedtheHistoria critica philosophiaewithout any scruples, while taking care toturn the heavy and serious prose of the German Protestant minister intoelegant French. His editorial work has been described as a “masterwork ofadaptation and subtle deception: by a few interventions, Diderot artfullychange[d] . . . the serious chapters of theHistoria criticainto a gracefulreading full of allusions anddouble entendres, which were excellently suitedto theesprit philosophique.”217If we take into account the well-knowncentrality of theEncyclop ́edieto the French Enlightenment, the centralityof “philosophy” to Diderot’s project, and the paradigmatic role of theFrenchphilosophesin defining internationally what the Enlightenment wassupposed to be all about, one understands the conclusion that was drawnby Lucien Braun in his standard work on the history of the history ofphilosophy:In the second half of the eighteenth century there appear a whole series of worksthat are based exclusively on theHistoria critica; and in that regard, there is nothingin the domain of the history of philosophy that can be compared to this work.It is the monument to which all the Enlightened spirits in Europe referred at thetime . . . The eighteenth century is dominated by Brucker: he is the only point ofreference here.218What, then, do we find in Brucker’sMagnum Opus, and what is it thatmakes him such a crucial author for the history of the study of Westernesotericism? Following the basic principle of Enlightenment eclecticism inthe tradition of Christian Thomasius and Heumann, Brucker undertookthe task of surveying the entire history of human thought with the aimof separating the philosophical “wheat” from the pseudo-philosophical“chaff.” Hence he did not at all restrict himself to what had been definedas “real” philosophy by Heumann; rather,allforms of pagan philosophy aswell as Christian–pagan syncretism were studied and discussed by him inmeticulous detail, with the goal of demonstrating in each and every casewhether it was based on reason or on superstition. As a result, Brucker’sKurze FragenandHistoria criticaboth consist of two interwoven strands,referred to by him as “philosophia eclectica” and “philosophia sectaria”: thefirst one traces the history of philosophy from its earliest beginnings, and217Piaia, “Jacob Bruckers Wirkungsgeschichte,”230. For Diderot’s dependence on Brucker, see Fabre,“Diderot et les th ́eosophes”; Jehl, “Jacob Brucker und die ‘Encyclop ́edie’.”218Braun, here quoted from the German edition by Jehl, “Jacob Brucker und die ‘Encyclop ́edie’,”241."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The historian: Jacob Brucker141the second traces the history of its polemical “Other.”219This presentationbecame the normative one for intellectuals throughout the eighteenthcentury and far into the nineteenth, and was fundamental to how theEnlightenment came to define its very identity.What, then, are the main outlines of how Brucker describes the his-tory of philosophy’s shadow? Quite similar to Heumann’s, all his work ismarked by the peculiar combination of Protestant biblicism and rationalcriticism. For Brucker, the truth of the biblical revelation is a matter offaith beyond rational demonstration; but in evaluating historical materi-als, he thinks and argues entirely as an Enlightenment critic. The historyof thought is approached as a history of human opinions, which maybe either right or wrong; and like his predecessors, Brucker thinks ofthem as “systems” of thought that can be described in terms of a limitednumber of basic doctrinal propositions.220With respect to all kinds ofpious traditions and ideas concerning ancient wisdom, Brucker typicallybegins by giving an overview of the arguments that are being adduced,then examines the available evidence, and finally decides whether or notit is reasonable to maintain those beliefs. He argues essentially the wayacademic historiography still argues today, albeit with a strong normativeagenda.Heumann had used theological criteria to divide the history of philos-ophy into three main periods: the great caesuras for him were the birthof Christ and the advent of the Reformation.221Brucker’s subdivisionwas roughly similar, but used a non-theological nomenclature: the greatturning-points were now described as the beginning of the Roman Empireand the “restoration of letters” in the late Middle Ages and early Renais-sance. Through all these periods he traced the history of the “philosophicasectaria.” In the first period, the central place in that regard is taken bythe Chaldaean/Zoroastrian and the Egyptian system, next to the birth anddevelopment of true philosophy among the Greeks. The second period isdominated, at least for our concerns, by two great systems: Neoplatonismand Kabbalah. In the third period, finally, both of these systems are revivedand combined during the Renaissance, and against their background thereemerges yet a third relatively autonomous system of sectarianism, that ofTheosophy. Although Brucker clearly distinguishes these various “systems”and treats them separately, his discussion shows that they are essentiallybranches of one and the same great tree of pagan superstition.219Cf.

Again, we see here the lingering influence ofJacob Thomasius: while biblical faith is based on theistic belief in acreatioex nihilo, paganism is based on belief in the eternity of the world, fromwhich derive the false doctrines of dualism, pantheism, or emanationism.As for Zoroaster, Brucker concludes that there is so much confusion abouthis identity that it is no longer possible to find out the truth; but themany writings attributed to Zoroaster are in fact not by him.223Notablythis goes for the famousChaldaean Oracles, which Brucker attributes quitecorrectly to later platonists224and describes as a compendium of pagansuperstitions. Likewise, the “secret doctrines” of the Egyptians consist ofnothing but idolatry and superstition; Brucker discusses Thoth or Hermesas their originator, and emphasizes the spurious nature of the writingsattributed to him.225Nothing found in this “philosophia barbarica” actually deserves the namephilosophy, and the beginnings of Greek thought are hardly more impres-sive.

Brucker of course doesnot use that term: rather confusingly, he speaks of the “secta eclectica”227while pointing out on many occasions that it is in fact an example of“syncretism that puts a knife to the throat of healthy philosophy.”228Neo-platonism is crucial to Brucker’s story, because it succeeded in becomingthe most successful and influential of all the sects. He discusses it in greatdetail, and sees it as part of a deliberate pagan strategy to counter the riseof Christianity:Since the pagan theology, through its many fables and other absurd teachings aboutthe gods, had come to be a horror not only for the Christians, who were now spread-ing all over the world, but even for the philosophers themselves . . . they sought togive themselves a better image by explaining the fables in a mystical manner andthereby free them from the accusation of absurdity. And because, moreover, theysaw that the Christian religion, being a highly reasonable philosophy, was acceptedwidely, also by great and respected men, and was defended by good people withclear proofs, they put much effort into plundering the philosophical doctrines ofthe ancients and bringing them into a system in such a way that they looked moresimilar to the Christian teaching, and more reasonable as well. And this is how theratio philosophandi eclecticacame into existence.229Since most of the neoplatonists had a melancholic temperament, they werecontinuously led astray by the products of their overheated imagination; inshort, their entire system rested on an “unfounded enthusiasm.”230Theydeliberately sought to infiltrate Christianity and corrupt it from within, forexample by promoting their own theurgical theories as the true explanationfor the miracles of Jesus and his apostles, and by introducing fraudulenttexts – such as the Hermetica – that superficially looked Christian butwere in fact grounded in paganism. As for the ancient philosophers whoseauthority they claimed, their true doctrines were completely distorted bythe neoplatonists:they also hatched all kinds of books, as scandalous and harmful miscarriages oftheir weird brains, and put them as strange eggs into the nest of the ancientphilosophers, presenting them as Chaldaean, Egyptian, Zoroastrian, Hermetic, or227Kurze Frageniii,427–873;Historiaii,189–462.228Kurze Frageniii,506.229Kurze Frageniii,431–432; cf. corresponding discussion inHistoriaii,192.230Kurze Frageniii,506–508;cf.Historiaii,363–367."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"144The history of errorOrphic monuments, and thereby made the entire history of philosophy extremelyuncertain.231In fact, the neoplatonists produced so many dangerous “eggs” of their own,that finally their teachings spread as an infectious plague all over Europeand Asia, while absorbing most of the other sects in the process.232What, then, is the essential doctrine of Neoplatonism? It teaches thatthere is one God with whom the human soul has a natural connectionand to whom he therefore seeks to return. There are hierarchies of higher,spiritual beings, such as gods, spirits, and angels, which are invisibly presenteverywhere. The purpose of prayer is to get in contact with these beings, andthis happens by means of ecstatic trances. Fortune-telling is an importantpart of such rituals, and, in sum, one can clearly see that the real purposeof this system is to promote “all the horrors of pagan superstition” andidolatry.233The great problem, of course, is that it succeeded. This waspartly due to the naivety of Christians, who used platonic terminology toconvert the heathens, and thereby unwittingly welcomed the virus, whichended up infiltrating the very body of Christian theology.We can be much briefer about the second great system, the “esotericphilosophy” of Judaism known as Kabbalah, not because Brucker givesit any less attention234but because it is based upon essentially the sameprocess: biblical faith being infected by pagan thought:and so there were famous Jewish teachers, who expounded the Kabbalah, that isto say, the secret tradition, and who applied the pythagorean, platonic and otherpagan inventions to the Law and the Book of Moses, and in so doing introduceda special and secret . . . dark and confused theology and philosophy. And they didit the way all philosophical and theological deceivers have always done it . . . : theyattributed a great antiquity to this kabbalistic teaching, presented it as the trueTradition and secret doctrine of the Patriarchs, of Abraham, of Moses and others,and even attributed to them writings whose plumage taken from the pagan flower-garden of philosophers clearly betrays their true assumptions and the nature of thedeception.235Kabbalah relates to the Old Testament as Neoplatonism relates to thegospel: in both cases, the purity of the biblical revelation is heavily com-promised by the pernicious influence (the “syncretic pest,”236as Bruckercalls it) of paganism, derived from the Chaldaeans and Egyptians, and from231Kurze Frageniii,520.232Kurze Frageniii,521.233Kurze Frageniii,574.234Kurze Frageniv,428–466,622–955;Historiaii,916–1069(“De philosophia Iudaeorum esoterica,sive cabbalistica”).235Kurze Frageniv,428–429.236Kurze Frageniv,428."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The historian: Jacob Brucker145degenerated Pythagoreanism and platonism as well. In both cases the resultwas, in Brucker’s opinion, an impenetrable mass of irrational speculation,expressed by means of obscure language and imagery.The revival of Neoplatonism and Kabbalah in the Renaissance is metic-ulously analyzed by Brucker,237with separate chapters for central figuressuch as Plethon,238Ficino,239Pico della Mirandola,240Reuchlin,241Gior-gio da Veneto,242Agrippa,243Patrizi,244and so on. These authors dug upthe old neoplatonic writings, along with the spurious texts attributed toHermes, Zoroaster or Orpheus and the Jewish kabbalah, as far as theyunderstood it, and out of it patched together a new philosophical system.It should be noted that Brucker’s analysis here is far more neutral andbusinesslike than before. Most of these authors are discussed respectfully,as honest Christians who had good intentions but were simply deluded.Brucker refutes their ideas essentially on scholarly grounds, by pointingout philological errors, misdatings, incorrect historical interpretations, andso on. In the end, all these errors can be traced back to the polluted sourceof Neoplatonism in late antiquity, and to the idea of aphilosophia perennisortranslatio sapientiae:For because they were of the opinion that the ancient Hebrew, Chaldaean, Egyp-tian, Orphic, Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy was essentially one and thesame thing, and that it all emanated from the ur-ancient divine philosophy, theyconcluded that everything in it had to be in harmony with the Christian religion,and as a result they attempted to reconcile these teachings – perverted and wronganyway, and packed together from all kinds of fraudulent texts – with the Christianreligion.245Brucker’s third great system, finally, that of Theosophy, stands somewhaton its own in his work.246He writes that it was created in a more recentperiod by authors who (quite rightly) abhorred all pagan and sectarianphilosophy, but nevertheless ended up inventing a new variation of it.Their systems are based not on the light of reason but on claims of inter-nal, divine illumination; by means of it, they believe they have privileged237Historiaiv,41–61(“De restauratoribus philosophiae Platonicae”),353–448(“De restauratoribusphilosophiae Pythagoreo-Platonico-Cabbalisticae”).238Kurze Fragenv,1410–1419.239Kurze Fragenv,1428–1443;Historiaiv,48–55.240Kurze Fragenv,1443–1456;Historiaiv,55–60.241Kurze Fragenvi,536–537;Historiaiv,357–374.242Kurze Fragenvi,573–586;Historiaiv,374–386.243Kurze Fragenvi,587–637;Historiaiv,386–421.244Kurze Fragenvi,637–655;Historiaiv,422–430.245Kurze Fragenvi,678, as part of Brucker’s general critical conclusions about the “pythagorean-platonic-kabbalistic philosophy”; and cf. the corresponding section inHistoriaiv,443–448.246Kurze Fragenvi,1063–1254;Historiaiv,644–750."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146The history of errorinsight into the deepest mysteries of nature, and know the secrets of magic,alchemy, astrology, and other such sciences.

The most impor-tant representatives are Paracelsus and his pupils,248Valentin Weigel,249Robert Fludd,250Jacob B ̈ohme and his followers,251father and son vanHelmont,252Pierre Poiret,253and the Rosicrucians.254In evaluating Theoso-phy as a whole, Brucker highlights its rejection of healthy rationality infavor of inner illumination, and its underlying system of emanation, whichteaches that all comes from God and returns to it.255Taken together, itall clearly comes down to a dangerous doctrine ofSchw ̈armereiand self-deification, grounded in the “secret hybris”256of the human heart, whichundermines sound reason along with Holy Scripture.With that, we return to the very foundations of Brucker’s history ofphilosophy, which, as should now be clear, likewise contains a com-plete history of its polemical “Other,” that is to say, all the currentsand ideas that are nowadays studied under the rubric of Western eso-tericism. The internal logic of Protestant anti-apologeticism had nowresulted in a clear distinction between three main domains in the history ofthought:(1)History of philosophy: the central concern for Heumann and Brucker.According to them, it had to be written according to a methodologyof eclecticism; that is to say, the historian’s task was to survey theentire history of thought, and select from it only those traditions thatwere in accord with sound human reason. It is on this basis that theseseventeenth-/eighteenth-century authors laid the foundations for themodern history of philosophy as an autonomous academic discipline.(2)Biblical revelation.

As a result of the radical anti-apologetic sepa-ration between revelation and reason, late seventeenth-century histo-riography found itself left with a very large domain of currents andideas that belonged to neither of the two camps, because they werecharacterized precisely by syncretic mixtures between the two. Essen-tially, this third domain representedthe continuation of pagan religionconcealed as Christianity. With philosophy it shared its pagan founda-tions, but it differed from philosophy in not being based on reason.With Christianity it shared its religious nature, but it differed fromChristianity in that it was false religion, not based on Revelation. Inshort, it was the non-rational “natural religion” of humanity. It is in thislate seventeenth-century, Protestant, anti-apologetic concept of paganreligion concealed as Christianity that we find both the historical originandthe theoretical core of our current concept of “Western esotericism”as a specific domain of research.Brucker’s work is representative of the historical moment at which thememory of the various currents and ideas belonging to this third domainwas still intact among intellectuals; but at the same time, it laid the foun-dations on which this memory would be marginalized by later generations.Not only did Brucker himself and all his anti-apologetic predecessors stillpay serious, sustained, and critical attention to all the main currents andpersonalities that belong to the study of Western esotericism – even moreimportant is that they did so on the basis of a consistent theoretical con-cept, which allowed them to think of the field as an essentially unitarytradition. However, the very nature of their theoretical concept impliedthat its representatives were the negative counterpart of both reason andfaith, and therefore could not claim to remain a legitimate part of thehistory of either. Once their non-philosophical and non-Christian naturewas clearly recognized, there was no further need to dignify them withmuch attention in the history of either philosophy or Christianity.

Butbecause this view of history could not keep its ground against the rational standardof historical-philological criticism and against the progressive thrust of Enlight-enment philosophy of history, it found itself increasingly pushed into the esotericsub-currents of intellectual history . . . [With the liberation of philosophy from itstheological context], the critical potential of a rationality free of theology was ableto flourish, and to establish itself as criticism of metaphysics [Metaphysikkritik].Its eventual success finally resulted, during the eighteenth century, in the esoteri-cization of the ancient model ofphilosophia adepta, which was pushed towardsmarginal circles.257In other words, the ancient wisdom narrative now lost its status as a seriousoption in mainstream intellectual discourse, but survived as the historio-graphical model to which most modern esoteric currents adhere. As we sawat the end of the previous chapter, Platonic Orientalism remained, and stillremains, fundamental to how modern and contemporary esotericists imag-ine their own tradition. But in this chapter we now have also investigatedthe other side of the coin. The anti-pagan and anti-platonic tradition of theRenaissance, particularly under the influence of the witchcraft debate, hadthe effect of turning the ancient wisdom narrative into its radical opposite:far from representing the light of divine truth, it came to be imagined asits sinister enemy, up to the extreme imaginary of a demonic “genealogyof darkness” originating in the machinations of “the ancient serpent,” thedevil. This alarmist narrative, with its paranoid and conspiratorial connota-tions, has survived notably in the (still insufficiently studied) anti-occultistand anti-satanist literature of Christian evangelical and fundamentalistauthors.258257Lehmann-Brauns,Weisheit,6,19.258On evangelical and fundamentalist depictions of the New Age movement, see Saliba,ChristianResponses,39–88, esp.51–53; Kemp, “Christians and New Age”; Kemp,New Age,133–137.

But in the decades around1700, two new paradigms evolvedout of these traditional models, and these have become highly successful inestablishing foundations of how “Western esotericism” came to be concep-tualized in academic contexts after the Enlightenment. The first of themhas been referred to here as “religionism,” and traced to Gottfried Arnold’sinnovative construct of the history of Christianity. Religionism may bedefined as an approach to religion (in Arnold’s case: Christian religion)that presents itself explicitly as “historical” but nevertheless denies, or atleast strongly minimizes, the relevance of any questions pertaining to his-torical “influences,” and hence of historical criticism, because of its centralassumption that the true referent of religion does not lie in the domainof human culture and society but only in a direct, unmediated, personalexperience of the divine. In Arnold’s case, this was a highly effective strategyfor ignoring any line of argumentation that might threaten the integrityof Christian religion by relating it to “pagan” influences. In its later devel-opment, as will be seen, the essential logic of religionism would allowacademics to ignore, or reject, any argumentation that might threaten theintegrity of “religion” as such by relating (and thereby potentially reduc-ing) it to historical or social factors. In all its phases of development, thecrucial reference of religionist approaches is to an irreducible experience of“the sacred,” considered as a realitysui generis. We will see how importantthis perspective was to become to modern academic understandings of“Western esotericism.”The second new paradigm emerging in the decades around1700wasbased upon Enlightenment eclecticism, and clearly emerges in the workof authors such as Heumann and Brucker. Whereas the core conceptof religionism is direct, personal, unmediated religious experience, itsEnlightenment counterpart is autonomous human rationality and “soundjudgment.” The basic assumption of the Enlightenment paradigm is thatReason is the universal yardstick for evaluating the truth or seriousness ofany worldview, whether religious or philosophical. Religious or philosoph-ical currents and ideas that are perceived as not satisfying the criterion ofrationality lose their right to be taken seriously in intellectual discourse:"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"150The history of errorthey are delegated to the categories of “prejudice,” “superstition,” “fool-ishness,” or “stupidity.” In that process of exclusion – and this point isparticularly important to emphasize – they are tacitly divested of theirtraditional status as players in the field of history, and transformed intonon-historical universals of human thinking and behavior. In other words,one no longer needs to discuss them as traditions, such as “platonism,”“hermeticism,” or even “paganism,” but can dismiss them as synonymouswith irrationality as such.The Enlightenment paradigm and its religionist counterpart have morein common than one might think at first sight. Both are ideological, notempirical: they do not start by investigating historical evidence, but bystipulating “absolute” criteria of truthapriori, and whatever does notsatisfy those criteria is without any further interest to them. Applied tohistorical materials, this necessarily results in highly selective procedures:the goal is that of finding the treasures of truth hidden in the forests ofhistory –notthat of exploring those forests for their own sakes! As a result,the religionist and Enlightenment paradigms both fall short, and seriouslyso, as methodological frameworks for historiography proper. With respectto the study of Western esotericism specifically, we will see that the formerhas tended to “reify” it as an autonomous spiritual traditionsui generisat the expense of historical and social context, while the latter has eitherignored its very existence, or simply treated it with contempt as the pariahof Western thought.In contrast to both paradigms, it is the anti-apologetic current – fromJacob Thomasius through Colberg, and even up to and including Brucker –that appears to have created the essential foundations for a properly histori-cal/empirical and therefore non-ideological study of Western esotericism.259Such a thesis might seem counter-intuitive at first sight: after all, thesestaunch Protestants were declared enemies of anything that we might cat-egorize as “esoteric,” and far from wanting to turn it into a separate fieldof research, they would much rather have seen it disappear altogether. Itis also true that the essentially non-historical Enlightenment perspectiveon Western esotericism emerged from the same anti-apologetic current,in the writings of Christian Thomasius, Heumann, and Brucker; and thatthe latter prepared the eclipse of Platonic Orientalism, and everything ithad come to imply, by carefully separating each of its single components259For the basic argument in favor of an “empirical” and historical perspective based upon “method-ological agnosticism,” against the religionist and reductionist alternatives, see Hanegraaff, “Empir-ical Method.”"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The parting of the ways151from “true philosophy” along Heumannian lines, and thus readying it forexclusion by the next generation.

What it means is that “religion” isunderstood as a human phenomenon, in sharp contrast to the truth believed to be revealed by Godhimself in the Jewish and Christian traditions: a distinction that amounts to treating “religion”as an equivalent of “paganism,” thereby deliberately including Roman Catholicism under thelatter rubric. This basic perspective was famously formulated by Karl Barth in the seventeenthparagraph of hisKirchliche Dogmatik, where he presented the absolute authority of “Revelation”over “religion” in the most extreme form possible, leading to the notorious conclusion “Religionist Unglaube” (Religion is unbelief ). Barth left no doubt that his concept of Christian theologywas the polar opposite of any scholarly study of religion (Religionswissenschaft), because the latter,instead of accepting the absolute truth of Revelation, reduced it to just another hegemonic claimmade by a religion, Christianity in this case.

As a result, itbecame the domain of amateur scholars.The attitudes of these authors covered the complete spectrum from utterskepticism and hostility to “the occult” via antiquarian curiosity aboutthe quaint beliefs of bygone ages to an enthusiastic embrace of “higherreligious truths,” but their common emphasis on the natural sciences ledall of them to perceive the field from a new angle: rather than (crypto)paganphilosophy or “Platonic-Hermetic Christianity,” what they saw was a set oftraditional ways of understandingnature, exemplified by what now cameto be known as the “secret” or “occult” sciences of natural magic, astrology,and alchemy. Such a shift of emphasis was easy enough, for the first twoof these – and particularly their combination in the form of astral magic –had been part and parcel of the worldviews defended in the context of theancient wisdom narrative since Ficino, and we will see how the final onehad become practically inseparable from it somewhat later, particularly inthe wake of Paracelsus and his followers.Because of their focus on philosophy and theology, the anti-apologistshad mentioned these arts or sciences only in passing, without assigningthem a very important role in their constructs of pagan heresy. But thiswould no longer do for a new generation of authors whose worldviews weredeeply impacted by the new natural sciences and philosophies. To them, itwas becoming evident that the decisive battle over religious truth and errorwould be decided over the question of what, exactly, was to be understood3For the persistence of “Platonic Orientalist” assumptions in classicist scholarship from the eighteenththrough the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, see Jaap Mansfeld’s fascinating and extremely well-documented analysis of how an Anaximander fragment has been interpreted from secular as well as“mystical” or “pantheist” perspectives (Mansfeld, “Bothering the Infinite”).4As programmatically formulated in Gladigow, “Pantheismus als ‘Religion’ von Naturwissen-schaftlern,”219–220."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The error of history155by “nature,” what its limits were (if any), and what the answers impliedfor the status of spiritual and divine agency, and hence for the Christianreligion: in short, did nature leave any room for the divine?

On theother hand, “enchanted” concepts of nature as a kind of organism ani-mated by a spiritual force could be defended precisely because they seemedto preserve God’s universal presence and activity in the world; but theywere vulnerable to the criticism that they did so by blurring any distinc-tion between God and his creation, leading to the dreaded position ofpantheism. It will be remembered that precisely such a concept (the co-eternity of God and the world) had been highlighted by Jacob Thomasiusas the core doctrine of all pagan error, and sharply contrasted with thedoctrine ofcreatio ex nihilo. This basic theological perspective, of whichThomasius Sr. was only one representative, was particularly prominentin Protestant circles, and eventually came to dominate the mainstreamof Enlightenment thought even among atheist thinkers. That it greatlyfacilitated the acceptance of the mechanical philosophy is an understate-ment, and it certainly made it easy to perceive any panentheist conceptof “living nature” as tainted with pagan superstition.

We will see that anachronistic distortions,and hence bad scholarship, are not just likely but unavoidable if the threeterms are used in an uncritical manner to interpret the past.9Each of themhas a very long and complex history, and none of them should be usedinnocently or naively on the assumption that “everyone knows what ismeant”: the fact is that almost nobody does, although most people thinkthey do. Most important of all, these three terms are qualitatively differentfrom more straightforwardly descriptive (although, as will be seen, by nomeans unproblematic) ones such as, notably, “astrology,” “alchemy,” and“divination,” in that most of their current meanings and connotations arerelatively recentandintrinsically biased. Although the terms “superstition,”“magic,” and “occult” have long histories, they were essentiallyreinventedduring the period of the Enlightenment, in such a manner that they couldserve to demarcate “the Other of science and rationality.” This has twoimportant implications. One is that applying them to earlier periods leadsto anachronistic distortions, because Enlightenment preoccupations arethereby projected upon materials that have very little to do with them. Asecond is that they are wholly unsuitable as neutral instruments in schol-arly interpretation: they belong to the category of value judgments10andpoliticalKampfbegriffe(battle concepts),11not of valid “etic” terminology.In this chapter, I will therefore analyze them strictly as “emic” terms.12One9Curry,Prophecy and Power,3–4, with nn.10–11.10Jonathan Z. Smith,Relating Religion,218.11Hagner, “Bye-bye Science,”22.12Briefly stated, the adjective “emic” refers to statements, terminologies, concepts, or technical per-spectives as used and understood by those who are being studied, while “etic” refers to statements,terminologies, concepts, or technical perspectives as used by scholars (in their attempts to interpretemic statements, terminologies, concepts, or technical perspectives). Hotly debated by anthropolo-gists since its introduction in1954(Pike,Language), the emic/etic distinction remains indispensableif we wish to avoid, or at least minimize, the risk of conceptual anachronism in disciplines like thehistory of religion or of science. As formulated by Nick Jardine, “etics without emics is empty, emicswithout etics is blind” (Jardine, “Etics and Emics,”275): one needs to study the exact meaning ofterms as used in their original historical context, but very often one also needs new terminologiesto make better sense of them. For example, inChapter1, I analyzed a historical discourse thatused emic terms such asprisca theologiaorphilosophia perennis, but argued that the etic concept“Platonic Orientalism” may be useful as a tool for understanding the nature of that discourse. It isimportant to understand that the emic/etic distinction is not static and closed, but dialectic andopen-ended: by definition, the moment a given scholar’s etic terminology is made into an object ofstudy by other scholars, it is thereby turned into emic language. As such, its implications, subjectiveconnotations, underlying agendas, and so on, can be critically evaluated by the scholars doing theinvestigation, who may well be using etic terminology of their own to do so – which can likewisebe turned into an object of critical investigation by others, and so onad infinitum.

On the contrary,they undoubtedly succeededbecauseof that dependence. We will see thatthis fact is a major key to understanding much that has gone wrong inacademic research on Western esotericism, as indeed in several other areasof the study of religion.The term “superstition”13is undoubtedly the most uniformly pejorativeof the three key terms, although that is not how it began its career. Currentideas about superstition are still strongly influenced by the legacy of thefounder of cultural anthropology Edward Burnett Tylor, and his discussionof “magic” and “survivals” in his famousPrimitive Cultureof1871. Tylorfound the term “superstition” too strongly loaded with pejorative conno-tations to be used as a scholarly concept, and hence coined the term “sur-vivals” as an alternative.14In so doing, he actually adopted the etymologicalroot of the very word “superstition,”superstes, which refers to “surviving.”15Tylor himself carefully distinguished “survivals” from “magic,” and dis-cussed them in separate chapters; but later readers were less precise, andhave frequently treated the two concepts as coming down to one and thesame thing. This has had the unfortunate result that, on the tacit assump-tion that there is little difference between magic and superstition anyway,Tylor’s definition of magic (discussed below) has often been applied tosuperstition as well, so that the latter came to stand for beliefs and practicesthat presuppose a faulty understanding of cause and effect.16However,projecting the Tylorian concept back into periods earlier than the nine-teenth century results in serious anachronisms, for the various meaningsof superstition in pre- and early modern periods turn out to be entirelydifferent, and their influence on modern concepts of superstition is bothmore subtle and more pervasive than usually appreciated.emic, is contextual, etic language can never claim any perfect “objectivity”; but subjective biasesand anachronistic projections can be recognized for what they are, and replaced by alternatives thatare less distorting, more neutral, and therefore more suitable for “etic” discourse. The analogy withtranslation from one language to another is close and instructive: perfection will forever elude us,but this does not imply the impossibility of replacing bad translations with superior ones.13For the historical developments summarized here, see Schmitt, “Les ‘superstitions’”; Pott,Aufkl ̈arungund Aberglaube,1–77.

Hence,deisidaimoniacould mean an appropriate awe orrespect for the gods (for example, the apostle Paul respectfully addressedthe Athenians asdeisidaimonesin Acts17:22).17However, as pointed outby Dale Martin, it was turned into a negative term in the context of anew and revolutionary concept introduced by Plato and Aristotle, who“taught that the ontological hierarchy of nature was matched by an ethicalhierarchy: beings who were superior in nature and power were assumed tobe superior ethically.”18Based upon this axiom, the gods were good andbenevolent by definition, and there could not be any reason to be afraidof them. Thinking otherwise was a clear sign of ignorance. It was fromthis perspective that the termdeisidaimoniacame to be used by the laterphilosophical elite (from the fourth centurybcon) as a term of disdainfor popular and irrational beliefs about harmful deities, and the variouscultic practices based upon misguided fear of the gods.19The earlylocusclassicusfor “superstition” in this sense is Theophrast’s amusing sketch of“The Superstitious Man” (fourth centurybc).20However, cracks in thephilosophical concept of a matching ontological and ethical hierarchy hadbegun to appear by the beginning of the Common Era, as philosophersbegan to doubt whetherdaimoneswere really all good and benevolent;21andin their polemics against pagan intellectuals, Christians turned the tableson their pagan opponents by arguing that the so-called gods were actuallyevil demons.22Hence the notion ofdeisidaimoniaas “fear of demons”became firmly enshrined in Christian thinking.As for the Latinsuperstitio: like its Greek equivalent it was originally apositive or neutral term, referring in this case to the practices of soothsay-ing, divination or prophecy, which, in traditional Roman religion, wereperfectly acceptable.23However, from the first century on, it acquired newconnotations of political danger. The Greek philosophical elite consideredsuperstitious behavior as shameful, ridiculous and perhaps blasphemous,17See Grant,Gods and the One God,19.18Martin,Inventing Superstition,76.19Note that positive or neutral understandings ofdeisidaimoniadid not vanish right away, butcontinued to exist next to negative ones (Martin,Inventing Superstition,83;Koets,Д\u0005\u000b\u0005\f\u0003\u0005\r\t\u000e\u000f\u0003,99; Diggle, in Theophrast,Characters,349).20Theophrast,Characters,110–113(and commentary:348–375).21Martin,Inventing Superstition,93–108.22Ibid.,160–186,207–225.23Martin,Inventing Superstition,126; Harmening,Superstitio,15; Calderone, “Superstitio,”387–389."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"160The error of historybut not as particularly dangerous; in the Roman Empire, however,super-stitiocame to be seen as referring to the “depraved, strange, spooky anddishonorable” religious practices imported from foreign peoples, such asthe Egyptians, Druids or Chaldaeans.24In short, it referred to the “reli-gion of the Other,” whose presence might pose a threat to political stability.This perception ofsuperstitioas politically subversive and socially dangerouscould only be further enhanced by its association with individual, privaterites instead of the public and officially sanctioned rituals of Roman statereligion: in this respect,superstitiooverlaps strongly with Roman conceptsof magic.25As the term was adopted by Christians, its original referenceto practices like soothsaying, divination and prophecy inevitably mingledwith the “fear of demons” central to its Greek equivalent; and becausethose demons were seen as none other than the gods of the pagans, thepractices traditionally known assuperstitiobecame all but synonymous, inthe minds of Christians, with the religious sinpar excellence, idolatry. Asdemonstrated in great detail by Dieter Harmening in his standard work onthe subject, the notion of idolatrous practice grounded in fear of demonsbecame central to how superstition was understood in church regulationsand theological discussions throughout the Middle Ages (with Augustineand Thomas Aquinas as particularly influential voices).26The term wasapplied to a very wide spectrum of practices, subdivided by Harmeninginto the categoriessuperstitio observationis(such as the reading of signsand omens, visions, dreams, oracles, and the observation of “good or badtimes”),superstitio divinationis(including notably astrology, but also necro-mancy and a variety of other mantic arts), andsuperstitio artis magicae(towhich we will return). All of these were therefore seen as implying contactwith pagan deities, or demons, whose persistent goal was to get humanbeings to turn away from God and worship them instead.Next to “fear of demons” and “idolatry,” there is yet a third centraldimension to the concept of superstition, which goes back again to theGreekdeisidaimonia. Under the influence of Aristotle’s notions of “moder-ation,” “balance,” and “the mean,” it came to be seen, by the philosophicalelite, as referring to immoderate, excessive, unbalanced forms of ritualpractice inspired by, again, an unfounded fear of the gods.27The elementof ritual “excess” remained a central element of superstition throughout24Martin,Inventing Superstition,132–133.25For some of the extremes to which the imagination of the demonic Other could lead, see, forexample, Stratton,Naming the Witch,71–105.26Harmening, Superstitio,34,43,andpassim.27Martin,Inventing Superstition, esp.26–27,67–72."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Tainted terminologies 1: superstition161the Middle Ages,28and one finds it still routinely referred to far into themodern period.

As formulated by Stuart Clark, “that [RomanCatholicism] was the quintessence of superstition was a view so generalto Protestant cultures that it ranks as the merest of commonplaces in thehistory of early modern religion.”31This fact is documented by innumer-able passages in the oeuvres of Luther and Calvin, but also in an enormousrange of polemical or satirical writings by lesser-known Protestants, wherethe terms “idolatry” and “superstition” (orAberglaube) are used as whollyinterchangeable, and turned with a truly incredible vehemence against suchexamples of “excessive” ritual as the Roman Catholic Mass, the adorationof the host and the sacraments in general, the veneration of images ofMary or the saints and their relics, the belief in purgatory, Masses for thedead, vigils and funeral services, fasting, the baptism of church bells orcandles, relics, indulgences, pilgrimages, and so on and so forth.32Luther,Calvin and their followers essentially adopted the authoritative perspectivesof Augustine and Aquinas, but with an added emphasis on justificationby faith alone and the supreme grandeur of God: the superstitious mansearches for salvation and consolation in his own “good works,” and therebyhopes to earn (or even “force”) his salvation instead of giving himself overto God’s mercy, while relying on idols made by his own hands whichdiminish the absolute sovereignty of his Creator. The Reformers developedtheir full-scale attack on Roman Catholic “superstition and idolatry” inthe context of a frightening demonology and a vivid expectation of theimminent Judgment, after which the damned would be facing an eternity28Harmening,Superstitio,16–25,39–40,andpassim.29Conf ́erences du dioceze du Puy(1673), in Dompnier, “Les hommes d’ ́eglise,”22.30D.

The idea that God is immanent in the naturalworld is seen as opening the door to a belief in invisible beings presenteverywhere in nature; but instead of being condemned as sin, the paganidolatry implied by such belief is lampooned as an illusion. On suchfoundations, it became easy to conclude, as did theEncyclop ́edie,thatsuperstition is “the unhappy daughter of the imagination”:38after all, thenatural world may be empty of numinous presences, but seems filledwith them if only we imagine them to be there. One sees how easilywe arrive, by this route, at what Lorraine Daston and Katherine Parkrefer to as the Enlightenment’s “Unholy Trinity: Enthusiasm, Superstition,Imagination.”39What conclusions may be drawn from the above? Although highlyinnovative in defining superstition as an intellectual error and opposingit to science, Enlightenment constructs of superstition remained firmlyrooted in traditionaltheologicalconcepts of paganism as fear of demons,idolatry, and ritual excess. It is no exaggeration to say that the basic errorEnlightenment ideologues tried to remove from Christian culturewaspaganism, but now redefined as its long-standing weakness for imaginingthe presence of spiritual realities in nature (the very same concept thatwould famously be labeled “animism” by Tylor at the end of the nineteenthcentury).40For thinkers with Christian commitments, and Protestants inparticular, this was an extremely attractive perspective, for it allowed themto align themselves with scientific progress in a joint campaign to finishthe job of purifying Christianity from its ancient nemesis. Although wehave learned to think of the Enlightenment crusade against superstition asa battle of science against nonsensical “pseudo-science,” this perception istherefore misleading. Rather, it was a straight continuation of the old battleof Christian theology against paganism, but now fought with a potent newweapon. This weapon wasnot, as usually assumed, that of scientific andrational argument, for even the decline of astrology cannot be convincinglyattributed to those factors,41and Enlightenment thinkers hardly bothered38D. J. [Louis de Jaucourt], “Superstition,”669–670.39Daston and Park,Wonders,334–343.40Tylor presented animism (“belief in spiritual beings”) as basic to “religion” and tried to keep itsharply apart from “magic” (defined as grounded in a confused understanding of causality), butsignificantly, these two domains actually blurred and overlapped precisely in the manifestationpar excellenceof paganism, that of “idolatry” (Hanegraaff, “Emergence of the Academic Scienceof Magic”). This neglected fact strongly underlines the point that is made here: although Tylorwas trying to avoid the pejorative concept of “superstition,” it remained inseparable frombothhiscentral categories, animism and magic.41Tester,History,214,225,240;Curry,Prophecy and Power,138–139; Meinel, “Okkulte und exakteWissenschaften,”38; Rutkin, “Astrology”; von Stuckrad,Geschichte der Astrologie,242–286, esp."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"164The error of historyto refute “superstitious” beliefs.42They had discovered a simpler and muchmore effective tool to rid the world of invisible spirits: ridicule.We will encounter many illustrations of these basic points, but, for now,the representative case of Voltaire must suffice. Essentially, his battle was notagainst Christianity, or against religion as such, but against the pagan errorsthat had crept into it. Thus, in his treatise on tolerance he followed traditionin seeing astrology assuperstitio, but did so by setting it against religion,not science: “Superstition is to religion what astrology is to astronomy:that is the very foolish daughter of a wise and intelligent mother.”43Lesswell known than this oft-quoted witticism, which praises both scienceand religion as “wise and intelligent,” is the entry “Superstition” in hisDictionnaire philosophique, where he states that “Almost everything thatgoes beyond the worship of a supreme Being and the submission of theheart to his eternal orders is superstition,”44and emphasizes its relationto fanaticism. And as far as history was concerned, Voltaire appears tohave been entirely in line with the anti-apologist perspective: “Born inpaganism, adopted by Judaism, superstition infected the Christian Churchfrom the very beginning.”45tainted terminologies 2: magicIf historical and conceptual analyses of “superstition” have been relativelyrare,magicis undoubtedly one of the most heavily theorized concepts inthe study of religion. As noted by Marco Pasi, there seem to be almostas many definitions of “magic” as there have been scholars writing aboutit.46Nevertheless, on closer scrutiny, most of these definitions turn out tobe variations on a few extremely influential theories.47(1) “Intellectualist”approaches are linked to the names of Edward Burnett Tylor, who definedmagic as based upon “the error of mistaking ideal analogy for real analogy”253–260. Notice, however, that von Stuckrad’s post-Foucauldian methodology (seeChapter4,pp.362–367) has the effect of reducing any critical debate to an instance of discursive competition,which is then automatically about power rather than content, so that the very question of thescientific status of astrology becomes a non-issue for him (for the logic of this line of argument,against the background of skepsis over the demarcation criterion of science in the wake of Kuhn,Lakatos, and Feyerabend, see Hagner, “Bye-bye Science,”31–41). But content was important and theforce of arguments did matter: they were not just convenient weapons in power competition, buthad (and have) the ability to convince. Whiggish or “presentist” interpretations by which currentconcepts of “science” are projected back into the seventeenth century are certainly misleading, butit remains possible to analyze historically how the scientific status of astrology changed in parallelwith the development (!) of what seventeenth-century authors understood by “science.”42For example, Thorndike, “L’Encyclop ́edie,”376.43Voltaire,Treatise on Tolerance,83.44Voltaire,Dictionnaire philosophique,394.45Ibid.,396.46Pasi, “Notion de magie,”38.47For a more detailed discussion, see Hanegraaff, “Magic I.”"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Tainted terminologies 2: magic165(that is, the erroneous assumption of “primitive man” that things associ-ated in his thinking must be connected in actual fact),48and James G.Frazer, who simplified Tylor’s approach into his famous evolutionist triad:humanity had evolved from magic, through religion, to science. For Frazer,magic actually meantsympatheticmagic, based upon the assumption that“things act on each other at a distance through a secret sympathy” or “aninvisible ether.”49Both definitional approaches were based upon science,not religion, as the theoretical opposite of magic: it was seen as groundedin merely imaginary analogies, correspondences, and invisibles forces, incontrast to the causal mechanisms basic to positivist science.50(2)“Func-tionalist” approaches to magic are linked to the names of Marcel Mauss andEmile Durkheim, and concentrate on ritual action. Mauss used the termmagic for “any rite that is not part of an organized cult: a rite that is private,secret, mysterious, and ultimately tending towards one that is forbidden.”51Along very similar lines, Durkheim defined religious beliefs as shared by,and constitutive of, a social group (referred to as a “Church”), whereasmagic was inherently non-social: “There is no Church of magic.”52Func-tionalist approaches are therefore based upon religion, not science, as thetheoretical opposite of magic: as formulated by Durkheim, “there is some-thing inherently anti-religious about the maneuvers of the magician.”53(3) A third approach, finally, derives from a theoretical concept central tothe oeuvre of Lucien L ́evy-Bruhl – remarkably, since he himself saw it asequally applicable to magic and religion.54It was based upon the perceivedcontrast between a worldview or mentality grounded in “instrumentalcausality” (which assumes the presence of secondary causes or mechanismsthat mediate between causes and effects) and one grounded in “partici-pation” (where causes and effects are seen as associated, or merging, tothe point of identity or consubstantiality, without assuming the presenceof mediating links).55At first L ́evy-Bruhl considered it to be typical of48Ty l o r,Primitive Religion,vol.i,116.49Frazer,Golden Bough,vol.i,54.50See detailed analysis of Tylor and Frazer in Hanegraaff, “Emergence of the Academic Science ofMagic.”51Mauss, “Esquisse,”16.52Durkheim,Les formes ́el ́ementaires,61(emphasis in the original).

Based largely on caricatures such as those found in BronislawMalinowski’s criticism of L ́evy-Bruhl,56and a neglect of his lateCarnets,later scholars came to assume that participation and magic were meant tobe equivalent terms, leading to a spate of theories that interpret magic asgrounded in a “different kind of rationality.”57In theories of this kind,it is clearly science, not religion, that serves as the theoretical opposite ofmagic: alternatives to instrumental causality are believed to be the heart ofthe matter.The basic theoretical approaches represented by Tylor, Mauss, and L ́evy-Bruhl have been mixed, combined, adapted, and reinterpreted by laterauthors in manifold ways, but almost without exception on the basis of atacit acceptance of the triad “magic – religion – science” as universal con-cepts. As noted by Jonathan Z. Smith, this fact is highly problematic froma theoretical point of view, as it breaks conventional definitory rules andleads to interpretational frameworks that are riddled with inconsistencies.His conclusion is that magic cannot be salvaged as an etic term; and infact, in the study of religion since the1990s it seems to be in the processof vanishing from standard terminology.58However, it is not just for rea-sons of strict conceptual logic that “magic” is losing its traditional statusas a “second-order” or etic term, defined by its opposition to both “reli-gion” and “science.” This development also reflects a general trend, afterthe fall of the Berlin wall, of widespread disaffection among intellectualswith the “grand narratives” of modernity, and critical attention to theirimplicit ideological agendas.59Although radical “postmodern” versions ofthis phenomenon have received most attention in the popular media, manyhistorians have found that one does not need the theoretical machineryof French post-structuralism to understand a very basic point about muchof traditional terminology in the study of religion: its thorough depen-dence on normative modernist ideologies and implicit hegemonic claims56Malinowski, “Magic, Science and Religion”; cf.

The evidence in this regard, aslaid out in detail by Styers, is so abundant and straightforward that one canonly marvel at how long, and how effectively, this essentialist and total-izing discourse on “magic versus religion and science” has kept academicsspellbound, as if they were trapped themselves in a magic circle withoutescape:62“you cannot talk about magic without using the term magic,”60Ibid.,512–516; and see in particular the thoroughly convincing discussion in Styers,Making Magic,14–21,69–119.61Styers’Making Magicanalyzes academic theories of magic as reflective of three basic modernistconcerns: the regulation (social, political, discursive) of piety, of reason, and of desire. As pointedout by Pasi (“Notion de magie,”41–50), an important predecessor of Styers’ basic approach wasthe Italian scholar of religion Ernesto de Martino, in hisMagia e civilt`a(1962). Whereas Styersconcentrates on the process of modernization, de Martino emphasized that the “anti-magicalpolemic” has been central to the historical process of Western identity-formation since the earlyChristian period, so that modernist discourses of magic should be seen within a larger historicalcontext and related to discursive formations that go back to the origins of Christianity if not evenfurther. Pasi points out that while his conclusions confirm de Martino’s pioneering intuitions, Styershimself seems to underestimate the extent to which his own work results in a relativization – moreprecisely, perhaps, deconstruction – of the very concept of “magic” understood as a reified categoryof universal application (“Notion de magie,”49; and on the “magical” reification of “magic” byscholars, see, for example, Styers,Making Magic,223). One sign of this is the fact that whereasStyers thoroughly deconstructs the term “magic,” he speaks of “superstition” as if its meaning andits relation to magic are unproblematic and not in need of any explanation (for example,ibid.,43,48,51–55,165–167).62My metaphors are inspired by Styers,Making Magic,3: “The core of my argument is that thesetheories of magic are, in essential respects, magical.” Cf.ibid.,216–217."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"168The error of historyas exclaimed by Versnel in1991.63The vicious circle is broken, however,once we recognize that the magic “out there” is believed to “exist” onlybecausewehave first decided to call it “magic.” It is literally a creature of thetheoretical imagination, conjured into existence by the same intellectualfallacy that has so often been considered the very essence of magic: theconfusion of mental concepts with actual realities, so that what we believewe understand in our mind seems to exist in the external world.The conclusion would seem inevitable. The term “magic” is an impor-tant objectofhistorical research, but definitely unsuitable as an etic instru-mentfordoing research. It should simply not be used as a general category,as happens whenever a scholar states or implies that this or that practice orbelief “is” magic or magical. Unfortunately, however, scholars have beenevery bit as active as “believers” in promoting this culture-specific termi-nology as if it were universal, or naively believing in its universality; andall along the line they have fallen prey, again like believers, to the temp-tation of presenting normative biases and subjective convictions as if theywere “disinterested” observations and “objective” truths. Once the famous“magic – religion – science” triad has been demystified as the academicghost it is, what we are left with is writing the history, not of magic assuch, but of emicconceptsof magic, and of how these have been appliedto a wide range of practices and beliefs in different periods of history.64As63Versnel quite rightly observes about his colleagues that “practically no one escapes moments ofreduced concentration when they suddenly fall into using unsophisticated common sense concepts,though they sometimes betray their awareness of the lapse by putting the term magic betweeninverted commas or adding ‘so-called’” (“Some Reflections,”181). For example, even a very carefulscholar like de Jong does not manage to evade circular reasoning entirely, when he writes thattheGreekscametousetheterm\u001f\u0011\f\u000f\u0011and its cognates to denote something already knownas\t\u0004\u0007, meaning “sorcerers, quacks,magicians” (emphasis added) and their activities (Traditionsof the Magi,387); similarly, Jan Bremmer seems to suggest that magic is an unproblematicallyuniversal human phenomenon existing already long before it was named, when he writes that “Thepractice of magic probably goes back several millennia, but the origin of the term has its roots inancient Greece” (“Birth of the Term ‘Magic’,” [2002version],1). The point here isnotto deny thatcommonalities between certain kinds of religious behavior may be sufficiently strong to considerthem as belonging to one and the same general category: that such a category did exist in antiquityis argued convincingly, for example, by Dickie (Magic and Magicians,27). Rather, the point is thatour modern term “magic” is unsuitable as a label for that category, because it has acquired so manynewconnotations after antiquity, and these are so tightly bound up with our own post-Reformationand post-Enlightenment identities, that even by the wildest stretch of imagination they cannotbe applicable to, for example, the fifth centurybce. For that reason (contraDickie, Versnel, orBremmer) we should resist the temptation of using our term “magic” in discussing what may havebeen known as\r\u0003\u0004\u000f\u0003ormagiain Greek and Roman antiquity. Again, the problem isnotthe useof etic terminology as such (which is often indispensable in scholarly analysis, as pointed out, forexample, by Dickie,Magic and Magicians,18–20, in agreement with Versnel and Bremmer, as wellas Jardine, “Etics and Emics”), but the use ofthisparticular terminology.64See also Pasi, “Theses de magia,”2(thesis0and0.1).

You would also belikely to get a catalogue of different forms of magic, and most of thevarieties would be species of divination.”70The decisive change in these traditional understandings occurred aroundthe thirteenth century, with the emergence ofmagia naturalisas an alter-native to demonic magic. The historical backgrounds to this developmentare well known, and will only be sketched here very briefly.71With the dis-integration of the Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek had vanished fromWestern Europe almost completely; and by the time of Boethius’ deathin524, only a limited number of classic philosophical and scientific workshad been translated into Latin. With the relative exception of medicine,secular learning declined in the West for a period of600years. However,it survived in the eastern parts of the former empire, and, with the rapidexpansion of Islam after Muhammad’s death in632, much of the regionswhere Greek learning was still intact came under Muslim rule. A large-scaleundertaking of translating the philosophical and scientific texts into Arabicgot under way during the eighth century, eventually leading to a vibrantintellectual culture in which scores of Muslim authors revised and fur-ther developed the Greek sciences, thereby transforming them into Islamicones.72This wealth of Arabic science rooted in classic Hellenistic cultureremained unknown to the Latin West until the later Middle Ages. Gerbertof Aurillac (the later Pope Sylvester II) in the tenth century and Constan-tine the African in the eleventh studied in Islamic Spain, and began makingtranslations, but it was only after the monarch Alfonso VI of Castile tookcontrol of Toledo in1085that Christian intellectuals gained full access tothe magnificent collections of the Iberian peninsula.

In other words, ancient Greek astrology in its strictestinterpretation was the most comprehensive scientific theory of antiquity, providingthrough the application of the mathematical models appropriate to it predictionsof all changes that take place in the world of cause and effect . . .76However, such an “internalist” approach focused on the actual nature ofastrology, no matter how justified in itself, does not suffice for understand-ing its career in Western culture: at least as important is its social statusand the way it was perceived by the wider culture. As a divinatory art and73For a beautiful evocation of the richness of this medieval Spanish culture, see Menocal,Ornamentof the World,here33.74Because alchemy will be discussed separately in the next section, the argument about the conceptmagia naturaliswill here be made with reference to astrology, which is most central to it in any case.75Thorndike, “True Place of Astrology,”276. Even Thorndike’s opponent George Sarton (see below,Chapter4,pp.318–323) agreed on this point: “Pure astrology was a very remarkable scientific system;it provided a congruous explanation of the world” (Review of Lynn Thorndike [1924],85).76Pingree, “Hellenophilia,”560(this does not mean that Pingree believes astrology is true: “on thecontrary, I believe it to be totally false” [ibid.,559]).

Thorndike’s thesis that during the Middle Ages “even the most educated men believedin astrology” (Place of Magic,5) is mildly misleading since the revival of astrology happened onlywith the translations from Arabic sources in thelaterMiddle Ages (cf. Thorndike,History,vol.i,551–782).80Laistner, “Western Church and Astrology,”263,265.81The allusion is to the famous but half-hearted one-page article by Neugebauer, “The Study ofWretched Subjects,” published in the journalIsisin1951. Although Neugebauer criticized GeorgeSarton’s characterization of the Mandaean “Book of the Zodiak” as “a wretched collection of omens,debased astrology and miscellaneous nonsense” and the whole field as “the superstitious flotsam ofthe Near East,” he himself also remained under the spell of the medieval Christian categorization ofastrology assuperstitio(as shown by his characterization of Sarton’s language as “factually correct,”and his adoption of similar language in the rest of the article).

Although Isidore, too, had ranged thevarious kinds of divination under “magic” and condemned all of them asinvolving contact with demons,82in his section on “astronomy” he had alsodistinguished betweenastrologia superstitiosaand an acceptableastrologianaturalis.83Only a very small step was required to apply a similar distinctionto the category of magic as a whole, and argue that the demon-ridden andidolatrous practices known under that name should not be confused withthe legitimate study of the workings of nature:magia naturalis.Thisnewterm should therefore be understoodnotas an attempt to present magicas scientific, but as an apologetic concept intended to protect the study ofthe ancient sciences against theological censure.Among the earliest authors to use this new terminology was the Parisianbishop William of Auvergne (Guillelmus Alvernus) in the thirteenthcentury, and it had become well established by the end of the fourteenth.84Significantly, William’s assertion that part of the domain known as “magic”was actually concerned with the legitimate study of natural processeswent hand in hand with a renewed, and extremely formulated, emphasison pagan idolatry as its demonic counterpart that must be exterminated“with fire and sword.”85For the later development of the debate onmagic, it is highly important that the same author was responsible forreviving the memory of Augustine’s largely forgotten condemnation of the“godmaking passages” in the hermeticAsclepius, where Hermes praisedthe ancient Egyptian practice of creating statues and drawing the souls ofdivine entities down into them.86In intellectual debate since William ofAuvergne and throughout the Renaissance,Asclepius23–24/37–38becamea virtually unavoidablelocus classicusfor discussions of “astral magic” (thedrawing down of “powers” or “virtues” from the stars), or, more specifically,the use of astrological images or talismans.87If talismans were intendedto be “addressed”88to some kind of spirit or intelligence, associated with a82Isidore of Seville,Etymologiae8.9; cf.

However, if the image derived its virtuesolely from the natural powers of the stars, as suggested in the extremelyinfluential thirteenth-centurySpeculum Astronomiae, it could be acceptedas natural magic.89As explained by Nicolas Weill-Parot, the distinctionis one of semiology versus etiology:90illicit magic depended on signsaddressed to intelligences, whereas licit natural magic depended on chainsof causality in a naturalistic framework.This basic opposition was part of the strict classifications typical ofscholastic rationality, and developed in paradigmatic fashion by ThomasAquinas.91While legitimating natural magic in principle, it neverthelessforced its defenders into a defensive position, for they always needed toconvince theological critics that what they claimed were natural processesdid not actually involve some “addressative” and hence illicit dimension.However, alternative neoplatonizing theoretical frameworks coming fromthe Islamic world, such as, notably, al-Kindi’sDe radiis(available in Latinsince the thirteenth century) implied exactly the opposite logic, as explainedby Weill-Parot: since all events were supposed to be governed by the uni-versal celestial harmony and connected by a network of invisible “rays,”the efficacy of magic depended on natural processesevenif the practitionerbelieved himself to be addressing demons!92De radiisis among the majorinfluences on Marsilio Ficino’s novel Renaissance understanding of nat-ural magic as working by means of the universalspiritus(described as a“very tenuous” intermediary substance, more soul-like than the body butmore bodily than the soul, and permeating the whole of reality);93and89Speculum Astronomiae11(in: Zambelli,Speculum Astronomiae,246–247); and the extensive discus-sion in Weill-Parot,Les “images astrologiques”,27–90.90Weill-Parot, “Astral Magic,”176.91See discussion in Weill-Parot,Les “images astrologiques,”223–259.92Weill-Parot, “Astral Magic,”177–178; and extensively in Weill-Parot,Les “images astrologiques,”155–174.

It is therefore hardly surprising that the phenomenonknown as Renaissance magic, beginning with Ficino, is characterized byprofound ambiguities on the theoretical level: drawing on a great variety ofLatin, Greek and Arabic sources, it had to combine aristotelian with pla-tonic strands of natural philosophy and metaphysics, it needed to presentboth of them as compatible with Christian doctrine, it had to convince thetheologians that magic was strictly natural, but nevertheless, it also wantedto see that same natural magic as the supremereligiouswisdom derivedfrom Zoroaster!94As remarked by Jean-Pierre Brach, the Renaissance saw a series of famousattempts at theorizing and systematizing magic against the background ofthe scholastic distinction between natural and ritual (angelic or demonic)magic, but “the elaboration of a synthetic approach had, in many cases,the not-so-paradoxical effect of partially blurring the basic differences thatwere assumed to exist between them.”95This ambiguity is already evidentin the case of Ficino, whose main discussion of “natural” (that is, astral)magic took the form, very significantly, of a crypto-commentary on thehermetic “god-making passages” which, as we have seen, had been pre-cisely the paradigm of idolatrous magic since William of Auvergne.96Inthe wake of Pico della Mirandola’s magical theses, it was strongly enhancedby a tendency of associating magic with kabbalah, sometimes to a pointwhere they became virtually identical.97With Cornelius Agrippa’s famousDe occulta philosophia(originally meant to be titledDe magia) this devel-opment reached its logical conclusion. Magic was explicitly presented hereas the “ancient wisdom,” whose reputation needed to be purified fromthe common association with illicit practices of evil sorcery, superstition,94Zambelli,L’ambigua natura della magia; Weill-Parot, “Astral Magic,”178–179; and for the com-plexity of Ficino’s talismanic magic and its sources, see in particular Weill-Parot, “P ́enombreFicinienne.”95Brach, “Magic IV,”732.96Hanegraaff, “Lodovico Lazzarelli,”73n.193. The crucial point was whether the beneficial “gifts”drawn down from the stars by means of astral magic were in fact demonic, in line with Augustine’scensure ofAsclepius23–24/37–38, or natural, as suggested by a closely equivalent passage in Plotinus’Ennead4.3.11.De Vita Coelitus Comparandawas presented as a commentary on the latter (title abovechapter I, see Kaske and Clark ed.,242–243), but any well-informed reader would have recognizedthe parallel with the notoriousAsclepiuspassage, and Ficino himself made it explicit in his chapter26.77–89(Kaske and Clark ed.,388–389).97See, for example, Pico’s Magical thesis9>15(Farmer,Syncretism,498–499): “No magical operationcan be of any efficacy unless it has annexed to it a work of Kabbalah, explicit or implicit.” Cf.discussion in Brach, “Magic IV,”733."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"176The error of historyand demonism.98Agrippa adopted Reuchlin’s categorization of thearsmiraculorumas consisting of three levels (physics, astrology, and magic,the latter subdivided into a negativegoetiaand a positivetheurgia),99buthe mademagiainto the umbrella term, subdividing it into (1) “naturalmagic,” concerned with the sublunar world of the elements, (2)“celes-tial magic,” pertaining to the realm above the moon but below the fixedstars, and mostly concerned with numbers and astrology, and (3)“cere-monial magic,” concerned with demonic and angelic entities above thefixed stars, and dominated by kabbalah. The brilliance of this scheme wasthat it could encompass all the ancient materials that were now available,while assigning to each discipline its proper place in an orderly hierar-chy: from the natural arts and sciences recovered from Arabic sources,via the religious speculations attributed to the ancient sages in Greekmanuscripts, to the supreme Mosaic revelations known as kabbalah fromthe Hebrew sources. Extremely influential through the following cen-turies, Agrippa’s scheme reflects his awareness that, while a distinctionbetween “good” and “bad” magic remained crucial, the termmagia natu-raliswas no longer convincing as a general term for the former category:the ancientmageialinked to the name of Zoroaster was too obviouslyconcerned with metaphysical realities, not just physical ones, and its trueorigin was the kabbalistic revelation coming from the Creator himself. Inshort, even if many authors kept referring tomagia naturalis,infacttherewas no real distinction any more between aprisca theologiaand apriscamagia.The “metamorphosis of magic”100from late antiquity to early modernityis a remarkable phenomenon, somewhat reminiscent of the beggar whobecame a millionaire. Notwithstanding some vague claims of a remoteand noble ancestry, it had begun its life as a wholly negative term fordespicable demonic and idolatrous practices; in due time, however, it hadmanaged to gain a degree of respectability by setting itself off sharplyagainst its former identity, asmagia naturalis; and once having carved outthat securer niche for itself, it finally set out to conquer the world byproclaiming itself universal, all-encompassing, and related to the HighestGood. Once having attained its highest reputation by the sixteenth centuryamong certain circles of humanist intellectuals, it became a natural target98For example, Agrippa,De occulta philosophia, “Ad lectorem” and dedication to Trithemius (PerroneCompagni ed.,65–71).99Reuchlin,De verbo mirificoBk.2(Ehlerset al.ed.,142–143); and see Perrone Compagni, “Intro-duction,”17–18.100Bremmer and Veenstra,Metamorphosis of Magic."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Tainted terminologies 3: occult177for critics. Many of them kept calling attention to its doubtful origins,suggesting that its splendid garb was just a show, and the old heart ofdarkness was still beating underneath. Others suggested that it was over-reaching itself, and should be satisfied with a respectable existence limitedto the realm of nature. But even though it gradually began to concedemuch of its power to competitors from the seventeenth century on, andwas finally ridiculed as a fool and a fraud after the eighteenth, ever sinceits Renaissance moment of glory there have been those (as will be seen)who kept on believing in its superior spiritual mission, and in the authorityderived from its ancient nobility.This complicated career explains much of the confused status of “magic”since the period of the Enlightenment: the term could mean very differentthings to different parties, and each participant in the discourse had a widechoice of connotations to highlight or play down at will, according tohis particular religious, scientific, or philosophical agenda. However, thegeneral playing field in which these discussions took place was the onesketched in the introduction to this chapter: since the later seventeenthcentury, it was always concerned with the status of “nature” and its relationto the divine, and, more particularly, the question of whether science leftany room for the presence of “spiritual” forces or entities in the naturalworld. Within that context, the concept of “natural magic” came to play acentral rolebecauseof its profound ambiguity: it could be used to disenchantthe world by claiming that magic was really just a natural phenomenon, butit could also be used to re-enchant the world by claiming that nature wasinherently “magical” (now in the sense of being permeated by mysteriousforces). Most confusing of all, the former argument could turn out to bea Trojan horse: an author might stress his agreement with naturalists thatmagic was just another term for natural philosophy, only to continue byendowing “nature” with all the invisible forces and presences otherwiseassociated with the supernatural and the demonic!

The same istrue for the ancient sciences more generally. One has to wait until theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries to observe the process, which shouldbegin to sound familiar by now, of such theological censure being translatedinto scientific terms. In order to understand that development, we now haveto turn to a third key term: the adjectiveoccult(literally: hidden, concealed)and its cognates.At the very origin of this terminology, we find the common recognitionthat there are certain forces and connections in nature that remain invisi-ble or “hidden,” and are bound to strike us as mysterious because they arehard to account for in rational terms. Although we are no longer used tothinking about phenomena such as the power of the magnet, the force ofgravity, or even the ability of our mind to move our body, as mysteriousor occult forces, a philosopher like David Hume in the eighteenth centurywas still perfectly aware of the connection, and made a point of emphasiz-ing that the ideas of “power, force, energy, or necessary connection” were“more obscure and uncertain” than any other.101His very terminology wentback, once again, to the science and philosophy of Greek antiquity, wheresuch “hidden” forces were discussed notably by means of the concepts of\u001d\u0013\u001a\u0011\u001f\r\u0007and$\u001a\u000b\u0003\f\r\u0011(to which we owe our “dynamics” and “energy”),\u0018\u0013\u001f%\u0017\u0012\f\r\u0011and&\u001a\u0005\r%\u0017\u0012\f\r\u0011(sympathy and antipathy), and the peculiarnotion of'\u001d\r\t\u0005\u0004\u0005\f\u0007 \u0002\u0003\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\r.102Literally meaning “unspeakable quali-ties,” the adjective had a double set of connotations, roughly similar tocontemporary usage: “unexplainable” or “unnatural” on the one hand, and“morally reprehensible,” “horrible,” or “abnormal” on the other.103Accord-ing to Julius R ̈ohr,'\u001d\r\t\u0005\u0004\u0005\f\u0007 \u0002\u0003\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\rwas used more exclusively than theother terms for forces in nature that we would nowadays tend to see as101Hume,Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding7.49(part of the chapter “On the Idea of Neces-sary Connexion”). The elusiveness of the concept of “force” is captured very nicely by a quotationfrom the nineteenth-century philosopher Otto Liebmann: “Kr ̈afte sind Kausalgespenster, aberreale, nicht imagin ̈are” (“Forces are phantoms of causality, but they are real, not imaginary”:ZurAnalysis der Wirklichkeit,287). Note that apart from invisible “forces” connecting causes and effects,non-causal connections usually referred to as “correspondences” fall under the “occult” umbrellaas well (cf. n.110, below), and can be traced from ancient concepts of “sympathy/antipathy” and“macrocosm/microcosm” to rationalist theories in Enlightenment thinking. A particularly instruc-tive example of how correspondences could be developed as a rational (definitely not “mystical”)concept in post-Cartesian natural philosophy is Emanuel Swedenborg in his scientific phase, a fewyears before Hume’sEnquiry: see hisClavis Hieroglyphica(1741or1742), and analysis in Hanegraaff,Swedenborg, Oetinger, Kant,3–11.102The indispensable reference, with copious quotations for all the relevant terms, remains R ̈ohr,Derokkulte Kraftbegriff im Altertum.103Ibid.,101."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Tainted terminologies 3: occult179“occult”;104and it was probably as a translation of this specific terminologythat the crucial medieval concept ofqualitates occultae(occult qualities)emerged in a scholastic context, closely connected with the peripateticconcept of “substantial form,” during the later Middle Ages.105The key importance of “occult qualities” to the history of science has beenclearly demonstrated in recent scholarship, and almost every contributorhas warned against anachronistic confusion with modern ideas about “theoccult” or “occultism.”106In the medieval reception of aristotelian naturalphilosophy, a distinction was made between the manifest, directly observ-able qualities of things (such as colors or tastes), and their occult qualities,which were not directly observable and therefore could not be accountedfor in terms of the four elements. Many important natural effects of whichthe reality was not in doubt – such as magnetic and electrostatic attrac-tion, the curative virtues of specific herbal, animal or mineral substances,or the influences of the sun and moon – were impossible to account for interms of the primary elemental qualities (moist/dry, warm/cold) and theirmixtures or combinations. Their efficient cause therefore had to be some“hidden” (occult) quality: hidden not only because the senses could notperceive it, but, even more importantly, because it was beyond the reachof scientific investigation altogether. The reason was that, by definition,occult qualities could only be studied indirectly through their effects, butnot directly as causes, as required by medievalscientia. This made theminto the black box of scholastic science: a necessary part of the technicalapparatus, but also a reminder that God had set limits to man’s curiosity.107104Ibid.,96.105Ibid.,96and105(notwithstanding R ̈ohr’s careful distinctions betweenqualitas,potentia,andproprietas occulta).

On ThomasAquinas and substantial form, cf. Blum, “Qualitates occultae,”50–51.106As observed by Ignaz Wild in his pioneering article of1907(mostly consisting of quotationsfrom Latin sources), “in the eighteenth century . . . the true meaning of the expression [qualitatesoccultae] was no longer known, and misguided opinions are still reflected in current historiography”(“Zur Geschichte der Qualitates Occultae,”344). Few specialists of scholasticism even knew theexpression, except as a “scientific term of abuse” (ibid.,307–308). Although Lynn Thorndikediscussed the role of “occult virtues” in all the eight volumes of hismagnum opus,theywereputback on the agenda due to a provocative article by Keith Hutchison in1982(“What happenedto Occult Qualities”), followed by John Henry in1986(“Occult Qualities”), both focused onthe scientific revolution.

The reason is that it provided a cogentscientific argument for claiming that many “wondrous” or “marvelous”phenomena of nature, which the common people tended to attribute todemonic or supernatural agency, were in fact purely natural. In other words:far from suggesting an “occultist” worldview according to modern under-standings of that term, it was originally an instrument for disenchantment,used to withdraw the realm of the marvelous from theological control andmake it available for scientific study. To theological critics, however, theconcept might look like a Trojan horse, for if it could account for unques-tionable realities such as magnetic attraction or the connection betweenthe moon and the tides, it could be used quite as easily to legitimatemore doubtful influences, such as those emanating from the stars – notto mention an enormous range of other “occult” powers, such as the evileye, monstrous births caused by theimaginatio, or “sympathetic” cures atdistance, like the famous weapon salve.108In principle, all these strange andmarvelous phenomena could now be seen as legitimate objects of scientificresearch, and they did indeed become a major preoccupation of scientistsin the early modern period.The emergence of the concepts of “occult philosophy” and the “occultsciences” during the sixteenth century becomes not just understandable,but almost predictable against these backgrounds. We have seen that, inthe wake of the platonic revival, the original concept ofmagia naturalisunknowable by definition (their confinement in an “asylum of ignorance,” as famously formulatedby Julius Caesar Scaliger in1557and often repeated since then; see Blum, “Qualitates occultae,”58and nn.44–45) was unacceptable to the new science of the seventeenth century. Far fromrejecting occult qualities, as has traditionally been assumed by historians of science, philosophersand scientists in the wake of Descartes were arguing that they could and should be made into anobject of research, and sought to account for them in mechanical terms (cf. d’Alembert’s positivenotion of “physique occulte” in the entry on experimental method in theEncyclop ́edie:d’Alembert,“Exp ́erimental,”298;cf.Thorndike,“L’Encyclop ́edie,”379). Even more than that, they rejected“manifest qualities” and argued thatallqualities were occult, but nevertheless knowable!108For a provocative discussion of Renaissance magic focused particularly on these dimensions, seeCouliano,Eros and Magic. On the powers attributed to theimaginatio, see van den Doel andHanegraaff, “Imagination.” For the “sympathetic” cure and its remarkable tenacity in seriousmedical debate, see, for example, van den Elsen, “The Rotterdam Sympathy Case.” The mostfamous example of sympathetic treatment was the weapon salve, for example the belief thatwounds could be cured at distance by treating the weapon that had caused them; but it could takemany other forms, as in the controversy of1696–1697(analyzed by van den Elsen) around HenricusGeorgius Reddewitz, who claimed to have cured patients in their absence, by stirring a “secretpowder” in their urine.

Furthermore, in the first chapter we saw how –particularly under the influence of Pico della Mirandola and his Christiankabbalah – references to secrecy and concealment became increasinglyprominent within the same discourse of ancient wisdom, culminating,again, in Agrippa’s notion ofocculta philosophia:109the hidden philosophyof the ancients, now revealed to the Christian world. And finally, Pico was atthe origin of a strong Renaissance revival of “correlative thinking,” focusingon the notion of hidden non-causal correspondences (as distinct fromhidden causal connections) between all parts of reality.110It was practicallyinevitable that the traditional notion of mysterious “hidden” powers thatare somehow “secretly” at work in nature would now be expanded andtransformed together with the original notion ofmagia naturalis,sothatfrom the black box of scholastic naturalism they became the privilegedsanctuary of divine mystery in the world.This subtle but important process of conceptual transformationamounted, in other words, to a re-enchantment ofmagia naturalis.Howthe term “occult” could transmute from technical scholastic terminologyinto something closer to current understandings of the word may be illus-trated by many examples. For instance, Giovanni Battista della Porta, inthe first edition of hisMagia Naturalis(1558), discussed the occult qualitiesas follows:They are occult and hidden because they cannot be known with certainty by wayof demonstration. This is why the ancient sages considered it good to establish acertain limit, beyond which one cannot pass in researching the reasons of things.Since in Nature there are many inner sanctuaries, hidden and full of energy, whosecauses the conjecture of the human mind can neither search out nor understand.109SeeChapter1,pp.64–68. The term “occulta philosophia” was picked up by various authors laterin the sixteenth century: a pseudo-paracelsianOcculta philosophiawas printed in1570, followed byseveral other works under that title, and by1600the term was also commonly used as a synonymfor alchemy (Telle, “Astrologie und Alchemie,”242–243,withn.64). It also appears, for example,in the subtitle of Campanella’sDe sensu rerum et magia.110Concepts of “occult causality” assume the existence of some kind of hidden medium by whichinfluences are transmitted from cause to effect (for example al-Kindi’s “rays”), whereas concepts of“correspondence” assume that things can be connected by some kind of pre-established harmony,without a need for mediating forces (see, for example, Plotinus,Ennead4.4.41–42). Already inFicino’sDe Vita Coelitus Comparandawe find mixtures between the two concepts (Kaske andClark, “Introduction,”48–49), and “correlative thinking” became a fundamental notion in the“occulta philosophia” beginning with Pico della Mirandola (Farmer,Syncretism in the West,18–29,91–96; cf.

However, he also uses it to refertoqualitates occultae, and more generally to the “most occult and inti-mate secrets of nature.”112In so doing, he was merely repeating a commonmedieval topos;113but of considerable importance is the fact that he maywell have been the first author to refer to sciences concerned with thosesecrets of nature asoccult sciences.114He does this within a more generalcontext entirely dominated by the ancient wisdom narrative and its centralauthors; and under the explicit influence of Agrippa’sDe occulta philosophia,the term “occult” now suggests religious mysteries hidden from the vulgarbut revealed to the wise as “higher knowledge.”115From that perspective,Kabbalah, Magic, and Alchemy are presented by de Vigen`ere as the three“occult and secret sciences” (occasionally also “mystical sciences”),116andhe was evidently thinking of them in terms of Agrippa’s “three worlds”:“May nobody be scandalized by these appellations, which have such abad reputation everywhere, and are so much abused.

It is of critical importanceto understand that, in this framework, it was much more than just apragmatic umbrella category for covering a range of otherwise diverse andrelatively autonomous sciences. On the contrary: from the outset, the termimplied an underlying, “hidden” unity and coherence, ultimately groundedin the “ancient wisdom” (of Hermes Trismegistus in particular). Seenmerely “from the outside,” the domains of magic, astrology, kabbalah, andalchemy might look like relatively distinct disciplines; however, referringto them as “occult sciences” carried the deliberate suggestion that theywere unified at a deeper level, because they reflected one and the same,comprehensive, hidden, but universal knowledge about the true natureof reality. A particularly clear example of this perspective comes from theParacelsian G ́erard Dorn (1584):Adam was the first inventor of theartes, because he possessed knowledge of allthings, both before and after the Flood . . . His successors drew up two stone tablets,on which they inscribed all the natural arts, in hieroglyphic characters . . . Afterthe Flood, Noah . . . found one of these tablets under mount Ararat. It showed thecourse of the superior firmament, and of the inferior globe, and of the planets.Finally, being divided into different parts, this universal knowledge was diminishedin power, and as an effect of this separation, one [person] became an astronomer,anotheramagus,yetanotheroneakabbalist,andthefourthanalchemist...Themonarchy of the truearteswas divided up into diverse and various democracies,that is, into astronomy, magic, kabbalah, alchemy, etcetera. But in their perfectform they all came from one single fountain of truth, and from the knowledge ofthe two lights, natural and supernatural.118Understood from such unifying perspectives, the various “occult sciences”eventually came to be presented, polemically and apologetically, as alterna-tives to the normal, non-occult sciences: by way of contrast, the latter couldthen be dismissed as relatively superficial pursuits concerned merely withthe external surface of things, but blind to their deeper spiritual essence.At the same time, the concept of a “unity of the occult sciences” was quiteacceptable for opponents as well, even welcome, for they could use it tothe celestial world, and kabbalah to the supercelestial world. On128v, de Vigen`ere defends his useof the term “magic” for the celestial world, describing it as “the natural and licit occult philosophy:definitely not that detestable acquaintance and commerce of evil spirits that one has wanted tocolor with the name of magic, where there are only shadows and confusion.”118Dorn,In Theophrasti Paracelsi Aurorum philosophorum,10–11,16; see Mandosio, “La place del’alchimie,”280–281."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"184The error of historyoppose them wholesale against “real” science. We will encounter manyexamples further on in this chapter.Of course, the term “occult sciences” is common in modern scholarshipas well, as a convenient shorthand category for astrology, alchemy, andnatural magic, occasionally expanded so as to include witchcraft. But itis important to emphasize that, whether intentionally or not, any suchusage still implies the unifying perspective inherited from the Renaissanceproject ofocculta philosophia: after all, these sciences or practices are classedtogether only because all of them are seen as “occult.” This, of course, begsthe question of what that means for modern scholars. How convincing is theassumption of unity? What are its underlying assumptions? And what areits effects on our ways of studying the phenomena in question? It is fair tosay that modern scholars and critics have very rarely asked themselves thesequestions, let alone answered them. Rather, they have tended to take thecategory for granted, usually on the basis of an implicit (often unconscious)acceptance of “magic” as a universal categorysui generis. A classic exampleis Keith Thomas’ celebratedReligion and the Decline of Magic(1971), whichmade a point of emphasizing “the unity of magical beliefs” such as astrology,alchemy, witchcraft, natural magic, and the various divinatory arts.119Ina truly extreme form, the modernist bias underlying that perspective canbe studied in Wayne Shumaker’s much-quoted studyThe Occult Sciencesin the Renaissance(1972).120But by far the most explicit and sustaineddefense of the “unity of the occult sciences,” understood as the essentiallyirrational and superstitious counterpart to reason and science, comes froma contemporary scholar of English literature and history of science, BrianVickers. As formulated by him in1988:There are sufficient internal resemblances among astrology, alchemy, numerology,iatromathematics, and natural magic for one to be able to describe the occult119Thomas,Religion and the Decline of Magic,755–761(and cf.767for the motifs of “closed system”and “resistance to change”: “Such systems of belief possess a resilience which makes them virtuallyimmune to external argument”).120It is hard to find a scholar who expresses his contempt for anything “occult” as explicitly asShumaker. If Keith Thomas famously claimed in his foreword that “Astrology, witchcraft, mag-ical healing, divination, ancient prophecies, ghosts and fairies, are now all rightly disdained byintelligent persons” (Religion and the Decline of Magic, ix), Shumaker went as far as stating thatanyone holding such beliefs today was “the victim of some special psychological need” (OccultSciences, xiv,7), and kept emphasizing their status as “delusions,” the prominence of which inearly modern thinking had “shocked” him (Occult Sciences, xiv, cf.198). Shumaker’s study mustbe seen against the background of his moral concerns about the contemporary “crisis” of societyand the resurgence of the occult among his students, reflective of the1960s counterculture (OccultSciences, xiii, xv). That Shumaker’s perspective remained essentially unchanged is clear from theextreme whiggishness and anachronistic reasoning that pervades hisNatural Magic and ModernScience(1989)."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Tainted terminologies 3: occult185sciences as forming a unified system. They all invoke a distinction between thevisible and invisible worlds; they all depend on the designation of symbols relatingto this dichotomy; they all make great use of analogies, correspondences, andrelations among apparently discrete elements in man and the universe. As a systemthe occult sciences were imported into Greece from various oriental cultures,and were systematically codified in the Hellenistic period, following the deathof Alexander in323bc. Once codified they retained their essential assumptionsand methodology through the Middle Ages, into the Renaissance, and beyond –indeed, one of the most remarkable features of the occult tradition is its staticnature, its resistance to change.121It would seem, then, that Vickers does not see the alleged “unity of theoccult sciences” as a relatively recent phenomenon grounded in the Renais-sance synthesis from Ficino through Agrippa, but as one that can be tracedall the way back to its origins in the ancient Near East. However, such animpression would ultimately be misleading, for, in its essence, “the occult”according to Vickers is not a historical phenomenon at all, but a universaltendency of the human mind. In all his publications on the subject, heargues that the fundamental unity, homogeneity, continuity, and “resis-tance to change” of the occult sciences is based upon a basic “mentality,”which they share with non-scriptural cultures studied by anthropologists.In short, the occult sciences are grounded not in experimentation, explana-tory theories, or even just ideas, but in abiding pre-rational mental habitsthat are structurally similar to those of “primitive” peoples. This is why theyare not supposed to change and develop, as science does. Vickers makes astrong plea for the use of anthropological categories in the study of history,and mentions a range of authorities; but as pointed out by Patrick Curry,his approach is based essentially on what was highlighted above as oneof the three basic theoretical approaches to “magic,” Lucien L ́evy-Bruhl’stheory of “participation” versus “causality.”122In sharp contrast with the121Vickers, “Function of Analogy,”265; on the same page, see Vickers’ emphasis on the “fundamentalhomogeneity and continuity” of the occult sciences. Vickers’ two other major statements onthe topic were published four years earlier in his edited volumeOccult and Scientific Mentalities(“Introduction”; “Analogy versus Identity”).122Curry, “Revisions of Science and Magic,”307. For Vickers’ anthropological references, see “Intro-duction,”32–43, with long discussions of Robin Horton and Ernest Gellner. Vickers refers toRobin Horton for describing science and the occult as respectively “open” and “closed” systems,but as pointed out by Curry (ibid.,306; referring to Horton,Patterns,319), Horton himself haseventually rejected that dichotomy as “ripe for the scrap heap.” Vickers’ reception of L ́evy-Bruhl’stheories seems mostly indirect, through authors such as Stanley Tambiah (Vickers, “Analogyversus Identity,”96–97; “Function of Analogy,”280). Note that the notion of “resistance tochange” is an anthropological clich ́esocommonastobesharedevenbyL ́evy-Bruhl’s opponentMalinowski: “Follow one rite, study one spell, grasp the principles of magical belief, art and soci-ology in one case, and . . . adding a variant here or there, you will be able to settle as a magicalpractitioner in any part of the world” (“Magic, Science and Religion,”70)."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"186The error of historyinstrumental causality basic to rational science, the occult sciences havetheir foundation, according to Vickers, in thereification of symbols andanalogies: that is to say, the tendency of the human mind to project meremental connections into the real world, and confuse linguistic signs withtheir signified objects.123The result is a view of the world as permeated bynon-causal correspondences (reified analogies), in sharp contrast with theinstrumental causality basic to science.124Accordingly, Vickers concludes,there can be no question of any historical influence of the “occult sciences”on the development of real science:125on the contrary, science is basedupon “the rejection of occult symbolism.”This stringent application of the traditional “magic versus science” argu-ment to the historiography of science has been sharply attacked by rep-resentatives of the “new historiography” in these fields,126who reject it asa fundamentally anachronistic and unhistorical perspective out of touchwith current scholarship.127If the “occult sciences” are really a homo-geneous unity, there would seem to be no point in seeking to differentiatebetween its various manifestations or studying their historical developmentin detail.

The “new historiography of alchemy” (Principe, “Reflections”; Vickers,“The ‘New Historiography’”) is representative of a wider phenomenon, and the notion is thereforeexpanded here so as to include new approaches to the study of astrology (see, for example,Newman and Grafton,Secrets of Nature) and natural magic. It represents an important “paradigmchange” in the historiography of science, as reflected emblematically in the removal, in2002,ofthe category “pseudosciences” from the classification scheme of the famous “Current Bibliographyof the History of Science” in the leading scholarly journal for the history of scienceIsis(Weldon,“Table of Contents & Introduction”). The new scheme has separate categories for “Occult sciencesand magic,” “Astrology,” and “Alchemy.”127Newman, “Brian Vickers,”483,502. Vickers’ defense against the charge of anachronistic “Whig”reasoning can be found in the final paragraph of an article published in German in1988(“KritischeReaktionen,”226–229) but deleted from the English version in1992(“Critical Reactions”).128Newman and Grafton, “Introduction,”26; Newman,Promethean Ambitions,54; Newman, “BrianVickers,”488–491,502; Kahn,Alchimie et Paracelsisme,2,8–9,11.

Again, if the specificity of the “occult sciences” according to Vick-ers resides in a basic mentality typical of “primitive thought,” not in anyrational attempt at studying and understanding the natural world, and ifthis mentality is merely the result of conceptual confusion and delusionarymental projections, then they cannot possibly be seen as relevant to thehistory of science: they will never be more than “proto-scientific” deadends, or “pseudo-sciences” pure and simple. But recent scholarship haspointed out again and again that, contrary to popular assumptions, eachof the disciplines in question has been deeply and centrally concerned withrational models of causality and empirical study of the natural world, andthat they have made significant contributions to the history of what weconsider as science today.129Furthermore, as correctly noted by Newman,Vickers’ argument is strictly identical with that of Edward Burnett Tylorin his famous definition of “magic” as based upon “mistaking an ideal fora real connexion.”130Against the background of my previous discussions,this in itself suffices to expose Vickers’ construct of “occult sciences” as yetanother example of the common but deeply ironic phenomenon of a “mag-ical” reification of mental concepts by the very scholars who believe thatthey are doing the opposite.131For exactly the same reasons as “magic,” then,the concept of “occult sciences” must indeed be rejected as valid scholarlyterminology. It forces very different historical phenomena into the strait-jacket of an artificial and reductivesui generisconcept, thereby causingus to lose sight of their actual complexity and development over time. Itfalsely suggests that the disciplines in question have no interest in empiricalobservation or experimentation, and that they refuse to recognize causalconnections because their deep involvement in pre-rational, “primitive”modes of thought allegedly makes them blind to any genuinely scientificconcerns.132In short: by calling them “occult sciences,” scholars inevitably129Representative are the many recent studies by Newman and Principe (for example, Newman,Gehennical Fire; Newman,Promethean Ambitions; Newman and Principe,Alchemy Tried in theFire;Principe,Aspiring Adept).

Newman (“Brian Vickers,”502) ends his article with drawing exactly thesame conclusion: “In Vickers’ work on the occult we have a striking example of the very reificationof mental concepts that forms the central subject of his own complaint.”132The mistake is identical with the one committed by Malinowski in his famous critique of L ́evy-Bruhl, who was supposed to have claimed that “primitive man has no sober moods at all, that he ishopelessly and completely immersed in a mystical frame of mind.

But as happens so often in the heat of “scien-tific revolutions,” there is always a risk of throwing out some babies withthe bathwater. Vickers’ suggestion that representatives of the “new histo-riography” are “apologists” for the occult sciences confuses partisanshipwith the legitimate defense of a field of study against hostile and distort-ing interpretations;134but admittedly, in their zeal for getting fields likeastrology and alchemy back on the core agenda of history of science, the“new historians” sometimes overshoot the mark. In Newman and Grafton’sdefense for the independence of astrology and alchemy, one cannot helpnoticing a certain degree of impatience with the “occult philosophy” of theRenaissance, held responsible for the “hackneyed” thesis of a “unity of theoccult sciences,” and constantly evoked by scholars of “the Hermetic Tra-dition” since Frances Yates in the1960s.135One understands the irritationof specialists about how that perspective still dominates any discussion inthe field, even when it comes to medieval astrology or alchemy.136Never-theless, there was certainly a very widespread concern in the sixteenthand seventeenth centuries with integrating astrology, alchemy, and naturalmagic, along with such fields as kabbalah and number symbolism, as partsreasoning’ . . . unable to draw any benefit from experience, to construct or comprehend even themost elementary laws of nature” (“Magic, Science and Religion,”25). Malinowski’s refutationof that thesis, by demonstrating that the Trobriand Islanders showed an acute understanding ofnatural law while fishing or hunting, was directed against a straw man, for the summary is acaricature of L ́evy-Bruhl’s work, and “instrumental causality” and “participation” are not mutuallyexclusive but can easily coexist (see discussion in Hanegraaff, “How Magic Survived,”371–378).133Vickers could respond with a variation on Tylor’s view of magic as proto-science: “the very reasonwhy magic is almost all bad is because when any of it becomes good it ceases to be magic” (Tylor,“Magic,”206; for the importance of this neglected article, see Hanegraaff, “Emergence of theAcademic Science of Magic,”262–265). The occult sciences would then be not scientific, becausewhen anything in them becomes scientific, it automatically ceases to be occult. But this would notsave Vickers’ argument, for if so, we are no longer dealing with “occult sciences” as an umbrellaconcept: instead, “occult” becomes a simple synonym for “unscientific,” resulting in an emptytautology.134Vickers, “The ‘New Historiography’,”144,154; Newman, “Brian Vickers,”482–484.135Newman and Grafton, “Introduction,”21,26: “Even during the heyday of Renaissance neo-platonism, astrology and alchemy lived independent lives, despite the vast inkwells devoted to therhetorical embellishment of occult philosophy.” Newman,Promethean Ambitions,44,54:“Thehackneyed modern view that automatically equates alchemy with witchcraft, necromancy, and apotpourri of other practices and theories loosely labeled ‘the occult’ has little historical validitybefore the nineteenth century.” On Yates and her approach, seeChapter4,323–334.136Newman, “Technology and Alchemical Debate,”425: medieval alchemy was “a perfectly reasonableand sober offshoot of Aristotle’s theory of matter,” as opposed to “the eclectic, Neoplatonic alchemyof the Renaissance, suffused with theosophy and cabalism.” Cf.

In a historiography that wishesto avoid essentialism, theocculta philosophiaproject of the Renaissancejust cannot be dismissed as marginal to what astrology or alchemy were“really” about: rather, it must be studied as an important historical phe-nomenon that resulted in creative and extremely influential new ways ofunderstanding these disciplines and their relationship to one another.138Ifthis somewhat blurs their fresh scientific image in the context of the “newhistoriography,” so be it.If Vickers’ complex of reified analogy, symbolism, and correspondences(in short, “analogical thinking”)139cannot be used to define a unified con-cept of “occult sciences,” what then is the nature of its relation to thefields of astrology, alchemy, and natural magic? Nobody denies that theydo have their roots in an ancient Hellenistic culture permeated by belief inhidden correspondences and analogical thinking; as “textually cumulativedisciplines”140they clearly retained those dimensions as a vital part of theirtheoretical apparatus; and as we have seen, there is no doubt at all thatsuch analogical modes of thought experienced an enormous boost in thewake – again – of the Platonizing tendencies of the Renaissanceoccultaphilosophia. Nor does the “new historiography” deny these facts: for exam-ple, Lawrence Principe calls specific attention to the doctrine of similitudesin medieval works like Pseudo-Arnaud of Vilanova’sTractatus parabolicus137This is correctly pointed out not only by Vickers (“The ‘New Historiography’,”130) but evenby Newman and Grafton themselves: they trace the “unifying” perspective to authors like Ficino,Agrippa, and Elias Ashmole (“Introduction,”24–26), thereby contradicting Newman’s own thesisthat it is a modern nineteenth-century invention.138At issue here is the risk of an implicit essentialism even among strong and explicit defenders ofstrictly historical research: see discussion, with reference to a different but strictly comparable fieldof research, in Hanegraaff, “Origins of Occultist Kabbalah.” Gershom Scholem’s refusal to takethe study of occultist and contemporary kabbalah seriously (Huss, “Ask No Questions”) stood insharp conflict to his explicit historical methodology.139There is no agreement even about basic terminological conventions in this extremely complexdomain of overlapping concepts, speculative systems, worldviews, and mental habits. Alterna-tive terms are, for example, “correspondences” (see overview in Brach and Hanegraaff, “Corre-spondences”), “correlative thinking” (Needham,Science and Civilization; Farmer, Henderson andWitzel, “Neurobiology, Layered Texts, and Correlative Cosmologies”), “ressemblance” (Foucault,Les mots et les choses), “participation” (L ́evy-Bruhl,Les fonctions mentales;L ́evy-Bruhl,Carnets;cf.Ta m b i a h ,Magic, Science, Religion,84–110) and in all cases there is a close interwovenness withtraditional concepts such as sympathy/antipathy, micro/macrocosm,$\u001a\u000b\u0003\f\r\u0011,andthe'\u001d\r\t\u0005\u0004\u0005\f\u0007\u0002\u0003\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\rmentioned above (for example, R ̈ohr,Der okkulte Kraftbegriff; Conger,Theories of Macro-cosms and Microcosms; Allers, “Microcosmus”).140The formulation is taken from Vickers, “The ‘New Historiography’,”132.

A particularlyclear example is the pervasive fascination with a “natural language” of “realsymbols” (highly relevant to astrology and talismanic magic) in which signsare treated asbeingwhat they signify, so that names or images do not just“refer” to persons or things, but are assumed to somehow contain their veryessence.145Among many other instances, one might mention the peculiar141Principe,Secrets of Alchemy,chapter3.142Ibid., chapter9.

A famous statement of this basic point is of course Fou-cault’s chapter “La prose du monde” inLes mots et les choses. How close Foucault’s “archaeological”perspective really is to the type of structuralist theorizing basic to Vickers’ approach is demon-strated by Huppert, “Divinatio et Eruditio,”191–196.

A classicexample of its “Romantic” counterpart is the poet Novalis (for his references to “correspondences,”see Versluis, “Novalis”). Novalis’ vision is brilliant and impressive, but the point here is that italso constitutes a Romantic idealization which leads to anachronistic misreadings if projected backonto the past to interpret Renaissance texts.145Apart from Vickers, see, for example, Coudert, “Some Theories” (with a helpful overview ofexamples from Plato’sCratylusto Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont’sAlphabet of Nature)orthe classic article by Gombrich, “Icones Symbolicae,” esp.175–177.TheCratylusdiscusses “realsymbolism” at length but ends up rejecting it.

With hindsight, if “hermeticism” nevertheless assumed apredominant profile in the imagination of later scholars of the Renaissance,this seems to have been caused not just by the reception of theCorpus Her-meticumand theAsclepiusalone, but probably even more by the influenceof a quite different tradition strongly linked to the name of Hermes: thatof alchemy. It is also this tradition, grounded in the study of natural pro-cesses, that became central to the contextual shift of the later seventeenthcentury and the eighteenth century, emphasized at the beginning of thepresent chapter. As science and natural philosophy began to take the placeof theology and metaphysics as the dominant framework of interpretationin all domains of thought, those who believed in the superiority of ancientwisdom naturally began to emphasize what they saw as Hermes’ teachingsabout the workings of nature.With reference to this development, it is useful to look back for amoment at the entire complex of currents and ideas described by Colbergas “Platonic-Hermetic Christianity.” Colberg’s choice for the double adjec-tive seems to have reflected a quite correct intuition on his part. Althoughhe was trying to describe one unified tradition of heresy, it really consistedof two different strands: a “Platonic” one grounded in the ancient wisdomnarrative and a “Hermetic” one consisting of the “chymical”Naturphiloso-phieassociated with Paracelsus, Weigel, B ̈ohme, and the Rosicrucians. Inthe context of theocculta philosophia(not yet in Agrippa’s work, but cer-tainly in the later development of that synthetic project), these two hadcome to be thoroughly intermingled in the writings of countless authorsuntil, finally, they were widely seen as mutually implying one another aspart of one single worldview.150Nevertheless, on closer scrutiny, we appearto be dealing with a very uneasy marriage (or, if one prefers, a series of onlypartly successful marriage attempts) between two strongly different, evenlogically incompatible intellectual paradigms or styles of thinking.Analytically, I would propose to distinguish the two along the followinglines. The first, “Platonic” paradigm was concerned with ancient wisdomand emerged in the wake of Ficino, as we have seen; the second, “Alchemi-cal” paradigm was concerned with alchemical transmutation and emerged150See, for example, Mandosio, “Quelques aspects.”"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Alchemy between science and religion193as a major force in the wake of Paracelsus. The first was grounded pri-marily in Platonic frameworks and assumptions; the second came to beknown as Hermetic but combined a largely aristotelian framework of nat-ural philosophy with innovative paracelsian concepts. The first reflected atop-down and hierarchical mode of thinking, starting from general meta-physical principles and approaching the lower domain of physical realitiesfrom that perspective; the second took a bottom-up approach, starting withthe physical world but capable of working its way up from there towardsthe realm of the soul. The first was dominated by concepts of universalharmony, starting with a vision of the whole and assigning to everything itsproper place in an essentially static “great chain of being”;151the second wasinherently dynamic, linear, and dialectic, starting with the simple unity ofprimal matter and working its way up from there, by means of dramaticand painful processes of growth and development full of violent conflictsbetween opposed forces or principles. The first implied some “downward”notion of a Fall, as it needed to explain how the darkness of matter andspiritual ignorance could have emerged from the original bliss, perfectionand unity of divine Harmony and Light; the second implied “upward”notions of birth and generation, as it tried to describe how an originalstate of darkness could be the matrix of superior and even divine realities.Finally, the first was conservative and backward-looking, as it argued essen-tially by accumulating the testimonies of past authorities; the second wasless focused on erudition and more open to discovery and new insights,as it relied primarily on direct, personal experience.152If the first stranddeveloped in the context of the Renaissance narrative of ancient wisdom,anchored in the Roman Catholic culture of the Italian Renaissance, thesecond one had its cultural, geographical and linguistic center in Germanculture in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and has been stronglyassociated with native terms such asNaturphilosophieandPansophie.153Although grounded in alchemical models and practice, its scope went far151See the classic study of Lovejoy,Great Chain of Being.152“Experience” should be understood here in its double meaning, as retained in the Frenchexp ́erience:it may refer to empirical experimentation (see, for example, Paracelsus’ emphasis on direct inves-tigation of nature; cf. Halleux, “Pratique de laboratoire et exp ́erience de pens ́ee,”116–118)ortopersonal religious experience (see, for example, B ̈ohme’s emphasis on direct interior revelation). Inboth cases, “experience” is opposed to “blind” reliance on traditional authority, such as Galenismin medicine or the Patristic tradition in Protestantism.153On the concept ofNaturphilosophie, see Faivre, “Nature” (cf.

Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesone can observe continuous attempts at mixing and combining the twomodels, or elements of them; but because they were based on logically con-tradictory forms of reasoning, no truly satisfying and lasting synthesis wasachieved. We are dealing with a very complex dialectics between models ofreality, played out in a historical context where the perspectives of naturalscience, philosophy, theology, and religion were themselves engaged in con-tinuous conflicts, negotiations, and attempts at conciliation. InChapters1and2, we have seen that the ancient wisdom narrative emerged specificallyas a Roman Catholic perspective in the century before Trent, and its agendaof integrating pagan wisdom in the theology of the One Church was anunacceptable heresy for Protestants. Due to its very “catholicity,” the visionof ancient wisdom always remained rather alien to the Protestant mind,154but, interestingly, the “alchemical” alternative did find a very receptiveaudience precisely among Lutherans. There is no doubt that the fertilecombination of Lutheranism and alchemical modes of thought becameresponsible for the most important forms of creative innovation in whatwe now see as “Western esotericism” after the sixteenth century, those ofRosicrucianism and the Christian Theosophy associated with Jacob B ̈ohmeand his followers.155The question of why alchemical modes of thinkingcould be so appealing to Lutherans (but rarely to Calvinists) is important,and should be explored in greater detail than is possible here.156It seems154Walker,Ancient Theology,144–148(mentioning Philippe Duplessis-Mornay, Georges Pacard, andPetrusRamusasexceptions).155Gilly and Niew ̈ohner,Rosenkreuz als europ ̈aischen Ph ̈anomen; Faivre, “Christian Theosophy.”156On the surprising scarcity of serious research concerning the relation between religion and alchemyin the seventeenth century, cf.

In sharp contrast with images of broken harmony and fragmented unitythat were obviously congenial to the recent Roman Catholic experience, thecultural identity of Lutheranism rested upon narratives of a very differentkind, for which alchemical transmutation provided a natural model. Forgenerations now, the experience of Lutherans had been one of a desperate,violent, life-and-death struggle in which the religious individual could nolonger fall back on any authoritative traditions or institutions to give himguidance, but had to trust his personal conscience in attempting to findthe path of “regeneration” (rebirth) by which, through Christ’s grace, hisvery being could be transmuted from the natural darkness of his sinfuland fallen humanity into the spiritual light of divine truth. In the case ofLutherans who took such a narrative to its logical conclusion, the salvationof the soul could not be thought of in platonic terms, as an escape fromthe prison of the body: on the contrary, in the tradition of Jacob B ̈ohme itwas believed to continue its existence after death as a regenerated spiritualbodyof light.157That alchemical models came to be applied to religious contexts bymany authors at least after the sixteenth century is impossible to deny,and we will see how important this fact is for the study of Western eso-tericism. But does this imply that religious or “spiritual” dimensions areinherent or essential to alchemy as such? Scholarly controversies aboutthis question since World War II have been dominated to a remarkabledegree by the legacy of Carl Gustav Jung, which will be discussed in detailinChapter4. At this point, we can be brief. There is no doubt thatalchemical symbolism can be used for illustrating Jungian psychology, butit is a common mistake to conclude from this that Jung’s theories pro-vide a valid framework for the historiography of alchemy, or that alchemyis “really” about spiritual transformation. Both assumptions are false, aswill be seen.158If we wish to understand the relation between alchemyand religion in Western culture, we must therefore begin by trying toforget contemporary Jungian notions of “spiritual alchemy” and make aneffort to understand the sources in their original historical and intellec-tual context. As already noted by the earliest reviewers of Jung’s writings onalchemy, “putting a modern psychological pattern over a system of thought157On the spiritualization of the body in the B ̈ohmian tradition (F. C. Oetinger’sGeistleiblichkeit),see Deghaye, “Jacob Boehme and his Followers”;Naissance de Dieu.158See discussion inChapter4,pp.289–294."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"196The error of historybased on totally different premises” is a perfect recipe for anachronisticmisunderstandings.159At the same time, we must try to avoid the anachronisms that result fromwhat is known as the “Conflict Thesis.”160This essentially nineteenth-century belief in an inherent hostility between “science” and “religion”is based upon the same type of essentialism and reification of mentalcategories that I have already discussed with reference to “magic” – theircompetitor within the well-known “magic–religion–science” triad. TheConflict Thesis remains popular among the general public, but has beenwidely discarded by historians of science since the1980s. Nevertheless, itstenacity is almost as strong as that of “magic,” and its residual influence canbe observed even in the “new historiography of alchemy.” To understandwhy, one must understand that scholars like Principe and Newman are inthe difficult position of doing battle on a double front: they emphasize thescientific legitimacy of alchemy against popular Jungian interpretations(which see it as essentially spiritual)161andagainst the old historiography(which sees it as an “occult” pseudoscience). Their emphasis on alchemyas early modern science and natural philosophy is entirely justified initself, and an important corrective to earlier approaches, but it appearsextremely difficult to avoid the subtle but crucial shift of meaning thatis implicit in statements suggesting that alchemy is therefore “really”science (and not religion). Logically, such a shift implies that althoughreligious elements may be found in the relevant textual corpus, theseare not “really” alchemical, and may thus be marginalized as relativelyunimportant or even dismissed as wholly irrelevant. As a result, in spiteof the anti-positivist thrust of the “new historiography,” one will still endup with a (crypto)essentialist position reminiscent of the Conflict Thesis:alchemy may sometimes look like religion, but it is really science.This effect may well be unintentional: against the “whiggish” or “presen-tist” projections of normative modernist agendas upon the past, the “newhistoriography” emphasizes the study of primary sources within their own159G. H., Review of Jung’sAlchemie und Psychologie,66; and see the analogous remarks in Pagel,“Jung’s Views on Alchemy,”48.160The “Conflict Thesis” is linked to the names of John William Draper,History of the Conflictbetween Religion and Science(1874) and Andrew Dickson White,History of the Warfare of Sciencewith Theology in Christendom(1896).

Acknowledging the presence of religiouselements throughout the alchemical corpus does not commit us to occultistor Jungian ideas of “spiritual alchemy,” and emphasizing alchemy as a sci-entific pursuit does not need to imply that religious references are marginalor secondary to what alchemy is “really” all about. Instead, I would proposeto look at alchemy as a complex historical and cultural phenomenon thatdoesnothave a conceptual core or essence (whether scientific, rational, reli-gious, spiritual, or psychological) but is characterized by basic proceduresof transmutation that can be pursued in laboratory settingsandfunction asnarratives in religious or philosophical discourse.162From such a perspective(to give just one example), questions such as whether the famous “visions”of Zosimos are essential or marginal to his alchemy become not just irrele-vant, but meaningless; however, the fact that those visions appear togetherwith strictly technical descriptions in one and the same textual corpusbecomes an important fact that cries out for interpretation.163Implicit insuch a comprehensive, radically historical, and (therefore) anti-eclectic164perspective is the recognition of alchemy as a “textually cumulative”165tra-dition that has kept acquiring new dimensions (scientific, philosophical,religious, eventually literary, artistic, or psychological) and has thereforebeenevolvingthroughout the many stages of its long history, not just untilthe eighteenth century but up to the present day.166162Similarly, Didier Kahn describes the history of alchemy as obviously pertaining to the historyof science and natural philosophy, but also embracing such domains as emblematics, the arts,mythology, architecture, moral philosophy, philosophy of language, and philology: “Reconstituerl’histoire de l’alchimie, c’est n ́ecessairement replacer cette derni`ere dans l’int ́egralit ́educontextculturel de son temps” (Kahn,Alchimie et Paracelsisme,6–8).163See Mertens,Zosime de Panopolis,207–212.164SeeChapter2,page152.165See page189,withnote140.166The tenacity of the Conflict Thesis is again demonstrated by a widespread tendency of seeingthe history of alchemy as ending in the eighteenth century. Not only does this reflect the crypto-essentialist thesis that alchemy is “really” science; but by suggesting that alchemy ended whenmodern chemistry came into its own, it ironically lends support to the very notion of alchemyas “proto-science” that is rejected so emphatically, and with so much justification, by the “newhistoriography” (Newman and Principe, “Alchemyvs. Chemistry”; cf. Principe,Chymists andChymistry; but see now Principe,Secrets,Chapter4).

In a seminal article on thephilosophical foundations of medieval alchemy, Barbara Obrist has shownhow the very fact that thequalitates occultaewere considered inaccessibleto the human intellect led to the idea, as early as the second half ofthe thirteenth century, that they could be accessed by means of otherand “higher” faculties for gaining knowledge: those of direct intuitionor divine revelation.167As alchemists failed to be successful in achievingtransmutation, they reacted with a proliferation of theoretical models andan increasing emphasis on the difficulty of understanding the ancientauthorities, who must have intentionally hidden their true meanings. Tohave any chance at achieving certain knowledge in the domain of alchemy,one therefore needed to submit oneself to the divine truth by means offaith, which in thirteenth-century Western society meant the eucharistictheology of God’s incarnation and the resurrection of Christ.168The newstatus of alchemy from such a perspective, as explained by Obrist, is shownexemplarily in Petrus Bonus of Ferrara’sPretiosa margarita novellafrom thefirst part of the fourteenth century, which states explicitly that alchemyis “partly natural and partly divine or supernatural” and speaks of aninvisible “divine hidden stone” (lapis divinus occultus) that is indispensablefor completing the Great Work. This stone cannot be apprehended bythe human intellect but can only be known through divine inspiration orrevelation, and is what enabled the ancient sages to prophesy.169One understands how attractive such a notion must have been to her-metic enthusiasts in the wake of the translation of theCorpus Hermeticum.Thus, Lodovico Lazzarelli and his mentor, the apocalyptic prophet Gio-vanni da Correggio, already saw Petrus Bonus as the conveyor of a “sacredmystery”170and began to study laboratory alchemy for evidently religiousand eschatological rather than scientific reasons by the end of the fifteenthcentury. Lazzarelli transcribed thePretiosa margarita novellaand a collec-tion of alchemical recipes from what is known as the “Pseudo-Lullian”tradition,171and Correggio wrote an original text based upon the sameevolves or mutates through history, this implies that nineteenth-century occultist and “spiritual”understandings of alchemy as well as their further developments in Jungian psychology, and soon, are legitimate objects of study (which is not the same thing as methodological perspectivesforstudy) in the history of alchemy.167Obrist, “Les rapports d’analogie,”52–54.

On the contrary:alchemical practice could be seen as a necessary part of interior regener-ation. Lazzarelli’s case makes this perfectly clear: alchemy is identified asmagia naturalisand concerned with “the conjunction of a body with abody,”magia celestisis concerned with “the conjunction of a soul with abody,” andmagia sacerdotalis & divinawith “the conjunction of a soul witha soul.”175In this manner, alchemy becomes the first stage in a universal“magical” process of transformation that links the body to the soul andleads like a “stairway to heaven” from material nature all the way up to thedivine. Addressing his own book of pseudo-Lullian recipes in the secondperson, Lazzarelli writes:You will show me the forces and secrets of nature;You will lead me to the sanctuaries of the Word-begotten God.Each thing is a step to the next: while making known her Maker,Nature clears for us a highway to the stars,And clearly reveals to us that all things are one, and one is all;That heaven is on earth, and that God is present in things.176172See Hanegraaff, “Pseudo-Lullian Alchemy and the Mercurial Phoenix.”173Crisciani, “Hermeticism and Alchemy,”148.174Lazzarelli,CraterHermetis25.4, in Hanegraaff and Bouthoorn,Lodovico Lazzarelli,246–247.Theterm “spiritual alchemy” would not be applicable to Lazzarelli, for two reasons. First, because of hisevident interest in the practical alchemy of Petrus Bonus and Pseudo-Lull. Second, because his talkof “interior regeneration” was not meant as a metaphor for purely “spiritual” processes, but referredto a literal transformation of the entire person understood as an organically integrated unity ofbody, soul, and spirit. See detailed analysis in Hanegraaff, “Lodovico Lazzarelli and the HermeticChrist,” esp.70–71; and for the crucial impact of these concepts on Agrippa, see Hanegraaff,“Better than Magic.”175Hanegraaff, “Lodovico Lazzarelli and the Hermetic Christ,”96–99.176Lazzarelli, “Vade Mecum,” in: Hanegraaff and Bouthoorn,Lodovico Lazzarelli,274–275."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"200The error of historyLazzarelli and Correggio are minor figures in the history of alchemy, butvery important here as illustrations of how early alchemy came to beincluded in the religious framework of the ancient wisdom narrative, atleast by some of its defenders, and how natural it was for this to happen. Asfor the much more influential writings of Marsilio Ficino, alchemy playeda very minor role in them. However, as has been shown in impressivedetail by Sylvain Matton, Ficino’s references (in hisDe Vita) to alchemyin relation with his central concept ofspiritus mundi, in the context of avitalist worldview that saw even metals and stones as endowed with “life,”came to exert a truly extraordinary influence on alchemists from the endof the sixteenth century on. Mixed with the paracelsian concept of “AerialNiter,” Ficino’sspiritusfinally gained an overwhelming influence in thealchemical and iatrochemical literature of the seventeenth century.177With this, we have come to the intellectual tradition that is chieflyresponsible for the fact that alchemical models were developed, from thesixteenth century on, into a full-blown “paradigm” ofNaturphilosophieorPansophiewith both religious and scientific dimensions, always in complexinteraction with the Platonizing models proper to the Renaissance narrativeof ancient wisdom.

Among the earliest examples is Heinrich Khun-rath, famous for the impressive illustrations of hisAmphitheatre of EternalWisdom(1609).181The RosicrucianFama Fraternitatis(1614) criticized “theungodly and accursed gold-making” but presented Christian Rosenkreutzas adept at metallic transmutation and placed Paracelsus’ work in his innersanctuary;182and alchemical models and narratives of transmutation werecentral to the famousChymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosenkreuz(1616), asthey were to the theosophical and cosmosophical writings of later self-proclaimed Rosicrucians such as Michael Maier and Robert Fludd. Like-wise, alchemy and Paracelsianism provided the essential models used by thetheologies, or theosophies, of “reintegration” developed by Jacob B ̈ohmeand his followers.183The role of practical alchemy in this current couldrange from very important, as in Khunrath, to negligible or non-existent,as in B ̈ohme; but it is important to emphasize that even in the latter case,references to alchemical transmutation werenotjust metaphors for purely“spiritual” processes. On the contrary: against the docetist implications ofplatonic idealism, B ̈ohme’s perspective was thoroughly incarnational androoted in organic concepts (not just metaphors) of birth and generation.He described how out of the mysterious and unknowableUngrundbeforeall manifestation, God himself had been born as abody, constituted of thedarkness of “wrath” (Zorn, associated with the God of the Old Testament)redeemed by the light of “love” (associated with Christ). In an originalstate beyond time and space, God had thus come into existence as a perfectbody of Light, referred to as “eternal nature” (die ewige Natur), in whichthe potentially destructive darkness of wrath was immanent but renderedharmless and invisible by the redemptive light of love. Due to the fall ofLucifer, however, who was born in “eternal nature” as a perfect being of180Gilly, “Theophrastia Sancta”(quotationonp.173);Adam Haslmayr.

In thisdark and threatening world, Man is born as a mortal creature; but in anexact “microcosmic” parallel to God’s own birth, Christ can be literally(again: not just metaphorically!) born within his own being as a body oflight. The universal process of “reintegration” involves the salvation notjust of human individuals, but of Nature itself: the fallen body of Godshould be restored by being transmuted into its original perfection as aneternal world of light. This entire theosophical scheme based on alchemi-cal/paracelsian models was resolutely incarnational and anti-idealist,184andcan therefore be called “spiritual” only with reservations. “The great lessonof the theosophy of B ̈ohme,” as formulated by Pierre Deghaye, is that “itis the devil who denies the body. The devil is an idealist.”185Precisely thisconcept of nature as a spiritual body that could be transmuted into divinelight made it highly attractive to eighteenth-century thinkers who rejectedEnlightenment rationalism as a dualist heresy that pitted empty rationalabstractions against an equally empty world of mere matter-in-motion.186A comprehensive understanding of alchemy, as a cultural phenomenonthat evolves and mutates through history, has the advantage of embrac-ing both its religious and scientific dimensions without playing them outagainst one another according to an either/or logic. However, like anymodel, it comes at a price: it may be evident to us that theosophicalspeculations such as in B ̈ohmenism are grounded in alchemical narra-tives, but this does not imply that, in their own time, they were knownas “alchemy” or “chemistry” or seen as connected to science (that is, eticdoes not coincide here with emic terminology).

The conflict between Christian theosophical andidealist modes of thinking (opposed as “incarnational” versus “docetic”) is perfectly exemplified,in the eighteenth century, by the case of Oetinger in relation to Swedenborg: see Hanegraaff,Swedenborg, Oetinger, Kant,67–85.185Deghaye, “Jacob Boehme and his Followers,”241;andcf.Deghaye,Naissance de Dieu,54:“Thedemons do not incarnate.

The parallel process by which“alchemy” came to be excluded from “genuine science” during the eight-eenth century occurred, however, in the domains of science and history ofscience; and for that story, we can ignore the purely theosophical lines ofspeculation and concentrate on what was known explicitly as “alchemy” or“chemistry” in the seventeenth century. As emphasized by many scholars,these terms (chimie/alchimie, chemie/alchemie, chymia/alchymia) werestill used interchangeably, so that it was simply impossible to draw the linesof demarcation familiar to us.187For this reason, Newman and Principehave proposed to use the seventeenth-century term “chymistry” as a generalinclusive term at least for this period.188Of course, the adoption of sucha terminological convention strengthens their agenda of studying alchemyas a normal part of natural philosophy, while highlighting the polemicalopposition of chemistry versus alchemy as a later invention that should notbe projected back onto the past.For our concerns, the crucial question is why that polemical oppositionemerged in the first place, and why it became so singularly successful.Attempts to answer this question have been surprisingly scarce: if scholarsof alchemy refer to it at all, it is usually clear that their thinking stands underthe spell of the “magic versus science” dualism, and hence they seldomsuggest much more than that alchemy was separated from chemistry dueto the rise of experimental science.189Clearly this will not do. If alchemydid not exist apart from chemistry, even terminologically, then therewasno such entity for scientists to reject in the first place! And since thealchemy/chemistry distinction is clearly modeled upon the magic/sciencedistinction, using the latter to explain the former amounts to explaininga phenomenon in terms of the very thing that needs to be explained. Amuch more convincing solution has been suggested, almost in passing,by Allen G. Debus in1985. Discussing the controversy between the anti-Paracelsian Hermann Conring and his opponent Olaus Borrichius – whichwas given wide publicity in the world of science and learning through the187Rocke, “Agricola, Paracelsus, and ‘Chymia’”; Mandosio, “Quelques aspects de l’alchimie”; Newmanand Principe, “Alchemyvs. Chemistry”; Abbri, “Alchemy and Chemistry”; Halleux,Les textesalchimiques,47–49.

They also propose to use the term“chrysopoeia” specifically for the procedures concerned with making gold (ibid.,141–142).189See, for example, the section on “the separation between chemistry and alchemy” in Halleux,Textes alchimiques,47–49. Newman and Principe note that “in the early eighteenth century, thedomain of ‘alchemy’ was for the first time widely restricted to gold making” (“Some Problems,”386), but this seems to be an effect of the polemical distinction rather than its fundamental cause."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"204The error of historyJournal des Sc ̧avansand thePhilosophical Transactionsof the Royal Societyin the1660sand1670s190– Debus pointed out that whereas the Frenchchemical textbooks of the seventeenth century paid scant attention to thehistorical backgrounds of their discipline, the Paracelsians and alchemistswere marked by a strong interest in presenting themselves as the inheritorsof an ancient and venerable tradition going back to Hermes Trismegistus,if not all the way to Adam.191Admittedly, Debus’ own formulation alreadyassumes the distinction (“chemists” versus “alchemists”) that is in needof explanation, but what counts is his way of defining the two basicapproaches. The one that would generally come to be known as “alchemy”has been nicely described by M. J. Ehrard in the early1960s: “When thechimisteis not at his furnace and his flasks, he is collating, with a passionfull of respect, the precious texts of the Ancients: his ambition is less thatof making science progress than that of recovering a lostsecret.”192The search for the historical origins of (al)chemy became systematicin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.193However, in the wake ofCasaubon and the general decline of theprisca theologia, such attitudes ofantiquarian scholarship grounded in historiographies of ancient wisdomseem to have turned into a serious liability for Paracelsians and, moregenerally, for chymists who understood themselves asFilii Hermetis.Ifthere was certainly no clear distinction betweenchymiaandalchymiainthe early modern period, then, it may be useful to draw a distinction alonga different axis: between chymists who thought of themselves primarily asbelonging to a learnedtraditionwhose forgotten secrets they tried to recoverfrom the texts and test in the laboratory, and those who saw themselves190Philosophical Transactions3(1668),779–788;10(1675),296–301;Journal des Sc ̧avans3(1675),209–211.191Debus, “Significance of Chemical History,”3.

The historiographical tradi-tion begins with the Paracelsian Bostocke,Difference(see Debus, “Elizabethan History”;ChemicalPromise,219–228). The criticism of such historiographies seems to have begun in1661with Ursi-nus,De Zoroastre Bactriano(Ganzenm ̈uller, “Wandlungen,”145), but the confrontation betweenConring and Borrichius has been more important historically. See Halleux (“La controverse,”812–813) on the initially surprising focus on ancient hermetic origins even among the followersof Paracelsus, known for his rejection of ancient authorities like Aristotle, Galen, or Avicenna. Inpractice, Paracelsians do not seem to have seen any contradiction: their discipline was consideredat least as ancient as whatever could be claimed by their aristotelian and Galenic rivals, but superiorprecisely because of its method of studying nature directly instead of learning about it from books.192Ehrard, “Mat ́erialisme et naturalisme,”197. The same point was made very recently by RobertHalleux: “First of all, the alchemist is a man alone in front of a book. The book affirms that theAncients have realized the magisterium (expertum), and the alchemist believes it. But the alchemistdoes not understand how” (Savoir de la main,137).193Halleux, “La controverse,”807andpassim."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Alchemy between science and religion205primarily as experimental scientists and could therefore dispense with ahistorical pedigree. Both were doing science, but they looked differentlyat what they were doing, and were perceived differently. The distinctionis reminiscent of what would become known, in the terms of C. P. Snow,as the “two cultures” of humanities and sciences in the modern academy:one primarily historical and hermeneutical, the other primarily concernedwith direct experimental study of the natural world. My suggestion is that,by and large, the former trend was discredited along with the generaldecline of the ancient wisdom narrative and was eventually rejected underthe label of “alchemy,” while the latter trend developed into what we nowrecognize as “chemistry.” Such a separation was all the more logical because,as explained by Robert Halleux, the basic assumptions of the former werebecoming a serious obstacle from the perspective of the latter:the main point ofexperientia– that is to say, of putting the procedure into practicein the laboratory – consists in demonstrating to the operator that he has understoodthe art. If the experiment goes wrong, one must start over. For while the success ofthe procedure provides “experimental” confirmation of the theory, its failure neverdisconfirms it. Here we touch upon the main weakness of alchemicalexperientia:reduced to the role of illustrating the theory, it never questions the correctness ofthe latter. The Ancients are right, no matter what happens in the laboratory.194The argument becomes even more compelling if we look at what hadhappened to the discourse of “secrecy” during the seventeenth century.InChapter1, I discussed the Renaissance idea that theprisci theologihadspoken about divine things under the guise of mythological fable: theancient wisdom was a hidden wisdom. Furthermore, we saw that the fas-cination of Pico della Mirandola’s kabbalah lay in the fact that he seemedto have discovered a universal hermeneutic key grounded in the originalMosaic revelation, which promised to reveal the secret, hidden, invisibleconnections between all domains of knowledge. The result was an enor-mously increased emphasis on secrecy and concealment in the context ofthe ancient wisdom discourse and theocculta philosophia;195and naturally,this development affected alchemy as well. William Newman and LawrencePrincipe have emphasized the function of alchemicalDecknamenand sym-bolic imagery, often derived from Greek mythology, as straightforwardcodes for technical recipes since the Middle Ages and through the earlymodern period.196This is a welcome correction of Jungian interpretations,194Halleux, “Pratique de laboratoire et exp ́erience,”120; cf. Halleux,Savoir de la main,136.195SeeChapter1,pp.64–68.196See, for example, Newman, “‘Decknamen’”; Principe, “Revealing Analogies.”"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"206The error of historybut it does not exhaust the topic. Firstly, alchemists since the fifteenth cen-tury also began to interpret ancient monuments and mythological as wellas biblical stories as alchemical allegories, suggesting that this was how theAncients had concealed their secrets:197in such cases, we are not dealingwith recipes concealed by symbols and mythological references, but withan alchemical hermeneutics of architecture and mythology inspired by thesearch for “ancient wisdom.” Furthermore, alchemical techniques of dis-simulation took on a life of their own during the Baroque era: partly underthe influence of kabbalah, they developed into a full-blown “mystery dis-course” that could go far beyond the relatively straightforward procedure ofcoding chemical contents.198In Frank Greiner’s formulation, by adoptingthe “obscure style of the philosophers,” one identified oneself as part of “aprestigious tradition that could sometimes provide mediocre works witha halo of mystery so as to mask their poverty even better.”199Finally, verymuch in line with the literary tastes of the Baroque, some alchemical authorsdeveloped incredibly complicated tricks and techniques of dissimulationto mystify the reader and lead him through a labyrinth full of enigmasand false turns, in search of an answer that kept eluding him forever.200Insuch cases, the dialectics of concealment and discovery became an end initself, and alchemical emblematics could function in a manner somewhatreminiscent of modern cryptograms: sophisticated intellectual games forthe pleasure of the erudite, here with an additional dimension of moraledification.The emphasis on secrecy led to a distinction between two basic styles ofwriting in chymical literature, muchearlierthan the terminological sepa-ration between alchemy and chemistry. An excellent example is David dePlanis Campy’sOpening of the School of Metallic Transmutational Philosophy(1633), devoted specifically to this question, where we read the following:Those who have discussed the Arts & Sciences have taken care to give them a veryclear & intelligible order, beginning with general matters so as to end with specialones. But in this Art [of metallic transmutation] one does the complete opposite,for sometimes one has begun at the end & ended at the beginning, & all that withso little order that, not at all having determined what it is, they have driven theirreaders into despair about never understanding nothing of it.201197Halleux, “Le mythe de Nicolas Flamel,”237; “La controverse,”811–812.198For many examples, see Greiner, “Art du feu, art du secret.”199Ibid.,210.200See the many examples given by Greiner,ibid.,217–223.201Planis Campy,Ouverture de l’escolle,8–9.

With this, we have come to a final core dimension of what wouldcome to be known as Western esotericism after the eighteenth century.the organization of secrecyCentral to the ancient wisdom discourse of the Renaissance was the ideaof a superior wisdom that had been known to the Ancients, but hadbeen forgotten and needed to be rediscovered and restored. Similarly, thealchemists were perceived as searching for the lost secret of their art, hiddenby enigmatic symbols that needed to be deciphered. Both highlighted theEgyptian Hermes Trismegistus as one of the earliest authorities, if notthe very origin of the lost knowledge; and both believed that it had beentransmitted, in a veiled and hidden manner, by divinely inspired sages or byalchemical “adepts” from generation to generation. Remarkably, however,the idea that the transmission of secret knowledge required some kindof formalorganizationdoes not seem to have occurred to anyone beforethe early seventeenth century. It is only in the first of the Rosicrucianmanifestoes, theFama Fraternitatis(1614), that we encounter the conceptof a secret brotherhood founded for the express purpose of ensuring thetransmission of superior knowledge through the centuries. Already in thisearliest instance, the knowledge was concerned with the secrets ofnaturestudied by what was becoming known as the “occult” sciences.202As thelegend of the Rosicrucians developed, in parallel and close interaction withthe spread of Paracelsianism, alchemy came to assume a central role in202See Andreae,Fama Fraternitatis; and as a first introduction, Edighoffer, “Rosicrucianism I” (andbibliography there)."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"208The error of historyit. As suggested earlier, it provided an excellent model for narratives ofspiritual rebirth and regeneration, which could be applied to individualsand even to the hoped-for transformation of society as a whole; and theidea of “hermetic adepts” passing on the secrets of their art by means ofsymbolic language was eminently applicable to the concept of a secretbrotherhood passing on the true secrets of nature and the divine.203It wasonly a small step to suggest that their mastery of the “occult sciences” gavethe members of this invisible brotherhood extraordinary magical powers;and in the context of growing tensions between the Protestant Union andthe Catholic League within the Holy Roman Empire, the Rosicrucianscame to exist in the popular imagination as a “conspirational Protestantfraternity” working in secret as a counterpart to the Jesuit order.204Thefascinating question of when and where, exactly, the legend of a Rosicrucianbrotherhood led to the emergence ofactualRosicrucian organizations canonly be answered on the basis of precise archival researches and must be lefthere for specialists to decide.205For our concerns, we can concentrate onthe uncontroversial fact that the concept of a secret brotherhood of initiatesdid become a historical reality with the establishment of Freemasonry.But when did it get established?

Most of the medieval craft guilds were locally based,but the stonemason’s trade was unusual because it required craftsmen tomove around from job to job and often stay for extended periods at abuilding site far from home. To accommodate their special needs, workingplaces called “lodges” were instituted, where the workmen could meet,eat, rest, and even sleep. If unknown strangers arrived who claimed to bemasons, admission procedures were needed to decide whether they werequalified members of the craft who could be accepted as colleagues. Priorto admission to the lodge, they would therefore be examined, perhapsby asking them to give a demonstration of their skill, answer questionsabout the practice of masonry or the legendary lore of the craft, or givestandard responses amounting to identification codes or passwords.209Ifthey satisfied the requirements, they would be asked to swear obedience totherulesofthecraftandpreserveitssecrets.This legendary lore of the craft is particularly important for our con-cerns. It is contained in the so-called Old Charges, which have survivedin many versions but all share a similar form and message.210They equatemasonry with one of the seven liberal sciences or arts, that of geometry.This supreme art had allegedly been invented by Jabal, one of the sons ofLamech mentioned in the Old Testament. Jabal had inscribed the secretsof the art on a pillar that survived the great Flood and was discovered byHermarius, a great-grandson of Moses and in fact none other than Her-mes Trismegistus. From him, the knowledge of masonry/geometry spreadthroughout the world. Abraham and his associate Euclid taught it to theEgyptians, and it eventually reached the Holy Land, where King David andhis son Solomon used it to build the great temple of Jerusalem. Masons whohad worked on that supreme project spread the craft to other countries,including England, where it arrived thanks to St. Alban.211Fanciful as theselegendary histories might be, there was nothing extraordinary about them.The other crafts, too, used to claim supremacy by boasting of their greatantiquity: in fact, another son of Lamech, Tubal-Cain, was often invoked208Stevenson,Origins of Freemasonry,4.

Freemasonry was not originallythe rationalist and humanitarian movement that it eventually became, atleast in England. Even during the early decades of the eighteenth century,it was still strongly associated with “Rosy-Crucians and Adepts, Brothers ofthe same Fraternity, or Order, who derived themselves from Hermes Tris-megistus, which some call Moses,” and accordingly, its initiates were widelybelieved to be alchemical practitioners.220There is nothing surprising aboutthis, for several reasons. Like the legendary Rosicrucian brotherhood, theOrder was at first still resolutely Christian (Jews, Muslims or pagans wereexcluded; oaths were sworn on the Bible; the demand of tolerance was lim-ited to the various Christian sects).221Furthermore, alchemy and masonryweresimilarinthatbothweregroundedinmedievalartsorcrafts,andboth boasted legendary histories of a very similar kind, with a central rolefor Hermes and Egypt. Since the Rosicrucians were believed to harbor theancient and secret knowledge of the occult sciences, alchemy in particu-lar, it was quite natural to have similar suspicions about the Freemasons.And finally, alchemists were looking for the great secret of transmutationthat had been known to the Ancients and that some believed might becoded in myths and architecture; and Freemasons, too, were searching fora lost secret, whether it was the “Mason Word” or (eventually) the secretof Hiram Abiff, the legendary architect of Solomon’s temple.222For many219Le Forestier,Franc-Mac ̧onnerie templi`ere et occultiste,vol.i,32.

In fact, if anything represented a departurefrom the tradition, it was the rationalist, humanitarian and deist outlookthat came to dominate English Freemasonry. Very similar to how modernchemistry established its identity by splitting off from chymistry, then,modern Freemasonry did so by renouncing parts of its own tradition; inthe former case, the rejected part became known as “alchemy,” in the latter(as will be seen) it became the archetype of “occult brotherhoods.” Forour discussion we need not trace this process as it took place in Free-masonry, but it would seem to have started in the early period after1717: very significantly, the historical genealogies of Freemasonry in Free-masonry’s foundational document, James Anderson’sConstitutions(firstedition1723, second expanded edition1738), had already become entirelybiblical in that no more mention was made of Hermes Trismegistus. Allthe credit for Egyptian masonry went to Moses.225English Freemasonryneeded an impressive historical pedigree, but had apparently decided thatit could dispense with a “hermetic” one.Decisive for our concerns is the fact that, once the Rosicrucianlegendof a secret brotherhood had given rise to actual initiatoryorganizationsin the shape of Freemasonry, this new phenomenon became a modelthat could be projected back into the past: the legendary histories ofancient wisdom, to which we have given so much attention, now cameto be reinterpreted in terms of such initiatory organizations as well.

This idea became important indebates about monasticism after the Reformation: many Catholic authorsdefended monasticism by tracing it to the “Christian” Essenes, againstProtestants who insisted that they had been Jews. In the heat of thesedebates, Catholics made Jesus, Mary, John the Baptist and the apostlesinto Essenes, and this notion has never vanished since.227The modern phase of the Essene legend began with Johann GeorgWachter, most famous for hisDer Spinozismus im J ̈udenthumb(1699). Inan influential text of1707, revised in1717, he described the Essenes as rep-resentatives of a strictly natural theology on deist foundations that could betraced back to Egypt and the kabbalah.228Jesus had been an Essene, and far226On this topic, see Wagner,Essener; Hammer and Snoek, “Essenes”; Maurice, “Mysterien derAufkl ̈arung,”282–286. For the Essene legend in modern and contemporary esotericism, see alsoKranenborg, “Presentation of the Essenes”; Hanegraaff,New Age Religion,314–319.227Wagner,Essener,3–8. Carmelites in the seventeenth century had a particularly strong investmentin the Essene legend: they wanted to trace their own order back to Elijah/Elisa and saw the Essenesas the missing link. Jesus and his apostles were made into Essenes, and thus into Carmelites (ibid.,5). This Carmelite–Essene connection has even found its way into twentieth-century New Ageliterature, by way of the American seer Edgar Cayce (Hanegraaff,New Age Religion,316–317).228Wa c h t e r,De primordiis Christianae religionis15(Schr ̈oder ed.,62)."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"214The error of historyfrom being based upon divine revelation, his religion was a purely histor-ical phenomenon. This thesis was taken up by Enlightenment thinkers asfamous as Voltaire and Frederick the Great: “Jesus was in fact an Essene; hewas imbued with the morality of the Essenes, which is much like Zeno’s.His religion was a pure deism, and see what we have made of it [voyezcomme nous l’avons brod ́ee].”229As suggested by this last sentence, whenseen as the original source of “pure Christianity,” the Essenes could easily beused as ammunition in the Protestant/Enlightenment attack on the “Hel-lenization of Christianity.” In the formulation of Andreas Riem in1792,“Christianity is therefore really ‘Essaism,’ which retained its purity untilPaul accepted the heathens into Christianity.”230The idea of the Essenesas a brotherhood devoted to a reasonable religion on deist foundationsmade them irresistible to English Freemasonry. Beginning with aDefenseof Masonrypublished in1730/31, they came to be described first as a kindof Freemasons avant la lettre, and soon as the original form of masonictradition.231But non-masonic Enlightenment thinkers, too, began to lookat the Essenes/Therapeutae as a secret brotherhood with enlightened idealsthat had had its representatives everywhere. How strongly the masonicmodel came to affect the imagination of contemporary theologians canbe seen, for example, from a book by Carl Friedrich St ̈audlin about Jesus’moral teachings (1799):The Essenes were not just a sect, but a kind of Order of a partly public andpartly secret society. They existed in great numbers...spread through Pales-tine, Syria and, apparently, wherever there were Jews...Whoever wanted tobe admitted into the sect, had to go through several grades...The practicingEssenes . . . were apparently a kind of secret Order, which was not just very similarto the Pythagoreans, but greatly participated in its origins as well as in the doc-trine and school of Pythagoras. They were not just a school, a sect, or a society,but a Brotherhood [Bund] and Order...Whoever wanted to enter the societywas first tested for a long time about his opinions and morals, and when he hadbeen admitted, he slowly rose through three grades up to the fourth and high-est . . . The Order must also, mainly in the higher grades, have had mysteries,of which Josephus and Philo knew nothing, and which have not become pub-licly known . . . They probably traced their institution and its mysteries back toMoses.232229Frederick II, Letter to d’Alembert, October18,1770(Schr ̈oder, “Einleitung,”13).230Riem,Christus und die Vernunft,704n.2, here quoted according to Wagner,Essener,23.231Hammer and Snoek, “Essenes,”341; Wagner,Essener,21–39; Le Forestier,Franc-Mac ̧onnerie tem-pli`ere et occultiste,vol.i,72.232St ̈audlin,Geschichte der Sittenlehre Jesu,vol.i,456,459,478–479,483.

For Freemasons, with their focuson geometry, Pythagoreanism was particularly attractive in that regard.233But to present Freemasonry convincingly as the inheritor of ancient initi-atic orders, a large historical gap still needed to be bridged. Enter the Orderof the Knights Templar.Since the Temple of Jerusalem plays such a central role in masonic sym-bolism, it cannot surprise that Freemasons developed a special interest in thechivalric Order that had been charged with its defense. In a famous speechof1736, the “chevalier” Andrew Michael Ramsay presented the Crusadersas the ancestors of Freemasonry; and in the years that followed, connec-tions with the medieval Knights Templar began to be suggested.234Stillbefore1750, this led to the creation of a Templar high degree, the “OrdreSublime des Chevaliers Elus,”235followed by an entire system of TemplarFreemasonry in the so-called Strict Observance that became dominant inGermanyfromthe1750s through the1770s.236At being admitted intothe “Inner Order,” it was revealed to the candidate that the original orderof the Knights Templar had not vanished, but survived in Freemasonry,and was governed in an occult manner by the “Unknown Superiors.” Outof these masonic contexts, a whole series of non-masonic “neo-Templar”traditions has emerged since the early nineteenth century, continuing upto the present day.237As the Templars established themselves in the Holy Land, so it wasargued, they had made contact with secret Essenian and Pythagoreantraditions that had managed to survive there since antiquity.238WhenPhillip IV cracked down on the Knights Templar in1307, followed by thedissolution of the Order by Pope Clement V, their Grand Master Jacquesde Molay had managed to bring the secrets of the Order into safety.

Note that we are dealing with an alternative version ofthe transmission of spiritual knowledge from the Orient to the West: fromPythagorean sources, the ancient wisdom is believed to have been adoptedby the Essenes in the Holy Land, from where the surviving Templarsbrought it to Scotland. Since the eighteenth century, this Pythagorean–Essenian–Templar–Masonic filiation has given rise to an endless and stillexpanding series of further historical fantasies and conspiracy theories aboutsecret networks and societies searching for the Ultimate Secret or suspectedof possessing it.240The contents of that secret have obviously remained unknown. However,we have seen that, in the early days, it was often thought to be alchemical.Hence, for example, the famous wealth of the medieval Knight Templar:surely they had discovered the secret of the Stone! Hence, also, the strongconcern with practical alchemy in eighteenth-century organizations liketheIllumin ́es d’Avignon241or theGold- und Rosenkreuz.242But as primarilyor even exclusively religious interpretations of alchemy flourished, thealchemical secret of transmutation could also come to be understood interms of a process of spiritual transformation or reintegration, leading tothe attainment of a superior gnosis. In this manner, Christian theosophicalinterpretations of the alchemical quest could furnish an ideal model forthe goals of spiritual development pursued by a plethora of new esoteric239Strasbourg manuscript,c.1760, as published in Schiffmann,Entstehung der Rittergrade,178–191(here188–190); cf. le Forestier,Franc-Mac ̧onnerie templi`ere et occultiste,vol.i,68–73.240For an introduction to the mental labyrinth of these speculations, the best reference remainsUmberto Eco’s extremely well-informed novelFoucault’s Pendulum.

For example, the announcement in the previousquotation that “the doors will open and the light will shine for all” clearlyechoes the prophecy of the RosicrucianFama Fraternitatisthat “a doorwill open for Europe,” leading to a “general reformation” of the world.However, for anybody who disliked or distrusted the religious perspectivesin question, such predictions were bound to sound like a threat rather thana promise. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Jesuit Abb ́eBarruelwas claiming in his famousM ́emoires pour servir`a l’histoire du Jacobinisme(1798–1799) – which has been described as “the bible of the secret societymythology”246– that the threat had indeed become a catastrophic realitywith the French Revolution. Ever since, conservatives of every ilk have beentempted to follow his lead in blaming the modern world and its democraticinstitutions on a demonic conspiracy of underground organizations.247This, too, would become an essential part of how “the occult” came to beimagined in the modern world.Where does this bring us? In the first two chapters, I outlined the ancientwisdom narrative that emerged in the Roman Catholic culture of theItalian Renaissance, and its counterpart, the anti-pagan/anti-platonic nar-rative that culminated in largely Protestant polemics in seventeenth-centuryGermany. As pointed out at the end ofChapter2, due to their incompat-ibility with the findings of modern historical criticism, neither of the twoperspectives has been able to keep up with scholarly progress. Having lostall credit in modern academic discourse, the former survived only in a typ-ical dilettante genre of occult literature for the popular market, the latter243For introductory historical overviews, see, for example, the two classic studies by Webb,TheOccult UndergroundandThe Occult Establishment.

However, two new paradigmsemerged in the decades around1700: a “religionist” approach grounded inthe centrality of direct, unmediated, personal experience of the divine, anda skeptical Enlightenment alternative grounded in rationality and “soundjudgment.” Both positions are ideological rather than empirical, and essen-tially non-historical: for the former, the centrality of religious experiencemakes the outcomes of historical criticism ultimately irrelevant to whatreligion is “really” all about, whereas the latter treats the historical cur-rents and ideas with which we are concerned as non-historical universals ofhuman thinking and behavior (“prejudice,” “superstition,” “foolishness,”or “stupidity”). In spite of their clearly non-historical assumptions – orperhaps, more worryingly, because of them – these new paradigms haveboth been remarkably successful in academic culture: the Enlightenmentparadigm has been dominant through the nineteenth and much of thetwentieth century, and we will see how important the religionist optionwould become particularly in the twentieth century.To these two sets of alternatives, we must now add a third one, basedupon the novel concept of secret organizations. Understood positively, itargues for the presence of a hidden, “underground” lineage of adepts whohave kept the true wisdom alive through the ages; and understood nega-tively, it is based upon the sinister concept of demonic “dark brotherhoods”who, through the ages, have been conspiring against the religious and moralorder of society. Contrary to the second set, this one is compatible with ahistorical approach at least in theory. In practice, however, we are typicallydealing with the products of amateur scholarship, in which historical fan-tasies flourish due to a deficient use of sources and a lack of understandingabout the basics of historical criticism.

With justa few exceptions like Oxford and Halle, university libraries were unable tokeep their collections up to standard, and private libraries in places “wherethere was no Court, no university, and no great aristocrats” now developedinto powerful centers for the discussion of new ideas.248Furthermore,Europe during the final decades of the seventeenth century witnessed a“veritable mania” of encyclopedias, lexicons and dictionaries that madeintellectual discussion and new scientific knowledge available to the gen-eral public. Bayle’sDictionnaire(1697), Ephraim Chambers’Cyclopaedia(1728), Zedler’s stupendousGrosses vollst ̈andiges Universal-Lexicon(1732–1754), and of course Diderot’sEncyclop ́edie(1751–1772), along with manyless famous but similar works, all targeted a broad popular audience of“scholars and philosophers, certainly, but also the new ́elites of officials,diplomats, patricians, professionals, and courtiers, and even their wivesand daughters.”249Reaching all classes of society, and dominated by thenew philosophy and science, they have been called “a philosophical engineof war which massively invaded the libraries, public and private, of thewhole continent.”250And finally, there was the phenomenon of learnedjournals: “an even more powerful machine” of Enlightenment ideas, eventhough they tended towards more moderate Christian perspectives halfwaybetween traditional religion and the radical Enlightenment.251But there was an obvious flip side to the “media revolution” of the laterseventeenth and the eighteenth century. Following the laws of supply anddemand, it worked not just in favor of Enlightenment agendas, whetherradical or moderate, but also led to an unprecedented wave of popularliterature in the domains associated with “superstition,” “magic” and the“occult sciences.”252It did not matter that many authors or compilersof such publications professed a wish to expose the dangers or stupidityof superstition, or just wanted to amuse their readers: regardless of theirintentions, part of the public undoubtedly read them from a differentperspective, and took an interest in these materials for their own sake.The fact is that – in sharp contrast with popular images of the “Age of248Israel,Radical Enlightenment,131: “until around1750the large private library covering all fields wasone of the prime motors of the Enlightenment.”249Ibid.,135.250Ibid.,137.251Ibid.,142–155.

One is convinced that nature is filled withpowers, invisible spirits, and sylphs that can be at man’s disposal; that most of thephenomena of nature and all our actions can be reduced to hidden causes andto an order of unknown entities; that not enough credence is given to talismans,judicial astrology, and magical sciences; that our fates and destinies are determinedby particular spirits that guide us without our knowledge, by threads that we donot notice; and finally, that all of us, in this mean world, are really like marionettes,like ignorant and perfectly blind slaves. They strongly impress on everyone’s mindsthat it is time to be illuminated, that man must begin to enjoy his rights, shake offthe yoke of the invisible powers, and at least become conscious of who is directinghim. This taste for concealed things, with mystical and allegorical meanings, hasbecome ubiquitous in Paris and nowadays occupies almost all the well-to-do. Itis not a question of associations shrouded in great mystery. The lyceums, theclubs, the museums, the societies of harmony: all are sanctuaries where one canoccupy oneself only with abstract sciences. All books of secrets, all those that aredealing with the Great Work, with mystical and kabbalistic science, are in greatdemand.254This popular demand for occult literature continued right into the nine-teenth century. By1825, Collin de Plancy could speak hyperbolically of“twenty thousand volumes” on such “bizarre matters,” and although mostof it was little more, in his opinion, than “ridiculous heaps of extravagances,or imperfect compilations, or dry discussions without aim or coherence,”255the important point is that there was a large market for them.Most of those who catered to this demand were no longer intellectualprofessionals and academics but amateur scholars, or autodidacts. We haveseen that the intellectual elites had still been discussing “platonic-hermetic”253A well-known literary reference to the “superstitions” of Paris in the early eighteenth century isMontesquieu’sLettres Persanesno.58.

In other words, if the earlyChurch had once needed a concept of “heresy” (gnostic or otherwise) todefine its own “orthodox” identity, and Protestantism had needed the con-cept of a “pagan” opponent (Roman Catholic or otherwise) to define itsown identity as true Christianity, the newly developing academic ortho-doxies created reified “Others” more suitable to their own needs of self-definition: irrational “superstition” based on human ignorance, credulity,prejudice, and sheer stupidity in the case of Enlightenment philosophers,“alchemy” in the case of modern chemists, “astrology” in the case of mod-ern astronomers, “magic” and “occult philosophy” in the case of scientistsin general. In this manner the category of “the occult” emerged duringthis period as a conceptual waste-basket for “rejected knowledge,” andit has kept functioning as the academy’s radical “Other” to the presentday.256The near-complete dominance of amateur scholars from the eighteenthand through the nineteenth centuries had predictably negative results asregards the quality of research, and this in turn made the field look evenless respectable for academics. Most materials available in print duringthis period were lacking in any sense of historical criticism or scholarlycontextualization, and these failings were matched by an increasing stateof ignorance among professional scholars. The result of this combinationwas a self-reinforcing downward spiral: the lower the quality of printedinformation, the less reason for scholars to take an interest, but since everfewer of them knew anything about it, this meant that the book marketbecame even more dependent on dilettante scholarship, and so on. By thelater nineteenth century, it had become very hard for anybody to get reliableinformation about the actual nature, historical development, or culturalsignificance of “hermetic,” “magical” or “occult” ideas and traditions – butrather than experiencing this as a research hiatus, academic professionalswere more likely to take pride in not knowing anything about such things.Under these conditions, it was obviously hard to tell fiction apart from256The politics of identity that are basic to this process will be discussed at greater length in the Con-clusion.

Throughout the “age ofreason,” as in our own days, there was a flourishing market for pulp fictionand initiatic novels capitalizing on the theme of mysterious secret societies,kabbalists, Templar knights, dark magicians, and alchemical adepts.258Ofcentral importance for our concerns is an early example of this type ofliterature, which spawned an entire sub-genre of its own, and the influenceof which can be traced through the centuries: Nicolas Pierre Henri Mont-faucon de Villars’Comte de Gabalis, first published in1670and reprintedin numerous editions and translations up to the present.259The author, alibertine andabb ́edesalon,260lived a short but troubled life: condemnedto death, together with his sister and two brothers, for having murderedan uncle (in revenge for his murder of their father), he managed to avoidcapture but was killed by a relative on the road to Lyon in1673,attheage of thirty-five. Of the several novels that he managed to publish inhis lifetime,Comte de Gabaliswas an instant hit. For our concerns, it isimportant because of its remarkably innovative and extremely influentialconcept of “the occult.”The title is a clear reference to the paracelsian concept ofGabalia.According to Paracelsus, this term stood for the ancient “ars caballistica”:257Pasi (“Notion de magie,”95–102) likewise emphasizes the special importance of literary fiction,next to “works of erudition,” for conceptualizations of the occult in the nineteenth century.258See, for example, Bila,La croyance`alamagie; Thalmann,Trivialroman(badly written but extremelyuseful for its extensive documentation of esoteric dimensions in a forgotten sub-genre of popularliterature, and notable for its influence on Thomas Mann: see Hanegraaff, “Ironic Esotericism”);Faivre,L’ ́esot ́erisme au XVIIIe si`ecle,187–190; Faivre, “Gen`ese d’un genre narratif”; Verni`ere, “Unaspect de l’irrationnel.” This genre is a clear research desideratum: who still remembers authors likeCajetan Tschink (Geschichte eines Geistersehers,3vols.,1790–1793), Wilhelm Friedrich von Meyern(Dya-Na-Sore,3vols.,1787), or Veit Weber (“Die Teufelsbeschw ̈orung,” or “Br ̈uder des Bundes”inSagen der Vorzeit,1792), to give just a few random examples from Germany alone?259De Villars,Comte de Gabalis(and see now the critical edition by Didier Kahn,2010).

Female elementalsare far more beautiful than earthly women, they never develop “horriblewrinkles,” and they are all ready to throw themselves into the arms oftheir human saviors: “Think of the love and gratitude of these invisibleMistresses, & with how much passion they seek to please the charitablephilosopher who does his best to immortalize them.”268What is more, theyare not jealous among themselves, so human men are free to love as manyof them as they wish.269Very interestingly, theComte de Gabalisappearsto have adopted Cornelius Agrippa’s heretical belief that the Fall consistedin sexual intercourse,270but with a novel twist: Adam sinned by having sexwith another human being instead of with elementals! If he had chosenthe latter alternative, he would not have fallen, but would have produceda superior offspring of “heroes” and “giants” full of power and wisdom.265Ibid.,14.266Ibid.,23;cf.48about the “Catholic Kabbalistic Medicine.”267Paracelsus,S ̈amtliche Werke,Abt.1,vol.xiv,sect.7.

The erotic connotations are obvious, and go hand inhand with an implicit polemics against established Christianity and itssuppression of pagan nature-worship. The protagonist keeps protestingthat these elementals are in fact demons and pagan deities, but the Countalways responds that theologians have corrupted the truth by turning theelemental spirits of nature into evil demons. The so-called “fallen angels”who fell in love with the daughters of man were really elementals, andsuperior children (“giants”) were born from their union.272The storiesof witches, the sabbath, and incubi and succubi having intercourse withhuman beings are tragic distortions of the marriages between elements andhumans and their festive assemblies in honor of the “Sovereign Being.”273The elementals had also been behind the ancient pagan oracles; and thevoice lamenting the death of the great god Pan, famously recorded inPlutarch’sCessation of the Oracles, belonged to a sylph.274But the oracleshave returned:“And in what place of the world?,” I said. “In Paris,” he replied. “In Paris?,” Iexclaimed. “Yes, in Paris,” he continued. “You are a Master of Israel, & and youdo not know that? Doesn’t one consult the Water Oracles in glasses of water eachday; or in basins; & the Aerial Oracles in mirrors & in the hands of virgins?”275So the ancient spirits of the natural world – that is, the so-called pagandeities – are behind the popular practices of “superstitious” divination.Prominent in theComte de Gabalisare several oracles attributed to Por-phyry, and actually taken by Montfaucon de Villars from Agostino Steuco’sDe perenni philosophia:“Abovethecelestialfirethereisanincorruptibleflame, ever sparkling, the source of life, fountain of all beings, & principleof all things.

It hinted at secret organizations (never referredto as Rosicrucian, but easily recognizable as such) focused on the occultpractices of magic, astrology, alchemy, and contact with invisible spiritualbeings. At the core of these practices, it suggested, there was the prospect(in fact central to Agrippa’socculta philosophia) of a profound spiritualtransformation that reverses the effects of the Fall and makes it possible forman to regain the supra-human knowledge and power that had been hisoriginal birthright.277The underlying metaphysics was a platonic panen-theism directed towards\u001a\u0019\u0018\r\u0007 \u0005\u0019\u001a \u001a\u0005\u0016\u001a: the very perspective thatJacob Thomasius had highlighted, only five years earlier, as the doctrine atthe heart of all pagan heresy.278The combination with Paracelsianism andthe “occult sciences,” alchemy in particular, resulted in exactly the kindof “platonic-hermetic” religion that Colberg would attack in his founda-tional synthesis twenty years later. But to all these traditional notions, theComte de Gabalisadded something new, congenial to anti-clerical sen-timents among his readers: the notion of a superficially Christian butessentially pagan religion grounded in a profoundly spiritual “intercourse”withnature. In eroticizing the idea of contact between human beings andspiritual entities that inhabit the natural world, Villars had turned his novelinto a perfect reversal of the current witchcraft discourse. The Church haddistorted the truth by turning the benevolent spirits of nature into evildemons, prohibiting any contact with them as pagan idolatry, and reject-ing sex between humans and demons (incubi or succubi) as thenon plusultraof moral depravity.279But the Count of Gabalis defended exactly theopposite: he was denouncing “normal” sex as carnal practice that kept usin our fallen and sinful state, while praising “marriage” with the spirits ofnature as the royal road towards spiritual regeneration.We do not know whether Montfaucon de Villars just meant to write anamusing novel with a sexy theme, or may have had somewhat more seriousintentions: his protagonist seems to hover between skepticism and credulity,and never clearly makes up his mind. But readers certainly did. Withinten years, in1680, the first English translation was published in Londonby one “B. M.

Eventually, many occultists during the nineteenthand twentieth centuries became convinced that its author had been an“initiate” who revealed great secrets under the guise of fiction,284and someeven lent credence to popular jokes (shared, among others, by Voltaire)to the effect that he had been murdered by Rosicrucians or elementals aspunishment for revealing too much!285In the wake of Helena Blavatsky,occultists in the final decades of the nineteenth century began to report thatthey had themselves seen elementals, and some of them drew the ultimateconclusion: they began to experiment with ritual techniques for attractingand even marrying elementals.286280For example, de Villars,Count of Gabalis,169(Nagel, “Marriage with Elementals,”29; cf. McIntosh,Rosicrucians,108).281Pope,Poetical Works,87.282On Corneille’s comedyLa pierre philosophale(starring the Comte de Gabalis’ son, along with twoRosicrucians, all the four classes of elementals, plus “a speaking shadow”), see Kahn, “L’alchimiesur la sc`ene franc ̧aise,”66–76.283See the excellent analysis in Kilcher, “Orakel der Vernunft,” esp.192–193,196.284See for example the1913edition by “The Brothers,” with a foreword by one Lotus Dudley, whodescribed theComte de Gabalisas “a book of light,” whose pages stated “in terms of exact sciencethe goal and means of man’s finer or spiritual growth and identify his position and purpose inevolution.”285For example, Eliphas L ́evi,Histoire de la magie,i.7(in:Secrets de la magie,419).286Nagel, “Marriage with Elementals,”40–58; Greer,Women of the Golden Dawn,160–163. See espe-cially Blavatsky, “Thoughts on the Elementals,”181(Collected Writings,vol.xii,193: since it isundeniable that spirits can interact with the physical world, “why should not those same Spiritsperform matrimonial duties as well?” [emphasis in original]); ritual for attracting elementals repro-duced in Godwin, Chanel, and Deveney,Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor,109–120; correspondenceon elemental marriage in Howe,Magicians of the Golden Dawn,119–123. This entire developmentmay well have its origin in Georgy Henry Felt’s much-discussed lecture on “The Lost Canon ofProportion of the Egyptians” on September7,1875. Felt claimed to be able to make the elementalsvisible by means of a “chemical and kabbalistic” process, and it was in response to this lecture thatColonel Olcott seems to have conceived the idea of founding a Society “for this kind of study.”The eventual result was the Theosophical Society (Santucci, “Forgotten Magi,”132–138; Deveney,"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"228The error of historyTheComte de Gabalisand its remarkable reception history might seemmerely amusing at first sight, but are highly relevant if seen against the back-ground sketched in the introduction to this chapter: the widespread feel-ings of anxiety, among intellectuals and the general public, about whetherthe advances of the new science left any room for the presence of divineor spiritual forces in nature. Many Protestants, scientists and Enlighten-ment thinkers were arguing that the “disenchantment of the world” wouldliberate humanity from its unfounded fear of non-existent ghosts andwitchcraft practices. But for others, the presence of spiritual forces in thenatural world inspired positive feelings of awe and wonder, and whattheywere afraid of was alienation: the emptiness of a world of mere matterin motion, wholly indifferent – as famously expressed by Pascal287–tothe thoughts, hopes, or feelings of human beings. Much of esoteric andoccultist religion since the eighteenth century is grounded in the argumentthat a science leading to such a conclusion necessarily had to be false. Thus,the crucial occult novel of the nineteenth century (and most importantsequel toComte de Gabalis), Edward Bulwer-Lytton’sZanoni,288empha-sized a panvitalist cosmology with direct reference to the elemental beings,as a radical alternative to the specter of an empty universe as evoked byPascal:[C]an you conceive that space which is the Infinite itself is alone a waste, is alonelifeless, is less useful to the one design of universal being than the dead carcass of adog, than the peopled leaf, than the swarming globule?

From a humorous satire about “kabbalah,” the teachingsofComte de Gabaliswere turned into the paradigmpar excellenceof an“occult philosophy” of nature directed against the disenchantment of theworld. This feat was accomplished by what might be called an esoterichermeneutics of suspicion: occultists assumed that the adepts had been sosmart as to conceal their superior “kabbalistic” knowledge under the veilof a satire against themselves – and as usual, they concluded, this trick hadfooled everybody except the true initiates.If Montfaucon de Villars’ type of satire was just a bit too subtle toprevent such interpretations, there was nothing subtle about the intentionsof its most famous counterpart: theHistory of the Extravagant Imaginationsof Mr. Oufle,publishedin1710by yet anotherabb ́e, Laurent Bordelon.The very name of the protagonist, a transparent anagram of “le fou” (thefool), sets the tone: Mr. Oufle is the very archetype of the superstitiouserudite. He owns a big library devoted to demonology and the occultsciences (Bordelon provides a lengthy and very interesting list of titles)290and is ready to believe anything he reads, no matter how outrageous. Heis blind to reason and common sense, and keeps making a fool of himselfthroughout the novel because of his limitless credulity and utter inability tolearn from his mistakes. In a desperate last attempt to cure him of his folly,a letter is fabricated in which his own familiar spirit threatens him withthe worst if he does not stop practicing astrology. In this manner, Oufleis cured of one superstition by means of another one, but of course hereturns to his old habits as soon as he discovers the deception. It should benoted that there is nothing disconcerting or frightening about his persona:unlike many Enlightenment thinkers, Bordelon did not connect Oufle’sfolly with such serious factors as fear, fanaticism or mental illness, but justmade fun of his credulity and ignorance.291Even the main specialist of Bordelon admits his mediocrity,292but thepopularity ofMr. Oufle– it was often reprinted, and translated intoEnglish, German, and Italian293– made it an early classic in the “debunk-ing” genre. The book was not meant just for amusement: its author, an289Bulwer-Lytton,Zanoni,252–254.290Bordelon,L’histoire des imaginations,chapter2.291De la Harpe,L’abb ́e Laurent Bordelon,161–162.292Ibid.,197(“it must be admitted: his oeuvre leaves an incontestable impression of superficiality”).293Ibid.,199."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"230The error of historyenlightened cleric,294was using the fictional genre for explicit didactic pur-poses, inspired by serious worries about the dangers of superstition.

In spite of its satirical intentions, the formercreated a classic image of “the occult” as a mysterious science of transfor-mation, practiced by “adepts” and focused on the hidden forces and spiritsof nature; in the latter, the occult appeared quite simply as the summitof superstition and credulity. Both images would recur in non-fictionalcontexts as well.compendia of rejected knowledgeWe have seen that in the gradual shift from a dominantly theological to anEnlightenment perspective, superstition was transformed from a religiouserror into an intellectual one: from a sin it became a mistake, and theessence of the error was a failure to keep nature and the divine separate.As demonstrated by the case of Bordelon and countless other examples,Christian and rationalist commitments could easily join forces in the battleagainst “superstition,” “magic” or “the occult” – terms which now all cameto refer to the emerging waste-basket category of “rejected knowledge,” andtended to be used interchangeably. If Christian hardliners interpreted thebelief in spiritual presences in nature as paganism and idolatry, rationalistscould denounce the same belief as incompatible with new post-Cartesianperspectives in science and natural philosophy, and those who consideredthemselves enlightened Christians felt free to combine both perspectives.From the eighteenth century on, this development can be studied in anewly emerging genre of popular compendia intended to enlighten themasses about “the occult” and, eventually, similar reference works that nolonger tried to warn the public but rather sought to provide information,leaving it to the readers to make up their own minds or even trying toconvince them.The development of the genre can be traced most clearly in France.In1702, a generation after Jean-Baptiste Thiers’ normativeTrait ́edes294Ibid.,190–191."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Compendia of rejected knowledge231superstitions,295Pierre Le Brun (a member of the congregation of the Ora-tory of St. Philip Neri) published an equally influentialHistoire critiquedes pratiques superstitieuses, eventually followed by a greatly expanded sec-ond edition in three volumes that appeared posthumously in1732.296LeBrun’s work, preceded by a long series of endorsements by ecclesiasticalauthorities, was intended for Christians297and remained firmly rooted inthe theological doctrine of the Tridentine Church. Superstition was stilldefined along traditional lines as rooted in idolatrous worship,298and LeBrun was therefore free to demarcate it from legitimate belief in the pos-sibility of divine as well as demonic intervention. Inevitably, this led toconclusions that would be considered bizarre from an Enlightenment per-spective. For example, Le Brun had originally been led to his investigationsby an article on the dowsing rod in theJournal de Savansin1700,andhe discussed that topic through no fewer than seventeen chapters of hissecond volume, concluding that dowsing undoubtedly worked, but not bynatural causes: its effects therefore had to be attributed to demons.299ForEnlightenment critics such a conclusion alone would of course suffice tosee him as representative of the very error he claimed to be fighting, andthis in spite of all his attempts to use scientific argument wherever possible.For Le Brun himself, the “enchantment of the world” was evidently thevery heart of superstition. Following the now familiar narrative, he tracedit back to the ancient Oriental nations, who had misunderstood the beliefin “intelligent spirits” that they had received from the Hebrews. Their fun-damental mistake was that they had “placed these intelligences in almost allthe bodies,” so that they “found mystery everywhere.” Inevitably, this hadresulted in the idolatrous worship of spiritual presences in nature, and awhole range of “most absurd fables and most extravagant practices.”300ForLe Brun, the battle against “prejudice” in favor of “straight reason” impliedan attack on the credulous belief in the ancient authorities that kept beingquoted as historical sources: “how unpleasant to be always obliged to defythe Compilators & the Historians who have had a reputation in the world,”he complained, and went on to quote Seneca: “to be a historian & a liar isalmost the same thing.”301Having established these foundations in his firstbook, the rest of Le Brun’s work consisted in lengthy chapters devoted to295SeeLeBrun,“LeTrait ́e des superstitions”; Dompnier, “Les hommes d’ ́eglise,”22–28.296Dompnier, “Les hommes d’ ́eglise,”29–30.

Interestingly, alchemy is absent entirely; and apart from theirorigin in the ancient Orient, there was no further attempt to place thevarious “superstitions” in any historical context.Le Brun’s ambivalent attempts at using naturalist arguments within ageneral context dominated by traditional Christian demonology remainedvery much the norm in similar works during the rest of the century. Acertain De Saint-Andr ́e, a medical consultant of King Louis XV of France,published his much noted “Letters on Magic” in1725,andtheabb ́eClaude-Marie Guyon devoted the eighth volume of hisBiblioth`eque Eccl ́esiastique(1771) to the same domains, but although they were almost half a centuryapart, their approaches were still very similar. Both showed the influence ofGabriel Naud ́e, who in his well-knownApologie(1625, plus later editionsand translations) had defended a whole range of famous men against theaccusation of magic. Like Naud ́e, De Saint-Andr ́e and Guyon argued thatmany phenomena attributed to magic by the common people could infact be explained by purely natural causes; but both made a point ofemphasizing that supernatural causation and demonic intervention werenevertheless possible and real. They differed from Le Brun in adoptingAgrippa’s distinction between a pure and noble magic of the ancients thathad only later degenerated into “criminal and condemnable” practices.302For our concerns, the main point to be retained from these writings is thatthe “waste-basket category” of superstitious arts was now firmly in place.In Guyon’s formulation, his book was meant asa summary of what one should know about judicial astrology, the power of demons,the commerce that they can have with men, by means of the different forms ofmagic, about enchantments, marvels, amulets and talismans, prophecies, sorcery,dreams, the various ways by which men have tried to know the future, divinationand the ordeals of the Middle Ages . . .303As for De Saint-Andr ́e, at the end of his preface he announced that ifanyone were interested, he was ready to continue with even more letters,“on Ghosts, Phantoms, judicial Astrology, Talismans, the Philosophers’Stone, Sympathy, Antipathy, & some other things of this nature [de cettenature].”304The important point to notice is that his audience evidentlyno longer needed him to explain what was meant by “of this nature”:thatit somehow all hung together was clear to everyone, even though perhapsnone of his readers would be able to explain how and why.

The perspective was clearlyskeptical: Denis emphasized “the nothingness of the occult sciences” butargued that there is a certain value in looking back to “take an objectivelook at the fantastic edifice that has vanished into thin air before the lightsof civilization.”315During the earliest “childhood of humanity,” it had allbegun with dream interpretation and necromancy, followed by astrology,and finally magic. In the ancient cultures of India, Egypt or Chaldaea,what went by the name “magic” often had a basis in purely physical orchemical processes.316These ancient sciences of the Orient reached Europemainly due to the crusades, and Muslims in Spain had developed “thetaste for studying the occult sciences and the high kabbalah, which wasprobably cultivated by the Templars and whose principles were mingledwith those of the gnostics.”317The influence of the occult sciences hasbeen both negative and positive, for although much of it is based onsuperstition and credulity, they have also been a stimulant of genuinescience: “it is easy to understand how inspiring, to an exalted medievalspirit, must have been the idea that by studying the sciences, he wasentering step by step into an intimate contact with mysterious spirits whotransmitted to him divine thoughts about earthly things...”318Those whostudied the occult sciences deserve our respect, even though their ideas arefalse. And on these foundations, Denis then launches into a chapter-by-chapter description of divination and oracles, the kabbalah, faeries, magic,sorcery, demonology, and possession, leading finally to a roughly historicalchapter on “gnosticism, secret societies, illuminism, animal magnetism,314On Denis, his contacts and his sources, see Laurant,L’ ́esot ́erisme chr ́etien,65–69; and cf. the shortdiscussion in Pasi, “Notion de magie,”101–102.

Denis continues with a discussion ofthe various esoteric currents that had flourished since the later eighteenthcentury: illuminism, Swedenborgianism, and Mesmerism, finishing with achapter on the “hermetic philosophy” of alchemy and a demonstration thatthere are natural explanations for seemingly miraculous events. The finalparts of his volume contained an alphabetical list of biographical entries onthe “most illustrious men who have occupied themselves with the occultsciences,” an annotated bibliography, and an analytical vocabulary/index.About twenty years later, a more condensed overview based upon the samehistorical outline and approach to “the occult sciences” was publishedin the fourth volume of Paul Lacroix’s widely disseminatedMoyenˆage etRenaissance.321In the country of thephilosophesand the French Revolution, popu-lar compendia of the occult tended to be somewhat more polemical intone than across the Channel. The most prominent eighteenth-centuryauthor in this domain, Ebenezer Sibly, was even a convinced defender.From1784to1788he published a hugeNew and Complete Illustration ofthe Celestial Science of Astrologyin four volumes, later republished (pre-sumably for commercial reasons) asA New and Complete Illustration ofthe Occult Sciences;andin1792it was followed byA Key to Physic, andthe Occult Sciences, opening to Mental View the System of the Interior andExterior Heavens; the Analogy betwixt Angels and Spirits of Men; and theSympathy between Celestial and Terrestrial Bodies. As suggested by thevery title, Sibly was a very late heir of Renaissance polymaths like Athan-asius Kircher and Robert Fludd, but, interestingly, he was entirely famil-iar with the new scientific literature as well, and was seriously trying tocombine their perspectives.322In his personal life he worked as a physi-cian and was involved in Swedenborgianism and Freemasonry, and whilehis emphasis was very clearly on astrology, his large compilations gave319Ibid.,180.

It couldnot make any claim to originality other than for its hand-tinted portraitsof demons, but the book was a success. Its author, a shadowy entrepreneurbest known as a balloon adventurer,324offered the reader his services asa teacher in “Natural Philosophy, Natural Magic, the Cabala, Chemistry,the Talismanic Art, Hermetic Philosophy, Astrology, Physiognomy, &c.&c.” and “the Rites, Mysteries, Ceremonies, and Principles of the ancientPhilosophers,Magi, Cabalists, Adepts, &c.” Of course, the repeated “&c’s”once more reflect the waste-basket approach to things “of this nature.” Thepurpose of his school was “to investigate the hidden treasures of Nature; tobring the Mind to a contemplation of the Eternal Wisdom; to promote thediscovery of whatever may conduce to the perfection of Man . . . ”325Weknow of only one student, a Dr. John Parkins, but for later occultists thiswas enough to imagine Barrett as an important link in the initiatic chain bywhich the occult sciences were supposed to have been handed down fromthe Renaissance through the “dark ages” of the early nineteenth century tothe Victorian era.326A final name that must at least be mentioned here is Robert Cross Smith,an astrologer who published his works under the pseudonym “Raphael.”His case was similar to that of Sibly, in that his works were focused onastrology but in fact introduced their readers to a much wider domain of“occult sciences.” In1824, Smith started a magazine calledThe StragglingAstrologer, followed byUrania; or, the Astrologer’s Chronicle, and MysticalMagazine; and after both had failed, he began selling their contents asbooks. In spite of the title, hisAstrologer of the Nineteenth Century(1825)wasconcerned with the occult sciences in general, and with spirit invocations323Godwin,Theosophical Enlightenment,118; Hamill,Rosicrucian Seer,20–21; Pasi, “Notion de magie,”150–155.324King,Flying Sorcerer.325Barrett,The Magus,Bk.ii,140.326In the grey area of publications half way between occultism and scholarly research, one still findssuch ideas even today: see, for example, Butler, “Beyond Attribution,”9,21,24–25, who manages topraiseThe Magusas “one of the most original and valuable additions to western occultist literature”(ibid.,7) although even her own evidence demonstrates its derivative nature."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Secret traditions and hidden histories239in particular, and it has been called “the occult compendium of its time”next to Barrett’sMagus.327There would be no point to analyzing these and similar compendiain any further detail. In mentioning just some of the most well knownamong them, we have merely looked at the tip of an iceberg;328but if thegenre demonstrates anything, it is that the field now widely known as “theoccult” had lost all academic respectability, and had become an intellectualwasteland dominated by trivial literature meant for the largest audiencepossible. As mentioned earlier, its authors were typically autodidacts (onewould like to add “well-meaning,” but the fact is that many were just tryingto make money), and what they chose to publish was determined largely orexclusively by the demands of this particular niche in the popular readingmarket. Given that fact, a critical or historical approach to the massesof derivative information on “occult” beliefs and practices was not justunnecessary but unwanted: readers did (and still do) not buy such booksto learn, or to ask themselves difficult questions about the developmentof science, religion, or philosophy, but to be amused by bizarre facts andanecdotes, thrilled by stories about demons, excited at the vague idea thatthere might be something to magic after all, or intrigued by the suggestionthat it might be possible to know the future. At most, readers with amore intellectual or scholarly interest might browse through this literatureto satisfy themselves, like the scholarly pedant Wagner in Goethe’sFaust,about “wie wir’s denn zuletzt so herrlich weit gebracht” (“how wonderfullyfar we have come at last”). In short, these nineteenth-century compendiaof the occult represent the lowest ebb of “Western esotericism” as a possibletopic of intellectual exploration or academic interest.

As we have seen, alchemists andfreemasons shared a strong interest in the historical origins of their respec-tive crafts, and both were trying to recover a “lost secret” that had beenknown to the ancients. It was therefore logical for them to develop aspecial interest in how those ancient secrets had been passed on throughhistory, and their overviews could serve as a model for historiographiesof “the occult.” A history of the separate historiographies of alchemy orFreemasonry (and of other fields, such as astrology) falls beyond the scopeof this study, but it is important for us to take a brief look at the generalmodels that they bequeathed to later authors with a more comprehensiveagenda.The outstanding eighteenth-century example of a history of alchemywas Nicolas Lenglet Dufresnoy’s three-volumeHistoire de la philosophieherm ́etique, first published in1742and reprinted twice in1744. Inter-estingly, it was intended as the prequel of a much larger work on thehistory of philosophy, philosophers, and their opinions, which never sawthe light of day.330Lenglet was a learned ́erudit and former diplomat wholeft a large oeuvre mainly on historical and geographical topics, and hehad republished Jean Maugin de Richebourg’s important collectionBib-lioth`eque des philosophes chimiquesone year before.331He claimed, withsome exaggeration, to be the first author ever to have written a “historyof hermetic philosophy”: “the learned [sc ̧avans] who busy themselves withhistory distrust everything that has to do with this science, and rightly so;& the philosophers, occupied exclusively with their operations, neglect itshistory & confuse all the terms.”332Lenglet, for his part, was addressingthose among the general public who might want to satisfy their curiosityand amuse themselves by learning about the “illustrious fools” who hadoccupied themselves with alchemy.333Lenglet’s historical overview was quite unremarkable in itself. Still firmlygrounded in biblical chronology, and attempting (in vain) to make sense of329The important exception to this rule – historical overviews that constructed “magic” as the historicalprecedent for mesmerism – will be discussed separately inChapter4.330Lenglet Dufresnoy,Histoire,vol.i,iv.331On Lenglet Dufresnoy and his alchemical writings, see Sheridan,Nicolas Lenglet Dufresnoy,178–187; Debus, “French Alchemy in the Early Enlightenment,”51–55(repr.2006,416–419).332Lenglet Dufresnoy,Histoire,vol.i, iii; cf.

From late antiquity on, the narra-tive turns into an author-by-author description of the major alchemists,culminating in the seventeenth century, “the century of folly,”334whenthe mad dreams of alchemy begin to carry their fruits to the fullest. Inspite of many disparaging remarks of this kind, contemporary reviewersnoticed, quite correctly, that Lenglet’s attitude to alchemy was in fact ratherambiguous:It is true that, from time to time, he insinuates that this hermetic Philosophy isfalse, chimerical and ruinous. But more often, he presents it to us as a sublimescience, and as an admirable art, and the great work as something real. Accordingly,it is not easy to know what the Author thinks of this metallic transmutation, whichmodern physics judges to be impossible. Sometimes he takes the trouble to refutewhat is being said against the vain arguments of the Alchemists. If he is a partisanof the hermetic philosophy, he does not say so sufficiently, and if he disdains it,his disdain is not clear enough: sometimes he mentions the pros, sometimes thecons, which is not agreeable to all readers.335Hence the difference was not so very great with the perspective of a con-vinced “adept” like Antoine-Joseph Pernety, in hisFables Egyptiennes etGrecques d ́evoil ́ees et r ́eduites au mˆeme principe(1758), where he alluded tothe universal medicine, “this treasure,” “fruit of life,” “remedy to all ills”that had been known already to the first philosophers.336The secret knowl-edge about it had been passed on from Hermes Trismegistus to the Druids,Gymnosophists,Magi, Chaldaeans, Homer, Thales, Orpheus, Pythagoras,and so on; and to be able to pass it on without revealing the true secret,they had all used hieroglyphs, symbols, allegories, and fables.337Masonic historiographies were similar in that they, too, liked to tracethe secret knowledge to the Orient and as far back into history as possible,334Ibid.,322.335Review inObservations sur les ́ecrits modernes28(1742),190–191, here quoted according to Sheridan,Nicolas Lenglet Dufresnoy,181.

As moreinformation became available about India and its religions since the earlynineteenth century, it became possible for masonic authors to push theoriental origins of the order even further eastward; and as the antagonismbetween Freemasonry and Roman Catholicism (the Jesuit order in particu-lar) grew stronger, the gnostic and Manichaean heretics moved increasinglyinto the picture as well: according to the logic of “my enemy’s enemy is myfriend,” the more they were demonized by Catholics, the more attractivethey were bound to become for masons.338If the concept of “secret societies through the ages” had its origin inFreemasonic attempts to construct a pedigree for the Craft, it eventuallygot divorced from masonic agendas and developed into an autonomoussub-genre of its own. Its foundational classic,The Secret Societies of AllAges and Countries, was published by Charles William Heckethorn in1875(revised and expanded edn1896), but was in fact modeled upon alarge Italian work,Il mondo secreto(fifteen books in nine volumes) pub-lished by Giovanni de Castro in1864. De Castro began with the “ancientinitiations” (the ZoroastrianMagi, the Mithras cult, the Brahmans andGymnosophists, Egyptian and Eleusinian mysteries, and so on) and the“Christian initiations” (from the Essenes and Therapeutae to Jesus him-self ), continuing with the “emanationist” schools of the kabbalah andthe gnostics, medieval currents like the Cathars, the Templars and theIsmaelites, moving on from there to the alchemists and Rosicrucians, soas to finally reach Freemasonry, which was clearly the heart and cen-ter of his work. Having discussed its various manifestations over severalvolumes, he continued with other “secret societies,” such as the Martin-ists, the Illuminati, the Carbonari, and a variety of smaller Italian sects.338Some examples of the genre are Marconis de N`egre’sSanctuaire de Memphis ou Herm`es,whichimagined the first initiations as having taken place on “the banks of the Ganges and the Nile,” andaccorded a central role to Mani (identified with Hiram); Ragon de Bettignies’Mac ̧onnerie occulte(published as the second part ofOrthodoxie mac ̧onnique), which emphasized that the masonicsecret was alchemical in nature (ibid.,3–5,418); or, from a later period, John Yarker’sThe ArcaneSchools, which shows a clear influence of then current theories about “Indo-Aryan” culture."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Secret traditions and hidden histories243Heckethorn – an English bibliophile, probably of Swiss descent, whoearned his living as an estate agent339– claimed that his own work began asa translation of de Castro, but had “speedily assumed a more independentform” as he decided to delete parts of the original and add many new sec-tions to it.340In so doing, he in fact changed the entire concept of de Castro’swork, which evolved under his hands from a history of predecessors anddescendants of Freemasonry into a general overview of each and every secretsociety about which he could find some information, including the Thugs,the Mafia, the Ku-Klux-Klan, or the Jesuits, but also German and FrenchWorkmen’s Unions, anarchist and nihilist societies, the “Know-Nothings,”African Hemp-smokers, “Mumbo-Jumbo,” “Wahabees,” and so on and soforth. Many similar overviews of “secret societies of all times and places”have been published ever since.341Their relevance for our concerns con-sists mainly in the fact that such works added considerable plausibility tothe general idea that “Western esotericism” could be described in terms ofsecret organizations or hidden brotherhoods.Outside the sphere of masonic publication, however, that idea remainedno more than a vague suggestion at best, and this has much to do with theremarkable influence of Roman Catholic perspectives on French occultismin the nineteenth century. In this regard, it is useful to adopt Joscelyn God-win’s distinction between an “occultism of the left” and an “occultism of theright.”342As described in Godwin’s groundbreaking studyThe TheosophicalEnlightenment, occultism in the English-speaking world was very stronglyindebted to an anti-Christian mythographical tradition grounded in thework of Enlightenment libertines, who had argued that religion had its ori-gin not in divine revelation but in a “natural religion” of solar worship andphallicism. It was on these intellectual foundations that spiritualists likeEmma Hardinge Britten and occultists like Helena P. Blavatsky developedtheir idiosyncratic forms of “comparative religion” as an alternative for tra-ditional Christian narratives.343Godwin’s “occultism of the left” was hostile339For the scanty biographical information on him, see Eve Juster’s Introduction to the1965editionof Heckethorn,Secret Societies,vol.i, ix–xi.340Ibid., vol.i, xxiii.341For example Schuster,Die geheimen Gesellschaften; Lepper,Famous Secret Societies; Peuckert,Geheim-Kulte; Frenschkowski,Die Geheimb ̈unde.342Godwin,Theosophical Enlightenment,204.343Godwin,Theosophical Enlightenment,passim.

Born in poor circumstances, Constant had attended seminary tostudy for the priesthood, but never made it to the ordination due to aseries of events and conflicts that have been described by his biographersbut do not need to detain us here.346Suffice it to say that, during thefirst part of his life, he maintained a highly complex relation with theChurch, while at the same time getting involved in various movementsworking for social and political reform: his socialist and utopian writings,including high-minded ideals about the emancipation of woman, led toconflicts with the authorities and several prison sentences.

Like the main academic scholar of kabbalah in Franceat this time, Adolphe Franck,349L ́evi did not see it as a specifically Jewishphenomenon: along the lines of a Christian kabbalah on patristic founda-tions, he described it as the direct reflection of theLogosthat has createdthe world according the Gospel of John. On the highest level of creation,kabbalah manifests itself as a symbolism of numbers; and their meaningand dynamics can serve as a universal hermeneutic key at all lower ontolog-ical levels of reality, according to the logic of correspondences or universalanalogy.What makes L ́evi’s work intellectually interesting is the fact that he doesnot present magic and kabbalah dualistically, as a counterculture againstChristianity (let alone a “secret tradition” of initiates), but dialectically, asthe hidden truth of Roman Catholicism which both revealsandconcealsitself in the verycoincidentia oppositorumof light and darkness. L ́evi’sbasic law of equilibrium (the law of two) implies, as he often repeats,that there can be no truth without error, no light without darkness, andno concept of God without a concept of Satan. The hidden unity of thedivine is revealed to us under the sign of the ternary, L ́evi’snumberof“manifestation,” and obviously linked to the Trinity, which paradoxicallyreconciles these opposites without sacrificing either one of them to theother. It is only from the divine perspective of absolute Unity that allthese dualities are mysteriously resolved. The temptation for us as creaturalbeings is to misunderstand the law of equilibrium and thereby lapse into347My earlier remarks on the lack of academic expertise in the nineteenth century are illustrated bythe fact that L ́evi was apparently seen as an authority even outside occultist circles, as he was askedto contribute articles on kabbalah and Knorr von Rosenroth to a reference work as famous as theLarousse(see Kilcher, “Verh ̈ullung und Enth ̈ullung,”354–355).348For an analysis of L ́evi’s oeuvre, see Hanegraaff, “Beginnings of Occultist Kabbalah.”349For Franck’s concept of a “universal kabbalah” with Persian/Zoroastrian rather than Jewish origins,and the resonances of his perspective with the Martinist current of Papus (G ́erard Encausse), seeHanegraaff, “Beginnings,”111–118."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"246The error of historya Manichaean dualism of good and evil as independent absolutes. Becausethe dualistic doctrine destroys the very law of equilibrium, it necessarilydestroys the very unity of the divine, of reality, and of truth as well. It isagainst this fundamental heresy of heresies, L ́evi argues, that the Churchhas defended its trinitarian doctrine, grounded in unity and the universallaw of equilibrium.From this perspective it becomes much easier to understand the internallogic that governs L ́evi’s history of magic. Like Adolphe Franck, but fordifferent reasons, L ́evi traced magic and the true kabbalah (which to himwere one and the same) to Zoroaster; but he distinguished the latter from asecondZoroaster, the inventor of the material fire-cult and of the “impiousdogma of divine dualism,” who is ultimately responsible for the later declineof true magic.350This topos of the two Zoroasters was an old one, but L ́evi’suse of it was new.351If the false Zoroaster was the father of materialismand dualism, the true Zoroaster was his exact opposite. The former taughtthe cult of material fire, but the latter revealed what L ́evi referred to as a“transcendental pyrotechnique,”352focused on the great agent of magic: auniversal invisible fluid called the astral light. L ́evi supported this view byextensive quotations in French from Francesco Patrizi’sMagia philosophica(1593),353which contains a Latin translation of theChaldaean Oracles.Asalate believer in Gemistos Plethon’s attribution of theChaldaean Oraclesto(the true) Zoroaster, it was easy for L ́evi to conclude that when Abrahamleft Ur of the Chaldaeans, he must have taken the Zoroastrian kabbalahwith him, and this is how it entered Jewish culture. The doctrine alsospread to Egypt, where it was translated into the hieroglyphic language ofimages and symbols, leading to an elaborate science of correspondencesbetween gods, letters, ideas, numbers, and signs; and just as Abraham hadsaved the doctrine before it began to degenerate in Chaldaea, Moses didthe same for Egypt. This is how the kabbalah became the hidden doctrineof the Hebrew Bible.And then everything changed. “[A] breath of charity descended fromthe sky,”354L ́evi writes, with the birth of Christ. From that moment on,the magic of the “ancient world” became obsolete: “a sad beauty spreadoveritsdeadremains...acoldbeautywithoutlife.”355And as for Judaism:just like Rachel died at the birth of her youngest son Benjamin, the birth350L ́evi,Histoire de la magie,in:Secrets,383.351Stausberg,Faszination Zarathushtra,334.352L ́evi,Histoire de la magie,in:Secrets,383–384.353Ibid.,384–385.

As a logical result, the rest of L ́evi’s history of magic turns out tobe essentially a history of heresies: the teachings of the false Zoroaster livedon in such currents as gnosticism and the Order of the Knights Templar,in witchcraft and black sorcery, and in various kinds of ecstatic cults up toand including the contemporary current of spiritualism. In other words:Eliphas L ́evi, who is often regarded as the founding father of occultism, didnotdefend any concept of “secret traditions” or underground organizationsthat had kept the truth alive against the suppression of the Church. Onthe contrary, he maintained that only Roman Catholicism itself has beenthe legitimate carrier of kabbalah and true magic since its very origins,and all competitors were sectarian heretics by definition. However, thetrue nature of Catholicism still remained hidden even to its adherents:“Considered as the perfect, realized and living expression of kabbalah,that is to say, of the ancient tradition, Christianity is still unknown, andthat is why the kabbalistic and prophetic book of the Apocalypse remainsunexplained. Without the kabbalistic keys, it is perfectly inexplicable,because incomprehensible.”357In other words: there is no such thing asa secret tradition of initiatic organizations, but there does exist a hidden,secret, “esoteric” dimension to the exoteric church, and by preaching thegreat “dogma” of kabbalah and magic, L ́evi was trying to lead his readers tothe one universal truth of Roman Catholicism as he saw it. This is why hisHistoire de la magieeven contains several formal declarations of submissionto the authority of the Church,358and his laterCl ́ef des grands myst`eresabounds in references to the absolute truth of hierarchical authority.Eliphas L ́evi’s works were introduced to the English-speaking worldthrough the translations of Arthur Edward Waite, who, unfortunately,misunderstood them on a basic level and thereby bequeathed a warpedinterpretation to his occultist readers and the general public.359Waiteseems to have had no antenna for the dialectical nature of L ́evi’s thinking,356Ibid.,461.357Ibid.,458.Cf.L ́evi,Clef,in:Secrets,865: “The Catholic dogma comes entirely from the kabbalah,but under how may veils and with what strange modifications!”358L ́evi,Histoire,in:Secrets,358(“we submit our work in its entirety to the supreme judgment ofthe Church”),421(“We do not dogmatize, we submit our observations and our studies to thelegitimate authorities”),481(“We pretend here neither to deny not to affirm the tradition of thefall of the angels, referring as always, in matter of faith, to the supreme and infallible decisions ofthe holy catholic, apostolic, and roman Church”).359See the “Biographical and Critical Essay” in Waite,Mysteries of Magic; see also the Preface to hislater translation of L ́evi,History of Magic."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"248The error of historyand perceived a great contradiction in the fact that after first presentinghimself as “an initiate in possession of the Great Arcanum,” the Frenchmagus was trying in his later works “to stultify himself by attempting topose as a faithful and humble child of the Catholic Church.”360However,the underlying assumption that L ́evi’s “magical” or “kabbalistic” beliefs hadto be heretical from a Catholic perspective, thereby forcing him to makea choice, is unwarranted in view of our discussions inChapter1:theseoccultist beliefs might be perceived as incompatible with Christian ortho-doxy by nineteenth-century outsiders, but we have seen that a Catholic likeConstant, whose seminary training had made him familiar with patristictradition, could provide excellent arguments for defending their orthodoxy.Arthur Edward Waite’s failure to grasp L ́evi’s perspective is all the moreinteresting because his own belief in a “Secret Tradition” was ultimatelycloser to his French counterpart than might appear at first sight. Morethan any other author in the English-speaking world, this scholarly auto-didact, poet, occultist and self-made mystic has been responsible for estab-lishing and popularizing the concept of an “esoteric tradition” in Westernculture,361by means of an impressive series of large and erudite books, pub-lished from the mid-1880s through the1930s, on the history of alchemy,magic, kabbalah, mysticism, Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, the Tarot, andthe Graal legend, plus many editions and translations of sources.362Assummarized by Waite’s biographer,During his years of multifarious reading at the British Museum, Waite had acquiredan immense fund of knowledge on the history and practice of the occult sciences,and in the late1880s he began to put it to good use. He realized that if hisspeculative writing was to be taken seriously he must first establish a reputationamong the “occult” public as a sound scholar; he must do what had not previouslybeen done in the field of occultism – he must write carefully reasoned historical360Wa i t e ,Mysteries of Magic,12, and discussion on the following pages.

Studies, moreover, that quoted original sources and arguedfrom established facts to rational conclusions – a method of working quite alien tothe occultists who were (as they still are) in the habit of setting out preconceivedopinions and selecting just those facts to support them as required the least amountof distortion.363In the absence of any serious competitors, Waite’s prodigious output didmake him the virtually unavoidable authority, until far into the twentiethcentury, for anybody who wished to place the various currents associatedwith “the occult” in some kind of historical framework. To assess Waite’sachievements fairly, one must recognize that his schooling was minimal,he never attended university, and had virtually no models or predecessorsfor his detailed historical studies in what he himself preferred to call “theSecret Tradition” of the West. One can therefore have respect for his labors,even while acknowledging that his legacy is highly problematic. DiscussingWaite’s editions of alchemical treatises, Principe and Newman concludethat[t]hey are almost invariably based upon corrupt editions and offer texts butcheredto unrecognizability by the silent excision of large portions of material and adul-terated by the addition of occultist elements and slants completely alien to theoriginals. The fact that there are in many cases no other modern translations withwhich to compare or replace them has intensified their ill effects over time. Waite’scorrupt translations were used regularly by historians of science until the middleof [the twentieth] century, as witnessed by their frequent citation in articles inAmbixandIsis, as well as in scholarly books; some authors still continue to referto them. Nearly all have been reprinted and are currently available in inexpensiveeditions.364More even than on Waite’s failings, this criticism is a reflection on theremarkable extent to which the scholarly study of alchemy was still beingneglected by the academy: the fact is that enthusiastic autodidacts likeWaite were doing the work that should have been done by philologicallytrained historians, and the result of this neglect was a flood of unreliable andmisleading publications that still keep influencing popular and academicperceptions of the field. For another central domain, that of kabbalah, thesituation was very much the same, as remarked by Gershom Scholem inhis ground-breakingMajor Trends in Jewish Mysticism:It is not to the credit of Jewish scholarship that the works of the few writers whowere really informed on the subject were never printed, and in some cases were noteven recorded, since there was nobody to take an interest.

[I]tis all the more regrettable that [Waite’sSecret Doctrine in Israel]ismarredbyanuncritical attitude towards facts of history and philology . . .365In spite of the millions of words that he devoted to its outward manifesta-tions, Waite’s ideas about “the Secret Tradition” are not so easy to discern.His strange, difficult and ponderous style of writing, his infuriatingly vagueway of referring to what he saw as the mysterious reality at work in religioushistory, his continuous revisions of earlier writings, the fact that he neverattempted a synthetic overview of “the Secret Tradition” as a whole, andhis refusal to disclose his intimate thought and its development over time,even in his autobiographicalShadows of Life and Thought, are factors thatall conspire to keep his basic perspective frustratingly elusive. After havingknown him for thirty-eight years, even his close friend Arthur Machen hadto admit “I have not the faintest notion as to his real beliefs.”366One ofWaite’s clearest statements appears in his autobiography:Ibelievetothisday...thatthereisaChurchbehindtheChurchonamoreinwardplane of being; and that it is formed of those who have opened the iridescent shellof external doctrine and have found that which abides within it. It is a Church ofmore worlds than one, for some of the Community are among us here and nowand some are in a stage beyond the threshold of the physical senses.367At least in his mature years, Waite does not seem to have thought of the“Secret Tradition” as some esoteric school or initiatory organization. Rather,he saw it as the invisible community of all those – in this life or the next –who were striving to reverse the fall from divine union by means of interiorregeneration, or had achieved that goal. He referred to the latter categoryas the “Holy Assembly,” and saw it as working in a hidden, “inward” man-ner through historical traditions such as alchemy or kabbalah. Waite wasraised as a Catholic and had a great love of ceremony, but did not believethat the “exoteric” church – or any other organization – possessed the365Scholem,Major Trends,2,212.366Arthur Machen to Colin Summerford (1925), quoted in Gilbert,A.

Even today, it remains a very significant factor in the grey area of writ-ings halfway between esoteric religiosity and strictly academic research.Its basic assumption is that the term “esotericism” refers not primarilyto initiatic organizations (although these may be included too), but to the“inner” spiritual dimensions that are believed to be discreetly present underthe surface of “exoteric” traditions. The implicit concept of two parallel“planes of reality” was crucial to the worldview of Victorian occultism andhas remained a bedrock of occultist belief and practice to the present day.As explained by the anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann in her seminal studyPersuasions of the Witch’s Craft, its significance lies in the fact that it allowsmodern occultists to accept the limitations of a thoroughly disenchantedworld ruled by the laws of physics: by means of ritual and symbols, they canalways make a temporary escape from its restrictions to a “magical plane,”ruled by the laws of the imagination. In other words: the dissipation ofmystery inthisworld is compensated for by a separate magical world ofthe reified imagination, where the everyday rules of science and rationalitydo not apply,369and this is how occultists manage to secure a “place ofenchantment” in a disenchanted world.370We will encounter a very similar perspective in the work of Carl GustavJung and some other scholars associated with Eranos, and its significancefor the study of Western esotericism will be discussed inChapter4.Atthis point, all that needs to be emphasized is the impact that ArthurEdward Waite’s voluminous oeuvre has had on how that field has beenperceived by enthusiasts as well as scholars in the English-speaking world.

More than almost anyone else in his generation, hewas making a sincere and persistent effort to establish standards of criticalhistoriographical research; but although the quality of his work improvedas he developed a more critical attitude in his later writings,371he still failedto do so in a manner that could satisfy professionals.

The process known since Max Weber as“disenchantment” – the disappearance of “mysterious and incalculable”forces from the natural world – is of absolutely central importance in thisnew context, as we have seen throughout this chapter. Major examples arethe Enlightenment reinterpretation of superstition, which from fear andworship of pagan deities and demons active in this world became redefinedas an intellectual failure to keep nature and the divine separate; the com-plicated development ofmagia naturalis, from a concept meant to protectthe study of the ancient natural sciences from theological censure into an“animistic” or “participatory” worldview that divinized nature itself andendowed it with spiritual or even divine powers and presences, therebyrendering it unacceptable for adherents of the new science; the paralleldevelopment of “occult qualities” from the black box of scholastic natural-ism into the privileged sanctuary of the divine within the natural world,371This is acknowledged by Principe and Newman in their discussion of Waite’sSecret Tradition inAlchemyof1926: “a degree of skepticism and historical discretion appears,” and it even looks as if“the occultist has marvelously transmuted himself into a positivist” (“Some Problems,”395)."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The Waste Land253studied by what came to be known as the “occult sciences” as an alternativeto the new scientific disciplines; the fundamental ambiguity of alchemicaltransmutation, hovering between its status as an experimental science andits common perception as involving a spiritual process by which Man andeven Nature itself could be “regenerated” from their fallen state and restoredto their original bodily-spiritual perfection; the belief that such a “science”of spiritual regeneration had been known to the ancients and pursued bysecret societies through the centuries; the fictional reversal of traditionaldemonology by which incubi and succubi were transformed into elementalbeings through which one might actually enjoy an intimate “intercoursewith nature”; or the late nineteenth-century idea of a “magical plane” ruledby the laws of the imagination, corresponding as a separate, parallel realitywith the “physical plane” ruled by physics and thus providing a means ofescape from the disenchanted world.To recognize the true significance of the disenchantment process, itis useful to return for a moment to Max Weber’s original formulations.Having pointed out to his audience that “the savage” has a better knowledgeabout the working tools or processes of exchange on which his life depends,than we do about the functioning of our tramlines or our economy, hecontinued as follows:Increasing intellectualization and rationalization . . . doesnotmean an increasinggeneral knowledge concerning one’s conditions of life. It means something differ-ent: the knowledge, or faith, that if only onewishedto, one could always find out;hence, that as a matter of principle, there are no mysterious incalculable powersthat play into it; but rather, that – as a matter of principle – one canhave powerover all things by means ofcalculation. That, however, means the disenchantmentof the world. No longer does one need – like the savage, for whom such powersdid exist – to have recourse to magical means to gain power over the spirits orpray to them. Technical instruments and calculation are doing the job. This is theprincipal meaning of intellectualization as such.372The indispensable foundation of modern natural science does indeed con-sist in the conviction that, in principle and by definition, nothing in thenatural world can be essentially “mysterious” and “incalculable,” that is to372We b e r,Wissenschaft als Beruf,9. Weber’s matter-of-course references to “the savage” and “magic” asthe counterpart to rationalization and disenchantment are obvious examples of the type of discoursecriticized in my section on magic, with primary reference to Randall Styers’ work. This does not,however, invalidate the correctness of his observations about the nature of “disenchantment”: onecan support his analysis without subscribing to asui generisconcept of “magic” as opposed to“science” or “religion.”"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"254The error of historysay, forever out of reach for intellectual understanding and human control.In very general terms, the conceptualization of “Western esotericism” thattook place in the wake of the Enlightenment, and continued in the twenti-eth century, can be seen as a direct outcome of the disenchantment processas formulated by Weber. As a “waste-basket category” of exclusion, it con-tained everything now seen as incompatible with a disenchanted worldviewgrounded in science and rationality; but by the same token, the categorycame to be reified as a positive counter-tradition of enchantment (or, even-tually, re-enchantment) by those who felt that the evaporation of mysteryemptied the world of any deeper meaning. It is significant, in this regard,that the famous definition of Western esotericism as a “form of thought,”presented by Antoine Faivre in1992(and to which we will return) reads likea definition of “enchantment”: the notion of “correspondences” is clearlyan alternative to instrumental causality, “living nature” stands against amechanistic worldview, “imagination/mediations” implies a multi-leveledneoplatonic cosmology as opposed to a cosmos reducible to only matterin motion, and “transmutation” implies the theosophical/alchemical pro-cess of regeneration by which fallen man and nature are reunited with thedivine.Modernization is therefore the key to understanding the emergence ofWestern esotericism (or whatever alternative term one might prefer) as aconcept or a category in the study of Western culture. Understood in termsof disenchantment, the core identity of modern post-Enlightenment soci-ety and its appointed representatives (such as, notably, academics)requiresand presupposesa negative counter-category consisting of currents, practicesand ideas that refuse to accept the disappearance of incalculable mysteryfrom the world. Moreover, the new science and post-Enlightenment soci-ety define themselves as “modern” by way of contrast with any appeal tothe authority of “ancient wisdom.” This combination makes the domainnowadays known as “Western esotericism” into much more than just acollection of currents and ideas that happen to have been neglected oroverlooked: rather, by being conceptualized as “the Other of science andrationality” it functions as the dark canvas of presumed backwardness,ignorance or irrationality that modernity needs in order to paint the out-lines of its own identity in shining colors of light and truth.

All thishappened because countless thinkers and activists were willing to attemptwhat no adherent of the ancient wisdom narrative could ever have consid-ered: to ignore tradition and start from scratch.It is important to prevent misunderstandings about the nature of therelation between “tradition” and “innovation” in the context of Westernesotericism. Contrary to the stereotype that sees them as inherently staticand“resistanttochange”–akindofinsulatedanomaly,somehowexemptfrom history and time – the various intellectual currents and practicesassociated with magic and the occult have always gone through processesof creative development, transformation, and innovation.3In this regardthey are, of course, like any other product of human culture. However, nomatter how creative their representatives may have been, they never sawthemselves as making a new start and heading in an entirely new directiontowards an unknown future. On the contrary, those who followed thelogic of a “platonic paradigm”4sought to restore the ancient wisdom,return to a universal tradition, recover forgotten secrets, or find the wayback to a lost unity. And even the more linear, dynamic, process-orientedlogic of the alternative “alchemical” paradigm implied that any process –including history – had to be conceived of as an organic unfolding ofpre-existing potentials or seeds that predetermined its possible outcomes.Jacob Thomasius was even more right than he probably realized himself:concepts ofcreatio ex nihilohave always been alien to Western esotericmodes of thought.Modern culture, in sharp contrast, is grounded in an acute awareness ofits own historical novelty and uniqueness. It is impossible to think of oursecular and democratic mass societies, with their enormous technologicalachievements, in terms of restitution, return, or even transformation orunfoldment: in essential respects they are a new phenomenon for whichno traditional script was available, and that developed as a revolution, orseries of revolutions, rather than an organic development from previous3See above,Chapter3,pp.184–189(with reference to Brian Vickers).4For my distinction between a “Platonic” and an “Alchemical” paradigm, see above,Chapter3,pp.192–195."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The truth of history259conditions.

Even if we are notconvinced that modern society and its dominant values are to be preferredover the past, we still know that we haveprogressedin the literal sense ofthe word–“moved forward,” or “advanced” – towards something that hadnever existed before, and are on our way towards an uncertain future forwhich no historical models are available either.Such a perspective is capable of inspiring positive feelings of freedom,even exhilaration: as human beings we are not conditioned by the pastbut can always start over again, we therefore have unlimited possibilitiesaheadofus,anditisuptoustoshapeourfuture!However,itcanalsolead to feelings of disorientation, anxiety, and spiritual malaise: if we donot know from where we have come, where we are going, or whether weare going anywhere at all, then history becomes meaningless and futile –a pointless series of random events that might as well have happeneddifferently, without any deeper significance, goal, or direction, beginningwith nothing and leading nowhere, for no particular reason at all. Manymodern thinkers have attempted to avoid such nihilist conclusions, andesotericism is an important part of that story.5In this fourth and finalchapter, we will see how high-level intellectuals and academics inspiredby modern esoteric traditions, and much else besides, developed new andhighly influential scholarly perspectives as antidotes against the course ofmodern history and the world that had been its result. These new theoreticalframeworks have been enormously successful in the study of religion afterWorld War II, and are essential to the emergence of Western esotericismas a field of academic research in that same period.The cultural impact of these new theories is easy to understand: cre-ated by some of the great minds of twentieth-century intellectual culture,their conceptualizations were sophisticated, sometimes brilliantly creative,and emotionally appealing to readers in search of a deeper meaning inhuman existence. Nevertheless, we will be forced to draw a disappointingconclusion: whatever other virtues they may have, most of these theoret-ical approaches are inadequate as a framework for historical research, andhence unsuitable as a foundation for the study of Western esotericism.

He had published a new scientific theory that he con-sidered revolutionary in its implications, but his colleagues had reactedwith cold indifference. Hurt and disappointed, he now wondered whatto do.A devouring fire filled my entire soul. I was searching for the truth no longer fullof tender devotion – I was searching for it full of the extremest unrest. Only fields,woods and the most remote wildernesses still appealed to me. There I felt closer toNature. In my most vehement emotions I sometimes believed that my heart, tiredof having been seduced by her in vain, wildly rejected her. “O Nature!” I exclaimedduring such moments, “what do you want from me?” Then again I believed tobe tenderly embracing her, imploring her, full of impatience, to fulfill my wishes.Fortunately, only trees were the witnesses of my outbursts in the solitude of thewoods, for I must really have resembled a madman. All other occupations becamehateful to me. To devote even a single moment to them seemed to me like acrime against truth. I regretted the time that I needed to give expression to mythoughts. I found that we are used to clothing each thought immediately, withoutlong reflection, in the language best known to us: and so I made the strangedecision to free myself from this slavery...For three months I thought withoutwords.When I ended this deep thinking, I looked around in amazement. My sensesno longer betrayed me as before. All things looked different to me . . . Graduallypeace returned to my soul, for now it was wholly convinced that the truth Ihad been pursuing so vehemently really existed. Admittedly I still perceived heronly from afar, still surrounded by a faint nebula, but I clearly saw the road thatled towards her...Now a long and difficult journey through the realm of otherpeople’s opinions lay ahead of me.66[Mesmer],Kurze Geschichte,42–47.Cf.Benz,Franz Anton Mesmer,23–24;Baier,Meditation undModerne,vol.i,183."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Magnetic historiography: German Romantic mesmerism261Although the author of this autobiographical fragment, Franz AntonMesmer, is known as a man of the Enlightenment, the description makeshim look rather like a Romantic visionary. His claim of “thinking with-out words” confirms the importance attached to “higher knowledge” evenamong representatives of the GermanAufkl ̈arung:7Mesmer is saying thathe struggled with Nature until she revealed her secrets to him through anecstatic state beyond rational discourse.8Mesmer’s theory of “animal magnetism” posited the existence of a uni-versal “fluid” or life-force intermediary between spirit and matter, permeat-ing the planetary atmosphere and all organic life, and moving harmoniouslyalong with the tides of gravitation. Illness had to do with blockages in thenatural flow of this fluid through the human body, but harmony could berestored by various techniques, such as the laying on of hands or making“passes” over the patient’s body. In Mesmer’s original approach, patientstypically went through a violent “crisis” as part of the healing process;but one of his followers, the marquis de Puys ́egur, developed a techniquethrough which the patient fell into a peculiar trance that became known asartificial somnambulism. The complicated further development of “mes-merism” and somnambulism has been documented extensively, and thereis no longer any doubt about its key importance for a whole series ofextremely influential, and closely interrelated, developments in nineteenth-and twentieth-century culture, including spiritualism and occultism, theAmerican New Thought movement and its many offshoots up to thepresent day, and – most relevant for the present discussion – the “discoveryof the unconscious” leading to modern psychology and psychiatry.9Tounderstand that connection, and its importance for the academic studyand historiography of Western esotericism, we must now take a closer lookat the somewhat neglected history of mesmerism in German Romanticculture.7Neugebauer-W ̈olk, “‘H ̈ohere Vernunft’ und ‘H ̈oheres Wissen’,”170–172.8Mesmer confirms this himself: in a footnote, he identifies such “thinking without words” as leadingto a form of “enthusiasm,” and warns the reader against its risks: the highest level of ecstasy is veryclose to madness, and the extreme mental exertion needed to achieve such a state may be dangerousto the brain (Kurze Geschichte,43n.10).9Succinct overview with bibliographies in M ́eheust, “Animal Magnetism/Mesmerism.” Comprehen-sive histories of mesmerism and its many ramifications are Ellenberger,Discovery of the Unconscious,53–253; Crabtree,From Mesmer to Freud; and Gauld,History of Hypnotism.

The most famous of all these somnambulic patientswas Friederike Hauffe, known as “the Seeress of Prevorst,” whose casewas described in detail by the poet and physician Justinus Kerner in abestselling book of1829;15but similar phenomena appear to have been10Baier,Meditation und Moderne,vol.i,190, with reference to Reil, “ ̈Uber die Eigenschaften”; andKluge,Versuch einer Darstellung,217–219,223–267. On the latter, see Gauld,History of Hypnotism,99–110. The connection between the ganglion system and magnetism/somnambulism was made byReil himself (“ ̈Uber die Eigenschaften,”231–235).11The terminology is Reil’s own, although he speaks of “bewusstlos” rather than “unbewusst” (see,for example, “ ̈Uber die Eigenschaften,”216,236,239).12On these authors and their use of the theory, see Baier,Meditation und Moderne,vol.i,179–246;Faivre, “‘Eloquence magique’”; Magee, “Hegel on the Paranormal”; Hanegraaff, “A Woman Alone”;Hanegraaff, “Versuch ̈uber Friederike Hauffe.”13Schubert,Ansichten.14Schubert,Symbolik des Traumes,1.15Kerner,Seherin von Prevorst.

In theparadigmatic formulations of Justinus Kerner, the shallow “daylight” worldof the rationalist, whose hard “glass skull (tabula vitrea)” keeps him isolatedfrom intuitions of a higher world, stands against the profoundly meaningful“nocturnal” world of the somnambules, who know from direct experiencethat behind the brutal realities of social and material existence there is amuch larger, all-encompassing, and deeply meaningful life. Hence thereare two complementary worlds, or levels of reality, each with its own spe-cific mode of experience and expression: while the Enlightenment reduceseverything to cold logic and discursive prose, its alternative expresses itselfthrough profound symbols and poetic language. When our bodily sensesshut down temporarily, and we descend into dream or somnambulic trance,our soul “wakes up” to the larger world whence it has come and where itreally belongs.17The rationalist, in contrast, is spiritually asleep. He lives ina state of artificial isolation from his own soul and its powers of perception,incapable of understanding the language of symbols and poetry. He naivelybelieves that his brain and his senses show him all there is, never realizingthat they are obstacles rather than reliable instruments for discovering thedeeper “secrets of nature.” Blind as he is to her spiritual dimensions, hecan only dismiss belief in occult powers and supra-normal abilities as irra-tional “superstition.” Such abilities are, however, neither miraculous norsupernatural: they arenaturalhuman faculties, potentially available to usall. Hence, the remarkable feats of somnambules reveal the powers that arelatent in humanity, and the first step towards developing them is to rejectthe limited and limiting reductionist superstitions that have claimed thename of science and reason for themselves.16For the wider context in Germany, with discussion of several case studies, see Sawicki,Leben mitden Toten,131–225. Among the many intellectuals who traveled to Weinsberg to visit FriederikeHauffe were (next to those mentioned in the text) such famous names as Franz von Baader, JosephG ̈orres, Friedrich Schelling, Friedrich Schleiermacher, and David Friedrich Strauss (for the latter’saccount, see Hanegraaff, “A Woman Alone,”246).

For Paracel-sus and Johannes Baptista van Helmont, this was the seat of thearchaeusor “life spirit,” and it assumed a crucial importance in German Romanticmesmerism as well. An earlier mesmerist, Tardy de Montravel, pointed totheHerzgrubeas the location of the “interior sense” through which directperception was possible independent of the five exterior senses;19and infact, this region was constantly highlighted as the main organ of clairvoy-ant perception in virtuoso somnambulists such as Friederike Hauffe. Inother words: against the cold rational knowledge of the brain associatedwith the cerebral system, the German Romantic mesmerists highlightedthe superior spiritual “knowledge of the heart” associated with its gan-glionic counterpart. This knowledge included “paranormal” or clairvoyantperception, but went far beyond it to embrace metaphysical realms. Fol-lowing the micro/macrocosmic correspondence thinking of paracelsian andswedenborgian theory, the heart as the center of the human organism cor-responded with the sun as the center of the solar system; and this center, inturn, corresponded with the unfathomable light of divinity at the heart of allcreation.20Ultimately, then, the somnambulic knowledge of the heart wasunderstood as a gnosis about divine things, infinitely superior to the merelyrational knowledge of the brain and the testimonies of the exterior senses.21By presenting “daylight” rationality as a limited instrument – powerlessto grasp the deeper “nightside” truths accessible to the soul, or explain18On the intellectual origins of RomanticNaturphilosophiein what I have called the “alchemical”paradigm, dominated by Paracelsianism and Boehmian theosophy, see, for example, Faivre andZimmermann,Epochen der Naturmystik; and Faivre,Philosophie de la nature.

Most importantfor our present concerns, however, are the historiographical implications:anything that Enlightenment historiography had sought to consign to thewaste-basket of history – magic, divination, clairvoyance, symbolism, theoccult – now came to be perceived as manifestations of the soul and itshidden powers, and highlighted ascentralto the historical development ofhuman culture! At the same time, however, because anything pertainingto the soul was believed to be of universal and eternal validity, historicityand temporality themselves were downplayed in favor of timeless truths,and mere “external events” in favor of their “inner essence.” One can seethis clearly, for example, in one of the earliest German Romantic authorswho attempted to sketch a history of “magnetism,” Johann Carl Passavant.Along Hegelian lines, he introduced that history as follows:Of the history of humanity we know almost nothing but the outer occurrence, thedead letter, the skeleton of times. The life-giving spirit that moved individuals andentire generations, and is expressed only as half-understandable ciphers in deedsand world-events, remains inaccessible to historical research. This is why the morewe investigate the wellsprings of human spiritual activity, out of dissatisfaction withmere external phenomena, and descend into the deeper recesses of our inner self,where spiritual treasures lie hidden, the more often do we find the books of the pastto be closed to us, the more hieroglyphic does their writing appear to us. For exam-ple, we hear of men who, through their profound insights into the essence of things,through their inspired speech, or through laudable deeds, were like bright starsto their contemporaries; but what is most important – the spiritual roots of thesephenomena, the light that illuminated those elect ones, the power that inspiredthem, the motivation for their great deeds – we can hardly guess. The mortal eyeperceives only the dial of time, not the clockwork that moves the hour hands.23In the second part of his monograph on magnetism and somnambulism,Passavant sketched its historical antecedents among the Israelites, Indians,22Jung,The Red Book, Liber Primus, vol.ii,cap.i.23Passavant,Untersuchungen ̈uber den Lebensmagnetismus,271–272.

In1809he took part in theTyrolean war of liberation against France and Bayern, and after somefurther peregrinations ended up in Berlin, where he continued his medicalstudies under Fichte, Reil (the inventor of the ganglionic theory), and othermajor authorities on mesmerism including Christoph Wilhelm Hufelandand Karl Christian Wolfart. After further military adventures – he wasrewarded for his courage with an iron cross – in1814he returned to Berlinto finish his studies in medicine. In the following years he worked on hislarge history of magnetism, published in1819,26and in the same year wasappointed professor in the medical faculty of the University of Bonn – thecenter of German RomanticNaturphilosophie.From1837on he workedas a physician, first in Innsbruck and from1841to his death in Munich,during which time he cultivated his contacts with thinkers like Kernerand Schubert. A completely reworked version of his history of magnetismappeared in1844under the new titleGeschichte der Magie, and it is on thiswork that I will further concentrate.27InChapter2, we saw that the earliest attempts at a historical concep-tualization of “Western esotericism” emerged from the anti-apologeticismof Jacob Thomasius, in the form of Colberg’s Protestant heresiologicalconstruct of “Platonic-Hermetic Christianity” and Brucker’s history of“philosophia sectaria.” From this perspective, the domain as a whole wasinterpreted as the continuation of pagan religion concealed as Christian-ity. Against these Protestant and Enlightenment approaches, the RomanCatholic and Romantic physician Ennemoser now presented a history24Ibid.,413.

Thequestion of platonic or pagan influences on Christianity played no struc-tural role in his story; but in line with the general shift of emphasis high-lighted inChapter3, science and natural philosophy had become thebasic framework. In sharp contrast with Enlightenment naturalism or pos-itivism, however, Ennemoser’s Romantic/mesmeristNaturphilosophiewasbased upon a concept of “living nature” (Faivre) permeated by invisible,occult, “mysterious and incalculable powers” (Weber). He emphasized thatthese powers were neither supernatural nor demonic in origin, as claimedby traditional Christianity, but no superstitious illusions either, as claimedby Enlightenment rationalism: rather, they should be seen as manifesta-tions of the “inner” and more profound nightside of nature, that revealsitself only when “daylight consciousness,” dominated by the rational brainand the exterior senses, is temporarily suppressed. It is important to realizehow easily such a thesis harmonized with the pietist sensibilities that hadbeen cultivated in German culture since the seventeenth century. Som-nambulic states were extremely similar to the “divine ecstasies” (g ̈ottlicheEntz ̈uckungen) that had been highlighted by Spener with reference to theapostle Paul, and criticized asSchw ̈armereior “enthusiasm” by opponents;and already Colberg had emphasized the tendency of the “enthusiasts” todistinguish each and every thing into “external” and “internal” (the InnerChurch, inner word, inner heaven, and so on).28Add to this the evidentdependence of Romantic mesmerism andNaturphilosophieon the Germantraditions of Paracelsianism and Christian theosophy, and it is clear that inEnnemoser’s history of magic, we have the “Hermetic-Platonic” answer toColberg and Brucker.Ennemoser’s understanding ofMagieorMagismuscomes straight outof the Renaissance tradition ofmagia naturalisunderstood as apriscamagia, obviously including its emphasis on the classic concept of'\u001d\r\t\u0005\u0004\u0005\f\u0007\u0002\u0003\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\r(which had already included magnetism in antiquity) or occultqualities in the wider context ofphilosophia occulta. He never gives a sharpdefinition of magic, but clearly presents it as the “ancient wisdom” assuch, referring to it as the “sum of all secret wisdom,” and adopting theconventional distinction between true divine magic and evil or supersti-tiousgoeteia(Zauberei,orsorcery).29The most significant innovation lies28SeeChapter2,page111.29Ennemoser,Geschichte der Magie,65–66(including the terminology of “white” versus “black”magic)."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"268The truth of historyin his emphasis – which announces the progressive psychologization ofmesmerism through the nineteenth century – that the true magic “liesin the most secret and innermost powers of the mind.”30Suggesting anotion of progress “from magic to science” while adapting it to his ownends, Ennemoser states that the genuinely scientific study of these pow-ers began only with Mesmer, and hence his history of magic proper isrestricted to the previous, pre-scientific stage.31His emphasis on the mindis evident in his general introduction “on magic and its parts in gen-eral,” which is dominated by three long chapters about visions, dreams,and prophecy/divination (das Wahrsagen) as the central manifestations of“magic”: although Ennemoser believes strongly in action at a distance andthe power of mind over matter, and distinguishes between “visionary”(schauende) and “active” (wirkende) magic,32he is ultimately most inter-ested in magic as a means of achieving “higher (or deeper) knowledge” ofthe world.Clearly representative of German historiographical approaches in thewake of Herder, Ennemoser thinks of history in terms of the achieve-ments of successive “peoples.” He divides it into three parts: the “ancientworld” (the Oriental peoples, the Egyptians, the Israelites), the world ofthe Greeks and Romans, and the “Germanic world” (from the ancient Ger-mans and Nordic peoples through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,continuing into the present). If one steps back to consider the course of“history as a whole,” in a visionaryGesamtschau,33its events appear to befar from random and can be described in terms of lawful organic develop-ment. History then reveals itself as a deeply meaningful drama in severalacts: it narrates the story of how, with many twists and turns, the inbornpotential of human consciousness slowly but certainly comes to full realiza-tion, according to God’s providential design.34Similar to Lessing’s famousErziehung des Menschengeschlechts, Ennemoser’s leading metaphor is that ofan individual’s life: humanity progresses from birth and childhood throughadolescence to full maturity. But he also keeps using the metaphor of atree that develops from its seeds and roots into a trunk that finally bearsbranches and flowers, and that of a stage drama: at given moments intime, a new people “steps on to the stage of history” to play the part thatProvidence has written for it.

Humanity still“hung on to nature by the umbilical cord and sat in the Creator’s lap”:37it lived in a barely conscious, dreamlike state of innocence, intimately onewith nature. “Magical” states of mind were more common than today, andbecause man’s inner sense, “yet undisturbed by reflection, was still moreopen to the voice of nature,” he lived his life in the peaceful harmonyof “the endless depth of an untroubled mind.”38The presence of divinitywas still experienced everywhere in nature, humanity stood under thebenevolent guidance of an ideal priesthood, and “God, the Seers, andthe Poets” spoke through a superior Ur-language of symbolic images.39Ennemoser has to admit that there was also “superstition and idolatry,”but hardly dwells on it: “Faith, love and obedience were everywhere thepillars.”40Because Ennemoser sees magic as a universal phenomenon rooted innatural human abilities, he does not trace it back to Persia but emphasizesits presence throughout the ancient Orient, including India and China.41His long discussions of magic among the oriental peoples focus on ecstaticvisionary states and healing arts practiced in temples by a spiritually enlight-ened priesthood. Ennemoser argues that the ancient forms of temple heal-ing were based upon a “natural science” whose basic principles were thesame as those of modern mesmerism.42The “secret doctrines” (Geheim-lehren) concerning such practices were preserved by priestly elites andtransmitted through mystery initiations and mythical narratives.

The people of Israel were destined to becomethe oriental “root” or “stem” from which humanity would grow throughadolescence to maturity:In the ancient, true sense of the word, Judaism is the real tree of life of the inner,genetically progressing development of culture. All the other pagan peoples withtheir various religious systems are twigs torn off from the great tree of life: althoughthey vegetate, they are capable of no inner development [Wachsthum]. Judaism isthe real Mysterium, which in Christianity attained the ideal state of sanctity andreunion with God [Gottesvereinigung].45The Jews, with their forward-looking mentality, developed a new kindof magic based upon a humble reliance on divine grace rather than thehubrisof human autonomy.46Since Ennemoser always emphasizes “inner”processes rather than external causality, it is easy for him to avoid a depen-dence of Judaism on pagan Egypt: although they spent so much time in thatcountry, the Jews adopted very little of its magical traditions.47The roleof kabbalah in Ennemoser’s narrative remains somewhat unclear: he dis-cusses it not in his chapter on “the Old Covenant” (which concentrates ondreams, visions, and trances in the Old Testament), but in the introductoryparts of his book,48and his understanding of the topic appears to be basedentirely on Franz Joseph Molitor’s famousPhilosophie der Geschichte oder ̈uber die Tradition(1827–1839), which is quoted extensively.49In line withthis source, Ennemoser hardly bothers to differentiate between Jewish andChristian manifestations: to explain what kabbalah is all about, he freelyrefers to such authorities as Reuchlin, Knorr von Rosenroth, Paracelsus,B ̈ohme, Pordage, Pasqually, Saint-Martin, Henry More, Schelling, and vonBaader.43Ibid.,222–226,364–366.44Ibid.,282,cf.264.45Ibid.,62.

Only the faithful observer and worshipper of Nature, who traces hersigns and listens to her voices, gets to know the hidden laws of Nature...whilethe rest of the world, as if half asleep, gets ever more alienated from the divine andsinks away in illusion and superstition. That is why all the great natural scientistshave always been truly pious people; that is why the magnetic clairvoyant, wakingup in sleep from the daylight dream, through his deeper insight into the secretworkings of Nature and her symbols breaks out in ecstatic admiration, in poeticutterings and songs of praise – just as in the poetic time of beginnings, whenknowledge about Nature, poetry, and religion were still one.54Flourishing in Alexandria, neoplatonic “eclecticism” was the essentialmedium through which all the magical traditions of the declining paganworld were transmitted to Christianity.55In evaluating this phenomenonpositively, as a crucial step in the continuation of ancient magical wisdom,50Ennemoser,Geschichte der Magie,461.51Ibid.,484: “Das ganze Griechenthum ist eine lebendige Magie . . . denn das Griechenthum istdurchaus poetischer Natur.”52Ibid.,616–703.

In the final part of his book, Ennemoser tracesthe history of true magic (Magie) – that is to say, the natural magic basedon magnetism – in what he sees as the “Germanic” period, but much of hisattention goes to its negative counterpart: the various forms of demonic oridolatrous superstition of the Middle Ages, culminating in the witchcraftcraze. In these discussions, his essentially scientific agenda becomes moreand more evident. It is clear to Ennemoser that belief in witchcraft was atragic mass delusion, and he does not want to spend much time on phenom-ena that may be associated with “magic” but cannot easily be interpretedin terms of magnetism, such as “spirit-conjurors and exorcists, treasure-diggers and alchemical goldmakers, astrological and hermetic mystagogueslike the Rosicrucians etc., horoscope-makers, Illuminati and cartomancers,necromancers, and mirror-prophets etc.”57He does devote some discus-sion to Christian theosophers known for their ecstatic or trance-like states,like John Pordage, Thomas Bromley, Antoinette Bourignon, Jane Leade,Pierre Poiret, and Emanuel Swedenborg, but his ambivalence is obvious:he admits that most of what they do pertains to magic in the good sense,but feels he has to warn against the risk of getting lost “in the fanaticaldarkness of spiritual adepts.”58Not surprisingly, the true lineage of post-medieval magic up to Mesmer begins with the physicians Paracelsus andthe elder van Helmont, continuing from there to authors like Agrippa,Fludd, Campanella, Kircher (important because of his work on the mag-net) plus a range of Paracelsians, and ending with Gassner, Cagliostro andSwedenborg in the eighteenth century.

The Graeco-Roman world was a fleeting phenomenon,like the contemporary moment, but an endless future still lies ahead for theGerman spirit. The history of the world so far has merely provided it with theelements for an endless spiritual activity. Therefore, if the Orient has often beencompared with childhood, the time of the Greeks and Romans with the livingmovement and vitality of the adolescent, and the Germanic one with maturemanhood, this comparison is true insofar as with German history, maturity isonly just beginning: Germanhood has a whole new future ahead of it, first tocomplete its own formation, and then to become a leader and teacher of thepeoples and the times . . . [T]he Greeks and Romans were just the momentarymeans of transmission between old and new; and the Orient, already sunk intostagnation and into the night of the past, is dreaming in a thousand-year sleep ofdeath, until one day, stirred up by the new Germanic spirit of the future, it willwake up to fresh new life again.61This must suffice as an overview of Ennemoser’s German Romantic vision.Its importance for the general argument of this book has to do with no fewerthan three innovative features: (1) his use ofmesmerism/somnambulismasthe heuristic “key” for tracing the history of magic, (2)hisevolutionist/providentialistvision, and (3)thereligionistnature of his approach ingeneral.The first point stands in stark contrast with previous historiographies of“Western esotericism,” which had concentrated essentially on philosophicalor religious ideas and opinions, and had been concerned with the historyof the true religious doctrine or the conflict between pagan or hereticalconcepts and biblical theology. None of that was of any importance toEnnemoser: his concern was, quite simply, to show that the phenomenaof magnetism and somnambulic trance were nothing new but had existedsince the earliest childhood of humanity. In making that claim, he becamethe chief pioneer of a new genre of “occult historiography.” Within tenyears, his book was published in an English translation,62and, by that61Ennemoser,Geschichte der Magie,264–265.62Ennemoser’s history was translated in1854by William Howitt, asHistoryofMagic,withanappendixdevoted to stories of “apparitions, dreams, second sight, somnambulism, predictions, divination,witchcraft, vampires, fairies, table-turning, and spirit-rapping” compiled by his wife Mary (on thisremarkable couple and their work, see Oppenheim,The Other World,36–38).

The relation between German Romantic mesmerism and Blavatsky, by mediation ofEnglish authors who had studied the sources in the original language, deserves further study: inThe"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"274The truth of historytime, the Scottish lawyer John Campbell Colquhoun – who had studied inGermany and was deeply familiar with the tradition ofNaturphilosophie–had already published his ownHistory of Magic, Witchcraft, and AnimalMagnetismin two volumes (1851).63Along very similar lines as Ennemoser,he traced the history of magnetism a.k.a. magic from the ChaldaeanMagito Mesmer, but without the heavy evolutionist/providentialist slant. In the“Waste Land” of the later nineteenth century, his book was one among thevery few that made it possible for readers to place the various manifestationsof “the occult” within a reasonably clear historical narrative from antiquityto the present.In the last decade of the century, we find essentially the same approachin a series of large and erudite works on the history of “occultism” and the“occult sciences” published by an elusive private scholar, Carl Kiesewetter(1854–1895).64Similar to A. E. Waite in the anglophone world, Kiesewet-ter’s impressive erudition made him into the virtually unavoidable Germanauthority for history of “the occult.” In the Introduction to his first largevolume,Geschichte des neueren Occultismus(1891), he defined “occultism”as concerned with “all those phenomena of nature and the soul [des Natur-und Seelenlebens] that have not yet been generally recognized by officialscience [and] whose causes are hidden from the senses.”65In other words:writing the history of “occultism” meant tracing how earlier generationshad practiced and theorized about the “psychic” or “paranormal” phenom-ena that were currently the object of parapsychology or psychical research.Thus, for example, Kiesewetter’s first chapter focused on Agrippa’s ideasabout such topics as telepathy, dreams, clairvoyance, hypnosis, ecstasy,Theosophical Enlightenment, Joscelyn Godwin has highlighted Blavatsky’s debt to Enlightenmentmythography, but to understand her evolutionism and her pervasive references to the mesmericfluid, sources such as Wilkins’ Ennemoser translation or the works of John Campbell Colquhoun(see text) may be equally important. In1836, the latter had even published a study of animalmagnetism under the titleIsis Revelata!63On Colquhoun, see also Baier,Meditation und Moderne,vol.i,212,245,258,282.64Almost nothing is known about Kiesewetter’s life and career. He lived with his mother in a smalltown, Meiningen, and was a regular contributor to the important occultist journalDie Sphinx.Max Dessoir remembered him as a large bald man with a red face, who was “anything but anascetic or navel-gazer” but, rather, “was living quite a wild life” and had no patience for piousupper-class ladies swooning over the occult: “Remarkable about Kiesewetter is that he was faithfullike a child when it came to ancient manuscripts, but a stubborn and mocking skeptic about reportsfrom his own time” (Buch der Erinnerung,129–130). Emil Bock claims that Kiesewetter “ate anddrank himself to death” (Rudolf Steiner,173–174), but according to a persistent rumor that I havebeen unable to confirm or disconfirm, his premature death at age forty-one was caused by a failedexperiment with the witches’ salve.65Kiesewetter,Geschichte des neueren Okkultismus,13. The formulation echoes the third objective ofthe Theosophical Society, of which Kiesewetter was a member: “To investigate unexplained laws ofNature and the powers latent in man.”"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Magnetic historiography: German Romantic mesmerism275the magical power of the will, and the mesmeric or magnetic life force;and he went on to trace these themes through essentially the same seriesof sixteenth- to eighteenth-century authors that had been discussed byEnnemoser. But he also discussed Ennemoser himself, and continued withnineteenth-century spiritualism and psychical research up to and includ-ing Carl du Prel. After three smaller books on the Faust figure, John Dee,and Mesmer himself (all published in1893), Kiesewetter began to push hisinvestigations ever farther back into the past, resulting in a large volumeon the history of alchemy, astrology, and magic (Die Geheimwissenschaften,1895) and another one on the occult in antiquity (Der Occultismus desAltertums, vol.i,1896). Kiesewetter’s books became standard references inthe field, at least in the German-speaking world, and deserve more studyin their own right, but for our present concerns we can dispense with adetailed analysis. It suffices that, similar to A. E. Waite’s volumes, theyare essentially works of erudition that give the reader access to otherwiseobscure materials, often by means of lengthy quotations; and that, likeEnnemoser’s and Colquhoun’s, their intention is to provide contempo-rary research into the “paranormal” with a solid historical pedigree. Fromsuch a perspective, “Western esotericism” was no longer understood interms of a syncretism between pagan/platonic ideas and biblical Chris-tianity, but as comprising the sum of historical evidence for the mysteri-ous powers of nature and the human mind prematurely discarded by theEnlightenment.Moving on to the second innovative feature of Ennemoser’sGeschichteder Magie: as far as the history of “Western esotericism” is concerned, itwas the exemplary and pioneering example of a new type of historiographytypical of the Romantic period. It was neither a narrative of decline or con-tinuity of the “ancient wisdom” (as in theprisca theologiaandphilosophiaperennistradition); nor was it an exercise in intellectual history, based onthe assumption that to understand the ideas of specific authors or currents,one must put them in their historical context and investigate the influencesupon them (as in the histories of Colberg and Brucker). Contrary to theformer approach, Ennemoser presented his readers with a teleological nar-rative of spiritual progress by means of evolution, which endowed the veryfact of historical change and development with profound spiritual meaningand import; and contrary to the latter, he rejected “external” causation infavor of the “inner” drives and dynamics of divine providence, or God’splan with humanity. As far as academic research is concerned, historiogra-phies of this type would only very gradually lose their credibility along withthe general decline of Romanticism and German idealism during and after"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"276The truth of historythe nineteenth century. They were, however, adopted with great enthusi-asm by occultist authors, and have remained popular in esoteric and NewAge circles to the present day.66For the third innovative feature of Ennemoser’s work, it is useful tolook back at the discussion of Gottfried Arnold’s history of Christianity inChapter2. As we have seen, it was grounded in a radical pietist rejectionof sterile dogmatic dispute in favor of direct spiritual experience. Follow-ing exactly the same logic, Ennemoser attacked the “cerebral thinking” ofthe self-appointed “schoolmasters” and “policemen” of reason,67with theirendless quarreling over mere words and abstractions. Both authors agreedthat what mattered in history was not the dead letter but the living spirit,not outward doctrines but inward experience, not the knowledge of thebrain but the knowledge of the heart. This similarity is not accidental, butreflects a structural commonality grounded in German pietist sensibilities.Arnold’s historiography was based upon the concept of a radical incom-mensurability between “Athens” (reason) and “Jerusalem” (faith), whichsimply do not speak the same language and share no common ground;and the same logic of incommensurability governs Ennemoser’s contrastbetween the discursive “daytime” consciousness of the brain and the expe-riential “nightside” consciousness of the soul. Arnold argued that faith hadnothing in common with reason; and similarly, Ennemoser saw no pointin using the language of the brain to speak about the truths of the soul.Both authors would have readily agreed that when it comes to spiritualrealities, critical debate is useless: there is simply no alternative to directspiritual experience.As a result, neither of our two authors was able (or willing) to lookat historical developments from the perspective of social context, externalinfluences on the genesis or development of ideas, or contingent factors:all those were clearly irrelevant or, at best, of secondary importance. Butnevertheless, both claimed to be writing history. Above, I referred to thispeculiar combination as typical of “religionism,” and it should now be clear66On the importance of Romantic evolutionism to nineteenth-century esotericism, see Hanegraaff,New Age Religion,462–482,andcf.302–330for the point that even New Age visions of historicalevolution still tend to focus on a “Platonic Orientalist” lineage through Egypt and the Essenes toChristianity: “the Christian west is consistently highlighted as the center stage for those historicalevents which have been essential to humanity’s spiritual evolution” (ibid.,303).

A particularly clear example of latter-dayRomantic (neo-Hegelian) evolutionism is Ken Wilber’s transpersonal historiography inUp FromEden(1983).67For invectives against such thinking, see, for example, Ennemoser,Geschichte der Magie,vii–x,36,63,265,271."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"The archetype of Eranos277that Ennemoser’s work represents an important new development in thehistory of that phenomenon after Arnold.

Originallyinfluenced by modern theosophy and other forms of contemporaryesotericism,68these gatherings quickly evolved towards an academic format,and became known as the Eranos meetings from1933on.69The lectureswere published in an annual book series, the Eranos Year Books, editedby Fr ̈obe-Kapteyn until her death in1962, when the organization and edi-torship passed to Rudolf Ritsema and Adolf Portmann. Eranos meetingsare still being organized today, by several competing organizations, but theoriginal series came to an end in1988, when Ritsema decided to abandon68For the influences on Fr ̈obe-Kapteyn, see Hakl,Verborgene Geist,33–79. Her lifelong fascinationwith myth, symbolism, and the mystery religions of antiquity seems to have been kindled by herfriendship with the Christian esthete and mystagogue Ludwig Derleth, who introduced her to theRomantic mythographers Friedrich Creuzer and Johann Jacob Bachofen (Helbing, “Ludwig undAnna Maria Derleth,”70; and extensive discussion in Hakl,Verborgene Geist,38–51). She was alsointerested in Vedanta, and had contact with the Ramakrishna movement and the TheosophicalSociety, but disliked the bohemian lifestyle of nearby Monte Verit`a. Fr ̈obe-Kapteyn’s first summerconferences were dominated by the theosophist Alice Bailey, who left in1933when “the placewas overrun by German professors and the whole tone and quality of the place altered” (Bailey,Unfinished Autobiography,225).69By far the best-informed history of Eranos was published in German by Hans Thomas Hakl in2001(Verborgene Geist von Eranos), and I am grateful to Dr. Hakl for granting me access to theexpanded and updated English translation, due for publication in the near future. Hakl describes agradual development from the early “esoteric” meetings, with a prominent presence of Alice Bailey,towards the eventual academic format, and calls attention to the importance of Graf HermannKeyserling’sSchule der Weisheitin Darmstadt as a model for Eranos (Verborgene Geist,33–99,101). An indispensable source alongside Hakl’s work is McGuire,Bollingen. A very useful studyfocused on Jung, Eliade, and Campbell is Ellwood,Politics of Myth.

The first period might wellbe called the “Jung Era”: without any doubt, the Swiss psychologist was thedominant figure, next to a range of other important thinkers including theindologist Heinrich Zimmer, the theologian Friedrich Heiler, the histo-rian of religion Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, the philosopher Martin Buber, theIslamicist Louis Massignon, and scholars of mythology such as Walter F.Otto and Karl Ker ́enyi. As a new development, the second, postwar periodbegan by a broadening of scope, with the invitation of natural scientistssuch as the biologist Adolf Portmann and the physicist Erwin Schr ̈odinger;but the heyday came in the1950sand1960s, when Eranos attracted a trulyremarkable series of scholars of religion from all over the world, many ofwhom became celebrities. Among the most famous names are the pioneerof Jewish kabbalah Gershom Scholem, the Islamicist Henry Corbin, andthe scholar of religion Mircea Eliade, next to the Japanese zen BuddhistD. T. Suzuki, the historian of gnosticism Gilles Quispel, the second-generation Jungian Erich Neumann, the phenomenologist of religion Ger-ardus van der Leeuw, the historian of religion Raffaele Pettazzoni, the his-torian of Christianity Ernst Benz, the theologian Paul Tillich, the scholarof symbolic anthropology Gilbert Durand, the psychologist James Hill-man, and, last but not least, the pioneering scholar of Western esotericismAntoine Faivre.Formulated in the most general terms, a willingness to takemyth andsymbolismseriously and explore their relevance to history and modern cul-ture is what the Eranos meetings were all about. However, against thebackground of my conclusions at the end of the previous chapter, thesebasic concepts should not be considered in isolation or understood accord-ing to narrow scholarly definitions. In practice, they were understood asintimately connected with a whole range of other terms that shared onething in common: the fact that they had ended up in the “waste-basket”category of exclusion against which the Enlightenment had been definingits own identity as rational and scientific. In the wake of this process ofidentity-formation by means of binary simplification, it had become prac-tically impossible to speak about “myth” or “symbolism” without touchingupon, or at least suggesting, things associated with “mysticism,” “esoteri-cism,” “magic,” or “the occult” as well. This post-Enlightenment tendencyof conflating all terms and categories that were seen as contrary to “sci-ence and rationality” into one diffuse counter-category had a paradoxical70For all the details about this change of direction and later developments, see Hakl,Verborgene Geist,359–373."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"The archetype of Eranos279result: it made the domain very hard to pin down because no single termseemed to cover the whole, but it nevertheless produced a clear sense ofcoherence and direction as well. Eranos, in other words, was concernedwith an area of research that might be difficult or even impossible to definein positive terms, but was easily recognized by itsalteritywith respect toEnlightenment rationality and modern science.71The core speakers of Eranos appear to have been animated by feelings ofurgency and grave intellectual responsibility, occasionally leading even toa sense of messianic vocation to resolve “the crisis of the modern world.”But what was the nature of that crisis, and what was the danger? Basic tothe characteristic Eranos perspective, I suggest, was a conviction that therepresentatives of Enlightenment and positivism had committed a seriouserror of judgment in assuming that just by dumping “myth,” “magic,” or“the irrational” into the waste-basket of history, one could make them goaway. In1871, in the midst of the positivist era, Edward Burnett Tylor hadstill been supremely confident in that regard: “the growth of myth has beenchecked by science, it is dying of weights and measures, of proportions andspecimens – it is not only dying, but half dead, and students are anatomisingit.”72Just a few decades later, however, James Frazer had expressed a verydifferent sentiment:It is beneath our feet – and not very far beneath them – here in Europe at thepresent day...This universal faith, this truly Catholic creed, is a belief in theefficacy of magic . . . [T]he permanent existence of such a solid layer of savagerybeneath the surface of society, and unaffected by the superficial changes of religionand culture [is] a standing menace to civilization. We seem to move on a thin crustwhich may at any moment be rent by the subterranean forces slumbering below.73Less than fifteen years later, the abyss had opened, and naive confidencein rationality, civilization, and progress was being ground to pieces in thetrenches of the World War. These traumatic events, and their worrying71This, I suggest, is why the two main scholars of Eranos both seem to agree about its “esoteric”nature although their understandings of that term are completely different.

Tylor had been mistaken, and Frazer’s fears had been provencorrect. If this was true, then what role should be accorded to “myth,” “sym-bolism,” and the non-rational (always understood in an inclusive sense) inmodern culture and society?At bottom, this is the question that animated the Eranos meetings andaccounts for their remarkable coherence over more than half a century. Theanswers varied greatly, ranging from an emphasis on the need for achievingsome kind of “integration” between the unconscious and conscious layersof the individual and collective psyche (as in Jung) to radical declarationsof war against the modern world (as in Corbin). An enormous amount ofcritical – and less than critical – literature has been devoted to the centralfigures of Eranos, and they have been the center of scholarly controversiesof a particularly emotional kind.79In the present section and the next,I will have to limit my discussion strictly to the question of how Eranosshould be situatedvis-`a-vis“Western esotericism,” and to the influence ofits specific perspective on how that field came to be conceptualized andunderstood after World War II.Carl Gustav Jung dominated the Eranos approach during the first phaseof its existence, but to understand the nature of his contribution, we mustbegin by recognizing the problem of the “Jung legend.”80Generations ofJungians have cultivated an idealized, even sanctified image of the Swisspsychologist, paradoxically combining an emphasis on his claim to beinga strict empirical scientist with the mysterious and romantic image of Jungas a kind of modern shaman or initiate into numinous mysteries. Thelatter dimension was based essentially on the famous volumeMemories,Dreams, Reflections(1962), which was marketed as Jung’s autobiographybut is in fact a heavily manipulated product of his secretary, Aniela Jaff ́e.8179As regards Jung, see, for example, the attacks by Jungians, Jung scholars, and historians of alchemyon Richard Noll,The Jung Cult(for example, Shamdasani,Cult Fictions; Segal, review of Noll;Tilton,Quest for the Phoenix,18–21). As regards Eliade, a particularly strong example is DanielDubuisson’s vendetta inTwentieth Century Mythologies,173–288,andImpostures et pseudo-science.For controversy over Corbin, see Wasserstrom,Religion after Religion, and responses such as Lory,“Note sur l’ouvrageReligion after Religion,” and Subtelny, “History and Religion.”80In spite of their differences, this point is emphasized by Richard Noll (Jung Cult,6,13–15)aswellas Sonu Shamdasani (Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology,1–3).81For the amazing details, see Shamdasani, “Memories, Dreams, Omissions”;Jung Stripped Bare,22–38.

Even today, Jungis usually seen primarily from the perspective of his relation to Freud, andthe dominant “Freud legend” has pictured him as the renegade studentwho abandoned psychoanalysis for a speculative worldview more akin tomysticism than to science. In fact, however, Jung was indebted at leastas much, and arguably more, to the tradition of William James, FredericMyers, and his Swiss compatriot Th ́eodore Flournoy.83The neglect of thislineage in favor of a Freudocentric one has resulted, as Sonu Shamdasaniputs it, in “nothing less than the complete mislocation of Jung and complexpsychology in the intellectual history of the twentieth century.”84Add tothis the more sensationalist perceptions of Jung as av ̈olkischracist andantisemite,85a thinly disguised occultist,86or the guru of a modern cult,8782Shamdasani,Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology,13–18.83Shamdasani,Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology,11–13; “Misunderstanding Jung,”460–462(also with reference to the researches of Eugene Taylor); Noll,Jung Cult,31–32; and for a generalintroduction to Flournoy and “subliminal psychology,” see Shamdasani, “Encountering H ́el`ene.”The only section inMemories, Dreams, Reflectionsnamed after an individual is that on Freud, but inthe original editorial typescript it was followed by a section on Flournoy and James. In the Germanedition these authors were still present in appendices, but these were deleted from the English andAmerican edition, thus leaving only Freud (Shamdasani, “Memories, Dreams, Omissions,”121).84Shamdasani,Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology,13; cf.

If “occultism” is seen as includingspiritualism and psychical research (for example Treitel,Science for the Soul), then it was certainlya strong influence on Jung. If understood as a historical current that tried to demarcate itselffromspiritualism (for example Pasi, “Occultism,”1367), then Jung has very little to do with it. In anearlier discussion of Jung, I interpreted his perspective as a Romantic as opposed to an occultist formof esotericism, with reference to a novel definition of occultism introduced by myself (Hanegraaff,New Age Religion,422–423,500–501).87This was the central thesis of Noll,Jung Cult.

G. Jung has almostbecome completely fictional.”88In his acclaimedDiscovery of the Unconscious(1970), Henri F. Ellen-berger created the foundations for a more adequate historical contextu-alization of the Swiss psychologist and his work. He showed that Jungmust be seen as a “late offshoot of Romanticism” who “returns to theunaltered sources of psychiatric romanticism and philosophy of nature.”89Even more specifically, Jung was a direct twentieth-century descendant ofthe German Romantic form of mesmerism discussed in the previous sec-tion, including its further roots in Paracelsianism and Christian theosophy.For anybody who can recognize the references, and takes the trouble ofgoing back to the German original, this is immediately evident from theopening chapter of the pivotal work that marked the beginning of hismature oeuvre,Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido(1912).90Titled “Onthe Two Ways of Thinking,” it is based entirely upon the distinction of“daytime” and “nightside“ consciousness pioneered by Schubert, Kerner,and his contemporaries. Significantly, the second type is not described assomething differentfrom, but as a different kindofthinking. Jung writesthat the dreamlike and associative type was more prominent in antiquity,and resulted in mythology instead of science.91The same type of think-ing is known to all of us from childhood, and is equally typical of the“lower races, like the negroes.”92From here, Jung proceeds to draw thefamous parallel between ontogenesis and phylogenesis – the psychologicaldevelopment from earliest childhood to maturity is a “repetition” of thedevelopment of human consciousness as a whole, from archaic to logi-cal thinking – concluding that our dreams are therefore an avenue towardsbetter understanding of our remote cultural past.93Jung’s use of this theoryfollowers may have exhibited “cult-like” characteristics. Unfortunately, Noll’s historical scholarshipis simply discarded along with the “cult”-thesis by his critic Shamdasani, who refuses to evenacknowledge his existence in his importantJung and the Making of Modern Psychology, and summarilydismisses his historical contributions, without arguments, inCult Fictions,7–8and n.20.88Shamdasani, “Misunderstanding Jung,”459; and cf.

The idea that myth is a reflection ofthe archaic “childhood of the human race” was a commonplace, and itwas easy for Jung to adopt Herbert Silberer’s conclusion that “Myth is thedream of the people – the dream is the myth of the individual.”95Hence the basic logic underlying Jung’sWandlungenis essentially quitesimple. If the interpretation of dreams is the key to psychological healingon the level of the individual, then the interpretation of myths is the keyto such healing on the level of the collective. If a healthy developmentimplies that unconscious material be taken seriously and integrated, thenit is vitally important for the peoples of modern Europe to take the contentsof their own phylogenetic unconscious seriously, so as to integrate ratherthan repress them. Both on the individual and on the collective levels, fail-ure to do so results in pathology.96One sees how naturally the concepts ofarchetypes and the collective unconscious result from this logic: the imagesand narratives that we remember as dreams must be based on the samestructural patterns as the symbols and myths that are remembered by thehuman race as a whole. The general assumption underlying this entire par-allelism is a Romantic evolutionism extremely similar to Ennemoser’s.97In both cases, human consciousness is seen as evolving through historyfrom the “lower races” and cultures to the higher ones, and contemporaryEuropean/Germanic culture is believed to be its most advanced manifes-tation so far. However – and it is here that Jung introduces an importantelement of innovation – this does not mean that it is necessarily health-ier. On the contrary: the growth towards maturity means that rational“daytime consciousness” emancipates itself from the dreamlike state ofchildhood, but this carries the risk of suppressing the latter rather thanintegrating it harmoniously. The result will be a misbalanced, neuroticculture continually threatened by destructive eruptions of libidinal energy.94Noll,Jung Cult,51–54; Shamdasani,Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology,184;Pietik ̈ainen,C.

He also knew that the phenom-ena of modern spiritualism had evolved straight out of the same mesmerictradition, used similar techniques, led to similar trance states, and resultedin similar “paranormal” phenomena and spirit visions. Hence he was boundto consider it bizarre that Freud expected him to set up the sexual theoryas a “bulwark” against the “black tide of mud” of occultism: “what Freudseemed to mean by ‘occultism’,” he objected, “was virtually everythingthat philosophy and religion, including the rising contemporary science ofparapsychology, had learned about the psyche.”100Jung’s insistence on “theoccult” therefore cannot be dismissed as of secondary importance, or asjust the superficial effect of contemporary fashions: on the contrary, it wascentral to how he conceived of psychology. As convincingly argued by SonuShamdasani, Jung’s ambition was not just to create a particular school ofpsychotherapy, but to establish psychologyin general, as the fundamentalscientific discipline upon which all other disciplines should henceforth be98Jung,Memories, Dreams, Reflections,120: “Kant’sDreams of a Spirit-Seercame just at the rightmoment, and soon I also discovered Karl Duprel . . .

For background, see Shamdasani, “EncounteringH ́el`ene.” Jung’s dissertation of1902(Zur Psychologie und Pathologie) was, of course, based entirelyon the same perspective. It described the case of a medium, Jung’s cousin H ́el`ene Preiswerk, who infact seems to have copied the behavior and phenomena of Friederike Hauffe from Justinus Kerner’sSeherin von Prevorst, which Jung had given her to read (Gruber, “Romantische Psychoanalyse?,”350)."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"286The truth of historybased.101The conceptual foundation for this universal and encyclopedicproject, I suggest, was the German Romantic mesmerist view of the souland its mysterious powers that has been neglected almost completely byJung specialists to the present day.Among other things, this background may help resolve the seeming para-dox that the man who appears as a kind of initiate into numinous mysteriesinMemories, Dreams, ReflectionsandThe Red Book, never ceased to insistthat he was a strictly empirical scholar. The German Romantic mesmeristsinsisted that they were exploring facts of consciousness (Thatsachen)thatbelongedtothenaturalorder and had nothing to do with “miracles” orthe supernatural.102If anybody was guilty of neglecting empiricism, theyargued, it was the Enlightenment ideologue, who denied the phenomenaof mesmerism and somnambulismapriori, dismissing them out of hand assuperstitious or supernatural illusions instead of taking the trouble to studythem first. Jung took the same approach: like William James, he subscribedto a radical empiricism that “concedes no a priori or preconceived limitsto what constitutes a ‘fact’,” and therefore saw psychology as concernedwith “the entire field of consciousness including its margins or fringes.”103Hence, even his most sensational visionary experiences, or encounters withspiritual guides like Philemon, were understood by him within an empiri-cal framework: like the German Romantic mesmerists (but unlike moderntheosophists, whom he disliked), he did not see them as attempts to contactsupernatural beings or metaphysical realities pertaining to the afterlife, butas demonstrations that the realm of Nature itself included a mysteriousNachtseite, now conceptualized as the unconscious, that had been arbitrar-ily ignored in the wake of the Enlightenment but belonged to the properdomain of scientific investigation.Returning now to our specific concerns in this chapter: what were theimplications of Jung’s vision for the Eranos approach to the study of reli-gion, and more specifically for the historical study of what we now callWestern esotericism? As already noted, with reference to Shamdasani, Jungbelieved that psychology should become the foundation of all other disci-plines, including history: its role should be “to counter the fragmentationof the sciences, and to provide a basis for a synthesis of all knowledge.”104101Shamdasani,Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology,15,18–22.102Hanegraaff, “A Woman Alone,”216; “Versuch,”23–24, with reference to Schubert,Ansichten,2;Kerner,Seherin von Prevorst,40,73,174,284;Kerner,Geschichte Besessener,128–129;vonMeyer,“Die Schutzgeister,”160; and Anon.

Psychologists like Jung himself could provide reli-able data from the clinical perspective, but scholars in all domains of thehumanities were needed to administer data about the development of con-sciousness in all cultures across the globe, from remote antiquity to thepresent.Now, if one looks at Jung’s approach to exploring the historical recordfrom that perspective, it appears to be remarkably similar, once again, towhat we find in Ennemoser’sHistory of Magic. For the Tyrolean physician,the revolutionary new science was mesmerism; for his Swiss colleague,it was a further development of mesmerism, now known as psychology.What the German Romantics had described as the “nightside of nature” hadbecome “the unconscious” for Jung. Both were concerned with studyingthe basic “facts of consciousness” empirically, in contemporary patients,andhistorically, by exploring the records of the past for evidence of thesame types of phenomena and experiences. In both cases, the result wasthat everything that had been consigned to the waste-basket of historyby the Enlightenment returned to center stage; but Ennemoser and Jungboth argued that this domain should be understood in a new way, as amanifestation of the soul and its hidden powers, and should thereforebe recognized ascentralto the historical development of human culture.Ennemoser spoke of a “history of magic,” from the primitive childhood ofhumanity through the ancient mystery cults, and from Renaissance authorslike Agrippa, Paracelsus, Campanella, B ̈ohme, van Helmont, Kircher, andFludd up to the new GermanNaturphilosophieassociated with authorslike von Baader or Schelling. Jung, for his part, provided a very similarpedigree for his own psychology, including the same collection of currentsand central personalities, with a similar emphasis on antiquity.There are, however, at least two important differences between Jung andhis German Romantic predecessors. First, Ennemoser’s story was typicalof his time in that it was grafted upon a traditional concept of Chris-tian salvation: he was thinking in terms of a providentialistHeilsgeschichtefocused on Judaism as the central tradition of human evolution, culminat-ing in the appearance of Christ as the pivotal event of history. Jung’s story,in contrast, was based upon the concept of an inherent tension betweenthe deeper “pagan” strata of consciousness derived from the earliest pre-Christian periods, and the later sediments added on to it by the emergenceof Judaeo-Christian thought: to a very large extent, in other words, thepsychological predicament of modern man could be understood as the"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"288The truth of historystruggle of his Christian consciousness with his pagan unconscious.105Thisidea of associating the “nightside of nature” with paganism, and “day-time consciousness” with Christianity, had not occurred to the GermanRomantic mesmerists. By making such a link, perhaps under the influenceof Nietzsche,106Jung reintroduced the basic theme of a struggle between“paganism” and biblical Christianity that has occupied us through the firsttwo chapters of this book.Second, Ennemoser’s story had left a large historical gap between an-tiquity and the Renaissance: from his account, the medieval period appearsas a “dark age” largely dominated by “goetic”Zauberei, such as witchcraft,but more or less devoid of healthier phenomena reminiscent of mesmerismor somnambulism. Jung, however, wanted an unbroken historical conti-nuity from antiquity to his own time, and created one by postulating alineage from gnosticism and neoplatonism through alchemy up to modernpsychology:As far as I could see, the tradition that might have connected Gnosis with thepresent seemed to have been severed, and for a long time it proved impossible tofind any bridge that led from gnosticism – or neo-platonism – to the contemporaryworld. But when I began to understand alchemy, I realized that it represented thehistorical link with gnosticism, and that a continuity therefore existed betweenpast and present. Grounded in the natural philosophy of the Middle Ages, alchemyformed the bridge on the one hand into the past, to gnosticism, and on the otherinto the future, to the modern psychology of the unconscious . . .107Jung came to understand gnosticism in terms of his theory of individuation:the goal of the gnostic was that of “finding his true self,” symbolized bythe image of an “interior sun” or star.108It is significant that this imageryhas in fact no parallel in the ancient gnostic sources,109butistypicalof105Obviously this logic would not hold for Jews. Hence, in his notorious essay “ ̈Uber das Un-bewusste” (1918), Jung stated that “Christianity split the Germanic barbarian into its upper anda lower half, and enabled him, by repressing the dark side, to domesticate the brighter halfand fit it for civilization,” but this split-consciousness problem did not exist for Jews. Jews weretherefore “domesticated to a higher degree,” whereas the barbarian unconscious was still present “indangerous concentrations in Germanic man” (ibid.,470–471; see discussion in Ellwood,Politics ofMyth,57–67; Noll,Jung Cult,97–103).106For Nietzsche’s influence on Jung, see Bishop,Dionysian Self. Jung was struck by the similaritybetween a passage from Nietzsche’sAlso sprach Zarathustraand a report from1686reprinted inKerner’sBl ̈atter aus Prevorst. He went as far as contacting Nietzsche’s sister, who confirmed thatNietzsche knew Kerner’s work and had read it together with her when she was eleven years old(Bishop,Dionysian Self,83–84).107Jung,Memories, Dreams, Reflections,227;cf.Pietik ̈ainen,C. G. Jung and the Psychology of SymbolicForms,130–144.108Hanegraaff,New Age Religion,501–508. As rightly emphasized by Noll, the influence of G. R. S.Mead on Jung’s understanding of gnosticism is an important research desideratum (Jung Cult,69).109Quispel, “Hesse, Jung und die Gnosis,”257."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"The archetype of Eranos289German Romantic mesmerism and its references to theHerzgrubeas theseat of the paracelsianarchaeus, corresponding with the sun as the “heart”of the universe according to Swedenborg’s system.110The whole point wasthat the “two ways of thinking” distinguished in Jung’sWandlungencouldbe seen as corresponding to two kinds of knowledge: a rational or cerebraltype expressed by discursive language, and a non-rational type (gnosis)consisting of direct intuition and perception “with the heart,” expressed bymeans of symbols.Hence, gnosticism related to official Christianity as the unconsciousrelated to consciousness: with its rich mythology and symbolic language,it represented the suppressed “nightside” counterpart of the religion thathad carried the day. After antiquity, the gnostic quest for self-knowledgeby individuation was continued, according to Jung, by the alchemical tra-dition; and it is here that we encounter the notorious problem of “spiritualalchemy.” The idea that alchemy is essentially a spiritual pursuit, not ascientific one, had first been proposed by Mary Atwood in1850,fromaperspective permeated by German Romantic mesmerism and Boehmiantheosophy.111A similar thesis was presented by Ethan Allen Hitchcock just afew years later, and it was also adopted by Traditionalists like Ren ́eGu ́enonand Julius Evola in the early twentieth century.112Reacting to the enormouspopularity of such interpretations in post-war Jungian milieus and alchem-ical scholarship, Principe and Newman have sharply criticized Jung foreffectively writing laboratory alchemy out of the picture and claiming that“alchemy’s real concern was the transformation of the psyche.”113We m u s t ,however, be careful with this interpretation. There is no doubt that in hisstudies of alchemical symbolism, “Jung’sreal concern was the transforma-tion of the psyche,” but it is important not to confuse the two statements.The former amounts to a massive, and manifestly untenable, claim aboutalchemy as a historical phenomenon.

Thus, Principe and Newman quote from theEnglish translation by Stanley Dell, published in1940, of an article origi-nally published in the Eranos Yearbooks: “we are called upon to deal, notwith chemical experimentations as such, but with something resemblingpsychic processes expressed in pseudo-chemical language.”115This mightlook like the proverbial “smoking gun” that proves Jung’s adherence to“spiritual alchemy,” but Tilton dismisses it as a misrepresentation of theoriginal. He refers the reader to the parallel passage in Jung’s chapter on the“psychic” nature of alchemy, in his bookPsychologie und Alchemie(orig.1944), which actually reads as follows: “In the alchemical work, we aredealingfor the greatest part not onlywith chemical experiments, butalsowith something resembling psychic processes expressed in pseudo-chemicallanguage” [italics added].116Unfortunately, however, neither Tilton norPrincipe/Newman seem to have looked at the original Eranos lecture,which undermines both their positions. It begins with a statement that isremarkablynegativeabout the purely “spiritual” understanding of alchem-ical symbolism in the wake of Jacob B ̈ohme:114Tilton points out that the “projection” of psychical contents onto the matter in the alembic wasunderstood by Jung not as a conscious process, as assumed by Principe and Newman, but asan unconscious one. The alchemists were therefore not seen as engaging in strange practices ofpsychic projection, but were “largelyunaware of the course of their psychic life during laboratorypractice,” and not at all “indifferent to the chemical nature of the substances in their retort”(Quest for the Phoenix,12–13;cf.Pietik ̈ainen,C. G. Jung and the Psychology of Symbolic Forms,140–141).115Jung, “Idea of Redemption in Alchemy,”210; quoted in Principe and Newman, “Some Problems,”402. Note that although Dell’s version is presented as a translation of Jung’s Eranos lecture, itcompletely changes the structure by reshuffling the various parts of the text. Whether Dell mighthave worked from a revised manuscript by Jung is unknown to me.116“Im alchemischen Opus handelt es sich zum gr ̈oßten Teil nicht nur um chemische Experimenteallein, sondern auch um etwas wie psychische Vorg ̈ange, die in pseudochemischer Sprache aus-gedr ̈uckt werden” (Jung,Psychologie und Alchemie,282; quoted in Tilton,Quest for the Phoenix,12with n.51). It should be noted, however, that Jung adds a footnote quoting the Italian TraditionalistJulius Evola, of all people: a reference that hardly inspires confidence in Jung’s historical ratherthan “spiritual” intentions, but further strengthens my suspicion that not occultism but Tradition-alism, probably more than Atwood or Hitchcock, and certainly more than Jung, is at the originof twentieth-century notions of “spiritual alchemy.” Similarly, Principe and Newman see Jung’sunderstanding of alchemy as derived from occultism, especially A. E. Waite (“Some Problems,”393–395,402),butthisisquestionedbyTilton(Quest,18–19) and deserves further study: note thatWa i t e ’sAzoth, central to Principe and Newman’s argument, is not among the seven volumes byWaite in Jung’s private library (Anon.,C.

The inner decay of alchemy began more than a century earlier,already in the time of Jacob B ̈ohme, when many alchemists left their retorts andcrucibles and devoted themselves exclusively to the hermetic philosophy. At thattime, thechemistseparated himself from thehermeticist. Chemistry became naturalscience, but hermeticism lost the empirical ground under its feet and lost its way inallegories and speculations that were as bombastic as they were empty of content,and merely lived off the memories of a better time. This better time, however, waswhen the spirit of the alchemist still truly struggled with the problems of matter,when the investigating mind was facing the realm of the unknown and believedto perceive forms and laws in it.117In other words, Jung calls purely “spiritual” alchemy a degenerate phe-nomenon! Further on in the article, we find the original version of thecontested sentence: “The decisive thing is, however, that we are deal-ing not at all [gar nicht], or at least for the greatest part not [wenigstenszum gr ̈oßten Teil nicht] with chemical experiments, but probably [vermut-lich] with something like psychic processes expressed in pseudo-chemicallanguage.”118Of course, these differences are significant. In revising theEranos lecture for hisPsychologie und Alchemie, Jung removed the radical“not at all” (which conflicted with the quotation just given) but also thecautious “probably.” As for the passage criticized by Newman and Principe:it was never there at all, but represents a mistranslation by Stanley Dell.Hence, we are dealing with a classic example of a scholarly “ghost.” Jung’sAmerican audience was led astray by the defective English version; andsince most of his followers were reading him with little or no interest inhistory of science anyway, they came away with the absurd idea, which Jungnever seems to have held, that alchemy as a historical phenomenon wasessentially unconcerned with laboratory processes. It would seem, then,that Principe’s and Newman’s criticism is applicable to the drift of popu-lar Jungian (mis)interpretations of alchemy – and to radical Traditionalistviews such as Evola’s, which they do not discuss – rather than to Jung’s ownwork; and the “spiritual alchemy” highlighted by Tilton was in fact dis-missed by the Swiss psychologist as “bombastic” and “empty of content.”All these are effects of what Shamdasani calls the “fictionalization” of Jungby later generations.The real problem of Jung’s perspective lies not in his attempt to interpretalchemical or gnostic symbolism as a reflection of unconscious processes,117Jung, “Erl ̈osungsvorstellungen,”13–14.118“Das Entscheidende ist aber, daß es sich gar nicht oder wenigstens zum gr ̈oßten Teil nicht umchemische Experimente handelt, sonder vermutlich um etwas wie psychische Vorg ̈ange, die inpseudochemischer Sprache ausgedr ̈uckt wurden” (ibid.,17)."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"292The truth of historybut in its adoption as a methodology by historians. It is in the nature ofpsychology to look for general patterns in the functioning of the mind, andtherefore a psychology that claims to be applicable to the collective psycheand its development through history will try to reduce specific events tounderlying dynamics of a more general and universal kind. The essenceof the historical approach, in contrast, consists in moving away from suchtheoretical generalizations and insisting on what can be empirically ascer-tained on the basis of primary sources: the specificity of unique events asthey have occurred in the “external” world, in all their detail and contextualcomplexity. This in itself makes Jungian psychology into an “antithesis tothe historical approach.”119What has not been sufficiently noted, however,is that the most direct models for Jung’s approach to history are to be found,once again, in the literature of German Romantic mesmerism. Thus, ina classic text by Jung on “The Meaning of Psychology for Modern Man”(1934), we seem to be reading a remarkably close paraphrase of the passagefrom Passavant that was quoted in the previous section:When we look at the history of humanity, we see only what happens on theoutermost surface of events – and even that distorted by the turbid mirror oftradition. But what hasreallybeen happening eludes the inquiring gaze of thehistorian, for the true historical event lies deeply hidden, experienced by all andobserved by none...Wars, dynasties, social upheavals, conquests, and religionsare but the most superficial symptoms of a secret basic attitude [Grundhaltung]of the soul of the individual, unknown to himself and hence transmitted by nohistorian; the founders of religions are perhaps still most instructive. The greatevents of world history are, at bottom, profoundly unimportant.120Unlike second-generation Eranos scholars such as Eliade and Corbin, Jungdoes not seem to have felt a strong emotional resistance against “history.”121Rather, he believed in a general evolution of human consciousness “fromchildhood to maturity,” but simply accorded so little importance to criticalhistoriography as an autonomous discipline that it never seems to haveoccurred to him to see it as a threat. The work of the historian wasevidently subordinate to that of the psychologist, because specific externalevents were dependent by definition on more universal and fundamental“internal” dynamics; and in the end, only the latter were truly important119Pietik ̈ainen,C. G. Jung and the Psychology of Symbolic Forms,114.120Jung, “Bedeutung der Psychologie,”55; and cf. Passavant, above, page265. Jung clearly meansthat history is “made” by “great men,” who are ultimately unconscious instruments of what Hegelwould have called the Absolute Spirit.121On the differences between Jung’s and Eliade’s approaches to history, see, for example, Pietik ̈ainen,C. G. Jung and the Psychology of Symbolic Forms,125–129."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The archetype of Eranos293to him. Of course, such a perspective condemns the specialized historianto the subservient role of providing the psychologist with data suitablefor illustrating the dynamics of the unconscious: the result is a “paint-by-numbers history of religions,” as humorously formulated by ArthurMcCalla, “in which [psychologists] provide the picture with its color-codeand invite historians to sit quietly and color it in.”122That historiographymight in fact be the more fundamental science of the two – since it candemonstrate, as formulated by Shamdasani, how “particular psychologiesbecame dominant through historically contingent events, and, not least,through the rescripting of history”123– is inconceivable within a Jungianparadigm.The incompatibility of Jungian psychology with the most basic prin-ciples of historical research is acknowledged even by scholars who areotherwise sympathetic towards Jung’s work,124and is hardly in need offurther demonstration.125Nevertheless, many historians of alchemy afterWorld War II seem to have found Jung’s perspective so attractive that theywere willing to overlook this fact. It is not so hard to understand why. Thestudy of alchemy was barely beginning to recover from its near-universalperception as “pseudo-scientific” nonsense by positivist historiography,126so specialists in this domain had a hard time explaining to their readers(or even to themselves) why it should be taken seriously at all. As WalterPagel admitted in his1948review of Jung, the vast literature on alchemystill left the reader with a “feeling of frustration” because it did not seemto amount to more than “a well illustrated catalogue of what appears tobe yet another human folly.”127Under such circumstances, Jung’s workwas bound to come as a breath of fresh air: all of a sudden, a “new andstartling perspective”128had become available, developed by a psychologistwho commanded respect for having studied more alchemical sources thananyone else, and who demonstrated that one could look at them froman angle that suddenly made the entire science/pseudoscience problem-atic look irrelevant. In short, while historians had been struggling against a122McCalla, “When is History not History?,”447.123Shamdasani,C. G.

One must not forget that in the1940sand1950s, when his first workson alchemy became available, Jung was a well-known psychologist but hadnot yet become the almost mythical hero of the post-1960s imagination.Nobody could yet predict that this new perspective was on its way towardsbecoming the new orthodoxy.Jung’s impact did not remain limited to alchemy alone. Academic studyof the “occult sciences” had seemed all but dead by the end of the nine-teenth century, but Jung’s psychology seemed capable of making the WasteLand revive, by causing “magic” and astrology to appear in a new lightas well. In this regard, his theory of “synchronicity” played a central role.Presented explicitly as an alternative to instrumental “causality,” it ques-tioned the most fundamental assumptions of post-Cartesian philosophyand Newtonian physics, replacing them with a psychological reformulationof analogy and “correspondences”: the very thing that positivist anthropol-ogy had rejected as the epitome of “magical superstition.”129Obviouslythis amounted to a systematic assault on the entire fabric of nineteenth-century positivism,130and illustrates Jung’s ambition of setting up psychol-ogy as the master-science relevant not just to the humanities, but perhapseven to physics. At the same time, the theory of synchronicity sought torehabilitate themagia naturalisof the Renaissance, by interpreting it inmodern psychological terms and harmonizing it with quantum mechan-ics as a more advanced alternative to post-Newtonian science. In short,avant-garde physics and depth psychology had joined forces to unmaskpositivism as “superstition” and announce the return of “magic” as sci-ence! Again, the success of this argument was remarkable. Apart fromthe fact that Jungian psychology has been adopted by the great majorityof practicing astrologers as their chief theoretical framework, resulting in129Jung, “Synchronizit ̈at” (and cf. his short Eranos lecture “ ̈Uber Synchronizit ̈at”). Against theCartesian dualism ofres extensaandres cogitans, synchronicity assumes a principle of non-causalconnection between mind and matter; against Newtonian physics it embraces the implications ofquantum mechanics as undermining classic materialism. Jung’s essay was published together witha text by the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who applied archetypal psychology to Kepler’s scientifictheories. Jung himself discussed Taoism, Theophrast, Plotinus, Pico della Mirandola, Agrippa,Paracelsus, Kepler, and Leibniz as “predecessors” of synchronicity (“Synchronizit ̈at,”69–90). Onanalogy and correspondences as the epitome of magical superstition, see above, pp.164–165,186,189–190(Tylor’s theory of magic), and cf. L ́evy-Bruhl, who was a significant influence on Jung(see, for example, Pietik ̈ainen,C. G. Jung and the Psychology of Symbolic Forms,151–154).130As such, the Jung/Pauli theory of synchronicity is in fact a late offshoot of the assault on “causality”typical of theLebensphilosophiethat came to dominate Weimar intellectual culture, including themilieus of mathematicians and theoretical physicists, immediately after Germany had lost the war(Forman, “Weimar Culture, Causality, and Quantum Theory”)."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Eranos and religionism: Scholem, Corbin, Eliade295the widespread popular phenomenon of “psychological astrology,”131Jung’stheory of “synchronicity” has proved attractive as a theoretical frameworkeven for modern historians of ancient astrology, as will be seen.Summing up: from the perspective of the academic study of “West-ern esotericism,” Jung’s essential contribution is that he took the basicidea (invented by German Romantic mesmerism, with Ennemoser as theparadigmatic example) of a history of the magical “nightside of nature”and its experiential manifestations, but repackaged it in modern psycho-logical terms as the history of Western culture’s suppressed unconscious.The result was an extremely attractive narrative with an internal logic allof its own, which has been widely adopted in popular culture since WorldWar II and – in spite of its evidently non-historical foundations – hasdeeply influenced scholars as well. Its basic concept is that of an esoteric“counter-tradition,”132that has always been present as the hidden – occult –“shadow” of the mainstream: from gnosticism and the ancient mysterycults, through alchemy and the other “occult sciences” (natural magic andastrology), to early modern thinkers like Paracelsus and his followers, toRomanticNaturphilosophie, mesmerism and, finally, modern psychology.In this narrative, the official representatives of the mainstream (Christiantheologians, rational philosophers, modern scientists) have always tried tosuppress it, but never with any lasting success, because, like the uncon-scious, it is the hidden secret of their own existence, the vital source withoutwhich they could not exist. The positive religions, particularly the mono-theistic ones, are “external” products of time and historical circumstance –they have had a beginning, and will have an end – but underneath them,there has always been this permanent and universal substratum: a kind ofobjective paganism expressing itself by symbols and myths, and groundedin the universal human search for self-knowledge, or gnosis.eranos and religionism: scholem, corbin, eliadeThe importance of Eranos for the study of “Western esotericism” lies ina specific approach to religion that came to dominate its proceedings andpublications, and was adopted as a matter of course by many of the scholarswho became interested in “hermetic” or “occult” traditions as an object of131Von Stuckrad,Geschichte der Astrologie,337,339–340,345.

In line with my earlier discussions, I willrefer to this approach as “religionism.” Rooted in the impossible dream ofa “history of truth,” it may be defined as the project of exploring historicalsources in search of what is eternal and universal. The paradoxical natureof any such attempt is obvious; and at least in its more sophisticatedrepresentatives, this sometimes lends religionism a quality of intellectualdaring bordering on the heroic. Each in their own way, and with particularvehemence after World War II, the religionists of Eranos were rebellingagainst the finality of history and time, change and impermanence – inshort, they refused the nihilist verdict that all things that appear to bemeaningful and true in human existence are just finite and transitory,ending in dissolution and death.The relative emphasis placed on either temporality or eternity was,however, different with each of these scholars. On the farthest “historical”side of the spectrum we find a thinker like Gershom Scholem (1897–1982),the pioneering scholar of Jewish kabbalah, who stood for critical philologyand historiography and only very rarely allowed his readers to catch aglimpse of his deepest motivations. His clearest statement is in a famousletter to his publisher, Zalman Schocken:For the Mountain, the body of things, needs no key; it is only the nebulous wallof history, which hangs around it, that must be traversed. To traverse it – that iswhat I have tried. Will I remain stuck in the nebula, so to speak, falling victimto “death by professorship?” But even where it requires sacrifice, there is just noalternative to the necessity of historical criticism and critical historiography.True, history may at bottom be an illusion, but an illusion without whichno perception of the essence is possible in time. The wondrous concave mirrorof philological criticism makes it possible for the people of today first and mostpurely to receive a glimpse, in the legitimate orders of commentary, of that mysticaltotality of the system, whose existence, however, vanishes in the very act of beingprojected onto historical time.From the first day to the present, my work has lived in this paradox, out of sucha hope for a true message from the Mountain – for that most trivial, tiniest shiftof history that makes truth erupt from the illusion of “development.”133133Scholem, “Birthday Letter,” in: Biale,Gershom Scholem,216, and Scholem,Briefei,472;andcf.Scholem, “Zehn unhistorische S ̈atze.” On the connection of these texts and their role in Scholem’sdevelopment, see the excellent analysis by Peter Sch ̈afer, “‘Philologie der Kabbala’.” See also theimportant passage from a highly perceptive article on Scholem by his pupil Joseph Weiss, publishedinYedioth hayom(December5,1947; reproduced in Sch ̈afer, “‘Philologie der Kabbala’,”22n.69),and Scholem’s affirmative reaction in a Hebrew letter to Weiss (March31,1960; not includedin the printed correspondence), reproduced in German translation by Sch ̈afer (“‘Philologie derKabbala’,”22–23).

He was deeply convinced thatthe very identity of contemporary Judaism was determined “by historicalconsciousness, by the feeling of a continuity with the past and a commonhope for the future,”134and his understanding of history was thereforeinseparable from a dimension of messianic expectation. From a Jewishperspective, history is the very condition that makes messianic fulfillmentpossible, even if it provides no guarantee about when, or how, or perhapseven whether the hope for a “message from the mountain” will be fulfilled.But at the same time, the fact that eternity cannot appear in time meansthat the hope that sustains Jewish identity through history can only becalled an “aspiration to the impossible.”135Under these conditions, thehistorian must have the courage to “descend into the abyss” of history,knowing that he might encounter nothing but himself, and guided bynothing but a desperate hope for the impossible: that against all humanlogic, the transcendent might inexplicably “break through into history”one day, like “a light that shines into it from altogether elsewhere.”136134Hamacher,Gershom Scholem,66. Hamacher points out that for Scholem, historical consciousnessin this sense was all the more important because, for him, it replacedHalakhahas the basis ofmodern Jewish identity.135Mos`es,L’ange de l’histoire,189.136Scholem, “Zum Verst ̈andnis der messianischen Idee,”25(and cf.7–8for how Scholem contrastedJewish ideas of salvation with Christian ones, which he deeply disliked because of what he called the“horrible smell” and “swindle” of pure interiority [letter to Georg Lichtheim about Simone Weil,1950,in:Briefeii,16]).

Here, the passage “without which no perception of the essenceis possible in time” ends as “in an unmessianic time”; and about the mountain without a key,one reads that “What we are missing is not a key, but only one thing: courage.

In his understanding of symbolism and myth inrelation to kabbalah, Scholem owed much to the perspectives of GermanRomanticism, notably Molitor (a major influence on Ennemoser, as we sawearlier) and Novalis, but also Schelling and von Baader; and the exact natureof his debt to A. E. Waite deserves further study.137These backgroundsmake it easier to understand why Scholem’s strict insistence on philologyand historical criticism as the only legitimate approach to the study ofJewish mysticism did not prevent him from feeling at home in Eranos,138with its emphasis on myth and symbolism as reflections of meta-historicaltruth, and did not prevent him from expressing feelings of deep spiritualkinship even with a declared enemy of historicism like Henry Corbin.139Itremains, nevertheless, that in his published writings he appears as the verymodel of a “historian’s historian,”140and in this regard it would have madelittle difference if he had chosen never to reveal his personal hopes andmotivations. Scholem is therefore best interpreted as a scholar who felt thetemptation of religionism but resisted it, explicitly and largely successfully.withamessage”(91/2Mystics,81). However, in the margin of his personal copy, Scholem wrote“i never said so!”137Kilcher,Sprachtheorie der Kabbala,331–345; Schulte, “‘Die Buchstaben’.” Mostly during the1920s,Scholem took the trouble to read everything that occultists (Eliphas L ́evi, Blavatsky, de Guaita,Papus, Saint-Yves d’Alveydre, Waite, Westcott, Crowley, Regardie, Pullen-Burry, MacGregor Math-ers, Steiner) had to say about “kabbala.” Usually the verdict was negative, as shown by his manymarginal notes (“Lying and deceitful,” “Nonsense,” “No!” and so on); but Scholem’s attitudetowards Waite is more complex than one might perhaps expect (Burmistrov, “Gershom Scholemund das Okkulte”).138ContraDan, “Gershom Scholem,”53–56, and “Foreword.” Dan is very convincing when hedescribes the sharp contrast between Jungian/Eliadian approaches and Scholem’s historicalapproach (“Foreword,”8–9); but he too easily reduces Eranos to just a “Jungian/Eliadean” project,and contrasts it with Scholem’s historicism in terms of simple opposition rather than dialecticaltension. Whereas Dan considers Scholem’s participation in Eranos as “belonging probably to themost difficult questions of his biography” (“Gershom Scholem,”53; cf. Wasserstrom’s initial “per-plexity” about the same point: “Response,”460), I would see Eranos as an indispensable key. Idelemphasizes that most of Scholem’s writings on the phenomenological aspects of kabbalah werewritten rather late in his career, and do reflect the influence of Eranos and its audience (Kabbalah:New Perspectives,11). For Scholem’s ironic dialectics, see his own reflections on Eranos, significantlytitled “Identifizierung und Distanz.”139See Scholem’s letter to Corbin on April5,1973(Briefeiii,69) and to his widow Stella Corbin onOctober26,1978(ibid.,193), where he writes that, for him, Corbin’s death meant “the loss of aspiritual brother.” These passages refute Wasserstrom’s contention that Scholem was “spirituallyunrelated” to the “esoteric blood brothers” Eliade and Corbin (Religion after Religion,13,butcf.53). As far as their publishedscholarshipis concerned, however, Corbin’s influence on Scholemappears to have been quite minor (Fenton, “Henry Corbin et la mystique juive,”161–162).140Wasserstrom,Religion after Religion,64."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Eranos and religionism: Scholem, Corbin, Eliade299Privately he may well have believed, or hoped, that events in time could besymbolic reflections of the eternal and universal; but he also knew that, ifso, the very act of “projection” concealed their source from the historian’sgaze.If Scholem was situated on the farthest “historical” side of the Eranosspectrum, Henry Corbin (1903–1978) certainly exemplified the opposite,radically “anti-historical” alternative. This does not mean that he dis-regarded the study of primary sources: on the contrary, he spent his lifestudying the works of Suhraward ̄ı, Ibn ‘Arabi and a range of other impor-tant Iranian theosophers in their original language, and his enormouscontribution to the study of medieval Islamic mysticism is undisputed.What it does mean is that he adopted the metaphysical perspective ofhis favorite authors as his own, and opposed it in the strongest possiblewordings against the “disease,” “profanation,” “corruption,” even “satanicinversion” represented by historical reductionism.141In so doing, he explic-itly took the perspective not of a historian, but of a philosopher in thephenomenological tradition of Husserl and Heidegger:142“visible, appar-ent, outward states, in short, phenomena, can never be the causes ofother phenomena. The agent is the invisible, the immaterial.”143In otherwords, whatever appears in empirical reality has its origin in a transcendentrealm: “anyhistorythat happens in this visible world is theimitationofevents that happened first in the soul, ‘in Heaven,’ and hence theplaceofhierohistory...cannot be perceived by the senses, for their significationrefers to another world.”144When Corbin spoke of “esotericism,” as hefrequently did, he meant a spiritual perspective – the only true one, in his141For example, Corbin, “L’imago Templi,”368(all references are to the complete edition of1980,notthe abridged version published in the Eranos Yearbook). “Historical reductionism” captures mostexactly what Corbin rejected under the term “historicism”: a kind of “historical consciousnessthat cannot conceive of a reality otherwise than from the perspective of its material genesis”(Corbin, “Science traditionnelle,”30).

As explained byhis close friend and colleague Seyyed Hossein Nasr,For Corbin, the essential distinction in Islamic esotericism, and notably in Sufism,between the exterior (zˆahir) and the interior (bˆatin), as well as the process thatrelates the exterior to the interior – theta’wˆıl, translated by him as hermeneu-tics, in reference to the original meaning of the term – together constitutetheonly methodfor accessing the truth, a method which is also the real meaning ofphenomenology.145All this makes it pointless to judge Corbin’s work by the criteria of academichistoriography: as Maria E. Subtelny bluntly puts it, he was simply “notinterested in historical truth.”146Overwhelming evidence for this fact canbe found in Corbin’s fundamental text “Theimago templiin Confrontationwith Profane Norms,” presented in abridged form at Eranos shortly beforehis death. Discussing a “filiation” from the original Judaeo-Christian com-munity and the Essenes, through the Templars and the Graal legend to theilluminism of eighteenth-century Masonic Templarism and Swedenborg’s“New Jerusalem,”147Corbin kept emphasizing that in order to understandit properly, one must take a position “beyond becoming and historicalcausality, beyond the norms of chronology, of filiations that require archivesand notarial documents to justify themselves.”148Theimagoof the Templeis claimed to exist at a level of reality – themundus imaginalis–thatisonto-logically prior to its earthly manifestation, and hence it is this transcendentimage that conditions and determines its historical manifestations, neverthe reverse.149Historical causality is therefore irrelevant by definition. Thisis why Corbin’s elaborate claims about “hidden connections” between earlyChristianity, the Essenes, Islamic mysticism, the medieval Templars, thelegend of the Graal, and Masonic neo-Templar traditions are declared byhim,ex cathedra, to be immune against any historical falsification. By thesame token, although Corbin’s own dependence on modern and contem-porary esotericism is obvious to the historian,150any critical objection on145Nasr, “Henry Corbin, ‘L’exil occidental’,”13–14.146Subtelny, “History and Religion,”93.147Corbin, “L’imago templi,”190–191. Interestingly, the specialist of Jewish mysticism Elliot Wolfsonappears to accept Corbin’s perspective as a valid textual hermeneutics in the study of religion anduses it to include Zoharic kabbalah as well (Wolfson, “Imago Templi”).148Corbin, “L’imago templi,”188.Cf.ibid.,190: “although there are historical traces, always hiddenunder the veil of what is known as ‘legends,’ it is not by these uncertain traces that we find theknights of the Temple,” for the true connections “are not of the kind that leave traces in archivaldocuments.”149Ibid.,191.150See notably his relation to Traditionalism (below, nn.155–156) and his involvement in the MartinistRite Ecossaise Rectifi ́e(below, page341with n.305)."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Eranos and religionism: Scholem, Corbin, Eliade301that basis would automatically be declared inadmissible and misguided.Corbin was not speaking about what, on the basis of his studies, he hadcome to see as the truth: Truth itself was being spoken through Corbin,and any objection therefore had to be false by definition.151Corbin had understood the depth of the conflict between “history” and“truth” perhaps more profoundly than any of his colleagues, with the excep-tion of Scholem. This conflict goes to the very heart of the modern study ofreligion, and hence of “Western esotericism” as well,152and has accompa-nied us like a red thread throughout this book. It is therefore important tounderstand it correctly. We are dealing with two types of reasoning that areinternally consistent but mutually exclusive. Both are capable of rejectingthe alternative on their own terms, but they share no common measure thatwould make it possible to decide which one is ultimately true or false.153When all is said and done, they are a matter of choice. Scholem chose thepath of historiography, more congenial to modern thinking, and acceptedthat the transcendent was thereby reduced to only a glimmer of hope atthe very limit of the human horizon. Corbin chose the narrow path ofmetaphysics, and accepted that this made him into an “occidental exile,”154speaking on behalf of a spiritual world that had become alien and incom-prehensible to practically all his contemporaries. One understands theattraction of his work among modern students of “Western esotericism,”for his vision of reality has an undeniable beauty, and his oeuvre commandsrespect for the depth of its intellectual vision. But admirers should not befooled about its unflinching dogmatism: no less radically than the Tradi-tionalist school of Ren ́eGu ́enon and Frithjof Schuon, Corbin rejected “themodern world” along with all its basic assumptions,155claiming exclusive151More precisely, Corbin saw the historian’s objections as based upon the blind assumptions of aworld that is not only in exile, but refuses, or is unable, to recognize that fact (ibid.,198–204).Living in this world, the “gnostic” is a “stranger” to it, because he has at least discovered the truenature of his condition, and knows that his true home is elsewhere.152See Hanegraaff, “Empirical Method.”153Cf. Hanegraaff, “Under the Mantle of Love,”176–177, about the strictly comparable case ofMarsilio Ficino’s platonic theory of love as compared to modern psychoanalysis.154Nasr, “Henry Corbin, ‘L’exil occidental’” (and cf. above, n.151).155For the core argument against modernity, see Corbin, “L’imago templi,”196–200,andcf.251.Wasserstrom associates Corbin’s antimodernism with fascism and antisemitism but, by his ownadmission, fails to find any evidence (Religion after Religion,155,179).

Critical discussion about these foundations was outof the question.156Representing two extreme options in the polar dynamics of religion-ism, Scholem ultimately sacrificed “truth” in the interest of history, whileCorbin sacrificed history in the interest of “truth” (the former with regret,the latter with relish). The third central figure of Eranos in the postwarperiod, Mircea Eliade (1907–1986), rather seems to represent the unre-solved paradox of religionism as such: as has often been noted, the disci-pline that he referred to as “history of religions” was in fact notable forits attempt to transcend history.157Unlike Scholem and Corbin, Eliadewas not a deep specialist in any particular religious tradition, and didnot spend his life reading primary sources in their original languages. Herelied essentially on secondary sources to provide him with informationon a wide variety of religious traditions, and his sympathizing ex-studentRobert Ellwood describes him quite correctly as “not at heart a scholar,much less a politician or social scientist, but a litterateur, a writer andliterary critic.”158It belongs to this profile that Eliade had little concern forquestions of methodology, as noted by another of his ex-students, Dou-glas Allen: “He simply looks at the religious phenomena, and he just ‘sees’these essential structures and meanings.”159It is therefore somewhat ironic –understandable though it may be, given the dominance of his “Chicagoschool” in the American study of religion, not to mention the posthumousscandal of his political past – that precisely Eliade’s oeuvre has become thefocus of intense methodological debate in the study of religion.160European scientific methods,” and highlighted the importance of German philosophers who wouldalways remain alien to Gu ́enon (Trang-Ni [Henry Corbin], “Regard vers l’Orient”; see Accart,“Identit ́eetth ́eophanie,”179–180).

See also Hakl’s remarks about Corbin’s problems with acceptingdisagreement (Verborgene Geist,347).157See, for example, McCalla, “When is History not History?,”435(“History is not history when itis the history of religions”) and437–438; Rudolph, “Mircea Eliade and the ‘History’ of Religions”;Alles, “Ist Eliade Antihistorisch?.”158Ellwood,Politics of Myth,124.159Allen, “Encounters,”14;andcf.Turcanu,Mircea Eliade,429–430.160The number of publications on this debate is overwhelming.

At thevery core of his oeuvre we do not find some theoretical conviction aboutthe correct way to study religion, but, very simply, a deep emotional needto find meaning in human existence. Eliade’s obsessive activity as a writer,beginning in his teenage years and continuing until his death, reflects aprofound awareness of transitoriness and death: “Everything passes. That ismyimmensepain...anintimateandneveradmittedobsession.”161Te m -porary relief from this oppressive awareness was granted only by specialmoments of “grace”: evident models of what Eliade would later refer to as“hierophanies.” Perhaps the most impressive example occurred one after-noon, when, as a small child, he discovered a room in the house that wasnormally closed:The emotion that I felt then nailed me to the ground. I found myself transportedinto a palace of legend. The blinds had been lowered and through the heavycurtains of green velvet filtered a pale light of emerald colour, rainbow-like andalmost supernatural. I felt as if I were inside a gigantic green grape. I stayedlike that for a long moment, motionless in the middle of the room, holding mybreath...Like great surfaces of clear water...the venetian mirrors reflected myimage, but larger, and more beautiful, more noble above all, surrounded by thatlight that seemed to me to come from another world.162fascism and antisemitism became impossible to deny (see Turcanu,Mircea Eliade,251–301andpassim; for perhaps the most shocking piece of evidence, see the journal of Eliade’s Jewish friendMihail Sebastian for March2,1937:Journal 1935–1944,113–114), scholars like Russell McCutcheonand Daniel Dubuisson have claimed that fascism and antisemitism are structurallyencodedinEliade’s scholarship. For a convincing deconstruction of the underlying procedures of discourseand rhetoric (which are typical also of Wasserstrom’s analysis of Eranos in hisReligion after Religion,and the earlier analysis by Holz, “ERANOS”) see Fisher, “Fascist Scholars, Fascist Scholarship.”As pointed out by Fisher, the taken-for-granted associations between fascism and concepts suchas “gnostic,” “esoteric,” “platonic,” or “neopagan” (along with, for example, “totalizing,” “anti-nomian,” “aesthetic,” “elitist,” “syncretist,” “Nietzschean,” “Faustian,” “amoral,” “lawless,”“organic,” and “antimodernist”:ibid.,264) are ultimately derived from the “Critical Theory”of the Frankfurt School, which came to enjoy great moral and intellectual prestige after WorldWar II (Fisher, “Fascist Scholars, Fascist Scholarship,”271–281;andseebelow,pp.312–313).161Eliade,Journal des Indes,24(Turcanu,Mircea Eliade,96,128). On the young Eliade’s obsessionwith writing and reading, see Turcanu,Mircea Eliade,23–24,27–30,71,78. For some time, he eventried to win more time by reducing his hours of sleep to four each night (ibid.,29).162Eliade,Promesses de l’ ́equinoxe,14. This experience served as a model for Stefan’s “secret room”in Eliade’s novelNoaptea de Sˆanzienze, later translated asThe Forbidden Forest(von Stuckrad,“Utopian Landscapes,”96–97). Eliade writes that for years, he trained himself in prolonging andartificially evoking such states of mind, always with success, but it finally brought unbearablesadness because he now knew that the world of the secret room was gone forever (Promesses del’ ́equinoxe,11,14–15). Particularly illuminating in this regard is a passage attributed to Eliade by hisfriend Corbin: “To be like a child means being a newborn, being re-born to another spiritual life;in short, being an initiate. Contrary to all other modes of being, the spiritual life knows of no lawof becoming, for it does not develop in time. The ‘newborn’ is not a baby who will grow up in"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"304The truth of historyReferring to the great importance that such “magical moments” had forEliade, Ellwood speaks of him as having lived “a life governed by nostalgia:for childhood, for historical times past, for cosmic religion, for paradise,”163and his biographer Florin Turcanu concurs that “the famousillud tempusthat Eliade talks about, the primordial time evoked by myths, is identifiedon another level with the time of childhood and its particular relation tothe world.”164Whereas Corbin was inspired by very similar emotions andpersonal experiences165but went on to embrace a consistent metaphysi-cal worldview, I see no indication that Eliade ever did so. At bottom, hisfamous notion of the “terror of history” does not refer to any specific formof “historicism” either, but quite simply to the painful experience that inthe prosaic reality of adult human existence, it appears that “things justhappen,” without any apparent reason or deeper meaning. The experi-ence of war during his childhood, including the bombing of Bucharest in1916,166seems to have affected him deeply, and his frantic workpace canbe explained at least partly as reflecting a continuous struggle against hisdepressive tendencies.167In his pivotalMyth of Eternal Recurrence, writtenunder the impact of the traumatic events of World War II and Eliade’sown exile from Romania, we find him reacting with deep emotion to theterrors and atrocities of history, and stressing that human beings somehowneed to “defend” themselves against the nihilistic view that “everythingthat happens is ‘good,’ simplybecauseit has happened.”168Eliade never says that historical eventsdohave a meaning, either inthemselves or as a reflection of some “deeper” or “inner” dynamics, andcontrary to Corbin and even Scholem, he never developed any conceptof a “meta-historical” reality: his many references to “the Sacred” remainorder to die one day.

I find little theoretical depth and consistency in this famouschapter on “The Terror of History,” which ends even more strangely with a simple appeal toChristian faith in God as modern man’s only defense against “despair” (ibid.,159–162).

This mythmust be re-invigorated if life still has some meaning, if it still deserves to be lived.170Elsewhere in his private journal, Eliade was even more implicit about hiswork as a means of “escaping History, of saving myself through symbol,myth, rites, archetypes.”171In his search for “escapes” from historical reality, Eliade explored a widevariety of ancient and contemporary “esoteric” currents as well. GermanRomantic culture always remained somewhat alien to him, but occultistauthors played a role in awakening the youthful Eliade’s interest in com-parative religion and the Orient, and convincing him of the reality of para-normal phenomena.172Alchemy was another early fascination, likewise169Faivre, “L’ambiguit`a della nozione del sacro,”368: the ontological status of the Sacred “remainsambiguous by lack of precision.

Coomaraswamy, andJulius Evola. While he tried to conceal his debt to these thinkers,177PaolaPisi has demonstrated beyond any doubt that they were decisive influenceson a range of central concepts in Eliade’s mature oeuvre, notably the sym-bolism of the “center,” his notion of “reintegration,” and his understand-ing of “archetypes.”178The two most important theoretical chapters of hisof Mircea Eliade,”150. In an early article in a school journal, titled “S,tiint, ̆as,i ocultism” (“Scienceand Occultism”;1925), he reacted to a skeptic schoolmate by expressing his firm belief in para-normal phenomena while trying (characteristically) “to crush his adversary under the weight of abibliography” dominated by occultists and parapsychologists (Turcanu,Mircea Eliade,40).173For the general development of Eliade’s interest in alchemy, see Turcanu,Mircea Eliade,42–43,85–86,232–234,251. Eliade’s brochureAlchimia asiatic ̆a(1935) was “based upon one master-idea: alchemy is not a ‘proto-chemistry,’ it is not a ‘proto-science,’ but an autonomous spiritualdiscipline whose reasonings and goals have nothing to do with the intellectual instruments andthe results of modern chemical experiments” (Turcanu,Mircea Eliade,233). This belief developedprior to and independently of Jung (whose views were more ambivalent in any case, as seenabove, pp.289–291). Already Eliade’s teacher Nae Ionescu appears to have presented alchemy asmysticism, probably under the influence of Evelyn Underhill (Pisi, “I ‘traditionalisti’,”92n.36), butEliade’s “panvitalist” and soteriological interpretation was dependent on Gu ́enon and Evola (ibid.,49–51).174Eliade,Contribut,ii la filosofia Renas,terii(1928), available in French translation asContributions`ala philosophie de la Renaissance; see discussion in Turcanu,Mircea Eliade,112–115. Looking backat this dissertation at the end of his life, Eliade clearly projected post-Yatesian understandings of“Renaissance hermeticism” back onto his own early work.175See overview in Faivre, “Modern Western Esoteric Currents in the Work of Mircea Eliade,”150–154.176Tu r c a n u ,Mircea Eliade,360–361.177For example, Eliade,Viat, ̆aNou ̆a,212(as quoted/translated in Spineto, “Mircea Eliade and Tradi-tionalism,”68n.48): “Tuliu [the hero of his novel] will say things which . . .

Pisi shows that, again, Eliade’s understanding of archetypesis not derived from Jung but from Coomaraswamy (ibid.,66–69).

He did not accept the notions ofa “primordial tradition,” an initiatic transmission of traditional knowledge,and cyclical decline, and, most importantly, he interpreted Traditionalistbeliefs not as metaphysical truths, but as expressions of the fundamentalneeds ofhomo religiosus: man’s (and Eliade’s) desire for unity and reintegra-tion in the life of the cosmos, as an emotional response to the existentialanguish of temporal being.180As suggested by his enormous popularity, Eliade’s books do seem to havebeen experienced as “therapeutic” by a wide postwar readership, includingmany academics.181They clearly answered a widely felt need for alternativesto the dominant trends of thought – notably, in Eliade’s own words,existentialist pessimism and “the chaos and meaninglessness of modernlife”182– and became essential parts of theZeitgeistof the1960s.183Achievingworld fame in this period, the Romanian exile with his unfamiliar approachended up dominating the academic study of religion in the United States.As all his previous books now began to be translated, at least one newtitle by Eliade appeared in English every year between1958and1965,andalmost all of them became bestsellers.184This boom coincided with theno less spectacular popularity of Carl Gustav Jung, along with a range offurther authors associated with Eranos, all made widely available in Englishby the financial support of the Bollingen Foundation.185The result was aremarkable transference of Eranos scholarship concerned with religion,myth and symbolism from Europe to the United States.

It is only in1974that Eliade brieflysketched the general outlines of such a historiographical project, under theinfluence of Frances Yates’ concept of the Hermetic Tradition and probablyof Antoine Faivre’s work: in his essay “The Occult and the Modern World”(1974) he referred to a “secret ‘occult’ tradition” represented by gnosticismand hermeticism in antiquity, reviving in the Italian Renaissance and its“longing for a universalistic, transhistorical, ‘mythical’ religion,” continuedby the “vogue of occultism” in nineteenth-century France, and culminatingin the “occult explosion” of the1970s.188Prior to this, Scholem had beendevoting his life to recovering the “esoteric” dimensions of Judaism, andfrom a very different perspective, Corbin had done the same for Islam;189but perhaps surprisingly, a similar project focused on the third of the greatscriptural religions, Christianity, had not taken shape, and began to emergeonly during the1970s in the work of Antoine Faivre.If Judaism and Islam were believed to have their own “esoteric” tradi-tions, what exactly did that mean in the context of Eranos prior to Faivre?186In this regard, the essential factor was the “Critical Theory” of the Frankfurt School: discussionbelow, pp.312–313,andcf.above,n.160.187On the role of these two authors at Eranos, see Hakl,Verborgene Geist,232–240and329–337.188Eliade,Occultism, Witchcraft, and Cultural Fashions, quotations on49,55–56,58.

Lory, “Sexual Intercourse,”49–50)."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Eranos and religionism: Scholem, Corbin, Eliade309As pointed out by Moshe Idel, Scholem’s understanding was based uponthe idea of a sharp antagonism between “a Kabbalistic mode of thoughtmotivated by a mythical universe, and the ‘history-saturated’ conscious-ness of the rabbinic mind”;190and, moreover, Scholem maintained thatthis mythical universe, deeply informed by the paganism of the ancientNear East, had entered Judaism “from outside,” so to speak, by way ofgnosticism.191In short, Scholem saw Jewish “esotericism” as an eruptionof mythical consciousness into the historical consciousness of rabbinicJudaism, triggered by contact with non-Jewish sources. But at the sametime, it is precisely in these products of pagan–monotheistic syncretismthat he perceived the true, “living heart” that had kept Judaism alive, asopposed to the dry and stifling legalism of the rabbinic counterpart:192somehow, then, its essence was not exclusively Jewish, for the mythicaldimension lent a more universal quality to it. In the case of Corbin, the sit-uation is easier to summarize: he saw “esotericism” quite simply as the true,hidden or inward dimension of exoteric Islam, known only to the mysticsand visionaries and imperceptible to the historian. What we find, then, isthat both thinkers claimed, for their respective fields, that the true “vitalessence” of monotheistic religions wasnotto be found in their external,historical, doctrinal, and legalistic193manifestations, but only in a moreuniversal, experiential dimension dominated by myth, symbolism, and thereligious imagination, and ultimately focused on a superior knowledge ofdivine mysteries, or “gnosis.” This “inner” (“esoteric”) dimension was seenas the true secret – the “well of turbulent vitality” in Scholem’s words –of “outward” (“exoteric”) religion.194We will see that until the early1990s,very much the same perspective dominated Antoine Faivre’s understandingof “esotericism” in Christian culture.190Idel, “Rabbinism versus Kabbalism,”289.191Ibid.,283,291.192On the centrality, in Scholem’s oeuvre, of the idea “that Judaism was kept alive by the revival,in mysticism, of the mythical-magical worldview,” in the context of his organic understanding ofJudaism as “living religion” and its roots in Romanticism and contemporaryLebensphilosophie,see Hamacher,Gershom Scholem,195–227(here195); on the “regenerating” virtue of myth andmysticism, see also Biale,Gershom Scholem,113–147.193On the anti-legalistic dimension in both Scholem and Corbin, see Wasserstrom,Religion afterReligion,57–59.194See the opening quotation. If we go back to the last paragraph of the previous section, and comparethis perspective with the narrative that emerged from Carl Gustav Jung’s approach, one can seehow easily the two can merge. Nevertheless, Scholem did not accept Jung’s theory of archetypes,and was irritated about David Biale’s suggestions concerning Jungian leanings in his work (Biale,Gershom Scholem,145–146;Scholem,Briefeiii,199), but see the perceptive remarks by Wolfson,Through a Speculum,56–57n.21. As for Corbin, see, for example, “L’imago templi,”288,290,322:Corbin was respectful towards Jung and quotes him from time to time in his writings, but sawarchetypes as metaphysical (celestial), not psychological realities."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"310The truth of historyThe ambitions of Scholem and Corbin were thereforenotlimited to thestraightforward agenda of “filling in the gaps” of traditional historiography,by calling attention to a series of historical currents that had been neglectedby previous scholars (merkabah mysticism, medieval kabbalah, Lurianictheosophy, Suhraward ̄ı’sishr ̄aqischool, Ibn ‘Arabi’s mysticism, Ismaelism,Sufism, and so on). They were after something bigger as well: nothing lessthan an answer to the question of what is true and of lasting value in Judaismand Islam, and ultimately in the scriptural religions as such. In other words,underneath the historiographical project there was a normative one, whichvaluated “myth and mysticism” much higher than mere “legalism anddoctrine.” Now, the problem is that such normative judgments may beappropriate for philosophers or theologians, but cannot be supported onthe basis of historical evidence. In the sources available to the historian, onesimply does not discover anything about the truths or values of Judaismor Islam: all one will ever find is a wide variety of conflictingclaimsandopinionsabout such truths and values. One may perhaps regret this fact,but it cannot be avoided: the moment a scholar leaves the position ofimpartiality or “methodological agnosticism” and starts favoring some ofthese claims and opinions as more true or valuable than others, he startspracticing what I have been referring to as “eclectic historiography” on thebasis of some philosophical or theologicalapriori.Even Scholem, the “historian’s historian,” did not entirely succeedin avoiding this temptation. As pointed out by Steven Wasserstrom, inScholem’s writings and, much more extremely, those of Corbin, the “eso-teric” dimensions were promoted from a position of marginality to one ofcentrality with Judaism and Islam, at the expense of the purely doctrinal,legalistic, and other “exoteric” dimensions that have in fact dominatedmuch of the beliefs and practices of ordinary Jews and Muslims.195Thisemphasis is understandable as a reaction against the eclecticism of previousscholars, who had marginalized and suppressed “mysticism” as irrelevanttotheirideas of “true” Judaism and Islam;196but this does not make itany more correct as a general statement about those religions. Presenting195Wasserstrom,Religion after Religion,52,cf.98,174,180–182,239–241(one need not share theauthor’s polemical stance to appreciate the basic point); Wasserstrom, “Response,”461–462; Algar,“Study of Islam”; cf. Masuzawa, “Reflections on the Charmed Circle,”435–436.ProvokedbyIdel’s “Rabbinism versus Kabbalism,” Joseph Dan recognizes Scholem’s “strict, almost asceticconcentration on the field of Jewish mysticism” and his complete avoidance of such dimensionsas Jewish philosophy, Halakhah, or Talmud, but claims that he was merely restricting himself tohis own field of expertise (“Gershom Scholem,”36with n.36referring to Idel).196For the paradigmatic case of Heinrich Graetz in the case of Judaism, see Sch ̈afer, “‘Adversuscabbalam’.”"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Eranos and religionism: Scholem, Corbin, Eliade311“esoteric” dimensions as the true “vital core” of a religion is possible onlyby adopting some kind of “essence versus manifestation” scheme, in whichthe great majority of believers have supposedly been oblivious to the truenature of their own religion, which is known only to a mystical elite – andsome scholars studying them.197Such essentialism is a belief, not a fact ofhistory. By adopting it nevertheless, one replaces the historian’s perspectivewith that of the metaphysician or theologian. The “study of esotericism”then becomes a crypto-philosophical or crypto-theological pursuit thatfeels free to move beyond history towards a “higher knowledge” aboutwhat, behind the surface of events or on a deeper and more “inward” level,is supposed to be “really” going on. One might be tempted to concludethat quite a lot of what has been presented as the “study of esotericism”since the1960s has, to a greater or lesser extent, fallen prey to this religionisttemptation. But it is perhaps more correct that many scholars embracedit with enthusiasm, because at some level of consciousness they shared thedream of escaping from history.Originating in Jungian approaches and developing into new directionsafter World War II, Eranos may be considered the classic example of“religionism,” and a predominant model for how Western esotericismhas come to be understood from the1960s. InChapter2, discussing itsemergence in the decades around1700, I referred to religionism as anapproach to religion that presents itself as “historical” but neverthelessdenies, or strongly minimizes, the relevance of questions pertaining tohistorical “influences,” and hence of historical criticism, because of itscentral assumption that the true referent of religion does not lie in thedomain of human culture and society but only in a direct, unmediated,personal experience of the divine;198and at the beginning of this section,I referred to it more briefly as “the project of exploring historical sourcesin search of what is eternal and universal.” But we have seen that in thesame period that saw the emergence of religionism, there also emergeda counter-paradigm based upon Enlightenment assumptions, which sawReason as the universal yardstick for evaluating the truth or seriousnessof any worldview. Religious or philosophical currents that were perceivedas not satisfying the criterion of rationality lost their right to be taken197On history of religions as a disclosure of hidden meanings, see the pertinent remarks by HughUrban, who points out how closely Wasserstrom’s attempt to unveil the “secrets” of Eranosscholarship resembles the approach that he criticizes (“Syndrome of the Secret,”439–440). Cf. the“gnostic study of religion” (practiced by scholars who claim to understand “secrets” about religionthat escape the common practitioner) advocated by Jeffrey J. Kripal, and my critical objections inHanegraaff, “Leaving the Garden.”198Above,Chapter2,pp.126–127,149."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"312The truth of historyseriously in intellectual discourse, and were relegated to the waste-basketcategory of “prejudice,” “superstition,” “foolishness,” or “stupidity.” In thatprocess, they were tacitly divested of their traditional status as players in thefield of history, and transformed into non-historical universals of humanthinking and behavior: they no longer needed to be discussed as traditions(“platonism,” “hermeticism,” even “paganism”), but could be dismissed assynonymous with irrationality as such.If Eranos was the main twentieth-century manifestation of religionism,the alternative Enlightenment paradigm was continued in the decadesbefore and after World War II by a philosophical school associated withtheInstitut f ̈ur Sozialforschungin Frankfurt, and known as Critical Theoryor the Frankfurt School.199Grounded in Marxist assumptions and dom-inated by Jewish intellectuals, its moral prestige after1945was above anysuspicion; and its understanding of totalitarianism would remain remark-ably authoritative in Germany and the United States in spite of the ColdWar, even after the full extent of the Stalinist terror was revealed to theWestern public by the publication of Solzhenitsyn’sGulag Archipelagoin1973. The history of how Critical Theory has impacted the perception of“Western esotericism” among intellectuals after World War II, particularlyin Germany, deserves a major study; but for our present concerns, it suf-fices to point out that the background assumptions of critical theoristsabout concepts such as “magic” or “the occult”200display no theoreticaloriginality but are derived straight from the “waste-basket” approach of theEnlightenment as analyzed in the previous chapter. The element of inno-vation in Critical Theory was that it posited a straight connection betweensuch “irrationalism” and fascism, thereby suggesting that the entire fieldof myth, symbolism, mysticism, gnosis, or esotericism was, by definition,tainted with dangerous political and immoral implications. Georg Luk ́acsdeveloped the basic argument about “irrationalism” and fascism in hisclassic studyDie Zerst ̈orung der Vernunft, based upon the Marxist adapta-tion of Hegelian belief in an inseparable connection between Reason andhistorical progress.201From this perspective there could be no such thingas a “history of esotericism” in any strict sense, for irrationalism has noautonomous existence by definition: as Luk ́acs put it, it can never be more199Jay,Dialectical Imagination; Wiggershaus,Frankfurt School; Bottomore,Frankfurt School and itsCritics.200For example, Adorno, “Theses Against Occultism”; Horkheimer and Adorno,Dialects of Enlight-enment.201Luk ́acs,Zerst ̈orung der Vernunft,111.

In the wake of Luk ́acs, Horkheimer, and Adorno,these basic assumptions became a dominant factor in the thinking of left-leaning intellectuals and academics after World War II; and particularly inGermany, the result was a virtual taboo on the study of anything relatedto esotericism or the occult, except of course from a perspective ofIdeolo-giekritik. Any wish to do research in such domains from a strictly historicalperspective became suspicious by definition, as it seemed to reflect anunhealthy fascination with the perennial enemy of reason and progress,and could always be interpreted as a front for covert apologeticism onbehalf of dangerous anti-democratic ideas. Most of the critical attacks onEranos by academics have been inspired, directly or indirectly, by theseassumptions typical of Critical Theory and the Frankfurt School;203andmany scholars of Western esotericism have, at some point in their career,been forced to defend themselves against the suspicion of holding far-rightsympathies.204Although the religionist and Enlightenment paradigms are one another’scounterpart, we have seen that they have more in common than one mightthink. Already in their original manifestations around1700, they were basedupon ideological axioms rather than empirical research, and as a result theywere seriously deficient as methodological frameworks for the study of his-tory. The anti-apologetic alternative to both, which combined a method-ology of historical criticism with a theoretical focus on the “Hellenizationof Christianity,” could have developed into a proper academic study ofWestern esotericism; but its potential never came to fruition because theentire domain was dropped from the history of philosophy after Brucker,no other discipline took it up, and the Enlightenment paradigm came todominate how it was perceived by intellectuals and academics. The resultwas a sharp decline of serious scholarship in the field, as we have seen,202Ibid.,92–93. Cf. James Webb’s notion of occultism as a “flight from reason” (Occult Establishment,8andpassim).203Evident examples are Wasserstrom,Religion after Religion; Dubuisson,Twentieth Century Mytholo-gies; McCutcheon,Manufacturing Religion. In my opinion, the academic debate about theseinfluential studies will remain unsatisfactory unless their underlying theoretical and methodolog-ical assumptions are made into an object of critical analysis. For a first step in that direction, seeFisher, “Fascist Scholars, Fascist Scholarship.”204See, for example, Laurant, “Politica Hermetica.” Obviously I do not mean to suggest that suchsuggestions are never correct, although they often are. My point is that they tend to be based onan ideology that makes study of Western esotericism “tainted” by default, so that scholars can beattacked for fascist tendencies even in the absence of any demonstrable evidence."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"314The truth of historyfinally resulting in the Waste Land of the nineteenth century. Eranos wasthe first major reaction to this state of affairs, but turned into the vanguardof a new form of religionism that studied history in the hope of findingways to transcend it. Critical Theory, for its part, perpetuated the unhistor-ical ideology of the alternative Enlightenment paradigm, thereby nippinghistorical research in the bud and declaring it politically suspect by defini-tion. Caught in the middle between religionist and rationalist ideologies,the historiographical tradition in this field was therefore abandoned fortwo centuries, resulting in alarming levels of ignorance among intellectualsand academics. But fortunately, it had not vanished for good. In the1960sthe core approach of the anti-apologetic tradition began to return to theacademy at last, under the flag of “the Hermetic Tradition.”the return of the historians:from peuckert and thorndike to frances yatesThe preceding discussions might almost make one forget that specializedhistorians working in specific fields were continuing quietly to go abouttheir core business of exploring the sources of the past, usually withoutmuch concern for such things as the “crisis of the modern world,” exis-tential anxieties about being imprisoned in time, or crypto-metaphysicalprojects of transcending history in view of some kind of salvational gnosis.Since the final decades of the nineteenth century, classicists and philologistsbegan the work of recovering the manuscript sources of ancient hermetism,magic, astrology, and alchemy;205and on those foundations, serious his-torical research in these domains began to flourish around the turn ofthe century, with scholars such as Auguste Bouch ́e-Leclercq, Franz Boll,Richard Reitzenstein, Wilhelm Bousset, Wilhelm and Josef Kroll, WalterScott, and many others: a tradition that culminated finally in classics suchas, notably, Andr ́e-Jean Festugi`ere’s monumental four-volume studyLar ́ev ́elation d’Herm`es Trism ́egiste(1944–1954).

Yates, which will be the main topic ofthis section, only two authors produced works of such a kind on a highscholarly level.The first of these two, Will-Erich Peuckert (1895–1969), has remainedvirtually unknown outside the German-speaking domain. None of hisworks were translated, and he left no pupils to continue his approach,so that his oeuvre has remained an isolated phenomenon in spite of itspioneering importance.207In the present context, Peuckert deserves atleast a brief discussion because he was the first modern scholar to take upthe prematurely abandoned historiographical tradition that had led fromEhregott Daniel Colberg to Jacob Brucker, and to make a new attemptat reconstructing the forgotten world of “Platonic-Hermetic Christianity”from the original sources.208Like Frances Yates after him, he pointedtowards the Italian humanism of Florence as the origin of a new tradition of“magic” that had become central to Renaissance culture; and, like AntoineFaivre, he traced this lineage further through the predominantly Germantraditions of Paracelsianism, Christian theosophy, andNaturphilosophiefrom the sixteenth century through the eighteenth. Peuckert’s primary fieldwas that ofVolkskunde(“folkloristics,” or “European ethnology”), but hisimportance for us lies in his series of monographs on Paracelsus, SebastianFranck, Jacob B ̈ohme, Rosicrucianism, astrology, and, most importantof all, his best-known bookPansophieand its sequels,GabaliaandDasRosenkreutz.209In spite of his explicit references to Colberg, the conflict between “pagan”philosophies and biblical Christianity did not loom very large in Peuckert’sperspective. Instead, what he perceived was a momentous conflict betweenthe declining rural world of the medieval farmers (die b ̈auerliche Welt), andthe newly emerging bourgeois world (die b ̈urgerliche Welt) dominated by(1928); Grillot de Givry,La mus ́ee des sorciers, mages et alchimistes(1929); de Campigny,Les traditionset les doctrines ́esot ́eriques(1939).207Apart from an unpublished Ph.D. dissertation that concentrates on other aspects of Peuckert’soeuvre (Jacobsen, “Boundary Breaking and Compliance”), the only discussion of Peuckert inEnglish is Hanegraaff, “Will-Erich Peuckert.” The only important discussion in German isZimmermann, “‘Ich gebe die Fackel weiter!’.”208Peuckert was explicit about placing himself in this lineage: seePansophie,viii.

In describing how these “two streamsburst upon one another”210in the early modern period, Peuckert was stillthinking in the organic and teleological terms of Romantic historiography:throughout his work, historical periods and cultures are described as if theyare living organisms whose potentials and destinies are already implicit intheir seeds, and that possess an inner drive towards attaining their fullpotential. The magical worldview described inPansophieandGabaliaisseen as organically rooted in the rural Middle Ages, and Peuckert wants toshow that, far from simply declining or vanishing in the face of modernity,“only now, stirred by some impulse, it unfolded its most seductive blos-som...[F]rom this ‘decay,’ thereemerged an unheard-of world that stillremains wholly unknown to us.”211This new spiritual worldview or religious mentality, which Peuckertcalls “pansophy,” began to emerge in Renaissance Florence but was lackingin vitality there and might have remained no more than an unfulfilledpromise.212It only revealed its full potential after having been transportedto German soil, in theNaturphilosophieof Paracelsus and his followers,finally culminating in the Christian theosophy of Jacob B ̈ohme, and con-tinuing through a string of later and lesser representatives as far as into theeighteenth century. Highlighting Goethe’sFaustas its archetypal expres-sion, Peuckert described pansophy as a quintessentially German perspectiveultimately grounded in the platonic notion, as expounded by Ficino, ofthe two “wings of the soul”: the wing of the intellect that allows us topenetrate the secrets of nature, and the wing of mystical contemplationby which we are lifted directly to the Absolute.213Once transposed to theGerman context, the two wings are transformed into a doctrine of twolights(the “Light of Nature” and the “Light of Grace”) and twobooks(the“Book of Nature” and the Bible). This notion of two complementary waysof knowledge was the Ariadne’s thread by which Peuckert led his readersthrough the labyrinth of forgotten “pansophical” texts, often by means oflong quotations. He did so with an infectious enthusiasm and very impres-sive erudition, and his books remain a pleasure to read for those who canappreciate his inimitable style of writing; but although Peuckert became210Peuckert,Pansophie,x.211Ibid.,xi.212On Peuckert’s description of Florentine platonism as a beautiful but somewhat decadentfin-de-si`ecleestheticism, in contrast to the healthy, practical, earthy mentality of the German commonman, as exemplified by Paracelsus, see Hanegraaff, “Will-Erich Peuckert,”296–297.213Peuckert,Pansophie,12–15, quoting Walser,Gesammelte Studien,277–278. The central referencefor Peuckert and Walser is Lorenzo de’ Medici’s poem “Altercazione,” in which Ficino appears asa musician singing Orphic hymns, and responds to Lorenzo’s melancholy by evoking the platonicimage of the two wings (Lorenzo de’ Medici,Poemi,71–102)."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"The return of the historians317a recognized authority ofVolkskundeduring the final decades of his life,appointed to what would remain the only German chair in that disci-pline for many years, his name was already met with “an apathetic reserve”two years after his death in1969,214andheleftnopupilstocontinuehisresearches into the “pansophical” tradition.

His first two volumes dealt with the first thirteencenturies, going systematically through a large string of authors and anony-mous works; the next two volumes showed an increasing expansion of thescale of treatment, dealing with the fourteenth and fifteenth centuriesalone; and this trend was continued in two further volumes about thesixteenth century and two final ones devoted to the seventeenth. To this,one should add a “veritable forest of Appendices”222(sixty-two in number)and very detailed Indices that made the set into an encyclopedic work ofalmost inexhaustible richness. Although the scope of Thorndike’smagnumopusmight seem to make him into a specialist of the Renaissance and earlymodernity as much as of the Middle Ages, he in fact disliked the conceptof a “Renaissance,” and emphasized the continuity of ancient and medievalthought into modernity.223In spite of its obvious contribution to scholarship, Thorndike’s workwas initially received with considerable harshness, even hostility, from thedirection of classical philology and history of science.224For our concerns,it is particularly important to look at the reaction to his work by thedoyen of history of science, George Sarton. In a large review of the firsttwo volumes of Thorndike’sHistory,in1924, Sarton had to admit thatby studying “an enormous amount of repellent material” the author had219Thorndike and Kibre,Catalogue of Incipits; and supplement published inSpeculum14(1939),93–105.

Sarton emphasized (italics in the original) that“science is essentially a cumulative, a progressive activity,” characterized byrationality and skepticism.227Magic was presented as its radical opposite:“[o]ne irrational idea is as good as another. To speak of evolution ofmagic is thus a contradiction in terms.”228We have encountered thistype of argument before, and need not analyze it again.229In Sarton’sformulation,science is essentially progressive, while magic is essentially conservative. There canbe no compromise between them; they cannot possibly walk together – for oneis going forwards, and the other backwards. All that they can do is to hinderand fight one another. One might thus properly write a history of the warfare ofexperimental science and magic, but it should be noted that Thorndike’s thesisis exactly the opposite. He would make us believe that the magician...was theancestor of the modern investigator; that reason is the fruit of unreason; and truth,of superstition and occultism.230225Sarton, review of Lynn Thorndike (1924),88–89.226Ibid.,83.Seealsop.79(“to call such a book a ‘history of experimental science’ is a joke, and avery bad one at that”; most readers’ familiarity with scientific knowledge will unfortunately be“on the same level as the author’s and [they] will thus be unable to realize how completely theyare deceived”; the work will “become an abundant source of misunderstanding, and will workconsiderable harm”),81(“the confusion of Thorndike’s ideas”),83(“this elaborate parody of thehistory of medieval science”),84(“Nonsense!”). Even Sarton’s close collaborators appear to havebeen shocked by his outburst, and it is remarkable that, somehow, the two scholars still “continuedin friendly disagreement” (see Thorndike, “Some Letters of George Sarton,”324–325). In hisreview of volumes3and4, Sarton acknowledged that as “a palaeographic virtuoso,” Thorndikehad “placed himself in the foreground of scholarship with the first two volumes” (review of LynnThorndike [1935],471), but went on to repeat his fundamental criticism in milder terms. In1957,two years after Sarton’s death, Thorndike received the George Sarton medal of the History ofScience Society (Anon., “Award of the George Sarton Medal”).227Sarton, review of Lynn Thorndike (1924),78,80.228Ibid.,81.229See above,Chapter3,pp.167–168(the reification of “magic”); pp.184–189(discussion of BrianVickers), p.196(the “Conflict Thesis”).

By implication,“magic” was seen as a historical phenomenon capable of change anddevelopment; and as such, it would have to be taken seriously byhistorians of science.(2) Once this step was taken, a further one was bound to follow: eventhe very distinction between magic and experimental science no longerappeared to be so clearcut. Particularly in the medieval context, theboundaries became blurred: rather than with a situation of magicinfluencing science, one might be dealing with a situation where thetwo could no longer be distinguished. As a result, not only wouldhistorians of science have to take magic seriously, but they wouldinevitably become historians of magic themselves!(3) It followed, furthermore, that the Middle Ages could no longer be seenas an age of darkness and decline into superstition and ignorance –“ancient science gradually smothered by the luxuriant growth ofmedieval magic,”233in Sarton’s words – but had to become an entirelylegitimate period of continuous scientific exploration.(4) As a further implication, the sharp boundary between medieval “magic”and modern “science” became blurred as well. While the Middle Agesbegan to look more like a period of experimental science, medievalmagic appeared to continue straight into the early modern period, and231On Thorndike’s own use of “magic” and “science” as reified general categories, clearly modeledafter Tylor and Frazer, see Durand, “Magic and Experimental Science,”698–699(with reference toThorndike,History,vol.v,12–13). Interestingly, both Riess and Sarton criticized him for includingalchemy and astrology under the general “magic” umbrella (Riess, review of Lynn Thorndike,210;Sarton, review of Lynn Thorndike [1924],85).232See above,Chapter3,n.126.233Sarton, review of Lynn Thorndike (1924),84(ibid.: “the beautiful garden of ancient thought wasgradually overrun with superstitions”)."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The return of the historians321even many of the great “heroes” of scientific progress were considerablyindebted to it.234Contrary to Sarton, Thorndike was thinking not as a partisan of mod-ern science, but as an intellectual historian interested in contextualityand complexity.235His job, as he saw it, was not that of protecting theproject of modernity and progress against the perceived specter of irra-tionalism or superstition, or engaging in “hero worship or debunking,”236but simply that of trying to describe and interpret the past as faithfully aspossible:Frankly, it is not for this contribution towards modernity that we most prize thesewritings of two remote centuries which we have been at some pains to decipherand to set forth.

Thorndike emphasized the inherent conservatism of human thought: “Eventhe most intellectual men seem to have a limited number of ideas, just as humanity has a limitednumber of domesticated animals. Not only is man unable by taking thought to add one cubitto his stature, he usually equally fails to add one new idea to humanity’s small collection. Oftenmen seem to be repeating ideas like parrots.” Sarton responded by presenting history of scienceas a “heroic and stupendous tale” full of “victories and conquests; permanent conquests over thechaos; a growing light eating up the darkness . . . Men of letters have no conception of this; intheir little world, indeed, the number of ideas is limited, and every one of them has long beendomesticated . . . ”236Thorndike, “Whatever Was,WasRight,”268.237Thorndike,History,vol.iv,615.238Durand, “Magic and Experimental Science,”712.239Sarton, review of Lynn Thorndike (1924),84."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"322The truth of historyconcern, like Peuckert’s, was with the complete biosystem in its full diver-sity.

Yates in the1960sand1970s, such interpretations were no longer possible. What provoked tra-ditional historians of science, and fascinated the general public, was thatshe boldly entertained the very ideas that Sarton had already feared as animplication of Thorndike’s historiography: “that the magician...was theancestor of the modern investigator; that reason is the fruit of unreason;and truth, of superstition and occultism.”241Contrary to Thorndike, Yateswas quite traditional in pitting the Middle Ages as a period of darknessand stagnation against the Renaissance as an age of light and progressthat led the way towards the momentous rise of “genuine science” in theseventeenth century.242However, instead of simply associating the formerperiod with magic and the latter with reason and science, she made thesurprising move of applying the contrastto magic itself: far from beingstatic and “resistant to change,” magic was capable of creative renewal andreform, and Yates even went as far as to suggest that it might be the realkey to the phenomenon of the Italian Renaissance as such.243The resultwas a strikingly new perspective that placed the “old dirty magic” of theMiddle Ages against the new, beautiful, elegant magic of Italian humanistslike Ficino and Pico della Mirandola:How remote is the gibberish of [the] demonic invocation to Sol inPicatrixfromFicino and his “natural” planetary songs!

Likeall representatives of her generation, Yates was still far from immune totraditional Enlightenment notions of “magic” versus “genuine science” asgeneral reified categories, and the closely related idea of “survivals”; but, justas in Thorndike’s case, her approach in fact undermined these concepts.As formulated by Margaret Jacob and Edward Gosselin on the occasion ofYates’ death, the true reason why her work made such an impact is thatit “destroyed whole categories of analysis” that were “once held by somehistorians of science with such complacency,” and “in the process forceda rewriting...of the standard accounts of the origins of early modernscience.”245The woman who accomplished this revolution was born in a typical lateVictorian family in1899,246and went on to study French at the Univer-sity of London, where she earned her M.A. degree in1926. After this, she“missed the career bus”247and embarked on many years in virtual academicisolation, pursuing research as a private scholar while continuing to livewith her parents and sisters. As regards her central interests, Frances Yateswas essentially self-educated, and this helps explain her remarkable inde-pendence of mind, her willingness to explore unconventional pathways ofresearch, and her lifelong refusal to be intimidated by established disci-plinary boundaries.248Her first monograph,John Florio(1934), was readby Fritz Saxl and Edgar Wind, who invited her in1936to use the libraryof the Warburg Institute, then still unknown to her.249This library hadbeen founded in Hamburg by the art historian Aby Warburg, and trans-formed into a semi-public research institute during the1920s.

Most members of the Warburg circle were Jews who had to fleefrom Germany in1933, and the library itself was moved to England at thesame time, where it became the center of an independent research insti-tute affiliated to the University of London.251Frances Yates began workingthere from1936on, and was offered a position by Fritz Saxl in1941.Yateslater claimed to have learned the Warburg approach from Jean Seznec’sLa survivance des dieux antiques(1940),252and it proved a natural fit. Forher, the new “Warburgian history” meant “history in the round, ency-clopedic history, the history of symbolism and imagery integrated withgeneral history,”253but such a degree of interdisciplinarity was still veryuncommon at the time. It is illustrative, for example, that when Yatesdecided to use slides in a lecture in1945about English literature, it “fellabsolutely flat” because “it was an absolutely unheard-of thing in thosedays to use pictures in connection with a talk on poetry (poetic imageryhaving then absolutely no connection with pictures in the minds of theliterary).”254Frances Yates’ fame rests upon herGiordano Bruno and the HermeticTradition(1964) and a further series of influential monographs that fol-lowed in its wake, notablyThe Art of Memory(1966),The RosicrucianEnlightenment(1972), andThe Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age(1979). This remarkable burst of scholarly creativity at a late stage of hercareer had its origin in1961, when she was working on Giulio Camillo’sL’idea del theatro. Yates had been fascinated by Giordano Bruno’sCena dele cenerisince the mid-1930s,butalwaysfeltthat“somemajorcluewasmissing.”255As shown by her unpublished diaries, the answer came to herlike a sudden revelation, while she was working on Camillo: “In doingthis saw that Hermeticism is clue to Bruno.

Most of all, however, this passionate historian whoseemed to have burst on the scene almost out of nowhere at the age ofsixty-five, “seemingly exploding with brain-power, ideas, and hairpins,”258was challenging some of the most basic assumptions of mainstream scienceand scholarship,andhappened to do so at the very moment when thescientific establishment and its basic values were coming under attack fromthe rebellious generation of the1960s. Yates’ book hit theZeitgeistat exactlythe right moment, and continued to ride the wave of countercultural dissentwithin the academy and outside it.259Most of the critical debate about Frances Yates’ oeuvre has taken placein the fields of history and philosophy of science, and focused on her ideasabout the relation between hermeticism and the scientific revolution asexpressed with particular clarity in an article published by her in1967.260A first source of worry for many scholars was Yates’ suggestion that sincehermeticism had played an important role in the scientific revolution,hermetic “magic and superstition” henceforth had to be taken seriouslyas objects of research in the history of science. We have seen that thisimplication had already been a source of deep worry for Sarton in hisreview of Thorndike; and since the1960s it became a major issue not onlydue to Frances Yates’ work, but also because it was becoming impossibleto ignore the importance of “hermetic” currents such as theprisca theologiaand alchemy in the oeuvre of Isaac Newton.261Responding to Yates in1970,257Ibid.258Sydney Anglo at Yates’ memorial service ( Jones,Frances Yates,107).259See analysis in Hanegraaff, “Beyond the Yates Paradigm”; and note how frequently participantsin the debate about magic and hermeticism in this period mention how “the values of science”are presently “under attack from sections of the rebellious young” (for example Rattansi, “SomeEvaluations,”149; Rossi, “Hermeticism, Rationality,”266; cf. above,Chapter3,n.120for the caseof Wayne Shumaker).260Yates, “The Hermetic Tradition in Renaissance Science.”261Pioneering publications in this regard were McGuire and Rattansi, “Newton and the ‘Pipes of Pan’,”and Dobbs,Foundations of Newton’s Alchemy. How emotional an issue this was for historians ofscience at the time may be gauged from a memory fragment of Margaret Jacob: “I was in theaudience in the1970s when Richard Westfall, speaking at one of the big international congressesin the history of science, presented his early work on Newton’s alchemy.

Westman claimedthat Yates had advanced a “thesis” about how magical interpretations ofthe Copernican cosmos had prepared the way for the mathematization andmechanization of that cosmos during the seventeenth century, and pro-ceeded to deconstruct it in great detail.263His argument came in for sharpcriticism,264but succeeded in popularizing the notion of a “Yates thesis,”now understood much more broadly as the claim that “hermeticism” hadbeen a significant or even crucial influence on the scientific revolution.It is doubtful, to say the least, whether Yates ever intended to presentany such “thesis”;265but the beneficial effect was that, under the generalalthough vague umbrella of “hermeticism,” historians of science did beginto pay serious attention to the role of natural magic, astrology, alchemy,these manuscripts,’ or words to that effect” (Jacob, “Introduction,” x). Significantly, even in hismonumental Newton biography of1980, this great scholar still felt he needed to defend himself fordoing his job as a historian: “I am not an alchemist, nor do I believe in its premises . . . Nevertheless,I have undertaken to write a biography of Newton, and my personal preferences cannot makemore than a million words he wrote in the study of alchemy disappear” (Westfall,Never at Rest,21n.12).262Hesse, “Hermeticism and Historiography,” here135.

As noted by Floris Cohen, precisely the typicalEnlightenment idea that “there is something perennial to science” was criticized as unhistorical bythose who explored the hermeticist approach (The Scientific Revolution,176).263Westman, “Magical Reform” (formulation of the “Yates thesis” on p.8).264Schmitt, “Reappraisals”; Copenhaver, “Essay Review”; Rattansi, review of Westman and McGuire.265Schmitt, “Reappraisals,”202; Copenhaver, “Natural Magic,”290n.3; Rattansi, review of Westmanand McGuire,393.

As this trend devel-oped from the1970s on, simplistic notions of a causal relation between“magic” and “science” were gradually discarded in favor of more subtlehistorical/contextualist perspectives on early modern science. As an ulti-mate outcome of this development, it has now become quite normal andaccepted for historians of science to discuss topics like alchemy, astrology,and natural magic.For our specific concerns, by far the most important aspect of Yates’mature oeuvre is her basic claim that such a thing as “the Hermetic Tradi-tion” had existed in the first place, and that “hermeticism” was an importantbut neglected dimension of early modern intellectual and cultural history.Not only did Yates “destroy whole categories of analysis,” then, but shecreated new ones as well. What made her books so exciting was the startlingrevelation that at the very origins of the modern world, a large and multi-faceted, vibrant and fascinating intellectual tradition had once flourished –and that somehow, even its very existence had been entirely overlooked,forgotten, or suppressed. Yates introduced her readers to “hermeticism” asa cultural and intellectual universe all of its own, parallel to but differ-ent from the well-known worlds of established theology and Christianity,rationality and science: a universe with its own laws and dynamics, its ownintellectual giants and lesser figures, its own intellectual roots and tradi-tions, its own victories and tragedies – in short, with a history all of its own.Moreover, the worldview and aspirations of this rediscovered “HermeticTradition” resonated powerfully with a whole range of concerns that werecentral to theZeitgeistof the1960sand1970s. As presented by FrancesYates, it was a tradition dominated by magic, personal religious experience,and the powers of the imagination; it promoted a world-affirming mys-ticism consonant with an “enchanted” and holistic science that looked atnature as a living, organic whole, permeated by invisible forces and ener-gies; and it reflected a confident, optimistic, forward-looking perspectivethat emphasized humanity’s potential to operate on the world and create abetter, more harmonious, more beautiful society.All of this made “the Hermetic Tradition” look like a kind of traditionalcounterculture, inspired by beliefs and aspirations that seemed very simi-lar to those that animated the post-World War II generation in its revoltagainst established science and religion.266But Yates’ story was also a tragic266See Hanegraaff, “Beyond the Yates Paradigm.” The prominence of all these elements in what maybroadly be called the countercultural milieus of the1960sand1970s, often rooted in the1950s,is too well known to require extensive documentation.

At the dawn of modernity, so they understood, the magicaland enchanted worldview of the Renaissance had lost the battle againstthe Christian and scientific establishment, after which the very memory ofits existence had been suppressed and almost deleted, and its representa-tives and their ideas had been dismissed and ridiculed as obscurantists andfools. It was only now, after several centuries of oblivion and neglect by theintellectual and academic establishment, that the forgotten countercultureof the West had been rediscovered at last, thanks to the researches of anacademic outsider. The message was clear: Yates’ master-narrative appearedto expose mainstream accounts of science and progress as ideological con-structs by means of which the establishment had attempted, and was stillattempting, to suppress and silence its rivals. For many of Yates’ readers,moreover, the step from rediscovery to restoration was easy to make: thehermeticists of the seventeenth century might have lost the battle againstestablishment religion and science, but perhaps their contemporary heirscould get it right! If the new generation was calling for a “re-enchantmentof the world,” then Frances Yates’ Hermetic Tradition provided an excellentmodel.But did that tradition ever exist? Or, more precisely: did it exist in themanner that Yates believed it did? To answer these questions, we first needto look at her chief sources of inspiration. As far as academic research is con-cerned, the emergence of the idea of a “Hermetic Tradition” can be tracedSpiritual Marketplace; Ellwood,Sixties Spiritual Awakening; Sounes,Seventies. Classic manifestoesof the counterculture are Roszak,Making of a Counter Culture,andWhere the Wasteland Ends.267Cohen,Scientific Revolution,171; Trapp, “Introduction,” xxi (“a preoccupation, which wasto become almost her trademark, with great possibilities denied”); Jones,Frances Yates,101–102,117.268Yates’ idea that the reign of Elizabeth and Frederick V was a “hermetic golden age” was central toher much-criticizedRosicrucian Enlightenment(here xiii; cf. the review by Vickers, “Frances Yatesand the Writing of History”). For the strong claim that Casaubon’s dating of the Hermetica speltthe end of the Hermetic Tradition, because it “shattered at one blow the build-up of RenaissanceNeoplatonism,” leading to a sharp distinction between a “pre-Casaubon era” and a “post-Casaubonera,” see Yates,Giordano Bruno, chapter21,here398. The centrality of Casaubon’s dating hasbeen much relativized in recent research (Mulsow,Das Ende des Hermetismus, and summary inHanegraaff, review of Mulsow), and in1967, Yates herself already accepted Allen Debus’ argumentthat the “real collapse of Renaissance magical science” occurred only in the period after1660(Debus, review of Yates,391; Yates, “Hermetic Tradition,”272)."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"The return of the historians329very precisely to the year1938, when the great Renaissance scholar PaulOskar Kristeller published a ground-breaking article in Italian (and nevertranslated) on Marsilio Ficino and Lodovico Lazzarelli.269While workingon his two-volumeSupplementum Ficinianumin the Italian libraries andarchives,270Kristeller had come to the realization that the great importanceof theCorpus Hermeticumto Marsilio Ficino and to Renaissance culture ingeneral had been sorely neglected by historians.271He therefore exhortedhis colleagues that the history of the reception of the hermetic writingsshould urgently be put on the agenda of Renaissance research and, in sodoing, laid the foundations for the academic recovery of the “HermeticTradition.” In1955, this led to a pioneering edition titledTesti Umanisticisu l’Ermetismo, with texts by Lazzarelli, Giorgio da Veneto and Agrippa;272and the truth is that by the time that Frances Yates published her bookon Bruno in1964, the general story of Renaissance hermetism that shetold through its first ten chapters was already a familiar one among Italianspecialists. As concluded by Hilary Gatti, what made her book “in someway canonical for the English-speaking world” was therefore not so muchthe originality of this story as the “remarkable stylistictour the force”bywhich she succeeded in making it available “in a language that avoidedthe dryness and tedium of so much academic prose.”273Moreover, notjust the basic story of the rediscovery, translation, and reception of theCorpus Hermeticumwas derived straight from available scholarship, mostof it Italian, but the same was true of Yates’ understanding of Renaissancemagic, its relation to hermetism, and its significance for “man the opera-tor.” In the1955volume just quoted, Eugenio Garin already highlightedthe basic elements that were to become central to Yates’ grand narrative;274and in two important essays from1950, we find the entire magical uni-verse to which his English colleague introduced her readers fourteen years269Kristeller, “Marsilio Ficino e Lodovico Lazzarelli.” On Kristeller’s importance to the study ofRenaissance hermetism, see Celenza, “Paul Oskar Kristeller and the Hermetic Tradition.”270Kristeller,Supplementum Ficinianum; and see Kristeller and King, “Iter Kristellerianum.”271For the bibliographical material central to Kristeller’s discovery, seeSupplementum Ficinianum,vol.ii, lvii–lviii, cxxix–cxxxi.272Garin, Brini, Vasoli, and Zambelli,Testi Umanistici su l’Ermetismo.273Gatti, “Frances Yates’s Hermetic Renaissance,”196.274See Hanegraaff, “Lodovico Lazzarelli and the Hermetic Christ,”6(with quotation in Englishtranslation from Garin, “Note sull’ermetismo del Rinascimento,”12).

Although he recognized thedifferences between the “philosophical” and “technical” Hermetica, Garinsaw them as sharing the same animated universe in which all things wereinterconnected by means of correspondences:During the Quattrocento, the new image of man was gradually outlined andacquired its characteristic dimensions under the sign of Hermes Trismegistus.It came to be modeled along the lines that had already been established in thehermetic books. Now, if one may draw a clear distinction between thePimander,theAsclepius, and the theological writings on the one hand, and the innumerablemagical-alchemical treatises on the other, one still must not forget the subtleand profound subterranean connection that unites the former to the occultist,astrological, and alchemical tradition of the latter. The link consists in the idea ofa universe that is wholly alive, wholly made of secret correspondences, of occultsympathies, where the spirit is blowing everywhere, where signs with a hiddensignificance are interwoven everywhere. A universe where every thing, every being,every force is like a voice yet to be understood, a word suspended in the air; whereevery word that is pronounced has innumerable echoes and resonances; where thestars are looking, listening, and exchanging signs among themselves the way we doourselves. A universe, finally, that is an immense dialogue; one with diverse andmultiple forms, sometimes murmuring, sometimes speaking loudly, sometimesconfidentially and obscurely, sometimes in clear language. And in the middle ofit stands man: an admirable and changeable being, capable of speaking any word,of remaking all things, writing in all languages, responding to all requests, andinvoking all the gods.276Frances Yates must have been aware of how much she owed to Garin: infact, her diaries show that whenGiordano Bruno and the Hermetic Traditionappeared in1964, he was the recipient of the first copy.277This makes it allthe more interesting to observe Garin’s deep irritation twelve years later,275As already noted by Rossi, “Hermeticism, Rationality and the Scientific Revolution,”256.Thetwo essays were Garin’s “Considerazioni sulla Magia” and “Magia e Astrologia nel Pensiero delRinascimento,” later included in hisMedioevo e Rinascimento.Tothisformativeinfluence,wemustcertainly add D. P. Walker’sSpiritual and Demonic Magic, published in1958.276Garin,Medioevo e rinascimento,154. The final sentence obviously refers to Pico della Mirandola’sOratio, which emphasizes man’s unique status as a “creature of indeterminate nature” placed byGod “in the middle of the world,” and to Pico’s famous quotation fromAsclepius6, which speaks ofman as a “great miracle” placed “in the happier state of a middle status.” These elements are centralto Yates’ work as well. For a sharp criticism of Garin’s interpretation, which “miscast GiovanniPico, an ascetic Christian mystic, as the herald of human freedom and dignity,” see Copenhaver, “AGrand End for a Grand Narrative,”218(and cf. Copenhaver, “Studied as an Oration”). Accordingto Copenhaver, this understanding of Pico became the “canonical” one after World War II but isbased upon neo-Kantian projections and entirely mistaken.277Gatti, “Frances Yates’s Hermetic Renaissance,”204.ForMarch18,1960, the year before herbreakthrough discovery, Yates’ diary says “Garin – Lunch,” without further comment (ibid.,202)."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"The return of the historians331about how the concept of “the Hermetic Tradition” had become reified inthe meantime, taking on a life of its own among legions of scholars whoknew little or nothing about it:To the debate on Renaissance -isms(platonism, aristotelianism, neoplatonism,etc.), especially after Frances A. Yates’ provocative books, a new personality hasbeen added: hermetism. But unfortunately, the discussion, as far as this newelement is concerned, appears not always to be conducted with the rigor that theproblem of the origins of modern thought would require . . . In all these [i.e. Yates’]works the notion of “Hermetic Tradition” tends to be broadened enormously, tothe extent of becoming both all-encompassing and elusive.278Although Garin had planted the seeds of this phenomenon himself, hewas right to call for caution and emphasize the need for terminologicalprecision. In the light of recent scholarship, Frances Yates’ “grand narrative”of the Hermetic Tradition turns out to be extremely problematic, for atleast two interconnected reasons that must be briefly outlined here.First of all, we have seen that Hermes Trismegistus was only one amonga whole series of oriental sages who were important within the ancientwisdom discourse of the Renaissance. If one were to name the variousancient wisdom narratives after the wise man who was believed to be attheir origin, then Plethon and Ficino were clearly defending not a Hermeticbut a “Zoroastrian” Tradition, and Pico a “Mosaic” one.279Only LodovicoLazzarelli believed in a specifically “Hermetic” Tradition, and this fact hadbeen recognized by Italian scholarship from the beginning. However, in abizarre turn away from the existing academic consensus and sheer textualevidence, Yates chose to marginalize precisely this purest available exampleof a Renaissance Hermetist, because he did not fit her narrative.280In278Garin, “Divagazioni ermetiche,”462–463. In the rest of the article, see the critical discussions, fullof irritation about scholars who do not know what they are talking about, of Richard Westfall,Mary Hesse, Jean Zafiropulo and Catherine Monod, and Thomas Kuhn.279This “Zoroastrian Tradition” has in fact been traced in consummate detail by Stausberg,FaszinationZarathushtra. My discussion inChapter1implies that Christian kabbalah was in fact equivalentto the parallel notion of a “Mosaic Tradition” within the broader ancient wisdom narrative of theRenaissance.280Lazzarelli and his spiritual master Giovanni “Mercurio” da Correggio, who saw himself as the“Hermetic Christ,” were central to Kristeller’s pioneering Italian publications (“Marsilio Ficinoe Lodovico Lazzarelli”; “Ancora per Giovanni Mercurio da Correggio”; “Lodovico Lazzarelli eGiovanni da Correggio”), and Lazzarelli was the first and most important of the three authorsselected for the1955volumeTesti umanistici su l’Ermetismo. In sharp contrast, Yates called Lazzarelli“a most ardent Hermetist” and “a most enthusiastic and exaggerated Hermetist” but devoted justone long footnote to him and Correggio (Giordano Bruno,50and171with n.2). As I have suggestedelsewhere (Hanegraaff, “Lodovico Lazzarelli and the Hermetic Christ,” esp.2–8,101–104;“Lafinde la tradition herm ́etique”), Yates must have realized that the case of Lazzarelli messed up hernarrative of what “hermeticism” should be: hermetic as he might be, his work had nothing to do"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"332The truth of historymarked contrast to Lazzarelli (and, as I would argue, Agrippa: anotherbˆetenoirefor Yates),281none of Yates’ heroes can reasonably be called Hermetists:contrary to common assumptions, Ficino did not place Hermes at thecenter even in the famous preface to hisPimander, Pico saw him as onlyone of the ancient sages after Moses, and even Bruno just occasionallyrefers to him.282In short: Yates wrote the real hermetists out of her story,and replaced them by a set of more famous protagonists who hardly fitthe description. These facts lead to an unavoidable conclusion: while thehistory of the reception of the Hermetica in the Renaissance remains asimportant as ever, Frances Yates’ concept of a “Hermetic Tradition” issimply impossible to uphold.283As I have argued inChapter1, “PlatonicOrientalism” would be a much more adequate umbrella for the generalphenomenon to which she rightly called attention, and of which hermetismis only a part.Second, there is Yates’ ruling idea of a close connection between her-meticism and magic. Renaissance hermeticism was presented by her asbeginning with Ficino’s translation of theCorpus Hermeticumand receiv-ing the lethal blow with Casaubon’s refutation of its great antiquity; andshe interpreted it as essentially a magical tradition that stimulated man tooperate on the world. However, there is a fatal flaw to the argument: it justso happens that theCorpus Hermeticumcontains virtually nothing that,by any definition, could be construed as “magic!”284The optical illusionwith astral magic (contraWalker,Spiritual and Demonic Magic,64–72; see Hanegraaff, “LodovicoLazzarelli,”45n.143,84–86,94,102) but amounted to an ascetic Christian mysticism that aimedat transcending nature rather than “operating” on it. The notorious “god-making passages” of theAsclepiuson which Yates built most of her narrative (see n.285, below) were central to Lazzarelli aswell; but he interpreted them allegorically as referring to the ability of spiritually regenerated manto literally participate in God’s creative powers.281On the centrality of Lazzarelli’s understanding of hermetism to Agrippa’s worldview, see Hanegraaff,“Better than Magic.” Yates realized that she could not ignore Agrippa in a book on Renaissancemagic, but although she devoted a whole chapter to him, she did so with obvious distaste (seeabove, n.244).282Bruno,Spaccio della bestia trionfante, dialogue3;cf.Yates,Giordano Bruno, chapter12.283I suggest that the broad but vague category of “hermeticism” should better be discarded along withthat of “the Hermetic Tradition,” in favor of the relatively restricted but much more precise categoryof “hermetism,” understood as referring strictly to the ensemble of the late antique Hermeticaand the literature inspired by them during the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and later periods.The term “hermetism” should thus be used strictly for the reception history of the Hermetica(Hanegraaff, “Lodovico Lazzarelli and the Hermetic Christ,”2n.1; cf. Faivre, “Questions ofTerminology”). I have tacitly been using this terminological distinction already in my discussionsabove.284For what fifteenth-century readers could and could not find in Ficino’sPimander, see Hanegraaff,“How Hermetic was Renaissance Hermetism?” How easily historians of science accepted Yates’assumptions without bothering to check the evidence at first hand is shown, for example, by thecase of Westman, “Magical Reform,”7: Yates “has provided one element that was generally lacking"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"The return of the historians333according to which Ficino’sPimandernevertheless laid the foundations fora magical discourse was largely created by Yates’ considerable rhetoricalskills: if one studiesGiordano Bruno and the Hermetic Traditioncarefully,one discovers that in her efforts to explain the revival of magic as a revivalof hermetism, she was systematically referring not to Ficino’sPimanderbut to theAsclepius. More particularly, within that relatively lengthy trea-tise, she strategically highlighted only a few – admittedly notorious –idolatrous passages that, along with the rest of theAsclepius, had beenknown in Latin throughout the Middle Ages and could hardly be calledgreat news for intellectuals in the second half of the fifteenth century.285Insum, the “magical” dimension of hermetism was not new in the Renais-sance; and what was new (theCorpus Hermeticum) was not “magical.”Again, the conclusion would seem to be unavoidable: while Renaissancemagic is a real and obviously important historical phenomenon, it makesno sense to label it specifically “hermetic” or connect it to the impact ofFicino’sPimander.Regretfully, then, we must say goodbye to the grand narrative of “theHermetic Tradition” created by Frances Yates. It must be emphasized thatall the elements that she managed to place back on the agenda of inter-national scholarship were important indeed and remain of the greatestinterest to historians: this is true of topics such as Ficino’s translation of theCorpus Hermeticumand its reception, the importance of astral magic inthe Renaissance, the cultural significance of the dating of theHermetica,the importance of mnemonics as an intellectual tradition, the phenomenonof Christian kabbalah andocculta philosophia, John Dee and his impact inin earlier studies of Renaissance magic and science, namely a concretetextuallocus to which mightbe referred an explanation of the changed view of the Renaissance towards man and nature. Thistextual corpus was the collection of occult works [i.e. theCorpus Hermeticum].” One can onlyconclude that Westman had not actually looked at this “concrete textual locus” but took Yates ather word.285At her very first mention of the text, Yates puts the reader on the wrong foot by stating that “theAsclepiuspurports to describe the religion of the Egyptians, and by what magic rites and processesthe Egyptians drew down the powers of the cosmos into the statues of their gods” (Giordano Bruno,3), whereas this description fits onlyAscl.23–24/37–38. How strongly these short passages cameto dominate her idea of the Hermetic Tradition as a whole becomes clear if one simply countsher references to the Hermetica. C.H.ii–xviiiare quoted or discussed only rarely, with a slightprominence given to treatisesx–xiii(no references at all tovii–viii, xiv, xvii–xviii). Only C.H.iis quoted regularly (I counted twenty-four text references, most of them inChapter3,andthreeinfootnotes). ThePicatrixis mentioned twenty-three times in the text, seventeen times in footnotes;but theAsclepiusappears no fewer than eighty times in the text, twenty-nine times in footnotes.Moreover from these text references to theAsclepius, at least forty-five are about the idolatrouspassages inAscl.23–24/37–38(and the number will expand considerably if one adds the manyreferences to “godmaking,” “idolatry,” or “bad magic” that do not mention the treatise by name),next to seven about the “magnum miraculum” sentence famously quoted by Pico."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"334The truth of historyElizabethan England, the Rosicrucian phenomenon, and so on. But Yates’terminology, her general framework of interpretation, and its underlyingassumptions simply fail to do justice to the true complexity of the sources,and create a misleading picture of the field as a whole. Among the mostimportant of these problematic aspects are the opposition of Middle Agesversus Renaissance as darkness and stagnation versus light and progress,the reification of “hermeticism” as a quasi-autonomous or independenttradition opposed to an ascetic and world-denying Christian orthodoxy,the essentially “magical” nature of this entire Hermetic Tradition, its dom-inant focus on “man the operator,” its basic cast of characters, its centralimportance to Giordano Bruno and early modern science, and its essentialoptimism, progressiveness, or “modernity.”As I hope to have shown, all these various problematic areas in Yates’“grand narrative” follow from how she looked at two central concepts inRenaissance culture: that of an ancient wisdom tradition, and that of magic.Interestingly, these are precisely the topics about which her close colleagueand intimate friend Daniel P. Walker wrote his two major monographs:Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino to Campanella(1958)andTheAncient Theology(1972). Walker was a more careful scholar than Yates,but did not have her literary flair and large vision, and never achievedthe fame that she came to enjoy late in life. As a result, his works remainindispensable as classics in their field, but his formidable female counterpartsucceeded in a way that he could not: to her lasting credit, she found away of breaking through the barriers of academic resistance and rejection,thereby making it possible for an entire neglected field of research toreturn to the arena of scholarship. From the1960s through the1980s,“hermeticism” was the magic word that allowed academics to be takenseriously while exploring the “waste-basket of historiography.” It is onlyduring the1990s that this terminology slowly began to give way to a newone, that of “Western esotericism,” along with the emergence of a newresearch paradigm pioneered by the French scholar Antoine Faivre.antoine faivre and western esotericismThe adjective “esoteric” made its first appearance in Lucian of Samosata’ssatireVitarum Rustio26(second century). It was picked up by patris-tic authorities such as Clement of Alexandria, Hippolyte of Rome, Ori-gen, and Gregory of Nyssa, and generally came to refer to secret teach-ings reserved for a mystical elite, as exemplified by the Pythagorean"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Antoine Faivre and Western esotericism335brotherhoods in particular.286The substantives “esotericist” and “eso-tericism” appear to be of much more recent origin. In hisRevision derPhilosophie, published anonymously in1772, the German philosopher andhistorian Christoph Meiners drew a distinction between “exoteric” and“esoteric” philosophy, referring to practitioners of the latter asEsoteriker(esotericists); and in a critical footnote to Meiners’ work in Johann Gott-fried Eichhorn’sUrgeschichte(1792), Johann Philipp Gabler coined thenovel substantiveEsoterik(esotericism).287Interestingly, Meiners and Eich-horn were far from believing that the ancient Pythagorean brotherhoodshad been concerned with an “enthusiastic” or mystical doctrine derivedfrom Egypt: rather, they imagined their ancient “esotericists” as rational-ists and freethinkers with a Republican program, similar to enlightenedFreemasons and Weishaupt’s Illuminaten, who had kept their beliefs secretout of sheer political necessity.288It was Gabler who objected that “imita-tion of the Egyptian and Greek mysteries” had, after all, played a role in the“esotericism” of the ancient Pythagoreans, and this is how the substantivecame to be understood in Jacques Matter’sHistoire critique du gnosticismeof1828.289The Elsassian scholar Jacques Matter (1791–1864) held professorshipsin history, philosophy, and religion at the University of Strasbourg, andmarried a granddaughter of the important Christian theosopher Fr ́ed ́eric-Rodolphe Saltzmann. Clearly representative of the illuminist milieu duringthe Romantic era, he published general works on the history of Christianityand mysticism as well as monographs on Saint-Martin and Swedenborg.290In his important book of1828, he used “gnosticism” and “gnosis” as mutu-ally interchangeable terms for “the introduction into Christianity of allthe cosmological and theosophical speculations that had formed the mostimportant part of the ancient religions of the Orient, and which the newplatonists had adopted in the Occident as well.”291In other words, Matter286Hanegraaff, “Esotericism,”336; and see exhaustive documentation in Riffard,L’ ́esot ́erisme,63–88.287[Meiners],Revision,131–132; Eichhorn,Urgeschichte,vol.ii:1,326–327n.146.

In view of the later career of “esotericism” asa scholarly term, it is significant that, in fact, Matter’s description of itsbasic worldview might as well have been taken straight from the writings ofMartines de Pasqually, the foundational author of the “martinist” currentof theosophical illuminism to which Matter himself was affiliated:The emanation of all spiritual beings out of God, the progressive degenera-tion of these emanations, redemption and return to the purity of the Cre-ator, re-establishment of the original harmony of all beings, the felicitous andtruly divine life of all in God himself: those are the fundamental teachings ofgnosticism...Behold,ittellsyou,here,thelightthatemanatesfromanimmensesource of light, that spreads its beneficent rays everywhere: this is how all thepure spirits emanate from the divine light. Behold, again, it cries out, how all thesources that feed the earth, that beautify it, that fertilize and purify it, emanatefrom one single and immense ocean: this is how, from the center of divinity,emanate so manyrivers(geniipure like watery crystal) which shape and fill theworld of intelligences.

It should be noted, however,that, technically at least, “esotericism” had not yet become a synonym for it:in Matter’s work, the term still referred to secret teachings concerned withsuperior knowledge, reserved for an elite and passed on from the ancientmystery traditions, or the “inner” dimensions of religion as opposed tomere external doctrine and religious observance. For the basic worldviewin question, or the various currents that represented it, it was rather theterm “gnosis” that was now beginning to gain some currency.293In a large292Matter,Histoire critique,18–20(and cf. again the1843edition: Hanegraaff, “Birth of Esotericism,”201).

Baur’s book did much to popular-ize the concept of “gnosis” as a general, quasi-historiographical category,but while this notion can be traced through many esoteric or esotericiz-ing authors through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, its impact onacademic literature remained limited at least until the period after WorldWar II.295In the wake of Matter’s book, the term “esotericism” began to spreadas well, first in French and eventually crossing over to various otherlanguages.296For our concerns, the French context remains the most rel-evant by far, because it is here thatl’ ́esot ́erismeeventually mutated froma term for secrecy and concealment or interiority into a historiographi-cal concept, and came to be taken seriously by academics. Two factorsappear to have been crucial to this phenomenon: the explosion after294Baur,Christliche Gnosis, vii.295For occultist notions of gnosis, see, for example, H. P. Blavatsky,Isis Unveiled,vol.ii,38:“theGnosis, based on the secret science of sciences . . . was never without its representatives in any age orcountry” (i.e. Zoroaster, Abraham, Henoch, Moses, the three Hermeses Trismegisti, Pythagoras,Plato, Jesus, Philo, and the Kabbalah). A special although isolated case is that of the Christiananarchist philosopher Eugen Heinrich Schmitt (see St ̈ockelle, “Eugen Heinrich [ Jen ̋oHenrik]Schmitt”) and his two-volume workDie Gnosis(1903), subtitled “foundations of the worldviewof a nobler culture,” which devotes one volume to the gnostics of late antiquity and then tracesa lineage up to the end of the nineteenth century in the second volume. For further twentieth-century examples, see Faivre, “Le terme et la notion de ‘gnose’.” On modern academic constructsof “gnosis” or “gnosticism” as general categories, see Hanegraaff, “Gnosticism,”794–796;andfor a criticism of Eric Voegelin’s influential theory of “gnostic politics,” see Hanegraaff, “On theConstruction,”29–36. A useful overview of the many understandings of “gnosis/gnosticism” isSloterdijk and Macho,Weltrevolution der Seele; and for the eventual degeneration of “gnosticism”into a term that seems capable of meaning “all things and their opposite,” see the apt and humorousremarks by Culianu, “Gnostic Revenge,”290.296Hanegraaff, “Esotericism,”337.

Tobegin with the first: the boom in French illuminism studies after1928was described in the following words by Mircea Eliade in a book reviewof1973:The publication of Auguste Viatte’s two-volume work,Les sources occultes duromantisme: Illuminisme-Th ́eosophie(Paris,1928), marked an important date inthe investigation of esoteric literature. It revealed an unknown or perhaps carefullyneglected dimension of the Enlightenment – the religious concern of a great sectionof European intelligentsia, considered until that time antireligious or religiouslyindifferent. Professor Viatte was the first savant to examine an immense numberof documents, mostly unpublished, buried in administrative and private archives.The sensation caused by this work among literary historians and critics as well asamong historians of ideas stimulated a number of researches on the esoteric andoccult movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.297As examples, Eliade went on to list the publications by G ́erard van Rijnberk(1935), Alice Joly (1938), Jacques Roos (1953), L ́eon Cellier (1953), LouisGuinet (1962), Robert Amadou (1962), Max Geiger (1963), Paul Arnold(1970), and the subject of his book review, Ren ́e le Forestier (posthumouslypublished by Antoine Faivre,1970).298To understand the importance, forour concerns, of this post-Viatte development of French illuminism stud-ies, we should remember that the research paradigm grounded in FrancesYates’ concept of “the Hermetic Tradition” described a domain that waslimited essentially to the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries, andthereby suggested that the triumph of modern science and rationality hadput an end to it. This made “hermeticism” a thing of the past, whichcould play no role of any real importance in the modern world. In markedcontrast, we will see that when “esotericism” began to make its entrance inthe academy by means of Faivre’s writings, it emphasized how illuminismand Christian theosophy, grounded in Renaissance “hermeticism,” had notonly survived but had flourished during the ages of the Enlightenment andRomanticism. Once it became evident how successfully these traditionalcurrents had managed to cross the epistemological barrier of the eighteenthcentury, the way was open for scholars to explore their further developmentas well. As a result, the field was eventually broadened so as to include theentire period from the Renaissance to the present day.

In fact, this is what the term wouldeventually come to mean in academic research from the1990s on. First,however, it went through a lengthy religionist phase, due to the personalesoteric commitments of a few influential francophone scholars affiliatedwith Eranos. To describe how this happened, we must now turn to thecentral protagonist of this section.Born in1934, Antoine Faivre299studied German and North Americanliterature and history of religions at the Sorbonne, where he continued topursue a doctorate in German studies. His very earliest publications weremarked by a fascination with “gothic” and fantastic literature, and in1962he published a book on vampire mythology that is now considered the firstgenuinely scholarly study of that topic.300It would appear that fantasticliterature was his point of entrance into the domain that the French calll’Imaginaire, and a love for myths, images, and symbols was to remaina constant factor in his scholarly oeuvre. The year1961was decisive forFaivre on both a personal and a professional level. Having been raised ina Roman Catholic family, he became a convinced Christian during hisarmy service in Algeria;301and around the same time, Auguste Viatte’schef d’oeuvreinspired him to specialize in the illuminist and theosophicalmilieus of eighteenth-century Germany.302Back in France, Faivre went onto earn his doctorate with two large and meticulously documented studiesof Niklaus Anton Kirchberger (1966) and Karl von Eckartshausen (1969),and detailed historical research into the primary sources of illuminism,Christian theosophy, and the closely related current of German RomanticNaturphilosophiewould remain the backbone of his voluminous oeuvrethrough the years.299Previous accounts of Faivre and his scholarship include Davis, “Hermes on the Seine”; Giegerich,“Antoine Faivre”; and, most importantly, McCalla, “Antoine Faivre and the Study of Esotericism.”I am deeply grateful to Antoine Faivre for giving me generous and unrestricted access to his privateJournal(1973–present) and his voluminous correspondence.300Faivre,Les vampires.

He might well have spent the restof his career as a specialized historian in Germanic studies, had it not beenfor a second factor: the impact on his thinking of the Eranos approach toreligion, and of Henry Corbin and Gilbert Durand in particular. In Faivre’scontribution to Corbin’sFestschriftin1977, we read the following lines:I am given the opportunity to thank a Master to whom I owe it to distinguishbetween a thriving chaff – destined, however, to be collected as well – and a goodgrain, the quality of which is overlooked by the researcher interested too exclusivelyin the diachronic history of events. About eight years ago, an article by HenryCorbin devoted to the Divine Wisdom, as well as his preface to C. G.

The latter, like theSleeping Beauty woken up from her night, is then no longer just an archeologist’sbusiness.303Characteristically combining a biblical with a fairy-tale metaphor, andwithout forgetting to point out that even the “chaff ” deserves to be col-lected, Faivre was thanking Corbin for showing him how to find truth inhistory: what might seem to be mere collections of dead facts could bebrought back to life by the scholar who understood that there was moreto reality than a mere succession of diachronic events. As will be seen,this insight derived from Corbin – and strongly supported by the leadingFrench scholar of theimaginaireGilbert Durand, whom he met aroundthe same time – marked the beginning of Faivre’s religionist period.At the same time, in1969, that Corbin’s work was opening up a newapproach to history for him, Faivre’s studies of illuminism and Christiantheosophy were crowned with the doctorate and the publication of hislarge study of Eckartshausen; and without passing through the usual loweruniversity positions, he got a full professorship at the University of Parisin the same year, followed by one at the University of Bordeaux in1972.Moreover, still in1969, he was initiated as a Freemason in theGrandLoge Nationale Franc ̧aiseand began to practice the MartinistRite EcossaisRectifi ́e(Rectified Scottish Rite), a Christian chivalric system created byJean-Baptiste Willermoz in1778.304Faivre’s studies of eighteenth-century303Faivre, “Ternaire alchimique,”613–614.

It was the brainchild of Henry Corbin, and the most explicitvehicle of his personal understanding of “esotericism.” Like most Eranosthinkers, Corbin and Faivre shared a deep interest in German intellectualculture and Romantic philosophers in particular;308and Corbin, a pupil ofAlexandre Koyr ́e, saw his own worldview as perfectly consonant with the(actually quite divergent) Christian theosophies of Jacob B ̈ohme, FriedrichChristoph Oetinger, and Emanuel Swedenborg.309Corbin’s initiation intotheRite Ecossais Rectifi ́eand its inner order, theChevaliers Bienfaisants dela Cit ́e Sainte, seems to have filled him with deep enthusiasm, as reflectedinhisgreatstudyontheImago Templidiscussed above: he was enchantedby its neo-Templar symbolism inspired by the theosophy of Martinesde Pasqually, and his understanding of neo-Templar Freemasonry, Graalmythology, the “Inner Church,” and the “Celestial Jerusalem” was pro-foundly indebted to these currents and the scholarship about them – from(Faivre,Journal,May6,1975). The young Faivre had been initiated in theOrdre Martinistein1963(Journal,April22,1975), but he began to withdraw around the time he became a Freemason.305Faivre, personal communication, July21,2010. For the remarkable story of Corbin’s masoniccareer, and the problems concerning its “regularity,” see the analysis by Clergue, “En quˆete deHenry Corbin.” As shown by this author, extraordinary measures were taken by those in Corbin’sretinue to make it possible for him to advance with record speed towards the inner order of theRite Ecossais Rectifi ́e,theChevaliers Bienfaisants de la Cit ́e Sainte.306He had been a regular visitor since1967, and was known to the audience for his German summariesof Corbin’s difficult French contributions (Hakl,Verborgene Geist,346).307See Hakl,Verborgene Geist,407–411; Eliade, “Some Notes,”172–176.308For example, Nasr, “Henry Corbin, ‘L’exil occidental’,”5;Soster,Le d ́eveloppement,chapter2.Corbin highlighted the country of “Faustian man” already in his very first published article(Accart, “Identit ́eetth ́eophanie,”180).309For Swedenborg, see Corbin’s Eranos lectures “Herm ́eneutique spirituelle compar ́ee” (1965)and“L’imago templi,”239–248.Koyr ́e is, of course, the author of a standard work on B ̈ohme (Laphilosophie de Jacob Boehme); and it was his chair at the ́Ecole Pratique des Hautes ́Etudes thatwas changed into a chair for “Christian Esotericism” in1964, at Corbin’s suggestion (see below,page348)."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"342The truth of historyArthur Edward Waite to Antoine Faivre himself.310Given the verytitle of theUniversit ́e Saint Jean de J ́erusalemand his great study of the“Image of the Temple,” it should be noted that ritual progress throughthe order of theChevaliers Bienfaisants de la Cit ́e Sainteis supposed toculminate in a vision of the celestial Jerusalem and the announcement thatthe candidate has now reached the doors of its Temple.311Spurred on by these spiritual commitments, and deeply concerned aboutthe “crisis” of contemporary intellectual life, Corbin decided (together withFaivre and a few other academics, supported by an impressive group ofinternational scholars)312to found an “international center for comparativespiritual research,” focused on the three “religions of the book” and devotedto the “restoration and revival of the traditional studies and sciences inthe occident.”313Like Eranos, this “counter-university” took the form ofan annual seminar, and the papers were published in a series ofCahiersfrom1975to1988. What makes theUniversit ́e Saint Jean de J ́erusalemunique and fascinating is that it combined academic scholarship on a highintellectual level with a very explicit profession of Christian theosophical,illuminist, and related “esoteric” beliefs.

Its task is directed towards a goal more profound than that of replac-ing the latter by other institutions . . . In saying that a spiritual oecumenicalismcannot be pursued by the exoteric path of a confrontation with the dogmas orinstitutions, one essentially bestows the meaning ofinteriorismupon the “esoteric”quest.315In other words, theUniversit ́eshould be a visible reflection of the “InnerChurch.” Corbin went on to point out that, in contrast to the great theo-logical and philosophical systems of Western culture, “the treasure of thespiritual sciences, which can be grouped under the more or less happyor adequate term ‘esotericism’” was still buried in libraries, without ade-quate institutional settings to safeguard and promote it. As a result, ithad become easy prey for ignorant “improvisers without discernment,”as shown by the current wave of “pseudo-esotericisms.”316TheUniver-sit ́e Saint Jean de J ́erusalemintended to remedy this situation by pro-viding a context where the true meaning of esotericism could be dis-cussed on a high level by competent academics. But such a project couldnot be pursued from a perspective of scholarly detachment: “the level ofspiritual reality proper to the traditional sciences remains inaccessible ifthe researcher does not himself go through a new birth.”317In its fightagainst historicism, agnosticism, and any other doctrine that sought toprohibit humanity from referring to the “beyond,” theUniversit ́eexpectedeach of its participants (speaker or listener) to be “a believer” commit-ted to “the spiritual life.”318In this connection it should be noted thatCorbin and Faivre have always seen their Christian beliefs319as perfectlycompatible with their commitment to the “Inner Church” of theosophyor the masonic chivalry and neo-Templarism of the Rectified ScottishRite.314On this affiliation, see de Chateaubriant, “L’universit ́eSaint-JeandeJ ́erusalem” (in the first issueof theCahiers).315Corbin, “L’Universit ́eSaint-JeandeJ ́erusalem,”8–9.316Ibid.,10.317Ibid.,11.318Ibid.,12. Note that Corbin himself originally conceived theUniversit ́eas a private gathering of nomore than about twenty carefully selected “esotericists in perfect spiritual accord with one another.”That it finally took a more public and academic shape was due only to the strong opposition ofFaivre, Durand, and de Chateaubriant against this idea (Faivre,Journal,March4,1974).319Corbin was raised a Catholic but had converted to Protestantism, partly under the influence ofKarl Barth’sR ̈omerbrief(on this conversion and the young Corbin’s participation in the BarthiangroupHic et Nunc, see Soster, “Le d ́eveloppement de la pens ́ee d’Henry Corbin,”chapter2)."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"344The truth of historyPrior to1969, Antoine Faivre’s references to “esotericism” were still in linewith the conventional usage of that term by French scholars in the post-Viatte tradition: it was mainly associated with the distinction of “inner”(esoteric) and “outer” (exoteric). His true concern was with defining thecategory of “illuminism,” and here he emphasized the notions of an InnerChurch, initiation, the myth of fall and reintegration, and the centralityof nature as a web of correspondences.320In his first general overviewdevoted to “Christian esotericism” from the sixteenth to the twentieth cen-tury (1972), one sees him struggling with the various connotations of theword and the difficulties of demarcating the field. His proposal (“perhapsartificial, but methodologically useful”) was to define as “esotericist” anythinker, “Christian or not,” who emphasized three points: analogical think-ing, theosophy, and the Inner Church.321Interestingly, Faivre made a pointof demarcating esotericism not only from witchcraft, but also from magic,astrology, and the mantic arts: these “occult” arts qualified as “esotericism”only insofar as they appeared in a theosophical context. While Faivre’s def-inition of theosophy itself remained a bit vague here, it was clearly centralto his understanding of “esotericism”; and his historical overview showedthat he looked at the field from a perspective dominated by the illuministcontext and its immediate roots in Paracelsianism, Christian kabbalah, andJacob B ̈ohme. At the end of the article, Henry Corbin was singled out asan essential author for understanding Christian esotericism, and it finishedwith a statement typical of the Eranos perspective:comprehending the spiritual events of esotericism is not possible without ahermeneutics that always leads back to the archetypal plane, for a meaning hasits own proper value, independently from all the explications that one can – andmust – give it; as such, this meaning should neither be reduced to one fixed literalinterpretation, nor enclosed in a history that is seen as belonging to the past.322In a slightly earlier contribution to the journalAnnales(special issue onstructuralism and historiography,1971), we find Faivre’s first attempt atputting such a program into action himself, by moving beyond strict his-toriography and towards a general philosophical hermeneutics. As couldbe expected, it showed the dominant influence of Henry Corbin, GilbertDurand, and Mircea Eliade, alongside another crucial influence on Faivre’sthinking in this period, the philosopher of non-aristotelian logic St ́ephane320Faivre,Kirchberger, xiii–xvii;Eckartshausen,13–14. The first longer discussion of “esotericism”occurs inEckartshausen,374–382, where it denotes the “interiorism” of the “Inner Church” (thehuman heart as the true temple of divinity) as opposed to the exotericism of the establishedchurches (ibid.,378–380).321Faivre, “L’ ́esot ́erisme chr ́etien,”1304–1307.322Ibid.,1360."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Antoine Faivre and Western esotericism345Lupasco.323Faivre discussed alchemical texts as reflections of an underlyingworldview, and applauded Eliade for having demonstrated that “the his-torical perspective alone, although absolutely indispensable in any seriousstudy, is powerless to give an account of certain spiritual facts.”324To t r u l yunderstand alchemy, which “‘imagines’ always in space, almost never intime,” one needed a non-aristotelian and non-Cartesian logic as developedby Lupasco and supported by modern physics.In hisL’ ́esot ́erisme au XVIIIe si`ecle(1973) this perspective was appliedto eighteenth-century esotericism as a whole. Its Introduction was basedroughly upon the article of1972, but Faivre now stated confidently that“esoteric thought appears to be of an essentially contradictorial type, thatis to say, it is made up of symbolic mechanisms that belong to the logicof contradiction.”325In line with contemporary debate about “differentrationalities,”326and referring specifically to L ́evi-Strauss, he was arguingthat esotericism must be understood in terms of the “analogical think-ing” proper to myth and symbolism, not the “aristotelian” logic proper tophilosophy and doctrinal theology. The theosophers or esotericists tendedto be badly understood because they either speak their own language,which is understood only by their peers and by poets, or try to makethemselves understood in the inadequate language of the philosophersand theologians.327Faivre tried to demarcate his own approach from twotypes of dogmatic either/or thinking, those of traditionalist esotericismand rationalist reductionism;328and presented “esotericism” as a kind ofmental space mediating between the radical “homogenizing” extremesof dualism, ecstatic mysticism, and the established churches.329In con-clusion, he emphasized that next to Eliade’s oeuvre, Corbin’s notions ofthe “imaginal” and the creative imagination and Durand’s studies of the“regimes of the imaginary” provided the key to his Introduction, andhence to his understanding of esotericism.330In Faivre’s first Eranos lec-ture, also in1973, the same set of ideas was applied to alchemy. Referring toSchelling’s notion of “tautegory” as used by Corbin, Faivre stated that thetrue meaning of alchemical images such as those in Michael Maier’sAta-lanta Fugienslies in an independent and autonomous spiritual reality that323Faivre, “Pour un approche figuratif de l’alchimie” (repr. in Faivre,Mystiques, th ́eosophes et illumin ́es,201–213); and cf. the description of Faivre’s lecture “Alchimie occidentale et logique aristot ́elicienne”inthesameyear.324Ibid.,202.325Faivre,L’ ́esot ́erisme au XVIIIe si`ecle,15,cf.19.326See above,Chapter3,pp.165–166(third approach to “magic”).327Faivre,L’ ́esot ́erisme au XVIIIe si`ecle,19.328Ibid.,26–27.329See the diagram inibid.,21.330Ibid.,28–29."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"346The truth of historycannot be deduced from their textual explanations or reduced to historicalanalyses.331One year later, in Faivre’s first contribution to theUniversit ́e Saint Jean deJ ́erusalem, we find an ambitious attempt at interpreting the general courseof Western culture in terms of a basic “divorce” between analogical thinkingand aristotelian logic since the later Middle Ages. The crucial event wasthat Aristotle’s principles of identity, non-contradiction and the excludedmiddle had come to be applied not only to the created world, where theywere indispensable to the development of science and technology, but tometaphysical reality as well. As a result, aristotelian logic turned into an“intolerant master” that excluded any other approach to reality as deficientapriori;332and as a result of this process, what we now call “esotericism”emerged as a category of exclusion:the principles of formal aristotelianism, having wrongly become the foundationaprioriof all official metaphysics in theology – and later, in secularized philosophy –have, by the same token, banished the other forms of logical (hence analogical)thinking into a no man’s land that is still imagined as if surrounded by sulphuricvapours. Piled up all together, always on the peripheries of the churches and uni-versities, and condemned perpetually to either use cunning or defend themselvesopenly, little by little these [forms of thinking] have coalesced into a strange massthat, for lack of a better term, has been calledesotericismsince about a century ago,and is still seen by many as just a cabinet of curiosities where the best rubs shoulderswith the worst. Sometimes without any transition, next to the low magic or thedelirious divination of a sorcery inherited by last century’s occultism, one discoversthere the summits of human thinking, intuitions on man and the universe thatare capable of bursting open the deadlocks in which our modern philosophershave indifferently allowed themselves to get imprisoned: one discovers theosophythere, and at the same time – which is hardly surprising – all kinds of instructivespeculation on themes that are considered “esoteric” in the Latin Occident buthave acquireddroit de cit ́eelsewhere.333Faivre’s history of the “divorce” emphasized how the repression of ana-logical thinking resulted in an artificial opposition that left room onlyfor two extremes: either an abstract idealism focused only on pure divineessences, or a concrete visible universe cut off from any spiritual real-ity (finally leading to materialism). The decisive event in this disjunc-tive process – and here Faivre depended heavily on Corbin – had been331Faivre, “Mystische Alchemie und geistige Hermeneutik,”343,355.332Faivre, “Philosophie de la nature et naturalisme scientiste,”92.Cf.97(“a science that is actually aform of superior technology had the pretension of turning itself into a metaphysics and ended upconsidering itself as the absolute norm”), and107(“epistemological totalitarianism”).333Faivre, “Philosophie de la nature et naturalisme scientiste,”92–93."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Antoine Faivre and Western esotericism347the triumph of Averroism over the thinking of Avicenna.334The destruc-tion of an organic harmony uniting God, man, and the world resultedin a continuing situation of existential malaise that remains characteris-tic of the “idealist and schizomorphous intellectualism of modernity.”335Against this dominant intellectual trend, “the analogical and theosophicaltradition” continued in Renaissance currents such as Christian kabbalahand Paracelsianism, leading finally to aNaturphilosophiethat was nowmaking its comeback in the thinking of modern physicists like WernerHeisenberg.336Faivre’s article culminated in a passionate plea for “remythologization”and revaluation of the “creative and participatory imagination,” againstcontemporary trends such as existentialist pessimism, the abstract formal-ism of structuralism, the “superstition” of materialism, and the nihilism ofan “archaeology of knowledge” that tries to convince us “that knowledgesounds hollow, man is dead, nature is meaningless, and no philosophy hasany sense.”337Here and in a few other publications around the mid-1970s,Faivre was speaking explicitly as a Christian;338and like other participantsof Eranos and (particularly) theUniversit ́e Saint Jean de J ́erusalem,hewasnow lashing out at the desacralization of the world, the reversal of valuesthat made “above” a reflection of “below” instead of the reverse, histori-cist concepts of linear causality, the blind faith in secular evolution andprogress, and so on: against all forms of “reductionism,” he was affirmingthat myth should have precedence over history, metaphysics over physics,correspondences over causality, analogical thinking over aristotelian logic,and images over concepts.339One can only conclude that at this point inhis intellectual career, Faivre was speaking as a Christian theosopher, deeplyconcerned about theUmwertung aller Wertethat had caused the crisis ofthe modern world.334Corbin,Creative Imagination,10–18.

A convenient marker in this processof transition is the year1979, when Faivre was elected to the chair for“History of Esoteric and Mystical Currents in Modern and ContemporaryEurope” at the ́Ecole Pratique des Hautes ́Etudes (Sorbonne), a highlyprestigious research institute with a strong secular focus in the Frenchtradition ofla ̈ıcit ́e.343Once again, although almost by accident, it wasHenry Corbin who had been at the origin of this unique academic position,which was to become crucial to the establishment of “Western esotericism”as an academic field of research. In1964,asoneoftheEPHE’sprofessors,Corbin had suggested the new title “History of Christian Esotericism”for a chair that had just become vacant, because it seemed to correspondmore or less to the competences of the favorite candidate, the specialistof Christian kabbalah Franc ̧ois Secret. Coming at the end of a long andexhausting faculty meeting, Corbin’s idea was accepted by his colleagues forwant of anything better.344Secret got the position in1965,butwasinfactembarrassed by the title of his chair, and never attempted to conceptualize“esotericism” (Christian or not) as a specific field of research.345At hisretirement in1979, the title of the chair was modified: it should no longer340Faivre,Journal, August29,October10,1974;seeHakl,Verborgene Geist,346.341In “Les ‘Noces Chymiques’” (1977) he restricted himself to simply pointing to “the existence of acertain type of occidental spirituality . . . generally suppressed, occulted, by the intellectual fashions,stagnations, and totalitarianisms that have hardly ceased to prevail over the last centuries” (o.c,139). The religionist message was implicit rather than explicit in “Les m ́etamorphoses d’Herm`es”(1978, the year after Corbin’s death), devoted largely to the “new physics” asNaturphilosophie,with much attention to Raymond Ruyer’s bestsellerLa Gnose de Princeton(1974). The followingfour years Faivre gave no lectures at theUniversit ́e, and when he returned in1983,itwaswithentirely historical lectures on chivalric imagery in eighteenth-century alchemy, Freemasonry, andliterature (Faivre, “Miles redivivus”) and elements of Christian theosophical thought two yearslater (“Pens ́ees de Dieu, images de l’homme”).342Faivre,Journal, August29,1974, August21,1976; Hakl,Verborgene Geist,346–348.In1975Faivreunsuccessfully tried to change the Eranos format by offering a petition signed by many long-standing participants.343Faivre, “From Paris to Amsterdam and Beyond,”123.344Faivre, personal communication, March29,2008.345Ibid.,123–124; Hanegraaff, “Birth of Esotericism,”189–201."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Antoine Faivre and Western esotericism349be limited to Christianity alone, but restricted to the European contextfrom the Renaissance to the present, and the adjective and plural “esotericcurrents” was chosen to avoid suspicions of essentialism. Furthermore, theadjective “mystical” was added so as to broaden the range of applicants,leading eventually to a job competition between Faivre and the specialistof mysticism Michel de Certeau.346Illuminism, Christian theosophy, andNaturphilosophieremained Faivre’schief domain of research in the period from1979to1992,buthewascon-cerned to situate those currents within a larger historical framework, andspent considerable effort discussing the specificity of “Western esotericism”as a field of research. Of fundamental importance in his publications dur-ing this period347remains the notion of esotericism as a worldview pittedagainst the “desacralization of the cosmos,” still understood in terms of thelate medieval triumph of Averroism and its application of aristotelian logicto the domain of metaphysics. Instead of assuming an ontological “rupture”between pure spirit and material bodies – and hence ultimately, in biblicalterms, between Creator and creation – esotericism in this understandingis predicated on the simultaneous incarnation of spirit and spiritualizationof body on an intermediary plane of reality accessible by the imagination(which, on these assumptions, is understood not as a fabricator of illusionsbut as an organ of perception). This fundamental notion was derived fromCorbin, but there always remained an unresolved tension between the lat-ter’s docetist understanding of hismundus imaginalison the one hand,and Faivre’s decidedly incarnational perspective on the other. WhereasCorbin ultimately privileged the spiritual dimension and thereby had tomake the body into an “illusion” by comparison, Faivre was more consis-tent in emphasizing the centrality of “nature” (understood very much interms of German RomanticNaturphilosophie) as a living body intermediarybetween the dead weight of pure matter and the cool abstractions of purespirit.

In the academic context to which he wasused, the term was functioning in erudite discussions on a high intellec-tual level, among sophisticated scholars and philosophers who, more thananything, shared an abhorrence of the dogmatic Marxism that had cometo dominate much of French academic life since the events of1968.Intheir fight against “historicism“ and “reductionism,” they were reactingto what was experienced as a stifling new totalitarianism that sought tosuppress freedom of thought and left no room for any religious or spiritual350Corbin misinterpreted the anti-docetic theosophies of B ̈ohme and Oetinger as docetic theosophiessimilar to Swedenborg’s: on this point, see the clash between Corbin and Ernst Benz in1975assummarized by Faivre, “La question,”96; and cf. Hanegraaff,Swedenborg, Oetinger, Kant,132–133n.116. Faivre deliberately emphasized incarnationism at theUniversit ́eSaintJeandeJ ́erusalem,and his disagreement with Corbin was well known among the participants (Faivre,Journal,July8,1975, December24,1975,July23,1976;March18,1980;June18,1986). Note that while ErikDavis (“Hermes on the Seine”) correctly recognizes the Roman Catholic subtext in Faivre’s work,he spectacularly misinterprets him as promoting an ascetic rejection of the body and sexuality.351Faivre,Acc`es(1986),14,19.352Ibid.,7.353See especiallyibid.,28–30,33–48. Faivre’s frequent references, in this period, to Tradition (capital-ized) reflect the influence of Gu ́enonian perspectives in the French intellectual milieu, but he wasat pains to demarcate his own understanding from their “severe” and “purist” views (ibid.,33–39).Rather confusingly, he referred to popular New Age perspectives as adhering to an “historical”perspective because they were exploring a multitude of “traditions” rather than the single Tradition(ibid.,36)."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Antoine Faivre and Western esotericism351values. The specter that they feared was an imminent communist takeoverreminiscent of the fascist dictatorship in recent memory.354One can there-fore imagine Faivre’s initial puzzlement in the early1980s, when a seriesof annual guest professorships at the University of Berkeley introducedhim first-hand to the phenomenon of a decidedly left-wing and liberal“esotericism” flourishing among students and professors on the AmericanWest Coast. Faivre’s unpublished diaries show how, almost immediatelyafter arrival, he found himself confronted with the vogue of “new reli-gious movements” and the alternative lifestyles nowadays associated withthe New Age – not to mention a general expectation among students andcolleagues that this European professor of “esoteric and mystical currents”would certainly know all about them! In fact, Faivre’s understanding of“esotericism” was quite far removed from that of his new American audi-ence, and adjustments proved necessary on both sides.It is no exaggeration to say that Faivre fell in love with San Francisco,and he kept returning to the Berkeley campus each year during most of the1980s. As a result of these lengthy sojourns and his many discussions withAmerican colleagues, the phenomenon of contemporary “popular” esoteri-cism became a serious topic of reflection. He began to broaden the scope ofhis research beyond the domains of Christian theosophy, illuminism andNaturphilosophie, and his studies of such topics as animal magnetism, spir-itualism, Traditionalism, or new religious movements forced him to reviseand broaden his theoretical understanding of the field. His initial approachappears to have been one of trying to educate his audience about the dif-ferences between popular and superficial forms of “New Age” esotericismand the more profound and meaningful Tradition of esotericism “prop-erly speaking,” that is to say, the core perspective represented by Christiantheosophy andNaturphilosophie.355Its ideas and traditions appeared to beutterly unknown to his students and colleagues, but could be made more354Faivre,Journal,February2, April1,November18,1974;March15and20,1977;March15,1978;January23,1980; April25,1981;February8,1982. The similarity between fascist and communisttotalitarianism was obvious both for Durand, who served in the French resistance during WorldWar II, and Faivre, whose father was likewise in the resistance and spent seven months in a Germanconcentration camp (Faivre,Journal, September26,1976).355See, for example, the many pejorative references to popular and contemporary esotericism inthe Introduction of Faivre’sAcc`es(1986) and the parallel English entry “Esotericism” in Eliade’sEncyclopedia of Religion(1987). See also Faivre’s first large article in English, “Children of Hermes”(1988), with references to, for example, “malicious writers” like Erich von D ̈aniken or the “pseudo-initiatic discourse” prominent in Californian new religious movements. On the other hand, whenthe theosophist and scholar Jean-Louis Si ́emons severely criticized an old article by Faivre on“Theosophy” (Encyclopaedia Universalis,1973), in1985, Faivre surprised him by readily admittingits weaknesses and pointing out that his opinions had evolved in the meantime (Faivre,Journal,March8,1985)."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"352The truth of historyunderstandable thanks to the main intellectual framework that they sharedwith Faivre: that of the Eranos-inspired study of religion and myth, promi-nently represented in American academic culture by such famous names asJung and Eliade, next to Joseph Campbell, James Hillman, and a range ofother authors in the same tradition. In these years, Faivre was much con-cerned with the mythical figure(s) of Hermes, “the antitotalitarian god parexcellence,”356and was vigorously defending what he now called a “hermes-ian” program of remythologization, against the reign of empty abstractionand the false “ideologies and pseudophilosophies of history.”357Nevertheless, the tension between such religionist engagement and therequirements of historiography proper became an increasingly pressingissue for Faivre during the later1980s. It would appear that this happenedmainly as a result of academic internationalization: combinations of his-torical and philosophical erudition with a spiritual message, of the kindthat he was used to in his own French context (and that also went downwell among American audiences influenced by Eliadian, Jungian, and otherEranos-inspired perspectives), appeared to be puzzling, to say the least, forspecialized American, Italian, or German historians working in the emerg-ing fields of hermeticism and alchemy,358and this eventually led him toreconsider his own approach. Furthermore, Faivre’s growing irritation withthe dogmatic antimodernism and intolerant attitudes of the “perennialists”at the annual conferences of the American Academy of Religion359wouldappear to have contributed to a renewed appreciation for the virtues ofthe French tradition ofla ̈ıcit ́eingrained in his home institution, the ́EcolePratique des Hautes ́Etudes, and the merits of secular historiography ingeneral.360The results of this process of reorientation became visible in hissmall but seminal volumeL’ ́esot ́erismeof1992.The publication of that127-page booklet, written for a famous Frenchseries of pocket introductions, marks both the end of Faivre’s religion-ist period and the beginning of the study of Western esotericism as anacademic field of research.361Written deliberately from a perspective ofdescriptive neutrality, its five main chapters were devoted to the ancient356Faivre, “Children of Hermes,”432.357Ibid.,431.InAcc`es,49, Faivre defines as “Hermesian” the “spiritual attitude common to all Westernesotericism placed under the sign of the god with the caduceus,” i.e. Hermes.

As such, it was thefirst scholarly publication of its kind that covered the entire field fromearly modernity to the present day, with due attention to its sources in an-tiquity, combining the broad scope of the generalist with an unparalleledlevel of historical expertise concerning the relevant primary sources. In hisIntroduction, moreover, Faivre confronted the considerable problems ofdefining and demarcating “esotericism” as a domain of academic research.This, too, had never been done before. He discussed the advantages anddisadvantages of various approaches and solutions, and presented his ownproposal as a “methodological tool susceptible of being completed andcorrected” by future research.362The heart of his Introduction consistedof a soon-to-be-famous definition of esotericism as a “form of thought”that can be recognized by the presence of four intrinsic characteristics (cor-respondences; living nature; imagination/mediations; transmutation) andthe possible presence of two non-intrinsic ones (practice of concordance;transmission).363Seen in the context of Faivre’s intellectual development, as brieflysketched above, it is clear that this definition was not invented fromscratch. The notion of correspondences was inseparable from the “ana-logical thinking” that he had highlighted from the start, and had figuredas a crucial dimension of “hermeticism” in Faivre’s own writings as wellas those of thinkers like Durand.364We have seen that the crucial notionof imagination/mediations was derived straight from Corbin’s conceptsof themundus imaginalis; but by combining it with living nature, Faivresteered away from any docetic understanding towards an incarnationalperspective in line with the central notion ofNaturphilosophie. Transmuta-tion was perhaps the most innovative aspect: obviously inspired by Faivre’slong-standing interest in “spiritual” alchemy and paracelsian thought, itlent a dynamic and developmental aspect to what might otherwise havebeen a somewhat static picture of “esotericism.”365In addition, most of362Faivre,L’ ́esot ́erisme(1992),4.363Ibid.,13–21. In the same year,1992, the definition was presented in English in Faivre and Needleman,Modern Esoteric Spirituality(Faivre, “Introductioni”). The notion of a “form of thought” wassuggested by Faivre’s colleague ́Emile Poulat (Faivre, “ ́Emile Poulat,”211–212).364See notably Durand’s large contribution to the Eranos meeting of1973devoted to correspondences(“Similitude herm ́etique”).365In terms of my distinction between two paradigms as outlined above (Chapter3,pp.192–195),Faivre’s definition clearly favors the “Alchemical” one over its “Platonic” alternative, which may"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"354The truth of historythe elements that were central to his earlier conceptualizations (esotericismas hermeneutics, the notion of interiority, the autonomization of “esoteri-cism” after the twelfth century, the centrality of mythical thinking, andesotericism as a “counterpart of our scientific and secularized vision of theworld”)366all figured prominently in his Introduction, although no longeras parts of a polemics against “modernity.”Faivre has always emphasized that the four intrinsic characteristics aremore or less inseparable by nature; and, as a result, it is clear that thecentral tradition of an incarnational Christian theosophy has remainedthe heart and core of what he sees as “esotericism.” It is consistent withthis focus that, to give just a few examples, such phenomena asmagianaturalisand sophiology are accepted as belonging to the field only insofaras they appear within a theosophical discourse; that nineteenth-centuryspiritualism may often have been “intimately mingled” with esotericismbut is not seen as belonging to that domain “properly speaking”; or that thecontemporary “New Age,” in spite of its dependence on traditional esotericcurrents, is seen as pertaining to the field of new religious movementsrather than esotericism. Faivre has maintained these demarcations andexclusions in all later revisions and translations ofL’ ́esot ́erisme.367Thisleads us to an unavoidable conclusion: his definition of esotericism –now deliberately presented as strictly heuristic and open to criticism andfuture revision – originated as a Christian and religionist notion of “true”esotericism, and retains its fundamental anti-docetic, anti-idealist, andanti-dualist perspective. Therefore it comes at a price: it is hard to see how,for instance, the docetic and post-Cartesian theosophy of Swedenborg, thepure idealism of Gu ́enonian Traditionalism, or the gnostic/cathar dualismof theLectorium Rosicrucianum, could consistently be seen as forms of“esotericism” in terms of Faivre’s definition. Moreover, the latter describesessentially an “enchanted” worldview pitted against the “secularization ofthe cosmos,”368and this makes it doubtful, to say the least, whether itcan account for the secularizationofesotericism itself since the nineteenthcentury.369In fairness to Faivre, he has never denied that his approach doescontain elements of “mediation” such as Ficino’sspiritus, but nevertheless tends to highlight thepure intellect and look negatively at nature and the body.366Faivre,L’ ́esot ́erisme(1992),6(hermeneutics),9(interiority),9–10(autonomization),11(mythicalthinking as opposed to modern science and secularization).367Faivre,L’ ́esot ́erisme(1992),12,86.

When James Webb published histwo seminal volumes on what he called the “occult underground” and the“occult establishment” in the mid-1970s, he still presented them as examplesof a rearguard “flight from reason.”371Other pioneers in this domain, suchas Christopher McIntosh, Ellic Howe, or Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke,372didnot feel a need to condemn the supposed “irrationality” of occultism butsimply emphasized its significance as a historical factor whose presence andinfluence could not be denied. Yet others were inspired by explicit com-mitment to the “inner traditions” of the West, and hoped that bringingthem to the attention of a wider audience might stimulate a new spiritualrevival.373What set these new trends of scholarly and popular writing apartfrom the predominantly sociological concern with new religious move-ments was their attention to history, and especially the history of ideas.With various degrees of emphasis, all these authors noted that the “occult”milieus since the nineteenth century had to be understood as continuationsof older traditions that went back to early modern times and ultimatelylate antiquity.While a flood of new scholarship in these domains emerged during the1970sand1980s, the academy did not yet have any institutional settings ordisciplinary frameworks that were able to accommodate them as belongingto a distinct field of research.

It was only in the yearsafter1992that this situation began to improve. As Antoine Faivre’s writingsbegan to be translated into English, his concept of “Western esotericism”appeared to be capable of accommodating the new wave of scholarship in“the occult” as part of a much wider historical vision that encompassed theentire period from the Renaissance on, with due recognition of its ultimatesources in late antiquity. As increasing emphasis came to be placed oncritical historiography and empiricism – instead of scholarship with covertapologetic or even missionary pro-esoteric agendas – this made it possiblefor the study of “Western esotericism” to be admitted into the academy asa legitimate field of scholarly research.374As usual in such cases, this development has been accompanied byvigorous theoretical and methodological debate among a relatively smallnumber of specialized scholars.375In this final section I will not analyzethese discussions in technical detail: doing so with any degree of accuracywould result in a disproportionately lengthy microhistory, out of balancewith the broader scope of this book. Moreover, far from being closed orresolved, the academic debate on “esotericism” is very much alive andevolving at the time of writing, and the author of these lines is himselfstrongly involved in it. Standing too close to historical events always makesit difficult to evaluate them with a sufficient measure of critical distanceor objectivity, and obviously even more so if the historian finds himselfand his ideas among the topics being studied.

I willtherefore restrict myself to a short outline of the main developments thathave taken place on an institutional level, and of the main developmentson a theoretical level. While I cannot presume to be neutral in presentingsuch an account, I will at least try to be fair.At a conference in1992, I made the acquaintance of Antoine Faivre,and in the wake of this meeting we decided to try and organize a series ofsessions on “Western esotericism” at the quinquennial conference of theInternational Association for the History of Religions (IAHR) in MexicoCity,1995. We collaborated on this project with Karen Voss, an Americanscholar of religions in the tradition of Eliade; and to raise awareness inview of the Mexico event, Faivre and Voss co-authored a programmaticarticle on “Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions” publishedin the IAHR’s journalNumenin1995.376Around the same time, we hadintensive discussions about a methodological article published by me inthe same year, in which I defended an “empirical” approach to the study ofWestern esotericism.377Responding to current debates between defendersof sociological “reductionism” and thesui generisapproach of “religionist”scholars in the tradition of Eliade, I argued for a third approach grounded in“methodological agnosticism”: regardless of a scholar’s personal beliefs (orlack of them), the existence or non-existence of divine or sacred realitiesis simply beyond empirical verification or falsification by scholarsquascholars. Therefore a scholar may or may not personally share the beliefsof those he studies, but in his research he should limit himself to what canbe verified empirically and historically: he can describe, analyze, interpret,or even seek to explain what people believe, but cannot affirm that theyare either right or wrong. Applied to the study of esotericism, this simpleprinciple ruled out both religionist and reductionist perspectives, whilemaking room for consistently historical research. It was also meant to implya healthy dose of modesty with regard to the scholarly enterprise, whichis limited to the empirical and can neither presume to make statementsabout the existence or non-existence of metaphysical realities, nor strictlyrule out the possible legitimacy of such statements made by believers.378376Faivre and Voss, “Western Esotericism.”377Hanegraaff, “Empirical Method.” For a further application to Western esotericism, see Hanegraaff,“On the Construction”; “Some Remarks.”378Of course such an “empirical” approach does not imply any naive belief in “detached” objectivity.It does not deny the subjectivities of the scholar, but advocates a critical attitude towards one’sown biases as well as those of others (“Empirical Method,”107–108; “On the Construction,”16).For a very similar perspective, cf. Max Weber,Wissenschaft als Beruf."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"358The truth of historyIn his subsequent writings, Faivre embraced methodological agnosti-cism as a basic principle, and thereby made a final and clean break withreligionism.379During the sessions in Mexico City, presided over by Faivreand myself, the effect of our commitment to empirical/historical researchbecame evident almost immediately: it resulted in a clear distance betweenthe “religionist” participants, who found it natural to use their researchas a vehicle for expressing esoteric or spiritual commitments, and their“historically-oriented” counterparts who had no wish to do so. The selectedproceedings of the Mexico volume were published in1998,380and ses-sions on Western esotericism became a normal part of subsequent IAHRconferences (Durban2000,Tokyo2005, Toronto2010). The religionistperspective became very much a non-issue at least in this venue; and asimilar development took place in the context of the American Academyof Religions.381A breakthrough event for the academic legitimation of Western eso-tericism as a field of research occurred in1999, when the University ofAmsterdam decided to create the world’s second academic chair devotedto this field (after the one held by Faivre at the EPHE), together withtwo assistant professorships, two Ph.D. positions and a secretary.382Ihad the honor of being appointed to this chair, which now made it possibleto create a complete academic curriculum for Western esotericism. Sincethen, my colleagues for Western esotericism in the early modern period(subsequently Jean-Pierre Brach, Kocku von Stuckrad, and Peter J. For-shaw) and in the eighteenth to twenty-first century (Olav Hammer, thenMarco Pasi) and I have had the privilege of teaching a new generation ofyoung academics from all over the world,383many of whom have contin-ued to pursue Ph.D. positions and will therefore contribute to the futuredevelopment of the field on an international scale. Furthermore, the suc-cess of the Amsterdam chair encouraged several other academic institutes379See in particular “L’ ́esot ́erisme et la recherche universitaire” (trans. inTheosophy, Imagination,Tradition, xiii–xxxv). In his earlier work, Faivre had followed the common religionist assumptionthat “historicism” implies reductionism and “agnosticism” is a polite term for unbelief; but froman empirical perspective there is no binding logic to either of these assumptions, so that the scholarremains free to hold any personal belief that does not conflict with demonstrable empirical andhistorical facts.380Faivre and Hanegraaff,Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion.381Hanegraaff, “Study of Western Esotericism,”505–506.

And last but not least, due to the initiative of oneof its senior editors, Hans van der Meij, a comprehensiveDictionary ofGnosis and Western Esotericism(over1200pages, withc.150contributors)was published by Brill in2005.385The combined effect of these variousefforts, and the insistence on historical/empirical approaches, was that theterm “Western esotericism” has begun to shed its doubtful connotations inacademic debate during the first decade of the twenty-first century, partic-ularly in the context of the study of religion, and ever greater numbers ofinternational scholars now present themselves as engaged in research thatfalls under this umbrella. As a result, numerous conferences on variousaspects of esotericism are now being organized each year, and two aca-demic organizations for scholars in this field have been created in Europeand the United States.386Finally, whereas Faivre in his entry “Esotericism”for Eliade’sEncyclopedia of Religion(1987) could still state that “There is nosingle book on the history of esotericism,”387today a choice of introductorytextbooks is available.388Institutional and publicational developments apart, the success ofFaivre’s definition and the “empirical turn” in the study of Western eso-tericism have been the most crucial factors in this process of academicemancipation: the former by creating a conceptual umbrella covering the384Goodrick-Clarke, “Western Esotericism in the United Kingdom”; Neugebauer-W ̈olk, “From Talkabout Esotericism to Esotericism Research”; and see the two volumes edited by Neugebauer-W ̈olk,Aufkl ̈arung und Esoterik(1999,2008).385Hanegraaff (in collaboration with Antoine Faivre, Roelof van den Broek, and Jean-Pierre Brach),Dictionary.386The European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism (ESSWE) and the US-based Associa-tion for the Study of Esotericism (ASE).387Faivre, “Esotericism,”163.388Von Stuckrad,Western Esotericism; Versluis,Magic and Mysticism; Goodrick-Clarke,The WesternEsoteric Traditions; Faivre,Western Esotericism."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"360The truth of historyentire period from the Renaissance to the present, the second by convinc-ing academic communities that this field could be studied without anycovert agendas of pro-esoteric apologeticism.

Instead, most of them have been seduced bywhat I would call “the checklist approach to Western esotericism”: simplycheck whether you can detect something that looks like the four intrin-sic characteristics in any type of material, and if you succeed, you have“proven” that it is “esoteric”!389In doing so, one ignores what the fourintrinsic characteristics were supposed to mean in their original context:for example, the incarnational agenda is missed by almost everybody whojust looks for references to the “imagination” and likes the idea of seeingit as an “organ of knowledge” rather than just fantasy. Thus taken out ofcontext and turned into abstractions, the Faivrean characteristics becomeempty containers that may be filled with almost anything, theosophical orotherwise. The result is a strange paradox. While Faivre’s definition mightbe criticized for being too restrictive in suggesting that only the “form ofthought” of an incarnational Christian theosophy is truly “esoteric,” theway it has actually beenusedproduces exactly the opposite effect: ratherthan demarcating a field, it ends up dissolving its boundaries. Since Faivrehimself writes that the components can be distributed quite unevenly,only the scantiest evidence sometimes seems sufficient to magically turnthe most disparate materials into species of “esotericism.” In addition, thedefinition is often understood in an essentialist manner, suggesting that itdescribes some kind of esotericismsui generis.Theresultis,ofcourse,yetanother relapse into religionism.These problems are related to the fact that for many scholars today –especially those working on late modern and contemporary topics – thelabel “esotericism” seems to have been transformed from an academicliability into a desired commodity: instead of excluding them, it now givesthem access to networks and podia where their work will be taken seriously.At first sight it might look encouraging that so many scholars are now eager389Hanegraaff, “The Study,”507–508.

Inrecent years, too many scholars with doubtful credentials have been joiningthe new community of “esotericism studies” out of pure convenience, if notopportunism. By using the checklist approach, one may easily turn Faivre’sdefinition into an “admission ticket” for whatever one’s focus of interestmay be, without much concern for the theoretical or methodological issuesinvolved. In order for the study of Western esotericism to have a solid futurein the academy, and for the debate on methods and theories to have anysense at all, it will be essential to keep insisting on high scholarly standardsand critical debate.Finally, as the study of “esotericism” began to gain scholarly recogni-tion after1992, it naturally got involved with wider academic trends andperspectives in the humanities generally, and the study of religion morespecifically. Most influential by far has been the notion ofdiscourse.Assummarized by Olav Hammer in a landmark study of2001:Using the term discourse draws attention to the mechanisms of ideology andpower that include and accept certain voices, while at the same time excludingothers. It implies that certain propositions regarding the human condition and theconstitution of reality, which are historically contingent and culturally constructed,are presented within the discourse as if they were natural, trans-historical facts andthus protected from scrutiny. The limits of the discourse also define the boundariesof what may tolerably be questioned.390The relevance to “esotericism” is almost too obvious to need further empha-sis. Any reader who has followed the thread of my argument up to thispoint will recognize how omnipresent such discursive mechanisms of ide-ology and power have been throughout the story that I have been trying totell. The same goes, no less obviously, for the three “discursive strategies”highlighted by Hammer, based upon the appeal to “tradition,” “rationalityand science,” and “experience”:391by and large, they have dominated mychapters1and2,3,and4respectively. While Hammer applied a discursiveanalysis to the “strategies of epistemology” typical of modern theosophyand the New Age, the intellectual history outlined in the present bookwould be perfect material for an analysis along similar lines.While Hammer used discourse analysis within the wider framework of atext-based intellectual history, others have argued that a “discursive study ofreligion” should become the normative framework for all future research.

For the field of “esotericism” specifically,the most vocal proponent of this position in recent years is undoubtedlyKocku von Stuckrad. I will end this chapter with a short discussion of hisperspective, because it represents currently the most significant challengeto how “Western esotericism” has come to be understood in the wakeof Faivre’s work. As will be seen, von Stuckrad’s work converges in aninteresting manner with my own findings in the present book; but histheoretical and methodological apparatus comes at a price that not allscholars will be willing to pay.As he notes himself, von Stuckrad “wrestled with the concept of ‘West-ern esotericism’ for years.”392His early work was focused on the historyof astrology in late antiquity, and at the time he still saw it as repre-sentative of an esoteric worldview dominated by “correspondences” inthe sense of Faivre’s definition and, particularly, the Jung–Pauli theory ofsynchronicity.393As von Stuckrad began to broaden his scope of researchin the following years, Faivre’s definition remained an important point ofreference; but he began to express reservations particularly about its concen-tration on Christian esotericism in the early modern period, at the expenseof “the vivid Esoteric discourse in late antiquity and medieval times”394and in Jewish and Islamic culture.395Around2003, several methodological392Von Stuckrad,Locations of Knowledge,x.393The methodological part of von Stuckrad’s large study of Jewish and Christian perspectiveson astrology in late antiquity culminated in a thoroughly affirmative discussion of WolfgangPauli’s interpretations of quantum mechanics (Das Ringen,87–101); and in his general history ofastrology, he emphasized Pauli’s adoption of Jung’s theory of synchronicity (Geschichte der Astrologie,337–343; see also “Entsprechungsdenken”). Noting that historians criticize Jung’s approach as a“tautological construct” whereas it has found support among scholars of religion like Eliade andCorbin (Geschichte der Astrologie,338–339), he took the latter’s side: the historians’ objections wereignored, but the “phenomenological” similarity between synchronicity and an “esoteric” worldviewof correspondences was presented as highly significant for understanding the nature of astrology(ibid.,339,341,343; for an alternative historical perspective, according to which Jung’s theory is apsychological reformulation of theories first formulated by, for example, Pico, Agrippa, Paracelsus,Kepler, or Leibniz, see Hanegraaff,New Age Religion,501). As noted by Steven Vanden Broecke,von Stuckrad’s theoretical perspective on ancient astrology relied on popular “New Age” mixturesof synchronicity and quantum mechanics as published by F. David Peat (Das Ringen,95–98), andhis general topic was defined with reference to late twentieth-century manuals of astrology for thegeneral public (review of von Stuckrad,104).394Von Stuckrad, “Recent Studies,”213.395Ibid.; von Stuckrad,Schamanismus,29;Was ist Esoterik?,14;Western Esotericism,5; “WesternEsotericism,”83. Von Stuckrad also adopted my reservations about whether Faivre’s criteriologycould account for the “secularization of esotericism” and about the risk of essentialist interpretations(cf. Hanegraaff, “The Study,”507–508). Interestingly, in2005he still believed that “large parts ofwhat I understand by esotericism can also be found in other cultures” (Western Esotericism, xi–xii),"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Esotericism in the academy363articles396announced von Stuckrad’s final break with the “Faivre paradigm”in favor of an ambitious attempt, grounded in post-structuralist theory, “tointegrate the study of esotericism into the study of European history ofreligion.”397The final outcome of this process of conceptual reorientationwas published in2010under the titleLocations of Knowledge in Medievaland Early Modern Europe.In this book, von Stuckrad rejects the notion of “Western esotericism”as “an objectively identifiable ‘tradition’ or coherent ‘system of thought anddoctrine’ that can be studied as a separate topic.” Instead, he now prefersto speak of “esoteric discourse in Western culture.”398This terminologyshould thereforenotbe understood as a label for a specific field of research,in the sense of a collection of specific currents, ideas, or practices that areseen as sharing certain characteristics or historical connections; instead,it functions as an analytical instrument, in the context of von Stuckrad’sown discourse (!), for deconstructing the traditional master narrative of “amonolithic Christian occident” and a whole set of closely related assump-tions about religion and modernity.399As he explains, this “singularizingdiscourse” can be analyzed in terms of complex processes of identity for-mation in which important dimensions of Western culture have beenthereby suggesting a substantivist and potentially essentialist understanding of “esotericism” thatwould seem to conflict with his eventual discursive approach.396See notably von Stuckrad, “Discursive Study of Religion”; “Relative, Contingent, Determined”;“Western Esotericism.”397Von Stuckrad,Locations of Knowledge, xi,137.398Ibid., x–xi. Accordingly, he gives no definition of esotericism, and suggests that his approach willmake the very concept superfluous (ibid.,64). Presumably, this also undermines his own previousattempts at demonstrating “what is esotericism” and writing “its” history (Was ist Esoterik?andWestern Esotericism).399Von Stuckrad,Locations of Knowledge,4,7–18. Von Stuckrad is right in suggesting that theterminology of “Western esotericism” for a field that is actually dominated by Christianity andmodernity risks giving food to a singularizing and hegemonizing discourse of the “Christianoccident” that marginalizes Judaism and Islam as somehow less “Western.” However, I believe thatthe approach presented in the present book resolves this problem. Whereas von Stuckrad’s conceptof “esoteric discourse” is designed to include Judaism and Islam, my analysis implies that whetherwe like it or not, our very concepts of Western esotericismdidindeed emerge as a singularizingand hegemonizing construct (directed, however, against “paganism” more than against Judaism orIslam) in the context of specifically Protestant and Enlightenment polemics (see the Conclusion).This brings up the question of whether this process has parallels in the Jewish and Islamic contexts:for example, when Heinrich Graetz constructed kabbalah as a “fungous layer” surrounding thehealthy core of Judaism (Sch ̈afer, “‘Adversus cabbalam’”; Hanegraaff, “Beginnings of OccultistKabbalah,”109–110), did this reflect only a post-Enlightenment ideology that he shared withChristian colleagues and projected back on to Jewish history; or did it reflect an autonomousprocess of polemical exclusion rooted in Jewish history, parallel to but independent from the onethat I have been analyzing for the Christian context? These questions lead beyond my competencebut should certainly be explored by scholars of Jewish esotericism."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"364The truth of historystructurally excluded or marginalized as “Other.” To correct the simplify-ing pictures that have been the result, and that still dominate much of thecurrent scholarly and popular discourse,400we must sharpen our awarenessnot just of the plurality of religious options in the history of Europe, but,rather, of religiouspluralismas a dynamic process that involves the active(polemical and apologetic) negotiation of identity and difference.401Steering away from an emphasis on religious “traditions” and theirinternal dynamics (including, of course, that of an autonomous “esoterictradition”),402von Stuckrad seeks to demonstrate this agenda by focusingon “esoteric” discourses, in a Foucauldian sense, that transgress or ignore theboundaries between religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the literarytransmission and continuation of “pagan” or “polytheistic” alternatives) aswell as between societal systems such as religion, philosophy, science, art, orpolitics. Concerning the first type of pluralism, hisexemplaare concernedwith the “secrets” of direct religious experience, textual hermeneutics, andastrological concepts of time;403concerning the second type, they focus on“interferences” between religion and science, art, and politics.404To makesuch an enterprise possible, the notion of “esoteric discourse(s)” is nowdefined by him in a new way, as “a secretive dialectic of concealment andrevelation which is concerned with perfect knowledge.”405The notionsofsecrecyas social capital (along the lines of Georg Simmel and PierreBourdieu) andclaims of perfect knowledgehave therefore become central tovon Stuckrad’s analysis, within a theoretical framework that operates with“fields, communication, structure, and discourse”406and has the goal oftrying to “identify genealogies of identities in a pluralistic competition ofknowledge.”407Von Stuckrad’s agenda for the study of religion in Europe is ambitiousand interesting, but it comes at a price. The basic notion of a “singularizingdiscourse” in Western intellectual culture, that constructs its own identity400See, for example, political discussion in the European Parliament about the “Christian roots ofEurope,” with immediate implications for questions such as whether a country like Turkey shouldor should not be admitted into the European Union (von Stuckrad,Locations of Knowledge,18).401Ibid.,19–20.402For von Stuckrad’s polemics against “tradition” as an analytical term, see hisChapter2(ibid.,25–42). Unfortunately, his discussion ofprisca theologiaandphilosophia perennisignores theirfoundations in patristic discourse, and – largely for that reason – overlooks the problematic natureof Idel’s unilinear/multilinear theory (seeChapter1,pp.58–61). Apart from this, one might arguethat the notion of a “twofold pluralism” should be expanded into a threefold one: next to pluralismas the “organization of difference” between religions and between societal systems, why not analyzeitwithinreligions as well?403Ibid.,chapters4–6.404Ibid., chapters7–9.405Ibid.,67.406Ibid.,59.

Accordingly,von Stuckrad’s true concern is with general discursive processes of iden-tity formation by means of exclusion, marginalization, or “othering,”notwith the historical currents or ideas that have been excluded, marginalizedor “othered.” The latter make their appearance only asexemplathat areuseful to illustrate more “fundamental” discursive processes, not as objectsofresearchthatdeserveattentionintheirownright.Asaresult,itisnotjust the term “esotericism” that vanishes as a useful concept, but muchof the historical material will vanish as well! To pick a random example,if Lodovico Lazzarelli discusses the way towards true felicity in hisCraterHermetis, most of his subtle and intricate discussion is bound to be ignoredas irrelevant to the specific concerns of discourse analysis; and rather thanas making an attempt at formulating his deepest religious beliefs, Lazzarelliwill be seen as making “claims of higher knowledge” to improve his strategicposition in a pluralistic field of discourse, for example to gain the patronageof King Ferrante or impress his teacher Correggio. The problem is not justthe cynicism of such a perspective, which seems blind to anything exceptcompetitions over power and capital. More crucially, the problem lies inits approach to textual research: from a consistent discursive perspective aspresented by von Stuckrad, the important thing is not what Lazzarelli wastrying to tell his readers, but only what his discourse might be tellingus.Of course there is nothing wrong with such an analysis in itself: onthe contrary, it may yield very interesting insights. The problem lies in anexclusivist and reductionist subtext that automatically devalues “contentsand ideas” in favor of “structures,” makes history subservient to theory, andendsuppromotingdiscursiveapproachesastheonlyvalid methodology inthe study of religion, esoteric or otherwise409(while insinuating that failureto comply with such hegemonic claims is proof of some covert “religionist,”“essentialist,” or “phenomenological” agenda).410This brings us back, once408From his side, von Stuckrad likewise notes the similarities with my project (first announced in myarticle “Forbidden Knowledge” of2005) of reconstructing “a genealogy of what today is referredto as esotericism,” with central attention to polemics and identities (Locations of Knowledge,52,cf.60).409For strong exclusivist claims on behalf of discursive approaches, see, for example, “DiscursiveStudy,”263,265,268.410For example, von Stuckrad,Locations of Knowledge,52;“Reflections,”163."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"366The truth of historyagain, to the theme of “history and truth.” Like much of current Ameri-can debate in the study of religion, von Stuckrad’s theoretical frameworkassumes that “theory” (and metatheory) trumps historiography. Only onthat basis can one claim that, for example, the subjectivities of the scholarmake it “impossible” for him to write a convincing historical narrative, the“recursion of contingency” traps him in an infinite hermeneutical regres-sion, authorial intent is a chimaera, or there are no such things as “facts,”“evidence,” or “proof.”411Even where these arguments are philosophicallycogent, they still remind one of an archer who claims that one need noteven try to hit a target because Zenon’s paradox proves that the arrow willnever reach it. No responsible historian today is unaware of the theoreticaland methodological problems of historiography, or adheres naively to aRankean ideal of finding outwie est eigentlich gewesen.412But rather thanallowing philosophy to paralyze them, good historians know from workingexperience that it is possible to improve our knowledge about what hap-pened in the past, that the sources can speak to us and we can understandmuch of what they tell us, and that misrepresentations of past events canbe recognized as such and replaced by better interpretations.413If nothing else, discursive approaches are salutary reminders of howdeeply knowledge is implicated with power; and they can be invaluable inanalyzing such processes as identity formation and “othering,” or exposingthe ideological subtexts of scholarly research. But useful though they are,we cannot allow them to dictate or dominate the entire agenda of historicalresearch.

For von Stuckrad’s discussion of various philosophicaldilemmas, see his articles mentioned in n.396;andcf.Locations of Knowledge,195–200,and“Reflections.”412See, for example, Evans,In Defense of History,16–26andpassim.413My issue is not with the philosophical debate as such (strongly influenced, in von Stuckrad’scase, by Richard Rorty’sPhilosophy and the Mirror of Nature), nor would I be so foolish as todeny the importance of philosophical reflection on historiographical method. My point is simplythat the theoretical superiority of von Stuckrad’s postmodernism is by no means self-evident: asdemonstrated for example by Mary Fulbrook (Historical Theory,28–30andpassim), historicalempiricism does not exclude self-reflexivity and theoretical awareness. As regards Foucauldiandiscourse, which was intended as an attack against historiography and historians, one cannotignore the fact that Foucault’s philosophical sophistication went at the expense of his historicalanalyses, which are often wholly mistaken (Huppert, “Divinatio et eruditio”; Hutton, “FoucaultPhenomenon”; Maclean, “Foucault’s Renaissance Episteme Reassessed”; Windschuttle,Killing ofHistory,121–157;Qu ́etel,Histoire de la folie,89–98,239–246,515–520)."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Esotericism in the academy367place of what others call “Western esotericism,” far too many of the his-torical materials that have barely begun to return to the academic agendawould once again vanish from sight or lose much of their content, depth,and complexity.

Thereare very suggestive commonalities that structure the discourse as a whole;and in spite of its great diversity, it refers to real historical currents and ideasthat are grouped under a label such as “esotericism”notjust arbitrarily, butfor specific reasons that have as much to do with their own nature andintellectual content as with the discourse that constructs them as such.There is something “out there” after all. What, then, are the historicalrealities that made it possible, perhaps even inevitable, for “esotericism” tobe eventually constructed as a domain of its own?An obvious red thread runs through my entire narrative in the fourchapters of this book: we have seen that an intellectual culture groundedin biblical monotheism and Greek rationality was forced to come to termswith the presence ofpaganism. The development of what we now callWestern esotericism is unimaginable without this fundamental fact. I willnot try to summarize the argument in my previous chapters, but merelypoint out that the “wisdom of the pagans” was the heart and core of theancient wisdom narrative, the central target of Catholic and (especially)Protestant polemicists culminating in the anti-apologetic current, and theprincipal object of ridicule for Enlightenment critics. The polemical dis-course that I have tried to analyze in its historical development resultedfirst in a historiographical concept of “Platonic-Hermetic Christianity” asthe crypto-pagan “Other” of true Christianity and rational philosophy;and having been expelled from intellectual discourse altogether, it endedup as a discredited waste-basket category of rejected knowledge.The factor of “paganism” has been neglected by modern scholars ofWestern esotericism to an extent that seems amazing at first sight: while theimportance of its specific historical manifestations (particularly hermetism)is obviously recognized, it plays no structural role in how the field has beenconstructed or defined.3This blind spot is understandable in light of mydiscussions inChapter4. When the contents of the “waste-basket” wererediscovered as a serious object of research by modern scholars – fromEnnemoser to Faivre – most of them approached it from a religionist2In short, “there is no data for esotericism” (cf. Jonathan Z. Smith,Imagining Religion, xi).3For example, scholars in the Eranos tradition, including Faivre, thought of their topic in terms ofuniversal categories such as “myth” (versus logos); a scholar like Peuckert in terms of traditionalrural culture (versus modern bourgeois culture); and Thorndike or Yates in terms of “magic” (versusscience). In all these cases, “paganism” as a concept is hovering in the background without beingnamed or problematized explicitly."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"370Conclusion: Restoring memoryperspective. We have seen that it is typical of such approaches that, evenif they are engaged in direct historical study of primary sources, they stilltend to downplay the importance of “external” historical influences infavor of the reference to some universal, transcendent, or “inner” spiritualreality associated with the sacred or the divine. From that point of view,to explain esoteric currents in terms of syncretistic processes is bound tobe experienced as reductionist and, more generally, as missing the wholepoint about them. If the ultimate referent of esotericism is somesui generisdimension of the sacred, then its “external” manner of manifestation –whether pagan, Christian, Jewish, or even secular – must be of secondaryimportance by definition, if indeed it has any meaning at all.The only intellectual approach that took the “pagan” dimension seri-ously was the anti-apologetic historiography pioneered by Jacob Thomas-ius, Colberg, and Brucker. As I argued inChapter2, it was characterizedby amethodologyof historical criticism combined with atheoretical focuson the manifold effects of the encounter between Hellenistic paganismand biblical traditions. This, I suggest, was exactly the right combination.If this basic agenda had been continued and further developed after theEnlightenment (presumably shedding its normative theological assump-tions in the process), the study of “Western esotericism” might well haveestablished itself on secure historical foundations already in the nineteenthcentury. As it happened, this line of inquiry was cut short, for the reasonsexplained inChapters2and3, leading to a scholarly “Waste Land” instead.It will come as no surprise, then, that I see this prematurely abandonedintellectual tradition as the one that points in the right direction for thefuture study of Western esotericism.In his crucialSchediasma historicum, the founder of anti-apologeticismJacob Thomasius highlighted two elements as fundamental to what hesaw as “paganism.” The first was a belief that the world was co-eternalwith God, as opposed to the doctrine ofcreatio ex nihilo;andthis“original fallacy” (\u000e\u0003\u0019\u0005\u0006\u001a \u001b\f\u001c\u001d\u0006\u0007) led to a second one, the “enthusi-astic” belief that human beings could attain direct experiential knowledge(gnosis) of their own divine nature.4The sharpsightedness of Thomas-ius’ analysis was such that even today, in my opinion, it may still fur-nish us with the fundamentals of what can usefully be called Westernesotericism.The first element may take a variety of forms, which can be imaginedon a scale between the outer extremes of a strict “manichaean” dualism4For the exact reasoning, seeChapter2,pp.104–107."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Restoring memory371and a strict pantheism; but by far most typical for the context of “Westernesotericism” are the many intermediary “panentheist” versions that maybe referred to ascosmotheism. This term was coined by Lamoignon deMalesherbes in1782,5and adopted by the Egyptologist Jan Assmann as alogical counterpart to monotheism:The opposite of monotheism is not polytheism, or idolatry, but cosmotheism,the religion of the immanent God and the veiled truth, which both reveals andconceals itself in a thousand images: images that do not logically exclude, butilluminate and complement one another...A divine world does not stand inopposition to the world of cosmos, man, and society; rather, it is a principle thatpermeates it and gives it structure, order and meaning . . . The divine cannot beexcluded from the world.6This is what Frances Yates called – without further explanation – the“religion of the world”7found in the hermetic writings, based upon thefundamental assumption that the divine is at home in the world. Asthe logical alternative to classic monotheism, where the invisible and eternalCreator is strictly separate from his visible and temporal creation, cosmo-theism could never be strictly integrated into a Judaeo-Christian frame-work; but as an integral part of the “pagan” Hellenistic philosophies thatwere adopted into Christian theology from the early patristic period on, itcould not possibly be kept out of it either. Having analyzed the results ofthis dilemma through the first two chapters of this book, I suggest that theemergence of what we now call Western esotericism was made possible bya deep structure of conflict between the dynamics of these two mutuallyexclusive systems and all that they imply. In short, the logical incompatibil-ity of monotheism and cosmotheism has led to an endless series of creativeattempts to resolve it. It is within these dynamics that we can locate every-thing that authors like Colberg and Brucker sought to demarcate fromtrue Christianity and rational philosophy; and when Max Weber definedthe eighteenth-century process of disenchantment as the disappearanceof “mysterious and incalculable powers” from the natural world, he wasdescribing the attempt by new scientists and Enlightenment philosophers5Assmann,Of God and Gods,155n.64.6Assmann,Die mosaische Unterscheidung,64,61,62; for clarity and convenience I have quoted the pas-sages on page64first, followed by those on pp.61–62, which further explain the nature of Assmann’sconcept.

I am not convinced by Peter Sch ̈afer’s critique ofAssmann’s concepts of monotheism and cosmotheism (“Geschichte und Ged ̈achtnisgeschichte,”21–25;“Dasj ̈udische Monopol”; see response in Assmann, “Alle G ̈otter sind eins!”), which seems toreflect a misunderstanding of the concept of mnemohistory (see below, pp.375–376and n.23).7Yates,Giordano Bruno,6andpassim."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"372Conclusion: Restoring memoryto finish the job of Protestant anti-pagan polemics, and get rid of cosmo-theism once and for all. The attempt was unsuccessful. Cosmotheism wascarried forward by Romantics into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,as an alternative to the disenchantment of the world;8and it appeared capa-ble of adapting even to secular conditions, thereby mutating into strangenew forms that would have been unimaginable in previous centuries.9The second element highlighted by Thomasius followed logically fromthe first. The platonic doctrine of emanation and restitution held that thesoul has its origin in an eternal, divine substance and will return to itagain. The implication was that human beings have an inborn capacityfor knowing the divine: they are not dependent on God revealing himselfto them (as in classic monotheism, where the creature is dependent onthe Creator’s initiative), nor is their capacity for knowledge limited to thebodily senses and natural reason (as in science and rational philosophy),but the very nature of their souls allows them direct access to the supreme,eternal substance of Being. Such direct experiential knowledge, or gnosis,is attained through “ecstatic” states of mind. Thus we see that the intuitivenotion of a triad “faith – reason – gnosis”10can be given a precise histor-ical meaning: “gnosis” is not just equivalent to a vague notion of higher,absolute, or perfect knowledge, but stands much more specifically for thepossibility of direct and unmediated, supra-rational, salvational access tothe supreme spiritual level of reality. The aspiration to such knowledge isinseparable from a worldview that makes it theoretically possible: esotericdiscourse is characterized not so much by “claims of higher or perfectknowledge”11but, rather, by the claim that direct knowledge of ultimatereality is possible and available for those who pursue it. This second ele-ment, too, has survived the epistemological rupture of the Enlightenment:we have traced some part of it through Romantic and mesmerist currentsduring the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from Ennemoser throughEranos, and outside the academic context it remains crucial to popular andcontemporary spirituality.12Idonotmean to suggest that these two interrelated elements amount toa definition of Western esotericism, which would allow us to write “its” his-tory as a specific historical tradition or domain. What they do is define the8For example, Hanegraaff, “Romanticism and the Esoteric Connections.”9On the “secularization of esotericism” during the nineteenth century and its survival by means of“evolutionary adaptation,” see Hanegraaff,New Age Religion,411–513; “How Magic Survived theDisenchantment of the World.”10Hanegraaff, “Reason, Faith, and Gnosis.”11As in von Stuckrad,Locations of Knowledge,59–64,here60–61.12Hanegraaff, “Magnetic Gnosis”; “Gnosis.”"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Restoring memory373theoretical limits within which “esoteric” religiosity may develop while stillremaining recognizable as such (not just in Christian and secular contextsbut in Jewish and Islamic ones as well),13but they have little to say about itsactual historical manifestations and its representatives, who seldom attemptto push a massive worldview of “cosmotheism and gnosis” but usually tryto negotiate a space where they may survive within a culture dominated bymonotheism and the appeal to divine revelation and rationality. In otherwords, whereas anti-apologetic polemicists and their kindred spirits tendto suspect the existence of a subversive pagan agenda, and try to expose itby bringing its basic “doctrines” to light, esoteric spiritualities are mostlycreatures of compromise:14their enemies try to sharply exclude them as“Other,” but their representatives or sympathizers usually try to remainincluded. This is why the boundaries of the domain are so vaguely definedand it is so hard to pin down historically: a drift towards cosmotheismand gnosis may be detected with various degrees of emphasis in a varietyof cultural contexts (religion, philosophy, science, art), but seldom in aradical and explicit manner that openly attacks the dominant models anddemands an either/or choice. If “Western esotericism” is perceived as arelatively separate domain, then, this is not because it in fact representsa kind of hidden gnostic and cosmotheist “counterculture” that existedhistorically in Christian and secular society but, rather, because it has beenpolemically constructed as such.This process of polemical construction, followed by the exclusion of theconstruct as “rejected knowledge,” took place in the second half ofthe seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, and is inseparable fromthe construction of modern identities. Protestantism defined itself againstRoman Catholicism, rejecting the latter as a “pagan” degeneration of trueChristianity, but “orthodox” – that is, anti-cosmotheist and anti-gnostic –Protestants discovered to their horror that the same heresies began toappear in Protestant contexts as well. The Enlightenment built directlyupon these Protestant polemics, and defined its own rational and scientificidentity against the same adversary, but no longer granted it the dignityof an intellectual “tradition”: cosmotheist worldviews now came to be per-ceived as vain superstitious belief that nature was inhabited by spirits or13Next to my observations inChapter4,n.399(about studying parallel processes of polemicalexclusion in Jewish and Islamic contexts), I see much potential in studying how the dimensions of“cosmotheism” and “gnosis” have functioned in Judaism and Islam, representing a common groundenabling “discursive transfer” across confessional boundaries.14I use the term “spiritualities” here in a specific sense: see Hanegraaff, “Defining Religion in Spite ofHistory,”371–373; “New Age Spiritualities.”"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"374Conclusion: Restoring memoryghosts, and references to gnosis became virtually indistinguishable fromsilly “enthusiasm.” The former were unscientific, the latter irrational. Suchperspectives no longer needed to be seriously refuted, but could be simplydismissed as “foolishness” and “stupidity.”In this manner, the cultural memory of what we now call “Western eso-tericism” was constructed during the eighteenth century as the polemicalOther of modernity, which was defining its own identity in that very pro-cess. The dynamics in question can be usefully analyzed in terms of under-lying “grammars” of identity/alterity. The ancient wisdom narrative hadbeen governed by what is known in anthropological theory as a grammarof “encompassment”: by being included within a larger framework ofpriscatheologiaorphilosophia perennis, the pagan “Other” could be constructedas really “belonging to us” (that is, Christianity).15In their systematicassault on this narrative, Protestant and Enlightenment polemicists arguedin terms of a very different, polarizing grammar of “orientalization”:16here,one defines one’s own identity (Christian, rational, or scientific) against the“Other” that is being excluded. However, as explained by Gerd Baumann,this type of binary opposition is always subject to reversal, resulting in asophisticated dialectics of rejection and desire.17Its very alterity can turnthe excluded “Other” into an object of attraction, and once it has been con-structed as an “alternative option” in the collective imagination, people maywell shift their allegiance to it. In this manner, what Enlightenment thinkersrejected as bad could be embraced as good by Romantics, who constructedtheir identity in conscious opposition against the “Other” of empty ration-alism and soulless science. The ultimate example is the German mesmericconcept of the “nightside of nature,” grounded in a systematic reversal ofall Enlightenment values, leading finally from Ennemoser’s historiographyto Jungian concepts of the unconscious and a variety of related countercul-tural perspectives concerned with “re-enchanting the world.” It is in thiscontext that the “waste-basket category” created by the Enlightenment wasfinally turned into a positive category that enabled a variety of “inventionsof esoteric tradition” during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.1815Baumann, “Grammars of Identity/Alterity,”25–27.16Ibid.,19–21. While this grammar derives its name from Edward Said’sOrientalism, it is obviouslynot restricted to constructs of Occident/Orient, but can be applied to the general dynamics ofidentity/alterity. Baumann’s third grammar (“segmentation”) is not immediately relevant for ourpresent concerns, in spite of the interesting application to Freemasonry and religious ecumenicism(ibid.,21–24,29–30).17Ibid.,20–21.18Cf.

In the practice of doing research, andeven in explaining that practice and its importance to others or ourselves,this is not a great problem: there is no need to be constantly remindedthat our methodologies (whether in the natural sciences, the social sci-ences, or the humanities) are grounded in the systematic exclusion of suchthings as clairvoyant perception, religious revelations, intuitive understand-ing, occult correspondences, spiritual presences, or non-causal influencesin nature.19The problem lies elsewhere: for eminently scholarly reasons,we need to correct our collective amnesia about large parts of our ownintellectual history, and the ideology-driven distortions of what we stillremember about it. We have seen how Christoph August Heumann, atthe very origin of the modern history of philosophy, advocated a practiceof dumping these aspects of the past into “the sea of oblivion,” because“superstitious idiocies belong in no better library.”20Such attitudes finallyresulted in a dramatic loss of collective memory – in plain language:ignorance – among the intelligentsia and the wider public from the nine-teenth century on.To help understand this process, Jan Assmann’s work is once again useful.In several important publications, he has argued for a distinction betweenhistory and “mnemohistory”: the former refers to what happened in thepast, the latter to how we remember it.21To avoid an ambiguity that hasled to some unfortunate misunderstandings, I propose to expand the ter-minology in a logical manner, by distinguishing between “historiography”and “mnemohistoriography” as well: if the former tries to describe whatactually happened in the past, the latter tries to describe the genesis andhistorical development of what a given cultureimagineshas happened.One problem with our collective memories of the past is that they are19I am not making any statement about the validity or veracity of these notions, but merely pointout that academic research excludes them as methodologies or explanatory theories. One mightthink of their relation to scholarship or science as similar to the relation between sports, such as, forexample, tennis and badminton. Each of them has its own set of rules and restrictions, as well as itsown peculiar possibilities and attractive features. One and the same player can be a practitioner ofboth sports, butnotat the same time: in order to play tennis he needs to accept its rules at least forthe duration of the game, and the same goes for badminton.20SeeChapter2,pp.132–133.21Assmann,Moses the Egyptian,6–22;Das kulturelle Ged ̈achtnis;Religion und kulturelles Ged ̈achtnis;cf. Halbwachs,On Collective Memory. For the difference between Assmann’s use of the concept andmine, cf. Hanegraaff, “Trouble with Images,”112."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"376Conclusion: Restoring memoryhighly selective, as pointed out by Assmann: “for a functional commu-nicative memory, forgetting is as important as remembering. Hence it isnot ‘photographic.’ Remembering means allowing other things to recedeinto the background, making distinctions, making many things fade out inorder to highlight others.”22Furthermore, our collective memories hardlybother to distinguish between demonstrable facts and fictional constructs,so that the latter may easily get confused with the former. For example,it is unlikely that the pure or “classic” monotheism referred to above everexisted in ancient Israel, or that such an ideology was sharply pitted againsta “cosmotheist” alternative, or indeed that its supposed founder Moses wasa historical personality at all.23However, that these are all mnemohistoricalfictions does not make them historically insignificant or irrelevant: on thecontrary, it is precisely the black-and-white simplicity of what Assmanncalls the “mosaic distinction” between monotheism and its “pagan” Otherthat has made it so effective in polemical and apologetic discourse – muchmore effective, in fact, than any historical facts about what really hap-pened – and a mnemohistoriographical analysis can show in detail howit has had an impact on real historical events in intellectual and religiousculture.The relevance to my analysis in the previous chapters should be obvi-ous. In investigating how intellectuals from the fifteenth century to thepresent have been constructing a tradition or domain that we would nowa-days recognize as “Western esotericism,” I have been focusing deliberatelyon the mnemohistorical dimension: my concern has been primarily withthe powerful stories that they created, and only secondarily with the truenature of the historical realities about which they were telling those sto-ries. Throughout my account we have seen evidence for the remarkable22Assmann,Religion und kulturelles Ged ̈achtnis,13.23Peter Sch ̈afer has dismissed Assmann’s antithesis of monotheism versus cosmotheism as a “historicalfiction” (“Geschichte und Ged ̈achtnisgeschichte,”24), but in my view that is precisely the wholepoint. Pure monotheism (or what I call “classic monotheism” in the text of this chapter) is amnemohistorical fiction: like its legendary founder Moses, it is located in the collective imaginationrather than in actual history (see text, above). A mnemohistoriographical analysis can trace how thisfiction has emerged and developed through history, and the results can be critically compared withhistoriographical findings about, for example, the religion of ancient Israel. Attacking the “mosaicdistinction” on the level of historiography is therefore missing the point. The terminologicalambiguity that caused this misunderstanding seems to derive from the fact that “mnemohistory”as used by Assmann could be understood either as anobjectof historical research or as a specificmethodfor doing research (“doing history”). In my usage, there is only one method or practice,but it may be called historiography if applied to history and mnemohistoriography if appliedto mnemohistory. Obviously, mnemohistorical fictions eventually become factors in history; andcritical historiography can therefore make use of mnemohistoriographical analysis to interpret andexplain historical developments."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Restoring memory377discursive power of mnemohistorical constructs, which largely create thephenomena that they claim to describe while suppressing or distortingany evidence that would undermine the clarity of the narrative. I believethat the conclusion is unavoidable. “Western esotericism” is an imaginativeconstruct in the minds of intellectuals and the wider public, not a straight-forward historical reality “out there”; but, as argued above, it does referto religious tendencies and worldviews that have a real existence and fallwithin the structural parameters first defined by Jacob Thomasius. Theseparameters do not reside in a space of mental abstractions or theoreticalabsolutes, but are grounded in the dynamics of monotheistic religion andthe appeal to faith and reason: in a few words, cosmotheism and gnosisemerge as alternativesbecausethe divine is held to be separate from theworld and inaccessible to human knowledge.Against the eclecticism ingrained in post-Enlightenment thought, andthe highly selective mnemohistorical narratives that resulted from it, I havebeen advocating an anti-eclectic historiography:24one that does not selectonly what it believes to be “true” or “serious,” but questions the establishedcanon of modern intellectual and academic culture (its collective “mem-ory bank”) and recognizes that our common heritage is of much greaterrichness and complexity than one would infer from standard academictextbooks. To give just a few obvious examples, it is simply unacceptableto reduce figures like Marsilio Ficino or Giovanni Pico della Mirandola tomere footnotes in the history of philosophy, as remains standard in mostcurrent philosophy programs and textbooks; it is unacceptable to excludealchemy or astrology from the history of science, as scholars have finallybegun to realize; it is unacceptable to reduce the eighteenth century to an“Age of Reason” by silently ignoring the overwhelming evidence that it wasan age of illuminism and theosophy as well, where “esoteric” perspectivesprovided intermediary positions between traditional orthodoxy and radicalunbelief; it is unacceptable to dismiss occultist trends as mere survivals thatare irrelevant to the culture of modernity; and it is unacceptable to interpretall forms of contemporary esotericism as irrational nonsense or threats todemocracy by default. What makes all such approaches, and many similarones, unacceptable is their systematic selectivity: their unquestioning will-ingness to recognize only what fits an ideological program, while ignoringor distorting any empirical or historical evidence that might spoil it. Anti-eclectic historiography obviously does not claim to discard mechanisms ofselection altogether: it goes without saying that any historian, including the24SeeChapter2,page152."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"378Conclusion: Restoring memoryauthor of these lines, makes his own choices of what to focus on and whatnot. The point is, rather, to provide an antidote against the view that his-torians should select their materials on the basis of normative, doctrinal, orphilosophical judgments. More specifically, the point is to be aware of howthe hegemonic discourses of modernity are themselves built upon earliermnemohistorical narratives (mostly concerned, as we have seen, with con-structed memories of “paganism”) rather than on critical and evenhandedattention to all the available evidence.This brings me to my conclusions. The study of “Western esotericism”should be firmly grounded, first and foremost, in a straightforward historio-graphical agenda: that of exploring the many blank spaces on our mentalmaps and filling them in with color and detail, so that they become integralparts of the wider landscape that we already knew, or thought we knew.In this process, what used to be strange and alien will eventually becomenormalized as just another dimension of Western culture; and discreditedvoices concerned with “cosmotheism” and “gnosis” will be taken seriouslyas representing possible ways of looking at the nature of reality and thepursuit of knowledge. These perspectives may still not be acceptable withinacademic discourse, which has approaches and methodological principlesall of its own, but need not on that account be dismissed as dangerous,stupid, or wrong. Like art or poetry, they may be respected as pursuitsand viewpoints that are clearly different from academic ones, but that havetheir own traditions and legitimacy, and have greatly contributed to therichness of Western culture.The implications of such a program are considerable. If I am correctin my assessment that what we now call “esotericism” is the Other bywhich our modern Western identities have been constructed – accordingto the logic of an “orientalizing” grammar of identity/alterity – then the twodepend on each other and cannot exist alone. If dominant historical imagesof the Other turn out to be simplifications or distortions, then the parallelimages of ourselves – our basic identity – will have to be reconsideredand revised as well. How then will we define ourselves, and our essentialvalues, once the enemy or outcast that used to live in our imagination hasappeared in the flesh and even joined our own family? Will we use everytrick we can think of to prevent such a thing from happening? Will weallow it to happen, but find ourselves unable to live with him? Will weallow him to change us, or will we find ourselves changed without evenrealizing it? Will we accept him in our midst, and discover that someoneelse has taken the empty place in our collective imagination? Will that new"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Restoring memory379occupant perhaps look suspiciously like him? These are open questions,to which I have no answer.
