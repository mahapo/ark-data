Harrishas conveyed the point by entitling an essay “Science MustDestroy Religion.” His call to jihad cannot be long delayed.If science stands opposed to religion, it is not because ofanything contained in either the premises or the conclusionsof the great scientific theories. They do not mention a wordabout God. They do not treat of any faith beyond the one thatthey themselves demand. They compel no ritual beyond theusual rituals of academic life, and these involve nothing morethan the worship of what is widely worshipped. Confidentassertions by scientists that in the privacy of their chambersthey have demonstrated that God does not exist have nothingto do with science, and even less to do with God’s existence.In all this, two influential ideas are at work. The first isthat there is something answering to the name of science.The second is that something answering to the name of sci-ence offers sophisticated men and women a coherent visionof the universe. The second claim is false if the first claim is.And the first claim isfalse. Nothinganswers to the name ofscience.

The hypothesis that we are nothing more thancosmic accidents has been widely accepted by the scientificcommunity.

And for the same underlying rea-son: Why make trouble?When the great Austrian logician KurtGödel devised an interesting version of the ontological argu-ment, he showed it to friends and warned them that havingcreated an argument in favor of God’s existence, he was notabout to believe his own conclusions. He had merely beentesting the limits of his intellectual power. It is something,after all, that every man might wish to know.With the rise of what the Wall Street Journalhas called“militant atheism,” both the terms of debate and the climate ofopinion have changed. The sunny agnosticism character isticof men who believed that with respect to God, it could go ei-ther way, is no longer in fashion. It is regarded as rather dim.Some of this represents nothing more than the reappear-ance of that perennial literary character, the village atheist,someone prepared tediously to dispute the finer points of Sec-ond Corinthians in time taken from spring planting. A littlephilosophy, as Francis Bacon observed, “inclineth man’s mindto atheism.” A verylittle philosophy is often all that is needed.In a recent BBC program entitled A Brief History of Unbelief,the devil’s delusion29780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:55 AM Page 2"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the host, Jonathan Miller, and his guest, the philosopher ColinMcGinn, engaged in a veritable orgy of competitive skepti-cism, so much so that in the end, the viewer was left wonder-ing whether either man believed sincerely in the existence ofthe other.

To any-one having read Daniel Dennett’s Breaking the Spell: Religion asa Natural Phenomenon,these will appear as very considerablevirtues.If rural atheism is familiar, it is also irrelevant.

The title of Victor Stenger’s recent book is God: TheFailed Hypothesis—How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist.Stenger is a professor of physics. He may have written thebook, but it is science,we are to understand, that has providedthe requisite demonstration. Like a nineteenth-century spiritmedium, Stenger has simply taken dictation.

With forthcoming mod-esty, he has affirmed his willingness to defer to the world’s“smart scientists” on any matter more exigent than finger-counting.

He is presently persuadedthat “religion poisons everything.” His book is entitled God IsNot Great, and within its pages, he has managed to convey hiscontempt for religious thought by propositions exhibiting apositively oriental degree of evasiveness. “We do not rely solelyupon science and reason,” he writes, “because these are neces-sary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anythingthat contradicts science or outrages reason.” If Hitchens is notprepared to “rely solely upon science and reason,” why, onemight ask, should anyone else? And if science and reason are“necessary rather than sufficient factors,” then who is to saythat factors both necessary andsufficient might not convey aman to the very edge of faith? It is by means of these ques-tions, I imagine, that one day the lion shall lie down with thelamb, circumstances that with justifiable pride Hitchens mayaffirm that he has anticipated.2Does any of this represent anything more than yet anotherfoolish intellectual fad, a successor to academic Marxism, fem-inism, or various doctrines of multicultural tranquillity? Not inthe world in which religious beliefs overflow into action. ForIslamic radicals, “the sword is more telling than the book,” asthe Arab poet Abu Tammam wrote with menacing authoritysome eight hundred years ago. The advent of militant atheismmarks a reaction—a lurid but naturalreaction—to the violenceof the Islamic world.No Gods Before Me59780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:55 AM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"But the efflorescence of atheism involves more than athe-ism itself. Of course it does. Atheism is the schwerpunkt,asGerman military theorists used to say with satisfaction, theplace where force is concentrated and applied; and what liesbehind is a doctrinal system, a way of looking at the world,and so an ideology. It is an ideology with no truly distinct cen-ter and the fuzziest of boundaries. For purposes of propa-ganda it hardly matters. Science as an institution is unified bythe lowest common denominator of belief, and that is the con-viction that science is a very good thing.Curiously enough, for all that science may be a very goodthing, members of the scientific community are often dis-mayed to discover that, like policemen, they are not betterloved. Indeed, they are widely considered self-righteous, vain,politically immature, and arrogant. This last is considered aspecial injustice. “Contrary to what many anti-intellectualsmaintain,” the biologist Massimo Pigliucci has written, sci-ence is “a much more humble enterprise than any religionor other ideology.” Yet despite the outstandinghumility of thescien tific community, anti-intellectuals persist in their sullensuspicions. Scientists are hardly helped when one of theirchampions immerses himself in the emollient of his own en -thu siasm. Thus Richard Dawkins recounts the story of his pro-fessor of zoology at Oxford, a man who had “for years . . .passionately believed that the Golgi apparatus was not real.”On hearing during a lecture by a visiting American that hisviews were in error, “he strode to the front of the hall, shookthe devil’s delusion69780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:55 AM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"the American by the hand, and said—with passion—‘My dearfellow, I wish to thank you. I have been wrong these fifteenyears.’ ” The story, Dawkins avows, still has the power “tobring a lump to my throat.”It could not have been a very considerable lump. No simi-lar story has ever been recounted about Richard Dawkins.Quite the contrary. He is as responsive to criticism as a blackhole in space. “It is absolutely safe to say,” he has remarked,“that if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evo-lution that person is ignorant, stupid or insane.”The tone is characteristic. Peter Atkins is a professor ofphysical chemistry at Oxford University, and he, too, is ardentin his atheism. In the course of an essay denouncing not onlytheology but poetry and philosophy as well, he observes favor-ably of himself that scientists “are at the summit of knowl-edge, beacons of rationality, and intellectually honest.” It goeswithout saying, Atkins adds, that “there is no reason to sup-pose that science cannot deal with every aspect of existence.”Science is, after all, “the apotheosis of the intellect and theconsummation of the Renaissance.”These comical declarations may be abbreviated by observ-ing that Atkins is persuaded that not only is science a verygood thing, but no other thing is good at all.2Ever since the great scientific revolution was set in motion byJohannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and Isaac Newton, it has beenNo Gods Before Me79780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:55 AM Page 7"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"a commonplace of commentary that the more that scienceteaches us about the natural world, the less important a rolehuman beings play in the grand scheme of things. “Astronom-ical observations continue to demonstrate,” Victor Stengeraffirms, “that the earth is no more significant than a singlegrain of sand on a vast beach.” What astronomical observa-tions may, in fact, have demonstrated is that the earth is nomore numerousthan a single grain of sand on a vast beach. Sig-nificanceis, of course, otherwise. Nonetheless, the inference isplain: What holds for the earth holds as well for human be-ings. They hardly count, and scientists like Stenger are not dis-posed to count them at all. It is, as science writer Tom Bethellnotes, “an article of our secular faith that there is nothing ex -cep tional about human life.”The thesis that we are all nothing more than vehicles for anumber of “selfish genes” has accordingly entered deeply intothe simian gabble of academic life, where together with mate-rialism and moral relativism it now seems as self-evident asthe law of affirmative action.

It is hardly surprising that Moslemmathematicians and astronomers, from the late seventh to theearly fifteenth century, regarded their scientific curiosity, onthose occasions when they were called upon to justify it, as iftheir scientific pursuits comprised an exercise calculated toincrease their devotion.But of all the human emotions, curiosity is the one leastsubject to the general proscription against gluttony, and oncethe devil’s delusion149780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:55 AM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"engaged, even if engaged initially in the service of religion, ithas a tendency to grow relentlessly, until in the end the scholarbecomes curious about the nature of revelation itself. Themore encompassing the scope of scholarship, the more opento doubt the scholar becomes, so that in the end only curiosityremains indisputably of value. This is true whether the objectof curiosity is religion orscience.Writing in 1420 or 1430, the astronomer Ulugh Beg de -scribed science in a way that suggests nothing of the martyr’sblood. “Intellects are in agreement,” he wrote, “and mindsare in accord as to the excellence of science and the worthi-ness of scientists.” By “science,” Ulugh Beg meant observa-tion—the power of the eye, aided by various instruments, tosee.The benefits conferred by sight are very often matters ofself- improvement. “Science sharpens the intellect and strength -ens it; it increases sagacity, and augments perspicacity.” Butbenefits transcend the personal. Those sciences whose prin-ciples are “indisputable and self-evident” have the merit ofbeing “common to people of different religions,” Ulugh Begaffirmed.These sentiments are entirely modern. They might wellhave been expressed by a committee of the National ScienceFoundation. They wereexpressed by a committee of the Na -tional Science Foundation: “Science extends and enriches ourlives, expands our imagination and liberates us from the bondsof ignorance and superstition.” They are on display in everyhigh school textbook.Nights of Doubt159780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:55 AM Page 15"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"And there is hardly any reason to suppose them true.It is a point that did not fail to escape the notice of themost perceptive of the Arab philosophers, the gazelle,AbuHamid Muhammad Al-Ghazâli.

A complicated inference is set in play. Thenaturalists argue, he observes, that “intellectual power in manis dependent on [his] temperament.” It is a point that neuro-physiologists would today make by arguing that the mind (orthe soul) is dependent on the brain, or even that the mind isthe brain. From this it follows that “as the temperament is cor -rupted, intellect is also corrupted and ceases to exist.” When thebrain is destroyed, so, too, the mind. Death and disease markthe end of the mind. On the naturalistic view, Al Ghazâliargues, “the soul dies and does not return to life.” The globe ofconsciousness shrinks in each of us until it is no larger than aluminous point, and then it winks out.But if this is a matter of fact, Al Ghazâli argues, it is a mat-ter of profound scientific andmoral consequence.

Such secrets have beenrevealed to me that all I have written now appears to be oflittle value.”2Aquinas addresses the cosmological argument in Article 3 ofQuestion 2 of the first part of the Summa.Question 2 is called“The Existence of God,” and Article 3 asks the question whetherGod exists. Aquinas begins by offering a powerful and luciddefense of atheism.“It is superfluous to suppose,” Aquinas argues, “that whatcan be accounted for by a few principles has been produced bymany.” This constraint is now familiar as Occam’s Razor, eventhough William of Occam lived and wrote after Aqui nas’s death.“But it seems,” Aquinas at once adds, “that everything wesee in the world can be accounted for by other principles, sup-posing that God did not exist.”Otherprinciples?Just so. “All natural things can be reduced to one prin-ciple, which is nature, and all voluntary things can be reducedto one principle, which is human reason, or will.”the devil’s delusion669780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:55 AM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"It follows, Aquinas concludes provisionally, that “[t]hereis no reason to suppose God’s existence.”This is a conclusion that Aquinas is prepared to rejectwith all the force of his faith and genius.

It follows that not everything in naturecanbe ac counted for by “other principles.” The economies of thought offered by Occam’s Razor arean illusion.2We understand things in nature, Aquinas observes, bygrasping as best we can causes and their effects: the matchthat lights the fire, the chill that sets one’s teeth to chatter-ing, the water that slakes thirst. “In the world of sense,” asAquinas says, “there is an order of efficient causes.” Butjust as no man can be his own father, no effect can be itsown cause. A series of effects preceded by their causesforms a luminous meta phys ical trail going backward intothe past, because, as Aqui nas argues, causes must precedetheir effects.Can a series of this sort be infinitelycontinued, so that itsimply disappears into the loom of time?Aquinas argues that when it comes to causes, “it is notpossible to go on to infinity, because in all . . . causes followingin order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, andthe intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause.”The Cause679780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:55 AM Page 67"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"If a series of causes does not start, it cannot get going, andif it does not get going, then there will be no intermediatecauses, and if there are no intermediate causes, then over here,where we have just noticed that a blow has caused a bruise,there is no explanation for what is before our eyes. Eitherthere is a first cause or there is no cause at all, and since thereare causes at work in nature, there must be a first. The firstcause, Aquinas identified with God, because in at least one re -spect, a first cause exhibits an important property of thedivine: It is uncaused.This is a weak but not an absurd argument, and whileAquinas’s conclusion may not be true, objections to his argu-ment are frequently inept. Thus Richard Dawkins writes thatAquinas “makes the entirely unwarranted assumptionthatGod is immune to the regress.” It is a commonly made criti-cism.

Such a state is known as a singu-larity, and in the case of the cosmos it is known as the BigBang singularity.The cone tapering into the past must end. The lines ofsight converge. The universe had a beginning.2When the facts about an expanding universe became known,physicists at once realized that they had become known in theright place and at the right time. In 1915, Albert Einstein hadpublished his theory of general relativity.

Three of these numbers indicate where theevent is, and the fourth measures when it is there. Physicistsvery much enjoy suggesting that the world of four dimensionsis so inaccessible that entrance is generally denied the mathe-matically uninitiated. But although those four dimensions areimportant, the underlying concept is simple. After all, welocate an event in terms of both whereit took place and whenit took place. Where was JFK assassinated? Three numbersprovide the answer (longitude, latitude, and height). And when?One number is sufficient. To have grasped this much is to havegrasped everything. (And as long as secrets are being im parted,when physicists talk of ten-dimensional or eleven-dimensionalspaces, nothing deeper is at issue.) To a fused form of spaceand time in which points are identified by four numbers, Ein-stein assigned a variablegeometrical structure.

A beam of lightcrossing an otherwise empty universe travels in a straightline. If a massive star is placed in its path, the light beam willcurve, almost as if its graceful swerve were intended to avoida collision. By the same token, an observer falling toward theearth, his failed parachute dangling uselessly behind him andan ignominious plop forthcoming, is doing nothing more thantraveling along his natural path through space and time. Heappears to be accelerating because the earth has distorted thegeometry through which he is falling.Einstein’s theory of general relativity involves the cohabi-tation of these conceptual partners. Material objects influencespace and time by de form ing their geometry. Space and timeinfluence material objects by changing their path. The rela-tionship goes both ways.The field equation that Einstein introduced in 1915 is ama jestic identity in which curvature, on the one side, and mass,on the other, are placed in the balance and found equal. Ein-stein had hoped that the equations of general relativity woulddetermine a single world model, and like virtually every otherphysicist, he believed that his cosmic blueprint would reveal auniverse that had neither a beginning nor an end.

Friends of his who knew him well havesuggested (to me) that to the end of his life, Einstein regardedan expanding universe with a certain fastidious distaste.

The universe is every-thing that there is. What beyond nothing is left to explain itspromotion from inexistence to existence? This, Aquinas observes, is incoherent. Ex nihilo nihil fit.From nothing, nothing, as ancient writers said. Because it isimpossible to understand the emergence of something fromnothing, Aquinas concludes, something must have acted tobring the universe into existence. That something, the argu-ment continues, could have been contingent or necessary. Ifcontingent, we are no further advanced. We have simply chasedperplexities into the past. If not contingent, then necessary.When it comes to things that exist necessarily, it is wasteful toassume more than one. What could the others do?

If that is where thewave is, the particle enjoys a doubling of its position in space,with each position corresponding to a distinct physical state.Somehow both physical states are real and they are real at thesame time.

Their work will seem remarkably familiar toreaders who grasp the principle behind pyramid schemes ormagical acts in which women disappear into a box only toemerge as tigers shortly thereafter.Quantum mechanics of the old-fashioned kind assessesthe behavior of particles, chiefly by showing that particles arenot particles at all but a kind of probabilistic smear. In quan-tum cosmology, the particles are gone. Gone as well is theclassical form of Schrödinger’s equation, though its domesticcompanion, a wave function taking universesas its objects(more or less), also operates in terms of probabilities.Quantum cosmology dispenses with the Copenhagen in ter -pretation’s queer distinction between the quantum world andthe classical world, wherein the electron belongs to the quan-tum world, the physicist to the classical world.

Imagine that a cat has been placedin a sealed container, together with a device that ifit goes offwill kill it—a revolver, say, or some sort of radioactive pellet.Whetherthe device goes off is a matter of chance. So long as noone is looking, the cat exists in a superposition of quantumstates, at once half dead (the gun might fire) and half alive (itmight not). As soon as an observer peeks into the box, thatsuperposition gives way. That cat is either dead or alive andthere are no two ways about it. Schrödinger thought the ideaof a cat both alive and dead intellectually discouraging.Schrödinger’s cat is a part of the mythology of quantumtheory, and according to the Copenhagen interpretation, it isthere for the count, because no one can imagine how to get ridof the poor creature.For this reason any number of physicists have endeavoredto get rid of the Copenhagen interpretation instead. In 1957,Hugh Everett III, a young physicist at Princeton, argued in hisPh.D. dissertation that the collapse of the wave function couldbe explained on the assumption that reality somehow containsfar more worlds than previously imagined.

It appeals to those who believe in it,and it rewards belief in proportion to which belief is sincere.2The wave function of the universe is designed to represent thebehavior of the universe—all of it.It floats in the void—thesemetaphors are inescapable—and passes judgment on universes.Some are probable, others likely, and still others a very badbet. Nonetheless, the wave function of the universe cannot beseen, measured, assessed, or tested. It is purely a theoretical ar-ti fact. Physicists have found it remarkably easy to pass fromspeculation aboutthe wave function of the universe to the con-viction that there isa wave function of the universe. This isnothing more than an endearing human weakness. Less en-dearing by far is their sullen contempt toward religious argu-ment when it is engaged in precisely the same attempt to reachby speculation what cannot be grasped in any other way.By itself, the wave function of the universe can do little toadvance the double agenda of quantum cosmology: to get ridthe devil’s delusion1009780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 100"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"of the initial singularity of Big Bang cosmology, and to showhow the universe emerged from nothing much or nothing atall.

The new look is necessary because, as StephenHawking and Roger Penrose demonstrated in the mid-1960s,the Big Bang singularity is simply unavoidable. Within gen-eral relativity, time has an unvarying direction. If a man is go -ing down toward the Big Bang, it is one thing beforean other,and if he is coming up from the Big Bang, one thing afteranother. This is a feature of the real number system itself. Itcannot be changed. Within quantum cosmology, however, timehas been altered. Very much like a physician who proposes tocure his patient’s infection by infecting him with anotheraffliction, Hawking suggested that in going down toward theBig Bang, one mathematical regime (that of the real numbers)would somehow give way to another (that of the imaginarynumbers).It was the use of the word imaginaryin this context thatgave his ideas their air of pontifical mystification. How cannumbers be imaginary? They cannot be. Hawking was simplyappealing to the complex numbers, and these are perfectlywell-defined mathematical objects. They correspond more orless to pairs of points in the plane.The complex numbers have one outstanding advantage:The Reason1019780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 101"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"They are not ordered.

As the physicist descends toward the place for-merly known as the Big Bang singularity, time smoothly exe-cutes a transformation all its own, the region around the tipbecoming gently curved, so that the cone ends in a penduloussac.

This was widely considered avery fine thing.There followed an illumination, one that lit up all of par-ticle physics. Working very much in isolation, the physicistsJoël Scherk and John Schwarz observed that string theory, no matter how manipulated, seemed to predict the existenceof a new particle, something like the photon. This seemeduncalled for and therefore unwanted, until physicists real-ized that amid all those twitching strings, a particle hadappeared conveying the force of gravity. For the first time, afundamental theory in particle physics incorporated a long-missing force. A grand unification seemed to be at hand, oneinvolving allnature’s forces. No theory could be more final—or more desired—than this.From that moment on, a number of physicists had therarest of all experiences: They came to believe that they couldhear Nature herself knocking at their door.2In the years that followed—roughly from the late 1970s untilthe present—string theory expanded and grew great.

In The Trou-ble with Physics,written by Lee Smolin, and Not Even Wrong,by Peter Woit, string theory was examined with some sympa-thy and found wanting. Neither author could find a theory inthe place where theoreticians said a theory should be, andboth authors noted with some asperity that string theory hadno apparent connections to experiment and that none were inprospect. Woit went so far as to observe that the mathematicalstructure on which the theory rested, far from being a thing ofgreat elegance, was the most horrible thing he had ever seen.2Whatever their other merits, all string theories are character-ized by an embarrassing dimensional overflow. Some versionsof string theory require twenty-six dimensions; others, ten;and still others, eleven. Our own universe contains only threeor four, but in any case, no more than a handful.

As one might easily imagine, the con flict betweenthe demands of theory—Get me those extra dimensions—and theconstraints of common sense—No extra di men sions here, Boss,and we looked—was not easily resolved.In the end, string theorists argued that the extra dimen-sions of their theory were buried somewhere. At each point inspace and time, they conjectured, thereone would find a tinygeometrical object known as a Calabi-Yau manifold, and curledup within, thereone would find the extra dimensions of stringtheory itself.It was an idea that possessed every advantage except clar-ity, elegance, and a demonstrated connection to reality.With extra dimensions buried, stable solutions emergedfrom the equations of string theory, just as the physicists hadhoped. They were not, unfortunately, unique. There were thou -sands of them, and each led to a different version of the theory,a point in an enormous space of possibilities, a landscape of asort never seen before, a place where each point seemed to em-body a different scheme of physical thought, and so a differentuniverse governed by the scheme.

One universehaving proved inadequate, more would be required. Endeav-oring to unify the forces of nature, physicists determined tomultiply the universes in which they were satisfied. Very fewphysicists appreciated the irony involved in pursuing the firstambition by embracing the second. The physicist LeonardSuss kind thus claimed that “the narrow 20th-century view of aunique universe, about ten billion years old and ten billion lightyears across with a unique set of physical laws, is giving wayto something far bigger and pregnant with new possibilities.”Far bigger? And pregnant too? In service to this idea, Suss -kind wrote that “physicists and cosmologists are coming tosee our ten billion light years as an infinitesimal pocket of astu pendous megaverse.” On reflection, Susskind came to under -stand that the word megaversecarried negative class associa-tions, as in mega-blockbuster (a movie no one wishes to see) ormega-mall (a place no one wishes to go), whereupon he re-named the megaverse “the Landscape.”the devil’s delusion1209780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 120"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Landscape at once suggested the radical changes tocome. “Theoretical physicists,” Susskind wrote, “are proposingtheories which demote our ordinary laws of nature to a tinycomer of a gigantic landscape of mathematical possibilities.” Each of the versions of string theory is thus free to find itshome in some particular universe. Like Odysseus worshippingin foreign temples, there is a universe in which a very large cos-mological constant is made to feel welcome. The MIT physi-cist Max Tegmark is persuaded that this is so, and if in someuniverse he is persuaded that it is not so, he has learned toaccept the emotional incoherence that would trouble otherswith equanimity.However named, the Landscape was a provocative, andeven a revolutionary idea. Physicists appreciate revolutionsfor obvious reasons: They stir the blood. “We may be at a newturning point, a radical change in what we accept as a legiti-mate foundation for a physical theory,” Steven Weinbergwrote. It would be hard to imagine a doctrine more radicalthan the thesis that when it comes to universes, there are agreat many of them. At a conference on string theory held in2005, Weinberg buoyantly indicated that he was prepared towelcome his new insect overlords. An informal poll indicated that the audience of physicistsrejected his views by a margin of four to one.“We win some and we lose some,” Weinberg remarkedequably.

During the 1980s, the physicist Alan Guth argued that theearly universe was characterized by a period of exponentialinflation. Very soon after it blew up in the first place, it blewup again. When suitably blown up, it stopped blowing up. TheStanford physicist André Linde carried this idea a step furtherin his theory of eternal chaotic inflation.

It consists,when analyzed, of two quite separate claims. The first is a matter of common sense. If the universe hadnot admitted the creation of observers at some stage, why,then, we would not be here.The second is a claim about the facts of life. If we are sur-prised by a universe in which we have been given what weneed, some part of that surprise, Carter argued, represents aform of bad faith.

Onthe other hand, there are the universes in which they are sat-isfied, strange, remote, distant, unrecoverable. Physicists veryoften write as if in the crucible of creation, universes were for-ever pullulating, red-eyed and throbbing with energy. Perhapsthis is so. Who am I to say?

Just how does a theory get hold of a universe in orderto control its birth, formation, and development? It must do that, because in the end this is just what a the-ory does, and if it does not do it, then nothing in the Land-scape is explained by anything.

If He is not, how can He create things? And if He is, then(being one of those things), He is incapable (without self-creation) of creating the mass of bodily forms.”This argument is exquisite because it is short.

Childish questions have their point, and in the case ofGod’s existence, their point is to place in doubt some of theintellectual maneuvers by which His existence is affirmed.Doubt is very much a matter of temperament. It is rarelyen couraged (or displaced) by argument. For certain tempera-ments, the existence of the universe is a mystery, one thatgnaws irritably at the soul. Why isthe damn thing there? Thethought that it is there for no good reason is said by someto spoil their enjoyment of life. In time taken from writing,hunting, estate management, and fornication, Leo Tolstoy veryoften expressed sentiments such as this. Like Levin in AnnaKarenina,he was widely regarded as a pest for doing so. On theother hand, a great many men and women take the universein stride, and if they are disposed to ask why it is there, theyare easily pleased with the answer that the physicist (and Nobellaureate) Frank Wilczek insouciantly offered: “The universe,”he wrote, “appears to be just one of those things.” A willingnessto let the matter rest in this way is a character istic of individualsthat William James described as “healthy-minded”—anotherway of describing them as thick.Of course, if physicists can believe that the universe is justA Curious Proof That God DoesNotExist1399780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 139"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"one of those things, then believers can affirm that God is justone of those things as well.

A God too indisposed to dothe work of creation is fated to drift into irrelevance, if onlybecause His demand for adoration would be considerably outof line with His record of accomplishment. But if God didcre-ate the world, the problem that God is designed to solve reap-pears as a problem about God Himself.It is this destructive dilemma that Dawkins calls the Ulti-mate Boeing 747 gambit.

In these, Dawkins extends a convivial pseu do-pod toward the concepts of complexity and information. Underthe influence of these concepts, Dawkins often writes thatunless God is Himself complex, He is bound to be inadequateto account for the complexity of the universe.

It is as difficult, the Bible recounts, for a richman to enter the kingdom of heaven as it is for him to passthrough the eye of a needle; and if it is that difficult, I supposeit is that improbable.

The power assumptiontrails in its wake two additional assumptions. The first is thatold standby: The universe is unlikely. And the second has longstood by:IfGod created the universe, He must be more un likelythan the universe He created. From the power assumption andits sidekicks, an infinite regress very quickly arises, one inwhich God requires an explanation, which in turn triggers thedemand for yet another explanation, and so another God.It follows that if God created the universe, there are Godsstacked up behind him, each one creating the God below.the devil’s delusion1489780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 148"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Either we must give up on him (formerly Him) or we need toget to the God who really gets things going, and since thereseems by this argument to be infinitely many of them, eachpresumably more powerful, and certainly more intimidating,than His Subordinates, this is an inquiry guaranteed either tofail or to lead to a revival of an especially vigorous form ofpolytheism.Imagine addressing prayers to our fatherswhich art inheaven, as in one of those ghastly children’s books in whichHeather has three mothers and Jamal a dozen fathers.Depressing, no?The demand that explanations mention only events nomore improbable than the events they explain is in any caseintolerably ab ste mi ous. “How often have I said to you,” Sher-lock Holmes ob served to Watson, “that when you have elimi-nated the im pos sible, whatever remains, however improbable,must be the truth?”But if we explain an event by an appeal to an improbableevent, it does not follow that we are bound to keep clamberingup the ladder of an infinite regress.

King andWilson went on to suggest that the morphological and behav-ioral differences between humans and the apes, if they werenot due to variations between their genomes, must be due tovariations in their genomic regulatory systems. These are thesystems that control the activities of the genes by telling vari-ous genes when to sound off and when to shut up.

Using nothing more than ink,paper, and the resources of mathematical logic, Turing man-aged to create an imaginary machine, one capable of incarnat-ing a very smooth, very suave imitation of the human mind.Known now as a Turing machine, the device has at its dis-posal a tape divided into squares, and a reading head mountedover the tape. It has, as well, a finite number of physical sym-bols. The reading head may occupy one of a finite number ofdistinct physical states.And thereafter the repertoire of its action is extremelylimited.

Thefirst: the theory makes little sense. The second: it is supportedby little evidence. In his very long posthumous treatise, TheStructure of Evolutionary Theory, Stephen Jay Gould ex plained“the bare bones” of natural selection in this way: “Organismsenjoying differential reproductive success will, on aver age, bethose variants that are fortuitously better adapted to changinglocal environments.” Those variants that are “better adapted”are, of course, precisely those “enjoying differential reproduc-tive success.” What else could they be?

Of course they do.As one might expect, a theory whose assumptions areempty may be widely confirmed by evidence whose relevanceis negligible. Just how and when do spe cies arise? The stan-dard view throughout much of the twentieth century has beenthat geographical barriers, such as a mountain range or anopen body of water, are necessary to force an ancestral popu-lation to diverge. In a study reported in the November 20, 2007, edition ofScience Daily,Vicki Friesen, a professor of biology, observed:“While that model fits for many parts of the natural world, itdoesn’t explain why some species appear to have evolved sepa-rately, within the same location, where there are no geographicMiracles in Our Time1879780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 187"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"barriers to gene flow.” And, indeed, some species haveevolvedseparately within the same location.

In Origins,Darwin him self argued for justthis possibility. I have every confidence in Dr. Friesen’s research and noway in which to dispute it. I am not about to investigate theband-rumped storm petrel. It is her conclusion that must givepause. It is “exciting,” she affirms, “to be able to verify Dar-win’s original theory!” But no theoryhas been confirmed since every possibilityhas been justified. Speciation proceeds in the presence of geo-graphic barriers, and it proceeds in their absence. The de -mand that the facts somehow support the theory may thus betreated as it so often is in Darwinian thought, and that is as aninconvenience.If the facts are what they are, the past is what it is—profoundly enigmatic. The fossil record may be used to justifyvirtually any position, and often is. There are long eras inwhich nothing happens. The fire alarms of change then go offin the night. A detailed and continuous record of transitionbetween speciesis missing, those neat sedimentary layers, asGould noted time and again, never revealing precisely the phe-nomena that Darwin proposed to explain.

We must look elsewhere for an account thatdoes justice to their nature or to the facts.Although Darwin depicted natural selection as a force“daily and hourly scrutinizing” the biological world—a de scrip-tion that would equally designate the activities of the HolyGhost—efforts to measurenatural selection have been remark-ably unforthcoming.

Withinthis world, a shifting population of computer organisms meet,mate, mutate, and reproduce.Sandra Blakeslee, writing for the New York Times,reportedthe results under the headline “Computer ‘Life Form’ Mutatesin an Evolution Experiment: Natural Selection Is Found atWork in a Digital World.”Natural selection found at work?

But if it isso, it rep-resents a connection that we do not understand and cannotgrasp. The gap is too great.

His letter is a great soulfulcry, a plea for tolerance and freedom of inquiry.

Andthis suggests that such texts express propositions that not onlyare true, but could not be false.Now, Galileo’s scientific career was, if nothing else, a mat-ter of demonstrating that in certain fundamental respects, theancient and subtle Ptolemaic system, according to which theheavens revolved around the earth in a series of celestialspheres, was mistaken. But the Ptolemaic account wasthe bib-lical account. It was, in fact, the account common in the an -cient Near East, where only the Greeks were daring enough tospeculate that the earth might be in motion around the sun,and even the Greeks were unable to reconcile this thesis withthe plain evidence of their senses.

An irresistible force had encounteredan immovable object.The friction thus engendered, Galileo proposed to amelio-rate by means of a semantic dodge. “Although the scripturescannot err,” he wrote, “nevertheless some of its interpretersand expositors can err in various ways.” Such errors typicallyinvolve the confusion of metaphorical and literal meaning.Taken literally, scriptures would seem to assign to God “feet,hands and eyes,” and this, Galileo assumes, is quite absurd,although he makes this assumption by means of no argument.Moslem theologians of the tenth century had, after all, arguedthe contrary with great heat and no little eloquence.There then follows a passage of quite extraordinary im -por tance, one that has worked its way through every part ofour own scientific and secular culture: “Thus given that theScripture is not only capable but necessarily in need of in ter -pre tation different from the apparent meaning of [its] words,it seems to me that in disputes about natural phenomena, itshould be reserved to the last place.” This opinion, althoughprovocative in the context of seventeenth-century thought,is today uncontroversial. The sentences that follow are other-wise: “For the Holy Scripture and Nature both equally de -rive from the divine Word, the former as the dictation of theHoly Spirit, the latter as the most obedient executrix of God’scommands.” Although inspired by the Holy Spirit, scripturesbe long to the world of appearances,and appearances can becon fused or misleading.

But the bookcannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehendthe language and read the alphabet in which it is composed.”From this remarkable declaration, it follows that Nature isa book; and from what Galileo has already written, it followsthat “nature never transgresses the terms of the laws imposedupon her.”These assertions imply that the Book of Nature is in errant,so that the doctrine of biblical inerrancy, a staple of Christianthought, has not at all been discarded in Galileo’s mind, buttransferred.A new, greater, grander book now occupies hisattention, but even though new, greater, and grander, the Bookof Nature—theBook—is nonetheless very much like the oldbook. It is inerrant.The “book of God’s word” and the “book of God’s works,”Francis Bacon argued, are not in conflict.The Cardinal and His Cathedral2139780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 213"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"How could they be?They are the samebook.2Hearing that unorthodox opinions were afoot, a Dominican,Niccolò Lorini, expressed his scruples in a letter written onFebruary 7, 1615, to Cardinal Paolo, prefect of the Holy Officein Rome.

Let us say that this is so. “There is in this,” thecardinal allows, “nothing dangerous.”But to go further into the frank affirmation that the sunreally isimmovable and the earth really isin motion—this,Bel lar mine declares, “isa very dangerous thing.”Sixteen years before, Bellarmine had served the Churchas an inquisitor at the trial of Giordano Bruno, one of history’slamentable pests, and Bruno had been burned at the stake,Cardinal Bellarmine approving the verdict and having donenothing to prevent its execution. When written by a man pre-pared to put other men to death, the words very dangeroushave a force they might not otherwise possess. The cardinal,one imagines, has caught Foscarini’s attention.“Whenever a true demonstration would be produced thatthe sun stands at the center of the world”—and none has beenvouchsafed me, the cardinal is quick to affirm—“then at thatthe devil’s delusion2169780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 216"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"time it would be necessary to proceed with great caution ininterpreting Scriptures which seem to be contrary.”This is so very reasonable as to place in doubt the veryidea of clerical intolerance. Bellarmine is arguing, after all,only that in matters of astronomy, judgment might be sus-pended and notthat inquiry must be stopped.But suppose, the cardinal continues, the conflict betweenastronomical fact and Holy Scripture should prove irremedia-ble; suppose, in fact, that a demonstration—not a conjecture,not an assumption, not one of these, please forgive me, YourReverence, amusingsuppositions that are so prominently afeature of your letter—were made available that the sun isin factimmovable.Yes, suppose just that.The cardinal now contemplates this appalling possibilitywith all his intellectual sophistication. If it came to that, hewrites—if the sun really does stand still—“it would be better tosay that we do not understand Holy Scripture than to say thatwhat has been demonstrated is false.”But this is, of course, precisely what Galileo had urged—a grand, quite self-conscious project of avoiding conflict byfeign ing confusion.2The passionate drama played out four hundred years ago isplaying out again.

A paperpublished recently in the Proceedings of the Biological Societyof Washington DCconcluded that the so-called Cambrian ex-plosion, the sudden appearance of new life forms about 530million years ago, could best be understood in terms of an intel-ligent design—hardly a position unknown in Western thought.The paper was, of course, peer-reviewed by three prominentevolutionary biologists. Wise men attend to the publication ofevery one of the Proceedings’ papers, but in the case of StephenMeyer’s “The Origin of Biological Information and the HigherTaxonomic Categories,” the Board of Editors was at once givento understand that they had done a bad thing. Their indecentcapitulation followed at once.Publication of the paper, they confessed, was a mistake. Itwould never happen again. It had barely happened at all.“If scientists do not oppose antievolutionism,” remarkedEugenie Scott, the executive director of the National Center forScience Education, “it will reach more people with the mis -taken idea that evolution is scientifically weak.” Scott’s under-standing of “opposition” had nothing to do with reasoneddiscussion. It had nothing to do with reason at all. Discussingthe issue was out of the question. Her advice to her colleagueswas considerably more to the point: “Avoid debates.”There is nothing surprising in any of this.

If he is on those occasions useful in virtue of the sliverof pure steel running through his character, his usefulnessis circumscribed by his quivering intelligence. Stern as a de -fender of the faith, he is, in his heart of hearts, a witness to itslimitations.The cardinal speaks today to those whose faith is sincerebut whose doubts are significant. He speaks for me,and I sup-pose that in seeing something sympathetic in the cardinal,I have in return spoken for him.No less than other men, the cardinal understands that inthe twenty-first century, the symbol and the glory of faith isthe cathedral that science has constructed from its great phys-ical theories. The thing is immense. It can be seen from everyvantage point, and even those ill at ease in its presence cannotescape its shadow.But the cathedral is now some four hundred years old. Thewalls have aged into ocher and umber. Within, statues of all thesaints stand on their pedestals. Newton is there, noble, uncor-rupted, and aloof; and so, too, Clerk Maxwell, Albert Ein stein,Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrö dinger, Max Born,and Paul Dirac; Richard Feynman is the last. There are no oth-ers. There are noyoung saints and none have been proposed.The Cardinal and His Cathedral2219780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 221"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"With a peasant smile of satisfaction creasing his narrowItalian face, the cardinal very much enjoys the grand spectaclethat every day takes place within the cathedral and on theplaza on which it has been built. There are architects carryingrolled-up designs under their arms, masons stirring wet loadsof cement, bricklayers, and carpenters; and hanging like mon-keys from their scaffolds, stonecutters carving out gargoyleson all the high ledges.But the cathedral is not finished. The interiors are crudelyappointed. While some windows glow in subtle colors, othershave been put in place before they have been stained, and insome parts of the great vault, simple pine boards have beennailed onto window frames still lacking any windows at all.Although workmen speaking any number of languagesmay be seen every day on the cathedral’s work site, there is acertain disorganization to their affairs. It is hardly surprising,given the fact that almost every worker belongs to a separateguild. Guild officials have been known to bring work to a haltover the most trivial of circumstances.When the cathedral was first proposed many long yearsago, the great visionaries imagined a single unified and com-pelling structure, its massive walls embracing a serene volumeof space and light, its flanks ascending smoothly upward so thata slender spire emerged naturally to pierce the sky. Sketches ofthe original cathedral may still be found in the cathedral’sbasement, where mice have taken over all the filing cabinets.The spire has not been built, and in the clear moonlight,the devil’s delusion2229780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 222"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"the cathedral looks unbalanced, almost as if it were a crippledefiantly waving a stump against the sky. The rumor is cur-rent among knowledgeable architects that from the first, thecathedral was constructed from incompatible blueprints.The towers do not quite match. One is austere and clas -sical. The other ornamented and baroque.How was this overlooked?At the very top of the cathedral, where the spire is in tendedto pierce the sky, but where only a small stub now ex ists, work-men have put down their tools. They do not know how toproceed. The architects are of little help. They consult theirdrawings, but the more their drawings occupy their attention,the less they are able to determine what they mean.The cardinal longs to see the spire finished, thrust into thesky gleaming, so that hecan step back and see it soar.But the spire presents any number of difficult problems.Some of them are financial. Like every cathedral, this one issupported by public funds. Very often, the cardinal finds him-self pleading for money before various church groups. It is arole he finds distasteful. Who would not?There is dissension among the architects. Some now arguefor a spire that is taller than the one planned; others for onethat is shorter. And some believe that it should remain an idea,one that all men can see, without ever being translated intostone.Catching himself in these visions of grandeur, the cardinalreminds himself that cathedrals have been known to collapse,The Cardinal and His Cathedral2239780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 223"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"and in thinking of the weight of the faith he has invested inthe cathedral, he wonders—it is only natural—whether anystructure can support such weight.Although a visionary, the cardinal is also a practical man.He believes in costs and is apprehensive about expenses. Adesign should really be tested by experiment. The architectshave said so. But the spire is projected to weigh tons and costmillions.How couldit be tested?And if it could be tested, by what means could the test betested?What a question, the cardinal reflects. How can faith betested? What isits test?To discontinue work on the cathedral is unthinkable, thecardinal reflects, but even he does not know whether the spirewill ever be built. No one is sure. It is possible that the cathe-dral will foreverremain incomplete.Every now and then careless tourists with no sense of itsweight in history dismiss the cathedral as so much antiquestone. What is its point? They snap pictures, and they are gone.How little they understand.But doesthe cathedral have a point?Standing before the cathedral to which he has devoted hislife, the cardinal says at least this to himself: that it has givenmeaning to those who have worked on it, and satisfaction tothose who worship in its dim interior.No one could bear its loss. It has become a monument, andthe devil’s delusion2249780465019373-text:Berl_9780307396266_5p_01_r1 7/10/09 9:56 AM Page 224"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"when from the plaza the professional beggars and sly trades-men and rouge-lipped prostitutes look up, they see that greatloomingfamiliarthing, as natural as the space that containsit and the space that it contains.From time to time, the cardinal allows himself to be ques-tioned by the faithful. He is courteous, polite, and reserved.But he is distant.“Your Eminence,” they ask in every language of the world,“does our cathedral support the faith by which it is supported?”The cardinal smiles enigmatically, a sly, ironic, distant, ten -der smile.
