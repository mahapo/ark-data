Why? How are we to believe in such a supposition? Are the Secret Chiefs real or just some Occult superstition working out of a fad in 19th Theosophical circles? In essence, we answered this question in the first volume of this tome. The energy that flows down from the Divine into us and by which we emulate the Divine and radiate ourselves, it is this energy that informs us and all our thought and intuitions are of it, as that is how it manifests in our minds. Based on the ‘key of it all’ prophesied in Liber AL and discovered by Frater Achad, this book attacks one of Liber AL’s most intriguing riddles; the discovery of the order and value of the English alphabet. Contained herein is proof that true spiritual research is still alive and that somebody is listening to the changing rhythm of the universal dance. Even better still, the book begs for further effort and even more in-depth research. It reaches across AL and transcends any specific religious tradition in this regard and asks only that one understand the English language and its subtle nuances. The language itself is living and evolving unlike other holy tongues; i.e.: Hebrew, Latin, Sanskrit, et al...all of which are dead and frozen in the past. The English Alphabet is inherently of vital importance, as it frames our epistemological view of the Universe and of the Goddess herself. The energies manifested by the reception of Liber AL are as an obeah and wanga in their integral relation; and their daemonic representations must be found in the English Language, as AL clearly implies. From there of course, all the Holy Books of Thelema must find further expurgation for the deriving of our cultural paradigm. And to that end, we must find this working in context with a rich and multi-cultural community; that it speaks to all of them after the manner or their own evolving metaphysic. This new Gnosis has come about organically by way of the work of several minds; that the Secret Chiefs speak to many, if they have but the ears and open minds. And so it is larger than any one of us in particular, as it should be. Originally growing out of the work of Paul Joseph Rovelli and Marc Cohen, it came to include the efforts of Joshua Zintel. The latter two eventually split off on their own and continued the effort in one direction as the former developed a new line, which first attracted another who was inspired enough to send me a calculation of all the words in Liber AL. Shortly thereafter, Ryan Higgins and Paul David Thomas greatly expanded the effort. And finally, adding to all dynamic nature of it all, along comed Edward Nichols with a whole new twist. May there be many more!...that the purity of our current be constantly renewed!!! "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Liber 805 vel EQ sub figura xiii Introduction I have often wondered whether or not the number seven (an important part of the Seal of the A.’.A.’.) would be sacred had we known about Uranus, Neptune and Pluto all those aeons ago. And I still sometimes wonder what would the whole scheme have been had our solar system been composed in an entirely different manner...or for that matter, how well it would hold up should humanity find itself emigrating to other planets and solar systems. This seems to provide something of an answer in Pythagoras' commentary that the number would remain sacred; no matter that \"nine and ninety-nine other planets [be] discovered.\" Together this adds to 108, which has its own significance; cf. my article: Gnostic Cycles, wherein I write: Note also that the Aeon of Aquarius will start in 2597ev when the Earth’s ‘Vernal Point’ will for the first time, be in Aquarius, 693 years after the revelation of Liber AL vel Legis! And the Sun will find alignment with the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, symbolized by the Nile in the Egyptian Gnosis in 2012ev, 108 years after the start of the Aeon of Horus. 108 of course, reduces to 9 by AIQ BKR but more interestingly is thrice 23, which is why 108 is usually the number of beads on a rosary; a hint back to the Rosicrucian truth and it is also the number of beads on the Mala that Yoga students wear. The reduction to 9 then also becomes a key to the nature of our Solar System. And as will be shown, a key to the nature of the present Manifestation, which is ruled by Sagittarius. Also 23=6 or Tiphareth or the Sun. Note the Sun (6) is 93 million miles from the Earth; another recursion of 693. The diameter of the Sun is also about 108 times the Earth's diameter and the distance between the Earth and Moon is about 108 times the Moon's diameter. Having come upon the Order & Value given here, there is much that made itself obvious, which makes it so very numinous. Particularly, its connection w/Achad’s solution is too significant to ignore. But one doubt consistently remained that was as nagging as it was incontrovertible. Liber Trigrammaton is the Order & Value prescribed and prophesied in Liber AL vel Legis. AL II.55: \"Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto.\" And Crowley writes in his commentary: The attribution in Liber Trigrammation is good theoretically; but no Qabalah of merit has arisen therefrom. With Motta’s appendage: (Surely it is a little early for that; a good Qabalah may take a few hundred years to unfold.) In a dialogue I had with a sincere, Thelemic Qabalist, I was shown how Liber Trigrammaton was the correct fulfillment of this verse and that Crowley was the one to “find” these “new symbols”. But per Crowley’s own admission, “no Qabalah of merit has arisen.” And so it seems something"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"is amiss. Then a student of mine takes it upon himself to do his own research into this conundrum. Noting my use of the number 108, I am presented with the following astounding result: This is very interesting; since it ties in with my recent reflections on Liber Trigrammaton. The three cubed gives us 27, the number of verses in Liber AL required to derive the English Qabalah. It is also the number of Trigrams used in Trigrammaton. If we consider Liber Trigrammaton as a possible basis for a Thelemic Book of Hermes comprising the paths on a Thelemic tree of Life, it may be that 108 as expressed as 2 squared x three cubed expresses the archetypes of the Thelemic gnosis (Trigrammaton) multiplied and manifested through the structures of matter, i.e. 2. squared, =4 x 3 cubed = 9 portrays the squaring of the circle, due to the circular nature of nine. Also 27 is 9x3 which is 93 or 39, hence the connection between the EQ and the half of the Jews, via Hebrew Qabalah. Also 27 is the Thrasraq of 72, Shemhamphorash, the divided name of the Hebrew qabalah, also the zodiac, chokmah, thus the archetypes of the creative word.  Making the connection between the English Qabalah and Liber Trigrammaton is sublime, simple and beautiful. And note, Crowley was not to discover or find the Order & Value, but the symbols; the Order & Value was to be given to him. This was really not done. There are enough proofs in place to suggest that this gift is being offered posthumously. Symbols of the English Alphabet “Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto.” AL II.55 ‘Thou’ can mean the universe itself known to us as Nuit (Not-I but Thou). And because of this such verbal axioms as they creep into collective culture become significant. These symbols come to us from the collective unconscious of English speaking peoples. In particular, the American English as it is America that holds the Eagle of truth. And the order that we will find for the letters even comes from the first chapter (Nuit) of the Book of the Law as “Thou shalt obtain the order” and “Thou” is Nuit. Further, in the English Qabalah put forth in the present work, ‘Thou’ equals 55 and is the mystic number of 10, which represents the totality of experience as delineated by the 10 Sephiroth contained in the Tree-of-Life. The only Qabalah that tradition has handed to us as whole and complete is the Hebrew Qabalah. Yes, there are other Qabalah’s; the Greek and Enochian come to mind. But none other than the Hebrew Qabalah has heretofore been so thoroughly explored and utilized. And one of the first things that a beginning Qabalist is taught in the Western Mystery Tradition, is the meanings of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. There must also be symbols that are attributed to the letters of the English alphabet as alluded to in AL II.55. Well, this has already manifested by virtue of the collective consciousness of English speaking people if we but take a moment to think about it. These symbols have evolved in our culture over time and have become quite fixed in our consciousness. In HPB's commentary to Stanza 4, Verse 4 of her Secret Doctrine, she quotes P. Christian, \"the learned author of Histoire de la Magie and L'Homme Rouge des Tuileries\" with words that most clearly show the power of words, symbols and letters: When our soul [mind] creates or evokes a thought, the representative sign of that thought is self-engraved upon the astral fluid, which is the receptacle and, so to say, the mirror of all the manifestations of being. The sign expresses the thing; the thing is the [hidden or occult] virtue of the sign. To pronounce a word is to evoke a thought, and make it present: the magnetic potency of human speech is the commence3ment of every manifestation in the Occult World. To utter a Name is not only to define a Being [an Entity], but to place it under, and condemn it through the emission of the Word [Verbum] to the influence of one or more Occult potencies. Things are, for every one of us, that which it [the Word]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"makes them while naming them. The Word [Verbum] or the speech of every man is, quite unconsciously to himself, a blessing or a curse; this is why our present ignorance about the properties and attributes of the idea, as well as about the attributes and properties of matter, is often fatal to us. Yes, names [and words] are either beneficent or maleficent; they are in a certain sense, either venomous or health-giving, according to the hidden influences attached by Supreme Wisdom to their elements, that is to say, to the letters which compose them, and the numbers correlative to these letters. What follows is a compilation of these symbols in the traditional order of the English letters: A - One, Excellence, First, Beginning, Most Important, Initiation, Scarlet Letter, Anti-oxidents (such as Beta Carotene), Answer B - Alternative, Drill (as in spelling ‘Bee’; which is the letter ‘B’ in its full spelling; or even fire drill--practice.), vitamins for the brain, to ‘be’ or exist, a bumble bee. C - Average, Middle of the Road, Mediocre, Lowest Common Denominator, vitamin found in orange juice. D - Below Average, Dunce, vitamin found in milk and in sunlight. E - Effort, Energy (E=MC2), vitamin for skin and hair. F - Failure (Lunar in nature as fear and failure surround as taboos; also the menstruum as a failed or potential pregnancy), abbreviation for the word Fuck (which is already an anagram ‘for unlawful carnal knowledge). G - Sigh (Gee whiz), to aspire H – Breath, Ladder I - Self, Eye (shape of this letter suggests the Tower or 'Eye of Horus' in Tower Atu) J - Improper Move (J-Walking), Jail (J-bird), Marijuana (cigarettes are referred to as J’s). K - Strike or Knock Out (as in KO) L - Perpendicular, Corner—angle/perspective. M - Wave, tidal ebb and flow; delicious (MMM) or note of recognition, vibration (mantra), Mystery. N - Answer or Sum (1+2=n) O - Gasp (O my heavens!); Hail (O Thou...), Orgasm/Ecstasy (Orgone), Whole or complete circle or cycle. ‘Hug’ as used in a closing to a leter P - Excrete (discharge of energy or by-product of innermost self) or Anger (as in Piss Off; in England); Drunk; also Pea is a part of English currency); Legume Q - Total Capacity (I.Q.), Question R - Existence (‘are’); Rudimentary Knowledge (3 R’s) S - Curve or double U-turn, ($) Currency; snake with corresponding symbolism; Superman (hence the ‘Overman of Nietzche). T - Intersection; Square, World of the Elements, Time Out (in athletic competition), Light (as in the Cross) U - Reverse Direction (U-turn); Not-I, Pictorial representation of the open womb. V - Victory; Peace (to the British it is not a Peace sign but an insult), Penis pointing down, Vow. W - Audience (double ‘Not-I’) X - Remove; Discontinue; Variable or Product (as in Algebra), Chromosome, Axis point. ‘Kiss’ as used in the closing of a letter. Y - Question; Choice [fork in the road], Chromosome, Axis point. Z - Zig-zag; End; Sleep; lightening flash (which is also a symbol for orgasm). The Reader should clearly be able to link these symbols with the collective associations that are given to their corresponding letters. But there is herein no direct clue to any numerical value, which seems to have been the research of all the primary English Qabalists to date. Aleister Crowley would be the one exception to this with his publication of Liber Trigrammaton. However, he concludes that this does not lead to a working Qabalah. So the next test is to see whether or not these symbols have any intrinsic worth when applied against Liber AL vel Legis. We will apply this to specific words that are not English in origin to see if we can derive meaning wherefrom. This will be done in combination with the numerical equivalents as the system put forth herein is delineated. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"It will be left up to the reader to decide whether or not this provides any intrinsic and valuable meaning. Still, this is offered in the hopes of inspiring debate and furthering the development and research into an English Qabalah with the same depth and insight as that that the Hebrews (who have the half) have passed onto us. What follows is a relatively unknown document dictated by Aleister Crowley to Norman Mudd. This was obtained by the editor after the first draft of this work was completed and is added here as an appendix to the symbolic work delineated above. Appendix to Symbols of the English Alphabet (Crowley entitled this: The Order & Value of the English Alphabet, deriving this from his commentary of Liber Trigrammaton) A—Open, unmodulated breath (ah) B—Bursting forth; Sonnets about phallus & vulva; kissing C—Vide S & K D—The paternal vibration E—Softened but otherwise unmodulated breath F—Compound of P&H G—(Hard) Opening as if to devour G—(Soft)? /see Magick in theory & practice.

I was to assign values to English letters of some such order as obtains in Hebrew. I deal fully with this matter elsewhere. THE OLD COMMENT Done. See Liber Trigrammaton, Comment. THE NEW COMMENT The attribution in Liber Trigrammation is good theoretically; but no Qabalah of merit has arisen therefrom. (Motta’s comment: Surely it is a little early for that; a good Qabalah may take a few hundred years to unfold.) I am inclined to look further into the question of Sanskrit Roots, and into the Enochian Records, in order to put this matter in more polished shape. Liber AL vel Legis prophesizes the Prophet will ‘obtain’ the 'order & value' of the English Alphabet, per AL:II.55, as shown above. Crowley published an ordering of the letters, attributed to the Trigrams of Liber Trigrammaton, a received or ‘obtained’ text in 1912 ev. Often, a more general application is made of AL:I.56... AL I.56: \"Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected house cometh that child. Aum! All words are sacred and all prophets true; save only that they understand a little; solve the first half of the equation, leave the second unattacked. But thou hast all in the clear light, and some, though not all, in the dark.\" However, the text should be interpreted in context, which Crowley does. Note in his ‘new comment,’ he states, “The ‘equation’ is the representation of Truth by Word.” The reference is to the nature of prophecy. It would therefore be incorrect to consider the valuation of the letters as the second half of an equation. We could consider the second part of a solution to a riddle. In this case, an equation is not a solution. We need to adopt the Hebrew system for letter numbering, as simply numerating the 26 letters of the English alphabet, 1-26, will not produce enough number combinations to make a practical system of applied Gematria. And no value is given by the text or ‘word’ of Liber Trigrammaton. Indeed, no order is given; Crowley merely attributes letters through his own ingenium. There is in this, no representation of “Truth by Word.” We may then, effectively argue that this prophecy was not fulfilled by Crowley. This leaves us to reinterpret the word “Thou” in the text. Otherwise, we’ve found a major flaw in Liber AL vel Legis, which may or may not have implications in its value as a Class A document or the legitimacy of Aiwass as a praeterhuman intelligence. With the consistency that the document has had in so many other areas, it is reasonable to proceed as with the interpretation of “Thou,” which may be interpreted as ‘Not-I’ or Nuit, indicating the collective unconscious or aethyric force of our culture. Reliance on Liber AL vel Legis and its key as derived by Frater Achad, becomes the only reasonable standard by which we may measure success. And as with any Qabalistic process, it takes initiated insight in order to validate anything one might derive. This is ultimately left up to the working Qabalist in relation to his or her capacities. AL III.47: \"This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it.\" "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Liber 805 relies on the position of the letters in relation to each other; in other words, in the order they appear in Liber AL. The fact that Crowley sought after a solution, rather than allowing it to find him was his downfall in this prophecy and as prophesied. No one, not even Aiwass can predict the future and prophecy is generally not about prediction, but a greater or keener insight into what is. The general assumption that the prophet is infallible can only lead to error, which would compound Crowley’s error. The Order and Value of the English Alphabet While the symbols that we have attributed to the letters of the English alphabet were derived from the collective consciousness of our larger more mundane culture, the order and value do not have such a luxuriant ease of derivation. Still there is justification for this by virtue of the fact that our holiest of holy books, Liber AL vel Legis was revealed to us by Aiwass in this language and through the fabric of this consciousness. Therefore, it seems simply credible to seek the order and value in the revelation itself. This is very much akin to the technology employed by the Hebrews in their utilization of the Torah. The Hebrews started at the beginning (Berashith). By comparison, we have the first verses to the Book of the Law. The sequential order of the English letters as they make their first appearance in the tome is now a parallel idea. We are left with the following sequence from the first chapter of Liber AL: H A D T E M N I F S O U V L G C P Y R W B K J Z X Q Note that this is the only chapter of the book wherein all twenty-six letters are utilized. The other two chapters omit only the letter ‘Z’. And further, there is no embedding of this ordered arrangement at any other point in the book. However, because of the missing letter in the other two chapters, this presented order can be deemed significant. What remains is for values to be assigned to them. Of the letters as they appear in the text of AL, it is interesting to note that the vowels appear in their traditional order! With a numeration of only 1-26, many important values cannot be obtained with just one word, no matter how long. Though no one ever said this is a must, it does not make comparisons with other systems (Greek and Hebrew, mainly) readily possible. Yet again, applying the Hebraic method, this problem is solved. And we are given the following numeration: H=1 A=2 D=3 T=4 E=5 M=6 N=7 I=8 F=9 S=10 O=20 U=30 V=40 L=50 G=60 C=70 P=80 Y=90 R=100 W=200 B=300 K=400 J=500 Z=600 X=700 Q=800 Yet there are no ‘Mother Letters’ or ‘Final’ forms to further articulate the numeration. We are left with the above structure. Still, the Hebrew goes up to 900 utilizing these principles as it is an alphabet of only 22 letters compared to the English 26. We have here a strong parallel system of numeration. With numeration patterned in this manner, 1 to 10, 20 to 90, 100, 200, etc., the 26 letter English Alphabet goes up to 800. Now, the Greek Alphabet goes up to 800 as well, yet the final 3 letters, Chi, Psi, and Omega, are not very common. Relative to the Hebrew system, there are some huge tabulations as such, but in general the 2 systems are very compatible in their Gematria ranges. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"One of the previously attempted \"English Qabalah\"'s was based on Liber AL, III:47: \"This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it.\" Not only did this system seem to fail as it was based on deriving a string of letters from a zigzagged line game with A.C.'s handwritten manuscript, which has no blatant relation to the source of this mystery expressed in AL II:55, but also, the Magick that it's practitioners are deriving from it is leading them further and further from the Thelemic Current. More to the point, this other system, is consistently supporting the so-called Maatian Current, which in itself contradicts the Book of Law with claims of transcending the Aeon of Horus and even superceding it. Further, the qabalistic system has no internal consistency, but only a series of randomly chaotic coincidences that could also be derived from any numeration. AL III:47, however, has been used to verify the key of the Book of The Law by Frater Achad's discovery of the use of the number 31 and its triune relation to the number 93; so important in the Gamatric analysis of Liber AL. We will demonstrate that this further validates our own system contained herein. But the use of a textual foundation for the English Qabalah seemed the perfect theoretical start. Now all that was needed was a theory thus based that worked in practice. While any random schema can produce various ‘aha!’ number correspondences (key to successful Gematric practice), it is quite worthless as a system unless it be based on the key principle revealed by Frater Achad derived from AL III.47. To that end note the value of the word NOT as it equals 31. Other correspondences also serve to validate this new technology: AL II.15: \"For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed. The Empress and the King are not of me; for there is a further secret.\" ‘I’ in this system equals 8. Also, ‘I’ is shaped identically to the number 1; the “one in eight.” ‘I’ is of course, ‘me,’ the Hadit center in ourselves. TO MH = 31 (The Greek for ‘The Not’; symbolic for Nuit and equal to 418 in the Greek Qabalah;418 is also one of the numbers that Nuit gives to nothing in AL I.47) BAPHOMET = 418 (ABRAHADABRA) ABRAHADABRA = 814 (A ThRAShRQ of 418) \"Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen.\" AL I.46 Kenneth Grant aptly states that 61 is number of the negative conceiving itself as a positive; the essential point being in the word NOT and it’s fitting equivalence in both Achad’s key and our system. This we will elaborate on further. Symbolically, the letters N, O and T are worked out as follows: "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"N = Sum, Whole, Completion O = Ecstasy, Orgasm, Hail, Gasp T = Cross of Light, World of Elements, Intersection, Square Note that non-being is the mystery of the Ipsissimus which is an end to the Great Work; its final (N) mystery and ultimate ecstasy (O) of the ultimate light (T). Numerically and symbolically, we have verification and validation. As an aside, from AL II.55, please note the word “unto” equals 61 in the English Qabalah which is equivalent to Nun, Yod, Aleph meaning ‘nothing’ in Hebrew. Moreover, the three capital letters in this verse equate to 11. For that matter, ‘two and fifty-five’ (the numbers of the verse stated grammatically) is equal to 418 which of course, is the number of the Great Work; especially Crowley’s magnum opus which is the transmission of Liber AL from Aiwass to the world. Moreover, “they have the half” AL I.47 (referring to the Hebrews) equals 220 and is the number of lines contained in Liber AL; thus combining the two systems into an homogenous whole. “half” equals 62; which is a ThRAShRQ of 26—the number of letters in the English alphabet!...as much as it is twice 13. The fact that this English Qabalah is clearly connected to the Hebrew Qabalah is further supported by the following from HPB’s essay: The “Zohar” on Creation and the Elohim, which involves Genesis (the book upon which the Qabalah is built) and references The Source of Measures, by Ralston Skinner. By the means of number 31, or the word “El” (1 for Aleph” and 30 for “Lamedh”), and other numerical Bible symbols, compared with the measures used in the great pyramid of Egypt, he shows the perfect identity between its measurements - inches, cubits, and plan - and the numerical values of the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, and the Patriarchs. In short, the author shows that the pyramid contains in itself architecturally the whole of Genesis, and discloses the astronomical, and even the physiological, secrets in its symbols and glyphs... The Tree-of-Life and the English Qabalah The word “order” in AL II.55 equals 228 which is also equal to the Hebrew Word ‘Otz Chaiim’ translated as the Tree-of-Life. The first letter to appear in Liber AL is ‘H’ and is thus here attributed to Kether, ‘The Crown’. ‘H’ is transliterated as Heh in the Hebrew alphabet and as such, symbolizes ‘Spirit’ as in the formula of Elohim. The word ‘Spirit’ in the English Qabalah is equal to 210; which is the magickal formula of diminishing two to one to zero as per AL I.24-25: AL I.24: \"I am Nuit, and my word is six and fifty.\" Crowley’s comment shows a solution to the riddle: 24. Nuit: in Her Name are hidden secrets of Truth. Nu = 6 + 50 = 56 And we can complement this with the fact that in the EQ, N+U = 7+30 or 37. By multiplying, we get 210. The import of this is found in the next verse in AL. Crowley also comments that: "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6, Vau, is the Bull; and 50, Nun, the Scorpion. But 6 is also the number of the Sun, our Star. The N of Nu is therefore the Dragon -- \"Infinite Space\" -- and V is \"the Infinite Stars\" thereof. The ITH is the honorific termination representing Her fulfillment of Creative Force. \"I\" being the Inmost Force, and \"Th\" its Extension. The Dragon in current symbolism refers to the North or Hollow of Heaven; thus to the Womb of Space, which is the container and breeder of all that exists. Liber Aleph should be consulted for further information as to the magical import of Scorpio and Taurus. If we use the V instead of a U (they being the same in Hebrew) in the EQ, we get 7+40, which reduces to 11, as 5+6=11. AL I.25: \"Divide, add, multiply, and understand.\" Crowley notes in his commentary that “Dividing 6/50 = 0.12.” And from this we extract the digits in the sequence they occur; 012, to form a new number that we can setup in ThRShRQ as 210. 210 is also the value of spirit, which Crowley denotes by “Multiplying 50 x 6 = Shin, and Ruach Elohim, the Holy Spirit” and we find in the EQ as also being the value of the word Spirit. Crowley writes in his commentary to this verse: “I am inclined to believe that there is a further mystery concealed in this verse, possibly those of 418 and 666 again.” And we say, 210 is the new number that he was on the verge of finding. “One is the Spirit of the Living Gods” – Achatha Ruach Alohim Chayyim, or ARACh. This anagram is equal to 210 in Hebrew, which is also the value of the Hebrew word, Nephilim. It is the Nephilim that are the progeny of the mating of the Sons of God with the Daughters of Men in the Pseudpegripha; this being the symbolic revelation of God translated into Man as explained in our work on the Holy Table of Enochiana. Nephilim in the EQ is a word equaling 165 and reducing to 3, as does 210. 165 is also the value of the word ‘enlightenment,’ which itself is an emanation of energy. Thus, the Crown is Spirit. This is further elaborated upon especially in its relation to Nuit or NOX by Crowley’s commentary to LXV V.65: “What letter, then significant of Nuit, will transmute [Aleph, Daleth, Nun, Yod] as shin does [Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh]? The usual letter is he, “The Star,” Atu XVII, Aquarius. We thus obtain a Pentagrammaton [Aleph, Daleth, Heh, Nun, Yod]...” 210 is also equated to the word NOX from which the ‘Crown’ emanates. ‘Crown’ equals 397; a value for the Hebrew words translated into Latin as Lux Interna; which is a title of Kether. Additionally, 2 and 1 or ‘A’ and ‘H’ forms a word (AH) which is the reverse spelling of the word Heh in Hebrew and numerates to 6 by the Hebrew (3 in English which is half of 6!) which added to the letter Heh’s value of 5, equals 11 and is the number of the ‘Great Work.’ Thus we have ‘H’—the first letter of AL. ‘Crown’ can also be examined symbolically as follows: C = Sight R = Existence O = Greeting W = Others (Plural of ‘You’ or ‘U’ and a reference to the twins Harpocrates and Horus N = Sum, Whole, or Completion Thus ‘Crown’ can be seen as complete existence and awareness. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"And ‘Spirit’ may also be examined in like manner: S = Serpent, Curve P = Excretion; wasted or used up energy I = Ego (implying also the lack thereof) R = Existence I = ibid T = Intersection Thus, it is the fusion that is life generated from the intersection of points and the energy given off by that fusion. ‘Crown’ and ‘Spirit’ are thus symbolically connected. The second letter, ‘A’, is attributed to Chokmah, Wisdom. ‘A’ being phallic, represents by its shape, a ploughshare. It is thus cognate to the Supernal phallic ‘Father’ (Chokmah), the creative energy of the Logos. (Recall that the Magus—card number I of the Major Arcana—of the Tarot is Beth; which equals two in Hebrew as does A in the English.) A is also Zero by the Tarot. Hence we have yet another instance of 0=2. The third letter, ‘D’, is attributed to Binah. The Hebrew letter Daleth is referred to the Empress of the Tarot. The Empress is the Fertile Mother. In the Aeon of Horus, woman’s sexual function in the rite of fertility is finally championed as being just as shameless and healthy as that of the male. The old aeonic ‘Virgin’, which Gimel (equaling three by virtue of the Atus) is associated, is no longer deserving of deific status in the vulgar sense in which the term has been corrupted by the ‘Christists’ and their conventional morality. The ‘deific’ meaning of the ‘Virgin’ is however, still retained in the path of Gimel on the tree-of-Life and is expounded upon in Crowley’s Book of Thoth. Thus, Binah (Understanding) is equated with fertility. Hence ‘Babalon’; the whore open to all impressions, cf. AL III.55: “Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you!” However, ‘Virgin’ now means to be strictly dedicated wholly to the Great Work. Is not Babalon the guardian of the abyss? And Babalon has its symbolic correlation as follows: B = Be or existence A = First or primary B = ibid A = ibid L = Square or perpendicular O = Hail or Ecstasy N = Sum or Total These when taken together, suggest a whole existence or dedication to the work of existence and even hence, all manifested life. Moreover, the three Supernals (HAD) equal ten in Hebrew; the number of sephiroth on the Tree-of-Life. And they represent the entire tree as a reflection of the Supernals; which are themselves a reflection of the three-fold veil of the negative or Ain Soph Aur. But there is more concealed here. Father (A) plus the new Mother (D) and [her supplanting of] the old Mother (G) as Babalon whom still maintains her function as the path of the Priestess is equal to 65 or Adonai: The Holy Guardian Angel; hence the prosecution of the Great Work. It is"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"indeed the Priestess who virginizes the Adept in Tiphareth (still below the Abyss and hence, stained by duality) by stripping the Adeptus Exemptus of all attainments and hurling the adept across the Abyss to Binah! (Despite the drawing of the path on the tree, the Babe of the Abyss lands in the Sea of Binah or the City of the Pyramids.) This doctrine is further expanded upon in Marcelo Motta’s comment to AL II.52: “The concept of “Mary inviolate” is thus partial and unbalanced—and for this motive is qliphotic, unless it be checked by its opposite. The Greeks sensed this. Artemis was the Virgin Goddess, patroness of maidens. She had never submitted to the embrace of any god but Pan—and one of the great riddles of Eleusis was that Artmeis, having surrendereed herself to PAN—that is, to ALL—remained pure and virgin.” Interestingly enough, the Empress is the path that connects the Supernal Father and Mother on the Tree-of-Life. The initials of Chokmah and Binah (BJ) translates to the Hebrew word ‘bosom’: “...thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom...” AL I.61. Also, please note that Daleth equals 65 in our system. The fourth letter, ‘T’ is an initial of the second word ‘the’ in Liber AL and corresponds to Chesed; meaning Mercy. (“Mercy let be off: damn them who pity!” AL III.18 or even mercy contradistinct the qliphotic pity.) ‘T’ corresponds with the Hebrew letter Teth; which is attributed to the Lust Atu. It is Lust that refers to the spiritual empowerment of the Orgone or Kundalini energy which now manifests itself below the Abyss and directly below the creative Supernal Chokmah; which is ‘A’ in our system. That again is the spiritual phallus or Logos. This conception of the fourth Sephirah supplants the Hebraic one; which is a moral concept. Here we have Love in its natural bio-energetic sense. Note that Love is another title occasionally attributed to Chesed. The Love of the Lust Atu is of course, “love under will”; especially if you consider it under the phallic energy of Chokmah as noted in the preceding paragraph. Additionally, the value of the Hebrew Teth (9) and English ‘T’ (4) is equal to 13. This in turn is the value of the Hebrew word [Aleph Heh Beth Heh], translated as Love. And the AIQ BKR of the number 13 gives us 4; which is the value of the English ‘T’. The fourth sephirah is also considered to be the highest human attainment with the attainment of the supernals making one more than human. Keep that in mind as we apply the symbolic analysis to the word Energy; which is the perspective by which we are now viewing this Sephirah in and of itself and in relation to the Sephirah immediately above it on the tree. E = Energy N = Sum or Total E = ibid R = Existence G = Expression Y = Duality It can be said that Manifestation is Energy in a dualistic universe. Chesed is the first three-dimensional expansion in the natural devolution of the Supernals from the Ain. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The fifth letter to appear in the Book of the Law is not really the fifth new letter to appear. It is merely a stuttering of the original Spirit ‘H’. Here we have either the apparent corruption of Spirit by its repetition, and hence duality. Or for those who have destroyed duality, it is simply its own opposite contained in itself. Hence, the apparent manifestation of duality is the ‘ape’ of the original Spirit. In this instance, it represents Da’ath or the Abyss as it is qliphotic in nature. Also, note that ‘H’ cannot be drawn upside down and is the first of six such letters that exist in the English alphabet. Thus the actual fifth new letter of Liber AL is ‘E’. This Sephirah is called Geburah; which literally means Mighty. It is also called Severity and Justice or Din in Hebrew. ‘E’ is a transliteration of the Hebrew letter Heh whose value is 5 as in our system. A synonym for the three words already used to describe this Sephirah would be the word Energy. Time, Motion, Work, et al are measured via Energy which is the postulation of any fifth point to an already existing cube of four as described in the Naples Arrangement in the Book of Thoth. Interestingly enough, it is the path of Lust that connects ‘T’ (Lust) with ‘E’ (Energy) in our placement of English letters upon the Sephiroth of the tree. As well, our symbolic analysis of the word Energy is again gainfully applied. Further, the left Supernal attribution as you will recall, was the connecting path for the Supernal Father and Mother. Now, it is the right Sephirah’s attribution that connects the pair; two halves of a whole! Correspondences for the Goddess: NUIT=49 in EQ Babalon=156 in Hebrew=681 in EQ, which is the value of “Day of your wrath’—note it’s the cup of wrath that is the Cup of Our Lady. Man of Earth = 156 in EQ; a grade involves the work of accepting all Impressions; which is the formula of the Scarlet Woman. 156 = “Pan is Nuit” in EQ; a recursion of the formula of NOT. The essential point is in the word NOT and its fitting equivalence in both Achad’s key and our system. This we will elaborate on further. 106 is also the Hebrew letter Nun (meaning Fish and also the Death Atu) spelled in full (Nun Vav Nun). Adding the value of ‘N’ (50 in the Hebrew Qabalah) to 106, we get 156; which is the value of Babalon in the Hebrew Qabalah. 106 is also the value of the word Hell by the English Qabalah. Hell is Hadit as per Motta’s commentary on AL:II.63; “Hell’s own worm” being Hadit, the complement of Nuit. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"  H   D   A E   T  M  I   N   F   S"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The sixth new letter in Liber AL is ‘M’. This is attributed to Tiphareth as the sixth sphere. In the Aeon of Osiris, ‘M’ or Mem represented the Dying God Formula and Tiphareth was referred to as the ‘Christ Consciousness’ by the adepts. Now is ‘M’ Mars and Mercury; Ra-Hoor-Khuit—the Crowned and Conquering Child or the Son/Prince. It is also the Man-God for “There is no god but man” taught in Liber OZ. The path from ‘M’ (Man-God, Tiphareth) to ‘F’ (Foundation, Yesod) is Samekh (equal to 60), the Art Atu. Now, 60 + 6 (M) + 9 (F) is equal to 75 (Nun Vav Yod Teth or Nuit as the Star Goddess). Moreover, 75 + 31 (Not in the English Qabalah and Aleph Lamed or AL) = 106; which is the value of the word Art in the English Qabalah. 106 is also the Hebrew letter Nun (meaning Fish and also the Death Atu) spelled in full (Nun Vav Nun). Adding the value of ‘N’ (50 in the English Qabalah) to 106, we get 156; which is the value of Babalon in the Hebrew Qabalah. 106 is also the value of the word Hell by the English Qabalah. Hell is Hadit as per Motta’s commentary on AL II.63 “Hell’s own worm”. Hadit is 18 by the English Qabalah and added to 75 (again, the path and its connecting Sephiroth as described above) is equal to 93—a multiple of 31! And more importantly, it is one of the most sacred Thelemic numbers relating to the extant mission of Liber AL itself. Further, 9 by the English Qabalah is the letter ‘F’ which symbolically means Failure and of course, belongs to Yesod. This is the treading of the same connecting path in its opposite and devolutionary manner; cf. Liber LXV II.5, 6: “I suffered the deadly embrace of the Snake and the Goat; I paid the infernal homage to the shame of Khem. Therein was this virtue, that the One became the all.” The dual world is “the all” and Yesod is the base or Foundation in the dual manifestation. Yesod is also the gate that opens the Yetziratic universe. And Art is the next direct path leading straight up the tree. The word Art can also be analyzed symbolically: A = First R = Existence T = Light The first hint of the existence of light for the aspirant is in the Rainbow path of Art. The seventh new letter in AL is ‘N’, attributed to the seventh Sephirah Netzach. Netzach translates as Victory (as in Nike), and in the Hindu system corresponds with Ananda (Bliss). Nun (transliterated as ‘N’) is the Death card in the Tarot. The Bliss of Death: The Crown of All; “the consciousness of the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body.” AL I.26 ...and actually, this is how Ouarda’s “whiter words” renders it. Further, Netzach is Venus or the Scarlet Woman. ‘N’ is the initial of the word Nuit and Netzach is the lower manifestation of this. Nuit is 49 or 7 squared by the English Qabalah. And Nuith equals 50 by the English Qabalah; which is the value of Nun. Further, Nuit can by symbolically examined as follows: N = Sum U = You I = Myself T = Light "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Nuit can be said to be the sum of you and I which is pure light (LVX) or the Breath and Logos when spiritualized by adding ‘H’ (value of 1) to get 50, which is the number of the Gates of Understanding. This by AIQ BKR reduces to 5; a number of Hadit. It also seems fitting here to examine the word 'Light' as it is connected with Nuit: L= perspective I= self G= aspire H= breath T= Intersection Tiphareth (T) is the intersection of all the Sephiroth but Malkuth and it is the Light (LVX) we Aspire to, the Logos or Breath of God, the Higher Self and the true perspective of being. This word equals 123 in the English Qabalah, which when adding the digits together, gives us the mystical number of Binah. And of course, reducing to 6 we get the number of Tiphareth. Interestingly enough, as a multiple of 3, we get the equation 41x3. 41 is the number of the Barren Mother and the Hebrew word for Mother. This suggests the Ordeal of the Abyss unto the Great Mother, which the Exempt Adept prepares for. And it is discussed in Chapter 41 of the Book of Lies. Tiphareth is the apex of the Ethical Triad with Chesed, the Sphere of the Exempt Adept being one of its other corners. The ThRShRQ of 41 (14) also works in accord with this as the Adeptus Exemptus trains the mind to equivocate opposites. But also there are the changing perceptions of the Universe that should be carefully studied in Chapter 14 of the Book of Lies. The eighth new letter is ‘I’, also a transliteration from the Hebrew letter Yod. It is attributed to the Sephirah Hod; which means Splendour. Yod is attributed to the Hermit Atu and is further described in Liber AL II.24: “Behold! These be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who be hermits. Now think not to find them in the forest or on the mountain; but in beds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eyes, and masses of flaming hair about them; there shall ye find them.” The Hermit of the New Aeon is indeed one of Splendour! The Hindu attribution is Chit which means Thought. ‘I’ is indeed here the ego as per our symbolic attribution. Ego is equal to 85 by the English Qabalah which numerals adumbrate the eighth and fifth Sephiroth; connected by the path of the Hanged Man Atu and suggests the true nature of Sacrifice in the new Aeon. This is clearly elucidated in Crowley’s Book of Thoth. Peh spelled in full [Peh Heh] equals 85 by the Hebrew Qabalah and translates to the word Mouth. You will recall that the previous horizontally connecting paths bore a relation to a Sephirah to the left and then to the right. And Da’ath (‘H’) mimicked the Crown-Spirit (‘H’). Here the connecting path between Hod and Netzach is represented by the Tower Atu (the Hebrew letter Peh); which is itself reflected in the Sephirah below these two. The Foundation again, has attributed to it the letter ‘F’ which is also a transliteration of the Hebrew letter Feh which is the Hebrew letter Peh without a dagesh or diacritical mark in the midst of the letter. Another connection can be made to Yesod by adding the Hebrew Feh (80) with the number of Yesod (‘F’ or 9) to produce the number 89. This is the number that is equivalent to the English word Pan; who is the All-devourer and All-begetter and also Nuit! Also, 89 is the numeration of the Hebrew word [Gimel Feh] Guf which translates as Body. Pan may be symbolically analyzed as follows: "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"P = Excretion A = First N = Sum From this we can say that the manifested universe is a spiritual expulsion of the ‘fall’ denoted in Genesis. Hence an allusion to the Body that is the Nephesch; usually referred to Yesod. 89 is also the number of the \"Shut Ups\"1 or Black Brothers whom are products of failure in the Abyss. And PAN is a Guardian of the Abyss. The tenth new letter to appear in Liber AL, and attributed to the tenth Sephirah Malkuth is ‘S’. Sameck is the Hebrew letter transliterated into English as ‘S’ and means Prop. Malkuth translates as the World or the Universe and hence an allusion to the path connecting Malkuth with Yesod or ‘F’ (9) and ‘S’ (10) which by AIQ BKR is first added together to create 19 with those digits equalling 10 (and finally reduced to the number 1). Taking into account the Hermetic Axiom “As above, so below”, the Sephiroth for Wisdom (2) and Understanding (3) can be added together to get 5; which doubled (by virtue of the two Sephiroth), equals 10. Or we can add the Hebrew letter Heh (transliterated as ‘H’; Spirit as noted above) with a value of 5 to get 10. Or further still, we can add the value of the English words Wisdom (247) and Understanding (246) to get the value of 493 which is the value of the word Malkuth. ‘S’ again, corresponds with the Hebrew letter Sameck and has the value of 60 in the Hebrew Qabalah. Sameck means Prop which represents the material universe as a tool of Spirit. If we take Kether (‘H’ and transliterate it to the Hebrew letter; doing the same for ‘H’ (Heh or 5) we get 65 or a number of the Holy Guardian Angel corresponding to Tiphareth in the middle of the tree. Malkuth is said to be the seat of the Holy Guardian Angel. ‘S’ and ‘H’ may also be transliterated to Shin which means Spirit. Hence, Malkuth is in Kether and Kether is in Malkuth, but after a different manner. This English Qabalah has already yielded forth not just a coherent and Thelemic set of interpretations to the Tree-of-Life. It also gives us a new aeonic point from which to base further research into this system. Interestingly enough, we have attributed the first ten English letters to the Major Paths as the Hebrew letters have been attributed to the Minor Paths. “But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.” AL I.47 Still, there are sixteen remaining letters which conveniently happen to correspond to the sixteen sub-elements in the Western Mystery Tradition. Magick, as defined by Aleister Crowley, is the “Science and Art of causing Change in conformity with the Will.”. The Art is the Action or the ‘going’ as in the motion of all graphic presentations of the Egyptian hierarchy. The Science is the Intellectual analysis (solve) coupled by Intellectual synthesis (coagula). The Art Atu pictures this alchemical process. Art is also, by it’s Hebrew letter correspondence, Samekh; which translates as prop. We may then derive the idea that science and the intellect are props for action. This would also be consistent with twentieth century e.v. Existentialist Philosophy. Samekh also corresponds with Sagittarius of the zodiac. Sagittarius is the Archer, which can be said to represent fiery destruction of a principle by means of analysis (a divisive procedure); consistent with its opposition to the intellectual Gemini in astrological theory. Samekh also   1 Cf. Liber 333"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"corresponds with the English ‘S’, and has a value of 10 in the English Qabalah. And 10 is the number of Malkuth, the Virgin Daughter of Tetragrammaton. The above is an example of the theory of correspondence. A system that contains predictable patterns. The really great thing about the discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto to an Occultist at least, is that the 3 new planets finally filled all 10 Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. 10 Planets + 22 Paths=10 Numbers+22 Trumps=10 Sephiroth + 22 Hebrew Letters. The Astrological correspondences of the Qabalah are finally based on an exact, scientific correspondence in quantity. The obvious difference with the English Alphabet lies in it’s 26 letters as compared to 22 for Hebrew. Yet this difference of 4 is really a fool’s knot: 26 yields: 10 Sephirah + 16 Elements and Sub-elements 26 x 2 = 52; the full course of one Sun. A further complement of this is in the value of AL. In the Hebrew, this equals 31, giving us 93. In the English, this equals 52 (weeks of the year or complete solar cycle), giving us 156, Babalon. The full spelling of the Hebrew letter Resh (the Sun) is Resh, Shin, which is English transliteration is R, S and H; equaling 111. Also, the 22 Paths on the Tree of Life are contained in this equation: the Hebrew letters stay in their place as Paths. Thus we have 10 English letters, and 22 Hebrew Paths. If the Jews have the half in that the Hebrew letters are retained as above, a fascinating holism of qabalistic forms give birth to the last key to the puzzle of corresponding a 26 letter alphabet with all the symbolism the 22 letter Hebrew system encompasses. We may then further test this theory by applying it an elemental system. Other words that merit examination and further validate this system will now be presented: A - Perfect T - Light U – Not-I Atu, meaning Mystery (M and 6 in EQ) equals 36, which is 62. We can form a sentence that says ‘The perfect light is the universal light.’ T – Light, Time (Out) E - Energy M – Mystery P - Excretion L - Perspective E – Energy Temple equals 150, which is ten times 15, the Devil Atu (Ayin). This central mystery (Osiris is a Black God) requires an ‘objective consciousness’ for proper perspective and we might even be able to extrapolate the idea of sacrificial offering from the word excretion. But certainly this objective consciousness is a light beyond time and that light is pure energy. Ayin is the path that connects Tiphareth with Hod, from Hod to the inner sanctum, the Temple. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"E - Energy A - Perfect G - Aspire L - Perspective E – Energy Eagle equals 122, which reduces to 5, the Pentagram and number of Man. As a symbol, it represents perfection and power. That is why it was adopted as the symbol of the three major nations in human history (Egypt, Rome, America). And the meanings of the letters bear this out...especially as these three nations each consciously aspired to such greatness with America’s yet to be fully realized. And it is interesting to note that 122 is also 61x2. With 61 representing the Jews as per Liber AL, their origin as Israelites in Egypt continues through Christianized Rome and the alleged bloodline of David in European aristocracy; up until modern times with America's ties to Israel and the Zionist agenda (for better or for worse!). T – Light, Time (Out) R - Being U – Not-I T – Light, Time (Out) H – Ladder, Breath Truth equals 139 in our system, which reduces to 13; the work completed and the Death Atu (Nun or 50; the Gates of Understanding). A sentence can be made that says: The light of being, beyond time is in the breath or Logos that is the ladder to the stars. We move on now to the three veils on the Tree-of-Life: Q – Question, Intelligence E - Energy S – Curve H – Ladder, Breath E - Energy T - Light H – Breath, Ladder Qesheth equals 826, which reduces to 16 (The Tower Atu, which is posited halfway between Qesheth and Paroketh) and then to 7, which the Gematric value of Abyss also reduces to. And of course, Qesheth as the conclusion of the Zelator ordeal in Yesod alludes to the mystical connection between Yesod and Da’ath (the Abyss). Qesheth then ultimately brings the Aspirant to Hod and so the arrow bends to the left on the Tree, rather than straight to Tiphareth (as that requires the successful traversal of Paroketh) much as from Tiphareth, the arrow bends to the left on the Tree, bringing the Aspirant to Binah rather than Kether. Q as intelligence is appropriate for Hod, and the energetic curve that provides a ladder into the heart of the Astral Triad on the Tree-of-Life is formed from the symbolic meanings of the letters of the word in this American English Qabalah. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"P - Excrete A - Perfect R - Being O – Orgasm, Hail K – Knock, Strike E - Energy T - Light H – Breath, Ladder These three veils conform to the Gnostic Circle with its triad of angles numbered 3, 6 and 9. Paroketh equals 612, which reduces to 9 or 32. As the veil that leads to Tiphareth, the 6th Sephirah, we have a perfect allusion to the Gnostic Circle with Tiphareth being the central Sephirah between Yesod (9/Qesheth) and Binah (3/Abyss). Even the number 612 as 600 (reducing to 6) and 12 (1-2=3) creates more recursion of this idea. The symbolic meaning of the letters suggests the mystical concept of Initiation: “He who would save his life will lose it.” The O and K in the middle (OK) equals 420, which reduces to 6 with OK suggesting ‘All Right’ (alright) or Asar un Nefer (Myself made Perfect). A - Perfect B - Exist Y – Choice, Question S – Curve, Serpent S – Double-U (sideways) Abyss equals 412, which reduces to 7, suggesting Saturn (the 7th planet). The suggestion of choice in the symbolism of the central letter (why) reveals the choice of the Adept between the Great White Brotherhood and the Black Lodge. May Because be accursed for ever! If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops & does nought. If Power asks why, then is Power weakness. Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & all their words are skew-wise. Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog! AL II.29-33 And of course, also note the ideas on Qesheth as delineated above, connecting the Abyss (Da’ath) with Yesod (Qesheth). The following is an examination of the Four Powers of the Sphinx: S - Curve, Serpent I - Ego, Eye L - Perspective E - Energy N - Sum, Variable C - Average, Vision E - Energy We start in reverse of the traditional order with Silence, which equals 155 and reduced to 11. Interestingly enough 'SH' (sound made to ask someone to be silent...including the Sign of Silence!) equals 11. The sentence we can form from the letter symbols is: In silence we observe the working of self and the whole energy of our being."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"D - Poor, Dunce A - Best R - Being E - Energy Dare equals 110, which is ten times 11. The sentence we can derive from the symbolic meaning of the letters is: Energetic being in action, for better or for worse. But acting! One must act as per the Bhagavad-Gita. W - 2 You's I - Ego, Eye L - Angle L - Perspective Will equals 308, which reduces to 11. This word is certainly suggestive of Tiphareth, which has two perspectives; Adeptus Minor Within & Without. And like Da'ath (see below) it unites dualities or a duality in this case, the higher and lower egos. The other interpretation of the letter 'I' gives us Eye or 'Eye of Horus,' also appropriate here. K - Strike Out N - Variable O - Orgasm, Hail W - 2 You's The Gematria on this is more complicated if we want to get to 11. And it may be argued that this is a bit forced. But with the other three powers equalling 11, this may not be as far-fetched as one might want to argue. But Know equals 627, which reduces to 15, Ayin and the Devil Atu (the Serpent or Devil bids Adam & Eve to eat from the Tree-of-Knowledge in Genesis). 15 reduces to 6 again, for Know and Da'ath (Knowledge) equals 14, which reduces to 5. 5+6=11. The letter symbolism can be read to note that Strike Out and Orgasm are both consciousness annihilators (le petit morte) with of course the Abyss experience producing two variables: Master of the Temple or Black Brother. We have but now to examine Da'ath. D - Poor, Dunce A - First, Best A - Perfect T - Light, Time Out H - Ladder, Breath By letter symbol, we have the best (A) and the worst (D) being united outside time (T) with Da'ath being a ladder upwards to the Supernals. Finally, there's Maya, the Hindu Tantric Goddess of illusion and Magick. Maya equals 100, which is the sacred number of Crowley’s O.T.O. and the numeration of his Liber C. M - Mystery A - First Y - Choice A - Excellent "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The sacred mystery about Maya is that the consciousness of the Universe (Macrocosm) becomes individualized (Microcosm) and this union is formulated in Thelemic Magick by way of sexual techniques developed in part from Hindu Tantra. This is the secret of the IXth Degree in Crowley's O.T.O., which works on the plane of Malkuth, utilizing a complete Tree-of-Liber or 102. This duality is shown by the letter Y with the two A's being the two stars uniting. The Elemental System of the English Qabalah As has been demonstrated, the Hebrew letters are posited on the Minor Paths, and each Hebrew letter can of course still be transliterated into English. If we directly compare the two alphabets, we find four English letters that stick out from the two sets of twenty-two letters. This of course suggests a tetragrammaton. And we can apply the remaining four letters to the four Greek elements. These four Elemental letters, on a certain plane, can also be said to correspond to the minor paths 11-14 as immediately following the ten major paths of the Sephiroth; as delineated in Crowley’s table of correspondences. The paths that the four elemental letters correspond with in Hebrew, are Aleph (1) +Beth (2) +Gimel (3) + Daleth (4) = 10, the Mystic Number of any Tetragrammaton. The English letters are OCBQ. The Elemental Tablets The Court Cards of the Tarot are permutations of the sixteen elements and sub-elements; providing us with a precedent for applying these four pendant English letters in an elemental fashion. The letters simply go in order, like the alphabet itself; beginning with the first letter of the four, ‘O’. Four columns of these four letters may be fashioned for Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, respectively; adding the remaining twelve by attributing them to the remaining sub-elements. Note that the focal matrix of this system is that of a 4 by 4 system. It will be evidenced later how the very Geometry of the 4 by 4 system yields ten Tetragrammatons. This results in a Tablet of 40. And the Geometry of a 4 by 10 system is itself a confirmation of splitting English into a Sephirotic and Elemental system of 10 and 16 respectively. Table of 16 O U V L G C P Y R W B K J Z X Q A O I U E V L G L C H P Y G R C W K B K J J F Z X Q "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The nature and character of the Hebrew tetragrammaton obey the same mathematical constructs of the 4 (triplicites) by 3 (quadruplicities) zodiacal organization of sub-elements; equaling 12. And we of course, add this to the 4 primary elements to derive 16. OCBQ and the twelve remaining letters fit into this mathematical schemata perfectly. Again, a brief note to evaluate method seems pertinent. Aleph is an Ox, and by it’s shape is a ploughshare; hence, the Phallus or primary manifestation of fire. ‘A’, the corresponding letter in English by transliteration, represents Chokmah, being 2, and is thus the Father; hence, Phallic. Yet Aleph is 1 and A is 2. Aleph has a phallic shape, while A has a Pentagrammic shape. They each contain the same core meaning, but they express this differently. Further, Aleph is zero (0) in the Major Arcana with this suggesting the letter ‘O’. Another example of cross-cultural application can be found in the I-Ching and the Tarot. The 64 Hexagrams correspond succinctly with the 32 qabalistic paths. Yet the figures from the 2 systems have different personalities, no matter how much of the same ideas they might convey. It is up to us Qabalists to constantly analyze and synthesize the data and the personalities behind the data. The first group of four in this last sixteen is OUVL; fire broken into its sub-elemental expressions (Fire of Fire, Water of Fire, Air of Fire, Earth of Fire) corresponding to the elemental Salamanders. ‘O’ is the root elemental letter. The next grouping of letters is GCPY for the Undines with the ‘C’ being the root elemental letter. And then we have RWBQ for the Sylphs with ‘B’ being the root elemental letter. Finally, we have JZXQ for the Gnomes with ‘Q’ being the root elemental letter. From this, we can fashion Gematrias and for that matter, symbolic, Temuric, and Notational correspondences. Some Gematric ideas follow. 1. OUVL=140=‘A’ (Chokmah or 2) multiplied by ‘C’ (Water or 70). The essential fire is united with the watery part of its nature which of course, works in an almost alchemical fashion. Here, the heat of the alembic is the mathematical process. 2. GCPY=300=‘B’ (Air of Air) = ‘D’ (Binah) multiplied by ‘R’ (Fire of Air; but also the English words SUN + MOON)= ‘D’ (Binah) multiplied by ‘S’ (Malkuth) squared. The feminine nature of water is clearly shown. And then a foreshadow of it’s union with fire to birth air is suggested. 3. RWBK=1000= ‘D’ (Binah) multiplied by ‘B’ (Air of Air) + ‘R’ (see above) = ‘S’ (Malkuth) cubed. The third step to air in this alchemical process and again a foreshadowing of earth are both suggested by the ‘S’ cubed. 4. JZXQ= 2600= ‘S’ (Malkuth) multiplied by 26 (the total number of letters in the English alphabet). And the final point in this process is reached to make a complete manifestation. (Of course, everything then begins anew. The Elements ‘O’= The 11th new letter to appear in Liber AL, signifies Magick, the first utilization of the 10 under will now being possible with the idea of 11. It’s value is 20. As such, it hides the Key 31 (NOT) not only within it, but, of course, by it’s pictorial resemblance to 0. As 20, it represents 0=2, but from the viewpoint of the Magician (2). In English usage, it represents fiery emotion, and is synonymous with the ecstasy of Orgasm by the symbolic method. Or, it is used to interrupt one train of thought with the sudden onrush of the next, e.g., “Oh! I forgot to tell you...” ; “Oh ... uh, this is what I meant ...”, or the climactic response to new data, “Oh ... I see ...”."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" ‘C’ - The 16th new letter to appear in Liber AL, C has a value of 70. By it’s shape, it suggests the Womb. By it’s sound, it suggests Binah, The Great Mother, The Great Sea. This fits in perfectly with it’s mathematical placement on the table as Water of Water or Hey Superior of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton. ‘O’, being the 11th letter, and C being the 16th, we get 27, the number of verses it takes for Liber AL to give the English Alphabet. ‘B’ - The 21st new letter in Liber AL, ‘B’ has a value of 300. By it’s shape, it is a circle that is split and placed with one half on top, the other below, glued together by a vertical line. Hence the quality of division, Air of Air. By it’s sound, it implies existence hence, awareness as again, per the symbolic method. It is fitting that it is also here then the Son, Air. The 27 mentioned above, plus 21 here, yields 48 - the doubling of the number of possible permutations of any Tetragrammaton. ‘B’ then would be equivalent to Vav in the traditional Hebrew tetragrammatic permutation. Eheih equals 21 in Hebrew which is a pronunciation of those four letters. So it becomes apparent that the attribution of this letter to Air is fitting. ‘Q’ - The 26th and last new letter in Liber AL and of the English system has a value of 800. By it’s shape, it suggests coitus. Just as “O!” is the cry of ecstasy, we now have at the end, Q; which suggests continuation and manifestation as it is a coital pictogram. Here, ‘O’ is also now the Womb, but it needs the line (1) to ground it into a regenerative cycle. ‘Q’ then is “Earth of Earth”; especially due to its suggestion of fertility. Indeed, Father and Mother (O and C) are merely made up of the circle (the unbroken circle for the Father, and the broken circle for the Mother), while the Son (B) and Daughter/Bride (Q), are admixtures of their parents. Taking this familial paradigm into account, the meaning of the sound, “queue” (line or sequence of persons, vehicles, etc., waiting their turn), completes our analysis of the English Tetragrammaton; attributed to Kether, OCBQ. Technical Analysis of the Order and Value Note first that the vowels appear in the first chapter in the exact same order as they are traditionally taught to children in grade school: a, e, i, o, u, (y). H=1; Suggests a ladder, reminiscent of Jacob’s Ladder. Heh is the Star Atu—Had is the Star inside of us. The ladder climbs to heaven or the Stars. A=2; First, perfect, excellent; Aleph is the Ox & None ‘by the book.’ The Ox and None are two items one being +1 and the other being the negation or –1, giving us the 2=0 formula. The Beast (Ox) has the Starry essence (None). As the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet is numbered 1, so the second letter of this arrangement is as the first in the traditional order of the alphabet. D=3; A grade just short of failure, Dunce. Daleth in Hebrew means door and certainly a door implies a failure or weakness in the structure of a wall as it becomes the easiest point where a wall can be breached. And yet, through the door, we can enter or exit a house. Beth is house in Hebrew; B in EQ equals 300 and reduces to 3 (D); suggesting Boleskine. T=4; the Hebrew letter Tau is 400 and reduces to 4. The Universe Atu (Tau) is the four worlds of the QBL. Tau means cross, which is 4-armed. E=5; This letter transliterates to Aleph in the Hebrew. Aleph is the first, which follows the last (Tau or T) and which is before this letter in this order. E is energy in scientific formulae and"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"since it has the same value as Heh in Hebrew, we have the H that is the first letter of this order. EQ on this formula: E (5)=M (6/Beast) * C2 (4900/Babalon) or 29,400 or 15, Devil Atu. And interestingly enough, E=5 in the Greek Qablah as well. M=6; Looks like two mountains of which the Rosicrucians had two that were important to them. It’s also a sideways lightening flash and the reverse of the letter ‘W’. W is Vau or 6, which could be M/Mysteries Averse. The Hebrew letter Mem, spelled in full equals 90. And divided by 6, equals 15 (the Devil Atu) of which 1+5=6. N=7; Sum/Total...Nun is Death Atu, which is the sum total of all experience and Initiation. I=8; Ego/Myself—Veil of Qesheth to Hod or 8 represents change in egoic structure. F=9; Failure. 9 is glyph of circle and line. The line is two points connected and with the circle we have an allusion to 2=0. The line also represents the failure of the squaring of the circle, which is “a key also”. Yesod (9) to Da’ath is a secret key in and of itself. F is also prominent in VIAOV formula (V=40 in EQ). VIAOV =109 in EQ; 1 and 0 are the components of 9. V as Death is failure, which is victory. S=10; Serpent by shape; Gnostic symbol (Aud/Aub=Aur; Caduceus). Sameck leads to Tiphareth/LVX, which equals 790 in EQ and reduces to 16 (Tower Atu), which crosses with Sameck. This intersection is important for Dominus Liminis. O=20; Full Circle, Return & Reincarnation; the Seasons/Time. All things of circles were considered Satanic by the Puritans. O is the transliteration of the Hebrew letter Ayin of the Devil Atu. U=30; You and Not-I – Universe (Nuit) composed of 30 Aethyrs and 30 Gnostic Aeons. V=40; [LVX Sign] Sign of Apophis (Killer of Osiris); Vau is nail used in Crucifixion. Make a V with the index and medius fingers and you have the Victory/Peace sign. Death is victory snatched out of the jaws of defeat. See the EQ letter ‘F’. The Jews also make a V sign with the fingers of the hand, secretly by the father of the family, under the table during Torah readings at the Passover Seder. L=50; [LVX Sign] Sign of the Mourning of Isis; 90 angle (circle squared, see EQ ‘F’ & ‘V’); T-Square, reminiscent of the letter ‘T’ (above)—Tau means cross or cross of light. LVX equals 790 in EQ, which reduces to 16, the Tower Atu that is the connecting link in the formula of ON, which is the ‘65’ formula. L’s reverse is J, which equals 500. G=60; Sigh of exasperation; a surrender. Gimel crosses the Abyss; a surrender. 60 equals Sameck, the Art Atu, which pierces the Veil of Paroketh. 3x20/Gimel x O in EQ—full circle from Binah to reflection back down into the Ruach of MT. C=70; See (100 as 10squared, full vision of Tree, C=100 in Latin, C-Note is $100.00 bill; Mediocre or Average (Average/A/Ayin/Devfil Atu = 70, reminiscent of the idea that we are each the Beast). P=80; Pee or Urine and phonetically, ‘you’re in’...getting past the Veil of Paroketh and fully in the Ruach. This letter directly connects with the Hebrew as Peh also equals 80. And so we have the Tower Atu, featuring the Eye of Horus. EQ 8 is Qesheth, 80 is Paroketh, which leaves the Great Work for 418. The Jews are concerned with the 3-fold Veil of the Negative; Ain Soph Aur."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Thelemites, 8, 80 & 418 as per Liber AL; the three veils on the Tree-of-Life. And so the Jews have the half. Y=90; Fork in the road/Choice (as in choosing between Emperor and Star Atus/Tzaddi=90). Why?—a question. The letter physically resembles Ayin, which equals 70 and when transliterated as O becomes 20 in EQ; 70+20=90. “Why?” is the question that the Serpent asked in the Garden of Eden, tempting Eve to eat of the Tree-of-Knowledge (of the true nature of Self), “Every man and every woman is a star.” Star is self, Emperor/Tzaddi as each of us are kings of our own destiny. And of course, the king takes the road less traveled when he or she arrives at the fork in the road. R=100; Are, we Are—Being US—‘are’ and ‘our sound similar. Resh (the Sun) equals 200 or 100 x 2 (US). 100 is 102 Tree-of-Life fully envisioned. The Tree-of-Life is the Caduceus (Middle Pillar) surrounded by 2 entwining serpents...Aud and Aub (Pillars of Mercy and Severity) that altogether make Light ‘Aur’ (again a phonetic link to ‘our’ and ‘are’). W=200; Reverse of M=6EQ. 200 divided by 6 equals 33 1/3 or 1/3 of 100 (Tree)—See ‘M’ where it says 6 Vau is part of M-averse. W, U & V are transliterations of Vau. All of this is tri-fold with 2 U’s (M and W as Vau) being ‘double-u’). B=300; To exist—to Be. 300 reduces to 3/Binah/Not or non-existence. Number 3 EQ letter is D or Door/Daleth as mystery gateway of Pyramid to the Sky/Orion by way of Isis, Mother of Initiation (and Binah is ‘Sorrow of Great Mother’). Mother is Cancer, a glyph shown as 69 turned sideways. 369, number of the Gnostic Circle. K=400; Strike (Baseball & Bowling), KO (Knock Out/Boxing), Thousand (e.g. 100K Salary). Kaph is Atu 10/Fortune. All sports represent the vicissitudes of life “the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat”. 1000 is a multiple of 10. Kaph = 20, 20 in EQ is the circle O, Wheel of Fortune. J=500; incorrect or transgressing as in ‘J-walking’; joint/marijuana cigarette (illegal); joint (as in place). Along with J, I & Y are also transliterations of Yod/10. 10 is S in EQ, Serpent, transgressor in Garden of Eden. I+Y in EQ = 98 (2x49) + J = 598, which reduces to 22 (Atus). 500 reduces to 5, which is V in Latin; Vau also has 3 English letter transliterations. J’s reverse is L, which equals 50. Z=600; Lightening Flash, only first chapter in Liber AL has this letter. Zeus the Emperor throws the lightening bolts...TZaddi. Emperor is Atu 4. 600 divided by 4 is 150 or 15 (Devil Atu) and 1+5=6, which 600 reduces to. X=700; [LVX Sign] Sign of Osiris Slain and Risen. Ordeal X, which is chaotic justice as getting zapped by a bolt of lightening. X is T or Cross on an angle. T or Tau = 400 + 300 (to Be; Osiris slain; or not to be) = 700. Q=800; Quotient-Product of division. That the “pain of division is as nothing’; end of cycle, back to nothing into body of Nuit. 800 reduces to 80, one of the Veils (Paroketh) with 8 being one of the others (Qesheth) and Nuit suggests Veil of the Abyss. Is not her manifestation always at an end? "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"From Liber AL vel Legis: \"I am Nuit, and my word is six and fifty.\" AL I.24 To hear Nuit say that she has a “word” or a ‘logos’...a son, is profound indeed. In the scheme of the Tree-of-Life, the logos is the central mystery at Tiphareth. Note that the letter M is symbolically, mystery, and equals six, which is the number of Tiphareth. Fifty of course, is the number of the ‘Gates of Understanding’ and is the value of the letter ‘L’ in this system. This would be the peculiar angle or perspective of the individual in the symbolic system. And so Nuit can be said to be identifying herself as a manifested goddess with 56 also being a key number in the analysis of the formula of ON. \"Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen.\" AL I.46 With G being symbolically, an aspiration and H representing breath, together equaling 61, here is a further analysis of the Jewish ‘half’. From there, we have the three veils described in The Veil of Qesheth. Note the first veil is eight, I (ego of the Zelator2) and the second, P in the English or Peh in the Hebrew. KSI makes 418 in the EQ and can transliterate into Kaph, Sameck and Yod. Kaph is Jupiter, ruler of Sagittarius, which is Sameck and leads to Tiphareth...the greater ‘I’ which can be one and which Yod=10 reduces down to. 418 is also interesting. The one in the middle can be the I surrounded by T=4 and I=8 or ‘IT’3. \"My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us. The Five Pointed Star, with a Circle in the Middle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black to the blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.\" AL I.60 11 is S+H or Silence. Nuit’s number is again, none...Silence. \"For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed. The Empress and the King are not of me; for there is a further secret.\" AL II.15 Nine is 'F' in this system and 'F' is failure, the fool's paradise. The letter 'I' in upper case resembles the number one (1) and equals eight in this system. 'I' of course, symbolically, is the ego, Hadit. So 'I' can be shown here to be \"one in eight\" a further corroboration so fittingly fount with the word \"Not\" in this same verse and the correllation of Not and this system as delineated above. \"I am the Empress & the Hierophant. Thus eleven, as my bride is eleven.\" AL II.16 THE OLD COMMENT I am the Empress and the Hierophant (Vau) III + V = VIII, and VIII is XI, both because of the 11 letters in Abrahadabra (= 418 = ChITH = Cheth = 8), the Key Word of all this ritual and because VIII is not Leo, Strength, but Libra, Justice, in the Tarot. (see 777) MOTTA’S COMMENT Please notice that “The Empress” is written with capitals. In the previous verse the sentence starts after a period, so it is natural for the The of Empress to be in the upper case. In this verse, there is no reason for The to be capitalized unless there is a hidden meaning. There is no other instance in the entire manuscript fo the definite article being   2 Cf. A Zelator’s Aphorisms 3 Cf. Book of Lies"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"capitalized unless it stars a sentence. Hadit is emphasizing that this is a “greater Empress” that he is talking about. This is of course He, the the Star, who is not the King as A.C. thought at the time. Hadit then means simply that his name can be written HV, “The Empress & the Hierophant”. The value, of course, is 11. It should be noted that “Hu” was the oldest name that the Egyptians ascribed to the Sphinx at Gizeh. The word means Prince. ENGLISH QABALAH HV equals 11 in Hebrew and as Motta said, being Egyptian for ‘Prince’ suggests Hadit as Tiphareth and the H.G.A. HU, the actual Egyptian word in English transliteration, equals 31 in the English Qabalah, again connecting with Hadit as one of the three 31’s of Liber AL vel Legis. Symbolically, if we consider H as a ladder or connecting device that connects below (Hadit) with above (Nuit or the night sky) and we consider Nuit as Not-I or ‘you;’ the ‘U’ of HU, we again have a profound synchronicity. \"4 6 3 8 A B K 24 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V AL. What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it. But remember, o chosen one, to be me; to follow the love of Nu in the star-lit heaven; to look forth upon men, to tell them this glad word.\" AL II.76 The numbers: 4+6+3+8+24+3+24+89= 161= HORUS (H=1 O=20 R=100 U=30 S=10). The numbers: 4+6+3+8 (as the first set of numbers in the puzzle) = 21 (the number of the Tav Atu—Universe). The symbolism of A (first) B (Second) K (out) suggest the emergence of the dual nature of Ra-Hoor-Khuit; especially in light of the Starry Gnosis with the theme of the one that goes and comes—going out and coming back. There’s even a subliminal, visual impression of an Hawk with the total of all numbers in the verse supporting this idea. And so this is a story of Horus taking his orbital throne on the Sun along the ecliptic. ABK also equals 23 in the Greek Qabalah; equivalent to the word for Being. Symbolically, ALGMOR is as follows: A First L Angle G Sigh M Wave O Hail R Existence Immediately, the phonetic Qabalah gives us the idea of the word ‘algorithm’; though we don’t have anything in the word to represent the ‘th’ sound. In light of the story of the Starry Gnosis, the first coming (A-First, L-Angle and note AL is word for God) was lackluster; supported by the corresponding ‘wounding of the foot’ with G-Sigh. Note also that G can be translitered into Hebrew as Gimel that the ‘Redeemer’ comes from the Abyss, which of course, Gimel or the Camel crosses. 21 is the added value of the numbers that precede ABK and if we add the value of Gimel (3) to that, we get the number (24) that precedes ALGMOR. Three also alludes to the tri-fold nature of the Veil of the Negative and precedes the next segment of letters; Y (question or mystery) and X (Not). We see a clear allusion to human DNA as connected to this zodiacal ‘House of God’; the ‘Mystery of Not (NUIT)’, which is the ‘Mystery of Pan’ is an intricate part of this. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"If we reconnect recursively with the original 24 attributed to Gimel; also attributed to Isis, we can then examine the following number (89) by AIQ BKR reducing it to 8 or the Sephira of Venus, which is a lower arc of Isis and connected to the falling star—Lucifer. So we have a re-expression of that mystery. But together, the numbers are reduced to the number 5; bringing in the idea of humanity by recursively reconnecting with the Pentagram (the star of humanity) of the first example to these numbers that also lead to the last set of letters. Symbolically this segment of letters is presented as follows: R Existence P Expel S Curve T End at Intersection O Hail V Victory A First L Angle S represents the curve in the ecliptic that brings the expelled existence or spirt (RP) back to the beginning, which intersects with the end (T). And it was the ‘th’ sound or Tau that we missing from our phonetic examination of ALGMOR (another recursive allusion), which is now present here. The victory over the demiurge comes when we return to the beginning; the first angle (AL), which is God. Phonetically, RPSTOVAL can be pronounced as an allusion of LASHTAL. \"Thou knowest not\" becomes curious at this point. NOT=31 in the English Qabalah as described above. And yet it is NOT that will be expounded: \"There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it.\" Expound can be symbolically examined as follows: E Energy X Not P Excretion O Hail U You or Not I N Sum or Answer D dunce The initial extrapolation is ‘an examination of the awaited prophet or redeemer by his solution to the prophetic riddle’, which can also be seen as an allusion to the Riddle of the Sphinx (connected to the Starry Gnoses as shown in the section on prophecy in this work). And the idea of him being a dunce (D), clearly suggests the Fool Atu. The Key to The Book of the Law, of course, is 31, la (hence \"Liber AL\") and NOT in English. There are 30 characters in the string of letters and numbers. \"one to follow thee\"; 30+1= 31. ONE in English = 32, which is 31 +1. EXPOUND=845 in English, which is ABRAHADABRA + NOT, or 814 + 31. \"He\" shall expound it- HE =6= HAD. \"KNOW EVER\" = 777 = the expurgation of the Starry Gnosis \"But remember, O chosen one, to be me.\" ME= 11.

Note the “warrior Lord of the Forties” will “bring you to victory”. And the eighties did cower...being the emergence of certain pissants that today threaten the credibility of Thelema as a philosophical system. P=80 and symbolically refers to urination...pissants. One Final Note on AL III.47 The letters directly touched and connected by the \"line drawn\" are: S T B E T I S A Y F A. These are eleven letters altogether (the number of Magick). And their numeration in this system is 444, the holy number of Chesed, attributed to Jupiter, the King. This is the highest human attainment, but also the failure of the Abyss for the Adeptus Exemptus. We might consider this the squaring of the circle \"in its failure.\" That the circle with the cross inside it is an inversion of the Rosy Cross seems significant as the failed Babe of the Abyss then deems him or herself as the only god, instead of seeing the same kingly divinity in all of humanity. S T B E T I S A Y F A in Hebrew valuation, equals 951, which reduces to 15; The Devil Atu. With 15 reducing to 6, Tiphareth, we have the circle squared. And with The Devil Atu being a path off of Tiphareth (leading to Hod), we have the failure of this circle squared as it is imbalanced; coming off the most perfectly balanced of all the Sephiroth. 951 gives us the Hebrew word (Sepher Torah), which in the Sepher Sephiroth, is translated as The Book of the Law! "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Liber XXVII vel EQ Publication in Class C by Frater Abraxas Introduction This present work is both a response and a continuation of the work on the English Qabalah initiated by Frater Zephyros in Liber 805 vel EQ. The purpose of this work is not to demonstrate the validity of the English Qabalah derived in Liber 805; anyone seeking the proofs of this system should consult that work itself; and it is recommended to read that work before reading this one since the developments in this work are built upon the foundations of the former. Therefore I have included a copy of this work in the appendix section to facilitate this. In Liber 805 Frater Zephyros discusses the difficulties faced by Crowley and latter Thelemnites at developing an EQ as mandated in Liber Al: AL II.55: \"Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto.\" Crowley had set about this and claimed to have achieved this task through his reception of Liber Trigrammaton, which he felt provided the skeleton for the new symbols to be attributed to the English letters. The problem is that he realized his theoretical attribution of the letters to the Trigrams was not workable; giving neither an order nor a value of the letters. Here is the following comment that he wrote in response to the aforementioned verse of Liber Al: 55. Next, he set me a fresh task. I was to assign values to English letters of some such order as obtains in Hebrew. I deal fully with this matter elsewhere4. THE OLD COMMENT Done. See Liber Trigrammaton, Comment. THE NEW COMMENT The attribution in Liber Trigrammation is good theoretically; but no Qabalah of merit has arisen therefrom. (Surely it is a little early for that; a good Qabalah may take a few hundred years to unfold.) [The italics are from Motta here.] I am inclined to look further into the question of Sanskrit Roots, and into the Enochian Records, in order to put this matter in more polished shape.(Cf: Liber Al Commented) Many Thelemnites including Frater Zephyros have questioned whether or not Trigrammaton really did provide an adequate framework by which to attribute new symbols to the English alphabet. It is the goal of this work to show that Crowley did in fact fulfill the prophecy in Liber Al, by receiving Trigrammaton and that the symbols in Trigrammaton provide new Heiroglyphs for an English Qabalah along with clues as to how the order and value should be obtained. Here, I will endeavor to show that the number of Trigrams in Trigrammaton actually validates the method by which the order and value of the English Alphabet is obtained in Liber 805. This work will also endeavor to demonstrate how the connotations of the letters in   "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"English American culture compliment the ideas suggested by the trigrams and their holy verses when they follow this ordering. In Liber 805 the order of the English Alphabet was obtained in the same manner as the order of the letters in the Hebrew Qabalah. This is a credible maneuver from the start since the Hebrew Qabalah is easily considered one of the most complete and elementary works on Qabalah, and it has set the normative standards of operation for the other ‘Qabalahs’ such as the Greek and Enochian variations. Another important point in favor of mirroring the Hebrew method of obtaining the order of the letters is that, “They [the Jews] have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.” Al. 1.47. This suggests that the methods used to acquire the order and value in the Jewish Qabalah may be used to set the standard by which Thelemic culture is to develop its own system. It also suggests that any Thelemic Qabalah should appear as a mirror image of the Hebrew one in other respects such as it’s gematria. The fact that much of the gematria produced by the EQ of Liber 805 provides a thrashrq of the values of its holy words in the Hebrew testifies to this. The most compelling example of this occurs with the word ABRAHADABRA which is valued at 418 in the Hebrew Qabalah and 814 in the EQ. This along with many other variations discussed in Liber 805 provides compelling evidence that this EQ fits the bill for being the other half of the Jews spoken of in Liber Al. Liber 805 imitates the Hebraic tradition by looking for the order and value of the English alphabet in the Book of the Law itself. This is fitting since it is in the context of Thelema and its central revelation that such value would have any meaning. Zephyros explains that: “The Hebrews started at the beginning (Berashith). By comparison; we have the first verses to the Book of the Law. The sequential order of the English letters as they make their first appearance in the tome is now a parallel idea.” (Cf: Zephyros Liber 805) The order obtained by this method appears thus: H A D T E M N I F S O U V L G C P Y R W B K J Z X Q This arrangement is arrived at from counting the natural order of the letters, and Frater Zephyros points out the significance of the fact that it is only in the first chapter (the beginning) in which all twenty six letter of this alphabet are utilized. This order is then utilized to assign an appropriate number to each letter based on its placement in the series and following the Hebrew and Greek pattern of going from 1 to 10 to 20, 30, 40... and from 90 to 100, and up. Thus we have: H=1 A=2 D=3 T=4 E=5 M=6 N=7 I=8 F=9 S=10 O=20 U=30 V=40 L=50 G=60 C=70 P=80 R=100 W=200 B=300 K=400 J=500 Z=600 X=700 Q=800 Again for further details about how this version of the EQ is derived and to refrain from reinventing the wheel with this treatise, I strongly encourage the reader to consult Liber 805. Using this order and value of the letters presented above, I add each letter to the trigrams as part of my commentary on the book itself. I follow this order of the letters beginning with the second trigram since the first trigram portrays silence and hence the period from the written English. This is the first key to matching the letters with the trigrams, and the commentary in the remainder of this work is based on the connection between the ideas portrayed by the trigrams, the verses of the book itself, and the association of ideas attributed to the alphabet through our English culture. Since the goal of this work is to show how the trigrams and verses of Trigrammaton can provide a Thelemic book of Hermes much in the same way as the Tarot in relation to the Hebrew alphabet, I have also explored some possible connections existing between the Tarot trumps in addition to the English alphabet. The foundation for the suggested correspondences are based on the meaning suggested by the verses of Trigrammaton itself rather than a rigid adherence to the correspondences worked out in Liber 777 between the traditional trigrams of the I-ching and Western Hermeticism. It is important to remember that the trigrams of Trigrammaton comprise a unique system of symbols that is self defined by the holy verses which may share in some of the ideas from the I-ching, yet it is a distinct and comprehensive pentacle in its own right. Final appeal for symbolic meaning should be within the context of the book itself with any overlapping Chinese ideas being secondary sources of authority in our Hermeneutical exegesis. Again I"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"emphasize, Liber Trigrammaton is not the I-ching. While eight of the symbols might be shared, the other nineteen are wholly unique which will in turn have a differentiating effect on those common eight since they are now part of a much larger and different mythos. The idea here is to look at the trigrams in reference to their natural shape, its following holy verse, and the context of the surrounding symbols and shapes. Then we can use our knowledge from other systems to fill in any gaps and provide further elaboration on this Thelemic system. The important thing to remember is that we are dealing with Thelema, not Taoism, as the idiom of our mythos. It is true, there is much of Thelema that overlaps with Taoism; however Thelema is a distinct magickal current with its own context of meaning and a unique symbolic mythology. While some of the Tarot attributions may not match the traditional astrological and Qabalistic correspondences given to the I-ching in Liber 777; it is fairly easy to see how they correspond with the themes set out in the holy verses themselves. Here is an example of a set of correspondences listed in the commentary: * --- = D: dunce, to divide. The Emperor Atu: as in to ‘divide and conquer.’ * The verse follows as: “Also the purity was divided by strength, the force of the Demiurge.” (Trigrammaton l. 4) (Note: Brute strength is often associated with stupidity in our culture. The Emperor is also a martial figure who is creative since he institutes ‘Law’; he is also the demiurge since he is a false god in the sense of his claim to divine right in exclusion to the divinity of others.) While the commentary part of this work identifies how the trigrams provide a workable series of symbols in the EQ, it is also pertinent to look at the importance of the number 27 as it provides both a key to the hieroglyphs of the EQ and acts as a light in understanding the role of the Trigrams in relation to the whole of Thelemic doctrine. There is much to be said about the number 27 in regard to both the EQ, and as a link between Trigrammaton and Liber Al vel Legis. The central observation informing this treatise is the fact that it takes 27 verses in the first chapter of Liber Al to derive the order of the entire English Alphabet and this is the total number of Trigrams and verses that occur in Liber Trigrammaton. This exploration into the number 27 began to expand with my response to a group e-mail post concerning H.P. Blavatsky’s discussion of the Septenary. This occurred on the nineteenth of April 2008 e.v. In this posting Frater Apollonius posted the following quotation from HPB’s Secret Doctrine: But number seven, or the heptagon, the Pythagoreans considered to be a religious and perfect number. It was called \"Telesphoros,\" because by it all in the Universe and mankind is led to its end, i.e., its culmination (Philo. de Mund. opif.). Being under the rule of seven sacred planets (The seven planets are not limited to this number because the ancients knew of no others, but simply because they were the primitive or primordial houses of the seven Logoi. There may be nine and ninety-nine other planets discovered -- this does not alter the fact of these seven alone being sacred.), the doctrine of the Spheres shows, from Lemuria to Pythagoras, the seven powers of terrestrial and sublunary nature, as well as the seven great Forces of the Universe, proceeding and evolving in seven tones, which are the seven notes of the musical scale. The heptad (our Septenary) was regarded \"as the number of a virgin, because it is unborn\" (like the Logos or the \"Aja\" of the Vedantins); \"without a father or a mother, but proceeding directly from the Monad, which is the origin and crown of all things.\" (Pythag. Triangle, p. 174.) And if the heptad is made to proceed from the Monad directly, then it is, as taught in the Secret Doctrine of the oldest schools, the perfect and sacred number of this Maha-Manvantara of ours. I became interested in this discussion when Apollonius commented on this passage with the following: I have often wondered whether or not the number seven would be sacred had we known about Uranus, Neptune and Pluto all those aeons ago. And I still sometimes wonder what would the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"whole scheme have been had our solar system been composed in an entirely different manner...or for that matter, how well it would hold up should humanity find itself emigrating to other planets and solar systems. This seems to provide something of an answer in Pythagoras' commentary that the number would remain sacred; no matter that \"nine and ninety-nine other planets [be] discovered.\" Together this adds to 108, which has its own signifcance; cf. my article: Gnostic Cycles, wherein I write: Note also that the Aeon of Aquarius will start in 2597ev when the Earth’s ‘Vernal Point’ will for the first time, be in Aquarius, 693 years after the revelation of Liber AL vel Legis! And the Sun will find alignment with the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, symbolized by the Nile in the Egyptian Gnosis in 2012ev, 108 years after the start of the Aeon of Horus. 108 of course, reduces to 9 by AIQ BKR but more interestingly is thrice 23, which is why 108 is usually the number of beads on a rosary; a hint back to the Rosicrucian truth and it is also the number of beads on the Mala that Yoga students wear. (Apollonius 19/04/08 e.v.) This reflection sparked my curiosity since I was already looking into the number 27 as a possible link between Liber Trigrammaton, the EQ, and Liber Al vel Legis. The fact that the number 27 was involved in the equation 23=108 lead me to inquire further into the possible relationships that this number might have since it was already involved in another significant number of much more universal import: 108. This lead to what I still perceive to be a very interesting and useful discovery described in my following response: This is very interesting; since it ties in with my recent reflections on Liber Trigrammaton. The three cubed gives us 27, the number of verses in Liber AL required to derive the English Qabalah. It is also the number of Trigrams used in Trigrammaton. If we consider Liber Trigrammaton as a possible basis for a Thelemic Book of Hermes comprising the paths on a Thelemic tree of Life, it may be that 108 as expressed as 2 squared x three cubed expresses the archetypes of the Thelemic gnosis (Trigrammaton) multiplied and manifested through the structures of matter, i.e. 2. squared, =4 x 3 cubed = 27 = 9 portrays the squaring of the circle, due to the circular nature of nine. Also 27 is 9x3 which is 93 or 39, hence the connection between the EQ and the half of the Jews, via Hebrew Qabalah. Also 27 is the Thrasraq of 72, Shemhamphorash, the divided name of the Hebrew Qabalah, also the zodiac, Chokmah, thus the archetypes of the creative word. (19/04/08 e.v.)  Frater Apollonius continues to explore this issue by quoting his work Gnostic Cycles: The reduction to 9 then also becomes a key to the nature of our Solar System. And as will be shown, a key to the nature of the present Manifestation, which is ruled by Sagittarius. Also 23=6 or Tiphareth or the Sun. Note the Sun (6) is 93 million miles from the Earth; another recursion of 693. The diameter of the Sun is also about 108 times the Earth's diameter and the distance between the Earth and Moon is about 108 times the Moon's diameter. The Qabalistic findings in this passage are quite significant since 93, the number of will and love in Greek gematria, and the number of one of the spellings of Aiwass in Hebrew, shows that the law of Thelema is the current or path between the earth and the sun, which Qabalistically signifies the path between Malkuth and Tiphareth, or the communication between the lower Ego and the higher ego. The fact that the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel takes place in Tiphareth suggests that 93 is the current by which Human kind is initiated or raised up to a higher level of consciousness. With 27 as the product of 9 and 3 we get the archetypal forces that bear the light of that current to the sensory perceptions of the Nephesch in Malkuth. This would be the means by which the current makes itself intelligible to the sphere of sensation and the lower ego. Another important point is that the moon, the planet of Yesod, acts as the astral mediator between Malkuth and Tiphareth since it is the moon and its connection with astral sensitivity that gives us the subtle impressions by which we are able to make contact with the higher planes. It is through the moon that the light of the sun is refracted in its color spectrum giving us the ‘treasure house of images’ and hieroglyphs by which our divinations are made possible. Even our physical moon is connected with the number 27 since it takes 27.3 earth days to make a complete rotation on its axis and in time of its orbit of the earth itself, thus suggesting that the number 27 is a significant number revealing the astral symbols by which the light of the 93 current is made intelligible to the human race at this time. It is also useful to consider that 27 divided by 3 is 9 the number of Yesod while 39 which equals ‘Not I’ in the EQ is a thrasrq of 93!. Therefore the number 27 provides a further key by which new symbols may be attributed to the English alphabet in the evolution of"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"a Thelemic Qabalah. These 27 Trigrams in Trigrammaton provide a compelling elaboration on the already existing associations given to our alphabet in American English culture, as the order of the letters in the EQ naturally falls on the Trigrams. This will now be explored in depth with the following commentary. Liber Trigrammaton sub Figura XXVII Being the Book of the Trigrams of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang (1/0) * * * Here is Nothing under its three forms. It is not, yet informeth all things. This is the first cause of the universe; it is the prakrti or universal matter equilibrated: it is Purusa (the cosmic man) revealed. It is immaterial insofar as it is not, yet its non manifest state is due to the perfect equilibrium of its three constituents or gunas being sattvas, tamas, and rajas. Hence the three fold nature of this symbol and the absolute as indicated by the Ain Soph Aur in the Hebrew Qabalah. It is important to remember that these constituents are in a non manifest state at this point and that Nothing is really no-thing, matter in its absolute simplicity. It is also a reference to the Ain since it is naught. Hence the alchemical symbol of the snake devouring its own tail. It informs all things since it is the stuff from which everything else is but a modification: it is the quintessence, the un-carved block of the Taoists. [Silence, the Period, and Qabalistic zero] In terms of the English Qabalah, the first trigram is assigned to the period, since the period is silence, which is the 27th part of the English alphabet in so far as silence is an integral part of our written form of communication. The three dots of the trigram refer to the period, which can either be a brief pause as at the end of a standard sentence or a long pause of implication... such as when three periods are used to break a statement and induce a mental state of reflection. The Fool This trigram suggests the Fool Atu in the Holy Tarot since the Fool is both one by its association with the Hebrew Aleph which equals 1 in the Hebrew Qabalah. This is analogous to that sense of oneness associated with the point signified by the period itself. Yet the three dots indicate nothingness in its three forms, thus the negative veils of existence and Keter are simultaneously referred to here. The Fool is also valued as zero in the system of the Tarot itself, thus we have nothingness, or better yet, no-thingness; not as a negation, but as a unique state of being devoid of any particular, limiting qualities. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"(2/1) * * --- Now cometh the glory of the Single One, as an imperfection and stain. The glory of the single one is the brilliance of the LVX, the divine light of nature and creation. This is the first departure from equilibrium since the silence of no-thing-ness must now be broken in order to express a particular idea. This departure from silence begins with the establishment of a creative potential. A tendency or a verge to motion which is the creative impulse; this creative impulse can imply the Fool on one level, while its creative nature indicates the Magus Atu on another. The idea of a single thing, a potentiality has now been introduced. This is indicated by the solid line appearing below the three points. [The letter H with the value of 1 in the EQ] The letter H suggests the arising of the breath, in a way it suggests the breath of God, the Elohim passing over the Chaotic waters of genesis. The H also expresses the idea of a ladder in its shape, so here we have a connecting point. The H is assigned the number one being the first English letter to appear in the Book of the Law, thus the singularity is the holy spirit of creation acting as a ladder to the purity of no-thing-ness; or rather, energetic matter in its equilibrated state. One could also add that it is the breath of spirit which ruffles the equilibrium leading to manifestation. This breath refers to the prana or chi, as that electric component of the ether which moves the prime matter into its particular forms. The Magus This idea of a single thing as the modus of creation suggests a primal creator analogous to the creativity expressed in the Magus Atu of the Tarot. The Magus is the creative Word and the subtle electric force informing all things, its subtlety and occult nature is similar to that expressed in this trigram. In the Book of Thoth Crowley explains that: “...He is the messenger of the gods, represents precisely that Lingam, the Word of creation whose speech is silence.”(Crowley p.70) He adds: “He is, in the language of modern physics, that electric charge which is the first manifestation of the ring of ten indefinable ideas, as previously explained. He is thus continuous creation.” (Cf: Crowley p. 70) (3/2) * * - - But by the Weak One the Mother was it equilibrated. Here the positive assertion of a nameless something, that idea of existence in general given in the last symbol is now equilibrated with its opposite idea. Crowley often asserts that above the abyss each idea contains and necessarily asserts its own contradiction: for instance one cannot have even the most basic undefined sensation of ‘I’ or ‘me’ without accepting the awareness of that which is ‘not I’. So here we have the idea of negative existence introduced as the condition of all positive existence. This is a different kind of ‘not’ however, unlike the silence of no-thing introduced by ‘nothing in its three forms’ we now have ‘not’ as the negation of a given thing. This however occurs on a much more universal and broader level since we are dealing with existence and non existence in general, the universal archetype informing the existence and non-existence of all particular things."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"[The letter A with the value of 2 in the EQ] The value of the number two connotes femininity since it is an even number capable of absorbing the masculine potencies of odd numbers such as the number one. The letter A connotes a sense of beginning and excellence suggesting that the logos can only begin to manifest itself in the presence of both opposites, thus invoking the necessity of equilibrium in all magickal operations. The shape of this letter suggests man as the pentagram who’s fulfilled potential is excellence. His consciousness is the feminine vessel which equilibrates that light. The Empress The Empress seems to support the ideas expressed in this particular verse, since she is the ‘mother’ and it is she who provides the gate or doorway to manifestation and initiation. (4/3) * --- * Also the purity was divided by Strength, the force of the Demiurge. If we picture the two contraries just discussed, that is the archetypal positive and negative forces as arising on a continuum, like the poles of a magnet, we can see that there is no strict division between opposites introduced: just opposite yet complimentary ideas. Now the Demiurge as the Gnostic creator god or the grand architect only begins creation once the idea of division is introduced. The strength referred to here is analogous to the creative power, much like the creative maya which is magickally projected as an expression of Shiva’s potency when he creates the universe in certain Hindu legends. Here it is helpful to refer to Liber Al vel Legis. In chapter one Nuit says: “For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union.” (ch. 1: l.29) And she adds: “This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.” (Cf: Al: ch.1 l.30) Following this she prescribes the following moral injunction: “For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all!...” (l. 31) This is what differs the master of the Temple from the Black brother: the Master of the Temple is open about this selfishness and asserts it as enlightened self interest, while the black brother hides behind a façade of humility and selflessness as we will see when we look at the tenth trigram. [The letter D with the value of 3 in the EQ] This is one of the most obvious attributions since the letter ‘D’ suggests division. Also note that the letter ‘D’ can also connote ‘dunce’ within English nomenclature suggesting an ignorant quality as being part of the creative strength of the demiurge. This also deals with the themes of Liber Al in which power is associated with a-rationality: “If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops &does nought.” (Cf: Al: ch. 2 l. 30) The Emperor I associate the Emperor Atu in the Tarot with this trigram since the emperor suggests the intuitive logic used by those powerful leaders that are able to make those split second (and often arbitrary) ‘executive decisions’. The Emperor suggests strength, and the strength of will to ‘divide and conquer’ a quality associated with rulers throughout the ages."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"(5/4) * - - * And the Cross was formulated in the Universe that as yet was not. This division automatically gives rise to an underlying structure of equilibrium informing the universe as it is created by pure will. This implies the cross which portrays an underlying integral structure upon which all etheric manifestations are based. It implies law and equilibrium and it is this principle that informs our sense of ‘karma’ which is not concerned with morality in the personal sentimental sense, but with simple cause and effect. In our imagination we can have whatever we want, yet we cannot create anything in our imagination without establishing denotative limits. To imagine a circle implies that it is not a square. If you define a triangle as a three sided shape then you cannot imagine a four sided triangle. Nothing can be created without these preliminary parameters; similarly even though a game is just a game, one still needs to invent rules in order to give a game its particular character. Thus the rules we encounter in the ‘world’ reflect more conditions of the human mind: this means rules for interpreting and perceiving the world in a way that is intelligible to our consciousness. Thus natural law as ‘cause’ or ‘because’ described in Liber Al is an effect of Will not the other way around as vulgar science would have us believe. Hume says reason is a slave to the passions. The silent self in Liber Al vel Legis exclaims: “Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite and unknown; and all their words are skew-wise.” (l.32) and “Enough of because! Be he damned for a dog!” (Cf: Al: ch.2 l.33) [The letter T with the value of 4 in the EQ] The significance of the letter ‘T’ is equally obvious as the significance of the previous letter. The letter T is a hieroglyph of the cross, the limiting and binding force of the universe holding all things together. The letter itself also suggests a square, hence the squaring of the circle. It also suggests an intersection, hence an assemblage point upon which our perceptions and states of consciousness take root. Adjustment I find the connection with the Adjustment Atu to be rather obvious here. Adjustment deals with that natural law of cause and effect spoken of in my first paragraph where I described the connection between karma and equilibrium. The shape of this trigram even suggests the balances held by the woman on this card. The figure holding the balances portrays that fixed part of the universe which adapts and adjusts to every action. This idea of a fixed and liberating point is best explained by the analogy of the fulcrum and the lever. The lever requires the fixing quality of the fulcrum in order to obtain the freedom of its lateral motion. Thus the pure will emanates laws and restrictions as a means toward expansion and fulfillment. (6/5) --- * * But now the Imperfection became manifest, presiding over the fading of perfection. So all of these conditions of manifestation have only occurred as un-manifest ideas; archetypes within the N.O.X. Now the universal mind focuses on a particular idea, which is the precondition for projection. The concept of being is considered now, and the divine attention or point of view is fixating on this to the exclusion of non-being. The disturbance in equilibrium has reached such a degree so as to allow a definite idea to temporarily take shape to the exclusion of its anti-thesis."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"[The letter E with the value of 5 in the EQ] Thus we have the letter ‘E’ for energy and effort, since the process of projection has begun. The point of consciousness or bud will has unconsciously fixated itself on the idea of existence through its magnetic attraction to a particular archetype, and this results in that energy underlying all being. One should also consider that this imperfection is the dynmanic energy produced by the dis-equilibrium of the prime matter initiated by the H, the breath of the second trigram being the breath of the eternal spirit. Thus Hadit is manifesting since he is the core of every star, being the motion that interpenetrates infinite space. Note that this is the sixth trigram, being the number of Had in the EQ. (7/6) - - * * Also the Woman arose, and veiled the Upper Heaven with her body of stars. When Hadit, as the dynamic point of view distinguishes itself from the Naught, the infinite space of Nuit can now be experienced since there is the beginning of subject/object distinction which makes perception and experience possible. The absolute is veiled by the infinite due to the assertion of Hadit: absolute zero has now become two. This is described in Liber Al as follows: “None, breathed the light, faint & fairy, of the stars, and two.” (ch. 1 l. 28) Notice how the letter H symbolizing the breath which follows the ‘nothingness’ described in this verse. [The letter M with the value of 6 in the EQ] Again we have the connection of Had with the letter ‘M’ valued at 6 in the EQ, and hence the first verse in Liber Al: “Had! The manifestation of Nuit.” Thus we have the introduction of Nuit.” The letter ‘M’ suggests many things in the English nomenclature: it suggests ‘mother’, hence the reference to Nuit. We also have the idea of a mountain with two peaks suggested by the shape of the letter. The mountain connects the earth to space by its penetration of the heavens, thus showing the true nature of matter as infinite space. The twin peaks also suggest the zero equals two equation of Nuit. There is also an allusion to that dreaded demon Choronzon, here by the indication of duality: thus there is a secret connection between these ideas. The Star The Star Atu makes a clear reference to Nuit, since it corresponds to Aquarius as the water bearer, and the woman on the card portrays Nuit in her aspect of aspiring to ever new manifestations of complexity. Crowley describes this card thus in the Book of Thoth: “The picture represents Nuith, our Lady of the Stars...From the golden cup she pours this ethereal water, which is also milk and oil and blood, upon her own head, indicating the eternal renewal of the categories, the inexhaustible possibilities of existence.” (Cf: Crowley p. 109) (8/7) * --- --- Now then a giant arose, of terrible strength; and asserted the Spirit in a secret rite."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The universal subject Hadit, and the Universal object Nuit have been formulating as actual beings, their combination produces Universal experience as a consequence, giving us a universal being or entity which is able to assert the absolute. This seems to be a manifestation of the ether itself as a subtle material substance forming the material substratum for all of the elements. In Column xxxviii Crowley makes reference to the elephant with its incredible strength portraying that force supporting the world. He adds that the, “Tortoise, as supporting the Elephant, hence equivalent to Atlas.” Atlas is a giant spoken of in Greek mythology said to support the entire world on his shoulders. Here the ether has manifest itself as a giant; and this giant asserts the spirit in a secret rite which may be analogous to the ritual dismemberment of Purusa, the cosmic man in Vedic myth, whose ordeal of fragmentation was part of a ritual to create the world. There is also a connection here with Adam Kadmon in the Hebrew tradition. The creation of the world asserts the spirit since it is a celebration and expression of the infinite greatness of the Naught, and it’s fulfillment. The world as infinite and ever changing complexity is a natural consequence of the Naught: in another sense it is the naught since their existence is inter-dependent. [The letter N with the value of 7 in the EQ] The letter ‘N’ suggests ‘not’, the key to the law that the Heirophant embodies while performing his secret rites. Liber AL makes this clear: “Nothing is a secret key of this law.” (ch.1 l. 46) The Heirophant The giant referred to in this verse is the cosmic elephant; it’s strength is suggested by the Heirophant Atu. One should also note that the idea of the giant here suggests the ‘prince priest the Beast’ spoken of in Liber Al: “Now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the Beast.” (ch.1 l. 15) The giant’s strength is due to the immutable force of natural law. The Heirophant knows these secret laws and is thus the one in charge of initiation; as priest he asserts ‘...the spirit in a secret rite.’ This initiator is a giant in that he is archetypal and thus all encompassing. This correspondence suggests that it is more than the portrayal of the ether as a manifest force; it suggests an intention of communication, thus a force that is animated and intelligent. (9/8) * --- - - And the Master of the Temple balancing all things arose; his stature was above the Heaven and below Earth and Hell. The master of the Temple is the archetype of the Heirophant made manifest, or rather an adept who has perfected and balanced his or her faculties to such a degree that he or she can embody and manifest these archetypal qualities to their maximum potential. The master of the temple has completely identified with the intelligent and dynamic forces of the ether, embodying both the naught and the all. He or she has given up one’s self, and yet is one’s self. There is no difference made between the conscious will and the universal will. [The letter I with the value of 8 in the EQ] The master of the temple balances all things, thus the number eight being two zero’s balanced atop each-other, while the ‘I’ indicates the paradox of self and not self. The eight also suggests the infinity symbol and the serpent, thus indicating the eternal and incorruptible nature of the true master who is one with the all. There is an important reference in the Book of the Law which adds further meaning to this numerical reference: “I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, and one in eight: which is vital, for I am none indeed.” (ch. 2 l. 15) In the context of Liber 805 one could take"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"this as a clue in reference to the EQ. ‘I’ is eight in this system of EQ as described in the quotation. Even more, this quotation combines with the theme of this letter and the trigram to shed further light on the grade of Magister Templi, since the master is perfect by virtue of being not: he is above the abyss. The letter ‘I’ is the most appropriate letter to attribute here since the master of the Temple is nothing but self. Note that this letter also suggests the phallus and the tower. By giving up one’s self during the crossing of the abyss one is accepted into the city of the pyramids and the silent self which is within all and yet above all is now identified with and made manifest within the being of the adept. It is this self who’s “...stature was above the Heaven and below Earth and Hell.” The Brothers I don’t think that this Trigram can be attributed to any of the paths of the tree of life, since it portrays a transmuted substance that transcends and contains all things; it is the completion of the Naught in manifestation. I do feel that the Atu called ‘the Lovers’ or better, ‘the Brothers’ describes the process of this initiation. Here I will quote Crowley in his Book of Thoth: “The Shedding of blood is necessary, for God did not hear the children of Eve until blood was shed....but Cain spake not with God, nor had the mark of initiation upon his brow, so that he was shunned of all men, until he had shed blood. And this blood was the blood of his brother.” I feel that the image of the brothers portrays the fulfillment of the bloody sacrifice in which the magickal child of the adept is slain during the crossing of the abyss by the force of his or her aspiration and ambition. In this instance Cain would be the inner drive towards initiation and Abel would be the purity of the perfected self produced by the work proceeding the grade of Adeptus minor. The fact that this imagery is connected with the Lover’s Atu works well here since this card is attributed to the path of Zain or the sword which connects Tiphareth, the sphere of the Adeptus minor with Binah, the resting place for the Master of the Temple. (10/9) * - - --- Against him the Brothers of the Left-hand Path, confusing the symbols. They concealed their horror [in this symbol]; for in truth they were - - --- * The Black Brothers have confused the symbols. Unlike the true master they make pretences to selflessness as a means of approaching the absolute...this however is merely pretence. They are in reality wolves in sheep’s clothing as shown by the trigram below; while their dupes buy into this passivity of ego, the Black Brothers proceed to exploit the situation by imposing their own lower ego’s over their followers. In essence they want to turn other stars into slaves that worship them as the ‘God’. Aspirants should heed the warning given in the Liber AL: “It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie...” (AL ch. 2 l.22) This symbol shows the reality of the situation: while appearing to be ‘do gooders’ on the surface, they secretly despise the divine and seek to impose their will upon it. They define God or Nature ad-nauseam according to the prejudices of their lower ego’s. They have not or cannot consider that all things are God and that the world is exactly as it should be. They appear meek and passive according to the first trigram with the passive dash above the solid, as if being vessels for the divine; in reality, they are really being passive vessels for their own character imbalances projected onto the universe. In a sense they are"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"possessed by Qliphotic forces. They are both powerful and menacing, but they lack actual existence since their sense of identity is based upon a transient fragment: a personal idea. [The letter F with the value of 9 in the EQ] The Black Brother is a failure, since he was un-able to give up himself and cross the abyss. Rather, he projects himself onto the abyss leading him to fragmentation and the second death. The ‘F’ is appropriate here since it echo’s that failure portrayed by this trigram. Further insights can also be derived by meditating on some of the other implications of this letter. The idea of taboo, and ‘fuck’, perhaps even ‘flag’ is suggested here as well. (11/10) * - - - - The master flamed forth as a star and set a guard of Water in every Abyss. Here the master has set up a Barrier so that only the worthy can pass through and acquire true power. The guard of water is death, the ego idea must be surrendered completely, this is the blind that keeps the un-worthy out since the black brothers only preach surrender to the divine as a surrender to their own egoic projections. The master of the Temple gives himself up completely to all things whatsoever, and experiences immortality therein. The blindness of the un-worthy cannot see this and will be thwarted by this guard of water. The master flames forth as a star, that is he or she is a luminous eternal being who is free from fear. [The letter S with the Value of 10 in the EQ] The letter ‘S’ suggests a snake which is associated with the element water by it’s connection with the Hanged Man Atu given in The Book of Thoth. The snake portrays the life force, yet it is that same snake that is poisonous, bringing all forms to corruption. It also alludes to the serpent of Apothis the water serpent of the Egyptian myth which destroys all with the deluge. Also the ‘S’ suggests superman in American English culture; and, it suggests money. Thus the master is the super man referred to in Nietzsche’s Will to Power, and this superman possesses true wealth. The Chariot While I don’t believe that the Master of the Temple can be equated with any particular path on the tree of life, the path of Cheth and its corresponding key of the Chariot seem most fitting here. This card refers to the sign of Cancer which is the cardinal sign for the element of water, representing the first keen on rush of the element. It is also the path connecting Binah the great mother to the severity of Gebourah. In The Book of Thoth, Crowley writes: “[It]...is thus the influence of the Supernals descending through the Veil of Water (which is blood) upon the energy of man, and so inspires it.” (Cf: Crowley p. 85) This idea of blood in connection with water signifies a connection with death and the ordeals that one must undergo in order to successfully cross the Abyss and become a Magister Templi. This is made plain in Liber Cheth: “ Thou shalt drain out thy blood that is thy life into the golden cup of her fornication. Though shalt mingle thy life with the universal life. Thou shalt keep not back one drop. Then shall thy brain be dumb, and thy heart beat no more, and all thy life shall go from thee; and thou shalt be cast out upon the midden, and the birds of the air shall feast upon thy flesh, and thy bones shall whiten in the sun.” (Cf: Liber Cheth v. 2-4) This seems to be an apt description of the guard of water referred to in this trigram. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"(12/20) --- * --- Also certain secret ones concealed the Light of Purity in themselves, protecting it from the Persecutions. There are those who are wise, yet make no pretenses to their knowledge. A paraphrase from the Tao te Ching (Dao de Ching or Tao de King) comes to mind: ‘Those who know don’t tell; those who tell don’t know...’ The presence and integrity of such individuals speaks for itself and this gnosis may be directly communicated to those pure of heart who are fortunate enough to be in the presence of such individuals. [The letter O with the value of 20 in the EQ] The letter ‘O’ suggests the yoni, an opening and a vessel capable of receiving wisdom. It also suggests a sealed vessel by which the light’s purity may be concealed. The ‘O’ adds to the sexual reference here, and indicates the joy of this purity by the suggestion of orgasm. The Hermit This trigram suggests the Hermit Atu in a number of ways. First we have the idea of secrecy and concealment from the profanity found in the multitude. Also the idea of concealing the light within oneself suggests the image of the hermit who is concealed beneath a robe and carries the light within his lantern. Crowley elaborates on this further with his version of it in the Book of Thoth in which the spermatozoon as the logos is shown as being concealed within his body. The trigram along with the letter ‘O’ suggests the same; the trigram shows the absolute safely concealed in a body as shown by the two solid lines. One would do well to refer to Liber Al in this matter: “Behold! These be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who be hermits. Now think not to find them in the forest or on the mountain; but in beds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eye’s...Ye shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy; and there shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this.” (Cf: Al: ch. 2 l. 24) (13/30) --- * - - Likewise also did certain sons and daughters of Hermes and of Aphrodite, more openly. This may be a reference to the proper applications of sexual magick in one sense due to the connection with Aphrodite, since it is a clear reference to the formula of love under will. The reference to Hermes suggests those inspired individuals who are able to ask intelligent questions about the world with the simplicity of a playful child. In combination with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, we have the idea of romantic inspiration, poetic rapture, in addition to the intuitive flashes given by Hermes as messenger of the gods. Hermes is suggested by the solid line. He conceals the secret since he is thought, and all thought is inherently false. The broken line beneath refers to Aphrodite due to its feminine nature. She conceals the secret more openly since love and ecstasy provide more ‘true’ glimpse of the absolute than thought. [The letter U with the value of 30 in the EQ]"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The shape of the letter ‘U’ suggests the womb and indicates the fertility described by this trigram. It also suggests a cup, that receptive vessel that allows us to receive the divine inspiration, the dew of immortality. One should note that in Carlos Castaneda’s Tensegrity teachings the womb is considered to be the organ that allows women to ‘see’ the energy fields of the universe. The Lovers The reference to Hermes and Aphrodite suggests a correspondence with the Lovers Atu. This card is attributed to the zodiac sign of Gemini, hence the connection with Hermes who rules the sign while Aphrodite indicates the title of the card itself. This is most suitable since it is divine love that surpasses the tricks of mercury leading to the Neschemah, our intuition. (14/40) - - * --- But the Enemy confused them. They pretended to conceal that Light, that they might betray it, and profane it. The enemy wants to hide the light since the distorted ego of the Black Brother depends on this. They are hiding this light from themselves as much as from others: to admit that all things are divine is to take away their delusion of being the only ‘God’. By hiding the light they can keep the Ruachs of their followers in a weakened state making them dependant on the Black Brother for guidance. As indicated in the earlier trigrams the Black Brother is really that consoler spoken against in Liber Al: “Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console not: I hate the consoled & the consoler.” (Cf: Al: Ch. 2 l. 48) By consoling they are really condescending and reinforcing the illusion of one being weak, and hence non-divine. The trigram itself shows this concealment, since the bottom line is solid, preventing those below from seeing that light, thus creating the illusion that it is concealed while the top line is broken, showing this apparent concealment to be false. [The Letter V with the value of 40 in the EQ] The letter ‘V’ indicates duality. The enemy of truth divides the purity into good and evil, creating a false and ultimately non-existent deity that is ‘benign’ and another entity of ‘evil’ being equally false. This premise also asserts that the Black brother’s themselves lack actual existence, since their appearance as a phenomena depends upon transient aberrations in perception. One should remember this so as not to fall down that path of paranoia that plagued Motta with his witch hunt for the Black Brothers. However, as transient as the Black Brothers may be, they can work some real mischief; Crowley used Hitler to serve as an analogy for the Black Brother in Magick Without Tears. (15/50) - - * - - Yet certain holy nuns concealed the secret in songs upon the lyre. The two broken lines indicate the femininity of the nuns, yet they may also suggest the strings of the Lyre. These are the various priestesses heard of in many mystery cults who were able to intoxicate and inspire others with their beauty and profundity of expression."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"[The letter L with the value of 50 in the EQ] The letter ‘L’ portrays the idea of law, since its shape suggests an angle or ruler. There is an emphasis here on geometric law in particular and mathematical law in general. This is appropriate since the Greek god of logic, Apollo, was also the god of music. Music bridges the gab between abstract knowledge and beauty, and the songs of these holy nun’s raise the minds of those who listen, to a level of intuitive logic. The Priestess This attribution seems rather obvious given the context that I outlined above. The connection here with the Priestess Atu, may give further insights into this trigram; since the priestess gives a direct link from the centre of the Ruach to the absolute. This suggests that the intuitive logic, and beauty of such songs is precisely what is needed to gain a safe passage across the abyss. Note also in regard to the previous comments about the M.T.; one is able to lose one’s self utterly in both love and in song. (16/60) --- --- * Now did the Horror of Time pervert all things, hiding the Purity with a loathsome thing, a thing unnameable. On the trigram itself you can see that the positive idea has now crystallized and is hiding the absolute. Time is suggested since both lines are un-broken being yang, whose nature is disruptive. The horror of time is due to its breaking up of the wholeness of the absolute as a varied, yet unbroken continuum developed thus far. This leads to a fragmented perspective causing one to identify with a particular fragment and to imagine the universe as another series of fragments. Basically one can be blinded by this; being unable to see the forest for the trees. Yet this fragmentation and motion of archetypes is an important part of the absolute itself. The negative descriptors only convey part of the truth here, and play the role of blinds for the aspirant. It is also the experience of time that causes one to experience death since time and change involve a constant cycle of creation and destruction, both necessary features of being. It is wise here to quote the aphorism: ‘change is stability’. [The letter G with the value of 60 in the EQ] The letter ‘G’ suggests the idea of ‘God’ in English culture, thus we have the manifestation of the Demi-urge. The ‘G’also suggests low tones and makes me think of the earth, perhaps Therion and Pan as well. The Wheel The allusion to the Wheel Atu is obvious here, since it is the wheel of samsara referred to by many yogic traditions in Asia. But samsara is not something to be escaped, since the wheel is a zero by its shape, being naught. This is why the more profound and esoteric schools of Buddhism claim that the highest understanding recognizes that ‘samsara is Nirvana’. The very thing that most eastern mystics set out to escape is the very thing that they are actually seeking: it is only one’s understanding that needs to change. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"(17/70) --- - - * Yea, and there arose sensualists upon the firmament, as a foul stain of storm upon the sky. The experience of time and its inherent motion is the condition for the experience of the grosser senses and their perceptions. The sensualists are those who are consumed by these perceptions to the exclusion of the Neschama, the intuitive understanding indicated previously. They only see the plethora of the changing whirling colors, and are deceived by their other senses that arise as a result of this: they are un-able to appreciate the unity and nothingness which is the essence of the phenomenon: the spontaneous combustion of love under will. Yet this is also a blind, since sensuality is the gateway to intoxication and there are two kinds of intoxication: one of blindness as observed in drunkards and derelicts, and that of inspired vision. This refers to the use of sex and the strange drugs referred to in Liber Al as a means of disrupting the mental structures that one has created in order to regain that vision of the purity: “I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge&Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, and be drunk thereof!” (Cf: Al: Ch.2 l. 22) [The letter C with the value of 70 in the EQ] The letter ‘C’ portrays an overturned cup, suggesting a wine goblet being spilt after drinking too much. The reference to sensuality is strong in this sense, yet it indicates something deeper. The divine emanates the universe in a similar manner: it concentrates upon itself until it bursts forth, as a brilliant explosion of archetypes spilling out of the vessel as a result of the ecstatic intoxication. This spilling forth of the vessels suggests the various sephiroth pouring the logos from one to the other as it manifests through the four worlds. Lust This was Crowley’s replacement for the Strength Atu in his Book of Thoth; it portrays the power of the absolute, the creative shakti concentrated into a fervent frenzy. The power of the will of the magician depends upon how much ecstasy he or she can handle, since it is through the means of ecstasy that the world of forms is projected onto the Naught. Also the pure will is founded on love, and our passion is a measure of our strength. (18/80) - - --- * And the Black Brothers raised their heads; yea, they unveiled themselves without shame or fear. It is only when individuals have been completely blinded by the grosser senses that the Black Brothers can raise their heads, since they depend upon the ignorance of others in order to maintain their lopsided existence. They are usually the one’s that are opposed to sensuality, since they know that no one can truly give it up and that by demonizing sensuality they can inhibit others from exploring it deeper and using it to open up the intuitive senses, and thus acquiring personal power. [The letter P with the value of 80 in the EQ]"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The letter ‘P’ suggests anger, as in ‘piss off’, it also suggests a flag. It further suggests a lopsided tower unable to stand on its own terms. And this is what the Black Brothers are: the world as it occurs without argument or discourse is always in glaring contradiction to their views, so they shut themselves off from reality and begin spiritual decay. (19/90) - - - - * Also there rose up a soul of filth and of weakness, and it corrupted all the rule of the Tao. Here we have the two broken lines covering up the truth of spirit. This indicates weakness since the broken lines suggest an imbalance in passivity. [The letter Y with the value of 90 in the EQ] This attribution is most fitting since its correspondence explains the weakness of this trigram perfectly in terms of Liber Al: “If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops &does nought.” “If Power asks why, then is Power weakness” (Cf: Al: ch. 2 l.30) The letter ‘Y’ suggests a question and the question ‘why’ in particular, thus uncertainty and weakness, since one is no longer relying on one’s self for direction. This passivity is usually connected with the delusion that there is an answer and a reality existing independently of one’s being (one’s will). This passivity opens one’s self up to any random impression existent in the chaos which will then manifest itself through the psyche and actions of such an individual. Magickal power and a fortified will does not care what others believe to be real. It does not ask ‘why’, it simply is, and it creates on its own terms. Such weakness is a common characteristic of those psycho-phants who follow charismatic cult leaders, and quite often the dupes of the Black Brothers since they lack certainty. Having said this it may be useful for meditation to consider some other ideas suggested by the letter ‘Y’ Here we have: choice, axis, unity, and chromosome. This idea of weakness may also have a hidden positive side: it is that dividing quality which allows things to break down and reformulate into ever new forms of complexity, hence the fulfillment of Nuit as infinite space. Death Here we have this corrupting force which on the one hand shows weakness of the soul, yet on a positive level divides for the purpose of new growth, new variation and evolution: the impetus of the pure will. The Death Atu corresponds nicely with this trigram since it portrays those corrupting forces that are the condition of growth and renewal as we spiral forth through infinite space. (20/100) --- --- --- Then only was Heaven established to bear sway; for only in the lowest corruption is form manifest. This refers to Daath, the abyss, since heaven is the highest human conception of the absolute. The important thing to remember is that it’s just a conception and not the absolute itself; it has now become a definite thing with particular qualities made accessible to the ego, making it into a construct of one form or another. The three solid lines indicate the positive assertion of a definite set of ideas."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"[The letter R with the value of 100 in the EQ] The letter ‘R’ suggests the words: roll, existence (are), and rudimentary knowledge. This is fitting since Daath on the tree of life is the hidden sephiroth of knowledge, and this would not be any knowledge, but rudimentary knowledge, the very axioms and frameworks that go un-questioned in our functioning lives. These axioms form the conditional basis for all other forms of knowledge and for our ability to experience a sensible world. Nevertheless, these axioms are arbitrary in so far as there is no further metaphysical ground for their justification: they just are. The only justification is that they formulate the universal will and thus they have pragmatic value, they are essentially the magick words expressing the will of the absolute. Art This Atu seems to correspond with the heaven trigram since it is the path of Samech leading from the moon, to the sun. The heaven trigram corresponds with Daath on the tree according to Crowley’s early arrangement of the trigrams and it has been shown in the works of Grant that Daath and Yesod are both connected as centers of consciousness. Frater Zyphros discusses this connection when he writes: “Daath then subdivides below the Abyss into Chesed and Gebourah; only to be reunited into Tiphareth. Of course this subdivides into Hod and Netzach with a re-unification in Yesod. (The combination of the two lower components of consciousness—intellect and emotion, which of course is a reflection of Daath, being the stasis of the higher components of consciousness on top of their respective counter-charged pillars on each side of the Middle Pillar.” (http://www.astronargon.us/qabalistic_magnetism.html) Here the path of Samech is the prop upon which consciousness is supported, and in another sense it is the foundation upon which the work is performed. As the archer of Sagittarius, it is the aspiration and the will of the magician directed toward something higher. As Art, it is the great work, the performance of alchemy. Heaven is really the finer part of the Azoth, which has risen upward, while the below is the crystallization of that inherent genius and its infinite archetypes. (21/200) --- --- - - Also did Heaven manifest in violent light, This trigram is the symbol of wind in the system of the I-ching. It suggests a crack between rocks allowing the wind to penetrate a great obstacle such as a mountain or a tower. The universe also manifests its wisdom by disrupting all fixed and entrenched structures. Change is the essence of all phenomena, yet certain phenomenon, particularly ideas get fixated causing a build up of pressure which gives way to a more violent change. Such violence is always enlightening if it is thorough, since it would destroy the structure entirely, thus opening one’s perception to what were previously invisible possibilities. The two upper yang lines suggest a solid structure such as rock or masonry, while the bottom yin line shows a crack. This indicated the ability of this violent light to penetrate and reveal the secrets of even the strongest of obstacles, or subjects! In this situation there are no sacred cows to be spared! To hell with P.C. thinking! To hell with new age passivity! [The letter W with the value of 200 in the EQ] The ‘W’ suggests wind; it also suggests questions as in the ‘five w’s’ used by news reporters. We also have turbulence, confusion and of course woman. Women tend to have a natural ability to disrupt a man’s fixed and limiting conceptions of himself and the world."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Tower This card is also called ‘War’, since the Tower is the herald of violent light. It symbolizes destruction of resistant and obsolete forms. It also indicates enlightenment since it corresponds with the opened eye of Shiva pictured on Crowley’s version of the card. One interpretation of this card has been the ‘...escape from prison and all that it implies...’. (Cf: Instructions for the Thoth Tarot Deck p. 12) (22/300) --- - - --- And in soft light. Some scientists speculate that the sun may in-fact be hollow and relatively cool on the inside compared to the effects of heat produced by its nuclear reaction. The idea here is that the atoms of a mature sun in a state of plasma are actually considered to be cool in comparison to the effects of heat that its reaction produces. This is interesting since the above trigram is called Li in the I-ching, referring to fire. As we can see, the two yang or fiery solid lines are external, while the central source of this heat is depicted by a broken yin line symbolizing coolness. This suggests a balanced and life sustaining fire. It is also associated with the eyes in the traditional I-ching; but Crowley’s attribution of this trigram to Tiphareth is very fitting, since it shows the light of a balanced human consciousness as the source of true seeing and knowing. [The letter B with the value of 300 in the EQ] The letter ‘B’ suggests ‘alternative’ as in plan ‘B’; a drill as in spelling ‘bee’. This letter suggests the concept of being by its phonetic resemblance to the word ‘be’ as in ‘to be’, hence existence and being. It also signifies ‘good’, since it is the grade letter for ‘good’ on a student’s report card. This may resemble Plato’s concept of the ‘good’ as the universal goodness, and its connection with fire, sight, knowledge and light tells us that the truth is the good. This is the truth which can only be found through the sight of a balanced psyche. The Sun The Sun seems fitting here; I have always considered the sun to be the word of Truth, and Law governing the human race. Crowley also hints at this in his Book of Thoth: “This is one of the simplest of the cards; it represents Heru-ra-ha, the Lord of the New Aeon, in his manifestation to the race of men as the Sun spiritual, moral, and physical.” Here it seems that heaven is the manifestation and formulation of the logos, which is the expression of the absolute: “He is the Lord of Light, Life, liberty and Love. This Aeon has for its purpose the complete emancipation of the human race.” (Crowley p. 113) (23/400) - - --- --- Then were the waters gathered together from the heaven,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The idea of waters gathering from the heaven suggests the dew of wisdom and immortality which fills the magick cup of the aspirant. This trigram is traditionally associated with pleasure in the I-ching suggesting that bliss which accompanies Samadhi. The lines suggest passive water such as a pond or a lake supported by a strong foundation of bedrock as suggested by the two bottom yang lines. The Chinese system attributes this trigram to the marsh. It seems that the waters are perfectly calm, equilibrated and passive, thus allowing a clear reflection of the heavens above and the sun of truth as it shines upon the earth; yet, such a passive state of reflection suggests a form of ego death since there is no room for an I and thou identification; such an identification would ripple the waters and refract the reflected light. [The letter K with the value of 400 in the EQ] The letter ‘K’ in the EQ suggests the idea of a strike or a knock out; one could humorously, but not all together un-accurately state that when we are knocked out, the waters of our minds are still. This could be a reference to deep dreamless sleep, which is often referred to in the Upanisads by the sages when explaining Vijnanna, that un-changing basal level of consciousness. This is a part of the self that really is conscious, yet without thought and ego distinction. One can simply prove this by going to sleep in an area surrounded by hostile forces. When one is genuinely afraid, go to sleep, and if you are in good health, your automatic consciousness will often wake you up when ever a potential threat draws near. I myself have experienced this several times, particularly while sleeping on the streets in downtown Paris. The number 400 is the sum of the following Hebrew words in gematria with the following meanings: to use magic or witchcraft; Erudiens, a title of Yesod. Here we see the idea of automatic consciousness being suggested since the Zealator who is instructed to understand his or her ‘automatic consciousness’. We also know that it is simultaneously the ether or automatic consciousness, (often called the un-conscious by hypnotists) which is the operative agent for all magick and works of fascination. But the key thing to remember is that this reflective water is only perfectly still when the idea of the lower ego is effectively knocked out. The Hanged Man This card is connected to this trigram by its attribution to the Hebrew letter Mem, which represents the element of water. Crowley writes: “It would perhaps be better to say that it represents the spiritual function of water in the economy of initiation; it is a baptism which is also a death.” Also: “That depends on the formula of the Rose and Cross, of the annihilation of the self in the Beloved, the condition of progress.” (Crowley p.96) I don’t see this card as dealing with self sacrifice; this is the illusion of the previous aeon. This card seems to indicate that surrender of the lower ego to the higher ego that occurs when one is able to balance the tendencies of the unconscious mind, reaching a level of stillness which allows a greater awareness of one’s identity to be realized. This is not the sacrifice of the ego, but its fulfillment. The apparent sense of death and loss is due to the perception of a fragment which has been mistaken for one’s identity and has now been dissolved into an awareness that provides a clear reflection of that infinite light. (24/500) --- - - - - And a crust of earth concealed the core of flame. Here we have the two broken yin lines forming the hollow tube of the logos with the solid yang forming the crust of earth. The natural reference is to the fiery metal core at the center of the earth with its surrounding magma concealed by the crystallization of its own essence as it is cooled by the extremities of the earth’s radius. If fire is spirit, then the earth is simply the crystallized image projected by spirit as it is emanated from the centre. The Chinese I-ching refers this trigram to the mountain, and this could be a reference to the sacred mountain of Abeignus in western hermeticism, since it is through concrete manifestation that we are able to experience the pursuit of perfection."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"[The letter J with the value of 500 in the EQ] The letter ‘J’ from the EQ falls naturally upon this trigram based on the order of the English alphabet found in the first twenty seven verses of Liber Al vel Legis. The shape and associations of this letter suggests the following themes in the context of our English American culture: hook, improper (as in ‘J’ walking), joint, and whip. It is through crystallized images that our psyches are able to be hooked, since we are always fooled by our senses. Earthly and bodily existence has often been associated with sin, defilement, and corruption in many Western spiritual institutions. Such references here are blinds, since the law of Thelema asserts the unity of the Spirit and the Flesh. In this sense the flesh is the rays of the sun, the glory of the absolute’s infinite variety of expression. The idea of a joint is also important since it is our common experience of having bodies of flesh that actually unites us in the end. It is the crust of earth that connects our astral bodies to the world of our consensus reality. It is also interesting to note here that the phrase ‘Lord God of the Universe’ adds up to the number 500, thus furthering this idea of a link to a larger system. The Devil The Devil Atu is fitting for a variety of reasons: first it is ruled by Capricorn and the mountain goat. Crowley expresses the symbolism of the goat quite elegantly in 777: “It is the leaping of the Goat and it’s fondness for high and barren mountains which connect it with Capricorn, the sign which represents the zenith in the zodiac.” (Cf: Crowley p. 94) If one were to accept the additional correspondence of the previously mentioned Chinese attributions of the mountain given to this trigram, we can see a connection with the idea of the phallus which again is the central theme in Crowley’s version of this card. The theme of the devil as the exoteric symbol of taboo also fits well with the ideas expressed in connection with the letter ‘J’. (25/600) - - --- - - Around the globe gathered the wide air, This trigram suggests an atom in its shape and invokes the idea of electricity. The solid yang line portrays the positive nucleus and the external yin lines indicate the outer shell of electrons. On the scale of the macrocosm this is earth being the ground which attracts any excess current built up in the surrounding atmosphere above; thus the condition for the lightening storm, or the ‘violent light’ referred to in the earlier trigram. On another level we have the idea of the womb and its amniotic fluid. The earth or globe would be Hadit, the winged globe contained in the amniotic fluid of Nuit’s womb, our atmosphere. This atmosphere has illusory properties, since it is reflective and capable of refracting the light and bending its various images. The idea of fluid is further connected with the air of our atmosphere when we look at the traditional meanings ascribed to this symbol in the I-ching: dangerous waters and the moon. Here the yang is completely engulfed in the yin, so there is risk of drowning in these waters; the moon is the planet of Yesod which deals with the airy portion of the astral plane and the menstral fluid of the universal substance. The dual symbolism of water and air encountered in this trigram suggest that it is the creative astral light which surrounds the monad making it cape-able of an electrical charge hence it is written: “Now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the Beast: and in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is all power given.” (Cf: Al: ch. 1 l. 15) This ‘wide air’ signifies that electrical power that is given to the scarlet woman and it is she like the earth’s electromagnetic field which surrounds the globe. [The letter Z with the value of 600 in the EQ]"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The letter ‘Z’ further supports the ideas of electricity and the astral light since it suggests sleep, that somnambulist state which mediums enter when dealing with this light. (Cf: The Sleep of Siloam.) This letter also suggests electricity, especially lightening by it’s shape. The number of this letter, 600 is also the sum of the English word for brilliance in the EQ. The Moon The Moon Atu is associated with illusion, and sorcery all lower functions of the astral light. It represents the sun’s passage through the blindness of night, hence its connection with sleep and the letter ‘Z’. The moon corresponds with the Chinese attribution of the moon to this trigram, and the dangers of the Moon Atu are commensurate with the dangers suggested by the trigram as it is found in the I-ching. The sun’s immersion into the illusion and blindness of the night is analogous to the yang line being completely engulfed by the darkness of the two surrounding yin lines, hence the possibility of reasoning and commonsense being consumed by the forces of the unconscious. Yet despite all of these dangers this is where the work has to take place since it is here that the subtle substance of the astral light can be found and it is our work on this primal substance that is paramount to spiritual transformation. (26/700) - - - - --- And men began to light fires upon the earth. Like all of the other lines this line can indicate many things depending on the context in which the archetype takes form. In one instance it is the lightening hitting the earth as the electric current is polarized in the astral atmosphere. This can manifest as greater knowledge and a new renaissance if people are open to this level of creative energy or it can lead to destructive fires upon the earth if the creative veins are closed off. Either way the energy of this polarized current is going to manifest; it depends which channels are made available for manifestation: it’s either Eros or Thanatos as Freud and Schopenhauer would put it. The important point here is the reference to the word ‘men’. It is through the medium of men [humans to keep it pc!] that this excess of prana manifests the astral archetypes on the earth. The fire is inspiration and genius and can manifest through the fire of creative insights and cultural heights. It can also manifest as gross fire and destruction as this inspiration is directed through our destructive tendencies. If a culture is conditioned to value beauty, intellect, and pro-creative pursuits the energy is likely to flow in this direction. The values of the cultures involved will determine the nature of the archetypes that these energies are most attracted to. Either way it will be electric and explosive in nature since these fires are the result of the static electricity that has accumulated in the atmosphere of the collective unconscious, and it will manifest. [The letter X with the value of 700 in the EQ] The letter ‘X’ suggests the chromosome, particularly the neutral chromosome shared by both sexes. It also signifies the axis point upon which a rotation or lever makes its motion. Other ideas include: to remove, destination, cross, kiss, or target. Finally this may be a reference to the ‘...winners of the Ordeal x.” referred to in chapter three of Liber Al. Thus we have the point of motion or manifestation which would be a kiss of the gods, since it is the power of the gods descending upon the earth via the actions of human beings which perpetuates our culture and our universe due to its connection with the chromosome, and this creative act will produce a simultaneous effect of destruction. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Aeon An ideal description of this fiery rapture is the Aeon Atu, since it characterizes the equinox of the Gods and the inauguration of the new eon of Horus through the Master Therion’s reception of Liber Al vel Legis. It signifies a new chapter in the mass consciousness of the human race and a renaissance of thought and technology in our culture today; following this wake is the destruction of our previous conceptions and the fires of warfare as the remnants of these beliefs resist the new paradigm both within our global culture at large and within our individual psyche’s. We don’t need to look far to see the various fires that have been set ablaze on our earth. The old card was called “The Angel: or The Last Judgment. It represented an Angel or Messenger blowing a trumpet... below him the graves were opening, the dead rising up.” (Crowley p. 115) Crowley changed this card since the New Aeon and last judgment has already come with the reception of The Book of the Law. So the last judgment depicted by the angel in the old deck is now better portrayed as the Aeon in today’s deck since history has effectively moved on. (27/800) - - - - - - Therefore was the end of it sorrow; yet in that sorrow a sixfold star of glory whereby they might see to return unto the stainless Abode; yea, unto the Stainless Abode. This Sorrow is the emptiness suggested by the hollow created by the three broken lines, suggesting a chasm and in one sense a beginning-less and bottom-less pit. This is ‘the pit called because’ where one mistakes the particulates of the manifest universe to be part of a linear chain of cause and effect. This is false, since there is just the infinite motion of the pure will with no beginning and end; and this Will, like all other internal powers cannot be quantified. The Nihilistic conception of the universe only arises when it is comprehended by its eternal and fragmented images in exclusion to the varied waves of feeling that make up the interior perception of the human being. If one were to recognize the connection between the fragmented parts and intuited waves of energy, as two sides of the same coin, we would then see that ‘sixfold star of glory’ the macrocosm, the face of ‘God’ and our own starry nature. This starry nature is portrayed by the six broken lines. In this sense this earth Trigram from the I-ching portrays the ‘nothingness with twinkles’ that Crowley spoke of in his vision of the star sponge.(Cf: The Law is for All p. 79) The Six broken lines being the twinkles and the spaces the nothingness; thus the sorrow of the manifested universe arises from our in-ability to see it in it’s totality, leading to a dreadful materialism of ‘dead isolated matter’ in the case of Newton and then to the Nihilism described by Sartre and Nietzsche. We also need to remember that this trigram is the trigram of the earth, mother, and the belly according to the traditional I-ching, hence the connection with Babalon and Binah. The fact that this trigram occurs at the end of the sequence suggests that it contains the totality of expressions analogous to malkuth in which the sorrow of the great mother is reflected. [The letter Q with the value of 800 in the EQ] The letter ‘Q’ is appropriate here since it provides one of the most accurate and simplest of hieroglyphs for the totality of being. In American English culture ‘Q’ suggests a question, a paradox, riddle, negation, the empty set, total capacity and the quotient in long division. The longer a mystic meditates the more he or she will discover all of the above to be true. More importantly the letter ‘Q’ portrays the phallus and the yoni conjoined, suggesting that in its entirety the universe is neither a positive nor a negative idea since it contains both. Also this letter has the value of 800 in the EQ, which is the value of the Hebrew word Qshth, a bow containing the three paths leading from Malkuth; this is also a reference to the rainbow of promise. The manifested universe contains all the promise of the Ain Soph since it is the Ain Soph itself"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" manifested in visible appearance. For those unable to perceive the universe as a whole, it seems limited, but to those initiates who see the Ain Soph in the material world itself will see infinite promise in the world as it is, due to its limitless possibilities. The Universe This seems to be the most obvious of the corresponding Atu’s for this trigram. The pure feminine passivity of the K’un trigram is an expression of the manifest universe itself. This passivity is an appropriate description of the universe since it is but an infinite field of matter/energy matrixes impressed upon by the interior forces of will and intelligence as they occur in nature. The sorrow described in the verse of the trigram corresponds nicely since the Universe Atu is the path of Tau connecting Malkuth to Yesod. Malkuth reflects the sorrow of the Great Mother, while the attribution of Saturn to the path of Tau seems to transmit that sorrow from Binah to Malkuth, since Saturn is attributed to Binah. In the Hebrew Qabalah we also know that Aleph (the beginning) combined with Tau (the end) makes the word Ath, meaning ‘Essence’. (Cf: Book of Thoth, Crowley p. 117) Applications There are many possible applications for this attribution of the Trigrams to the English letters. The most obvious being further elucidation of the Book of the Law itself. The Trigrams can be used in a similar fashion as the English letters as demonstrated in Liber 805 where each letter or Trigram of a word is interpreted together to give a deeper insight into its magickal meaning. Since there are twenty seven trigrams, one can also experiment with attributing a given Trigram to any number between one and twenty seven that is obtained when adding the cross sum of a given English word. It is also possible to perform personal divinations using these symbols. All one needs to do is agree upon an arbitrary, yet consistent means at acquiring one of the symbols or a number between one and twenty seven by which symbols can be derived. If one performs such a maneuver while making a firm dharana on the question at hand one can produce any number of appropriate symbols to give relevant insight into a particular situation. Of course this opens up a whole new avenue of research in divination to be explored, which would be better taken up in a separate treatise either by myself, or who ever else chooses to do research along these lines. Here I have included some examples of how the trigrams can be used to squeeze additional magickal meanings out of English words and god names by their attribution to the letters. These examples are intended to spark further investigations, and I strongly encourage any aspirants who are interested in this approach to take things beyond where I have left off. Since I do not currently have a program that allows me to reproduce the trigrams corresponding with the English letters in small type, and to do so by means of stars and dashes is too cumber some, we will have to settle for producing the acronyms from the English letters themselves. Here one can simply write out the English alphabet on paper and add the corresponding Trigrams listed in the commentary; then it is recommended to write in these Trigrams beside each letter in the words presented here in order to follow the Trigrams which I derive my meanings from. As the reader will see, the meaning that I draw from the Trigrams for each word is primarily based on the holy verses written beside each trigram in Liber Trigrammaton itself. Here are some examples of the Trigrams in action for deriving further meaning from the text: N U I T: The spirit is asserted by the sons and daughters of the gods, being balanced by the master on the cross.

Note that Lashtal adds up to 119, thus: Nothing is the nature of the Magister Templi. Another consideration is that 119 is 11 and 9 with 11 being the number of Nuit and all magick, while 9 is the number of Hadit to he fools: “For I am perfect being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, and one in eight which is vital for I am none indeed.” (Al: ch2 l. 15) Remember that ‘I’ equals eight in the EQ and is the Master of Temple. The reference to the fool may refer to the transition point between magus which is 9=2 in Chokmah and the Ipsisimus being 10=1 in Keter: the Hebrew letter Aleph and the Fool Atu constitute the path between these two sephiroth. One can also consider the 11th and 9th trigrams for further insights. Thus 11= “Also certain secret ones concealed the Light of Purity in themselves, protecting it from the Persecutions.” While 9= “And the Master of the Temple balancing all things arose; his stature was above the Heaven and below Earth and Hell.” This adds to the secrecy implied by this grade and the connection involving the self with absolute. A Concluding Remark This work is intended as food for thought in the on going development of a Thelemic Qabalah and is not to be taken as a final authority since the Qabalah will always be a dynamic and evolving system. However, I do feel that this work speaks for itself and that the synchronicities demonstrated in this work make this presentation a very compelling piece of Qablistic thought in our collective endeavor to develop the Thelemic mythos.

Perhaps in his confusion what he didn’t see too clearly is that the letters of this book are what are important as much as the mystical meaning. He just wasn’t looking at the issue from the proper perspective. The ampersand is a sideways view of the crown of Osiris. Osiris was cut into 14 pieces by Set. Set is the force of the black brothers. Osiris was destroyed by him just as Christianity was destroyed by Paul and Catholicism. Isis goes out to find the pieces and revive him with her magick, but returns with only 13. The 14th is his foreskin. In memory of this loss they placed the image of the foreskin on Osiris' head as a crown. Now that the practice of circumcision is winding down (as are the slave religions), the ampersand, the sign of physical love has returned to its place (the Tower). We are Horus, we are taking revenge on these Setian Christists. Isis whored herself to Set to produce a child who would destroy him.

And I lift up my voice and curse with the Great Curse of a Magus of Power him that shall seek to turn my Word from its Truth. Note that it is with the curse of the Magus 9º=2□/Chokmah that Crowley aligns with the wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Further, he states that such wisdom is an “open, not initiated wisdom.” Hence, we find that both the order & value, as well as the symbols attributed have been found openly displayed in the phenomenal world before us. And therefore, must fall in the egregore of this curse and the protection that it provides. Ra-Hoor-Khuit declares himself in Liber AL to be a god of vengeance that “shall deal hardly with them”—taking his revenge; a word that equals 222 and is the formulaic or magickal ‘word’ of the ‘curse.’ And that we must go through 27 verses of AL to get the numeration of the letters, we find also that 27 is the value of the word ‘no’—hidden openly in NOT, which is the key to AL (31), as described in Liber 805. That there are things hidden in these letters of AL, we find again, a key in 27; being also the value of the word ‘hidden.’ 27+27 equals 54; AL:I.54 is quoted above as the first of three verses that deal with the prophecy of a child; the next being: “The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them.”—AL:I.55 "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"And though Crowley at first, found in Achad, the prophesied child, it was through Achad’s failure that he later came to write: “I believe that many candidates may appear” and “that there is more than one 'child'.” And there have been several involved in the work of 805 since its earliest inception. \"Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected house cometh that child.

According to http://hotword.dictionary.com/ampersand/: Traditionally, in English-speaking schools when reciting the alphabet, any letter that could also be used as a word in itself (\"A\", \"I\", and, at one point, \"O\") was preceded by the Latin expression per se (\"by itself\"). Also, it was common practice to add at the end of the alphabet the \"&\" sign as the 27th letter, pronounced and. Thus, the recitation of the alphabet would end in \"X, Y, Z and per se and\". This last phrase was routinely slurred to \"ampersand\" and the term crept into common English usage by around 1837. The ampersand was indeed its own letter & was called 'and'. When any single letter could form a word it was recited, 'per se letter'. 'Per se' means 'by itself' in Latin. 'I', for instance, would have been recited as 'per se I' to denote that it was a word by itself. 'a' would have become 'per se a'. ‘And’ (&) was treated in just such a manner, it was called 'per se &', pronounced 'per se and'. The ampersand is probably ignored as an alphabetical letter due to the fact that it is a logogram and not a phonogram like the rest of the letters. It represents a word, but not a sound. Its alphabetical status is ignored; it would seem, in favor of spelling the same word with phonograms. It has remained in use, but its true status remains mostly unknown. But is this the stone the builders rejected? Liber Legis uses the ampersand, which leads us to consider whether or not, the above captioned line is actually indicating that the whole of the alphabet itself, needs to be obtained. If so, then we will also need to obtain the numeration of this letter, as it fits in the scheme of the English Qabalah. As the traditional, twenty-seventh letter, we get some interesting mathematics: Twenty-seven is 3 cubed - it is a perfect cube! 27 is also three times the sum of its digits and twenty-Seven cubed (273) = 19,683 and by adding the digits of this number (1+9+6+8+3) we get back to 27—very recursive indeed! If we understand our language as based on 27 and not 26, that brings us closer to manifesting with language because of the cubical nature of it. (this last idea is fascinating; especially in light of Liber Loagaeth...please develop this.)"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" Because of the missing '&', it seems the original sequence in Liber 805 might be wrong; should we consider this a letter of the English alphabet. Liber Al vel Legis prophesied that the order and value of the English alphabet would be ‘obtained,’ which might be said to also be directing us to either restore the alphabet or to take the whole of the original alphabet, as an act of restoration. The foundation for valuing the letters has been expounded to us by Liber 805, Liber 27, & EQ Sepher Sephiroth [put in hyperlinks]; but a single piece of the puzzle has been missed if we consider the ampersand.

Q=900 27 - number of grains in some Buddhist rosary (108 divided by 4) and is also, 27 is a ThRShRQ of 72; the Shemhamphorasch. In the preface to Liber 805, we find: I have often wondered whether or not the number seven (an important part of the Seal of the A.’.A.’.) would be sacred had we known about Uranus, Neptune and Pluto all those aeons ago. And I still sometimes wonder what would the whole scheme have been had our solar system been composed in an entirely different manner...or for that matter, how well it would hold up should humanity find itself emigrating to other planets and solar systems. This seems to provide something of an answer in Pythagoras' commentary that the number would remain sacred; no matter that \"nine and ninety-nine other planets [be] discovered.\" Together this adds to 108, which has its own significance; cf. my article: Gnostic Cycles, wherein I write: Note also that the Aeon of Aquarius will start in 2597ev when the Earth’s ‘Vernal Point’ will for the first time, be in Aquarius, 693 years after the revelation of Liber AL vel Legis! And the Sun will find alignment with the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, symbolized by the Nile in the Egyptian Gnosis in 2012ev, 108 years after the start of the Aeon of Horus. 108 of course, reduces to 9 by AIQ BKR but more interestingly is thrice 23, which is why 108 is usually the number of beads on a rosary; a hint back to the Rosicrucian truth and it is also the number of beads on the Mala that Yoga students wear. The reduction to 9 then also becomes a key to the nature of our Solar System. And as will be shown, a key to the nature of the present Manifestation, which is ruled by Sagittarius. Also 23=6 or Tiphareth or the Sun. Note the Sun (6) is 93 million miles from the Earth; another recursion of 693. The diameter of the Sun is also about 108 times the Earth's diameter and the distance between the Earth and Moon is about 108 times the Moon's diameter. Having come upon the Order & Value given here, there is much that made itself obvious, which makes it so very numinous. Particularly, its connection w/Achad’s solution is too significant to ignore. But one doubt consistently remained that was as nagging as it was incontrovertible. Liber Trigrammaton is the Order & Value prescribed and prophesied in Liber AL vel Legis. AL II.55: \"Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto.\" And Crowley writes in his commentary:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" The attribution in Liber Trigrammation is good theoretically; but no Qabalah of merit has arisen therefrom. With Motta’s appendage: (Surely it is a little early for that; a good Qabalah may take a few hundred years to unfold.) In a dialogue I had with a sincere, Thelemic Qabalist, I was shown how Liber Trigrammaton was the correct fulfillment of this verse and that Crowley was the one to “find” these “new symbols”. But per Crowley’s own admission, “no Qabalah of merit has arisen.” And so it seems something is amiss. Then a student of mine takes it upon himself to do his own research into this conundrum. Noting my use of the number 108, I am presented with the following astounding result: This is very interesting; since it ties in with my recent reflections on Liber Trigrammaton. The three cubed gives us 27, the number of verses in Liber AL required to derive the English Qabalah. It is also the number of Trigrams used in Trigrammaton. If we consider Liber Trigrammaton as a possible basis for a Thelemic Book of Hermes comprising the paths on a Thelemic tree of Life, it may be that 108 as expressed as 2 squared x three cubed expresses the archetypes of the Thelemic gnosis (Trigrammaton) multiplied and manifested through the structures of matter, i.e. 2. squared, =4 x 3 cubed = 9 portrays the squaring of the circle, due to the circular nature of nine. Also 27 is 9x3 which is 93 or 39, hence the connection between the EQ and the half of the Jews, via Hebrew Qabalah. Also 27 is the Thrasraq of 72, Shemhamphorash, the divided name of the Hebrew qabalah, also the zodiac, chokmah, thus the archetypes of the creative word.  Making the connection between the English Qabalah and Liber Trigrammaton is sublime, simple and beautiful. And note, Crowley was not to discover or find the Order & Value, but the symbols; the Order & Value was to be given to him. This was really not done. There are enough proofs in place to suggest that this gift is being offered posthumously.  Pythagoras notes that the number 3 in the cubed (i.e. 27) and number 2 in the cubed (i.e., 8) represent the Cosmos. Pythagoras of course, is responsible for the founding of the Greek Qabalah.  In the Hebrew Qabalah there are 27 letters (22 in the alphabet and 5 final forms, corresponding to 27 channels of communication with God and 27 combinations of the names of God. However only the original 22 letters make it onto the Tree-of-Life; almost begging for some adjustment to be made.  Mystical root of 27 is the number 9.  In a prime reciprocal magic square of the multiples of 1/7, the magic constant is 27.  27 contains the decimal digits 2 and 7, and is the result of adding together the integers from 2 to 7 (2+3+4+5+6+7=27)  There are 27 signs of the zodiac in Indian Astrology, while we are considering a 13th sign in Western Astrology (Ophiuchus). And in Western Astrology, the Planet Uranus (along with Saturn) rules the sign of Aquarius; the prophesied age to come (cf. Gnostic Cycles) and the planet Uranus has 27 moons. Also in 805, it is argued that 13/NOT is a key and 27 has an aliquot sum of 13 and is the first composite member of the 13-aliquot tree with the aliquot sequence (27,13,1,0). Twenty-seven is the aliquot sum of the two odd discrete semiprimes 69 (Thelema in the EQ) and 133 (Gold in the EQ). Noting that 69 (mentioned below, as one of the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"semiprimes who’s aliquote sum is 27; the other being 133, which means Gold and can here be referenced to the ‘golden path’ and suggesting Thelema as such) means Thelema in the EQ, we can consider that 69 is the number of orders and tractates in the Hebrew Mishna. Now, the Mishna was the oral tradition that ultimately led to the formation of the Talmud. Noting that 69 is also the astrological sign of Cancer (turned on its side) and that Cancer is attributed to the Chariot Atu with its connection to 418/The Great Work is an added strong point. 201=Vengeance With a Kabbalah that contains twenty-seven letters, naturally, a Tree of Life diagram must be formulated that contains twenty-seven paths on which to map them. The Book of the Law tells us, as Liber 805 demonstrates, to combine the method of the Jews with our own Hermetic system to obtain the answer. Our Tree of Life is also split into halves, as described. Both halves contain twenty-two paths for the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, but they differ slightly in their placement. The Jews more commonly use the Tree of Life arrangement of the ARI based upon the Zohar. This is like our own Hermetic Tree, but the paths leading from Malkuth both to Netzach and Hod are absent. Malkuth appears to dangle by a single path leading to Yesod. Instead of these, there are two paths crossing Da'ath from Chokmah to Geburah and from Binah to Chesed. If we combine the two arrangements, as Liber Legis commands, we have a Tree of twenty-four paths, three of which cross Da'ath into the Supernal Triad. Now, if the veil of Da'ath were ripped off and it were exposed as a true Sepirot, this would divide the three paths into six giving a total of twenty-seven! This cannot be done, it is said. “Ten and not nine! Ten and not eleven! It has been written!” Da'ath is both hidden and it is knowledge. Our new Aeon requires the knowledge to be unveiled. It is no longer hidden but manifest. It is for all. The secret is that Da'ath's number is three, the number of Binah is the feminine two, that of Chokmah is the masculine one, & Kether is zero. The numbers and letters can now be set right. Saturn can take his rightful place in Da'ath & complete the planetary hexagram that's center is the Sun. Knowledge is indeed real, but it never leads anywhere because reason is flawed. Reason only goes so far, but it can't explain what is above it, only what is below, therefore it is a veil. It's like how science and religion both fail to explain where everything comes from. You end up with ridiculous dogmas on both sides. Knowledge is silent here. It is still real, however, and a real Sephiroth. The black brothers cannot let go of the knowledge. They have gone down a dead end and can't turn around or let go. This Kent fellow is an example, he had a system that dead ended but he can't let go. He can't really defend it, so"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"he attacks! He's between a rock and a hard place. Da'ath isn't the abyss so much as letting go of Da'ath is the abyss -- because it would seem there is nothing left. It is the fool stepping off the cliff of reason into what seems like midair. He is now a fool because he has abandoned reason by abandoning knowledge. Knowledge only leads to God after it has failed. The first appetite is for food, then sex, then power, then knowledge. When all of this is exhausted, then comes the appetite for what is beyond. Anyone can be a sticking point, but especially knowledge because it would seem there is nothing beyond. Atheism! This is why the Jews do not study Kabbalah until after 40 years, because the man will have had food and sex. Sex leads to a wife and kids and the need for power and strong, but broken ego (broken like a horse, not broken like an egg) in the job and over the house. When this has failed to satisfy, he uses his power and money to gain knowledge and Kabbalah. After that, the abyss (and his religion helps to assure him there is a world beyond). Now things are different, we are much more jaded to knowledge. Women are admitted equally. Time for an improved Kabbalah understanding. Kabbalah hasn't changed, but the myths and ideas and perceptions are shifting to a clearer image. This is why these lecture magickians are so fucked up, they want the knowledge to give them the powerful character. Instead they get a warped character and dead knowledge. This has failed them, you have to get the power first, then comes the knowledge. If your ego isn't broken you cannot perceive the important knowledge correctly. If you don't have the power of your character and broken ego, the real knowledge becomes dangerous. They become dangerous to themselves. They want to run before they can walk. They want to cross the abyss before they have gotten their dicks wet. They are backwards. “All these old letters of my Book are aright...” A new Aeon demands new letters and a new Book. Our future Tarot shall have twenty-seven major arcana. Lady Harris has exalted the old Book to the height of artistry. The Beast has righted the old Tarot, & closed it. To us a new opportunity exists for a new Tarot based upon a new Law. Crowley was not like us. He was a man in between Aeons. It was for him to close the old account & begin a new one. Let us greet this opportunity as we would greet the Sun at Dawn. And let us take leave of the old and stake our fortune with the new; this can be the only result of an English Qabalah and one that belongs entirely within the Thelemic paradigm.

The Supernals themselves are the wisdom of enlightenment and the abode of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

The paths were mapped by the traditional method—in other words, 9 to 10 is the last path, 8 to 10 is the second to last, 8 to 9 is third last etc, etc, all the way up; purely mechanical order with no artistic license. Here are two things the come up as being quite important: 1) Traditional path number 27 is '&' -- ampersand!—the blasted tower, the orgasm. 2) E I O and U are all connected to Da'ath on the newly added paths (new to our system, but not new to the ARI configuration). Why? because these four paths were missing completely in our Hermetic tree and these are all vowels that would not have existed in Hebrew. \"All these old letters of my Book are aright...\" Further, the placement of Saturn on Da’ath; really, where it has traditionally been put, though the Qabalists have called this place Binah—moving the Sefira to create the hexagram is now functionally placed to include this planet in the Ruach with the others. \"There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words: these vices are my service; ye do well, & I will reward you here and hereafter.\"—AL:II.52 The modest woman is Binah and her veil is Da'ath. Saturn belongs to Da'ath making it the veil of sorrow and pall of death. Tear down the veil, as we have done declaring Da'ath a real sephiroth. It is a lying specter of the centuries, meaning the tradition regarding Da'ath has been false, as has the modesty of the woman. And for that matter, putting Uranus on Binah shows such modesty being broken up as Uranus breaks up old and non-constructive patterns. \"Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you!\"—AL:III.55 That Mary is attributed to the sea (la mer); water opposite the fire of Horus/Ra-Hoor-Khuit as the Magus noted above, we have the allusion to the Sea of Binah and so that we know it is correct to associate Mary with Binah. Further, Crowley writes in his commentary to AL:III.55 ... The name Mary is connected with Mars, Mors, etc., from the Sanskrit MR to slay and with Mare, the Sea, whose water opposes the Fire of Horus. I here quote a passage from Liber XCVII which deals with this fully. \"Let me strictly meditate this hate of the mother. M R is the Sanskrit root = \"Kill,\" hence Mara, Mors, Maria, and I suppose Meer, Mere, Mer -- in short, lots of words meaning death or sea. Note Mordred as the traitor villain in Morte d'Arthur. In Liber Legis we have \"Mary\" who is to be 'torn upon wheels' apparently because she is 'inviolate.' Liber 418 has some explanation of this: 'because she hath shut herself up', I seem to remember is the phrase. It appears (I don't remember the Sanskrit as if a dental T or D were inserted phallically to give us Madar, Mu-eta-tau-eta-rho, Mater, Mother, (? meter = measure.) "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Crowley then goes on to complain that he can’t get a satisfactory Qabalah from Mary (Myrrh), as she’s given a value of 240: “I have thought this before, long ago, but can't get a satisfactory Qabalah. 240 is a doubling of the Pentagram, of course, and is a sixfold of 40, the number of repressive 'sealed-up' law.” 240 is also the Hebrew word for ‘high/lofty,’ which would be the pretension of she who would be sealed up; though there is also the suggestion that she would then be the Shekinah. But the Shekinah is withheld if she is a ‘shut up.’ However, in the EQ, Mary equals 198, which is also the value of ‘Land of No-Thing’—Binah!!! This is her as the liberated Babalon—the goddess that the Jews and the Romans could not kill; though they tried. 198 also reduces to 18; a ThRShRQ of 81 (the Moon and hence, Yesod). And as a final note, 27, this key to the English Qabalah reduces to 9 (2 + 7)—Yesod and the word ‘nine’ is equal to 27 in our system. 2 * 7 = 14; the pieces of Osiris, reassembled by Isis (presumably after he’s crossed the Abyss and hence reconstructed in the Ruach)—so that 14 is twice the 7 planets of the Ruach—that they each have a masculine and feminine nature...a natural balance restored! Epilogue by Frater Apollonius 4º=7□ ATAT I think overall, there’s two strains that need to be followed...the original of 26 letters and the new possibilities of 27 letters and the re-design of the Tree-of-Life. It may be that we have a much stronger view of the nature of knowledge/gnosis & intelligence in the modern, post-Internet world and that the extra paths from and through Da’ath, as well as the re-numeration of the Sefirot needs to be examined. The A.’.A.’. as a living Qabalah, is built on the old way and maybe the new Tree is still ahead of our time...maybe not (you can take the pun there as well). What we do know is that we must remain open to what may be just ahead of us in the evolution of Occult Gnosis...or is it being sent by the Secret Chiefs and proscribed for now? That this ties in w/80-The Tower of Prophecy, we certainly need to do a good bit of ruminating on this. "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Collecting Notes on Liber CCXXII What follows are conversational notes during the creation of Liber 222 between the two working on the document and two others with some interest. These notes are meant to give insight into the creative qabalistic process. * I am glad you are open to new ideas, especially ones that alter established theories. I have been sitting on this and working with it for a little while just to get the wrinkles ironed out. I think my scheme and method is good, however the proof of the whole thing is in the results. I don't have results yet but with adding new words and phrases to a compendium of number sums should allow us to make a more scientific decision. At present I can't imagine it not yielding the desired results. It has been quite exciting to see several find my ideas to spark their own creativity. When Ryan came out with Liber 27 and Paul used a similar technique to examine Liber AL, things simply got richer for us all. You’ve now come along and added to this and I am exultant over this. I’m especially delighted to see that you’ve been working so hard at it...and that you’ve got an obvious Qabalistic talent. My ideas are riding on the shoulders of a lot of people. ...the big secret that the copyright obsessed don’t want anyone to find out is that all our ideas are “riding...” as you say. The only originality is the love you put into the work...that originates from you. Those that go chasing copyrights aren’t practicing love and the ‘will’ part of the formula becomes a nasty distortion. Per results: we can see an egregore already growing steady with this and brainstorm on this and help it to grow. From my initial read of your post, I can see going directly into Liber 805 and including the formula you’ve found—but I think it even more stimulating that you compose an ‘alternate’ document so that ultimately, we’ll be chasing both lines to their natural ends. I'm on it. I'll get you a tentative draft as quickly as possible. I'm going to site references strait out of the gate as prerequisites and then bust the material wide open. I would like someone to double check my work, especially the order of the letters against Liber Legis and the sums in the calculator before a lot of work is thrown in the wrong direction. I have already calculated a list of words incorrectly due to an oversight on my part. I don't want to repeat that years from now and throw an entire book of number sums in the trash & start over because of a ridiculous error or programming bug. Welcome to ‘hard work’ of Qabalah  That you obviously have the facility to be self-critical in your work; when there are so many out there that take all their initial errors and elevate them to their self-admiring ‘inspirational genius’ – well, that’s why there’s so much crap on the web in both Thelema and the spiritual community in general. They have no critical perspective. Most of this information is second hand. I have merely researched & recompiled with the exception of the new Tree of Life diagram I am proposing. All information is “second-hand” (there’s nothing new under the Sun)...just that there’s a lot of jerks out there that think they own their ‘inspirational genius.’ We always build upon what’s out there as our Gnosis continually evolves. So I don’t care about what person copyrighted whatever...just that you’ve put it together in a creative and intelligible manner. And I would be very interested in exploring your new ToL diagram. I heard about the 'initiated' scheme of Sephira from a podcast by Poke Runyon. Not exactly the kind of reference you'd site on a university thesis -- Being a Probationer, I have no idea if this is true or not. I guess it doesn't matter if it works -- success is the proof. Even the calculator was pilfered and re-wired. I don't believe in reinventing the wheel. (me neither ) I do take credit for discovering how 27 paths can be formulated with this 'initiated' scheme and the combination of the two popular diagrams -- the Jewish and Hermetic (I don't know the technical names) as Liber Legis directs. I do think that is a novel idea. Again, I’ll be eager to hear about this and the list would be a great place to discuss this. I’ll probably come at this with some initial skepticism, as these traditional paths are well-explored modes of consciousness...tried and proved over many centuries of exploration. But I always recognize that new Gnosis always butts at the foundations of the old Gnosis."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"These paths are only new on the surface. In the past we have chosen between the one diagram and the other. I’m aware of some early versions of the Tree...an interesting book on Qabalah, by Charles Ponce gives some of these; but more along the lines of the Sefirot and not the lesser paths...I’d love some material on this if you have any. There’s also something in my memory that I don’t believe I’ve retained in my archives (though I might have) where someone proposed adding some additional lines within (if I remember correctly) the Ruach...or even that it was through Da’ath as you describe below...my memory is a bit hazy here. My understanding is they are derived from the Zohar & the other from Sepher Yetzirah, the Jewish and Hermetic diagrams respectively. I am only combining the two into one. Then I take the heretical step of declaring Da'ath as a Sepiroth in its own right and dividing the 3 paths through it into six. I understand that even this reassignment of Sephira is established, but in secret. I wonder how contrived this whole pseudo-Sephiroth doctrine really is? Sounds like a blind to me. Sounds like the sort of thing Abrahamic religions do to promulgate slavery. They corrupt the knowledge and cut off half their children's dicks for the sake of appeasing a desert god. We are fallen and vile and there is a barrier between us and God? The vices of bragging & humility aside, I think our lineage will bring the English QBL that Liber Legis promised! Liber Legis said that this would not come from any expected house, I'm sure you know. Some real interesting thoughts here...I can’t wait to see your document. And I understand your point, re: Da’ath...also see it as simply a gate (sotospeak) in this one, I see PAN as the beautiful image moving downwards into manifestation, which looks quite hideous moving upwards as one attempts to flee manifestation—that not being the way of the godhead. It’s the shadow of this light that is ‘outside the thought’ of the godhead (as well described in ancient Gnostic literature: cf. my epistles on these documents: http://www.gclvx.org/?p=874) In The Red Goddess, by Peter Grey, he suggests that the Abyss is a further initiation into enlightenment and one that was given attention in modern Occultism as they ancients were only concerned with Tiphareth. I’m not all that certain about that, but it’s an interesting thought. But certainly that which is outside the thought of the godhead is the ‘nightside’ as well contemplated by Kenneth Grant (I’ve several writings on inspired by his work). And from here, we can even deduce an ‘anti-godhead’ that is much the origin of the N.O.X. and which eventually diffused into the material universe...the gross moving to the fine as the godhead is the L.V.X. seeking involution (the fine moving to the gross)...and of the whole, one great eucharist. It is the Aeon of the Child. Crowley spoke of the coming wave of children obsessed with children's games. I mentioned this to Ann and she said there was a difference between the childish and the childlike. Perhaps that is our dichotomy in this Aeon. A little more on subject, I think these lineages are satisfied to ride on the coat tails of those who may have known the Beast. Maybe Crowley's milk man should have started a lineage. A student of a student of a student... A copy of a copy. We are actually lucky to have this conversation. I almost joined your friend, Ray Eales', group. Divine intervention, perhaps. Well yes, it’s all about coattails (“I gave Crowley a blow-job and he put his spiritual essence in my mouth and I swallowed.”)..Ray would often say... “ it doesn’t matter that it’s right or wrong, it’s how Motta did it...it’s how we do it.” And he would use that to cover all sorts of inaccuracies and understandings that became apparent in his own philosophizing. So he knew Motta...well, I met Mel Stottlemeyer in my barbershop (we both had the same barber) when I was 8 years old...but I didn’t grow up to pitch for the Yankees. These sycophants are empty of spirit; exactly as Motta described when he wrote that when the Master dies, he abandons the current, which is why you don’t worship dead men...and also why you should become the master! ... after all, we are all gods!!! Of course, both Ray and Motta preach this crap that there is an ‘office of the Beast’ and that they each in turn, were/are the physical light of the Sun on Earth...as if Ray’s death without a successor would mean a day where the Sun fails to rise. Basically, like the Caliphate, they are trying to create a Papal succession...yet, they’ll run around complaining how Christist everyone else is. Likewise.

Haven’t all these so-called Thelemites read Crowley? Why do they constantly play “My daddy’s bigger than your daddy?” I think if we can do this it will prove the validity of Thelema, revolutionize occultism, and promulgate the Law. No one could deny after that. Our Law and our Book are exactly what they say they are! It will make the study of other languages for the sake of Gematria purely optional to the English speaker. I think this new Tree of Life scheme when drawn out and presented is going to be devastating! There's going to be a lot of gnashing of teeth! At this point I think it is absolutely a true scheme, and as such will be all the more despised of our brothers and sisters. Sorry if I'm going over the top, but I'm excited about the mischief implied in this. I think also that English as the new holy language; made also the international language by America’s dominance in the world heralds much for us to consider. First, English has replaced Latin (and hence, Rome as the spiritual center) and second, it’s American English with the original doctrine of the divine right of all men and the Declaration of Independence as a herald of AL. However, I don’t know about revolutionizing Occultism—more about simply getting back to the true practice, which has been lost in a plethora of glamour seekers. (Say the Magick word, win fifty bucks.) I should clarify my statement. I define occultism as an understanding of a hidden truth. I think this will revolutionize aspects of the understanding, but leave the truth as it ever is/was/will be. You will probably have to provide some direction for me in writing a formal document. I don't really know the ins and outs of such a thing. I am not very good with anything of a formal nature.

Maybe we’ll even get to meet...my sister lives in North Carolina and I am planning to visit there on xmas. The problems I see in it are: With new paths should come new major arcana.

Liber Legis claimed the tarot was right except for Tzaddi. Does this contradict? How to number, or renumber the paths? This new scheme will completely destroy the ideas about the 'fall of man' and certain ideas about Da'ath -- and the whole upper end of the Tree will be cast in a different light. The Book claims that none will be lifted up or cast down. All is as it ever was. The 'fall of man idea' will dissolve. -wait- I say that, but I know people will not be able to let go. Old habits...

I'm not a student of English QBL, but I can't believe that this is something new. Hasn't the question of the ampersand as a letter of the alphabet been raised before? yup. Don't know many words spelled with it though ;D As for 26 being 'some number' 19 to 7 is an important ratio in solunar calendars, and 26 pointed stars that produce the EQ order are pure geometry. Old School types like Pythagoras and John Dee would have appreciated that, but the average Crowleyite probationer doesn't, boo hoo. seriously, I quit as spokesman for EQ some years back. For for some reason - even though qabalah means tradition - its rare to find folks prepared to try an English gematria system they didn't invent themselves. The other approach is to ignore everything the originators said about their own system and use it for juvenile stuff instead. I'm not sure which is most presumptuous. So basically EQ is a system, you either use it or you don't, no claims for an 'only true way' were ever made by me. I just don't want to be the person fielding all the objections and examining umpteen alternative systems anymore. ALWays Jake ...some great info from Mr. Kent; his geometrical notes worth considering, as we strive to better improve our effort...and an interesting attitude from the inventor (so-called) of an EQ that has led towards a Hindu school of thought. I don't say that to denigrate his system; so much as what is Hindu stands behind much of what we call the Occult in the West. And there's an especial role for both Hindu and the Occult behind the American phenomenon. But I am I guess, also not surprised at his incredibly democratic-seeming condescension. What I mean is, by this democratic idea that everybody has to be equal in everything (a dumbass idea that's infused in European and American socio-political institutions), it's as if Mr. Kent was so sick of having to read everyone's equal approach (because of the retarded dictum: if it's good for you then it's good enough) and he'll just stick to his cool (to him) EQ--though I will agree that most of what's out there is quite worth the condescension that he exudes. But for AL to be meaningful and Thelema to be a coherent philosophical system, there must be only one solution to the order and value; it's a prophecy that may or may not be in the process of being solved by those of us whom are working on it...but we are approaching it with some credulity and with a qabalistic intelligence not displayed by most into Thelema. And despite the fact that I sincerely respect the work of JSK, it is a denomination of Thelema that is far more Eastern in its paradigm and seems only to validate the Holy Books (nore or less, really, just Liber AL as they really pay no attention to the rest of the philosophical system) for the sake of getting to its more esteemed Hindu concepts and Tantric symbols; ignoring Thelemic symbols--almost entirely. We have what Mr. Kent cannot appreciate nor could have any genuine interest in...in the elitist tone of his letter, like the tone of much of his work, he's beyond Thelema. Rather, I say, he's outside and should probably stick to his hinduized Nema-ism and Voudoun. And we'll note the misappropriated pop-particle physics with its time distortions and other elements that make fodder for untalented science fiction writers and short order cooks."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"I was hoping that he would elaborate on any research already done on the ampersand and his conclusions on whether it should be included/excluded from English QBL. I know I've spoken to him before on English QBL in general and he did have the same attitude. For whatever reason, he seems to want to distance himself from it. Perhaps, what it is today is something quite different than what he originally conceived and he's become weary of being at the center of some bastard child controversy. Perhaps more, as I really suspect, his system has become stagnant...it can no longer produce new Gnosis...it's no longer constructing the new mythos (the quest for the Grail into modern, shall we say, nomenclature)...and there's no one to renew that quest. A magickal lodge or lineage that does not produce new Gnosis is not a magickal lodge or lineage. As for 26 being 'some number' 19 to 7 is an important ratio in solunar calendars, and 26 pointed stars that produce the EQ order are pure geometry. Old School types like Pythagoras and John Dee would have appreciated that, but the average Crowleyite probationer doesn't, boo hoo. I will accept 'average Probationer'. That might even be giving me credit I don't deserve. I am certainly no John Dee or Pythagoras, but I still appreciate stars of various configurations and geometric purity levels. Maybe I was too harsh in what I said about 26. I think Mr. Kent must be who discovered the EQ with the 26 pointed star (ALWHS..)? I'm not exactly sure. I'm familiar with that system. It is very cunning and I still like how it was put together. I worked with that system for a few years on and off. It was very inspirational to me. I think Crowley set the tone for a twenty-seven based system with Liber Trigrammaton. I’m more critical of this idea that “19 to 7 is an important ration in solunar calendars”...how so?...and what solunar calendar?...I’ve never heard anything about this, and I really suspect this is something he either mis-remembers or mis-remembers on-purpose. The 26-pointed star with the magick number of 11 has never struck me as having any significance...what?...the number of letters in the alphabet mixed with the big magick number?...why?...this question was never answered. That Mr. Kent uses a geometric symbol (and a very unimportant one at that!) does not connect his ideas with Pythagoras or John Dee...maybe, had he considered a Tetractys or a more basic geometrical shape (cf. my work in the Greek Qabalah). Trying to assume sort pretense at arrogance as Mr. Kent refers to the “average Probationer” in the same thought with Pythagoras and Dee was more a manipulative statement on his part. Rather, your argument regarding Liber Trigrammaton is much more persuasive. I’m kinda saddened, but not so surprised that Mr. Kent made such a superficial statement overall...very defensive and arrogant on his part, and more an egoic projection. seriously, I quit as spokesman for EQ some years back. For for some reason - even though qabalah means tradition - its rare to find folks prepared to try an English gematria system they didn't invent themselves. The other approach is to ignore everything the originators said about their own system and use it for juvenile stuff instead. I'm not sure which is most presumptuous. I don't know how much of this is directed at me, if any, but I didn't invent anything. All I did was add something to an existing system that I thought it was missing. The system was in place, the numbering was in place, the Berashith method was already hashed out, and the scripture that calls for it's discovery has long been written. If I did anything I followed an established trail one step further. Results will prove or disprove. I've already tried two systems I didn't invent. I don't know what 'juvenile stuff' means in this context. Kabbalah can mean tradition and some other things, but the very act of creating an English Kabbalah goes against much tradition -- or maybe I should rather say there is not yet an established tradition in English gematria to go against. I think that as Mr. Kent’s system; along with his dead magick has failed to continue to inspire the fire of spirit in him. And he deep-down realizes his Hindu ends brought him to nothing more than a bunch of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Yantras. Besides, he’s more into his Goetic work today and working completely outside the Thelemic paradigm; yet, again. Per the ‘juvenile’ comment, JSK has watched a lot of people on these immature Thelema lists play with his EQ and he’s watched all their pettiness and the dumbass “juvenile stuff” that they called new Gnosis. They never acted in any cooperative manner, which for him was not to give him the adulation I think he felt he deserved for it. Nema got all the celebrity instead. What you did, Ed, to follow the tradition that has been started by those “few” of us that have been more honestly playing with it, has been a real Qabalah effort. The way the system of the Qabalah works, new Gnosis flows from the divine into any one of us (after all, we are all gods!) and then we must transmit that energy to those who are of “us.” A Qabalist doesn’t work exclusively alone; though much work is to be done alone...just being in an A.’.A.’. lineage is qabalistic work!...so many even in the A.’.A.’. that don’t understand this. So basically EQ is a system, you either use it or you don't, no claims for an 'only true way' were ever made by me. I just don't want to be the person fielding all the objections and examining umpteen alternative systems anymore. I could sympathize with that. translation: “I’m not interested in Thelema at all anymore...probably never really was...’cept that I got to hang out w/Grant and almost became a Thelema celebrity.” In JSK’s defense, I will say that his e-mail was directed to me personally, and I’m sure that if he knew we would be discussing it, he would have worded it much more diplomatically, and probably with a little more explanation. So take whatever is useful from his comments and disregard the rest. I really don't take anything personally. I think what he said speaks more about his frustrations with his system than my ideas or the gematria system that already existed in the Libri. I found it interesting that my grade of Probationer was used like an insult. I personally feel exalted to be a Probationer in this lineage that is doing important work. It's a matter of perspective. I take it as a cautionary tale about lust of result and attachment. Were he more of a gentleman I'd tell him how much his system inspired me and how much I enjoyed it -- because I really did! But he's not and I'm not going to dandle him in my arms and whisper sweet EQ correspondences in his ears to comfort him. As far as him being diplomatic to my face, no thanks -- I don't respect that kind of shit. I don't think he would have much of an explanation anyway. He says he's done with the EQ, yet he has time to crap all over anything that threatens it. His reaction proves that he doesn't care about finding the answer, yet is still too invested to let go. Indeed, if the Probationer could understand Our Order that much better, he or she would see that there’s an heroic praise and a great wisdom that can belong to the Probationer...and there’s no such thing as a “mere” Probationer...nor a “lowly” Probationer...all I can ever see in a Probationer is a brave person fighting for his or her own genius and a taste of nobility. You know, I've been noticing something. You go on these websites that Kent is on and there's a certain flavor of magickian there. Yeah, I know it's morbid and I have better things to do right now, but humor me for a second and I'll forget all about this whole thing. I followed a few links and I notice that all these people surrounding Kent have the same way of insulting everyone they can. Even their blurbs for their shitty books and lectures. They can't just say, \"this is who I am and this is what I'm about.\" No! It has to have back handed references to Crowley and Thelema in general and some stupid fantasy about how they have accomplished mastery of hoo doo and Enochian and they are some kind of Swiss Army knife of magickal potency. Note that for the most part, these authors are writing to 20+ year-old boys...that’s their principal demographic. These are boys becoming desperate for marriage and the high and holy blow-job. As the U.S. in general (even though Kent is in England, he markets to a primarily American audience) is a mostly illiterate audience (literally!...they can read labels and street signs, but that’s 99% of their reading), one has to dumb-down one’s material. This also brings ignorant forms of slander...the claim to fame being"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"that one is better than ‘that other idiot.’ And since Americans don’t read anything that requires an education, in the field of Magick and even the larger field of spirituality, only beginner books are publishable...since those few who get to the next level aren’t a large enough audience to make advanced publishing profitable. So the same books get re-written over-and-over again...year-after-year (sigh). Okay, let me just show you something. \"This work has chiefly involved the promulgation and development of 'Engllish Qaballa' as a magical system, (not a way of wearing out calculator batteries proving Crowley's claims to messiah-hood).\" Of course, “promulgation” clearly implies that ‘the word’ is being spread to an audience, which is exactly what’s not happening...most people can’t figure out the Hebrew Qabalah; much less an English hybrid of any sort. But this is very typical promotional blurb...not that much different from selling cars by showing drivers playing field hockey on the cliff of a mountain. This is a blurb about him promoting a lecture he's inflicting on a dozen goths at a renaissance fair somewhere. What the fuck is that about? LOL What about promulgating the law of Thelema? Old hat. So Thelemites are wearing out calculator batteries trying to prove claims that Crowley didn't make. Most people are too wrapped up in themselves...these authors have to be incredibly self-promoting...they’re even competing w/Crowley. Who would want to read Lon Milo Duquette or Martin Star, as they keep re-writing MITP with the Caliphate blessing?...after all, you can just get the original by Crowley. Here's someone else on the same ghastly event: \"Nathan Harris has achieved the rare distinction of becoming an 'Ex-Memebr in Extremely Bad Standing' from one of the planet's most hardcore magical orders.. Although described by some as 'Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know' [his] insights penetrate to the core of the darkside psychology of life and magic.\" Peter J. Carroll, founder of the Pact of the Illuminates of Thanateros, from his foreword to Nathan's coming book CHAOS PUNK.\" LOL Holy shit, I'm glad I ran afoul of Kent and not this dangerous, psychopathic super-sorcerer. lol...there are a lot of fads...in NYC, there’s a group of Caliphate people that think they’re so magickal because they go nightclubbing with Genesis P’Oridge...and for that matter, it’s usually some underground, kinky night club where people are tying themselves up in chains while smoking angel dust. And this sort of behavior has been going on since the mid-80s when the Caliphate won the lawsuit against Motta, which is also one of the main reasons why these lodges don’t house adults (people who’ve gotten over the pretense of going to nightclubs and actually have families with children and real jobs). Yet another one of these contacted me a couple of weeks ago...she wants to buy one of my books...but she needs to set up a lay-away. Imagine that, a $40.00 purchase needs a lay-away schedule for payment. Most of the people in Thelema are of the uneducated and unemployed cast. Okay one more and I'm finished, but I hate to do this because I actually bought this guy's book, The Complete Magician's Tables Stephen Skinner. He's reduced to lecturing on another speaking event with Kent somewhere. This is about that book from his page: \"...in more than 800 Tables, four times as many tables as Aleister, Crowley's Liber 777, or any other imitator.\" He's wrote a book that's four times better than Crowley's. Nice. Then he implies that he is an imitator. At least he's honest. Rehash, rehash, rehash...I don’t think Skinner has ever had an original thought. So all these people are going out of their way to insult and demean anyone they can, except for other hacks who appear on the same lecture events. I think I finally get it. If I make you look really ugly, people will find me to be quite beautiful. From: http://www.oocities.org/VVVVV93/ZEQ.html PJ, didn’t you know Marc Cohen/Joshua Zintel when you were working with Ray Eales in Florida?. Also, who is Frater 999? "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"VI. ENGLISH QABALAH OF 9 CHAMBERS (Please reference Table 1) You will have noticed that Da'ath - the \"invisible Sephirah\" - has thusfar been ignored. Frater 999 added the Ampersand (\"&\") to this system, as the 27th 'variable' to the 26 letter English Alphabet. He showed me a book detailing the history of the English Alphabet, which included the Ampersand with the 26 letters, giving historical validity to his inspiration: (ALPHABET: The History, Evolution, and Design of the Letters We Use Today; by Allen Haley; ISBN 0-8230-0170-9; c. 1995 e.v.) Utilizing the Ampersand as Da'ath makes sense, as Ampersand is not really a letter and Da'ath is not really a Sephirah. Indeed, even its shape (&) resembles the Great Serpent/Dragon itself. But moreover, this gives us 27 terms - the same number of versus with which it takes the Z.E.Q. to unfold the order & value, from Chapter I of Liber AL itself! Although the ampersand first appears in verse six (SIX= 718, cf. \"Abomination of Desolation\" referred to in AL), since it is not a letter proper, we reserve the right to put it at the end of the English Alphabet; as such, this 27th term will equal 900, allowing an English Qabalah of 9 Chambers. The use of a 27 (or 3 cubed) term Alphabet opens up many new possibilities, and shows the English Alphabet itself mimicking the dynamics of the interchange of 9/10 already discussed, giving us a 26/27 dynamic as well. Frater 999 has done much work with the Ampersand, and I mention his addition here chiefly to show the Qabalah of 9 Chambers that it allows. Those who feel uncomfortable with this exception to our Order & Value scheme may use 'H', which also represents Kether, being the 1st letter to appear in AL, as Da'ath - for H is also the first repeated letter in AL; or, the first duality, mimicking the first letter itself. Yet you will not have a Qabalah of 9 Chambers unless you utilize a 27th term, of which the Ampersand, which appears in The Book of the Law, is the historically most obvious choice. Thanks for this...I didn’t know that they went to the ampersand in their Z.E.Q. days. And yes, I knew both and had a big falling out w/both of them...Mark & I originally started the EQ idea w/Mark doing the original figuring on the order and value and my doing the ‘new symbols to attribute them to.’ Then we bought Joshua in and Mark and Joshua really got into both the assignment of Sephiroth and a whole range of decimal calculations. When I quit H.O.O.R., I tried to continue our collaboration, but they refused to talk to me anymore...then went around slandering me to a lot of people as a couple others in the order did four straight years of crank phone calls and threats. They then tried to accuse me of stealing their idea as I continue developing it in the direction I took it...never really liked all their decimal stuff. So I completed a lot of gematria and symbology and moved into other related aspects of the Qabalah...they came out w/Z.E.Q. and seem to have not even a remaining interest in that anymore. H.O.O.R.’s website seems to be more a mini eCommerce site than a Magickal Order...and they’ve been kissing the Caliphate’s ass in the hopes of expanding their publishing interests. Damn, that's crazy. They figured it out, but why did they place the & at the end and not where it would fall in the Berashith method? That is an interesting question...it seems to me it should be in the order in which it appears, as per the other letters...or it is not a letter. This also goes to the problem I’ve seen with trying to attribute the letters to the Sefirot...there’s a reason why the letters aren’t a part of the Sefirot in the Hebrew QBL, why should it be any different w/the EQ. And if the EQ isn’t directly related to AL and/or the other Holy Books of Thelema, then how can it be a Qabalah?...What is the Hebrew QBL w/o the Torah? And it seems only natural that the next holy book of importance would be the next manuscript that comes closest to a Class A transmission...and that can only be Liber 418; a Class A-B document. The rest of the holy books are no higher than Class B. And here, we must look to Babalon and the Beast—the Goddess and her consort as the mythological characters in our epic mythos. And we must find in the Biblical references in AL (such as ‘abomination of desolation’) the proper connectors that show the evolution of an historical journey that connects the past w/the present and the future. These two got to a certain point and couldn’t go any further; though they had some moments of genius. I really believe that Marc and Joshua fell to their vanity when they decided to launch their highly energetic and sick campaign against me. They were obsessed w/me for years."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"I figured out why they deviated from the Berashith method and why it's faulty. It's faulty because Crowley spelled 'and' in I:3. He uses '&' in I:6. If the '&' should go at the end he would have continued to spell 'and' until after I:27. He doesn't. The reason why they are putting it at the end is because they do not believe it is a real letter due to its logogramic state. It is the closest thing we have to a hieroglyph and is the odd man out, but it's a letter all the same. Yes, I believe the issue really is; either it’s a letter or it isn’t...no matter the type of letter. This is the important decision and one that can’t be ignored or avoided, which is what I thought immediately, when I got your first email. That it is no longer considered a letter today also has its import. So it seemed then as it does now, that we let both lines run until we can see which answer plays out...or maybe even that both may be correct, which would be even more amazing. Though I gotta say, I like the idea of the ampersand a whole lot. It seems to have much to do with the direction to ‘change not so much as the style of a letter.’ Da'ath is also real. It represents knowledge; and because knowledge has, traditionally, been hidden, the sephiroth has been hidden also. I think that in this Aen knowledge can't be easily hidden. Every day knowledge is harder and harder to hide. Secrets are coming out and our private information is also harder to hide. Da'ath, also can no longer be hidden. I think this is of paramount importance and very perceptive of you to say this! Yes, I remember once, Marc and Joshua berating me because I touted knowledge; they were tying Da’ath in with Choronzon as evil and of the Black Lodge. I remember telling them they were idiots...knowledge is necessary to figure out how to tie your shoes...where would we draw the ‘evil’ line. At what point does one get to so much knowledge that he becomes evil. They were such jerks. If you want to see more of this style of thinking from Ray Eales—Mottants, read my ‘Defender of Eales’ article...David Stein does a whole other number; trying to make me look like a piece of shit for quitting Ray. They were all a part of a salacious cult that continues to this day. The reality of both of these things lies at the heart of the gematria and ToL I propose, but neither of these ideas has been accepted in the source page. They almost have it, but not quite. I want you to look at my Tree of Life diagram. I mapped the letters backwards the first time and was not impressed. I was trying to figure out whether it was any good and what might be the significance. When I realized my mistake I remapped them without much thought. When I got to looking at what I had I almost freaked. First a word, I did not manipulate this at all. I used the Berashith order and value that we established with the '&' included. I numbered the Sephira from 0 to 10 and included Da'ath, like I said. I combined the Jewish ARI and Christian Hermetic diagrams like I talked about. I mapped the paths by the traditional method -- in other words, 9 to 10 is the last path, 8 to 10 is the second to last, 8 to 9 is third last etc, etc, all the way up. Purely mechanical order with no artistic license. Here are two things I have noticed about it that I think are important: 1) Traditional path number 27 is '&' -- ampersand! LOL The blasted tower, the orgasm. 2) E I O and U are all connected to Da'ath on the newly added paths (new to our system, but not new to the ARI configuration). Why? because these four paths were missing completely in our Hermetic tree and these are all vowels that would not have existed in Hebrew. \"All these old letters of my Book are aright...\" I'm not going to comment any further -- I attached the file. I think this is brilliant...I had met someone some time back who added the same paths to the tree...but couldn’t convince me of anything as they were still working off the Hebrew for the paths...or maybe it was JSK’s EQ solution...I can’t remember for certain. With this, I not only like it, I think it all belongs back on the original document we were setting up...I’m going to prepare a draft copy for you to look at...you should have it shortly. An interesting note to add into this document... Noting that 69 (mentioned below, as one of the semiprimes who’s aliquote sum is 27; the other being 133, which means Gold and can here be referenced to the ‘golden path’ and suggesting Thelema as such) means Thelema in the EQ, we can consider that 69 is the number of orders and tractates in the Hebrew Mishna. Now, the Mishna was the oral tradition that ultimately led to the formation of the Talmud. Noting that 69 is also the astrological sign of Cancer (turned on its side) and that Cancer is attributed to the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Chariot Atu with its connection to 418/The Great Work is an added strong point. ...also, 27 is a ThRShRQ of 72; the Shemhamphorasch. Excellent. I'm glad you understand. It is hard to communicate something like this. It makes you feel alone. I want to propose a change in plan. As far as I'm concerned I have said what I want to say with the graphic. I have said more than I ever wanted to say! Use my original or have it duplicated in a better, cleaner version -- as you see fit. Add my Motto to a cover page and a title. Add a commentary of your own and sign it with your motto. You are far superior in your knowledge. I could only hinder people with my attempts at explanation. I don't even understand half of the ideas you have given me and probably won't for years. You have made this possible and I have been in the weird position to be able to see it. My mind is simple. I think about simple things. Besides, I would be honored. I think I want to title it Liber Revenge! Calculate it. The ampersand is a sideways view of the crown of Osiris. Osiris was cut into 14 pieces by Set. Set is the force of the black brothers. Osiris was destroyed by him just as Christianity was destroyed by Paul and Catholicism. Isis goes out to find the pieces and revive him with her magick, but returns with only 13. The 14th is his foreskin. In memory of this loss they placed the image of the foreskin on Osiris' head as a crown. Now that the practice of circumcision is winding down (as are the dumbass religions), the ampersand, the sign of physical love has returned to it's place (the Tower). We are Horus, we are taking revenge on these Setian cretins. Isis whored herself to Set to produce a child who would destroy him. The Hermetic knowledge mated with the Christist idiots of the Western tradition and finally children were born of a different stripe who would kill the influence of Set. Crowley and Nietzsche and were among the first and brightest. Liber Revenge! Mind blowing stuff, has anyone begun doing math with this revised system as of yet? It will be interesting to compare the quality of synchronicities with the system from Liber 805. The whole thing supports my main thesis in Liber 27, that the trigrams have a direct correspondence with the English alphabet in so far as forming an English Qabalah, and my previous observations connecting 27 and 108 as you quoted earlier. As you read the dialogue in the emails, you’ll see that Jake Stratton-Kent (creator of that other EQ) played with a real flimsy criticism of our EQ idea and then condescended to call Ed a “mere Probationer.” This also evoked much in the origin of 805 as connected to Marc and Joshua; my original partners in this enterprise and who then went on to develop what they called the Z.E.Q. (Z was the initial of Marc’s motto at the time—Zarathustra). Revenge = 222 in EQ; 222 is of course, Chokmah ... and the letters of Chokmah also equals 222 in EQ! 27 = NO in EQ!!! (cf. Not) ... it’s also the number of verses in AL that it takes for all the letters to appear! ... and also, the word ‘hidden,’ which seems a reference to the riddles of AL—all these things being hidden for us to find. Yet a curious thing about the number 26 is its connection to the middle pillar and the shushuma, since there are 26 vertebrae in the human spine. Of course the Crown would make the 27th! All this has been discussed in my little book on EQ titled 'Liber 27'. I'm curious to use the new system to see what it gives us regarding our magickal formula such as Babalon Chaos etc... I think overall, there’s two strains that need to be followed...the original of 26 letters and the new possibilities of 27 letters and the re-design of the Tree...shown now, on the link I sent to the list. It may be that we have a much stronger view of the nature of knowledge/gnosis & intelligence in the modern, post-Internet world and that the extra paths from and through Da’ath, as well as the re-numeration of the Sefirot needs to be examined. The A.’.A.’. as a living Qabalah, is built on the old way and maybe the new Tree is still ahead of our time...maybe not (you can take the pun there as well...lol). What we do know is that we must remain open to what may be just ahead of us in the evolution of Occult Gnosis...or is it being"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"sent by the Secret Chiefs and proscribed for now? That this ties in w/80-The Tower of Prophecy, we certainly need to do a good bit of ruminating on this. You have done well in writing the comment and I am glad I left this to you. You have spearheaded this whole thing for so long. When I first wrote you I feared sounding presumptuous speaking to the Order Head at the grade of 0=0 about such a thing. Now I feel presumptuous in claiming this thing to be mine, even in part. The Book of the Law would not have predicted it were it my invention. I think that a lot of shit is going to get thrown in the monkey cage at the zoo soon. I am not going to defend what we have done in any way. 222 will stand on its own. I think that a lot of people will crush themselves against this monument. PS 2x7=14, the pieces of Osiris 2+7 is “nine,” which equals 27 in EQ. It keeps getting deeper. I have found justification for my Da'ath theory 52. There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words: these vices are my service; ye do well, & I will reward you here and hereafter. The modest woman is Binah. Her veil is Da'ath. Saturn belongs to Da'ath making it the veil of sorrow and pall of death. Tear down the veil, as we have done declaring Da'ath a real sephiroth. It is a lying specter of the centuries, meaning the tradition regarding Da'ath has been false. I think it's interesting that I said something about this and you find at least two or three more things to tie into that. I wasn't aware of half of the things that are now in the document. A slight criticism: It seems that the document is all preface and introduction -- which I think are both great. The image is present, but I think the reader might eventually ask, \"What is the Liber itself?\" not realizing. I suppose that is fine, leaving them hanging, looking for something that is right in front of their face, like what we were doing looking for the alphabet. Perhaps it is best that way, re-thinking it. I really think that last thing about Mary torn on wheels really elevates the perception of the verse from the black metal angst of the teenager, to an actual and useful commentary upon Kabbalistic theory of the highest order. Actually, I’m a bit surprised that you say the move from Introduction to the document is unclear...there’s two clear sections to the main document: 222/Chokmah and 201=Vengeance...four sections in all; Preface, Introduction, 222, 201 & Epilogue. Every writing effort is a learning experience...I think I can also echo your statement...I wasn’t aware of half the things that are now in the document. ;-) The technical approach to Qabalah is as important as other methods, approaches and practices. And the march to Knowledge is vital; something I’ve known for a long time, as I’ve always known that Raja-Yoga is one of the approaches to enlightenment. That the new paths on the tree elucidate this is quite important. Next time we talk, ask me about this and Rosicrucian vision...as a matter of fact, I’ll call you in a few...I have a little time before I have to run out. You know, these video games that everyone is obsessed with. I'll tell you what good comes out of them. They get people used to the idea of controlling a person who is not actually them. It is like they incarnate in the alternate lower world. It's them but it isn't them. Using the reverse of this reasoning, you can more easily comprehend and accept that maybe the physical body is like this with a greater being or consciousness controlling us in this physical realm. Incarnation is a game like that in a way. It gets the masses more ready to accept a Hermetic idea about life. What I don’t like about this is both the obvious allusion to PKD and the nihilist philosophical position that there’s a better world than this one; somewhere else and not in this life. I'm glad you don't mince words. Not sure what PKD is and my idea on nihilism is different than looking for a world beyond. I thought nihilism is more to do with there not being anything beyond. Perhaps I was"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"stretching this 'video' idea. I do, however, think there is a more permanent and powerful aspect of myself, and everyone else, not apparent in the physical incarnation. I agree with you that there is “some more power aspect” of the self; the Autoeides or Holy Guardian Angel...and PKD (Phillip K. Dick) was a cool author (B5 being my favorite Sci-Fi of all time), but his Gnosticism was about hating this world. People who get stuck in thinking the body is all there is aren't going to cross they abyss of death for fear. They are going to turn into black brothers and cling to the precipice of Da'ath. Cling to everything and build a snail's shell to protect them. Dissolution is all. Though I think yes, there’s still the idea of an over-identification with the physical body, that obviously must undergo change and die. However, the body as it is in this moment, interacts with spirit and is the vessel that hold joy. And as much as the body presents its own situation relative to soul and spirit...so the congealed soul must also ultimately be abandoned to move even deeper. The Universe emerges outwards from the godhead within. It is a strange riddle that we should cross the veil of death and not physically die. Were this the case there could be no incarnate Magister Templi. How can one claim to have crossed it and live? I’d like to be able to say that I’ll let you know when it happens....lol. IAO is all vowels and no consonants. He is all force and no modulation! The movement of the mouth in this pronunciation is opening - opening - opening, then closing and waning back to nothing. It is like a wave growing and receding. The power is there. Consonants modulate and direct the force. They make sense of the expression. Reason is flawed. Above reason is pure force, perhaps. Force looking for expression. IAO reformed to OIA produces a path from Chesed to Kether through Da'ath and Binah. I'm not sure if this is significant. Certainly it is...IAO/OAI is the nature of the movement of the involutionary and evolutionary processes—but they belong to another Qabalah. If you are looking for holy names in the EQ, you’d have to look to the EQ or find truly amazing synchronicities. I agree and that's a good point. The problem is there are few English holy names. Even Liber Al uses Egyptian names. Perhaps Liber Al is setting the precedent to absorb the Egyptian pantheon. I used IAO because of its connection with the Star Ruby. IAO is the Gnostic name for God...much on this in my work on the Greek Qabalah. What do you think about this 27 club? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club I came across this when I was doing some research off the original links you sent me...not too impressed by this. Nor am I, but the thing seems to be outside the realm of pure chance. Not really, for every young star that died at 27, I can show you 26, 22, 33, etc. This is the usual propagandistic exclusion of some facts to enhance others. It would seem to me that Da'ath is no longer a hurdle to be leaped across. The old magickians were trying to leap from 4 to 3, crossing Da'ath. Now we have a Kabbalah that says that Da'ath is 3! and is death and hate and a flawed knowledge. The knowledge is great below Da'ath but is blind above. Perhaps it is so frightening because this is the point where everything you worked for disintegrates. How do we"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"contemplate without knowledge? The sound of one hand clapping, perhaps. What guides us then? Pure delight -- joy? I think there is a certain weariness at the ends of knowledge that produces a natural nihilism and moral decadence. One chooses to avoid a certain, maturing discomfort with a myopic vision that brings an over-concern for one’s immediate comfort, which is the maintenance of the congealed soul and vital ego. So I don’t know that it’s a leap nor that it has ever been a leap at that point. Moreover, it’s really the point at which one traverses the path from Chokmah to Kether (where the Fool Atu is placed) that has been traditionally where this leap has been said to be; moving to the mystery of Kether: Not self is self. \"Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you! \" The inclusion of the word 'wheels' is the key that confirms we are talking about Sephirah! You have done well to perceive this verse in connection with the verse I spoke about: \"There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words: these vices are my service; ye do well, & I will reward you here and hereafter. \" I think these verses speak also about nuns and the burka and Victorian swimwear and modesty in the name of holiness. This is a mundane interpretation of the veil of Da'ath, but if all women are chaste and modest, they deny themselves and men the experience. Is Nuit saying that she is Binah, but not correctly perceived? This other verse speaks further: I think Nuit is as Reguli asserts; the daughter of Babalon, who is herself, the desire of the godhead to know itself. Babalon then births the field of play in which the godhead will act as a woman provides the garden in which you wills sew your seed. And every sexual act is procreative; that people should know what phantasmagoric things they are creating so much of the time. It’s almost a wonder that we continue to evolve as a race. However, when the chaste woman acts, she is manipulative as a witch and acts with volition but without love. In other words, her legs may be open, but her heart shut. Any child born of this union is an abomination—without divine presence...and the psychopaths and narcissists become more and more prevalent in our society. It could be argued that she is the one manipulated. Manipulated to believe she is a filthy creature who should not express sexuality except to hook a husband or manipulate men. A woman's real sexuality must remain in secret. I certainly don't view women as innocent victims. When i was a child I, too, was manipulated with a sin and guilt complex. When I emerged from this programming I realized how much I had lost my life to an idea that was false. I had wasted so much of my time in the name of a God who never was. It was both liberating and a slap in the face. In order to leave that mentality you have to admit you had been played for a fool. Women are, I think, more prone to social manipulation, especially when it comes to sexuality. The words whore and slut don't apply to men very well -- we are players or lady's men. It's a lot more complementary. This incomplete view of the self is promulgated by veiling the vices in virtuous words. You are right to say that our world is filled with incomplete people -- monsters. All these social problems in a Christist culture are one thing...but my point was that Babalon is of the nature of the godhead itself...and not merely some archetypal slut. That we attach the words, whore and harlot to her is more a symbolic expression that is more complicated than the oversimplified sexual mores of the Christists. I recommend you check my articles out on Babalon and the Beast. As well, Cammy on our eGroup will be turning out something interesting in the near future. \"I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness.

Innocence is wonderful when you're holding a kitten or a baby -- it is like godhood in their eyes. It's pathetic in a fifty year old lecture magickian and advanced teenager ---\"all fools despise!\" Yes, these “professional soldiers” that never really put skin in the game. Such are men like DuQuette and all the Caliphate that have appeared over the last few decades...and the A.’.A.’. lineages that find round-a-bout ways to get money from their students...and the creative ones that hold back their prophecy and experience until coin is rendered...all shut ups (cf. Book of Lies, cap. 89 and our Liber 89). You are correct. They want to play. Magick is a Disney resort to these people. You go there on the weekend or when your OTO buddies are over. I never thought about this in terms of magickians as the soldiers. There is plenty of literature that describes the mystic as warrior...Star Wars being a modernized example and Castaneda, another. And as we spoke on the phone, we are taught in this literature that we have only one true enemy, ourselves. That the Caliphate has made a game of this for their young membership to be exploited is all about money and publishing power...they’ve traded spirituality for this...these perfect nihilists and narcissists. But then why should anyone be surprised...they didn’t look to the A.’.A.’. for spiritual authority, but rather, mocked Our Order and betrayed Our secrets, as they looked to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for their authority...secular, governmental authority. And in recent years, they again want to pretend they are A.’.A.’.????!!!! Sometimes, sometimes they are the many different emotions involved in love-making as Grant has well detailed...sometimes they are the nature of one’s working morale. I had never thought about strange drugs in connection with the emotions and the natural chemicals produced by the body. This is interesting. I don't know why I hadn't seen this before. Grant writes about the 28 different lubricants in the vagina for the 28 days in her cycle...I found this fascinating when I first encountered it myself. I have your mailer all prepared and should get it in the mail to you tomorrow. A lifetime of experience in a single night. I said before that they want to cross the abyss before they have fucked. The want to die before they have lived. Luna is the small death, sex. They want the big death, Saturn, before the little death. What is the whole point of anything if not experience? The Christist egregore is one of pain...the Buddhist assertion that desire (Babalon) is the source of sorrow and hence, life itself is sorrow. And so why continue through to experience in this paradigm? Only if life is pure joy is such a goal as experience worth the effort. Desire is the source of pain because lust of results ruins the act of obtaining desire. They want to shoot their wad as fast as possible and get to heaven with Jesus and Grandma. This is why 'born again' is so popular. This lie tells them to say a magic prayer and they can avoid having to change their behavior and shoot straight to Jesus at death. Chaos can't intrude upon a sure thing like that. The game does not have to be played in Christianity or Buddhism. Their game is avoiding the real game? This is lust of result taken to it's natural conclusion. It's like the DuQuette ritual video. He wants to shoot straight to the conclusion and skip the ritual. The point of the ritual is the ritual. He wants to evoke 72 demons in 72 hours. I think it would be better to evoke a single demon correctly in 72 years. I have a new idea for the Tower. I can envision an eastern style tower like those of the Taj. Instead of the traumatic circumcision, it should be displayed as a symbol of power! It should no longer be blasted or shown with the mouth. I think the mouth is when the Rabbi sucks the bloody penis. What is going on"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"with that anyhow? It should be restored to a tower of Babalon that succeeds in reaching heaven, not a blasted tower that fails. Eternal joy, not limited orgasm. Confusion of our language is at an end with Liber 222. The symbol of the mouth is very important as the Tower is the mark of prophecy. And don’t forget the curse of the Magus (Grade of Chokmah 222); his truth being found as lies. Liber 222 is but the continuation of a journey started w/805 and moving through 27. 222 is excellent work, but closer to the beginning of yet, a much longer journey. It is very clear to me now. The tower is not only the penis but the destroyed libraries of Alexandria and of John Dee and of book and record burnings and the murder of those who know too much. These may not have been physical towers, but were intellectual towers. Yes! A part of the work of the Philosophus is through knowledge, to connect the past with the present as one begins to learn to take control of one’s destiny. It is the tower of Babel (Babalon -- \" the desire of the godhead to know itself.\"). It penetrates the night sky of Nuit. It is eternally growing in stature with each year. If a mouth is present in the image it is the mouth that makes the penis erect. It is no longer the fire breathing destroyer of the Book of Thoth. It is the circumcision of the tongue and not of the penis. It speaks clearly and unites the languages. It is educated speech. It is the education of the Trivium: grammar, logic and rhetoric. This is also what has been lost: the foreskin and the education. This is why the foreskin was on the head of Osiris. He lost part of his penis and part of his mind. So the tower represents consciousness comprehending itself...discovering truth...speaking prophetic words. Yes. I am beginning to think it may be the Tree and Kabbalah itself. Language is confounded, this was the 'steps' leading upwards -- letters. Jacob’s ladder is a great qabalistic story. The blind God wants to destroy the tower and send us scattered in ignorance, but we are stronger. It is us who will strike in this Aeon. Instead of the blasted tower, perhaps it is the tower that blasts against the forces of darkness. It is still the orgasm, but on the terms of Love and not hate. The orgasm freed from lust of results. The black brothers fuck to reproduce themselves and continue their hateful breed. For us it is joy. It is experience. It is a tower of knowledge that contains the force that might one day penetrate past knowledge -- past itself -- into the Triad where reason fails. Instead of God destroying us with the thunder of fear, we destroy this false God with the sword of education. This sword is the proud and learned tongue. I have said that the lecture magickians, cultists, and caliphate will crush themselves against the monument of 222. This is a vision of that obelisk inside the Tarot. It is the \"Knowledge & Delight\" unified of Liber Al. Our light will always burn in the darkness...but we are the few and will continue to be such for a long time. The world is still a place of ignorance and dark minds; closer to the N.O.X. as we are children of the L.V.X. The is the proverbial Black School of Magick that we distinguish ourselves from...different from the Black Lodge, yet both feed on human ignorance. The monument is the righted QBL of Liber Al. 222, 805, 27 are the keys. That is more clear to me now. It is Kabbalah itself. They will not crush themselves against 222 (I was too concentrated on 222), although they will slander it and throw tantrums. It is the revelations of Liber Al that will destroy. Al is the prophecy of the mouth -- the tower is an aspect of it's Truth (Kabbalah). English QBL is the sorting out of the language that was confounded."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" English has not been confounded in any way; it has evolved like any other language. Don’t get hung up on the Tower of Babel story...it’s a slave story of God’s vengeance against those who would declare the divinity of man. Well, here we are again, building out tower...because the slave god’s an asshole. I don't mean to say that English was confounded in the myth (or that this was an actual event) but language itself was confounded through some sort of mechanism. Even were this story literally true, I realize English would not have been generated in that age. I am laboring under the idea that English will be the modern universal language, just as Latin was, and this mythical once-unified language of the Bible. I reference this story because I think we are in a similar place today, building a tower to reach the heaven of the Supernal Triad. The reason I like these stories is because of what is implied. Even when I was a child and this was inflicted on me I realized there would be no smiting of the tower were a real threat not implied. The whole book of Genesis is a story of the desert God retreating from the power of man. The garden of Eden's main plot device was God ass-covering and the prevention of man's usage of the Tree of Life -- half the battle had already been lost under the Serpent's influence while God was out 'getting his hair did'. In the time of Enoch, it was said that he walked with God. What this means is that in our pre-Cambrian state, we ‘thought’ with a different mind; that mind that today we call the cerebellum—the part of the brain that dreams and also handles our instinctual awareness. This is a pre-language (sotospeak) mind of symbols and basic urges. Eventually, that language was ‘confounded’ as we moved our consciousness to the cerebrum and the front of our brain structure. And here, the old symbolism became more a memory—when the dreaming began and trance & prayer became necessary to ‘walk with God.’..and also, language began. Has English not been confounded? I think perhaps it has if you look at the modern speech and the lack of knowledge about the ampersand. The Trivium was once the language art, now it's a metal band. A futuristic take on this theme is expressed wonderfully in the movie 'Idiocracy'. But of course, there are yet several letters to consider that also are no longer in the language. One I found immediately in the research that was connected with the ‘th’ sound and the letter ‘y’ (giving us ‘ye olde store’); another combines the ae into one letter. You have had an amazing qabalistic experience and one where I suspect the Secret Chiefs spoke through you. But no truth is absolute as is no one person. Keep the ‘Aha!’ as a L.V.X. within and let it transform every cell in your body.

Sometimes, there are really funny synchronicities and I don’t pretend to understand that I have any idea of how the term ‘bling-bling’ came to be. But it is interesting to me see that though ‘blinger’ is an act of discriminating...that part of such behavior would be to wear something that separates one from others. The wearing of bling-bling says to others, “I’m rich and you’re not” – as much as it says: “I’m black and you’re not.” And so I don’t see that the apple has really fallen that far from the tree. To make matters worse the improper bigotry definition (2) appears ahead of the real meaning of the word (3 & 4). This confusion is not present in the older Webster's Dictionary I inherited from my grandparents. I think that a confounding of language is simply a tactic of some sort of ignorance force that is still very much in play. The destruction of knowledge is a recurring theme. I understand where you're coming from, but I have to disagree on this point. It can be a tactic of an ignorant force of language in much the same way that ebonics was once trying to establish itself. But it can also be the sign of a living language that takes in new words and goes through the inevitable process of change (in contrast with dead languages like Latin).

The worship is about the Tower because the magickian stands on the path of the Tower (#27) and invokes the Sephira in his body during Star Ruby. I especially like this now; considering the qabalistic story you told me of the 23rd letter and Adam’s ability to create. Especially the cubical nature of 27. I'll have to do some more research about the 23rd letter. I was in the chaos days when I read this, so I saw it as a curiosity only. I need to track this down again. The Tower is the magickian. No, the Tower Atu is a glyph of the process of creation; for Crowley and in Thoth, that meant that there was the tearing down of the old Aeon and into the new one. But this must evolve to the establishment of those kind of humans ... whatever root-race (in a Blavatskian sense) that are manifesting on the Earth at this time in the continuation of the Platonic Wheel. I think I'm on to something here. House of God - Temple of God? Yes, I think we have a way of looking at the Tower Atu as the creative conductor that channels the Logos into manifestation. As the mouth, it speaks prophecy; that is the words of manifestation and dharma...not prediction of the future, but manifestation of the present and the infinity that that holds for us. When I was first learning the Tarot; back in the late 70s/early 80s ev, I lived near the George Washington Bridge (at the top of Manhattan) in NJ. There was an African clan leader teaching the cards at the Magickal Childe (a famous shop you may have heard about) and who lived in the apartment complex over the bridge Port Authority. I had a profound experience with my first serious study of the cards...with the Hierophant Atu (from which the letter ‘H’ became an important letter—as shown in several of my writings)...the card told me that in using the Tarot, I was “invoking” and went on to describe invoking as a process of manifesting what I visualize. In the letter ‘H,’ I’ve visualized holiness and the profundity that accompanies it and my magickal career began, as a natural evolution of all that I had studied in spirituality since my childhood. It was the most profound vision I had had for quite a few years to come; until an important Neophyte vision—another story for another time. The Holier place in the Tower is ‘on fire’—the fierce fire of spirit that in its material expression rages with a vengeance. And note well that Liber AL, though very symbolic and with great spiritual import, is also a manual on material existence and here the fire burns literally in war and with that old curse: ‘may you live in interesting times.’ The Tower is the alchemical furnace (cf. Art Atu) and it is the ‘burning bush’ at the top of a mountain; a very particular human archetype—the holiness of the Tarot being that it presents a collection of images from that pre-Cambrian state when the gods dwelt amongst us and we could speak their language. I strongly recommend that you read Julian Jaynes: The Origins of Consciousness in the breakdown of the Bi-cameral Mind. And then acquaint yourself with the workings of the Merkabah tradition. You will come much closer to the deeper importance of Thelema and its ancient Gnostic heritage. The Kabbalah is invoked in him during the Kabbalistic cross. The Khabs (Kabbalah) is in the Khu.

AL:I.36 “My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khu-it.” AL:III.3 \"Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them.\" Liber Al is going to cull the weak from the strong. The revelations we are discovering will be the vehicle for that. Liber Al will be exposed, just as Da'ath is exposed, just as magickians will be exposed -- Christists of all stripes. What hides beneath those robes? The exposure will flatter some and humiliate others. I was hasty in what I wrote last night because I felt like I had to get it down or loose it. I don't pretend that Liber Al and 805, 27 or 222 will make Oprah's book club anytime soon, but things will change. We will probably be ignored for as long as possible. Denial. Let those who have ears... Let those who have eyes... AL:I.60 \"My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us. The Five Pointed Star, with a Circle in the Middle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black to the blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.\"  "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"I think these verses attack the same problems from the mundane as well as intellectual, Kabbalistic level. Note the 'Knowledge & Delight' phrase! Knowledge and delight should be tied together. Further confirmation that perhaps Da'ath is death to the ignorant, but bliss and delight through experience -- delight is the way forwards, both in sex and death. Knowledge is made true through experience? Without that experience knowledge is \"that lying spectre\". It is a farce and the hate of the lecture magickians and cultists for those among us who are relevant. Hate is their curse. They are diametrically opposed to the Book of the Law which proclaims love. They are ghosts, corpses that walk. The life energy has left them. They are liars! 19 to 7 ratio indeed! John Dee and Pythagoras were not among these sissies! Fuck them! Well said! Every move that we make with this will be a threat to them. Liber 222 will be vengeance and revenge! It is no wonder Liber Al was written as it was -- full of blood and fire. \"Ah! Ah! Death! Death! thou shalt long for death. Death is forbidden, o man, unto thee.\" Is this not saying then, thou shalt long for knowledge of Gnosis, which is then forbidden...in other words, all can’t be known and one can’t know all...as in Liber LXV when the swan asks: “But why sleekest thou the knowledge of their equivalence?” But yes, every step we take into Gnosis threatens the sleepers. Saturn again. The mystery of Da'ath is forbidden by Sepher Yetzirah 1:4 \"Ten and not nine, ten and not eleven etc.\" We, as magickians, long to cross the abyss and become Ipsissimus. Knowledge has always been linked with sex and death. To KNOW a woman, as the Bible would say. The Tree of Knowledge brought death to the man and woman in Genesis -- not really, but eventually they died. LOL Demiurgos didn't say instant death! Still, it was forbidden. And as the Gnostic gospels state, those with Gnosis shall not taste death. Now I feel very uncomfortable that I shared the JSK e-mail. As I said to Ed earlier, take what is useful out of his criticism and discard the rest. This talk of revenge is counterproductive – it brings in a completely unnecessary negative vibe to the whole project. I think in some of the follow-up conversations that have been held between just Ed and I, and what you actually find in the document itself is that the place of ‘vengeance’ is that ‘holier place’ that RHK, the ‘lord of vengeance’ goes to, which is then found to be the supernals and the abode of the truly righteous; the Gnostic Saints. AL III.3: \"Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them.\" From the New Comment: (The God of Vengeance is in Greek Omicron Alpha-Lambda-Alpha-Sigma-Tau-Omega-Rho, Aleister. For some reason which I have not been able to trace, this God became ALASTOR, the Desert Daemon of the Rabbins, the later the \"Spirit of Solitude\" of Shelly. The attribution is appropriate enough, the root being apparently A AOMAI, I wander. The idea of \"Going\" is dreadful to the bourgeois, so that a wanderer is \"accursed'. But, me judice, to settle down in life is to abandon the heroic attitude; it is to acquiesce in the stagnation of the brain. I do not want to be comfortable, or even to prolong life; I prefer to move constantly from galaxy to galaxy, from one incarnation to another. Such is my intimate individual Will. It seems as thou this \"god of War and of Vengeance\" is then merely one who shall cause men to do their won Wills by Going as Gods do, instead of trying to check the irresistible course of Nature.) AL III.47: \"This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it.\" From the Old Comment: These mysteries are inscrutable to me, as stated in the text. I note that the letters of the Book are the letters of the Book of Enoch; and are stars, or totems of stars. (See 15th Aire in Liber 418). From the New Comment: \"one cometh after him:\" 'one,' i.e. Achad. See Appendix{Appendix not yet recovered} for this and other points of this most 'evidential' verse. \"the Key of it all:\" all, i.e. AL 31 the Key! See MS for allusion to the \"line drawn\" and the \"circle squared in its failure.\" The attribution (in the Old Comment) of the letters to those of the Book of Enoch is unsupported. From Motta’s Comment: The injunction that AL be always translated along with a facsimile of the original is important, since no translation, no matter how good, can maintain all the keys, subtle double-meanings, and qabalistic puns of the original. If a student hopes to accomplish much, he will be forced to learn the English language very thoroughly. This suggests that English may in future centuries achieve the distinction of a hieratic language. AL III.48: \"Now this mystery of the letters is done, and I want to go on to the holier place.\" ...and again, this ‘holier place’ being the Supernals; or even the firmament of stars. So we might enjoin the idea that Crowley made a mistake when he rescinded the connection with the Starry Gnosis in writing his New Comment. No, no – I am objecting to the vitriol in the e-mails. You’re trying to use intellect to explain your emotional reactions to both JSK and Marc/Joshua. I think there was some vitriol for Ed...for me, it was more a memory as a synchronicity. My personal vengeance re: Eales & Co., is my success...and I have carefully lulled Ed away from his eGroup attitude. Personally, I do not need to triumph over JSK either...but I am competitive (typical male: at least here) and do think that I am championing something more profound than JSK has produced. But that’s really neither here nor there...sotospeak. And Ed has naturally joined onto the competitive, male notion. And Ed is still championing himself against the external enemy...he will eventually find the real enemy is within. Ah....Probationers. It’s funny but I actually felt a physical reaction to the perceived attacks, and it was not pleasant. I try to teach my Probationers something that you actually taught me – to separate emotions from logic, not to bring in an emotional reaction where it is not necessary. It’s distracting at best and an insidious poison at worst. You’re of course, correct...funny thing about email...can make things look a lot different than they actually are. But in part, you were still correct...I’ve had several conversations w/Ed and he is familiar w/all the vitriol thrown at me from the ’50 Ways’ debacle. And I think he thought that I was still living in that time."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Further, he has identified himself a bit with the idea he’s generated; but I think he’s pulling off that affectation. He really seems a very intelligent guy. But take it from another intelligent guy...that don’t mean we don’t step in doggy doo-doo every now and again.  I'm glad you shared the email. It was something that needed to happen. I'm in a very positive place. I think it was important because it showed me some things about the nature of the occult community in general. Nothing about me is ever truly personal. To say this is about Kent is to give him a lot of credit. He was a little bit of sand in my oyster. I understand why it would appear differently, though. It's kind of funny that you come back after all that has transpired. It must look like someone left the gas on or slipped something in our drinks. In the time of Enoch, it was said that he walked with God. What this means is that in our pre-Cambrian state, we ‘thought’ with a different mind; that mind that today we call the cerebellum—the part of the brain that dreams and also handles our instinctual awareness. This is a pre-language (sotospeak) mind of symbols and basic urges. Eventually, that language was ‘confounded’ as we moved our consciousness to the cerebrum and the front of our brain structure. And here, the old symbolism became more a memory—when the dreaming began and trance & prayer became necessary to ‘walk with God.’..and also, language began. I read a Kabbalistic legend that Adam was capable of creating through speech, just as God did. The 23rd letter of the Hebrew alphabet, according to legend, was removed from him to make his tongue impotent, just as a letter was removed from us. This is the basis for the number 23 craze of the nineties. I, personally, don't believe in evolution. I think it is a dogma. I don't believe in the Bible either, except on a mythical level -- and even that from the opposite perspective of where I am. There are a lot of things out there echoing this language problem. An interesting story with this 23rd letter...that Adam could be capable of creating through speech shows him to be the archetypal hologram or template for the human race. This works very well with what I’ve been pulling out of Loagaeth and other Gnostic literature. But of course, there are yet several letters to consider that also are no longer in the language. One I found immediately in the research that was connected with the ‘th’ sound and the letter ‘y’ (giving us ‘ye olde store’); another combines the ae into one letter. You have had an amazing qabalistic experience and one where I suspect the Secret Chiefs spoke through you. But no truth is absolute as is no one person. Keep the ‘Aha!’ as a L.V.X. within and let it transform every cell in your body. I have been down these roads too. http://fraterphoenix393.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/27-path-tree-of-life-for-the-english-language/ The Y was the 'thorn' rune and a very attractive missing letter candidate. It failed on several levels, mainly that it is nowhere seen in Liber Al. To be honest, Paul, the first time I heard someone say the ampersand was a letter I thought they were over the deep end. I had regarded it as no more of a letter than an exclamation point. It is still a real letter, the last hieroglyph, and mainstream sources have proven it beyond a doubt. All argument counter to it is instantly outside the realm of documented fact. It can be a tactic of an ignorant force of language in much the same way that ebonics was once trying to establish itself. But it can also be the sign of a living language that takes in new words and goes through the inevitable process of change (in contrast with dead languages like Latin). Are you saying that Bling-Bling is a word the English language was missing? I don't mean to sound overly traditional, but I think civilization could move forward faster were it unencumbered by such baggage."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" I’m not saying anything more than the fact that it’s slang that morphs contemporary languages into future languages...at least slang is included in a much larger evolutionary and cultural process that marks itself into quantifiable units of time. A side note about Ebonics, it failed because they discovered it was a Germanic language (sub-language?). It is a fact that English speakers will create Germanic sub-languages, if they are of a mind to differentiate their speech.. The brain creates what it is used to. Of course...and English and German evolved from the same ancient non-Aryan (ironically), Nordic language. It no longer had anything to do with Africa or white guilt, so the shepherds of the black victim community couldn't make hay off it anymore and buried this idiocy as quickly as possible. Sometimes, social engineers just go too far...ebonics being a perfect example of such. It had nothing to do with African or English tongue; except that it took uneducated ghetto slang and tried to make itself a tool of greater communication between educators and the hood. This had more to do with the politically correct movement and the crisis of evaluating cultural groups that aren’t born into the Amero-European and English-speaking culture. Great cultures of the past created great languages. Liber Legis advocates a separation between kings and slaves. This is probably a good idea. Liber AL does not advocate the ‘separation’ between kings and slaves; it merely says that the slaves shall serve...but so shall the kings! Some shall serve in servitude and others in servantry. The fact that other cultures aren’t born into our hybrid-English culture & its Puritan mythos doesn’t make them lesser...the only thing that distinguishes the king from the slave is consciousness. Considering I wrote of this in Liber 805, I think I know that much...rofl! Sorry, Paul, I had forgotten about this being in 805, I had to re-read it. There's a lot in there. I think I do have something with the reductionary nature of the formula in light of the renumbering of Kether. Because it's true, isn't it? The secret house is the ampersand, the House of God, the Tower. The worship is about the Tower because the magickian stands on the path of the Tower (#27) and invokes the Sephira in his body during Star Ruby. I especially like this now; considering the qabalistic story you told me of the 23rd letter and Adam’s ability to create. Especially the cubical nature of 27. I'll have to do some more research about the 23rd letter. I was in the chaos days when I read this, so I saw it as a curiosity only. I need to track this down again. The Tower is the magickian. No, the Tower Atu is a glyph of the process of creation; for Crowley and in Thoth, that meant that there was the tearing down of the old Aeon and into the new one. But this must evolve to the establishment of those kind of humans ... whatever root-race (in a Blavatskian sense) that are manifesting on the Earth at this time in the continuation of the Platonic Wheel. I think I'm on to something here. House of God - Temple of God? Okay, check it out, apparently there is a lot of speculation about what the discovery of the letter should"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"mean and why it was lost. It was written about in Sepher HaTemunah. I'm trying to find a PDF. If there were 23 letters, that means our Hermetic tree would have been complete for Hebrew with the insertion of Da'ath, thus making 23 paths. Here is the only link I have so far: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_HaTemunah This was an interesting link; both for our joint effort and for some material for the Starry Gnosis. Enjoy it because that's all I can find. Everything is speculation, I fear. Aryah Kaplan has a speech where he mentions it. I think there is a lot to it, but the trail is cold. Well, there’s enough in what’s there...sort of like the eye in the triangle and the ben-ben stone...where the Universe is completed or ‘perfected’—as the Alchemists work to do. You mean my last e-mail regarding the negativity? I feel like a mother telling her kids to stop complaining and just get on with the real work. I did feel uncomfortable because I was the one who shared the e-mail from JSK, thinking it would contribute something meaningful to the conversation. I dislike negativity and personal attack in general, especially so in this case because I like JSK and always found him to be kind and helpful. Regardless, we move on. ...it did contribute to the final result...in, shall we say, a round-a-bout way...but it got us there; by helping us to find the right logical thread. This brought us to the Tower, which is on fire at the top and which has become the ‘holier place’ that RHK-god of Vengeance resides. Fire, as the element of Spirit...that fire in its material manifestation is a ‘raging’ force when burning down a structure or even harnessed more intelligently in a furnace (the alchemical furnace comes to mind). So the feeling of vengeance finds its way into a scapegoat/projection metaphor when it first comes to our awareness...but as greater awareness was applied, something really meaningful...a greater understanding of AL...RHK not being some petty vindictive god of vengeance...but of fierce spirit; akin to the hunter/warrior motif. ...makes sense, eh? You always were the master at turning negatives into something positive...LOL. Yes it makes sense – it first appeared that the fire was getting out of control, as fire tends to do, and needed some containment. Once it was redirected inward from the external focus, it became a constructive force. This is so interesting – the one woman on the e-group wants to “contain” (Binah) the discussion. There’s no such thing as coincidence; though we should be careful not to consider every event as an omen. Rather than type-casting energy...more a ‘Because’ function, going with the energy found in a qabalistic pursuit that engages ‘energized enthusiasm’ leads us right to that ‘Aha!’ experience and we have new Gnosis or we that much more, ‘become.’ And there are all the many forms of this elemental energy, as well delineated by the personalities of the Court Cards. Can we be tender and firm? Outrageous and Reserved? Bombastic/Pompous and Coy? Romantic and slutty? Macho and effete? Intelligent and hokey?...all these things?...in varying combinations? How does one make oneself ‘asar un nefer’? Did you know that 'coward and cower' have the same sum? The thing and the act are the same I suppose. I have uncovered so much strangeness with the Gematria calculator it is blowing my brain. Remember how I said the 13 peices of Osiris should be restored to 14 with the finding of the &? \"Phoenix 393\" = 1314. 'House of God' = 'letters' = 178. I updated the correspondences section of the page and attached it. Enjoy. I was glad to receive your letter today. I am much obliged. A discovery: "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"\"41. The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! O lover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is a curse. Accursed! Accursed be it to the aeons! Hell.\" Wife = 222. Refuse not thy Revenge, if she will! something to think about. So if we consider ‘revenge’ to be the holier place of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, much like the Buddha is the ‘refuge’ for the Buddhist awaiting enlightenment...the wife is the holier place, the mystery of initiation; holding the veil to the spiritual palace where we each ‘become’ and triumph over ourselves...revenge on the darkness (N.O.X.) is the effulgence of light (L.V.X.); though they each share an eternal relation and each originate in the infinite—one being the thought of God and the other, outside the thought and as such, the desire of God. Cf. my commentaries to the Gnostic Gospels for more on the ‘thought of the godhead.’ I suppose this Holy place gives us its broader unseen power. Perhaps it sets events in motion - an unseen hand. Of course, the spirit world is invisible in this world...but we can also see in this world an aggregate result (e.g. the market and its invisible hand ala Adam Smith) from the choices and actions of the many individuals that comprise society. When Osiris was slain by Set, it was Isis, his wife, who calculated the revenge. I am Libra rising and have thought about this in light of Treasurehouse of Images, but not in connection to Vengeance. I have thought about it in regards to balancing the Hermetic and Jewish Kabbalah. All of CCXXII from beginning to end is a balancing act. We are certainly making adjustments. I suppose justice hinges on vengeance. Is not justice but a vicarious vengeance? Through the medium of a legal procedure where one is declared guilty of transgression...of upsetting the natural order and in need of punishment in order to come to a new order; or the restoration of the old order...depending on the severity of the transgression. Well, is this not also the nature of evolution in a world whose formula is change=stability?...a world of constant change; constantly moving from stasis to disequilibrium and back to stasis. And so vengeance is always the new and higher ordering of reality and with the most egregious of transgressions or the most extreme of changes, it happens on a more spiritual plane. In other words, if the ‘crime’ is marcher, the murder victim is not un-murdered w/justice...but on a spiritual plane, the soul is said to find rest and so the loved one’s of the victim find spiritual restoration of equilibrium....peace. This law business ties into the title Book of the Law. I think we have struck at the heart of the whole matter with this. Law = 252 = laughter. He who laughs last -- vengeance on another level. AL II.63: \"Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration; the expiration is sweeter than death, more rapid and laughterful than a caress of Hell's own worm.\" THE OLD COMMENT Each breath, as He drew it in, was an orgasm; each breath, as it went out, was a new dissolution into death. Note that throughout these books death is always spoken of as a definite experience, a delightful event in one's career. THE NEW COMMENT This verse conceals a certain Magical Formula of the loftiest initiations. It refers to a method of using the breath, in connexion with the appropriate series of ideas, which is perhaps not to be taught directly. But it may be learnt by those who have attained the necessary degree of magical technique, suggested automatically to them by Nature Herself, just as newly-hatched chickens pick up corn without instruction. See Liber HAD. “Hell’s own worm” is, of course, Hadit. I have made another discovery: 'Love is the Law' equals 395, also coward and cower. This bothered me somewhat at first in that it might disprove the whole thing. The truth is that Just laws are based on Love, wouldn't you say? But it is the coward who loves because it is the law. He loves because he fears not to love. His love is of a discount nature, if it is love at all. The love of a dog showing belly flesh on command. This is the first half of our law, the half for the lower men. The second half is Love under Will, as I'm sure you know. This must be the Law for the courageous, who Love because it is directed by Will."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"I don’t know that I would go with the idea of a law made by man and written in books...but continue with the idea of ‘natural law’ like the law of gravity. And first thing that comes to mind here is: AL III.46: \"I am the warrior Lord of the Forties: the Eighties cower before me, & are abased. I will bring you to victory & joy: I will be at your arms in battle & ye shall delight to slay. Success is your proof; courage is your armour; go on, go on, in my strength; & ye shall turn not back for any!\" THE NEW COMMENT Forty is Mem, Water, the Hanged Man; and Eighty is Pe, Mars, the blasted Tower. These Trumps refer respectively to the \"Destruction of the World by Water\" and \"by Fire.\" The meaning of these phrases is to be studied in my Rituals of Magick, such as Book 4, Parts II & III. Its general purport is that He is master of both types of Force. I am inclined to opine that there is a simpler and deeper sense in the text than I have so far disclosed. Next to mind is that I think of the lover as opposite the warrior: AL III.57: \"Despise also all cowards; professional soldiers who dare not fight, but play; all fools despise!\" And don’t we “play” at love and in love? This line of thinking has evoked images of this scripture: 10. Get the stele of revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple -- and that temple is already aright disposed -- & it shall be your Kiblah for ever. It shall not fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day. Close it in locked glass for a proof to the world. 11. This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough. I will make easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in the Victorious City. Thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, though thou likest it not. Thou shalt have danger & trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is with thee. Worship me with fire & blood; worship me with swords & with spears. Let the woman be girt with a sword before me: let blood flow to my name. Trample down the Heathen; be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat! The woman girt with a sword is an image of Justice, wouldn't you say? Flesh, animal, and Leo equals 75. It reminds me of Christians fed to lions, this eating flesh business. We will trample down the heathen, those Kabbalists who do not accept Liber Al, with the power of this Thelemic scriptural Kabbalah. The beginning of this verse speaks of the proof: obtaining the Stele. Color will return to it. I take this as applying our ideas of Kabbalah to the Stele. This way we might obtain it and cause its color to return. 260= color & copy. I have a copy of it! 290= colour & geometry - British spelling used in Al. both spellings yield interesting results. I’m not really sure of what you’re trying to say here...but there is reason to consider this idea of trampling down the heathen; as you say. Any Qabalah must hit into the mythos of a society in the same way that Crowley has created something around which a minor movement has established itself within the spiritual/occult community. But our work here is yet, a tiny subgroup that I can’t count ten people are even remotely interested in. So we’re not yet to smite anyone or anything at all. Our triumph is the Gnosis we’re sharing in this dialogue and the fire it is fueling for us here...this is where our passion is best placed. Whatever the future will bring it will bring and who are we to presume we have any idea at all of what that might be; especially when getting a grip on right now is presenting its own difficulties. 3. Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them. 4. Choose ye an island! 5. Fortify it! 6. Dung it about with enginery of war! 7. I will give you a war-engine. 8. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you. They will give us a war-engine. A zen state? A holy place? Leah Hirsig claimed she could direct this force with a look, like an evil eye. None shall stand before us could be interpreted as 0 shall stand before us, Kether by the numeration of CCXXII. Very good!...I like the 0 of Kether standing before “us” in the City of Pyramids. But of course, that is far more an anagogic interpretation of the line. So rather, I like the idea of “none shall stand before you” with"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"the idea that “you” is each one of us in our own expression of pure will with no enslaver haunting our minds in much the same way that Hadit teaches that “no god shall deny” us. AL:II.22 \"I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie. Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.\" AL:II.23 \"I am alone: there is no God where I am.\" There is no God where I am ties in nicely with none shall stand before you. There is no God but Nuit and I. All other Gods are us -- or they are false. That is a dangerous heresy you have inspired in me. That's an uncomfortable level of responsibility! I don’t understand what you mean by this either. I wonder about our New Aeon. Is this an Aeon in itself, or is this a clearing of the way before the beginning of the Aquarian age in the 24th Century? There are a lot of leaves to rake up, if that's the case. Remember that the Aeons should not be confused with the astrological ages of the Platonic cycle. Rather that they are distinct stages in the evolution of humanity; the first being the Isis or Matriarchal period where humanity was entirely dependent upon nature in the most naïve manner; simply waiting to scoop up whatever resources nature handed out and women were like gods in that they made more people. The second age, the age of Osiris and the Patriarchy was when humanity began to understand nature and no longer depended on chance for its survival; but rather learned agriculture and to till the land, as much that men were involved in the process of childbirth. In a sense, we have the dialectic...point being nature as the divine provider and divine withholder...counterpoint being humanity’s transcendence over nature and the formation of culture and the city-state. The third and transcendent point (the Integral Aeon) where we come to see both that nature herself is wonderous and as divine as is humanity and in our transcendence of her, we return to her as masters of ourselves! She was the behind the scenes element without whom the revenge of Horus would not have taken place. Hell hath no fury, they say. But of course, Isis relied on Thoth/Hermes for the Magick...and it was their ‘belated’ child (not from any expected house) that avenged Osiris. This is a good point and it supports the mythological interpretation of events in light of Al. The revenge of Horus' victory in battle was the capstone on a much larger work. I suppose women are free from the lust for glory, to a larger extent. I wouldn’t say that...perhaps a certain passivity has been conditioned into them in generations past...but that’s changing. I would agree with the idea that women are changing. Everyone is changing. I wonder what Crowley would say if he observed our time for a month? He would note that in the moment the women have taken too much power and that the women have to learn to mature in their power. I could see this in the emergence of Wicca as a female dominated religion. They seemed to go too far with the woman power mentality, an over correction. This is probably for the best in the long term. lol...get into the Alexandrian group...”my lady”, “my lady” all over the place...and the men willingly make themselves slaves of these women...I know, I used to date one...and let me assure you, I wasn’t her slave. And I can tell you a funny story about this...remind me some time. I should take a chance to thank you, PJ. I have grown quite a bit in this last couple of weeks. I feel head and shoulders above my previous stature in Kabbalah and philosophy. Our conversation and your guidance have fostered this. There have been times I over-reached and times I stumbled -- missed the mark, but more often we have both soared. I feel like Liber Al is opening up! I don't think that's a hollow boast, either. I think there is a lot more gold in this vein of thinking.

But know the spirit of the Grade in every Grade has little to do with the Task of the Grade...it’s always something else. Here, you’ve got the spirit of the Probationer...but it’s not in your Qabalistic work...but that you care to reach into the world and see past the end of your nose...a place very few ever actually cast their eyes...though still, you’ve got some navel-gazing ahead of you...lol. He would give kudos the U.S. for creating this idea of a childhood...something that does not exist in history. With this, the peasantry is given a taste of the nobility and the Rosicrucian enlightenment by getting the opportunity to dream. It gives them a calculating freedom of motion. LVX disperses NOX via the machinations of the nearly invisible, but magickally potent wife. We as Thelemites ask our women to be loud and adulterous...and in the place where the L.V.X. disperses the N.O.X. it also inseminates the body of the Goddess with creativity. That's a good thought, the darkness of the womb displaced by the growing baby, a being of light. 10. Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known. A related side story: I was once fired from a job by my alpha male boss, but only after I insulted the secretary in an 'unrelated' instance. He had the power in name, she had the power in actuality. Puppetry. And how many ‘galant’ men come to the aid of the poor damsel in distress...apo pantos kakadaemonos!...let her fight her own fight. In your example, she disgraced herself and your boss sealed her fate in disgrace...both should be cursed. As far as disgrace is concerned, it is only applicable to those with grace to begin with. Some are free from the shackles of decency and shame. These people can be horrifying in a way. I think aspects of mythology act themselves out in our lives. I was Set dispersed by the champions of the company. I do not pretend that I was innocent. I insulted her multiple times knowing the ramifications. The result was sitting at home contemplating, collecting unemployment, and transitioning to a better job. I regret nothing. As far as them being cursed, they had to live with each other with one less scapegoat between them. The company went belly up not long after -- not because of my action, it was a national corporation. The handwriting on the wall signaled my exit and removed the inhibitions from my actions. Sometimes you just have to blow off steam and do what feels good. I move forward unscathed. LOL I have a riddle for you: \"57.

Also that it leads to 333 in the traditional scheme is but the 111 and the 222 added together.

For my answer I was thinking about Liber 222 in particular.

There is much wrong with the reasoning here...that the rationalization is dubious. First, why attributed the value of 7 to the letter ‘D’?...the value is 3; otherwise the order and value has no meaning or we’re wrong about the order and value. The riddle presented here must maintain consistency with the EQ. And there’s no way the graph page gives us the value of 7 for the letter ‘D’. All of this is JSK’s ridiculous idea. And G. Mortimer simply compounds the initial error by thinking he ‘discovered’ this. What discovery?...he invented this, as he found the end he wanted and made it work...this sort of reverse Qabalah practice is on a par with other forms of sophistry, like Christian Qabalah. And for your error; that the letters equal 400 and gives us the value in your system for the ampersand, what does that teach us?...where’s the sublimity and beauty that should accompany the solution? When you read my solution: The Riddle Solved, you discover that we get 93=418 or that 93 is also a glyph for the Great Work and that Liber AL is a key to the Great Work.

That 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27 tells us nothing because on the other hand, 27 is not a key...that belongs to 31. What about the idea that the line connects words that give us the following sentence...?... chance, its failure is a key also...in other words, experience (the way of the Gnostic) is the best teacher.

More important...for the time being, there’s still much more between 805 and 27 for your 222 idea to blend in. Had you put the ampersand at the end of the alphabet, then there would have been no contradiction with the system more fully worked out by Ryan and myself. Again, the parallels between 805 & 27 are wonderous and I’m not convinced that 222 has done this. However, the argument for 222 on its own is quite strong and I would sugges this: Put the ampersand at the end so that we get “x, y, z, and per se and” as the condensed word is a finalizing expression and not an expression for a middle term. Then the value changes to 900 and puts it on a par with the double-Pi of the Greek Qabalah: In few ancient Greek cities, the double sigma ΢΢ was represented as a T. This gradually took the form of a rotated Pi Π: , and in the byzantine times it took the name ςαμπι or ςαμπεί from: «ωσ αν πει» → (=as though -it was- Pi) *san`pi+ → *sam`pi+ *sam`bi+. Sampi represents the number 900. I've thought about what you said and I've decided to let the matter rest. I may have been rash or too close to the whole thing to get the right perspective. I'm going to put my grade work first and reconsider everything after some time has passed. I do have to address your last statement, though. The system you propose sounds like the Z.E.Q. I have no personal stake against it. I thought Cohen was very perceptive in including the ampersand but I think he didn't go far enough. I am convinced that the Berashith method must be applied to the order and value of all the letters including the ampersand; and I think the paths worked out in a very interesting way in 222. To my mind, excluding one letter from the method of the other 26 is like stopping at the finish line. & may have some things in common with sampi, but English is a different system with different values. I agree with you on all counts. Yes, the Task of your Grade is far more important than anything. However, that you continue to apply your qabalistic skills is a part of your Task. There’s a lot I like about what you’ve done and it is inspiring. There’s also the same feelings for the ideas Ryan and I have worked on. There’s strong argument for the ampersand and strong argument in keeping it out altogether as the natural evolution of the language has done. This is why initially I said...let’s pursue both tracks to see what happens. It’s even possible that both can have value. The problem with Cohen and Zintel is twofold...1) they got into all these values of less than one 0.011239455 etc. And these numbers are illusory: the difference between 666 and .666 is 665.334...so the two numbers aren’t even close. And the second problem is ego...they think they own their ideas and give the gods credit for nothing...they are the world type of atheist...narcissistic sociopaths...and I know this from living with them. I have to disagree with you again. The ampersand is a very well used letter. The fact that it is thought of as punctuation is more from ignorance and misguided education than any shortcoming of the letter itself. The ampersand is very commonly used in corporation names, especially in law firms and doctor's offices -- the legendary law practice of Dewey, Cheetham & Howe is one example. That it is not used in typed material is probably more due to it's unorthodox location on the keyboard.

I find it hard to believe people can remain in these mindsets when confronted with the occult for so long. You know what they say, people get the teacher they deserve. These people might not be ready for the introduction of infinite consciousness into their lives. It's too bad because I think science is going to go to that, in a big way with particle consciousness and quantum field theories. Knowledge is going to come out no matter what and I know these theories have been in the oven for a while now. A matter of time. I tell you this, not to toot my own horn, but I have found the secret to teaching children. You show them the Flower of Life Matrix first. It's like a magic trick to them if you get them at the right age because this thing just seems to build itself on paper. Then you can go all kinds of directions with it: art, geometry, religion, astronomy, myth, number theory, Platonic solids, Metatron's Cube -- or it can just be coloring flowers or a connect the dots type game. I was teaching my son about it just yesterday. My son would rather listen to me talk than play video games, not because I'm all that interesting -- no, I tie it into the Matrix of Life and the Tree of Life. Those are my hooks.

My son was particularly impressed when I showed him the Tree growing from the intersections of the Matrix lines and how the planets relate to numbers and how God reflects through the flaming sword creating denser realms and number and natural law like a lightning bolt from nowhere. It's not some dry, schizophrenic, Atheistic 'facts' like he learns in school, it's dynamic and exciting and unified. There's a story involved. It turns on both sides of the brain.

But more than for a few individuals; unless prophecy is accepted on a community scale, it can have no profound import; though it be profound in and of itself.

The problem with Ray Eales types is that they think ‘well and with business way’ is to make a profit...I think ‘well and with business way’ is about convincing other people to see great ideas. And great ideas are always ahead of their time; always someone that lays down and sacrifices (makes offerings) on their behalf. Thelemites still behave as though they were still Christians needs yet, to do this. But we are all victims of the conditioning of our culture in one way, shape or form. Still, some strive to see and others are more reactionary. In the marketing that we’ve been doing, well, it started with just me...Josh and Marc walked away, tried to come back to humiliate me and play ego wars...failed yet again and now have gone completely away.

I am aware that this is a bit of an outside view, but I pose a thought; comment if you like. Crowley explained, geometrically, that Kether was the first point and Chokma the second. By this a line could be formulated. I pose a different scenario. I say that before a point can be made, an intelligent matrix, an awareness must be found upon which a point can be formulated. Without this, observation of the point is impossible. The second point can never form a line unless the connection is observed, unless the points are charted. Kether, being zero, is the awareness in the empty space that must exist before any point, line, plane or three dimensional object can be observed at all. A point must be observable before it can exist. Kether is that prime awareness that is not a point in itself, thus zero -- it is intelligent space, but not a thing itself. It is an infinite perspective. It is raw, boundless awareness. The point is not the first step in geometry; the awareness that graphs the point is. This is the prime cause -- awareness fused into the very emptiness of the void. Perhaps it is like a child's awareness that a clean piece of paper exists without doodles -- a first cause that, in itself, does not mark the paper, but leads to its eventually being filled. By the way, I really enjoyed your latest publication. Very thought provoking. I particularly liked your treatment of the Sphinx. This treading on serpents business seems to be a recurring theme. Of course, your Tree is very controversial and flies in the face of the Pythagorean geometry that supports the traditional tree. The awareness that you speak of sounds much to me like the desire of Babalon, which puts it in the AIN SOPH AUR (the real zero or NOT). Kether is the concentrated point that is formulated in the AIN, which needs to be ignored to support your tree. This begs a whole new philosophy and geometry...so it would be safe to say you’ve more opened a can of worms than found a solution. But that’s ok too...isn’t that what it’s all about anyway? Is not the Thelemic Qabalah about innovation? With Tzaddi, Crowley found a way to innovate by re-establishing a traditional placement...an interesting balance for him, as it brought a greater symmetry to the cards; shown in the Moebius Ribbon.

I think our emerging quantum science places great emphasis on the influence of the observer. This observation of the original void of creation, I say, is the first emanation and not the point. I view it as the abstract zero of the Ain Soph becoming the very real zero of mathematics inside creation ('real' here defined as created reality). It goes from No-Thing, to the observation of actual nothing, meaning voidness. The zero of the three veils denote, to me, not a lack, but a lack of limit. Perhaps it is a difference between Nu and Nuit, Nu being a primordial, omni-gendered god existing before and outside of Tzimtzum. Tzimtzum can also denote the willed ignorance of God as a mechanism to enable true free Will. If this line is taken, the observer becomes much more important. I was thinking about the speed of planets, which is what got me on this track, not Kabbalah itself. I think it's strange that people say the Earth is moving at a certain speed. This can only be true relative to another object in space. Unfortunately there is no known stationary object in space, only other moving objects. True speed, therefore, can never be known, if it exists. The voidness of space is the zero point, the unknowable stationary point, that must be approximated somehow. Even this isn't really true because voidness cannot have speed or lack of speed. It is the observational point that precedes the mapping of the first point that is the most important aspect. My son was questioning me about astrology the other day. He said the school had taught him astrologers believed in the Geocentric model. I, of course, destroyed that misconception by telling him of weather astrology (and added the fact that Heliocentrism was discovered by astrologers). The whole thing is set up centered on the farm of the farmer who pays the astrologer for a weather prediction. This is why the almanac, I said, doesn't predict the weather much better than the news, because they are predicting for a whole region. Were the same people predicting for our own yard, we'd see a much more accurate forecast. Here again, the point of observation is overlooked and misunderstood. Each man is his own center regardless of what revolves around whatever else. This line of thinking can take us into the Axis Mundi, World Tree, Tree of Life, the Middle Pillar exercise, and beyond.

And you move here gravely close to Frater Achads reversal of the tree with the above statement...and for that matter, into a solipsistic argument.

Einstein also made the same observation of relative movement, until he came upon the speed of light and found that was a constant. From there, he found speed to be a human observation as time itself (the measure we use to judge speed) is really as solid as mass as it is inseparable from mass; space/time.

Each man is his own center regardless of what revolves around whatever else. A tropical astrology chart is geocentric in that Aries starts with the Vernal Equinox and has nothing to do with the Sun’s position in the sky. This is different from a sidereal chart which shows the actual position of the sun in the sky...and in that chart, the Sun no longer enters Aries on the Vernal Equinox. Sidereal and Heliocentric charts were once in vogue but are no longer used widely. However, the sidereal plays of great importance in ancient mythology and in what I call the Starry Gnosis. As a curiosity, in the EQ of Liber 805, Boleskine has a value of 805 (reducing to 13). In terms of Liber 222, Boleskine would come to 905. ...not that this means anything at all...I stumbled on this while writing another document I’m about to publish on the website. Unfortunately I don't yet have any other words reducing to 905 or 805 to compare. The pivotal letters between the two systems are k, j, z, x and q. These have different values and change the words they figure into. 805 was just anecdotal, but really meaningless. What becomes meaningful is to chase the words with these letters (referring to EQ Sepher Sephiroth) and seeing what they add to or take away with everything else that has been developed. After purusing through the EQ-SS, then through Liber 27 and the work that Paul Thomas is working on (Liber AL and the ToL), as well as what I’m about to put out this afternoon or tonight...(An Exegetical Inquiry into the AL Manuscript)."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" cf 93 I’ve attached something I inadvertently found in my files. I don’t know what this is off-hand. But notice the ampersand below the Z in the middle... Very interesting. I'm glad you sent me this. It details some sort of ritual and hand gesture similar to the Kabbalistic cross. Part of the text was cut off on the right side. It reminds me, vaguely, of the Golden Dawn's Rose Cross lamen -- particularly the flower petals with the Hebrew letters. It also reminds me of the knowledge lectures of the Golden Dawn. Perhaps this was a circulated knowledge letter of some sort for a masonic group. Interesting is the word 'felon' used to refer to the fingers. Felon is a very old term for finger joints. There is some sort of grip that forms the hexagram. It also says something about this being a 'key' to reading something. I've certainly never seen this before. Were there anymore pages like this? It’s an old graphic...don’t remember when I found it or what it might have been a part of (unless maybe this ankh ritual that a buddy once gave me in my caliphate days...many, many moons ago—brain cells too :-). I noticed also all the English letters...thought about playing with them. This ampersand sticks in my craw in the solipsism drives philosophers crazy; though it’s been proven as fallacious, solipsism still holds a few philosophical principles together. And so the ampersand comes into the EQ like Pandora’s Box—that once open, can’t be shut again. For me, usually when I find these kind of conundrums...I tend to be patient and let the resolution come to me. Usually someone or some tid-bit of information or some incident drives an Aha! moment.

I agree about the graphic you sent probably being a curio and not more, but these sort of things interest me. I like finding old forgotten bits of occultism.

I was stricken with a sort of guilt about my past as well, because I realized I had never loved anyone or anything. What I had thought was love was really selfishness in a clever disguise. On the one hand I felt really great and energized, but on the other I felt great sadness for my past ways. I realized, also, that everyone around me was engaged in this same kind of selfishness. I wasn't offended by this because it is just the way things are, but I had to forgive myself for acting like that -- and it was hard to do. I realized some other frightening things as well. I felt like my heart was expanding greatly and a surge of energy was going through me. I was not ready for any of this; it lasted for about three days and went away. I wanted to return to that consciousness, but was relieved that it had left. I forgave everyone who had ever wronged me, which is definitely not my normal style. I say I was not ready for it, but what I mean is my brain was not ready. My thoughts rebelled against what was happening. Maybe my personality feared to be destroyed by this new perspective. I felt like I was going over the edge. I was totally sober too, no drugs or alcohol. The joy I felt was like the euphoria of the last half of an acid trip. It was euphoria and total fear all at once.

I was leafing through the MS and stumble upon this old entry: 805 Boleskine, EQ (abbreviation for ‘English Qabalah’) This of course is arguably one of several if not hundreds of insightful synchronicities that support the original valuation of the English alphabet as given in Liber 805 and Liber 27. Of course my favorite is Abrahadabra which equals 814 in this system. As the letter has been removed from the alphabet...if we gave it a value of 0; we get the retain the synchronicities of 805 & 27...and get all the benefit of 222 as well. What do you think?

[11:22:08 AM] William Higgins: Though I've used and discussed many of them as part of my personal commentary on Liber Al... which is still in progress. [11:22:22 AM] Paul Rovelli: I've also very much liked the idea of figuring out how to get the ampersand to zero [11:22:45 AM] William Higgins: To me the only relevant place to discuss a Thelemic Qabalah is in direct reference to Al. [11:22:48 AM] Paul Rovelli: It's easily enough done in that the ampersand is a logogram and not a phonogram as are the other letters [11:23:01 AM] William Higgins: Yes... [11:23:08 AM] Paul Rovelli: ...except that then the placement on the Tree that Ed set up needs to be looked at [11:23:18 AM] William Higgins: Also it is the figure eight plus the cross of matter. [11:23:38 AM] Paul Rovelli: Yes, AL supersedes the Torah...which was only for AL's connecting justification [11:24:09 AM] William Higgins: It's really a glyph for the negative veil ain soph... since it contains infinity and its manifestation as finittude per the cross of matter emanating from it. [11:24:24 AM] William Higgins: I also see it as the union of the NOX and LVX. [11:24:59 AM] Paul Rovelli: This is also why such things as the Abomination of Desolation and other connections with Reveleations is so very important...we are continuing that tradition that is itself a continuation of something more ancient [11:25:13 AM] Paul Rovelli: It is this whole line that the Philosophus discovers and comes to appreciate [11:25:32 AM] Paul Rovelli: I like the glyph idea of the ampersand; cross and infinity [11:25:47 AM] William Higgins: Yes: 8 and + [11:25:53 AM] William Higgins: & [11:26:14 AM] Paul Rovelli: I've sent several messages to Ed and you...of our chat yesterday...he's not replied to them yet [11:26:15 AM] William Higgins: But there is something abuot the wyrd rune that calls to my attention in relating this matter."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"[11:26:25 AM] Paul Rovelli: I assume he's thinking carefully [11:26:32 AM] William Higgins: Most likely. [11:26:47 AM] Paul Rovelli: Got a nice message from Paul today as well... [11:26:51 AM] William Higgins: I would equate the ampersand with the wyrd rune.

[11:29:33 AM] William Higgins: If we keep the Ampersand as zero and put it under the first trigram... our successful gematria stays intact in addition to the currently existing correspondences between the English alphabet and the trigrams as they exist in my Liber 27. [11:30:01 AM] William Higgins: The tower atu should be P. [11:30:17 AM] Paul Rovelli: Ed has it on its order of appearance in Liber AL...this ups the value of k j z x q [11:30:28 AM] William Higgins: Which corresponds with the black brothers raising their heads... and exposing themselves openly. [11:30:42 AM] William Higgins: They are unbalanced, just like the P. [11:30:53 AM] William Higgins: They are caged in their own tower of egoism. [11:32:55 AM] Paul Rovelli: Ok...I've noticed also that he seems to be missing something on his ToL drawing...I can only count 26 and not 27 paths, which moves the ampersand off the tree to the zero point in Trigrammaton that you spoke of yesterday [11:37:02 AM] Paul Rovelli: Yes, the correspondences were brilliant...had you a chance to look at Paul's article on AL & the ToL on his new website? [11:38:04 AM] William Higgins: (2/1) * * --- Now cometh the glory of the Single One, as an imperfection and stain. The glory of the single one is the brilliance of the LVX, the divine light of nature and creation. This is the first departure from equilibrium since the silence of no-thing-ness must now be broken in order to express a particular idea. This departure from silence begins with the establishment of a creative potential. A tendency or a verge to motion which is the creative impulse; this creative impulse can imply the Fool on one level, while its creative nature indicates the Magus Atu on another. The idea of a single thing, a potentiality has now been introduced. This is indicated by the solid line appearing below the three points. [The letter H with the value of 1 in the EQ] The letter H suggests the arising of the breath, in a way it suggests the breath of God, the Elohim passing over the Chaotic waters of genesis. The H also expresses the idea of a ladder in its shape, so here we have a connecting point. The H is assigned the number one being the first English letter to appear in the Book of the Law, thus the singularity is the holy spirit of creation acting as a ladder to the purity of no-thing-ness; or rather, energetic matter in its equilibrated state. One could also add that it is the breath of spirit which ruffles the equilibrium leading to manifestation. This breath refers to the prana or chi, as that electric component of the ether which moves the prime matter into its particular forms. The Magus This idea of a single thing as the modus of creation suggests a primal creator analogous to the creativity expressed in the Magus Atu of the Tarot. The Magus is the creative Word and the subtle electric force informing all things, its subtlety and occult nature is similar to that expressed in this trigram. In the Book of Thoth Crowley explains that: “...He is the messenger of the gods, represents precisely that Lingam, the Word of creation whose speech is silence.”(Crowley p.70) He adds: “He is, in the language of modern"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"physics, that electric charge which is the first manifestation of the ring of ten indefinable ideas, as previously explained. He is thus continuous creation.” (Cf: Crowley p. 70) (3/2) * * - - But by the Weak One the Mother was it equilibrated. Here the positive assertion of a nameless something, that idea of existence in general given in the last symbol is now equilibrated with its opposite idea. Crowley often asserts that above the abyss each idea contains and necessarily asserts its own contradiction: for instance one cannot have even the most basic undefined sensation of ‘I’ or ‘me’ without accepting the awareness of that which is ‘not I’. So here we have the idea of negative existence introduced as the condition of all positive existence. This is a different kind of ‘not’ however, unlike the silence of no-thing introduced by ‘nothing in its three forms’ we now have ‘not’ as the negation of a given thing. This however occurs on a much more universal and broader level since we are dealing with existence and non existence in general, the universal archetype informing the existence and non-existence of all particular things. [The letter A with the value of 2 in the EQ] The value of the number two connotes femininity since it is an even number capable of absorbing the masculine potencies of odd numbers such as the number one. The letter A connotes a sense of beginning and excellence suggesting that the logos can only begin to manifest itself in the presence of both opposites, thus invoking the necessity of equilibrium in all magickal operations. The shape of this letter suggests man as the pentagram who’s fulfilled potential is excellence. His consciousness is the feminine vessel which equilibrates that light. The Empress The Empress seems to support the ideas expressed in this particular verse, since she is the ‘mother’ and it is she who provides the gate or doorway to manifestation and initiation. (4/3) * --- * Also the purity was divided by Strength, the force of the Demiurge. If we picture the two contraries just discussed, that is the archetypal positive and negative forces as arising on a continuum, like the poles of a magnet, we can see that there is no strict division between opposites introduced: just opposite yet complimentary ideas. Now the Demiurge as the Gnostic creator god or the grand architect only begins creation once the idea of division is introduced. The strength referred to here is analogous to the creative power, much like the creative maya which is magickally projected as an expression of Shiva’s potency when he creates the universe in certain Hindu legends. Here it is helpful to refer to Liber Al vel Legis. In chapter one Nuit says: “For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union.” (ch. 1: l.29) And she adds: “This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.” (Cf: Al: ch.1 l.30) Following this she prescribes the following moral injunction: “For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all!...” (l. 31) This is what differs the master of the Temple from the Black brother: the Master of the Temple is open about this selfishness and asserts it as enlightened self interest, while the black brother hides behind a façade of humility and selflessness as we will see when we look at the tenth trigram. [The letter D with the value of 3 in the EQ] This is one of the most obvious attributions since the letter ‘D’ suggests division. Also note that the letter ‘D’ can also connote ‘dunce’ within English nomenclature suggesting an ignorant quality as being part of the creative strength of the demiurge. This also deals with the themes of Liber Al in which power is associated with a-rationality: “If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops &does nought.” (Cf: Al: ch. 2 l. 30) The Emperor I associate the Emperor Atu in the Tarot with this trigram since the emperor suggests the intuitive logic used by those powerful leaders that are able to make those split second (and often arbitrary) ‘executive"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"decisions’. The Emperor suggests strength, and the strength of will to ‘divide and conquer’ a quality associated with rulers throughout the ages. (5/4) * - - * And the Cross was formulated in the Universe that as yet was not. This division automatically gives rise to an underlying structure of equilibrium informing the universe as it is created by pure will. This implies the cross which portrays an underlying integral structure upon which all etheric manifestations are based. It implies law and equilibrium and it is this principle that informs our sense of ‘karma’ which is not concerned with morality in the personal sentimental sense, but with simple cause and effect. In our imagination we can have whatever we want, yet we cannot create anything in our imagination without establishing denotative limits. To imagine a circle implies that it is not a square. If you define a triangle as a three sided shape then you cannot imagine a four sided triangle. Nothing can be created without these preliminary parameters; similarly even though a game is just a game, one still needs to invent rules in order to give a game its particular character. Thus the rules we encounter in the ‘world’ reflect more conditions of the human mind: this means rules for interpreting and perceiving the world in a way that is intelligible to our consciousness. Thus natural law as ‘cause’ or ‘because’ described in Liber Al is an effect of Will not the other way around as vulgar science would have us believe. Hume says reason is a slave to the passions. The silent self in Liber Al vel Legis exclaims: “Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite and unknown; and all their words are skew-wise.” (l.. [11:38:09 AM] William Higgins: Not yet...

Here’s a justification for taking the ampersand out of the order of appearance in AL; it is not a letter—not a phonogram. As a logogram, it is a non-letter and comes back to zero. The problem that you might be anticipating then is its placement on the Tree and I haven’t looked at this yet. But it seems to me we can find some way to keeping the placement on the tree in the same way that Crowley found the Moebius Ribbon for Tzaddi. About the new college it's hard to say, but the new atus is a given. [12:01:33 PM] Paul Rovelli: The new Atus would fall through Da'ath as its center...Da'ath becomes an active Sefira that has connections through both the rosy cross and the silver star I don't know what to tell you just yet. I was taking a break today. My son was sick and I'm not feeling much better. I'm a little drunk from the Vapor-rub fumes. We decided to watch Star Wars 4, 5, & 6. You guys really filled up my inbox while I wasn't looking, so give me some time to process the conversation. I do want to make one point, though. I disagree with the idea that the ampersand is not a member of the alphabet any longer. I say it is and will continue to be a letter until it is no longer used. This is the only requirement I recognize. It matters not who agrees or disagrees with it's status or how they order the letters, it is, pragmatically speaking, a letter until it is no longer used. For this reason it cannot be stricken from the true alphabet no matter what form the 'official' alphabet takes. I also think that in informal handwriting the ampersand tends to get more usage than Q and Z and J. I was reading an article that the ampersand appears in almost every European language. Try it out in Google Translate. I think the nearly universal nature of it cannot be taken lightly. I think it may be possible to keep it on the tree, much in the same manner as the fool as Qabalistic 0 is on the tree. I agree with you on the ubiquity of the ampersand and am seeing it as a necessary consideration. But a Qabalah is so much more than a single logogram...indeed, this difference from the phonograms (being the other 26) should give us flexibility."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"As you will see in the posts...some of this is discussed. == Sorry to hear you and your son have been ill. Looking forward to seeing you well and back in the saddle again. If the ampersand becomes the Fool...H...becomes the Magus. ...and of course, there is the issue of yet, five Atus to design...and maybe to re-design a whole new Tarot. 805 just addresses gematria and notariqon. 27 and 222 as well as Paul Thomas’ work on AL & ToL expand out from this. I think it also important, my recent work on the manuscript of AL and the work on the Starry Gnosis that I am preparing at this time. And the whole of the EQ has to find its way into the Thelemic canon that we include other components of the mythos and magick. And then the Tarot can be gleaned. I have written that prophecy needs a community to accept it...because it must en-fever (for want of a better term) a community...not just one or two. Otherwise it’s vain fancy...so that four of us together can lead to more as in time, we develop this more completely that it becomes edited into the discourse between teacher and student in the A.’.A.’.—and between congregant and mentor in our Gnostic churches. This is the challenge before us. something about H starting the order of the letters and Q at their end...HQ (headquarters)...the Alpha et Omega I don't think anyone here wants to exclude the ampersand from the alphabet; rather to recognize that it is of an entirely different character (pun intended) from the other letters in that it is more of a symbolic nature rather than a phonetic one. It is a single character that denotes an idea and a word first... it is also the only letter that can only be used for one meaning and which can only be used by itself. If we take it's odd nature into consideration in addition to qabalistic implications of it's shape: i.e. the infinity symbol with a small cross attached ( 8+ gives us &) we see a pictorial representation of the all as in the unity of infinity with finitude... the alpha and the omega, the hermaphrodite, and may I dare say the great work accomplished? p.s. Wishes of health and vigor to you and your family. My daughter has been struggling with the flu and I also just got over a lung infection... (not fun) but the winds of vitality are picking up for me again as I'm sure they will for you. That’s interesting...tying the ampersand w/the alpha et omega...as I was doing with H and Q in my previous post...and let’s now connect HQ – headquarters in terms of vengeance and the war-engine on that island that’s dunged about with enginery of war. The ampersand is a connector, it has a logical function, which is something that is much more than just a letter...and maybe in much the same way as in physics—where fermions are carried by bosons...bosons not really being particulate matter in the same ways as the sub-atomic particles called fermions. And the fact that the ampersand makes a 27 path Tree-of-Life available shows the new inroads to consciously that possibly even technology and the Kurzweil ‘singularity’ may be introducing. These may account for the extra five paths...and the connector...that mysterious link...the symbol of the Rosy Cross that can be veiled into the ampersand...this can also link the alphabet to spiritual force...that island, dunged about...et al. And it plays into the involutionary-evolutionary scheme that the Qabalah teaches; bringing the EQ to the status of a more full Qabalah for the philosophy, mythos and paradigm that is Thelema. "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"So we get the HQ, Holy Qabalah, plus (Hebrew Qabalah/ the other half of the Jews) Also a reference to the alpha and the omega which is contained in the ampersand itself. As a connector it is a glyf for the astral light or the ether which connects all things. This HQ is also the head quarters by which Ra Hoor Khuit seeks his vengeance on the Demiurge, which seeks to blind us to our freedom and divinity. Wow...HQ...Holy Qabalah...didn’t see that...cool! As I was writing my commentaries to the ancient Gnostic texts, I came upon some ideas in the Sethian manuscripts; that shows the Demiurge and the Savior cooperating in the creation. The Savior originates from the ‘thought’ of the godhead and the Demiurge oringates ‘without the thought’ ... hence in my view, the creation is a conjunction (ampersand) of ‘Is’ and ‘Is-Not’ or ‘within’ and ‘without.’ This in more Thelemic terms would seem to be the L.V.X. (thought) and the N.O.X. (outside the thought). It grants acceptance to the material Universe and not the abhorrence of what most scholars have attached themselves (being more interested in Valentinian Gnosticism) along with the extreme and nearly psychotic behavior of PKD. Hi Guys...another thought...perhaps even the extra paths on the ToL might be the four watchtowers of the Abyss...showing Knowledge to be an articulate chasm. Hi PJ, this is an interesting thought, though I'd have to really meditate some more on it. The fifth would be the tablet of union? I haven’t fully thought this out at all...it was just a thought that filtered through my head while I was finishing the Starry Gnosis book. I remembered something Ed said during the original 222 project...something like: Knowledge is not a strange attainment in the modern world. Then of course, there are the ‘lonely towers’ – and I thought, in a dumbed-down society as we have today and in more traditionally, ignorant societies, knowledge is something that can make anyone very lonely. It is a strange world where so much information is available from so many sources, but people are more dull than ever. Ignorance is a choice. Knowledge was hidden in the past, but now it is unveiled -- and mostly neglected. I do not complain, this is just an observation without judgment.

The rearrangement of the vowels in EQ (AOUIE) is worth examination. Note that the Tree Alphabet order is different again (AOUEI) - both EQ and older pagan cult alphabets give the 'feminine' O and U precedence over the 'phallic' I and the 'intellectual' E. The five RUNES = 73 = AOUIE naturally suggest a Pentagram symbolism -which may relate in some way to the five points of the eight year cycle.> But I >think I was too much of a try to even begin >experimenting. in retrospect my attempts in the seventies are positively embarrassing -but how else does one learn?> LOVE is 43, WILL is 56 (serial order). >>O well..... fans of the ampersand will like to know that >it appears in this order between b & k (in verse 6).B and K turn up together fairly often in these explorations, along with A. below are some examples:1. II 76 begins 4638 ABK,2. at the top of the MS grid (AL III sheet 16) with the alphabet (ABC)written continuously top to bottom you get: AKB in the top left hand corner (start position)3. in the well known 'nine fold order', you get ABcdefghijKlmnopqrstuvwxyz&(note ALW in alternate lines descending diagonally)The nine and elevenfold orders seem to be reflections of each other in cipher grid land - be it the sheet 16 grid or the QBL of nine chambers adapted to English. Experiments with the AJSBKT order numbered 1 to 26seem more promising than numbering the series 1 to 9 three times as is usually done. Note inclusion of the ampersand in several published versions of the so-called 'Pythagorean' order. Anyone know the history of this order & value? It appears in Regardie's 'Talismans' pamphlet and may have GD origins - in which case the relationship to the sheet 16grid gets a little more controversial!> >Another thing I noticed on recovering my concordance is >that the ampersand occurs 85 times, not the 81 >previously mentioned. On other hand, I counted the >printed text Liber CCXX, not the manuscript Liber XXXI. >My printed edition may have differed from the >manuscript. >qaballistically the MS is a must - pasting from right to left and from top to bottom gets interesting (a few years back the Word of the Equinox was divined by shooting a magical arrow at a big paste up of the MS before ceremonially burning same). Five by thirteen seems like thenatural arrangement for 65 pages. Note relationship between 'paste' and 'pastos'. as for whether there are 81 ampersands I'm pretty damned sure but don't take my word for it, checking and double checking is essential with numerical results and everyone makes mistakes, sometimes. Also there is the matter of the crossed out sections of the MS etc. etc. how many ampersands in those? do they count? etc. etc. etc. ;-)93 93/93AL-Ways JSK.

Perhaps we are talking about Jesus Christ in the hidden, Gnostic sense, as opposed to the Pauline version.

Liber Legis definitely promises the revelation of the new letters in English. 251 Revelations; old letters; The Revelation of St. John (which is almost always said pluralized, \"Revelations,\" by everyone I've ever heard say it) has 22 chapters, just as the old letters were 22 in number. I have even read that Revelation is explanatory of the Tarot. It's more often used as a tool of terror these days, however, which brings me to this little nugget: 241 Revelation; vampire; I think this captures the truer spelling and flavor of the book.

Perhaps we are talking about Jesus Christ in the hidden, Gnostic sense, as opposed to the Pauline version. I could accept better ‘Christ’ in the Gnostic sense...Jesus, though also the name attached is only in the modern sense a name with first and surname. In the Gnostic world, it was ‘Jesus the Christ’ and Christ was not a surname. In the original EQ, 848 (the total value of the name, Jesus Christ) has no value; nor does 655 (the value the ampersand position gives to Jesus). However, in the original EQ, Jesus Christ = Jesus/555 + Christ/193 = 748. 555 also equals Geburah, abstruction and peck (as in “I peck at the eyes of Jesus”) and 193 (same value in both systems) equals Holy One, Image of God, Saturnus, Creeds, Cries, Rapid. 748 (the combined number of Jesus + Christ) has no value in the original system, which is good again, because it’s not a real name. This increases the argument for putting the ampersand at the end of the alphabet.

It would probably be interesting for some qabalist to attempt to find a corollary between the Hebrew alphabet and each of the 22 chapters in Revelation(s). And perhaps, even some magickal value; may even cross-indexed with the English alphabet. Certainly, to understand the Book of Revelation in Thelemic terms, one needs to study Liber 418 carefully, as I’ve shown in my articles on Babalon and the Beast."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"I’ve also looked at Revelation from a few other angles, such as in Liber Restituo; wherein I show the letters to the seven churches to have some correlation with the seven chakras in a tantric process. And in other parts, we learn of John’s hatred for the goddess encoded into symbols of the Beast and Babalon; stated so eloquently in Peter Grey’s The Red Goddess. Of course also, the 4 Horseman are shown in the Enochian system with their sigils on the Enochian tablets...this feeds us back to the new paths on the ToL and placing them through Da’ath. 848 here does suggest something very problematic, first for the reasons PJ noted, such as Jesus Christ not being a true name. However I would add more simply that Jesus Christ is definitely not the key to the rituals as per the context of Liber Al vel Legis, and thus throws into question this current valuation of the remaining letters in terms of their hermeneutica value. This is a contradictory statement. If 'Jesus Christ' isn't a true name, then the value is not true. For this reason the value must be thrown out, or it should be accepted as a name. It can't be both. I assume these first numbers are a reference that you are using...but don’t know why you’re concerned specifically with 500 and above...it’s the individual letters and the values that are different between the two alphabetical structures that we’re trying to analyze. The values of 500 and above are important here because nothing has changed that has a value less than 500. Everything above 500 either contains the letters &, K, J, Z, X, and Q, or, if not containing those letters, may, in many cases, be compared with words that do. I don't understand your statement here when you write: This is a contradictory statement. If 'Jesus Christ' isn't a true name, then the value is not true. For this reason the value must be thrown out, or it should be accepted as a name. It can't be both. What exactly is contradictory about my statement? My point is that the value may indeed not be true: a moot point. I figured that was implicit in the adjective 'problematic'. Am I missing something here? How is my response contradictory? "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Sepher Sephiroth of the English Qabalah Cultural Points Derived from the Holy Books of Thelema Every religious culture dreams up elements; real and unreal; to enhance its imagination and aid in the expression of its nature. The Christists created visions of Heaven and Hell. The Buddhists created the Bardos. The Pagans created Hades and a plethora of mythic creatures. The Jews created Israel and Mount Zion. We could go on and on with this. It seems only natural that Thelema should evolve similar points of expression. And what’s even more important is that these old myths no longer serve is in this modern world. Liber AL and all the Holy Books of Thelema represent the beginning of a new mythos for our world.

Since early childhood I have been interest in psychology, dreams, paranormal phenomena, and the occult. I used to sit on my grandfather’s fishing boat, floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, controlling the waves and swells of the sea with simple magical words. It would be many atheistic years to pass before I would discover an interest in materia de spiritu. I was particularly fascinated by the relationship between ritual magick and the subconscious mind, what Crowley calls the Silent Self. This silent inner being indeed partakes of nature both universal and particular, the former effortlessly traversing time and space to bring us new weapons in our struggle to awaken to the true spectacle of the Universal Reality, the Lumen Dei (Light of God) proceeding from the Unmanifest. The conjunctio between these principles creates the Lapis Philosophorum and initiates revelations into the truth of our Personal Reality or personality, the particular nature of our selves, the Lumen Naturae. For Crowley, this alchemical Red Powder was Liber AL vel Legis, and the Lumen is none other than the L.V.X. I must have read the Book of the Law a hundred times since I discovered Thelema in the 2001st year of the Vulgar Era. The beauty and sublime simplicity of the Book fascinated and astounded me every time I’d open its pages. Slowly, over the many years of study- sometimes intense, sometimes fleeting- the seed of an idea began to germinate within my being. I began to see the opening verses of Liber AL as a flash of creation, a flaming sword of words piercing the essences of the sephiroth with great precision and representing the dynamic consolidation of the Ain Soph, the everything and nothing, everywhere and nowhere, all potential but not manifest. The verses of Liber AL flow in and out of each path of the NHSh (Nehesh, Serpent), opening up the four worlds of the qabalah as interpreted from AL III; 63-68: 63. The fool readeth this Book of the Law, and its comment; & he understandeth it not. 64. Let him come through the first ordeal, & it will be to him as silver. 65. Through the second, gold. 66. Through the third, stone of precious water. 67. Through the fourth, ultimate sparks of the intimate fire. In short, it was a revelation of the Lumen Dei. While I find it quite obvious that the particular nature of the Scribe (or Author, if you do not subscribe to the idea of channeling, received scripture, or prophecy) necessarily influenced the Book, the psychic and qabalistic encryption beyond a doubt proves the influence of the Divine Light, the conjunctio in space-time that provides the foundation for revelation. The expression was such a radically non-complex exegesis of this Light that I was moved utterly to share my budding idea with others. In The Book of Thoth, Crowley wrote regarding the Aeon Atu: “This new Taro may therefore be regarded as a series of illustrations to the Book of the Law; the doctrine of that Book is everywhere implicit.” It will appeal to the general interest of my audience to examine the Qabalistic significance of the individual verses of The Book of the Law. The first ten verses of Liber ALcorrespond first to the Ten Sephiroth, with the next twenty-two revealing the nature of the lesser paths of the Tree of Life- the Tarot trumps, the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and furthermore brought to bear witness upon the legitimacy of the English Qabalah as developed by Honored Frater Apollonius. Thus, we are defining the qabalistic Lightning Flash and the Return"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"of the Serpent. After the first ten verses of the first chapter, we are left with fifty-six remaining verses (56 is the Number of NV by Hebrew gematria). As the first twenty-two of the remaining fifty-six are attributed to the twenty-two paths of the Tree of Life, the next twenty-two could be the Paths of the Qlippoth (or the Tunnels of Set, the night-side of the Tree, etc., cf. the work of Kenneth Grant) giving us then a remainder of twelve, which may or may not be significant when considering that twelve is the number of the constellations of stars, the Zodiac being the fabric of Nuit. Our research as covered by this paper has ended with the thirty-second verse of Liber AL. Further investigation and meditation is required to test the theory of the remaining verses and their relation to the Tunnels of Set and the zodiacal constellations. For those interested, please refer to Liber 231 Experiments by Frater 493. In light of the English Qabalah, I have attempted to include the English equivalents of the corresponding Hebrew letters as I currently see them. And I have intentionally placed each English letter on the lesser paths of the Tree, aligned not with their Hebrew equivalents in Sound, but with their Hebrew equivalents in Value. This was also the approach taken by Frater Abraxas in his work,Liber XXVII. Crowley says in Liber 777 (and I paraphrase) that the relationships between the Sephiroth are not Numbers proper. This suggests, perhaps, that the Sounds are more relevant in between the Sephiroth than are the Values. Here, then, is another facet of this work that must be evaluated over time, through study and meditation. With the assistance of Honored Frater Apollonius and Frater Abraxas, I have compiled my notes into vignettes for each of the firstthirty-two verses of Liber AL. I can only trust in myself that I will succeed in presenting this material to you, the reader, in a succinct and cogent manner. Ten Verses for the Ten Sephiroth 1. Had! The manifestation of Nuit. This is the first Emanation from the Ain Soph, which is Nuit. It is Kether, the First Movement, and is essentially the ‘perfect’ initiation of the new diagram of existence, presented to us by Aiwass. Further, Hadit is commonly associated with Kether. At first glance, it appears that the I and the T (IT) are omitted because Duality has not yet made its appearance. The value of the letters H-A-D is 10, which is of course the complete manifestation of the number One. HAD is the I, the One- Kether. This put H as the center of the magickal formula. Cf The Riddle Solved by Frater Centaurus. Nuit cannot be without the many HADs. 2. The unveiling of the company of heaven. Chokmah, the sphere of the Zodiac, is emanated from Kether but still within that Supernal Dyad. The “company of heaven” specifically is these fixed stars, which are the personalities of the Starry Gnosis (cf. The Starry Gnosis and Golden Dawn Skies by Frater Zephyros). This leads us back to the ancient knowledge that was all but destroyed by the Black Lodge and is yet unexplored by most who call themselves Thelemites. It is precisely these fixed stars- and specifically in the context of Liber AL- are a mirror Image of Kether and not yet given motion, per the number two, and therefore are fixed. Not just the Zodiac, but indeed all of the constellations seem to be doors to the deepest recessed of inner and outer space- the connection to distant galaxies and galaxy clusters. The next verse gives us the definitions of this Company is Space, and the fourth verse then, gives us their definition in Motion. Of course, they are not truly ‘fixed’-everything is swirling motion."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"They appeared fixed to our ancestors- and to a lesser degree to ourselves in the current aeon- as a source of gnosis, because of our position on Earth. Should our position become that of the Sun, or any other star, our perception would be changed completely. This is truth both macro and micro-cosmically. As a side-note, I am reminded of AL I;50: There is a word to say about the Hierophantic task. Behold! there are three ordeals in one, and it may be given in three ways. The gross must pass through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones in the highest. Thus ye have star & star, system & system; let not one know well the other! Each star has a system of planets and/or varying accumulations of gas and dust, but also, each star is part of a Company of its own- a constellation. Though, from the vantage point of that Star, it does not distinguish itself as part of any particular grouping. For some other intelligence on a distant glove, our Star is a component of a fixed yet versatile image of gnosis projected. The Task spoken of in this verse is the organizing and testing of Stars- every man and every woman. 3. Every man and every woman is a star. This, the first real Revelation of AL, is the more tangible but still abstract idea represented by Binah. Space is thus created and the Individual life is formatted as a potential. Binah as the Supernal Mother is both the All-Begetter and the All-Consumer of Life, hinting at the Immortality of Solar Consciousness. This is also PAN, the ALL-Begetter/Devourer. Saturn, the planet associated with the sphere of Binah presents itself in exoteric mythology as Shaitan, whom Pan and the modern Devil (Goat of Mendes) was modeled upon. As a Guardian of the Abyss (along with Nuit and Choronzon), Pan or Saturn is the prosecutor (as in the original Hebrew religion) that tests one before the Godhead. More importantly, if we put every star together into a fabric, we have the Sea of Binah, which is obviously suggested by verse three. 4. Every number is infinite; there is no difference. Chesed is Jupiter and the idea of a tangible God. He is Zeus, who rules Olympus but forgets that he himself is but another creation. This indicates that while he (the Adeptus Exemptus) has reached the pinnacle of manifestation, he has yet to cross the abyss and mingle his life-blood with the Universal, essentially understanding that he is one God among Many, i.e. the Company of Heaven. Four is the number of the Square, which suggests the Elements of the Wise which, each contain particles of all the other, and bound together by the Spirit. All of manifestation can be described via a mathematical equation, and each integer thereof, while limited to certain qualities within a specific equation, assumes entirely different qualities in another. To expand upon this idea- and there is more to come of it further below- each Number is an Idea or a God in itself, as are the Trumps of the Tarot. Then can they be viewed as Individual Stars. This gives new depth to the Equation analogy, viewing each number as an Individual, some more simply constituted, and some more complex. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Understanding the infinity of the Universe is a product of the nobility of the King, who cannot be hurt, and making difference between one thing and any other thing certainly brings hurt. This we know from AL I;22: Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secret name which I will give him when at last he knoweth me. Since I am Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also thus. Bind nothing! Let there be no difference made among you between any one thing & any other thing; for thereby cometh hurt. Also AL II;59: Beware therefore! Love all, lest perchance is a King concealed! Say you so? Fool! If he be a King, thou canst not hurt him. . Connecting these two verses seems quite natural in this light. If one is a King (Jupiter), one will see that all is infinite and thus cannot be hurt- a simple beauty here that brings truth. A connection can also be found with verse 4 of the present work, and has also a relation to the Trance of Indifference. I surmise that it is part of the work of the Exempt Adept to transcend reason and thus duality to successfully traverse the Abyss. To bring this down to another plane, it is an adjunct against pigeon-holing. A huge problem in our world is the strict Binding of ideas based on an artificial reality-construct. Each number is a Being- or an Idea- in itself and thus its nature must be complex. This, as I have previously stated, pertains to the Trumps of the Tarot. In every moment of existence there is the perception of the duality and manifold levels of intricacy. Each number or idea is a universe whole, and so it is absurd to make black-and-white distinctions between anything. This is a partial meaning of the Yin and Yang. 5. Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men! Five is Geburah and Mars. Thebes is the land of the Initiates, and the Warrior Lord is none other than Horus, the prototype of the Adept. The Children of Men are the uninitiated, and in the New Aeon that this Holy Book inaugurated, Mars is especially implicated. Five is the number of mankind, the Pentagram: humans have five physical extensions from their center (head, arms, legs), five senses, etc. War is the nature of humanity, which can be studied in an excellent article by Frater Zephyros called A Summation of War. It is for these reasons that Mars is attributed to the number five and Geburah. As evidence of the corruption of these universal truths we need only look at the ideas of Universal Love, “Good Samaritan” laws and the championing of the Loser. 6. Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue! Tiphareth is related to the heart chakra, the Anahata. The tongue refers to the idea that Tiphareth received the energy from the Supernal Triad and is therefore its mouthpiece. Six is the center of the Tree of Life and as such can be related to Hadit. Also here are the Paths of Samekh and Peh, from which every magician in the Thelemic School operates, but this is of a different matter. Of course, there is the ‘tongue of love’ and the pearl tongue. Furthermore, Tiphareth is the Atman or Hadit. This verse is one of the many throughout Liber AL to suggest the sublime"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"nature and mystery of sexual magick, the spiritual orgasm produced by the sexual union between Nuit and Hadit. 7. Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat. Netzach is where the Aspirant to “Enlightenment” directs all his or her forces toward Tiphareth and the Holy Guardian Angel. This is primarily a fiery Sephira, and it is naturally passionate and philosophical, and thus, revelatory. This emanation is then transmitted to Hod, the Mercurial sphere. The Wand is the weapon of the grade of Philosophus (4=7 A.`.A.`.) and passion is the emotional expression of the sphere of Netzach. Hoor-paar-kraat is the god of Silence, the Greek Harpocrates, and this is, of course, the nature of Binah of which Netzach is the lower expression. That Aiwass then places himself here suggests the union of the above and the below. Netzach is the sphere of departure for Adepthood, where the gnosis supernal is at last directly communicated. Also, Netzach stands at the end of the path of Peh, which is the revelation and prophecy of which Aiwass is here conducting. Aiwass was Frater Perdurabo’s Holy Guardian Angel and every adept could hypothetically substitute their own Angel for Aiwass. Hoor-paar-kraat is the archetype for what is to the aspirant, the Silent Self, the Subconscious as well as the Secret Center, the heart and the tongue of spiritual consciousness. The Death Atu is on this path, along with Mars and Kundalini. This hints at the nature of the transferring of consciousness to Tiphareth. 8. The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs. This is a technical and scientific ‘revelation’ by Aiwass and fits nicely in Hod, as the mercurial nature of Eight provides a diagram ofBeing- that the soul is but another sheath of the God within, and not the ‘spark’ of God that we are told by so much religious doctrine. Hod, being of an intellectual nature, teaches us that this Soul or sheath enshrouds the very God that is commonly believed to be with-out. In Hod we reach the point of the assemblage of our spiritual paradigm. Our understanding (the Cup and ultimately, Binah) of the fundamental nature of our Self is formulated, and with that we are equipped to worship with integrity. In Hod is the intuition deciphered. The verse itself admits of an aspect of Hod; the vacillations, the presentation of the opposing definitions of Soul andSpirit. This verse sets that opposition aright. Eight is the sign of infinity, standing upright, and the Khabs is the ‘infinite within’ as the Khu is aethyric- the ‘infinite without.’ Evolution comes about as man learns to stand upright, and so by placing things in their proper relationship, the Black Lodge having given us this idea that life is less than an illusion, and even that the Khu might be in the Khabs. On this point I refer the reader to Crowley’s commentary on this verse: Why are we told that the Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs? Did we then suppose the converse? I think that we are warned against the idea of a Pleroma, a flame of which we are Sparks, and to which we return when we 'attain'. That would indeed be to make the whole curse of separate existence ridiculous, a senseless and inexcusable folly. It would throw us back on the dilemma of Manichaeism. The idea of incarnations \"perfecting\" a thing originally perfect by definition is imbecile. The only sane solution is as given previously, to suppose that the Perfect enjoys experience of (apparent) Imperfection. (There are deeper resolutions of this problem"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"appropriate to the highest grades of initiation; but the above should suffice the average intelligence.) 9. Worship then the Khabs, and behold my light shed over you! This verse expounds the Foundation of spiritual understanding, yet it has an intimate relationship with Da’ath the Night Side of the Tree of Life. It seems to contain a subtle warning against over-analyzing Yesod, where the energy from all the sephiroth is congealed. Yesod is, moreover, the foundation of the Ruach and has a line of sight to Tiphareth, which is the Sun, and rains down upon Yesod. It is this light that is to be worshipped and seen as the starting point of the ascension of Consciousness. This light that is first seen at Yesod is the fractured light of the Veil of Qesheth. It is the source of the infinite diversity of life- the many stars and their systems. As such, it is a very practical instruction in Initiation. The first decad of Liber AL is then resolved in the next verse and the primary diagram of Nuit’s manifestation is thereby summarized. 10. Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known. The number ten and Malkuth present the manifested world of the elements. There are Aspirants, and then there are the sleeping gods- the individuals composing the general public. This verse established the placement of Nuit’s ‘servants’ upon Earth- and these are the initiates, the very awake ones, doing their will amongst the living. The servant is the worshipper, Hadit, who is a king of the noble cast, naturally ruling the ‘many and the known’ as he is able to assert his will in this sphere. The verses corresponding to twenty-two lesser paths of the Tree-of-Life 11. These are fools that men adore; both their Gods & their men are fools. This verse literally suggests that it should be connected to the Fool Atu. The Hebrew letter is Aleph. Using the English Qabalah, the letter is H. Both have a value of (1), suggesting Kether. The Fool Atu, as we know, is numbered (0). The interplay of One and Zero suggests the First Act of Magick in the universal sense. Aleph is the element of Air, and H in English suggests the Breath. Interestingly enough, Crowley gave the letters symbols, as installed in Liber Trigrammaton, as follows: H- Forcible addition of pure breath to other sounds. Represents effort. I- Narrow breath. Represents concentration. Both letters suggest the same principal and the breath, the Word, may contain either Truth or Falsehood, which are identical above the abyss. The path joins Kether and Chokmah, and the Magus in the grade structure of the A.`.A.`. utters the Word. There are two types of fools: The fool who is ignorant of his or her true nature, and the Fool who, understanding the Cosmic Jokefinds pleasure in existence. In The Book of Thoth, Crowley details the “Great Fool” of Celtic mythology, which essential notes that there is a fine line between Foolishness and Holiness: They respect the wandering lunatic, as it may be that he is a messenger of the Most High. "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"This, however, is of men, Kings perhaps can perceive the subtle difference. Nevertheless, the Fool has been the most blessed of all men, holding fast to His place in the initiation of mankind throughout all cultures. I write specifically here of shamanism and note that initiates, enhancing their psychic sensitivity and gaining access to the highest potentials of human existence are the holy fools, “systematically putting the world on its head,” to quote Holger Kalweit, author of Dreamtime and Inner Space, a fantastic treatise on world shamanic traditions. The English H is essentially two I’s linked together at their center, and the number of the verse (11) is the same H but without the link. This suggests to me the interconnectedness of all Individual Stars, but with a necessary discrimination between them. H is also the connection of I and Not-I, the uniting of equal opposites, and the identification of Nuit and Hadit being two aspects of the same Whole, which is Not. Note also that Heh in the Hebrew is the Star Atu and has certain implications for the Neophyte. 12. Come forth, o children, under the stars, & take your fill of love! Hebrew Beth and the English A both have a value of (2). The Magus Atu leads from Kether to Binah, and the number of the verse (12) which reduces to (3), Binah, suggests the entire Supernal Triad. With this in mind, the verse follows the procession of One, Two, Three and represents the Will and the flowing above the abyss that also brings to mind alchemical mercury, corresponding to the element of Water. This verse summarizes the three alchemical principals of Salt, Mercury and Sulphur when we think of them as Earth/Body, Air/Soul and Fire/Spirit; consciousness coming forth from the Earth, appearing under the stars, ie in the air between earth and the sky, and partaking in the ultimate sacrament of the spirit. The Magus Atu is Mercury and the God Hermes who, in His most ancient cults, was depicted as a rectangular pillar, many of which were placed to mark the boundaries of villages and temples sacred to Him. At the top of the pillar was a bust of a bearded Hermes, at the base an erect phallus. Hermes was, among other things, a God of boundaries, commerce, etc., and the pillar could represent the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life- the bearded Father at the top in the Supernal triad, and the Phallus in Yesod as the generative Sephira. An important symbol here as in other verses, is the Caduceus, the weapon of Mercury/Thoth/Hermes, at which the shape of the number twelve hints. It illustrates the flowing of the Will around the Rod, Phallus or Middle Pillar, which links the above with the below. Mercury is this flow. The English A displays a downward facing yoni with a Gate. One could speculate the nature of this Gate; perhaps the Guardian of the Abyss, the threshold of initiation/annihilation. Further, the English A suggests an upright triangle with extensions which is the decent of spirit into matter. This theme is also found in the Hanged Man Atu. Also, “under the stars” suggests NOT and in taking one’s (‘I’) fill of love, one is acting with Will. The whole verse seems to say ‘love under will’, which is the work of the Magus. There is further a clue of sex magick implicit in this verse when considering that every man and every woman are the ‘stars’ that we are to come forth under. We are presented with this again in AL I;57: "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will. Nor let the fools mistake love; for there are love and love. There is the dove, and there is the serpent. Choose ye well! He, my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of the fortress, and the great mystery of the House of God. All of this and more is succinctly and beautifully expressed by this verse of AL. Frater Abraxas writes the following in his Liber XXVII: Here the positive assertion of a nameless something, that idea of existence in general given in the last symbol is now equilibrated with its opposite idea. Crowley often asserts that above the abyss each idea contains and necessarily asserts its own contradiction: for instance one cannot have even the most basic undefined sensation of ‘I’ or ‘me’ without accepting the awareness of that which is ‘not I’. So here we have the idea of negative existence introduced as the condition of all positive existence. This is a different kind of ‘not’ however, unlike the silence of no-thing introduced by ‘nothing in its three forms’ we now have ‘not’ as the negation of a given thing. This however occurs on a much more universal and broader level since we are dealing with existence and non existence in general, the universal archetype informing the existence and non-existence of all particular things. 13. I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see your joy. The Hebrew Gimel and the English D both have a value of (3). The number of the verse, Thirteen, is unity resulting from love. Also, the English B is formed by the uniting of (1) and (3). The English value of B is (300), which is Shin in Hebrew- Spirit. It is precisely that Spirit which is Above us and In us (Kether and Tiphareth). The Priestess (Two) connects Kether with Tiphareth, and She tells us that she hails from the Supernals and she is within us, at our center. She reveals the nature of that realization, which by experiencing that sublime joy and ecstasy we are at the same time fulfilling Nuit in her joy and ecstasy. More about that in the next verse. The Empress Atu is the ‘mother’ that provides the gateway to Initiation (as discussed in the previous verse with the description of the letter A), and as the letter D suggests we have the divisions of ‘above you and in you’ as well as the ‘I’ and ‘Not-I’ which are so aptly described by Frater Abraxas. 14. Above, the gemmed azure is The naked splendour of Nuit; She bends in ecstasy to kiss The secret ardours of Hadit. The winged globe, the starry blue, Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu! Daleth, which is the Door, and the English T- the Light of the Cross, the Cross of the Elements, and more sublimely the Rose Cross- both have a value of (4) and are represented by the Empress. The number of the verse (14), while revealing the formula of the Rose Cross also gives a hint of Kether to Chesed by the numbers (1) and (4), though this path leads from Chokmah to Binah. It is by the union of these two sephiroth that the door to universe opens. (1) is the unity while (4) is the quaternity. The English T is the cross of manifestation from which the process of initiation begins and the body is just as holy as the spirit. Also, Kether is in Malkuth, just as Malkuth is in Kether. The"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"manifested Earth contains half of the necessary material for the ‘birth’ of spiritual consciousness. The soil is necessary for the plant to grow; the Rose cannot bloom without the Cross. The T is a down-pointing phallus, diagrammatically. As a phallic symbol, it represents a positive emanation. If the horizontal line is Daleth, the vertical line is Gimel, the path through the abyss to Tiphareth. It symbolizes the supernal dyad emanating into manifestation. Further, the ‘gemmed azure’ is Nuit as the Ain Soph, and the secret ardors of Hadit describes the Priestess Atu reaching down to Tiphareth (the cross). In a different sense, the ‘azure’ is the ‘mauve’ of Kenneth Grant’s Mauve Zone. Put it yet another way: above is Kether and the Zero idea (the ‘naked’ splendor). She bends, i.e. accepts, the entrance of the King, kissing (the secret ardours of) Hadit. (Note that Ardor is a sexual passion) High sexual magick is here implied. The resultant figures are the winged globe (the glyph of Hadit) and the starry blue (the glyph of Nuit), which are Mine (Ankh-af-na-khonsu- the Priest of the Princes). The glyphs are the formulated ideas in the mind (Ruach) of the highest aspects of male and female, active and passive. Note that the Princes are Vau, Air, Alchemical Mercury, and the Ruach, centered in Tiphareth. It is the Priest of this collection of symbols (the Adeptus Minor, or perhaps even the Philosophus) who uses this formula to make sense of the existential crisis that is the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The English T expresses this formula well, as it is the glyph of the Rose Cross and the emanation of the Supernals down the Tree of Life. While I don’t wish to assume to know about that which I certainly do not, I think the Knowledge and Conversation would be a very serious event and difficult for the mind (Ruach) to understand. I think to the conscious mind still seated in the astral triad, the experience would be traumatic, in a certain sense. 15. Now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the Beast; and in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is all power given. They shall gather my children into their fold: they shall bring the glory of the stars into the hearts of men. The Hebrew letter Heh meaning Window and the English E, Energy and the “I” projecting that energy from three locations, and therefore suggesting the three Triads of the Tree. The value of both letters is (5). The Tarot gives us the Star, connecting Chokmah and Tiphareth. The Star, considering the value is none other but Man and Woman with the Spirit as the True Nature and Ruler of the Self. (5) is the value of Reguli, know in this lineage of the A.`.A.`. as Liber H and detailed in The Riddle Solved. Also, you are recommended to study the Formula of ON, Liber Laiad and Liber VVVvV. All this is about Energy; yet another synchronicity forLiber 805. The giving of this knowledge is the task of the Beast and the Scarlet Woman (Chokmah and Binah), as they are the avatars of the Ain Soph. One and Five equal Six, the Heart within which the Glory is brought. Chokmah, the Sphere of the Zodiac, the Logos and the ultimate nature of our True Will and the gnosis of the stars (so to speak) is delivered to us via our Holy Guardian Angel, and vice versa- the HGA delivers us to the constellations and beyond, as a window to those outer reaches of infinite space. The continuation from the previous verses is most peculiar. Liber XXVII has this to offer: Thus we have the letter ‘E’ for energy and effort, since the process of projection has begun. The point of consciousness or bud will has unconsciously fixated itself on the idea of existence"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"through its magnetic attraction to a particular archetype, and this results in that energy underlying all being. One should also consider that this imperfection is the dynamic energy produced by the dis-equilibrium of the prime matter initiated by the H, the breath of the second trigram being the breath of the eternal spirit. Thus Hadit is manifesting since he is the core of every star, being the motion that interpenetrates infinite space. Note that this is the sixth trigram, being the number of Had in the EQ. Had may be the central star of the Khabs itself as Hadit brings the Khu that surrounds it; also suggestive of the Beast for its archetype (and there’s the H again). The “dis-equilibrium of the prime matter initiated by the H...” is the nature of effective polarity between the genders in order to generate sexual energy. (Cf. Sexual Polarity in Magick) As we are the ‘children’ of Nuit, she reveals the nature of the supernal triad- they bring us into their fold, ie the Company of Heaven via Initiation. The English E- “I” projecting from three locations relates the identification of the avatars + the gathering + bringing the glory of the stars [to Tiphareth]. In short this is another simplification of Initiation in the Aeon of Horus. 16. For he is ever a sun, and she a moon. But to him is the winged secret flame, and to her the stooping starlight. The Hebrew Vau and the English M. The value of both is (6) and thus suggests Tiphareth, which is key to understanding this verse. The path connects Chokmah and Chesed. Referring to the graphic summary of the Formula of ON, we get the male and female formulae: Boaz/Strength Jachin/Establishment War Peace Nuit/Binah Hadit/Chokmah Cheth/Chariot Atu Vau/Hierophant Atu Connects Binah to: Connects Chokmah to: Geburah Chesed Red Triangle (Descending Tongue of Grace) Blue Triangle (Ascending Tongue of Prayer) Mem (Water)/Hanged Man Atu Kaph/Fortune Atu Connects Geburah to Hod Connects Chesed to Netzach Ayin Nun O N Devil Atu [joins Tiphareth to Hod] Divine Formula of Man Death Atu [joins Netzach to Tiphareth]Divine Formula of Woman Hod/Mercury Netzach/Venus "},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Left Hand Pillar draws current downwards Right Hand Pillar forces current upwards Towards the root of Earth To Tiphareth Manifestation, via Shin, (Fire) the Aeon Atu Exaltation Red Lion <Sperm> White Eagle <Gluten> Beast Babalon Vau has a double duty being also attributed to Tiphareth, which is at the heart of the Formula of ON. ON itself, is the formula of Sex Magick in that it describes the functional nature of coitus. Also attributed here is the Blue Triangle: The Ascending Tongue of Prayer. The practice of the Formula of ON is a living, moving prayer. It is the Hierophant of the Tarot. The Hierophant is one’s HGA, but yet in a more universal sense. He is describing both a formula for initiation (active and passive) and also He is detailing the nature of the Universe. Further, One plus Six is also a key as Netzach (seven) is the Point of Consciousness from which the Aspirant fervently directs the Will towards his or her HGA. It is the Death Atu that joins Netzach to Tiphareth (crucifixion), which is the formula of a woman. I am reminded of Patti Smith proclaiming the cross to be “the true shape of a tortured woman.” The verse here does not speak of the mundane nature of a man and woman but rather it gives yet another detail of Nuit and Hadit as related in verse 14. The archetypal male and female principals are the appearance of Nuit and Hadit in this verse. 17. But ye are not so chosen. The Hebrew Zain, the Lovers. The English N is yet again two “I”s connected, but this time they are connected at opposite points, which suggest Gemini, and the analytical nature of Zain, the Sword. The lower point is connected to the higher of its opposite, and vice-versa. The value of both letters is (7), and thus the passionate “love under will” that is but one aspect of Netzach. N further denotes the idea of love, simply by the shape of the letter itself. It is the coming together of two Stars, in rapture. The rapture is incomplete from a mystical standpoint. The entire universe must be formulated into the Single Idea, and the Samadhi on that single idea is the Great Work. Thus Nuit, being Not, is so chosen as the object of the divine love, under will. But, as much as Not is a key to it all, here, the ‘not’ of this verse might not be of that high caliber, as it is not a capitalized word. Yet still, the theory is supported by the N. The description in Liber XXVII supports this theory as well: The seventh new letter in AL is ‘N’, attributed to the seventh Sephirah Netzach. Netzach translates as Victory (as in Nike), and in the Hindu system corresponds with Ananda (Bliss). Nun (transliterated as ‘N’) is the Death card in the Tarot. The Bliss of Death: The Crown of All; “the consciousness of the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body.” AL I.26 ...and actually, this is how Ouarda’s “whiter words” renders it. Further, Netzach is Venus or the Scarlet Woman. ‘N’ is the initial of the word Nuit and Netzach is the lower manifestation of this."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Nuit is 49 or 7 squared by the English Qabalah. And Nuith equals 50 by the English Qabalah; which is the value of Nun. Further, Nuit can by symbolically examined as follows: N = Sum U = You I = Myself T = Light Nuit can be said to be the sum of you and I which is pure light (LVX) or the Breath and Logos when spiritualized by adding ‘H’ (value of 1) to get 50, which is the number of the Gates of Understanding. This by AIQ BKR reduces to 5; a number of Hadit. It also seems fitting here to examine the word 'Light' as it is connected with Nuit: L= perspective I= self G= aspire H= breath T= Intersection Tiphareth (T) is the intersection of all the Sephiroth but Malkuth and it is the Light (LVX) we Aspire to, the Logos or Breath of God, the Higher Self and the true perspective of being. This word equals 123 in the English Qabalah, which when adding the digits together, gives us the mystical number of Binah. And of course, reducing to 6 we get the number of Tiphareth. Interestingly enough, as a multiple of 3, we get the equation 41x3. 41 is the number of the Barren Mother and the Hebrew word for Mother. This suggests the Ordeal of the Abyss unto the Great Mother, which the Exempt Adept prepares for. And it is discussed in Chapter 41 of the Book of Lies. Tiphareth is the apex of the Ethical Triad with Chesed, the Sphere of the Exempt Adept being one of its other corners. The ThRShRQ of 41 (14) also works in accord with this as the Adeptus Exemptus trains the mind to equivocate opposites. But also there are the changing perceptions of the Universe that should be carefully studied in Chapter 14 of the Book of Lies. 18. Burn upon their brows, o splendrous serpent!   The number (18) suggests the Caduceus, the weapon of Mercury. Visually, the (1) is the staff, the (8) is the twisting snakes. At the top of the Caduceus is the winged globe (glyph of Hadit). The Serpent, as a cherub of elemental water, is related to Cancer. Cancer, of course, is the zodiac sign attributed to the Chariot Atu- the path of Cheth. Mercury is a primary aspect of the number (8), Hod. (8) is the English “I” and consciousness is traditionally placed in the center of the head, the Ajna Chakra, the symbol of which is also the winged globe. “I” is Hadit. Also, in the Egyptian culture, the Uraeus serpent wraps around the solar disk upon the heads of all holy figures, both protecting the solar disk, and indicating the nature of its function. Note also that all the work takes place in the 9th House (according to the Wake World), the astral plane where the inner eye sees. The ‘I’ is also the ‘eye’, the Eye of Horus, as well as the Eye of Shiva. In Hindu mythology, the manifested world is said to be the dream of the sleeping Deity. Should Deity awaken and open his eyes (Eye, Ajna) the world of forms would be destroyed. This is one way to see the serpent, burning upon the brow. This is more eloquently expounded in the Upanishads, where Indra (Zeus) is confronted with the idea of the sleeping Vishnu, from whose navel issues forth a lotus. Brahma (the Hindu creator god, who is not unlike Zeus) sits upon the lotus, directing the manifested world. Vishnu represents the void or the Ain Soph, and should he awake from his slumber, the entire universe would be annihilated. Worlds are thus created and destroyed in the blinking of an eye. "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Hebrew gives us Cheth which means Fence, as in the fencing-in. This, the path of the Chariot Atu, leads from Binah to Geburah. The Serpent- water, blood- descends from Binah the Mother and creates Geburah, the fiery strong aspect of the Son. 19. O azure-lidded woman, bend upon them! Hebrew Teth and English F, both have a value of (9). The shape of the English F suggests an ‘I’ with two horizontal posts issuing forth, going, moving, establishing their presence in the Supernal Triad and the Ethical (so-called) Triad of the Tree, or the connection of Binah to Chokmah and Geburah to Chesed, between these two connections is the Fence, the Veil, the Abyss. Teth means Serpent. This and the previous verse are intimately entwined, as I hope I’ve demonstrated. The Number here relates to the Serpent, while the previous verse related to the Fence, which begins with the English F. (9) is the eleventh Trump, the Lust Atu- Babalon astride the Beast. These synchronicities truly show the praeter-human nature of AL. Here is a more ‘clothed’ form of Binah, the “mistress of All” holding her hand to the sky, collecting the Blood or life-force from above, as noted in the previous verse. As a compliment to the previous verse, the ‘azure-lidded woman’ is Nuit, but really that aspect of her as Initiatrix, thus it is not the interaction of Binah and Chokmah, but of Chesed and Geburah. It is that fiery rapture suggested in the previous verse. The Initiatrix “bends upon them” overcoming them as “the kisses of the stars, rain hard upon thy body” (AL II;62). The two verses are the formulae of initiation, which must be both active and passive. The serpent is also that of Liber LXV, Chapter One, Verse One: “I am the heart and the snake is entwined...” The product of Chesed and Geburah is Tiphareth, the Center of the Tree and the Holy Guardian Angel. 20. The key of the rituals is in the secret word which I have given unto him. Hebrew Yod and English S, both a value of (10). Yod means hand, perhaps as the operational weapon. The Hermit Atu connects Chesed with Tiphareth. The card is associated with Virgo of the zodiac, and all virgin goddesses are here- the virgin Isis, Athena, Artemis, and Hestia in the Greek. This verse of AL reminds one of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which bestowed upon its Initiates the secret key to immortality which, in the Aeon of Horus, is ABRAHADABRA. This Word has been extrapolated much in Thelemic writings, so I will not digress. I will note, however, that HAD equals 10 via the Hebrew values (the remaining letters equal 408, which is 12). “Virgin” in the EQ is 223 or 7, Netzach and the sexual passion. The English S is the first letter of Sperm, value=201. Similarly, the shape of the Yod is not that different from our English S. Both suggest also a serpent. It seems again we have established the sexual nature of Initiation, but of course not the mundane intercourse such that the Nephesh seeks, but the more sublimated intercourse of Soul and Spirit. The Virgin is ever the Virgin; She awaits eternally the seed from Above, yet she contains a seed of her own. SEED in English is 23=5, the number of Man and Geburah. Seed in Hebrew is Zain Lamed Ayin=107=8, Cheth and the Chariot. The Key of the Rituals that is formulated in ABRAHADABRA, is also the formula of the Rose Cross. It is the most supreme ritual on all planes. From farmer planting seed in the moist earth, to the Holy Guardian Angel planting His own seed into the Virgin Aspirant, bringing Her thereby to the Throne of Binah, and Himself to the Throne of the King. Without Malkuth, there is no opportunity, or no need, for redintigration. "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"What actually does prove a bit sublime is that Yod is the key to the Hebrew alphabet. All the letters are really just complex organizations of the letter. That the serpent has an attributable connection to the spermatozoa and we know that sexual energy is the key to evolutionary enlightenment, there is a profound connection to this verse. 21. With the God & the Adorer I am nothing: they do not see me. They are as upon the earth; I am Heaven, and there is no other God than me, and my lord Hadit. Hebrew Kaph and English O, value have a value of (20) which reduces to (2), Chokmah, the Sphere of the Zodiac, i.e. Heaven. Nuit says that it is She as well as Hadit who are the supreme Gods. Chesed (Jupiter and Zeus) connects to Netzach (Venus and Aphrodite) via the path of Fortune, Kaph, the Palm. The Palm suggests an offering and it is indeed the Philosophus who offers up all that he or she is to the Holy Guardian Angel. Chesed is also the frontier of the Abyss. The English O suggests a Wheel (the Wheel of Fortune, luck). Nuit is the infinitely expanded circumference, while Hadit is the Axle. AL II;7-8: 7. I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. \"Come unto me\" is a foolish word: for it is I that go. 8. Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper. The God and the Adorer could be Hadit, the unextended, infinitely contracted One whose house is the Khabs. To that “Being” Nuit would appear in all Her glory- the Ain Soph. It is said in Greek mythology that should any god reveal their true nature to a ‘mortal’, the glory would incinerate them. (This relates to the Christian Mysteries, also). Alternatively, from one’s position in Malkuth, God, i.e. Nuit, would appear as relative nothingness, or the absence of Things. Should one ascend to the conscious understanding of Things, i.e. Chesed, one would then have the potential to perceive Nuit in All Her Glory, and thus be ‘incinerated’ or ‘annihilated’, via the crossing of the Abyss. 22. Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secret name which I will give him when at last he knoweth me. Since I am Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also thus. Bind nothing! Let there be no difference made among you between any one thing & any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt. Hebrew Lamed and the English U, both with a value of (30). This is the path of Adjustment (previously called Justice) in the Tarot, and connects Geburah with Tiphareth. It is also the feminine counterpart of the Fool, cf. The Book of Thoth. According to that book, also, Adjustment symbolizes the final operation of the Tetragrammaton, with the Daughter being set upon the throne of the Mother by the Son. The first line of this verse is prophetic of the entire Rosey Triad. Top down, it suggests the HGA issuing forth from above, into Tiphareth, bringing with Him those mysteries. Bottom up, it is the Adept conversing with the Angel, with the ultimate Work to be Union with Nuit (the Supernal Triad and perhaps even unto the Ain Soph). Lamed is Libra, balance, and the English U, while appearing to be two I’s balancing on an upward arch, the U is also a cup or container that hangs from the Scale of Justice. The letter could also be seen as a scale in itself. The remaining lines of this verse describe the essential nature of Adjustment. “Hurt” is brought about by the apparent duality of existence and the knowledge of pain, death and pleasure and life. Note AL;II: 6. I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death. "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"This verse (AL II;6) is the perfect complement of AL;I: 6. Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue! The Universe is perfect just the way it is; everything is as it should be. Nuit is instructing us to ‘bind nothing’. The first interpretation of this is non-discrimination between impressions of any kind (this relates to my comments on AL I;4) and the uniting of opposites (as well as the Samadhi on the entire universe which I have said in a previous comment) yet She is at the same time instructing us to be Hadit, a separate (while still identical) Being. The creation of this duality naturally brings about the perception of difference between Things and an apparent contradiction. “Bind nothing”, in the second interpretation, means to literally Bind Nothing, i.e. take the intangible Ain Soph and create Forms and Things, so that thereby we can come to know Nuit. “... difference made among you...” suggests the “Company of Heaven”, and as infinite Stars in the body of Nuit, we are all to understand and assert with strength the infinite nature of all other Stars. 23. But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all! Hebrew Mem and the English V. The value of both letters is (40). The English V is the sign of victory and he that ‘availeth’ is of course, the chief. The V is also the Roman numeral (5), which is the sum of the digits of this verse (2+3). The English V is the sign of Apophis and Typhon, according to the LVX signs. In this regard, the V (Apophis /Typhon) represents a rather transformative quality of the formula of the Rose Cross and the mysteries of Tiphareth per the symbolic Death undergone in that sphere. What is to be built must first be torn down. Typhon is a Greek ‘monster’ to whom serpents are attributed. He is said to have battled Zeus, the Father of the Gods, after scaring off all the other Olympian Gods. In regards to the formula of LVX, note that Zeus triumphed in the battle with Typhon, who is Set, the shadowy brother of Horus, in the Egyptian mythos. Zeus, as a representative of Chesed and Jupiter, should bring this comment full-circle. Apophis is the adversary of the Sun god in the Egyptian mythos. Implied here is also the Hero’s Journey- the embarking on a journey, the tests and battles in the Underworld, and the victorious reemerging and returning home, usually then becoming a King. Both Apophis and Typhon are related to Water, specifically the Nile River, which was either Creative or Destructive in that ancient society. Both Gods were said to be opposed to the Sun god, attempting to hinder His rising in the East. Note that the tradition of the Old Aeon was the Sun dying each night (and each autumn) via a battle with the shadow God, the Serpent, the Water, etc. Also, it is Horus the Avenger that avails the death of Osiris at the hands of Set. Set/Typhon is not the winner in the end but the loser, and death is overcome. The Hanged Man Atu. Here again is the Serpent, as cherub of Water connecting Geburah with Hod. In this aspect, the Serpent is the creator and the destroyer. Geburah is the martial aspect of the Cosmoses, suggesting war, destruction and discord. Hod is the sphere of structure, systems of all types, knowledge and order. The Atu suggests Death, but not the Death we find in the next Trump. Instead, it is the Water of the Subconscious that must be confronted before any spiritual growth is possible. This verse of AL seems to delineate this mystery, and should the initiate understand and pass through this mystery, he or she shall attain to the pinnacles of Nuit’s blessing and a full initiation in to the new"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Aeon, where “God” is not the dying/resurrected Father, but the ever-brilliant and innocent Child. Also, the “chief of all” could be Chesed and Zeus, the Chief of all Gods. 24. I am Nuit, and my word is six and fifty. Hebrew Nun and the English L, both have a value of (50), and the sum of the digits of the verse is (6). Nun phonetically, gives usnone or Not- Nuit. Even the L gives us El, the Hebrew suffix for God and the title of this, The Book of the Law (Liber AL). (50) of course, is the Death Atu and Scorpio of the Zodiac, both intimately connected to the alchemical process of putrefaction or fermentation. As the old reality construct or paradigm decomposes in the moist death, the spiritual seed planted by the Hermit sprouts. The Elements of Personality having been built up by one’s work in the Astral Triad are here used as a fertilizer for the spiritual seed, or Yod. It is here, in the moving of consciousness from Netzach to Tiphareth that this fermentation is undergone and the Philosophus becomes the Adept after piercing the veil of Paroketh. The Death Atu is three-fold in nature. The Scorpion is the lowest form of this energy, symbolizing the passive acceptance of death and the initial stage of the putrefaction. Next is the Serpent, which is the mercurial stage, the stage where the base elements are converted to the more sublime and where a colored film collects on the surface of our Material, which relates to the alchemical Peacock’s Tail, and in a more hidden sense the Veil of Qesheth. We have seen as a constant symbol throughout this commentary the Serpent. The Serpent is an important theme as it represents both life and death and the workings of each. In this commentary the Serpent has been linked with the Chariot Atu and verse eighteen, the Lust Atu and verse nineteen, the Hermit and verse twenty, the Hanged Man and verse twenty-three, and here in the Death Atu and verse twenty four. The number of each verse gives us (104), which is the law of the earth and reduces to (5). The value of the English and Hebrew letters gives us (117), the secret magick of Netzach. (117) reduces to (9), Teth, the Serpent. Nine is also Yesod, the generative Sephira, giving us the bottom-up source of our spiritual prowess. The third stage of putrefaction or fermentation is the Eagle, which soars in the air above the earth and represents the product of the preceding stages. The Eagle is the gaseous element that rises from the ruins, or the perfume of the gods. The Paths of Samekh and Peh form an equilateral triangle with Nun, and this is suggested by the English L, but with Nun invisible, or non-existent. This is important as death indicates the lack of life, or the proceeding into what lies beneath (or beyond) the threshold. This intersection (Samekh and Peh) is where the magickian begins his rites, which ultimately culminate in the perception of the White Swan (cf., LXV II;17). He or she is thereby carried to Death (putrefaction) and the ascension to Tiphareth. 25. Divide, add, multiply, and understand. Hebrew Samekh and the English G, both letters have a value of (60). Sixty as Six and Zero is Tiphareth and the Ain. When we divide Nuit’s number, 65, we get 0.12, which suggests Her manifestation and the Company of Heaven. It is also 210, which is the number of verses left after the first ten numbers (Sephiroth). Note my comment to verse nine. The first Decad of AL is then resolved in the following verse and the primary diagram of Nuit’s manifestation summarized. "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The work here is validated thereby. The original plan was fully delineated in the first ten verses of AL, the remaining verses are the elaboration upon the plan. The division, addition, and multiplication is based upon the first ten numbers (but really just the first nine), as we know from elementary mathematics. Everything that follows the first ten is used to understand the details of Her Word. Samekh is a prop; the logical prop here being mathematics, and G is the Masonic letter of God and G in the EQ means to ‘aspire’- in this context- unto Nuit, and Binah/Understanding. The English G represents the Sperm penetrating the Ovum, and thus shows the interconnectedness of the entire scheme. Note that in The Book of Thoth, the 9th degree O.T.O. is connected with the Art Atu, which connects Yesod to Tiphareth. This can be seen as a sexual-spiritual intercourse between the Prince and the Princess and that ecstasy is of Fire. Sagittarius is further the Arrow that pierces the veil of Qesheth. Two plus Five is Seven, Netzach, which suggests again, love under will. The addition of six and five gives us eleven, the number of magick and the verse of AL attributed to the Fool. The multiplication gives us either thirty or three hundred. Thirty is Adjustment, the feminine counterpart of the Fool, and three hundred is Shin, the Aeon Atu. 26. Then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one: Who am I, and what shall be the sign? So she answered him, bending down, a lambent flame of blue, all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thou knowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body. Hebrew Ayin and the English C, which are both (70), and link Hod with Tiphareth. If we think of Yesod, Hod and Netzach as the Hindu Sat, Chit, Ananda, with Tiphareth as the spiritual consciousness itself, this path (and this verse) is a demonstration of the intellect infused with the intuition. In the Tarot we have the Devil, which is another symbol of Pan and ultimately Nuit as Pan is All, Nuit is Not-All. The Devil is further a glyph of the creative male energy, and teamed up with the Death and Art Trumps it completes the Being, Knowledge, Bliss that Nuit speaks of here. The addition of the Aeon and Moon Trumps, we see Her hands and feet upon the black earth. Two and six are eight. It seems this verse describes the only way that Nuit way be “known” in the Ruach, and that is by knowing Her manifestations, All of them. Ayin means Eye, and what does the eye do but “see”? The Eye, or I is Hadit, the Knower. 27. Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous! Hebrew Peh and the English P, and both are (80). Peh is Mouth, from which Prophecy is uttered. It is to be remembered that this Path is what must be crossed by Art to reach Tiphareth. In a simple sense, the gnosis which is only communicable through Tiphareth, is felt and then understood in the Ruach via Netzach and Hod. Here we have the Tower Atu connecting Hod with Netzach. On these lower planes, this indicates the breaking down of one’s reality construct as well as the apparent war that exists between the reason and the emotion."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" The number of the verse, twenty-seven, suggests Wisdom’s influence on Passion and I’m sure to any scholar of Greek mythology there will be synchronicity here. This number also gives us (9), Yesod, the generative Sephira which is as essential on the Tree as Kether and Tiphareth, for without it there could never be any manifestation of Will, and thus no opportunity for Will to return to its source. (The perfume of this verse relates a mystery of Yesod and the Zelator of the A.`.A.`.) Certainly in this verse, Peh is the ‘speaking’. That we are to speak of Her not as One, but as None, reflects the nature of the Tower Atu. Crowley writes in The Book of Thoth, that “the ultimate reality (which is Perfection) is Nothingness.” This Verse and Path describe the operation of uniting opposites, the freeing of Consciousness from its dualistic chains. The Tower represents the breaking down of the manifested universe to reveal what is beyond. That we should speak not of Her at all, indicates Silence, as Nuit is beyond speech (and silence, but silence is the closest we can get in our manifested world to describing Her). 28. None, breathed the light, faint & faery, of the stars, and two. Hebrew Tzaddi and the English Y, both are (90). The Trump is the Emperor, linking Netzach to Yesod. The Emperor is the spiritual authority below the abyss, and it is Netzach which receives the influx of energy from Tiphareth. This influx must be harnessed and manifested via the Emperor and Yesod. The verse seems to perhaps answer a subconscious question regarding the previous verse, “Why?” (This is a shadow of what is to come regarding Why in Chapter 3). Nuit’s answer is the elaboration of Her formula, 0=2, as suggested in the previous verse. This formula is what the Emperor administers to the lower manas and the subconscious. 29. For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. Hebrew Qoph and the English R. Both letters are value (100) and the Moon Atu. The Moon connects Netzach with Malkuth. (29) hints at the Zelator of the A.’.A.’. who is seated in Yesod, the Moon). Qoph translates as the ‘back of the head’. It is written in various places including somewhere in the Equinox, that those who become Aspirants to the Mysteries had from their earliest memories some ‘thing’ in the back of their mind that pushed them to seek the beyond. I think this could be the influence of Netzach on Malkuth in Assiah. It is the sense of division from ‘something else’ or something higher, which is part of one’s aspiration. Here Nuit continues the exegesis of Her formula from the previous verse. Remember also that Nuit’s division of number gives us 0.12 and 210, which is significant both in this commentary and in the context of Liber 805. Love is manifold. It could be the tender love of verse twenty-six, or the more stern form of love of verse twenty-two. These are both aspects of Her division. It is in the ‘back of the head’, the cerebellum from which our high mind springs, and the subconscious where this division is first realized. This Path, the Moon, is where the complexities of our psyche really start to rise up, at times quite agonizing. It is the experience of separateness- from the universe Itself as well as from our own True Self. The subconscious is the womb of the Higher Self, and through this path we reacquaint ourselves with those unknown aspects of our psyche. The ego is necessarily so isolated from such a great amount of what constitutes inner and outer- so called- reality. Without this, there would be no hero’s journey. All the wonderment, joy,"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"melancholy, pain and ecstasy would never be, and life would be life-less, monotone and dross, as was the Christist Eden. Pisces represents the nature of the Moon Atu. The zodiacal symbol of Pisces is the Fish, which connects this card and verse to Death and verse twenty-four, Nun=fish. Pisces is the last sign of the zodiac, culminating with the vernal equinox and the beginning of the Thelemic holy season, March 20. The moon partakes of the higher and the lower; it receives the light of the sun, transmitting it to the earth during the hours of darkness. 30. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all. Hebrew Resh and the English W, both value (200). Here we have the Sun Atu, which is Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Hoor-pa-kraat. These are the dual aspects of the solar deity of the Thelemic pantheon and represent, albeit simplistically, the twin current of this aeon of manifestation- activity and passivity or, more accurately, attack and defense. The former is the embodiment of “the pain of division”, the latter “the joy of dissolution”. The two phrases also describe perfectly the active initiation (Magick) and the passive initiation (Yoga). This path connects Hod with Yesod; the Inquiring mind illuminating the subconscious; the spiritual light becoming structured into a formula coherent and given to the sphere of generation, for its ultimate manifestation. This is the creation of the world- the ‘little world’ of AL I;53, which is Earth (man and woman of Earth) and the greater world of the Solar System. With this, division is absolutely necessary, as I have said before in these comments, because with this division, both micro and macro-cosmic, is born the necessary opportunity for Union. This is the Will of Nuit (and Hadit) symbolized by (3) and (0)- Binah, Daleth and the Ain Soph. In Daleth (verse thirteen) we have the unity resulting from Love. Verse twelve is also suggested hereby. The study of these verses will give further understanding of the nature of division. The Sun Atu also relates to the formula of the Rose Cross. Crowley writes in The Book of Thoth that this card describes the Sun as the expansion of the Cross. The pain that was once associated with the Cross is now seen as the ecstatic union of the Solar Consciousness with the Earthy Consciousness. The English W suggests also the Hebrew Shin, which is both Fire and Spirit. Shin is the essential nature of the New Aeon, as we will see in the next verse. 31. For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! They feel little; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones. Hebrew Shin and the English B both have a value of (300) and the Aeon Atu. If we, just for a moment, consider the Sounds of the letters, the English B is Beth, the Magus Atu. Based on my comments to verse 2 of this chapter, the connection here seems to reveal the nature of the initiation of humankind, as does this verse. Here Nuit is giving us another clue to Initiation in this new Aeon, where Ra-Hoor-Khuit rules over the processes. He is the Lord of Force and Fire, the active/positive side of the Thelemic Current. This is a basic Law of the Strong, which is described throughout Liber AL. The path of the Aeon connects Malkuth with Hod, and this is interesting considering this verse. The verse is an appeal to our intellect in its function as regulator of the emotions. We are instructed to keep our emotions in check, ie. caring not at all for the weak. (This relates to the Vice of Compassion, which is another topic altogether). "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The number of the verse (31) is the Key to Liber AL which brings further significance to this verse and the associated Trump. 32. Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! Then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all I can give, by all I desire of ye all. The Hebrew Tau and the English K, both with a value of (400), the Universe Atu, the final Trump and perhaps the final elaboration of Nuit’s manifestation in this series of letters. It is the (2) in the 0=2 formula, which encapsulates the philosophy of Liber AL. Saturn is here, as the ruler of Time; old and slow yet powerful, he is feared and obeyed. Time is of the Essence, they say. Saturn is also of the nature of Binah, as Time is the giver and taker of life. The number of the verse, thirty-two, is Three and Two, Binah and Chokmah. These are the Mother and Father, or Queen and King of the Tetragrammaton and the original Water and Fire elements, responsible for the birth of the Universe- the manifestation of Nuit- as the union of Fire and Water gives us Air, the Fool, and the Prince of the Tetragrammaton. The Fool is of course the first appearance of “I”- as I commented in verse eleven- and the original division as described by Nuit. Remember also that Kether is associated with verse one of Liber AL. Verse One is the quintessential division as verse eleven is the elaboration thereupon. This is the plane of Yetzirah, which is the Ruach in our little universes. (Another personal validation as I read Crowley’s notes on the Universe Atu, given in The Book of Thoth: “The first and foremost characteristic of this card is that it comes at the end of all, and is therefore the complement of the Fool. It is attributed to the letter Tau. The two cards together accordingly spell the word Ath, which means Essence.” As the thirty-second path is Saturn as well as Earth, it is appropriate that Nuit should give us instruction that seems to summarize what has come before. She swears by the vault of her body, which she described as her heart and tongue. All the verses preceding this are the word of Nuit. There are many descriptions pertaining to the ‘vault’ of Her body. She is instructing us to adhere to the practical application of Her manifestation. We are took seek the Universe, both Zero and Two, in the ultimate Samadhi. Only then can we experience Reality as both Nuit and Hadit would ‘see’ it. The infinite expansion and infinite contraction are functions of the twin god Heru-ra-ha, which rules over our Aeon and who guides us in our striving to repose in the bosom of the Great Mother of the Stars.
