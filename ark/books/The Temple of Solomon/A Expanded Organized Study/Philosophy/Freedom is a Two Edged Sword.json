[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Freedom is a Two-edged SwordJack Parsons (Frater Belarion)Author's preface:Since I first wrote this essay in 1946, some of the more ominous predictions have beenfulfilled. Public employees have been subjected to the indignity of \"loyalty\" oaths and theignominy of loyalty purges. Members of the United States Senate, moving under thecloak of immunity and the excuse of emergency, have made a joke of justice and amockery of privacy. Constitutional immunity and legal procedure have been consistentlyviolated and that which once would have been an outrage in America is today refusedeven a review by the Supreme Court.The golden voice of social security, of socialized \"this\" and socialized \"that\", with itsattendant confiscatory taxation and intrusion on individual liberty, is everywhere raisedand everywhere heeded. England has crept under the aegis of a regime synonymous withtotal regimentation. Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia have fallen victims to communism while the United States makes deals with the corrupt dictatorships ofArgentina and Spain.As I write, the United States Senate is pursuing a burlesque investigation into the sphereof private sexual morals, which will accomplish nothing except to bring pain and sorrowto many innocent persons.The inertia and acquiescence which allows the suspension of our liberties would oncehave been unthinkable. The present ignorance and indifference is appalling. The littlethat is worthwhile in our civilization and culture is made possible by the few who arecapable of creative thinking and independent action, grudgingly assisted by the rest.When the majority of men surrender their freedom, barbarism is near but when thecreative minority surrender it, the Dark Age has arrived. Even the word liberalism hasnow become a front for a new social form of Christian morality. Science, that was goingto save the world back in H.G. Wells' time, is regimented, strait-jacketed and scared; itsuniversal language is diminished to one word, security.In this 1950 view some of my more hopeful utterances may appear almost naive.However, I was never so naive as to believe that freedom in any full sense of the word ispossible for more than a few. But I have believed and do still hold that these few, by self-sacrifice, wisdom, courage and continuous effort, can achieve and maintain a free world.The labor is heroic but it can be done by example and by education. Such was the faiththat built America, a faith that America has surrendered. I call upon America to renewthis faith before she perishes.We are one nation but we are also one world. The soul of the slums looks out of the eyesof Wall Street and the fate of a Chinese coolie determines the destiny of America. Wecannot suppress our brother's liberty without suppressing our own and we cannot murderour brothers without murdering ourselves. We stand together as men for human freedomand human dignity or we will fall together, as animals, back into the jungle.In this very late hour it is with solutions that we must be primarily concerned. We seemto be living in a nation that simply does not know what we are told we have and that we"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"tell each other we have. Indeed, it is far more than that. It is to the definition offreedom, to its understanding, in order that it may be attained and defended, that thisessay is devoted. I need not add that freedom is dangerous -- but it is hardly possiblethat we are all cowards.Chapter 1For numberless centuries society accepted the proposition that certain men were createdto be slaves. Their natural function was to serve priests, kings and nobles, men ofsubstance and property who were appointed slave-masters by almighty God. This systemwas reinforced by the established doctrine that all men and women were owned 'in mind'by the church and 'in body' by the state. This convenient situation was supported by theauthority of social morality, religion and even philosophy.Against this doctrine, some two hundred years ago, rose the most astonishing heresy theworld has yet seen; the principle of liberalism. In essence this principle stated that allmen are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights which belong to every man ashis birthright. This idea appealed to certain intractable spirits -- heretics, atheists andrevolutionaries -- and has since made some headway in spite of the opposition of themajority of organized society. As a slogan, however, it has become so popular that it isrendered unwilling lip-service by all the major states and yet it is still so distasteful topersons in authority that it is nowhere embodied as a fundamental law and is continuallyviolated in letter and in spirit by every trick of bigotry and reaction. Further, absolutistand totalitarian groups of the most vicious nature use liberalism as a cloak under whichthey move to re-establish tyrannies and to extinguish the liberty of all who oppose them.Thus religious groups seek to abrogate freedom of art, speech and the press;reactionaries move to suppress labor, communists to establish dictatorships -- and all inthe name of 'freedom'. Because of the peculiar definitions of freedom used by some ofthese camouflaged tyrants, it seems necessary to redefine Freedom in the termsunderstood by Voltaire, Paine, Washington, Jefferson and Emerson.Freedom is a two-edged sword of which one edge is liberty and the other, responsibility.Both edges are exceedingly sharp and the weapon is not suited to casual, cowardly ortreacherous hands.Since all tyrannies are based on dogma and since all dogmas are based on lies, itbehooves us to look beyond them for truth and freedom will both be far away. And yetthe Truth is that we know nothing...Objectively, we know nothing at all. Any system of intellectual thought, whether it bescience, logic, religion or philosophy, is based on certain fundamental ideas or axiomswhich are assumed but which cannot be proven. This is the grave of all positivism. Weassume but we do not know that there is a real and objective world outside our ownmind. Ultimately we do not know what we are or what the world is. Further, if there is areal world apart from ourselves we cannot know what it really is; all we know is what weperceive it to be. All that we perceive is conveyed by our senses and interpreted by ourbrain. However fine, exact or delicate our scientific instruments may be, their data is stillfiltered through our senses and interpreted by our brain. However useful, spectacular or"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"necessary our ideas and experiments may be, they still have little to do with absolutetruth. Such a thing can only exist for the individual according to his whim or his innerperception of his own truth-in-being.The witches and devils of the middle ages were real by our own standards; reputable andresponsible persons believed in them. They were seen, their effects observed and theyaccounted for a large body of otherwise inexplicable phenomenon. Their existence wasaccepted without question by the majority of men, great and humble. From this majoritythere was not and still is not any appeal. Yet we do not believe in these things today. Webelieve in other things similarly explaining the same phenomenon. Tomorrow we willbelieve in still other things We believe but we do not know.All of our deductions, for example the theory of gravitation, are based on observedstatistics, on tendencies observed to occur in a certain way. Even if our observations arecorrect, we still do not know why these things happen. Our theories are onlyassumptions, however reasonable they may seem.There is a type of truth that is based on experience: we know that we feel hot or hungryor in love. These feelings cannot be conveyed to anyone who has not experienced them.We can describe them in terms of similar feelings experienced by someone else,analyzing their cause-and-effect according to mutually acceptable theories but thatsomeone else will never really know what your feeling is like.The above may be negative considerations but within their limits we can deduce positiveprinciples:1. Whatever the universe is, we are either all or part of it by virtue of our consciousnessbut we do not know which.2. No philosophy, scientific theory, religion or system of thought can be absolute andinfallible. They are relative only. One man's opinion is just as good as another's.3. There is no absolute justification for emphasizing one individual theory or way of lifeover another.4. Every man has the right to his own opinion and his own way of life. There is no systemof human thought which can successfully refute this thesis.So much for positivism but other problems still remain. There is necessity, expediencyand convenience. If these are illusions they are very popular and it is usual to considerthem. We might say that politics is concerned with necessity and expediency whereasscience is concerned with convenience. This is not intended to discredit science andreason in their proper spheres. Reason is one of our greatest gifts, the power thatdifferentiates us from the animals, and science is our greatest tool, our best hope forbuilding a genuine civilization. (It is curious that this modern truism appears, in thissystem of reasoning, as a concession.)In spite of its inestimable value, science is a tool and has nothing to do with ultimatetruth. Herein is the danger of science. As a tool it is so valuable, so useful and soirresistible that we incline to regard it as the arbiter of the absolute, giving final andirrefutable pronouncement on all things. This is exactly the position that the pedant, thedogmatist and the dialectical materialist would have us take. Then, posing as a \"scientist\"or propounding \"Scientific\" doctrines, he can persuade us to accept his values and obeyhis orders. Today's science must forever be free to overthrow its yesterdays, otherwise itwill degenerate into ancestor worship."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It is necessary that we defend freedom unless we all wish to be slaves. It is expedientthat we achieve brotherhood unless we desire destruction and it is convenient that wegrant others the right to their own opinions and life-styles in order to maintain our own.The intelligent individual will not base his conduct on an arbitrary or absolute concept ofright and wrong. It may be argued that all motives and all actions are selfish since theyare intended to satisfy some requirement of the ego. Perhaps this is true of self-sacrifice,abnegation and the highest altruism. We engage in them in order to satisfy ourselves byattaining some object however intangible it may be.The ego can be very broad. A man may include the whole world as a part of his ego andthus set out to redeem or save it for no other reason than the pleasure of personalaccomplishment. Such a man, far from being unselfish, is extremely egotistical. Theartist devoted to the production of pure beauty is so dedicated because of his need andhis nature; at least such egotism is not petty. Motives of family-love and patriotism arerooted in bigotry. This does not necessarily detract from such actions and motives.Everything in nature is beautiful and it is no less beautiful because it is understood.However, the unenlightened man will assign arbitrary values to all things in order toprotect and justify his own position. His morals are based on things he wishes were trueor which someone else wishes were true. His philosophy pays no attention to relativefacts or realities and yet in his life he must deal with them. He is consequently involvedin a constant round of pretenses and evasions.The enlightened liberal needs no such justification. He will realize and accept his inherentselfishness and the inherent selfishness of all men. He will understand living as atechnique, the technique of getting what he wants on the terms he wants.Such is the case with freedom. If we abrogate another's freedom to gain our own ends,our own freedom is thereby jeopardized. That is the cost. If we wish to assure our ownfreedom, we must assure all mens' freedom. That is the technique.If a liberal were to develop two personalities and one of these personalities were toestablish a benevolent dictatorship while the other continued his liberal activities it wouldonly be a matter of time before he killed himself. The restriction of others freedom isultimately self-enslavement and suicide. The dictator is the most abject of all slaves.These simple considerations are the logical basis of the philosophy of liberalism. Fromsuch considerations and from many more the fundamental principles of liberalism aroseas a code of rights, basic in nature and clear beyond misconception. This code must bethe Law beyond the law, an ultimate expression of the dignity and inviolability of theindividual. It must be above compromise by courts and lawyers, beyond the whim of thepopulace and the treachery of demagogues. It must be the epitome of man's aspertiontoward liberty and self-determination, a canon so sacred that its violation by a state, agroup or an individual is treason and sacrilege. The Bill of Rights in the AmericanConstitution was a step in the right direction and its study will indicate furtherdevelopment. In a world so threatened by positivism and paternalism this doctrine islimited in both scope and application. It permits such violations of liberty as the lateNational Prohibition Act, the Draft Law, the closed shop, the Mann Act, censorship laws,anti-firearms laws and racial discrimination.It has been said, with justification, that the Constitution means what the Supreme Courtsays it means. A document so fundamental as a Bill of Rights cannot be jeopardized by"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"arbitrary interpretations. It should need no interpretations. It must apply equally to thenational state, the federated states, counties, municipalities, official agencies and theprivate citizen within their province. It must apply in such a way that the individual orminority needs no recourse to elaborate, lengthy and costly proceedings in order toprotect these rights. It is the duty of the state to provide this recourse to all alike.Freedom cannot be subject to arbitrary interpretation and misinterpretation. It mustplainly include freedom from persecution on moral, political, economic, racial, social orreligious grounds. No man, no group and no nation has the right to any man's individualfreedom. No matter how pure the motive, how great the emergency, how high theprinciple, such action is tyranny and is never justified.The question is, are we able to face the consequences of democracy? It is not sufficientthat freedom be assured by purely negative means. Freedom is meaningless where itsexpression is controlled by powerful groups such as the press, the radio, the motionpicture industry, churches, politicians and capitalists. Freedom must be insured.It can only be insured by the allegiance to the principle that man has certain inalienablerights; among which are the rights:•To live his private life, insofar as it concerns only himself, as he sees fit.•To eat and drink, to dress, live and travel as, where and he will.•To express himself; to speak, write, print, experiment and otherwise create ashe desires.•To work as he chooses, when he chooses and where he chooses at areasonable and commensurate wage.•To purchase his food, shelter, deical and social needs and all other services andcommodities necessary to his existence and self expression at a reasonable andcommensurate price.•To have a decent environment and upbringing during his childhood until hereaches a responsible majority.•To love as he desires, where, how and with whom he chooses, in accordanceonly with the desires of himself and of his partner.•To the positive opportunity to enjoy these rights as he sees fit, withoutobstruction on the one hand or compulsion on the other.•Finally, in order to protect his person, his property and his rights, he shouldhave the right to kill an aggressor if necessary. This is the purpose of the rightto keep and bear arms.These rights must be counterbalanced by certain responsibilities. The liberal acceptingthem must guarantee these rights to all others at all times, regardless of his personalfeelings or interests. He must work to establish and protect them, live in a manner"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"commensurate with them and be prepared to defend them with his life. He must refuseallegiance to any state or organization which denies these rights and he should aid andencourage all who, without qualification or equivocation, endorse them. He must refuseto compromise these principles on any issue or for any reason. Nothing short of such acommitment will assure the survival of liberty, or democracy of society itself. Liberalismis not only a code for individuals and their state, it is the only possible basis for a futureinternational civilization. However, these principles will be only rhetoric unless they arerevered and protected by those to whom they apply. They must be interpreted andapplied with understanding and sympathy, with humor and tolerance. Pretentiousness,sentimentality or hysterics are not needed in their application or their defense.Insufferable demagogues of \"high principle\" are sufficiently numerous as it is.It must also be understood that we cannot force man's rights upon him. Man has a rightto be a slave if he so desires. If he does not assert and defend his rights he deservesslavery. The person who is tyrannized by his family, his peers, by public opinion or slavemorality, providing he is free to leave their influence or to challenge it, is worthy of hiscondition. His protestations are those of the hypocrite.Freedom, like charity, begins at home. No man is worthy to fight in the cause of freedomunless he has conquered his internal drives. He must learn to control and discipline thedisastrous passions that would lead him to folly and ruin. He must conquer inordinatevanity and anger, self deception, fear and inhibition. These are the crude ores of hisbeing.He must smelt these ores in the fire of life; forge his own sword, temper it and sharpen itagainst the hard abrasive of experience. Only then is he fit to bear arms in the largerbattle. There is no substitute for courage and the victory is to the high hearted. He willhave nothing to do with asceticism or the excesses of weakness. Self expression will behis watchword, a self expression tempered keen and strong. First he must know how torule himself. Only then can he cope with the economic pressures which are employed byinstitutions and corporations or the political pressures employed by demagogues.He may then find himself in a difficult predicament. If he calls himself a liberal, hediscovers that he is supposedly committed to a policy of accommodation with the RussianGovernment. If he opposes a pro-Soviet policy he is welcome to the camp of the CatholicChurch and the Manufacturer's Association. If he eschews both camps, he is condemnedfor lack of principle. If he should support the rights of the workingman or minority andracial groups, he is a Red. If at the same time he believes in Constitutional Governmentand individual rights, he is also a Fascist.Many liberals are familiar with this situation but few seem to have deduced theconclusion. The difficulty lies in the confusion of the rights of the individual in relation tothe responsibilities of the state. It is a sad comment on our mentality that the socialreformer subscribes to total regimentation while the alleged individualist propagandizesfor total irresponsibility. The rights of the individual can be clearly defined. Hisresponsibilities vis-a-vis the responsibilities of the state can be clearly defined. Theindividual's rights end where the next man's begin. It is the function of the state toensure equal rights to all. But, in the absence of a social devotion to the true principles ofliberalism, positivists have usurped its name and even its phrases in order topropagandize for their various totalitarianisms. This process has been aided by that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"faction of pseudo-liberalism which believes that all opinion contrary to its own must besuppressed.As I write, allegedly liberal groups are agitating for the denial of public forums to thosethey call fascist. Americanism societies are striving for the suppression of communist or\"red\" literature and speech. Religious groups, backed by a publicity conscious press, areconstantly campaigning for the prohibition of art and literature which, as if by divineprerogative, they term \"indecent\", immoral or dangerous.It would seem that all these organizations are devoted to one common purpose, thesuppression of freedom. Their sincerity is no excuse. History is a bloody testament thatsincerity can achieve atrocities which cynicism could hardly conceive of. Each of thesegroups is engaged in a frantic struggle to sell out, betray or destroy the freedom whichwas their birthright and which alone assured their present existence.Freedom is a two-edged sword. He who believes that the absolute rightness of his beliefis an authority to suppress the rights and opinions of his fellows cannot be a liberal.Liberalism cannot exist where it violates its own principles. It cannot exist where theemergency monger or the utopia salesman can obtain a suspension of rights, whethertemporary or permanent. Liberty cannot be suppressed in order to defend liberalism.If we are to achieve a democracy, the rights of individuals and the responsibilities ofstates must be openly defined and ardently defended. It is inconceivable that men whofought and died in a war against totalitarianism did not know what they fought for. Itseems a fantastic joke that the institutions they believed in and defended have turned,like a nightmare, into home-grown tyrannies. A generation went down in blood andagony to make the world \"safe\" but the evil that makes the world \"unsafe\" still goesundefeated, plotting new sacrifices of misery and blood. The guilt lies not entirely withthe warmongers, plutocrats and demagogues. If a people permit exploitation andregimentation in any name, they deserve their slavery. A tyrant does not make histyranny. It is made possible by his people and not otherwise.Much of our modern thought is characterized by pretenses and evasions, by appeals toultimate authorities which are non- liberal, superstitious and reactionary. Often we arenot aware of these thought processes. We accept ideas, authorities, catch- phrases andconditions without troubling to think or investigate and yet these things may concealterrible traps. We accept them as right because they have a surface-level agreement withthe things in which we believe. We welcome the man who is for liberalism, againstcommunism, without troubling to inquire what else he is for or against. In our blindnesswe leave ourselves open to exploitation, regimentation and war.Tumultuous developments in science and society demand a new clarity of thought, areexamination and a restatement of principles. It is not sufficient that a principle issacred because it is time-worn. It must be examined, tried and tested in the crucible ofour present needs.In our law, in our social and international relations, we are guilty of a myriad ofbarbarisms and superstitions. These injustices continue and proliferate because we havebecome used to them. We have lost our freedom through tolerance and inertia.The principle we have developed herein is simple: the liberty of the individual is thefoundation of civilization. No true civilization is possible without this liberty and no state,national or international, is stable in its absence. The proper relation between individual"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"liberty on the one hand and social responsibility on the other is the balance which willassure a stable society. The only other road to social equilibrium demands the totalannihilation of individuality. There is not further evasion of nature's immemorialultimatum: change or perish but the choice of change is ours.Chapter TwoOf all the strange and terrible powers among which we move unknowingly, sex is themost potent. Conceived in the orgasm of birth, we burst forth in agony and ecstasy fromthe Center of Creation. Time and again we return to that fountain, lose ourselves in thefires of being, unite for a moment with the eternal force and return renewed andrefreshed as from a miraculous sacrament. Then, at the last, our life closes in the orgasmof death.Sex, typified as love, is at the heart of every mystery, at the center of every secret. It isthis splendid and subtle serpent that wines about the cross and coils in the bloom of themystic rose.The sexual perversion of Christianity becomes obvious when it is realized that \"The HolyGhost\" (The Sophia) is feminine. The very Tetragrammaton, Yod He Vau He, means:Father-Mother-Son- Daughter and asserts the splendor of the biological order. How couldlife proceed from a strictly masculine creation? What miracle could possibly be superior tothe miracle of copulation, conception and gestation? In the corrupt and demonic Jehova,the priesthood blasphemed nature in order to perpetuate a tyrannical and superstitiouspatriarchy. Woman was insulted and affronted with the calumny of immaculateconception -- then, by this mystery mongering, a premium was placed on moral andspiritual sterility. This sublimation of the sex-urge has been the basis of the power of thechurch and is the source of much of the psychosis rampant in the modern world.It has been asserted that the church has been a champion of progress and freedom;nothing could be more fallacious. Organized Christianity has been inevitably allied withtyranny, reaction and persecution. No organized dogma can contribute to progressexcept by occasional accident. The church's main contribution has been to unintentionallyfoment revolt against its bigotry. It could hardly be otherwise with an organizationfounded on a double fallacy: the sin of sex and the infallibility of man. No religion canhope to benefit humanity while it preaches love and reviles the root of love. Anyonehoping to understand and cope with human relations must understand both theimportance and over-emphasis of sex in society.Sexual concepts and symbolism underlie all the world's religions. As I mentioned above,sublimated sex has been the source of power for the Christian church. Sex and sexneurosis are fundamental factors in the attitude of modern men. These three facts givesex a place of prime importance in our liberal examination of society.Our sex attitudes are largely characterized by pretense. The majority of people underfifty today have, at one time or another, engaged in what is termed illicit intercourse --and yet we pretend, publicly, that we have not done so. Some of us go so far as to statethat we don't do it, never would do it and disapprove of the criminal types who do.Policemen arrest and judges convict persons discovered in a pursuit which theythemselves indulge in. The enjoyment of a natural urge is defined as a crime. Youngpersons thus enjoying the urge in the wonder of the beginning are burdened with a senseof guilt and shame. They are classed with common criminals -- why?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The shameful answer is that back in the Middle Ages, under conditions of squalor,ignorance, superstition and oppression, the sex taboo became a prime instrument ofpower in the arsenal of a band of brigands known as the Christian church. This is thereason that young people in love are classified as criminals. Venereal disease thrives andabortionists prosper as an inevitable result. The superstition which fostered this shamefulcondition is no longer absolutely dominant but the institution that promoted the beliefthat the human body was obscene, that love was indecent and that woman was forevermade foul by original sin remains to mold our thoughts and shape our laws. It is mostsignificant that the spiritual and physical inheritors of that church, both catholic andprotestant, vigorously and effectively oppose birth control, venereal disease education,divorce law reform; i.e., anything which would limit the power of their weapon.If the Christians enforced these taboos only among their believers they would be withintheir rights. Man has the right to any personal stupidity however monstrous it may seembut this is not their principal concern. They seek to impose this nonsense on everybody,by every method of legislative, moral and economic intimidation at their command. Thesuccess of their efforts can be judged by the reflection of such attitudes in the press, theradio, the motion picture industry and our legal statutes. True to fascist form, the censorutilizes his moral victory to impose political and social censorship in all fields. Bigots andemagogues invoke the divine right of religion and of morality in order to gainextraordinary power. Freedom of religion and of he press should not afford a justificationfor giant propaganda campaigns to suppress freedom! We must not only have freedom ofreligion, we must have freedom from religion.The concept that sex in art, literature and life is subject to criminal law is based entirelyon this superstitious sexual taboo. The censorial power of the church, the state andestablished press is founded solely on this one assumption: that the taboo of a particularreligion should have universal legal sanction. This sanction, once established, is thensubtly extended to imply that all the other dogmas of that religion are now the \"unwrittenlaw\" of the land. Such a religion, always respectable and conservative, forms allianceswith fascist and capitalist cliques, thus gaining a privileged position from which topersecute liberalism in all its forms. Superstition, taboo, reaction and fascism augmentone another most effectively. The fact that one type of totalitarianism persecutes another-- or appears to do so -- is hardly a palliative.Modern man must recognize the source and nature of his sexual taboos and discreditthem in the light of truth. Only thus can he achieve sanity in sex and a healthy outlookon life in general.In our society early marriages are often prevented by economic considerations, thereforepre-marital sexual relations are natural and often desirable. Contraceptive techniques,available to any intelligent young person from a druggist or doctor, can minimize theproblem of venereal disease and unwanted pregnancies. The development of sexualtechnique, the determination of the qualifications of one's partner and the gratification ofthe youthful urge to experiment all assure a far more lasting and stable marriage thanone begun in ignorance and prudery. In marriage itself the social contract is biding.Property acquired by the joint efforts of husband and wife belong to both jointly. Whereany two persons have pledged their love together, no outsider has the right to interfere.Either party is justified in resisting such interference by force if necessary. But neither"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"party, whether the relation be in or out of wedlock, has any right or jurisdiction over thelove, affection or the sexual favors of another for longer than that person desires.Where children are concerned a separation presents a serious problem. Broken homesare hard on children but a loveless and bitter home is worse. No state can assure a childthe affection of his parents but it can guarantee his physical welfare and security, thusinsuring him against many of the frustrations of childhood and adolescence whichdevelop into unstable and maladjusted adult behavior. The laws against mutuallyagreeable sex expression must be repealed, together with the laws prohibiting nudism,birth control and censorship. We must emphatically deny that love is criminal and thatthe body is indecent. We must affirm the beauty, the dignity, and joyousness and eventhe humor of sex.Indeed there are obscene things in the light and in the darkness; things that deservedestruction: -- The exploitation of women for poor wages, the shameful degradation ofminorities by the little lice who call themselves members of a 'superior race' and thedeliberate machinations towards war. Nowhere among these genuine obscenities is therea place for the love shared by men and women. There are sins but love is not one ofthem and yet, of all the things that have been called sins, love has been the mostpunished and the most persecuted. Of all the beauties we know, the springtime of love isclosest to paradise. And as all things pass, so love passes -- too soon. This mostexquisite and tender of human emotions, this little moment of eternity, should be freeand unrestrained. It should not be bought and sold, chained and restricted until lovers,caught in the maelstrom of economics and laws, are hounded like criminals. What end isserved and who profits by such cruelty? Only priests and lawyers. Let us adhere to astrict morality where the rights and happiness of our fellow man is concerned. Let us callour true sins by their right names and expiate them accordingly -- but let our lovers gofree.If we are to achieve civilization and sanity, we must institute an educational program inlove-making, birth control and disease prevention. Above all we must root out thebarbaric and vicious concepts of shamefulness and indecency in sex, exposing themotives and methods of their proponents.Happy are the parents who, as a result of sexual experimenting, are well mated, takingjoy in each other's passion, seeing beauty in their nakedness and not fearing to exposetheir bodies or the bodies of their children. They would never shame their children fortheir natural sexual curiosity.Jesus told the \"fallen woman\", \"Go and sin no more\" but I, who am a man, say to youwho have given your body for the need of man's body, who have given your love freelyfor his spirit's sake; \"Be blessed in the name of man. And if any god deny you for this, Iwill deny that god.\"The ancients, being simple and without original sin, saw God in the act of love andtherein they saw a great mystery, a sacrament revealing the bounty and the beauty ofthe force that made men and the stars. Thus they worshipped. Poor ignorant old Pagans!How we have progressed. What was most sacred to them, we see as a dirty joke. Fromthis sordid joke we have played on ourselves only Woman Herself can redeem us. Shehas been the ignominious butt of the joke, the target of malice and arrogance and thescapegoat for masculine inferiority and guilt. She alone can redeem us from ourcrucifixion and castration. Only woman, of and by herself, can strike through the foolish"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"frustration of the advertisers' ideal. She must elevate her strong, free and splendid imageto take her place in the sun as an individual, a companion and mate fit for, anddemanding no less than, true men.Let there be an end to inhibition and an end to pretense. Let us discover what we are andbe what we are, honestly and unashamedly. The rabbit has speed to recompense hisfear, the panther strength to assuage his hunger. There is room for both even though therabbit would probably prefer a world of rabbits (dull and overpopulated). All traits areuseful wrath, fear, lust and even laziness -- if they are balanced by strength andintelligence. If we lie about things we call our weaknesses and sins, if we say that his is\"evil\" and that is \"wrong\", denying that such faults could be part of us, they will growcrooked in the dark. But when we have them out in the open; admitting them, facingthem and accepting them, then we will be ashamed to leave any vestige of them secretto turn crippled and twisted. Fear can sharpen our wits against adversity. Anger andstrength can be welded into a sword against tyrants both within and without. Lust can betrained to be the strong and subtle servant of love and art.It is not necessary to deny anything. It is only necessary to know ourselves. Then we willnaturally seek that which is needful to our being. Our significance does not lie in theextent to which we resemble others or in the extent to which we differ from them. It lieswithin our ability to be ourselves. This may well be the entire object of life; to discoverourselves, our meaning. This does not come in a sudden burst of illumination; it is aconstant process which continues so long as we are truly alive. The process cannotcontinue unobstructed unless we are free to undergo all experience and willing toparticipate in all existence. Then the significant questions are not \"is it right\" or \"is itgood\" but rather \"how does it feel\" and \"what does it mean\". Ultimately these are theonly questions that can approach truth but they cannot be asked in the absence offreedom."}]
