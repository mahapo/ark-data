Gematria was most famously employed by the Cabbalists—Jewish Mystics of the Middle Ages and Renaissance—using the Hebrew Bible to mystically relate Hebrew words to each other (such as the names of God) by their numerical equivalence. The Greeks also used gematria along similar lines.I have spent many decades searching for a way of doing ‘musical gematria’. I have always found gematria intriguing; especially since I’ve taught mathematics at the college level, and I have an abiding interest in Biblical languages (I did my own translation of the New Testament from the original Greek into English). Being a musician since age 5 (and that has been my primary career for over three decades now) I have been intrigued with the idea of extending gematria—of word/number—to music. After all, music already has a profoundly mathematical and mystical character.The vague idea of ‘musical gematria’ is one thing, realizing that in a concrete method of actually doing it is quite another. Every method of doing ‘musical gematria’ that I have tried over the years resulted in ugly musical chaos—that is (as I liked to put it): ‘tone rows’ à la Schoenberg and company. Ugh!1(Some of my earlier attempts at ‘Musical Gematria’ can be found in my Music of the Spheres album (2003), in which primitive ideas of Musical Gematria found limited use in generating rhythmic, not melodic nor harmonic, ideas.)Meanwhile, it has always seemed to me that one of the inviolable criteria of a true Musical Gematria is that it results in musical gestures that are graceful. After all, according to Plato (and many others since him), one of our ‘primary values’ is Beauty (the other two being Truth and Goodness (ethics).) Furthermore, it has always seemed to me that another criterion of a true/beautiful/good musical gematria is that the method of doing it be fundamentally simple and ‘elegant’.Imagine my surprise when, after over a decade of trying idea after idea that only resulted in the dreaded ‘tone rows’, I awoke one morning in November 2011 knowing how to do it. And not just one method—a whole family of approaches.To explain musical gematria I have to explain gematria itself—which necessitates reviewing how the ancient Greeks and Hebrews expressed numbers. And it requires me to review some basic mathematics to which you were almost certainly exposed in grade school, but you have long forgotten because it has no general practical application. And it requires using the barest rudiments of musical notation. The historical surveys are highly superfi cial, to say the least—just enough to present the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"principles of Musical Gematria. Ultimately I am more concerned with coherently introducing these ideas to others who may use and develop them, and less with producing a ‘scholarly work’ per se.

His students were sworn to secrecy, his teachings only shared later by Plato (427–347 B.C.E.)2 and others, so it is impossible at this point to know which ideas were Pythagoras’ and those of his school.That being said, the Pythagorean School taught that number was the basis of everything:“The eternal being of [N]umber is a most provident principle of the whole heaven, earth, and of the intermediate nature; moreover it is a source of permance for divine (men) and gods and daemons.”3“All things are like unto [N]umber.”4“Nothing whatever can be thought or known without Number.”5Because Number represents a celestial power working in the divine sphere, it is really a blueprint of creation. Number is itself divine and associated with the divinities.Pythagorean ideas became an important thread in subsequent Greek philosophy.HarmonyThe Pythagorean School is credited with discovering the mathematical nature of harmonious musical note combinations. These ideas are most easily illustrated with a ‘monochord’ (a favorite tool of the Pythagoreans)—which is something like a one-stringed guitar:‘Monochord’ means ‘one string’—you pluck the one string and get the one note. The two ‘fi xed bridges’—one on each end—determine the length of the vibrating string, which determine the pitch.6 One note alone is hardly useful, so the monochord really comes into its own by adding one more bridge, a ‘moveable bridge’, which divides our single string into two parts:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"4Musical GematriaThe ‘moveable bridge’ divides our string into two playable segments. If we pluck the string segment on the left of the moveable bridge, we’ll get one pitch; if we pluck the string segment on the right, we’ll get another (unless we place the moveable bridge exactly in the middle, in which case both string segments will sound the same pitch.)We can put the moveable bridge anywhere we want. But suppose we put it at arithmetically special/simple positions:In this example, the string length on the left has a length of 2 relative to the string length on the right of 3. (It doesn’t matter if we’re using inches, centimeters, furlongs or light-years—the essential thing is the ratio of the two string lengths.) In this example, if we pluck the string segment on the left and then the string segment on the right, we will hear the pitches DO to SO—that is, DO [re me fa] SO. If you count DO=1, RE=2, MI=3, FA=4, SO=5, then ‘SO’ is the fi fth step of DO-RE-MI..., and is known as the Perfect Fifth, one of the most important pitch combinations in music worldwide. The Pythagoreans showed that harmonious pitch combinations (such as DO to SO) correspond to arithmetically simple string length ratios, such as 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 5, and so forth. (If the two string segments are close to “2 to 3” but not exact, they still sound musically harmonious because the ear is accustomed to imperfection. But diverging too far from simple ratios results in ‘disharmony’ or ‘dissonance’.)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"5William ZeitlerMusic of the SpheresThe Pythagoreans extended this idea of harmony to the planets themselves. In a theory known as the ‘Music of the Spheres’ or ‘Harmony of the Spheres’ Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution. These celestial sounds are physically imperceptible to the human ear—in the same way that someone living next to a waterfall ceases to hear it after a long enough acclimation. Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as “twinned” studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, both of which require knowledge of numerical proportions:As the eyes are framed for astronomy so the ears are framed for harmony: and these are in some form kindred sciences, as the Pythagoreans affi rm and we admit.7The idea of the ‘harmony of the spheres’ was important in Western astrology/astronomy until Kepler (1571-1630). Kepler’s three mathematical laws of planetary motion are the beginnings of modern astrophysics—they are still taught in Physics 101. But, for example, his book “Harmony of the World” in which he introduces one of his famous laws, is a marvelous mixture of mathematical and musical notation.Greek GematriaIn the modern Western world we are accustomed to having one set of characters for writing words (‘A’/’a’ through ‘Z’/’z’), and another set of characters for writing numbers (‘0’ through ‘9’). This has not always been so.The ancient Greeks used the alphabet/number system on the next page.In other words, A–Θ represented 1–9, I–Ϟ represented 10–90, and P–Ϡ represented 100–900.10 Thus, in this system, “ΧΟΗ” (“choē”), which means “a drink offering to the gods,” has a numerical value of:Χ (ch) =600Ο (o)=70+Η (ē)=8Total=678Remember, the Greeks weren’t ‘translating’ their letters into numerals and then adding them. “ΧΟΗ” was how they would write “678”.11Some say the Greeks adopted this system from the Phoenicians.12 Others say that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"6Musical Gematriathe Greeks invented it themselves.13 Either way, you can see that to an ancient Greek the line between numbers and letters/words was very thin indeed.So one shouldn’t be too surprised that the Greeks would use the gematria values of the names of their gods in the construction of their temples. In fact, the word ‘gematria’ itself argues for its use in the geometry of architecture, as the etymology of ‘gematria’ is that it was derived from the Greek word “geometria” (“earth-measures”) from which we also get the word ‘geometry’.14Greek Alphabet TableLetter8AncientNumericalValueLetter NameTransliterationSimpleEnumeration(omitting the archaic letters)Α α1AlphaA1Β β2BetaB2Γ γ3GammaG3Δ δ4DeltaD4Ε ε5EpsilonE5Ϝ ϝ*6Digamma (later Stigma)StΖ ζ7ZetaZ6Η η8EtaĒ7Θ θ9ThetaTh8Ι ι10IotaI9Κ κ20KappaK10Λ λ30LamdaL11Μ μ40MuM12Ν ν50NuN13Ξ ξ60XiX14Ο ο70OmicronO15Π π80PiP16Ϟ ϟ*90KoppaQΡ ρ100RhoR17Σ σ ς200SigmaS18Τ τ300TauT19Υ υ400UpsilonY/U20Φ φ500PhiPh21Χ χ600ChiCh22Ψ ψ700PsiPs23Ω ω800OmegaŌ24Ϡ ϡ*900Sampits?*Archaic9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"7William ZeitlerIn the Parthenon itself (to just name one example), the following dimensions appear—which also happen to be the gematria value of the indicated god15:353‘Hermes’318‘Helios’ (the Sun)612‘Zeus’707‘The God Hermes’(using the ancient Greek ‘foot’ as the unit of measure)By the way, applying gematria to their architecture wasn’t unique to the Greeks: a Babylonian clay table indicates that around 700 BCE, Sargon II ordered that the wall of Khorsabad be constructed to have a length of 16,283 cubits, the numerical value of his name.16Greek gematria all but disappeared from use with the demise of Graeco-Roman culture in general in the Dark Ages."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"8Musical GematriaHebrew GematriaBy around the 1st through 6th centuries C.E., the Hebrews were using an alphabetic numbering similar to that of the Greeks: Hebrew Alphabet TableLetterNumerical ValueLetter NameTransliterationSimpleEnumerationא1AlefA1ב2BetB2ג3GimelG3ד4DaletD4ה5HeH5ו6VavW/V6ז7ZayinZ7ח8HetCh (as in “Bach” and “Loch”)8ט9TetT9י10YodY10ך/כ20KafK11ל30LamedL12ם/מ40MemM13נ/ן50NunN14ס60SamekhS15ע70Ayin-16ף/פ80PeP17ץ/צ90TsadiTs18ק100QofQ19ר200ReshR20ש300Shins/sh21ת400TavT22Hundreds greater than 400 were represented by the sum of two or more letters representing hundreds17.Apparently the Hebrews learned the numerical use of the alphabet from the Greeks.18 Wherever they learned it, it would certainly be true that using this system, the line between a number and a word was very thin to the ancient Hebrews, and it would be easy and natural to view a word as a number and vice versa.19"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"9William ZeitlerHebrew gematria was taken to heart and greatly developed by medieval and renaissance Jewish mystics in a fi eld of study known as ‘Kabbalah’20.English GematriaIn modern English the customary way of relating the counting numbers to the letters of the alphabet is to use ‘simple enumeration’ (number them successively):English Alphabet TableLetterSimple EnumerationA 1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9J10K11L12M13N14O15P16Q17R18S19T20U21V22W23X24Y25Z26"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"10Musical GematriaOther Ancient Numbering SystemsImplicit in the ancient Greek and Hebrew numbering systems is grouping by ten: one set of characters for the numbers 1–9, another for the numbers 10–90, etc.Now, grouping & numbering by tens is entirely natural for us humans, as we have 10 fi ngers to use as digits. In fact, another name for ‘fi nger’ is ‘digit’. But grouping & numbering by tens was certainly not universal. Greenlanders counted by twenties (using both fi ngers and toes), as did the Aztecs, and the Mayans (for the most part). And the ancient Sumerians counted by 60s for astronomical observations (but by tens for everyday use)—we still see the vestiges of that in ’60 minutes to an hour’.And of course there were yet other ways of representing numbers in the ancient world, such as Roman numerals."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"11William ZeitlerNumber BasesImagine the odometer on a car. It starts out at:As you drive it, the right most ‘wheel’ (well, they used to actually be wheels until they were replaced by electronics) advances to 1, then 2, etc. until it gets to 9:Then the rightmost wheel turns to 0, and the wheel just to its left advances 1:As we continue to drive the car, the rightmost wheel will eventually advance to 9 again:When it rolls over to 0 again, the wheel to its immediate left advances again:Eventually both wheels will advance to 9:Driving one more mile (or kilometer) causes the right most wheel to advance from 9 to 0, which means that the wheel to its left must advance by one. But that wheel is at 9 also, so it also advances from 9 to 0, and the wheel to its left advances to 1 as well:This is how we count in the modern West, and it is called a ‘positional’ numbering system, because the quantity represented by a digit is determined by its position. The rightmost wheel always represents how many 1’s. Furthermore, we say this is ‘base 10’, because to fi gure out what the wheel to the immediate left of any wheel represents, you multiply by 10.We could just as easily use odometer wheels that had only eight digits: 0 through 7:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"12Musical Gematriaetc.... etc....etc....The smallest number of digits you can have and still be able to count is 2, and our two and only two digits will be ‘0’ and ‘1’. Counting in base 2 looks like this:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"13William ZeitlerThis may seem like a crazy way to count, but it turns out that base 2 is enormously useful. The very fi rst computers were designed to use base 10 internally, just like their human designers. But this didn’t work—the electronics turned out to be cumbersome and error prone. Then, they decided to use base 2, because a base 2 electronic device is vastly more reliable, and so simple it can be made economically by the millions—and the computer revolution was born.By the way, when writing numbers instead of looking at them on odometers, we leave customarily off all the ‘leading zeros’—‘100’ is a lot easier to read than ‘000100’ and the ‘leading zeros’ don’t tell us anything. Also, contexts where there is any question about which base we are using, we can write a subscript indicating the base after the number:10002 is 1000 base 21248 is 124 base 8To summarize, we have seen that our modern system of notating numbers may be practical, but all sorts of other number notation systems have been used successfully. Furthermore, although base 10 works well for most human applications—and we have a bias towards base 10 because we have 10 fi ngers—there may be situations where some other number base may work better.For example, the number ‘7’ has all sorts of mystical importance. So for certain mystical purposes, it might make more sense to use base 7 than base 10.After all, to limit ourselves to just base 10 is like a painter limiting themselves to just the one color ‘green’.Music & Number BasesConsider the notes of the ‘DO, RE, MI’ scale:(If you don’t know how to read music, here’s all you need to know for this discussion: notice that each circle is centered on a line or space. As you go up “line, space, line, space”, you are going up the “white notes” on the piano keyboard. So DO is on a space, RE is on the next line up, MI is on the next space up, and so on.)From the lower DO to the upper DO is called an ‘octave’—one of the most important note relationships in all music everywhere in the world. It has a basis"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"14Musical Gematriain physics: the upper DO always vibrates at twice the vibrations per second of the lower DO. So if the lower DO is vibrating at, say, 100 vibrations per second, the ‘upper’ DO vibrates at twice that, namely 200 vibrations per second.21 On a monochord, the string lengths would be in a ratio of 1 to 2.As you continue up the scale, the pattern of DO, RE, MI repeats itself:The same pattern holds if you go down the scale (note: when you run out of lines for your “line, space, line, space”, you just draw more short ones):DO RE MI goes up infi nitely (and down infi nitely) making it a great spiral: as you ascend the scale, each DO circles back on itself but at exactly twice the vibration. (Our physical ears, however, are only capable of hearing about 10 octaves or so.)By the way, the same 2 to 1 octave relationship holds not just for DO, but also for the rest of the notes of DO RE MI—if you go from the RE in one octave to the RE in the next octave higher, the higher RE vibrates exactly twice as fast as the lower RE. And so on.The idea that ‘DO’ is still ‘DO’ regardless of the octave in which it occurs is known as ‘octave equivalence’.Suppose we want to number the notes of our scale. We could do something like this:But notice that there are seven notes in DO RE MI before we get to the next DO and the pattern starts repeating itself again. What if we number the notes using base 7, and begin with 0 as in our odometer examples earlier:Notice that in the 1’s place, DO is always 0, RE is always 1, and so on. And the 7’s"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"15William Zeitlerplace tells us how many octaves up we’ve gone. (In the fi rst octave in this example, the ‘0’ in the 7’s place is implied—remember ‘no leading zeros’ in our earlier odometer examples.) So, counting our 7-note DO-RE-MI scale using base 7, these two rules always hold true:• DO is always 0 in the 1’s place, and • The 7’s place indicates how many octaves up we’ve gone• Musical GematriaNow we are ready to do ‘musical gematria’. Let’s take the name ‘Jesus’, which in Greek was IĒSOUS (Ἰησοῦς)22. By Greek gematria this has the value Ἰησοῦς (IĒSOUS) = 10 + 8 + 200 + 70 + 400 + 200 = 888(As opposed to the number of ‘The Beast’ which is 666 in the Book of Revelation!23)Now, 88810 = 24067(That is, 888 base 10 = 2406 base 7. By the way, re-expressing a number in a different base is a bit of a mathematical chore. Fortunately, we now have computers to do this for us!).Simply numbering DO RE MI, counting from 0, we have:‘Rewriting’ the digits of 24067 into their musical equivalents, we have:By octave equivalence we can move TI down an octave (that is, TI will still be TI, regardless of its octave) to get a more graceful musical gesture if we want:"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"16Musical GematriaThis was an example of how to do musical gematria for ‘melody’—I suppose we could call it ‘melodic gematria’.

Because these examples presume more ability to read music, I’ve consigned them to the appendices."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"17William ZeitlerThe Signifi cance of Musical GematriaWe saw how the relationship between the Cosmos and Number was very close for the Pythagoreans. We saw how the Pythagoreans were particularly interested in vibrating strings and their mathematical properties. In modern physics, the current frontrunner theory of ‘what everything is made of’ is known as ‘string theory’ because it is based on the same fundamental mathematics as that of vibrating strings.24 Thus, according to string theory, the basic building blocks of the Cosmos amount to infi nitesimally small monochords! Maybe Pythagoras was more prescient than anyone could have guessed!As Betrand Russell noted: “Perhaps the oddest thing about Modern Science is its return to Pythagoreanism.”25We also saw how the ancient Greeks and Hebrews26 used the letters of their alphabet both as letters and as digits, so the veil between ‘words’ and ‘numbers’ was very thin. We saw how investigation into the relationships of words and numbers is called ‘gematria’:"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"18Musical Gematria We also saw how the Greeks used the gematria values of divine names as dimensions in their temples. The term ‘sacred geometry’ refers to the use of geometry in the design of sacred spaces—the gematria of divine names applied to designing sacred spaces would seem to fall under that heading. And if the Greeks used gematria in the design of buildings, might they have used it in their sculptures and other art works? After all, they applied sophisticated geometry to their visual arts.27Finally, with ‘musical gematria’, we are able to integrate not just pitch ratios on a monochord, but Music itself into Pythagoras’ Grand Number Theory:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"19William ZeitlerThe concept behind this diagram is hardly new.

I’ve chosen:וןשרה תחבצל אני“I am the rose of Sharon.” (Song of Songs 2:1)In Hebrew writing at the time this was written (and until the 1st millennium) words were not separated by spaces.

Number Words and Number Symbols a Cultural History of Numbers, p.26213 Ifrah, From One To Zero, p.275ff14 See the entry on ‘gematria’ in Trumble & Brown, Shorter Oxford English Dictionary15 Fideler, Jesus Christ, Sun of God, 216-21916 Contenau, Everyday Life in Babylon and Assyria, p.16617 Certain Hebrew letters have more than one form—the form to the right is used at the end of words. Some versions of Hebrew gematria assign values greater than 400 to these fi nal forms.18 Ifrah, From One To Zero, p.270; Menninger & Broneer. Number Words and Number Symbols, pp. 264-5; Gullberg, Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers, p.3819 The Hebrews had their own system of additional marks to make sure numbers were correctly identifi ed as numbers. See Ifrah, From One To Zero, 251ff20 ‘Gematria’ was a very small part of the larger system of Kabbalah. See Kabbalah, Scholem"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"28Musical Gematria21 Due to a phenomenon called ‘inharmonicity’ in real-world stringed instruments, octaves are sometimes ‘stretched’ a tiny amount greater than an exact 1:2 ratio to sound better. 22 Thanks to Alexander the Great (336-323 BCE) who spread Greek language and culture throughout his empire, Greek became a common ‘second language’ in the ancient Mediterranean world. Greek was certainly a common language in the crossroads that was fi rst century Palestine, and it seems entirely possible that Jesus was at least bilingual, speaking both Greek and Aramaic, and using whatever made the most sense for the audience at hand. Meanwhile, some scholars insist Jesus only spoke Greek, others that he only spoke Aramaic. In any event, the Greek gematria value of IĒSOUS (Ἰησοῦς) was used by early Christians—see Fideler, Jesus Christ, Sun of God and Berry, Greek Qabalah.23 Rev.13:18. Ancient New Testament manuscripts disagree on this point, however: the number of The Beast could be 616 instead—see the apparatus for Rev.13:18 in Nestle et al, Biblia Sacra. For a mind-numbing catalog of gematria and numerology in the Bible, see Bullinger, Number in Scripture.24 Greene, The Elegant Universe is a fascinating and reader-friendly introduction to string theory.25 Quoted in Ghyka, The Geometry of Art and Life, p.16826 Gematria was by no means limited to just Greek and Hebrew. There was also Latin and Coptic gematria, to name only two.27 Ghyka, The Geometry of Art and Life, 133ff.28 Plato, Charmides ; Alcibiades I and II ; Hipparchus ; The Lovers ; Theages ; Minos ; Epinomis, 991E-992/p.48529 The reader may notice that this chart could be rewritten:002 Rest/Silence/Neither Drum012 High drum102 Low drum112 High + low drumIn other words, a 1 in the 1’s place of our binary representation of the drums to strike indicates the high drum, and a 1 in the 10’s place of our binary representation of the drums to strike indicates the low drum.30 Since we won’t use leading-zeros, our rhythmic gematria will never begin with a ‘0’.31 And a four-dimensional ‘hypercube’ would give us 4 notes at a time.32 Seven note scales have a special place in Western music, especially the well-known “DO-RE-MI” scale (and its modes). But just as there is a place for non-base-10 numbers, there is also a place for non-7-note scales. The ‘whole-tone’ and ‘diminished’ scales would be examples of non-7-note scales already in use in the West.33 The C major scale has no sharps or fl ats. The two scales with one accidental are G major (one sharp) and F major (one fl at). It is no accident that G is a perfect 5th up from C, and F is a perfect 5th down from C. In G major the only note with an accidental is F#. In F"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"29William Zeitlermajor the only note with an accidental if Bb.
