Rather, it is to help them todiscoverthisscience.[Throughout this work, ‘science’ means ‘branch of knowledgethat is theoretically organised, highly structured, and soundly based’.]For some learned people, philosophy is just the history ofphilosophy (ancient and modern); these preliminaries aren’twritten for them. They must wait their turn. When thosewho work to draw·truth·from the well of reason itself havedone their work,thenthe historians can give the world thenews about their results.·But they won’t regard it asnews,because·nothing can be said now that the historians won’tthink has been said already! And it is safe to predict thatthey’ll think the same about anything said in the future;human understanding has busied itself for centuries withcountless topics in many ways, so it is to be expected thatevery new idea will resemblesomethingthat has been saidin the past.If you think that metaphysics is worth studying, my aimis to convince you of the following:It is absolutely necessary that you stop your workfor a while, regard anything that has been done asnothaving been done, and face up to the preliminaryquestion ofwhether such a thing as metaphysics iseven possible.If it is a science, why can’t it get universal and lastingapproval, like other sciences? If it is not, what enables it togo on giving itself airs with itspretenceof being a science,keeping men’s minds in suspense with hopes that neverdie but are never fulfilled? If we are to show that there’sknowledge to be had from metaphysics, or to show that thereisn’t, we must once and for all reach a conclusion about thenature of this would-be science, for it can’t go on as it hasbeen doing. It seems close to ridiculous, when every otherscience makes steady progress, that this one—claiming tobe wisdom personified, the oracle that everyone consults—goes on circling around the same spot, never taking a stepforwards. Its fringe hangers-on have scattered; and peoplewho are sure enough that they can shine in other scienceswon’t be found risking their reputations in this one, wherethere are no objective standards for distinguishing soundknowledge from mere chatter, so that any ignoramus canfeel entitled to pass judgment.There’s nothing extraordinary in the idea that whenpeople have worked hard at a science they should wonder•how much progress it has made, and be led from that towonder•whether such a science is possible at all. Humanreason so lovesbuildingthat it has repeatedly built a tower·of theory·and then dismantled it to check the soundnessof the foundation. It is never too late to become reasonableand wise; but if an insight comes late, it will be that muchharder to make use of it.When we ask whether a certain science ispossible, thatpresupposes that we have doubts about whether it isactual.That doubt will shock anyone whose whole fortune, perhaps,consists in this supposed jewel·called ‘metaphysics’·; andso anyone who voices the doubt can expect to be attackedon all sides. Some of the attackers—clutching their big meta-physical books, and proudly conscious of their·intellectual·possessions, which they think are legitimate because theyare old!—will look down on him with contempt. Others, for1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantIntroductionwhom everything they see is all of a piece with somethingthey have seen before, won’t understand him. And for awhile things will stay as they were, as though nothing hadhappened to raise the hope or the fear of an impendingchange.Nevertheless, I confidently predict that if you read thesepreliminaries and think for yourself,not only will you come to doubt the·supposed·sci-ence that you have practised·under the name ofmetaphysics·, but eventually you’ll become quite surethat nothinglikethatcanexist without satisfying thedemands that I shall state here—demands on whichits possibility depends. You will also become sure thatsince the demands never have been met, there has uptill now been no such thing as metaphysics.But the search for metaphysics will continue, because theinterests of human reason are so closely bound up with it;so you’ll agree that metaphysics is unstoppably on the roadto a total reform (or, better, a new birth) on a wholly newplan, even if people struggle against it for a while.David Hume’s attack on•metaphysics was more decisivefor•its fate than any other event since theEssaysof Lockeand Leibniz—actually, since the earliest recorded beginningsof metaphysics. Hume threw nolighton this kind of knowl-edge, but he strucka sparkfrom which a light could havebeen kindled if it had fallen on something flammable and theresultant smoulder had been nursed into flames.Hume’s primary starting-point was a single importantmetaphysical concept, namely that ofthe connection of causewith effect(including derivative concepts like those offorceandactionand so on). Reason purports to have given birthto this concept, but Hume challenged reason thus:Explain to me what entitles you to think there couldbe a thing x such that:given that there is x, theremust necessarily also be something else y—for that’swhat the concept of cause says.He showed beyond question that it is completely impossiblefor reason to have—in ana prioriway and purely throughconcepts·with no input from experience·—the thought ofsuch a union·of x with y·, because the thought of such aunion includes the thought of necessity. We cannot at all seewhy, given that one thing exists, some other thingnecessar-ilymustexist, or how the concept of such a connection couldarisea priori. From this he inferred that reason is utterlydeluded regarding the concept of cause, wrongly thinkingit to be among her own children when really it is a bastardchild of the imagination that was got in the family way byexperience. What the imagination did·according to Hume·was to consider certain sense-impressions that were relatedto one another by the law of association—·so that after experiencing many F impressionsfollowed by G ones, you get into thehabitof expectinga G whenever you experience an F, the habit becomingstrong enough so that any new experience of an Fcompelsyou to expect a G·—and to mistake a•subjective necessity (habit) for the•objective necessity arising from grasping what must bethe case. He inferred that reason can’t form a thought ofthe formx is necessarily and objectively connected with y, oreven with thegeneralthought of thatkindof connection.If reason did produce any such thought (Hume held), theconcepts it involved would be fictitious, and all reason’sclaims toa prioriknowledge would be merely the mis-labelleddeliverances of ordinary experience. He was saying in effectthat metaphysics couldn’t possibly exist.[At this point Kant hasa footnote, as follows:]Yet Hume called this destructive scienceof his ‘metaphysics’ and put a great price on it. ‘Metaphysicsand morals’, he says, ‘are the most important branches of2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantIntroductionlearning. Mathematics and natural science are not half sovaluable.’ But all that this brilliant man had in his view wasthe negative work involved in damping down the extravagantclaims of speculative reason and thus settling many endlessand vexatious controversies that lead mankind astray. Helost sight of the positive harm that is done when reason isrobbed of its most important vistas—which it needs if it isto mark out for the will its highest goal in all its endeavours.[End of footnote. That last remark reflects views of Kant’s about reason’slink with freedom, and freedom’s link with morality.]His inference was hasty and wrong, but at least it wasbased on investigation; and this investigation thoroughlydeserved·a better response than it got. It ought·to havebrought together the intelligent people of the time to searchfor a happier solution of Hume’s problem as he had formu-lated it; and if that had happened, a complete reform of thescience·of metaphysics·would have quickly followed.But metaphysicians have always suffered the misfortuneof not being understood by anyone, and this is what hap-pened to Hume. It really hurts to see how totally Hume’sopponents—Reid, Oswald, Beattie, and finally Priestley too—missed the point of his problem. They kept taking for grantedthings that he had called into question, and offered furiousand often arrogant demonstrations of things he had neverthought of questioning; so they didn’t pick up the pointerhe had given to an improvement·that metaphysics mightundergo·. In this they failed so completely that at the endof the debate the status quo was still standing: it was asthough nothing had happened!Hume had never cast doubt on the proposition that theconcept of cause is proper, useful, and even indispensable forour knowledge of nature;thatwasn’t in question. Whatwasin question was whether reason could think that concepta priori. If it could, the concept of causation would be thesource of an inner truth—truths coming just from itself,not from anything outside it given through experience—sothat it could be appliedtothings other than merely theobjects of experience.Thatwas Hume’s problem. He wasn’tchallenging our indispensableneedfor the concept of cause,but merely asking what its origin is. If the origin was settled,questions about the conditions governing the use of theconcept, and about the domain in which it can be validlyused, would automatically have been answered also.To deal adequately with this problem, however, Hume’sopponents would have had to dig deeply into the nature ofreason, considered as the faculty of pure thinking: not a jobto their taste! They were more comfortable with a differentapproach, one that let them defy Hume without bringing anyinsight to his problem, namely by appealing tocommon sense.It is indeed a great gift from heaven to have plain commonsense. But this common sense must be shown in practice,through judicious and reasonable thoughts and words, notby appealing to it as an oracle when one has no rationalarguments to offer.Appeal to common sense when insightand science have failed you, but don’t appeal to it beforethen!—that·rule of intellectual conduct·is one of the deviousinventions of recent times, and it enables a shallow ranter tojoin battle with a solid thinker, and hold his own. But anyonewith a flicker of insight left to him would be carefulnottograsp at this straw. If you place this appeal to common sensein a clear light you will see that it is nothing but an appealto the opinion of the mob—whose applause embarrasses thephilosopher but brings joy and reassurance to the popularsmart alec. I should think that Hume had as much claimto sound common sense as Beattie did, and he also hadsomething that Beattie lacked, namely acritical reasonthatrestrains common sense so that•it doesn’t speculate or, ifspeculations are the topic of discussion,•it doesn’t crave for3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantIntroductionany decision when it isn’t satisfied that it has the argumentsto support one. This is the only way someone’s commonsense can remain sound. Chisels and hammers can servevery well in working wood, but for copperplate we need anengraver’s needle.Thus•sound common sense and•speculative understand-ing are both useful, but each in its own way:•the formerserves in judgments that apply immediately to experience,•the latter comes into play when universal judgments frommere concepts are to be made, as in metaphysics. In thelatter environment sound common sense has absolutely noright to judge.Here is an open confession about something that hap-pened many years ago: it was my recollection of·the thoughtof·David Hume that broke into my dogmatic slumber, andpointed my work in speculative philosophy in a completelynew direction. I was nowhere near accepting hisconclusions.He had reached them by looking at only a part of hisproblem—a part that by itself can give us no information.·Still·, if we start from a well-founded but undevelopedthought that someone else has left to us, we can hope thatby continuing to think it through we shall get further thandid the brilliant man to whom we owe the first spark of light.So I tried first to see whether Hume’s objection could beput into a general form, and I soon got a result:The concept ofthe cause-effect connectionis far frombeing the only idea by which the understanding hasapriorithoughts about the connections of things. Onthe contrary, metaphysics consists purely of suchconcepts—·i.e. concepts of the connections of things·.I tried to find out how many such concepts there are, andsucceeded in this in the desirable way, namely by startingfrom a single principle. Then I proceeded to the deductionof these concepts, which I was now certain didn’t come from•experience (which is all that Hume provided for them) butrather from•pure understanding.[By the phrase ‘the deduction ofthese concepts’ Kant refers to a theoretically grounded and justifiedlistof the concepts in question]—something that proves and explainswhy the metaphysical concepts of the connections of thingsare just exactly the ones on the list. This deduction hadseemed impossible to Hume; and apart from him nobodyhad eventhoughtof it, although everyone had confidentlyused the·metaphysical·concepts, without asking what theirobjective validity was based on. The deduction was thehardest task that anyone could tackle in the service ofmetaphysics; and the worst of it was that I couldn’t get helpfrom metaphysics as it then was, because this deduction iswhat’s needed to make metaphysics possible. But·despitegetting no help from metaphysics·Ididsucceed in solvingthe Humean problem, not merely for a particular case·of thecause-effect connection·but with respect to the whole facultyof pure reason. With that done, I could safely—thoughalways slowly—go on to map out the whole domain of purereason, establishing its boundaries and its contents. I did allthis completely, and from general principles, which is whatmetaphysics needed if its system was to be securely built.I expounded the Humean problem in its most generalpossible form in my bookCritique of Pure Reason; but I amafraid that that work may go the same way as the problem didwhen Hume first propounded it. The book will be misjudgedbecause misunderstood; and people will misunderstand itbecause they are inclined to skim through the book ratherthanthinking it through. That is·admittedly·a disagreeabletask, because the work conflicts with all ordinary concepts,as well as being dry, obscure, and long-winded!·Despitethose drawbacks·, I confess that I didn’t expect to hear aphilosophercomplain that the book isn’t a crowd-pleaser,not entertaining, not an easy read, given that what’s at issue4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantIntroductionin it is no less than the existence of a highly prized andindispensable kind of knowledge—a question thatcan’tbesettled except by working strictly according to rule and withgreat precision. Such work might in the course of timeplease the crowd; but·a concern for·popularity is quiteinappropriate at the start. Still, one of the complaints isjustified: the book’s plan is diffuse, making it hard for thereader to keep in mind the chief points of the investigation;and that contributes to a certain obscurity. I intend toremedy that with thesePreliminaries.The earlier work, which maps out the entire faculty ofpure reason, will be the foundation to which thePreliminariesare to be related. But the latter work—·the book you nowhold in your hands·—is only a preparatory exercise·andnot a contribution to metaphysics itself·; because we can’tthink of letting metaphysics appear on the scene, or evenhave a faint hope of attaining it, until our critique has beenestablished as a science that is complete in every detail.We have long been used to seeing dreary old knowledgespruced up as new by being taken out of its former contextand turned into a system in fancy new clothing with newterminology; and that’s all that most readers will initiallyexpect my critique to be. But thesePreliminariesmay helpthe reader to see that it is·not old stuff in new clothes,but·a wholly new science that no-one has ever thoughtof—indeed, the veryideaof which was unknown—and towhich no previous work has made the slightest contribution.The only exception to that is the pointer one could get fromHume’s doubts; but even he didn’t suspect·there could be·such a possible formal science; instead, he played safe byrunning his ship onto the shore (scepticism), and lettingit lie there and rot. I prefer to give the ship apilotwhocan safely sail it anywhere he likes, by means of secureprinciples of navigation drawn from a knowledge of the globe,and equipped with a complete chart and compass.Suppose we are confronted by a new science that is whollyisolated and the only one of its kind. If we start with theassumption that we can make judgments about it in terms ofknowledge that we have already gained—which is preciselywhat has first to be called in question·when consideringa new science·—all we shall achieve is to see everywherethings we already know, with the•words sounding familiarbut everything seeming (·so far as the•content is concerned·)to be pushed out of shape, senseless, gibberish. That’sbecause we’ll be relying on•our own notions, which longhabit has made second nature for us, instead of relying on•the author’s. But the long-windedness of the work, to theextent that it comes from the science itself and not merelyfrom the exposition, as well as the unavoidable dryness andby-the-rules precision, are qualities that can bring credit tothe science—though not to the book!It isn’t given to many of us to write with the subtlety andgrace of David Hume, or with the solidity and elegance ofMoses Mendelssohn. Yet I flatter myself that I could havewritten in a crowd-pleasing way if my aim·in theCritique ofPure Reason·had been merely to outline a plan and leave itto others to complete, rather than having set my heart on thegood of the science that had occupied me for so long. Indeedit took a lot of perseverance and a good deal of self-denial toput•the prospect of later but more lasting applause aheadof•the enticements of an immediate success.Themaking of plansis often an arrogant and boastful ac-tivity through which someone•gives himself airs as a creativegenius by demanding what he doesn’t himself supply,•findsfault with what he can’t improve, and•makes proposals thathe himself doesn’t know how to carry out—though a soundplan for ageneral critique of pure reason, if it isn’t to amountonly to the usual spouting of pious hopes, will have to have5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantFeatures of metaphysical knowledgemore content than one might expect. But the domain ofpure reason is so•separate from everything else, and so•inter-connected within itself, that we can’t lay a finger onone part without affecting all the others, and can’t buildanything there without first determining where each part isand how it relates to the rest. That’s because our judgment•within this domain can’t be corrected by anything•outsideit, and so the validity and use of every part of the domaindepends on how it relates to all the rest—just as with thestructure of an organism we can work out the purpose ofeach part only from a full conception of the whole. So it canbe said that•such a critique shouldn’t be trusted unless itisperfectly complete, down to the smallest elements of purereason, and that•in the domain of reason you must settleeverything—or you’ll settle nothing.As for a mere plan or sketch of the critique of pure reason:its usefulness as asequelto the critique is a measure ofhow useless—how unintelligible and unreliable—it wouldbe if givenin advance. Taken as a sequel, it gives us avantage-point from which we can take in the whole thing,can test—one by one—the chief points of the science, andcan make the exposition of it much better than it was thefirst time around.[In the next paragraph Kant uses ‘analytic’ and ‘synthetic’ to mark adistinction between twomethods of presentationof some doctrine. An•analytic presentation starts with things we all know to be true andworks its way from those to the theory or doctrine that explains andis supported by them. A•synthetic presentation goes in the oppositedirection: it starts with the fundamental theses of the doctrine to be ex-pounded, and works from those to various of their consequences, whichcould include the things-we-already-know that are thestarting-point forthe analytic format. This use of ‘analytic’ and ‘synthetic’ occursonlyhereand on pages 15 and??. Everywhere else in this work and throughouttheCritique of Pure ReasonKant uses the terms in an utterly differentsense, in which it distinguishes not•expository methods but•kinds ofproposition.Thisuse of the terminology is the one that is still current;Kant explains it in section 2 below.]With my critique of pure reason completed, I now offeraplanof it as a sequel. The plan is to be laid out inthe•analytic manner, whereas the critique itself had tobe composed in the•synthetic style so that readers couldcommand a view of all thejointsof the science—the naturalhanging-together of the structural parts of·pure reason·,an utterly special cognitive faculty. But if you also findthistoo obscure—this plan that I offer as thePreliminar-ies to any future Metaphysic—bear in mind•that it’s notnecessary for everyone to study metaphysics,•that manypeople have the aptitude to succeed very well in sciences(even deep ones) that are closer to sense-experience, yetcan’t succeed in investigations dealing with highly abstractconcepts,•that such people should employ their talents onother subjects;•that someone who undertakes to make judg-ments in metaphysics—let alone to construct a metaphysicalsystem—mustsatisfythe demands I have made here, whichhe can’t do byrejectingthem, so he must either adopt mysolution or thoroughly refute it and put another in its place;and, finally,•that this notorious obscurity (·allegations ofwhich are·often a cloak to cover the accuser’s laziness orstupidity) also has its uses·as a defence against insolent in-truders. There’s no shortage ofthemin metaphysics!·Peoplewho maintain a cautious silence in relation to other sciencesapproach metaphysics in a spirit of bold pronouncementsand snap judgments, because in this area their ignorance isnot contrasted with the knowledge of others.6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantFeatures of metaphysical knowledgePreamble on the special features of all metaphysical knowledge1:The sources of metaphysicsIf a domain of knowledge is to be exhibited as a science, weneed to know exactly what features are special to it, markingit off from all other sciences. Otherwise the boundaries ofall the sciences run into one another and none of them canbe treated soundly according to its own nature. Our ideaof a possible science and of the territory it covers is basedon its special features—whether they have to do with its•subject matter, or its•sources of knowledge, or the•kind ofknowledge it involves, or of some or all of these together.Let us consider first thesourcesof metaphysical knowl-edge. The very concept of metaphysics ensures that thesources of metaphysics can’t be empirical.·If somethingcould be known through the senses, that would automat-ically show that it doesn’t belong to metaphysics; that’san upshot of the meaning of the word ‘metaphysics’·. Itsbasic propositions can never be taken from experience, norcan its basic concepts; for it is not to be physical butmetaphysical knowledge, so it must lie beyond experience.•Outer experience is the source of physics properly so-called,and•inner experience is the basis for empirical psychology;and metaphysical knowledge can’t come from either of these.It is thus knowledgea priori—knowledge based on pureunderstanding and pure reason.Mathematics also answers to that description. To markoff metaphysics from mathematics as well as from empiricalenquiries, we’ll have to call itpure philosophical knowledge.In this phrase, ‘pure’ means ‘not empirical’; and ‘philosoph-ical’ stands in contrast to ‘mathematical’. The differencebetween these two ways of using reason—the mathematicaland the philosophical—is something I needn’t go into here; Ihave adequately described it in myCritique of Pure Reason.So much for the sources of metaphysical knowledge.2:The only kind of knowledge that can be called metaphysi-cal(a)The distinction between synthetic and analytic judgmentsin general.Because of what is special about the sources of metaphysicalknowledge—·namely, that they don’t include experience·—allsuch knowledge must consist in judgments that are madeapriori. However,a priorijudgments can be divided into twogroups, according to their content:(1)those that merely spellout what’s already there, adding nothing to the content of theknowledge, and(2)those that add something, and enlargethe given knowledge. We can call(1)analyticjudgments, and(2)synthetic.Analytic judgments say nothing in the predicate thatwasn’t already thought—though less clearly—in the conceptof the subject. If I say ‘All bodies areextended’, I haven’tadded anything to my concept of body, but have merelyanalysed it. Extension was already implicitly thought of inthe concept ofbody, before I made the judgment. So thejudgment is analytic. On the other hand the proposition‘Some bodies areheavy’ contains something in the predi-cate that isn’t thought—even unclearly or implicitly—in theconcept ofbody. It thus enlarges my knowledge in that itadds something to my concept, and hence must be called asynthetic judgment.(b)The common principle of all analytic judgments is the lawof contradiction.All analytic judgments rest wholly on the law of contradiction.7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantFeatures of metaphysical knowledgeThe predicate of an affirmative analytic judgment has alreadybeen thought in the concept of the subject, so it can’t bedenied of the subject without contradiction. This is thecase with the proposition ‘Every body is extended’.·That’sequivalent to something of the form ‘Everything that is F andextended is extended’, so that to deny it would be to say thatsomething is F and extended and not extended, which is anoutright contradiction. The law of contradiction, which saysthat no contradiction is true, thus underlies the truth of theanalytic proposition that all bodies are extended·.So all analytic propositions area priorijudgments, eventhose that contain empirical concepts as does the judgment‘Gold is a yellow metal’.·I must have experience if I am tohave the concepts of gold, of yellow, and of metal; but·toknow that gold is a yellow metal I need no further experience;all I need is to analyse my concept ofgold, which containsthe concept ofbeing a yellow metal.(c)Synthetic judgments need a different principle from thelaw of contradiction.Some synthetic judgments have an empirical origin, andcan be known onlya posteriori; other synthetic judgmentshavea prioricertainty, and originate in pure understandingand reason. No synthetic judgment can come from the lawof contradiction alone. Such judgments mustconformtothat principle (which is just to say that they mustn’t beself-contradictory), but they can’tbe deducedfrom it.·In the rest of this section four kinds of synthetic judg-ment will be identified and discussed. Although they are allsynthetic—meaning that none of them can be establishedmerely by analysing concepts—three of the four kinds canbe learneda priori·.(1)Judgments of experienceare always synthetic. Itwould be absurd to base an analytic judgment on experience:why go to experience when the judgment can be derivedpurely from my concept? That every body is extended isa proposition that holds apriori,and not a judgment ofexperience. For before I look to experience I already have inthe concept of body all that I need for that judgment: I needonly to extract the predicate (‘extended’) from that conceptaccording to the law of contradiction. In doing that, I alsobecome conscious of thenecessityof the judgment—and·that’s further evidence that this analytic judgment isn’tbased on experience, because·experience can never teachme that something is necessary.(2)Mathematical judgmentsare all, without exception,synthetic. This is certainly true and is very important, but itseems to have escaped the notice of all previous analysersof human reason, and indeed to be directly opposed toall their theories. Those earlier thinkers saw that all theinferencesof mathematicians proceedaccording tothe law ofcontradiction, and wrongly slipped into thinking that math-ematicaltruthswere knownfromthe law of contradiction.This was a great mistake. The law of contradiction canlead one to a synthetic proposition, but onlyfromanothersynthetic proposition. (Still, it must be borne in mind thatmathematical propositions are alwaysa priorijudgments,not empirical ones. They carry necessity with them, andthat can’t be learned about from experience. If you disagree,I shan’t argue; I shall merely make this claim about thepropositions ofpure—i.e. non-empirical—mathematics!)One might think that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is analytic,and that it follows according to the law of contradiction fromthe concept ofthe sum of 7 and 5.But if we look more closely, we find that the concept of thesum of 7 and 5 contains onlythe uniting of 7 and 5 into a single number;8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantFeatures of metaphysical knowledgeand in thinking this we don’t have the least thought of whatthis single number is in which the two are combined. I cananalyse my concept of the uniting of seven and five as long asI please—I shall never find 12 in it. I have to go outside theseconcepts and—with the help of an intuition that correspondsto one of them (my five fingers for instance)—add the 5 givenin intuition to the concept of 7, adding them one by one.Thus in this proposition7 + 5 = 12we really amplify ourconcept·of 7 + 5·, adding to it new concept that wasn’tthought in it. That is to say,arithmetical propositions arealways synthetic. It will be easier to grasp this if we takelarger numbers. It is obvious that however we might turnand twist our concept ofthe sum of 38976 and 45204we could never find 84180 in it through mere analysis,without the help of intuition.[Kant’s use of the term ‘intuition’ needs to be explained. Tradi-tionally, the word has had two meanings.•In one it contrasts with‘demonstration’—you know something intuitively if it is immediately self-evident to you, whereas demonstrative knowledge involves a series ofdeductive steps.•In the other meaning—which alone is relevant toKant—our faculty of ‘intuition’ is our ability to be mentally confrontedby individual things, to have in our minds representations ofthe thingsand not merely of certainfeatures or propertiesof them. Kant uses‘intuition’ to stand not just for the faculty but also for the mental rep-resentations that it involves. Thus, for example, when you see theLincoln Memorial you havean intuitionof it, and this is an exercise ofyourfaculty of intuition. That intuition is a ‘sensible’ one, meaning thatyou get it through your senses. It stands in contrast with aconceptof the Lincoln Memorial—such as the concept or abstract thought of alarge white memorial to a great American statesman. Having in yourmind a (conceptual) representation of a large white memorial etc. is quitedifferent from having in your mind an (intuitive) representation of theLincoln Memorial, that one particular individual object.[Now, Kant holds that we are also capable of having in our mindsintuitions that don’t come from the senses; he calls them ‘pure’ or ‘apriori’ intuitions. When in the previous paragraph he speaks of theintuition of my five fingers, that is a•sensible intuition: I feel or lookat the fingers. But he believes—as we’ll see in section 7—-that puremathematics involves•pure intuitions: for example, a geometer worksout the properties of circles not by merely taking the abstract conceptcircleand analysing it, but by somehow giving himself a pure intuitionof a circle, and working out the properties of all circles from that. Thisis something like imagining-a-circle, but it isn’t ordinary imagination,which is copied from sense experience.[The basic idea is something like this: Every time you see or feelsomething circular, various aspects of your mental state are contributedby the sensations that come from outside you, and others are contributedby your understanding, i.e. the concept-using faculty. If all of that weresomehow stripped off, what would be left is a very thin, abstract intuitionofthe circular thingjust asa circle. That is, nothing would be left of it butits purely spatial or geometrical properties; they will be the same for everycircular thing; so the stripped down intuition will be the same in eachcase. That stripped down intuition is what Kant calls a ‘pure intuition’of a circle. According to him, this isn’t contributed by sensation fromoutside you; rather, it is conferred on your mental state by your ownmind, specifically by your own faculty of sensible intuition. You are sobuilt, he thinks, that you have to experience the world outside yourselfas spatial, not because the outer worldisspatial but because you imposespatiality on the intuitions you have of it. Kant puts this, sometimes, bysaying that what’s represented in a pure intuition is theformof yoursensibility or of your sensible intuition.[For the geometer to establish synthetic truths about circles, Kantholds, he must not only have•the conceptcirclebut must also have•apure intuition of a circle. This pure intuition, he sometimes says,exhibitsthe concept; it illustrates or exemplifies it; it shows the geometrician whata circle is, taking him from the merely conceptualthoughtof circles to akind of abstract non-sensoryviewof a circle.[The same story can be re-told about the perceptions ofevents: stripoff everything empirical, and everything conceptual, and you are left witha mere, bare, pure intuition of time. As•space is a form of your sen-sibility in experiencing things outside yourself,•time—Kant thinks—isa form of your sensibility in relation not only to things outside you butalso to the flow of your mental history. Just as geometry is based on pureintuitions of space (or of spatial figures), Kant says, arithmetic is basedon pure intuitions of time; see section 10. We now return to Kant’s text.]9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantFeatures of metaphysical knowledgeNor is any principle of pure geometry analytic. Thata straight line is the shortest path between two points isa synthetic proposition. For my concept of straightnesscontains nothing having to do with•quantity—it is purely a•qualitative concept—so it can’t contain the thought of whatisshortest,·because that is quantitative·. Here again, weneed help from intuition if we are to have a basis for puttingshortesttogether withstraight.Why are we so prone to believe that in such a judgmentthe predicate is already contained in our concept so thatthe judgment is analytic? The source of this mistake is acertain ambiguity. We ought to join in thought a certainpredicate (’shortest’) to a given concept (’straight’), and thisrequirement is inherent in the concepts themselves. But thequestion isn’t what we•ought tothinkalong withthe givenconcept but what we•dothinkinit, even if unclearly. Oncewe distinguish those, we can see that while the predicateis indeed attached to the subject concept necessarily, it isattachedonly through an intuition that must also be present;it isn’t to be foundinthe subject concept itself.Some other principles that geometers use are indeedreally analytic and rest on the law of contradiction: forexample ‘Everything is equal to itself’, and ‘The whole isgreater than its part’. These identical propositions can beuseful in setting out arguments, but they don’t actuallysay anything; they can be useful methodologically, but theydon’t contribute to the content of what is said. Furthermore,even these analytic propositions, though they are indeedvalidated purely by our concepts, wouldn’t be allowed intomathematics if they couldn’t be illustrated by propositionsthat are connected with intuition.·For example, ‘The wholeis greater than its part’ is allowed into mathematics becauseit can be applied to numbers, areas and lengths, which aregiven to us in intuition·.Pure mathematical knowledge differs from all othera pri-oriknowledge in this: it never proceedsfromconcepts, but isalways achieved byconstruction ofconcepts. Mathematicalpropositions must therefore go beyond theconceptto whatthe correspondingintuitioncontains,·because this intuitionguides the construction of the concept·; hence they can’tand shouldn’t come from the analysis of concepts, and aretherefore one and all synthetic.This may seem a small and unimportant point; butthe neglect of it has done harm to philosophy. Humehad the worthy philosophical aim of surveying the wholedomain of purea prioriknowledge—a domain in which thehuman understanding lays claim to great possessions—buthe carelessly sliced off a large part of the territory, itsmost considerable province, namely pure mathematics. Hethought that mathematics rested on the law of contradictionalone. Although he didn’t classify propositions in quite theway that I do here, or with the same names, hein effectsaid: Pure mathematics contains only analytic propositions,but metaphysics containsa priorisynthetic propositions.Now this was a great mistake, which infected his wholesystem of thought. If he hadn’t made this mistake, he wouldhave taken his question about the origin of our·a priori·synthetic judgments to cover not only•metaphysics (e.g. theconcept of causality) but also•mathematics. He had toomuch insight to base mathematics on mere experience, so·if he had likened metaphysics to mathematics in the wayI have been defending·he would have spared metaphysicsfrom the vile mistreatment to which he subjected it, becausethat attack would have hit on mathematics as well, whichHume can’t have wanted to do. And then, fine thinker thathe was, he would have been drawn into lines of thoughtlike those that I am now offering—though he would havepresented them in his own uniquely elegant style.10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantFeatures of metaphysical knowledge(3)[following(2), which began on page 8.]Natural sciencealsocontains synthetic judgments that can be knowna priori, forexample:•In all changes in the physical world the quantity ofmatter remains unchanged.•When one body collides with another, action andreaction must always be equal.Clearly these are not only necessary anda prioriin originbut are also synthetic.·I shall show this of the first ofthem.

In judgingthat matter is permanent, therefore, I go beyond the conceptof matter in order to addtoit something that I didn’t thinkinit. So the proposition isn’t analytic but synthetic; yet itis thoughta priori, as are the other propositions of the purepart of natural science—·the ‘pure’ part being the part thatowes nothing to experience·.[This paragraph on natural scienceis brought across from theCritique of Pure Reason. There’s evidencethat Kant intended such a paragraph to occur here, and omitted it byaccident.](4)Properly metaphysicaljudgments are all synthetic.The whole aim of metaphysics is to arrive at conclusionsthat are synthetic. Analytic judgments are also involved, butonly as aids to constructing•arguments; what metaphysics,properly so-called, is really about is the establishment of•conclusions, which are always synthetic. If a concept(such as that of substance) belongs to metaphysics, then the·analytic·judgments that analyse this concept also belongthere—for example the judgment that substance is thatwhich exists only as subject etc.–and a set of such judgmentscan be used to work towards a definition of the concept inquestion. But such a•judgment belongs to metaphysics onlybecause the analysed•concept does; the process of analysisis just the same as we use when analysing empirical conceptsthat don’t belong to metaphysics. The only judgments thatare really strictly metaphysical are synthetic ones.When thea prioriconcepts that are the building-bricksof metaphysics have been gathered together in a systematicway, the analysis of them is of great value. The analyticjudgments that are arrived at in this way can be separatedout from the rest of metaphysics, and presented as a sep-arate part of the whole system. The only use that theseanalyses have in metaphysics is as a useful preliminary tothe procedure of arrivinga prioriat synthetic propositionsinvolving the concepts that have been analysed.The upshot of this section is that metaphysics is centrallyconcerned witha prioriknowledge of synthetic propositions.These are what metaphysics is for. We are helped to arriveat them by analyses and analytic judgments—indeed, onesusing the very same process of analysis as we do when tryingto clarify our concepts in other branches of knowledge. Butthe essential content of metaphysics is thegenerationofknowledge apriori, both according to intuition and accordingto concepts, leading ultimately to synthetic propositionsapriori—philosophical knowledge.3:A note about the analytic/synthetic distinctionThe distinction between analytic and synthetic is essential inthe present kind of enquiry into the human understanding; itisn’t much used anywhere else, so far as I know. The reasonwhy dogmatic philosophers overlooked this apparently obvi-ous distinction is that they didn’t look for the sources of meta-physics in the pure laws of reason in general·and so theydidn’t see how metaphysical truths could be knowna priori11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantGeneral Problemsand yet be synthetic·.[By ‘dogmatic’ philosophers Kant means,broadly speaking, ones who plunge ahead doing metaphysics withoutfirst raising the question of how—or indeed whether—metaphysics ispossible.]Thus two recent German philosophers tried to derivethe law of sufficient reason, which is obviously synthetic,from the law of contradiction.[The law of sufficient reason saysthat there’s a reason for everything that is the case, i.e. that there’s acorrect answer to every ‘Why?’-question.]Still, there is a hint of thisdistinction in Locke’sEssayat IV.iii.9ff. Having previouslydiscussed the different kinds of judgments and how we arriveat them, including•judgments of ‘identity or contradiction’ (which areanalytic), and•judgments of ‘co-existence’ (which are synthetic),he admits that oura prioriknowledge of the latter is verynarrow and almost nothing at all.·Grudging as that is, itdoes at least admit thepossibilityofsomesynthetica prioriknowledge·. But what he says of this kind of knowledge isso skimpy and unsystematic that it’s not surprising thatit didn’t prompt anyone—and in particular didn’t promptHume—to consider propositions of this kind. It is hard tolearn universal and yet definite truths from someone whoonly had them floating obscurely before him in his thought!One needs to discover them for oneself, in one’s own thinking;thenone can find them elsewhere, where one would certainlynot have found them before because the authors weren’t clearin their own minds about what they were saying.·That’s howI found the analytic/synthetic distinction in Locke’s pageswhen Hume didn’t find it there: the crucial point is that Ihad first worked out the distinction for myself·.General Problems4:The general problem of thePreliminaries: is metaphysicspossible at all?If we had a real metaphysics that could claim to be ascience—if we could say ‘Here is metaphysics, all you have todo is to learn it, and it will convince you of its truth’—then wewouldn’t have to ask whether metaphysics is possible,·justas we don’t have to ask whether geometry, say, is possible·.Our only question would concernhowit is possible, andhow reason should set about doing metaphysics; and thiswould be•a test of our mental skills, not•a challenge to theexistence of the thing itself.However, things haven’t turned out so well for humanreason. There’s no single book that one can point to. . . .andsay, ‘This is metaphysics; here you will find knowledge ofa highest being and of a future world, which is the noblestaim of this science, proved from principles of pure reason.’Many propositions have been agreed without dispute to benecessary and certain, but they are all analytic, and concernthe materials and building-stones of metaphysics ratherthan the enlargement of our knowledge. You may point tosome synthetic propositions (e.g. the law of sufficient reason)which are widely accepted, though you have never provedthem through mere reason,a priori, as you ought to have.12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantGeneral ProblemsHelp yourself to them; but when you want to use them forsome serious purpose you will find yourself caught up inwrong or dubious assertions—the sort of thing that has setmetaphysical systems against one another in their doctrinesor in their arguments, destroying their claims to be believed.Indeed, the very attempts to create a science of meta-physics were the first cause of early scepticism—a way ofthinking in which reason attacks itself so violently that itcould never have arisen except in complete despair aboutour ability to carry out reason’s most important designs.Men began to investigate reason itself, long before startingmethodically to investigate nature·in the physical sciences·.Even at that stage, reason had already been employed inconnection with ordinary experience; and reason is alwayspresent to us, whereas laws of nature have to be laboriouslysought out. So metaphysics floated to the top like foam,which dissolved the moment it was scooped off. But as soonas one lot of foam dissolved, more came frothing up to thesurface. Some philosophers eagerly collected foam; sometried to show their wisdom by ridiculing the vain efforts ofothers; none looked for the cause of the foam down in thedepths.We are tired of dogmatism that teaches us nothing, andjust as tired of scepticism that promises us nothing (not evenpermission to rest comfortably in ignorance). The knowledgewe need is important, and that’s a challenge to us; but wehave had centuries of bad experience with things we thoughtwe knew through ‘pure reason’ that turned out not to beknowledge at all, and that fact makes us suspicious.·So weare•under pressure to push on forwards, and also•nervousabout doing so·. Where do we go from here? That dependson the answer to the question ‘Is metaphysics possible atall?’ We should try to answer this not by picking awaysceptically at particular doctrines of this or that actualsystem of metaphysics—for we don’t yet admit that thereareany systems of metaphysics—but by considering theconceptof such a science.In theCritique of Pure ReasonI tackled this problem bylooking into pure reason itself: by establishing the natureof reason, I was able to work out what its materials andmethods must be. This is hard to do. It demands a readerwho is resolved to think himself gradually into a systembased on reason itself and on nothing else, aiming to developknowledge out of that alone, without help from any fact.Because the present work is calledPreliminaries, on theother hand, it ought to consist of preliminary exercises;they should aim not to•expound the science itself butrather to•show what’s needed for the science to be broughtinto existence. Preliminaries should try to get help fromsomething that is already known to be reliable, from whichone can confidently work back to the ultimate sources thataren’t yet known.Although we can’t take it for granted that there is anysuch science as metaphysics, we can—fortunately—say withconfidence that some pure synthetica prioriknowledge isreal and that we already have it. I refer topure mathe-maticsandpure natural science. Each of these containspropositions that are everywhere recognized—partly throughreason that shows them to be necessary and certain, andpartly through universal agreement arising from experience(though not actually based on experience). So we have somea priorisynthetic knowledge that is, at least, unchallenged;we don’t have to askwhethersuch knowledge is possible (forit is real), but onlyhowit is possible. When we can answerthat, we’ll know how to go about showing the possibility ofall other kinds of synthetica prioriknowledge.13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantGeneral Problems5:The general problem: how can there be knowledge basedon pure reason?We have seen the vast difference between analytic andsynthetic judgments. It is easy to see how there can beanalytic propositions:they come purely from the law of contradiction. There is alsono special problem about how there can besynthetic propositions that are knowna posteriori,i.e. known from experience: experience itself is nothingbut a continual joining together of perceptions,·so it isn’tsurprising that it enables us to join concepts in a syntheticway. Returning to an example used earlier, the syntheticproposition thatsome bodies are heavycan be establishedthrough experiences in which•perceptions of body are joinedwith•perceptions of weight·. What we do have a problemabout is the possibility ofsynthetic propositions that are knowna priori.Whatever makes this sort of knowledge possible, it isn’t thelaw of contradiction·and it isn’t experience·, so we mustsearch to find out what it is.But we cannot rightly start by askingwhethersynthetica prioripropositions are possible. For there are plenty ofthem, really given to us with undisputed certainty; and asour present procedure involves starting with what we alreadyknow, we shall start from the premise that there is humana prioriknowledge of some synthetic propositions. But thenwe still have to askhowthis knowledge is possible, i.e. whatmakes itpossible. When we know this, we can learn how touse such knowledge and can learn what its limits are. Statedprecisely, then, the crucial question is this:How is it possible to have a priori knowledge of syn-thetic propositions?·In the title of this section·I expressed this as a questionabout ‘knowledge based on pure reason’. It wouldn’t havedone any harm to use that same formulation here, for itmust be clear to every reader that when I speak here of‘knowledge based on pure reason’ I always mean knowledgeof synthetic propositions, never of analytic ones;·and ofcourse knowledge through pure reason is alwaysa priori·.[At this point Kant has a footnote commenting on the shiftfrom the old senses of ‘analytic’ and ‘synthetic’ (explained onpage 6 above) to his new senses for those terms.]Metaphysics stands or falls with the solution to thisproblem. Someone may propound his metaphysical claimsas plausibly as he likes, smothering us with conclusionspiled on conclusions; but if he hasn’t first answered thisquestion properly, we are entitled to say to him:‘This is all pointless ungrounded philosophy and false“wisdom”. You purport to be using pure reason tocreatea prioriknowledge, not by merely analysingconcepts but by making new connections that don’trest on the law of contradiction; and you think youhave insight into these connections independently ofall experience. But how do you get such insight? Howcan you justify your claims?’He can’t answer by appealing to the common sense ofmankind, for that isn’t evidence—it’s mere hearsay. . . .The question must be answered, but that is hard to do.One reason why an answer wasn’t attempted long ago isthat a satisfactory answer to this one question demandsmuch deeper, more persistent and more careful thoughtthan goes into the most lengthy and ambitious metaphysicalworks ever published. (A weightier reason is that nobodythought to ask the question!) Every reader who looks hardat the problem will initially be frightened by how hard itis. Indeed, if it were not that there really is syntheticaprioriknowledge, the thoughtful person would think suchknowledge to be impossible. This is what happened to David14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantGeneral ProblemsHume, although he didn’t put the question to himself inthis general form (which is the form we need if we are toget an answer that is decisive for the whole of metaphysics).Hume asked an intelligent question: How can I arrive at ajudgment in which one concept is connectednecessarilywithanother, even though the one doesn’t contain the other? Hethought it couldn’t be done; which led him to conclude thatonly experience can provide us with such connections. Inother words, he thought that this supposed necessity (whichis the same as this supposeda prioriknowledge) is merelya long-standinghabitof accepting something as true, andhence of taking•a necessity in our thought—·a mere mentalcompulsion·—to be•a necessity in the world.If you want to complain about the toil and trouble thatI am going to give you in solving this problem, I invite youto try solving it in an easier way! Perhaps that will makeyou grateful to the man who has taken this deep task overfor you, and you may even come to be surprised—given howdifficult the problem is—that the solution isn’t even harderthan it is. I have had to work for many years•to solve thisproblem in its full scope—i.e. covering all the cases—andfinally also•to be able to present it in the analytic form, asyou will find it here.[This is the old sense of ‘analytic’, explained onpage 6]All metaphysicians are therefore solemnly and legallysuspended from their business until they have satisfactorilyanswered the question: How isa prioriknowledge of syn-thetic propositions possible? Only an answer to this willprovide them with the credentials they must produce if weare to credit them with teaching us things in the name ofpure reason. If they can’t produce those credentials, we—asreasonable men who have often been deceived—should flatlyrefuse to listen to them, without asking any more about whatthey are offering.They may want to carry on their business not as asciencebut as anartof swaying people with pronouncements thatare good for them and agreeable to ordinary common sense.They are entitled to ply this trade; but then they should speakthe modest language of rational belief, admitting that theymustn’t claim to•know—and shouldn’t even•conjecture—anything about what lies beyond the bounds of possibleexperience. The most they can legitimately do is to•assumethings; and even then they aren’t making assumptions fortheoretical purposes (for they must renounce those), butsolely for practical use, assuming whatever is needed to guideour thought and behaviour in everyday life. That’s their onlychance of being useful and wise. It will be better, too, ifthey give up the name ‘metaphysician’; for metaphysicians,properly so-called, aim to be theoretical philosophers; theytry to establish judgmentsa priori, which means necessaryjudgments; so they can’t fool around with conjectures. Whatthey assert is science or it is nothing at all. . . .In now proceeding to the answer to the question ‘Howisa prioriknowledge of synthetic propositions possible?,according to the analytic[old sense]method in which wepresuppose that such knowledge through pure reason is real,we can appeal to only two sciences, namelypure mathematicsandpure natural science. Only these can represent objectsto us in intuition. If one of them should yield an item ofaprioriknowledge, it could show that this knowledge is realby showing that it fits with the intuited object; and we couldthen work back from the reality of this knowledge to whateverit is that makes it possible.In order to move on from these kinds of purea prioriknowledge, which are both real and grounded, to the pos-sible kind of knowledge that we are seeking, namely tometaphysics as a science, we must take our question alittle more broadly. As well as enquiring into•the possibility15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?of metaphysics as a science, we must also investigate•thenatural human disposition to pursue such a science. Thatinvolves looking into thea priorithoughts that are uncrit-ically accepted, developed, andcalled‘metaphysics’. Thetruth of such thoughts is under suspicion, but the thoughtsthemselves are natural enough; they fall within the scope ofour question because they involve the natural conditions outof which metaphysics arises as a science.So our main problem splits into four questions, whichwill be answered one by one:(1)How is pure mathematics possible?(2)How is pure natural science possible?(3)How is metaphysics possible in general?(4)How is metaphysics possible as a science?It may be seen that the solution of these problems, thoughchiefly designed to present the core of theCritique, alsohas an odd feature that is worth attending to separately.We are looking to reason itself for the sources of certainsciences, doing this so that from its performance we canassessreason’spowers as a faculty ofa prioriknowledge.This procedure also brings benefit to those sciences, inrespect not of their content but of their proper use; andthey throw light on the higher question about their commonorigin, while also giving an occasion better to explain theirown nature.Main transcendental Problem 1:How is pure mathematics possible?6Mathematics is a great and proved domain of knowledge; italready has a large scope, and there’s no limit to how far itcan be extended in the future; and its results are absolutelynecessary and certain, which means that they owe nothing toexperience. Mathematical propositions are pure products ofreason, yet they are thoroughly synthetic. How can humanreason create such knowledge whollya priori? Doesn’t ourmathematical faculty, which isn’t and can’t be based onexperience, presuppose some basis fora prioriknowledge?This basis must lie deeply hidden, but we might be able todiscover it through its effects—i.e. through our mathematicalknowledge—if we can track down that knowledge’s sources.7We find that all mathematical knowledge has this specialfeature: it must first exhibit its concept in intuition, doingthisa prioriin an intuition that isn’t empirical but pure.[See the explanation of ‘pure intuition’ on page 9.]Without resort-ing toa prioriintuitions, mathematics can’t take a singlestep. So its judgments are alwaysintuitive. (In contrastwith philosophy, which has to be satisfied withconceptualjudgments. Philosophy mayillustrateits necessary doctrinesthroughintuition, but can neverdeducethemfromit.) Thisfact about mathematics points us to the absolutely basic16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?thing that makes mathematics possible, namely that it isgrounded inpure intuitionsin which it canconstructall itsconcepts—that is, can represent them in a manner that is•concrete rather than abstract, and•a priorirather thanempirical. If we can discover this pure intuition and whatmakes it possible, we will then be able to explain how therecan be synthetica prioripropositions in pure mathematics,and thus how mathematics itself is possible. Empiricalintuition provides us with experiences that enable us toconnect concepts with other concepts, forminga posteriorijudgments that are empirically certain. Pure intuition alsolets us connect concepts with other concepts, but in theircase the synthetic judgment isa prioricertain and necessary,·not merely empirically certain·. Empirical judgments con-tain only what we•happen to have encountered in•empiricalintuition, whereas mathematical judgments contain what•must necessarily be met with in•pure intuition.·The platesor coins or moons that I happen to have seen or felt maybe significantly unlike the ones that you have encountered;but there can’t be any such difference between mya prioriintuition of a circle and yours·. Ana prioriintuition isinseparably joined with the conceptbefore all experience,independently of every particular perception.8Now we seem to have made the problem worse than ever,for now we have to ask: How can one intuit anythinga priori? An intuition is a representation of a sort that·ordinarily·depends directly on the presence of the object.·There’s no problem about an intuition of an object that ispresent to one at the time, or of an object that has beenpresent at an earlier time and is still remembered·. It seemsimpossible, though, to intuit somethinga prioriwithout helpfrom any outer stimulus. Such an intuition would haveto occur without any object•being present or•having beenpresent, to which the intuition could refer; and in that case itcouldn’t be an intuition—·or so it seems·. We can form someconceptsa priori, without being related in any immediateway to an object: we can do this with the concepts thatcontain only the thought of an object in general, without anydetail—for example the concepts ofquantity,cause, and soon. (Though even these have meaning for us only if we usethem concretely, applying them to intuitions through whichwe confront actual instances of quantity and cause in ourexperience.) But how can anintuitionof an object precedethe object itself?9If our intuition had to represent thingsas they are in them-selves, no intuition could ever take placea priori; intuitionwould be empirical every time.·Here is why·. If an intuitiontakes placea priori, then no object of it is present and givento me; but if the object isn’t present and given to me, I can’tknow what it is like in itself. Actually, even if an objectisintuitively present to me, it is incomprehensible how Icould know a thing as it is in itself, for a thing’s propertiescannot migrate into my mind!·Since I can’t get the thing’sown properties into my mind, the most I can do is to havein my mind my representations of them; but that meansthat I am taking in the thing not•as it is in itself but•as Iperceive and think about it·. Never mind that just now; let uspretend that thisispossible. My present point is that suchan intuition wouldn’t take placea priori, i.e. before the objectwas presented to me; for if the object were not present, therewould be nothing that connected my representation—·myintuition·—in any way with that object in particular.There’s only one way to have an intuition that precedesthe reality of the object, and thus occurs asa prioriknowl-17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?edge. I could have such an intuition if it contained nothingbut theform of my sensibility.·My sensibility is my capacityfor being affected by particular real things. Through it I cometo havesensible intuitions. In any such transaction with anobject, the faculty of sensibility makes its own contribution;the intuitions that occur in my mind depend not only on•what the objects are like but also on•the characteristicmarks left on them by my faculty of sensibility; these con-stitute itsform·. The form of my sensibility is availableto me in advance of any of the impressions in which I amaffected by objects.·That’s because I know in advance that,whatever my particular experience turns out to be like, itwill reflect the form of my sensibility; which is to say that·Ican knowa priorithat I can intuit objects of the senses onlyin accordance with this form of sensibility. It follows•thatthere can be,·and we can know·, propositions that concernmerely this form of sensibility,•that such propositions arevalid for objects of the senses, and•that they can’t be appliedto anything except objects of our senses.10Thus it is only through the form of sensible intuition[=‘form of sensibility’]that we can intuit thingsa priori. Suchaprioriknowledge, however, concerns objects only as theyappear to us through our senses, and not as they may be inthemselves. Ifa prioriknowledge of synthetic propositions isto be possible, and we are to understand how it is possible,it must be subject to this·limitation to how things•appearas distinct from how they•are in themselves·.Now, space and time are the two intuitions on which puremathematics bases all its judgments that present themselvesas certain and necessary. Pure mathematics mustconstructits concepts on the basis of pure intuition,·i.e. the kind ofintuition that is conducteda priori, with no reliance on thesenses·. Mathematics can’t proceed analytically by dissectingconcepts, but only synthetically; so without pure intuition itcan’t take a single step, since only pure intuition providesthe material for synthetica priorijudgments. Geometry isbased on the pure intuition ofspace. Arithmetic forms itsown concepts of numbers by successively adding units intime. Our representations of space and time are merelyintuitions, however,·rather than concepts·; and here is why.Start with empirical intuitions of bodies and their changes,and strip them of everything empirical—i.e. everything youknow about them through sensation—and what you are leftwith is space and time. These are therefore pure intuitions.They must be involved in all empirical intuitions, and cannever be omitted, because they underlie everything empirical.But just because they are themselves purea prioriintuitions,they must be mereformsof our sensibility. They precedeall our empirical intuition, i.e. all our perceptions of realobjects; through them we can know objectsa priori, thoughindeed only as they appear to us·and not as they are inthemselves·.11That solves the problem about how mathematics is possible.Pure mathematics is possible only because it bears on mereobjects of the senses. The empirical intuition of such objectsis groundeda prioriin a pure intuition of space and time,and this pure intuition is merely the form of our sensibility.It precedes the actual appearance of objects, since it makesit possible for them to appear to us.·Objects can appearto us only through our sensibility; and anything we getthrough our sensibility bears the marks of the form ofsensibility·. Oura prioriintuitions don’t involve thecontentof the appearance, the element ofsensationin it, for thatbelongs to the empirical realm; they involve theformof the18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?appearance, namely space and time. If you suspect thatspace and time are features of things in themselves ratherthan mere features of how things relate to sensibility, thentell me: How in that case could we knowa priori—in advanceof any experience of things—what the intuitions of space andtime must be like? Yet we do know this. There’s no problemabout this knowledge so long as space and time are takento be nothing more than formal conditions of our sensibility,and the objects are taken to be merely appearances. Forthen the pure intuition that embodies the form of sensibilitycan be understood as coming fromus—fromourside of thetransaction with objects—which means that it can be hadapriorirather than empirically.12To clarify and confirm all this, we need only to look at howgeometers do (and absolutely must) go about proving thattwo figures are completely congruent, meaning that one canbe replaced at all points by the other. All such proofs ulti-mately come down to this:The two figures coincide with eachother; which is obviously a synthetic proposition resting onimmediate intuition. This intuition must be given pure andapriori, otherwise the proposition couldn’t hold as absolutelycertain and necessary. If it rested on an empirical intuition,it would only have empirical certainty, and would mean:So far as our experience has shown us, this proposition hashelduntil now. That space has three dimensions, and thatno space could have more, is built on the proposition thatnot more than three lines can intersect at right angles in apoint. This proposition can’t be shown from concepts, butrests immediately on intuition, and indeed (because it isnecessary and certain), on purea prioriintuition. That a linecan be drawn to infinity, or a series of changes continuedto infinity, presupposes a representation of space and timeas not bounded by anything; and this can only come fromintuition, and could never be inferred from concepts. Thusmathematics is really grounded in purea prioriintuitions;they are what enable it to establish synthetic propositionsas necessary and certain.[In this paragraph Kant speaks of a certain ‘transcendental deduc-tion’ of certain concepts. A ‘deduction’ is a theoretically grounded orjustifiedlist; it is ‘transcendental’ in Kant’s main sense of that word ifit is based on considerations about what makes some kind ofa prioriknowledgepossible]. Hence our transcendental deduction ofthe concepts of space and time—·i.e. our establishing thatwhatever is given to us in experiencemustbe in space andin time·—also explains the possibility of pure mathematics.If we didn’t have such a deduction, and couldn’t take itfor granted thatwhatever is presented our senses—whetherouter (space) or inner (time)—is experienced by us only as itappears, not as it is in itself, we could stilldomathematicsbut we wouldn’t have any insight into what it is.13If you can’t help thinking that space and time are real quali-ties attached to things in themselves, try your intelligence onthe following paradox. When it has defeated you, you maybe free from prejudices at least for a few moments, and thenyou may be more favourably disposed towards the view thatspace and time are mere forms of our sensible intuition.If two things are completely the same in every respectof quantity and quality that can be known about eachseparately, you would expect it to follow that each can bereplaced by the other in all cases and in all respects, withoutthe exchange causing any recognizable difference. Thatisthecase with two-dimensional figures in geometry, but not withthree-dimensional ones: it can happen that two of them havea complete inner agreement yet also have an outer relation19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?such that one can’t be replaced by the other. . . . What canbe more like my hand, and more equal in all points, than itsimage in the mirror? Yet I can’t put such a hand as is seen inthe mirror in the place of its original: for if the original wasa right hand, the hand in the mirror is a left hand, whichcould never serve as a substitute for the other. Here are noinner differences that any understanding could think—·thatis, no differences that can be expressed in concepts·—andyet the differences are inner as far as the senses tell us, forthe left hand can’t be enclosed in the same boundaries as theright (they aren’t congruent), despite all their equality andsimilarity. For example, the glove of one hand can’t be usedon the other. So the two hands are intrinsically different ina manner that can’t be captured in concepts—it can onlybeshownthrough the fact that a spatial region that exactlycontains one won’t contain the other.How can this be? Well, these objects are not representa-tions of the things as they are in themselves, but are sensibleintuitions, i.e. appearances, which come about throughthe relation to•our sensibility of•certain things that areunknown in themselves. When this sensibility is exercisedasouterintuition, its form isspace; and the intrinsic natureof any region of space is fixed by how that region relates tospace as a whole, the one big space of which it is a part.(The part is made possible by the whole:·a small regionof space can exist only if there’s a larger region of which itis a part·. This never happens with things in themselves,but it can happen with mere appearances.) Thus, to makeintelligible to ourselves the difference between similar andequal yet incongruent things (e.g. snails winding oppositeways), we must relate them to the right and the left hand.That means that it must be done through intuition; it can’tbe done through any concept.·That is, it must be done byshowing, and can’t be done bytelling·.Note IThe propositions of geometry aren’t mere fantasies that mighthave nothing to do with real objects. Pure mathematics, andin particular pure geometry, is objectively valid, but onlyin application to objects of the senses. When we representsuch objects through our sensibility, we represent them notas they are in themselves but only as they appear to us.So theymusthave any features that are conferred on themby the form of our sensibility—and in particular they mustbe in space, because space is simply the form of all outerappearances. Outer appearances are possible only throughsensibility, the form of which is the basis for geometry; soouter appearances must conform to what geometry saysabout them.If the senses had to represent objects as they are inthemselves, the situation would be quite different. For thenthe facts about our representation of space would provide noguarantee about how things are in reality. The space of thegeometer—a mere representation—would be a fiction with noobjective validity, for there would be no reason why thingsshould have to conform to the picture that we make of themin advance of being acquainted with them. But if•this picture, or rather this formal intuition, comesfrom the essential nature of our sensibility, throughwhich objects must be given to us,and if•what this sensibility represents aren’t things in them-selves but only their appearances,it then becomes conceivable—indeed undeniable—that•all outer objects of the world of the senses must agreeexactly with the propositions of geometry.It is a remarkable fact that at one time mathematicianswho were also philosophers began to have doubts about20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?their geometrical propositions—not about whether they weretrue ofspace, but about they held good in application tonature, that is tothings in space. They feared that a line innature might consist of physical points, in which case thespace of the natural object would consists of simple parts,although the space the geometer thinks about can’t be likethat.·That is, they feared that the space of natural objectsmight not be infinitely divisible, and might instead be madeup of atoms of space, so to speak; whereas geometrical spaceis infinitely divisible·. They didn’t realize that the spatiality ofouter thingsmustexactly conform to the space the geometerthinks about, because:•all objects in space are mere appearances, i.e. notthings in themselves but representations of our sensi-ble intuition; and•the space the geometer thinks about—space inthought, we might call it—is just a form of our facultyof sensible representation.·Putting these two together: an outer thing must be givento us through our sensibility, so it must conform to theform—the essential nature—of our sensibility, so it mustobey the propositions of geometry·. This is the only wayto defend the objective validity of geometrical propositionsagainst shallow metaphysical attacks. . . .Note IIAnything that is to be presented to us as an object must begiven in intuition. But all our intuition happens throughthe senses—the understanding doesn’t intuit anything. Now,we have just seen that the senses nevereverenable us toknow things as they are in themselves; all we encounterthrough the senses are the appearances of things; and theseappearances are mere representations of sensibility. Whatfollows is this:All bodies, along with the space that containsthem, are merely representations in us, and exist only in ourthoughts.‘Isn’t this blatant idealism?’·No, it is not, and Inow explain why·. Idealism says this:Only minds exist, and the other things we thinkwe perceive are only representations in us, with noexternal object corresponding to them.I say the contrary:Things are given to us as objects of our senses, exist-ing outside us, but we know nothing of what they arein themselves; all we know are their appearances, i.e.the representations they cause in us by affecting oursenses.So I say that therearebodies outside us—i.e. things of whosenature in themselves we know nothing, knowing them onlythrough our representations of them. We call such a thing a‘body’, meaning ‘the appearance to us of an unknown thingwhich is nevertheless real’. Can this be called idealism? It isthe very opposite of it!Long before Locke’s time, but more so afterwards, itwas generally accepted that although outer things are per-fectly real, many of their properties belong not to things inthemselves but only to their appearances. These properties,including heat, colour, taste etc., were agreed to have no ex-istence of their own outside our representations. I go further.I countalsoas mere appearances the remaining qualitiesof bodies—the ‘primary’ qualities of extension, place, andspace in general with all that depends on it (impenetrabilityor materiality, shape, etc.). I have weighty reasons for thisview, and there isn’t the slightest reason to reject it. A manwho holds that•colours are aspects of the sense of sight andnot qualities of the object in itself should not on that accountbe called an idealist. So I should not be called idealist either,merely because I hold that•allthe qualities that make up21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?the intuition of a body belong merely to its appearance. Thisdoctrine of mine doesn’t destroy the existence of the thingthat appears, as genuine idealism does; it merely says thatwe can’t through our senses know the thing as it is in itself.What would I have to say to stop people from accusingme of idealism? It wouldn’t be enough for me to say:Our representations of outer objects are perfectlyappropriate, given how our sensibility relates to thoseobjects;for that’s what Ihavesaid·and still the accusations con-tinue·. I would also have to say:Our representations of outer objects are exactlylikethe objects themselves.But that, to me, makes as little sense as the assertion thatthe sensation of red islikethe property of the pigment thatcauses this sensation in me.Note III‘When you admit the ideality of space and time, you turnthe whole world of the senses into pure illusion’—it is easyto foresee that this complaint will be levelled, and easy toshow, from what I have said, that it is futile. At first allphilosophical insight into the nature of knowledge throughthe senses was tainted by taking sensibility to be a mode ofrepresentation which, though confused, lets us know thingsas they arewithout our being able to get the whole contentof this representationclearin our minds.·Replacing thatdisastrous mistake·, I showed•that sensibility has to be un-derstood in terms not of thislogicalclear/obscure distinctionbut of somethinggenetic, having to do with where knowledgecomes from—sense-perception represents things not as theyare but only the mode in which they affect our senses—andconsequently•that what sense-perception provides for theunderstanding to think about areappearancesonly, notthings themselves. Now that I have given this necessarycorrective, it would be an unpardonable misunderstanding—almost adeliberateone—to say that my doctrine turns allthe contents of the world of the senses into pure illusion.When an•appearance is given to us, it is up to us tochoose how to•judge the matter. The•appearance dependson the senses, but the•judgment depends on the under-standing, and the only question is whether a given judgmentistrueor not. But the difference between truth and dream-ing isn’t ascertained by•the nature of the representationsin question (fortheyare the same whether or not one isdreaming), but by•their inter-connections according to therules that bring representations together under the conceptof an object and settle whether or not they can co-exist ina single experience. And it isn’t the appearances’ doing ifour mind takes illusion for truth, i.e. if it takes theintuitionthrough which we are given an object to be aconceptof thething or even to be the thing itself—these being items that theunderstandingcanthink·but thesensescan’tpresent·. Thesenses represent the planets to us as moving backwardsand forwards, and in this there’s neither falsehood nortruth, because as long as we take this·planetary·path tobe nothing but appearance, we make no judgment aboutthe objective nature of the planets’ movements. But whenthe understanding isn’t on its guard against this subjectiverepresentation’s being taken to be objective, a false judgmentcan easily arise—‘They seem to be moving backward’, wemay say. The illusion mustn’t be charged to•the senses,however, but to•the understanding, whose job it is to renderan objective judgment on the basis of the appearances.Thus, even if we gave no thought to where our represen-tations come from, when we connect our sensory intuitions(whatever their content) in space and in time, according to22"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?the rules governing the way all knowledge hangs togetherin experience, we will encounterillusionif we are negligentandtruthif we are careful. The difference between illusionand truth turns on how sensory representations are handledin the understanding, not on where they come from. In thesame way, if I•take all the representations of the senses to be nothingbut appearances,•take space and time also to be appearances and asa mereformof sensibility that isn’t to be met withoutside its borders, and•use these representations only in relation to possibleexperience,then my regarding them as appearances won’t involve me inthe slightest temptation to think in terms of error or illusion;for appearances can hang together according to rules oftruth in experience.·Whether they do so hang together issomething I can determine without bringing in their ultimatestatus, i.e. the question of whether space and its contents areappearances·. That’s how all the propositions of geometryhold good for space as well as for all the objects of the sensesand consequently of all possible experience, whether I•takespace to be a mere form of the sensibility or•regard it assomething that clings the things themselves; though it isonly in the former case that I can grasp how I can knowapriorithat these propositions are true of all the objects ofexternal intuition. Apart from that one matter of knowinghow geometry can be knowna priori, all my dealings withspace and its contents are just what they would have been ifI hadn’t departed from the common view.But there’s a way in which an errorcouldarise. If Ipass off space and time as qualities inherent in things inthemselves, there will be nothing to stop me from thinkingthat those two concepts would hold good for the same thingsthat they now apply to even if my senses were differentand couldn’t present those things to me; and so I shall beled to venture to carry my notions of space and time outbeyond all possible experience; and then I can fall victim toan illusion that would generate a grave error, namely that ofpassing off asvalid for everythingsomething that is merelya subjective condition of the intuition of things andvalidonly for all objects of sense, i.e. for all possible experience. Iwould be led into this error by thinking of space and time ascontaining•things in themselves, rather than as restrictingthem to the•conditions of experience.So my doctrine of the ideality of space and of time·(i.e.my doctrine that space and time are appearances) comesnowhere near to turning the whole world of the sensesinto mere illusion. I shall offer two graphic illustrationsof this. Firstly, the doctrine·is so far from•turning thesensible worldintoillusion that it is the only means of•saving somethingfrombeing regarded as mere illusion;what it saves is one of the most important kinds of knowledge(the kind that mathematics propoundsa priori), which thedoctrine guarantees does apply to actual objects.·Here iswhy it is the only way of securing this result·. Without theideality of space and time it would be quite impossible todecide whether the intuitions of space and time—which wedon’t takefromany experience, and which nevertheless liein our representationsa priori·so that we take themtoeveryexperience·—aren’t mere phantoms thrown up by our brain,with nothing adequately corresponding to them, in whichcase geometry itself is a mere illusion; whereas wehavebeenable to prove geometry’s unquestionable validity with respectto all the objects of the sensible world, just because they aremere appearances.Secondly, it is so far from being the case that these princi-ples of mine turn the truth of experience into mere·sensory23"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure mathematics possible?illusion·by making appearances of the representations of thesenses, that they are rather the only means of preventing thetranscendental illusionby which metaphysics has hithertobeen deceived, leading to an infantile snatching at bubblesby metaphysicians who took appearances—which are mererepresentations—to be things in themselves.[By ‘transcen-dental illusion’ Kant here means something like ‘abstract philosophicalillusion’. His more special sense of ‘transcendental’, explained near theend of section 12, will come up again in the next paragraph.]Thatillusion is what brought on stage the remarkableantinomy[=‘contradiction’]of reasonthat I shall return to in sections 51–3.All it takes to clear up this·internal contradiction into whichreason falls·is a single observation: that appearance, as longas it is employed in experience, produces truth, but as soonas it goes beyond bounds of experience and consequentlybecomes transcendent[= ‘freed from any constraints having to dowith the senses’; not the same as ‘transcendental’ in either of the latter’ssenses], it produces nothing but illusion.Thus, in letting things as we confront them throughthe senses retain their actuality, and limiting our sensoryintuition of these things only by saying this:In no respect—not even in the pure intuitions ofspace and of time—do they represent anything morethan mere appearance of those things, never theirconstitution in themselves,I am not imputing to nature a sweeping illusion.[For thephrase ‘pure intuition’, see the explanation on pages 9–9.]My rejectionof all such imputations is so obviously valid and convincingthat one might think there was no need for it. And therewouldn’t be, if it weren’t for the existence of incompetentjudges who—liking to have an old name for everythingthat diverges from their own wrong-headed though commonopinions, and always clinging to theletterof what is saidwith no thought for itsspirit—are ready to deform and distortwell-defined notions by putting their own follies in the placeof them. I have myself given this theory of mine the name•‘transcendental idealism’, but that can’t entitle anyone tomuddle it either with the•empirical idealism of Descartesor with the•mystical and visionary idealism of Berkeley.(My critique·of pure reason·contains the proper antidote tophantoms like Berkeley’s. As for Descartes: all he had was aninsoluble problem, which led him to think that everyone is atliberty to deny the existence of the corporeal world because itcould never be proved satisfactorily.) Doubting the existenceof things constitutes ‘idealism’ in the ordinary sense; butthe doctrine I have labelled as ‘idealism’—·in the phrase‘transcendental idealism’·—doesn’t concern the existenceof things, since it never entered my head to doubt thatthey exist. Rather, it concerns the sensory representationof things, especially of space and time. All I have shownregarding space and time, and thus more generally regardingall appearances, is that they aren’t•things but mere•featuresof how we represent things, and aren’t qualities of thingsin themselves. But the word ‘transcendental’ was meant toguard against this misconception. (For me, ‘transcendental’signifies a reference to our knowledge not•of things butonly•of our ability to have knowledge.·I characterized myidealism as ‘transcendental’ because it offers an explanationofhow we can knowcertain thingsa priori·.) But ratherthan furthering the misunderstanding, I now retract thelabel ‘transcendental’ and ask that my idealism be called‘critical’. But if it really is an objectionable idealism to convertactual things (not appearances) into mere representations, bywhat name shall we call the idealism that goes the oppositeway and changes mere representations into things? It may,I think, be called ‘dreaming idealism’, in contrast to theformer, which may be called ‘visionary’. Both are refuted bymy transcendental idealism—or, better,criticalidealism.24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?Main transcendental problem 2:How is pure natural science possible?14·The word ‘nature’ has two senses. I shall use it in what Ishall later call its ‘formal’ sense in this section and the next;and then in section 16 I shall start to use ‘nature’ in what Icall its ‘material’ sense. Both will be in play in section 36·.Nature is the existence of things insofar as it is governed byuniversal·causal·laws. If this meant the existence of thingsin themselves,we couldn’t know nature either•a priorior•aposteriori.·One way of knowing thingsa prioriis knowingthem through the analysis of concepts·. We couldn’t knownatureas it is in itselfin that way, because knowledge ofwhat things are like in themselves can never come fromanalytically dissecting our concepts: we aren’t asking whatis containedinour concept of the thing, but rather aboutwhat isaddedto this concept in the reality of the thing itself.·Some synthetic propositions can be knowna prioribecausetheir truth is assured by the nature of our understanding,somewhat in the way that mathematical truths can be knowna prioribecause our sensibility assures their truth. But thisis also not applicable to the supposed ‘knowledge of nature asit is in itself’, which we are discussing·. My understanding·has an effect on how thingsappearto me, but it·can’tdictate what things are likein themselves. They don’t have toconform to it; so if I am to know about things in themselves,my understanding must conform to them,·not vice versa·.That means that I couldn’t know about them until theyhad somehow been presented to me; which is to say that Icouldn’t know thema priori.Nor could I havea posterioriknowledge—·i.e. knowledgethrough experience·—of the nature of things in themselves.If I am to bring things under·causal·laws, these laws mustapply to themnecessarily, and experience could never showme how things must be—only what there is and how it is. Soit can never teach me the nature of things in themselves.15Yet we do have pure natural science, which discoversa prioricertain laws that govern all of nature, and discovers them tobe necessary. One part of it is what we call ‘general naturalscience’, which is a preliminary to empirical physics. In thiswe find•mathematics applied to appearances·on the basis of•intuition·, and also•conceptual principles that make up the•philosophical part of pure knowledge of nature.·A coupleof qualifications should be mentioned·.•It isn’t strictly pure,because there are things in it that are based on experience,such as the concepts ofmotion, ofimpenetrability, ofinertia.•Nor is it ‘general’ in the strictest sense, because it concernsonly the objects of the outer senses, whereas a truly generalnatural science would apply laws to the whole of nature—notonly outer objects (physics) but also inner ones (psychology).Still, some principles of this general physics are strictlyuniversal, for instance the propositions ‘Substance is perma-nent’ and ‘Everything that happens is determined by a causeaccording to constant laws’. These really are universal lawsof nature that we can knowa priori. So pure natural sciencedoes exist, and we have to ask: How is it possible?16I now want to use the word ‘nature’ in a broader sense, itsmaterial sense, in which it refers to·every aspect of·•thetotality of all objects of·possible·experience, i.e. the whole25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?perceivable world. Up to this point I have been using ‘nature’in its narrower sense, making it refer only to•the way allthings fall under the system of laws.Theperceivableworld is all we have to concern ourselveswith. If we tried to learn about things thatcouldn’tbe objectsof experience, we would have to think about them throughconcepts that couldn’t be illustrated or cashed out in termsof any possible experience. Such concepts would be empty;we·could play around with them in our minds, but·wecould never know whether they applied to anything ratherthan being mere fictions contrived by us. Knowledge ofsomething that couldn’t be an object of experience wouldbe supernatural·in the quite literal sense of being abovenature·, and the supernatural is no part of our presentconcern. The knowledge that we care about is the sortwhich, although it•precedes experience·rather than•arisingout of it·, can•be confirmed by experience.17It has just been shown that the laws of nature can never beknowna prioriof objects considered in themselves (ratherthan in terms of possible experience of them). But we aren’tconcerned here with things in themselves; their propertiesdon’t interest us. Our concern is with things considered asobjects of a possible experience, and the totality of thesethings is what we here call ‘nature’ in the broad sense. Now,we are going to enquire into what enables us to havea prioriknowledge of nature, and we have to choose between twoways of framing our problem.•How can we knowa priorithat experience itself mustconform to law?•How can we knowa priorithat things (considered asobjects of experience) must conform to law?The two questions turn out to be equivalent. The laws thatgovern our•ways of knowing also govern•the objects thatwe know, as long as these are considered as objects ofexperience and not as they are in themselves. There aretwo things we can say:(1)A judgment of perception can’t count as valid forex-perienceunless the mind in which it occurs conformsto the following law: When any event is observed tohappen, it is connected with some earlier event that itfollows according to a universal rule.(2)Everything that we experience as happening must becaused to happen.It makes no difference which we say: they come down to thesame thing.Still, we’ll do better if we start with(1). We can makeaprioridiscoveries about what the conditions are under whichexperience is possible, but we can’t make such discoveriesabout laws that apply to things in themselves independentlyof our experience of them. So our only way of studying•thenature of thingsa prioriis by studying•the conditions underwhich experience is possible, including the universal lawsof the mind that make it possible.·What I am saying, ineffect, is that we should tackle(2)bytackling(1)·. If I choseto start with(2), I would risk falling into error by imaginingthat I was talking about naturein itself. That would set mewhirling around in endless circles, trying in vain to discoverlaws governing things that aren’tgivento me·as things aregivento me in experience·.So our only concern here will be with experience and withwhat universal conditions have to be satisfied for experienceto be possible—conditions that we can know abouta priori.On that basis we are to establish the characteristics ofnature as the whole object of all possible experience. Youwill understand, I think, that I am not talking about•rulesthat we learn by observing a nature that is already given,26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?for such rules already presuppose experience; so I am nottalking about how through experience we can study the lawsof nature, for laws learned in that way wouldn’t be lawsapriori, and wouldn’t supply us with apurenatural science.Rather, my topic is the question of how•the conditions thatwe can knowa priorihave to be satisfied if experience is tobe possible are at the same time•the sources from which allthe universal laws of nature must be derived.18The first thing to make clear is this: although alljudgments ofexperienceareempirical(i.e. have their ground in immediatesense-perception), the converse doesn’t hold: not all empiri-cal judgments are judgments of experience. That’s becausea judgment of experience must contain more than merelyan empirical component, given through sensory•intuition.It must also involve particular•concepts that·don’t comefrom sense-experience, but·originatea prioriin the pureunderstanding—concepts under which every•perceptionmust first be brought and then by means of them changedinto•experience.Empirical judgments fall into two kinds:•judgmentsof experience and•judgments of perception. The formerare objectively valid. They are based on immediate senseperception, but theyaddto it: when something is givento sensible intuition, a•judgment of experience applies toit certain special concepts that pure understanding givesrise to, completely independently of experience.Perceptionsare turned intoexperienceby being brought under theseconcepts.•Judgments of perception are only subjectivelyvalid: all they need is that the perceptions hang togetherin the right way in mind of the person concerned (thesubject); they don’t involve any of the pure concepts of theunderstanding.All our judgments start out by being judgments of per-ception, and thus as valid only for us (i.e. for oursubject).Later on we make them refer to anobject, and mean themto be valid for all people and for ourselves at all times. Ajudgment’s being about an object connects with its beinguniversally valid, and the connection runs both ways. On theone hand: if my judgment is about an object, then anyoneelse’s judgment about that same object should agree withmine, which is to say that mine must be universally valid.On the other hand: if a judgment of mine is universally valid,agreeing with the judgments of all others, this agreement hasto be explained. The explanation must be that the judgmentsagree with one another because they all refer to the sameobject.19So something’s being true of an object is equivalent to itshaving to be the same for everyone:•objective validity and•necessary universal validity stand or fall together. Whenwe regard a judgment as universally valid and necessary,we mean by this that it is objectively valid, even though wedon’t know the object in itself. We know the object throughthis judgment—i.e. through the judgment that anyone whohas perceptions of kind F with respect to the objectmustalso have perceptions of kind G. So judgments of experienceget their objective validity not from immediate knowledge ofthe object but from how perceptions are connected with oneanother; and these connections come not from anything em-pirical but from pure concepts of the understanding.·Theycan’t have an empirical basis because they involve necessity;the judgments in question say that certain perceptionsmustbe associated with certain others; and experience nevertells us what must be the case·. The object in itself alwaysremains unknown; but it gives us perceptions through our27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?sensibility, and these are connected; and when a concept ofthe understanding settles it that the connection is universallyvalid, the result is an objective judgment—something thatdoesn’t merely report on perceptions but says things aboutan object.Here is an illustration. That the room is warm, sugaris sweet, wormwood is nasty, are merely subjectively validjudgments.1·In making such judgments·, I don’t expectthat I shall find the room to be warm or sugar sweet orwormwood nasty at all times, or that everyone else will findthem to be so. All that such a judgment does is to connecttwo sensations to a single subject (myself) at a particulartime; they aren’t intended to be valid of the object. I callthem judgments ofperception. Matters are quite differentwith judgments ofexperience. What experience teaches meunder certain circumstances it must teach me and everybodyalways; its validity isn’t limited to one person or one time;so its judgments are objectively valid. For example, whenI say thatair is elastic, this starts out as a judgment of•perception, which merely connects two of my sensations toone another. But if I mean it as a judgment of•experience,I require that this connection be universally valid, i.e. thatI and everybody must always conjoin the same sensationsunder the same circumstances.20So experience is a product of the senses and of the under-standing, and we have to discover how these two facultiescombine to produce it. One of them is simply intuition ofwhich I am conscious, i.e. perception, which belongs merelyto the senses. The second element that goes into experienceis judging, which belongs entirely to the understanding.There are two kinds of judging.(1)I may merely compareperceptions and conjoin them ina consciousness of mystate.(2)I may conjoin them inconsciousness in general.What I have in(1)is merely a judgment of perception, asubjectively valid connecting of perceptions in my mind,without reference to an object. People often think that allyou need for experience is to compare perceptions and toconnect them in your consciousness by means of judgmentsabout them; but they are wrong. That procedure doesn’tlead to judgments that are universally valid and necessary,and that’s what is needed for objective validity and for realexperience.To turn perception into experience, therefore, we need(2)a different kind of judging. An intuition (or perception) mustbe brought under a purea prioriconcept of the understand-ing; this concept settles what kind or form of judgment canbe made about this intuition; thus it connects the individualperson’s intuition with a frame of mind that•anyone mustbe in when making judgments about such intuitions; and inthis way it provides the empirical judgments with•universalvalidity. Such a concept, I repeat, merely fixes a general wayin which judgments can be brought to bear on the intuition.It might be the concept ofcause, for instance. To bring thisto bear on one’s intuition (or perception) of air, for example,is to be disposed to make hypothetical judgments of the form‘If air is compressed, then. . . ’.Before a judgment of perception can become a judgmentof experience, the perception must be brought under such aconcept of the understanding—as when air is brought under1Actually,thesejudgments of perception could never become judgments of experience, even if a concept of the understanding were added. They refermerely to feeling, which is incurably subjective and can never become objective. Still, they serve my immediate purpose of illustrating judgmentsthat are merely subjectively valid, involving no relation to an object. In the next footnote I shall give an example of judgments of perception thatcanbecome judgments of experience.28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?the concept of cause, yielding judgments of the form ‘If airis. . . , then. . . ’. The judgment that air is elastic can becomeuniversally valid, and thus be turned into a judgment ofexperience, because of certain preliminary judgments thatbring the intuition of air under the concept ofcause andeffect. (An easier example is: ‘When the sun shines onthe stone, it grows warm.’ This is a mere judgment ofperception and contains no necessity, no matter how oftenI and others may have perceived this. But if I say ‘The sunwarms the stone’,·which means that the suncausesthestone to become warm·, the concept ofcauseis added to theperception and connects the concept of warmth necessarilywith the concept of sunshine.)If all our objectively valid synthetic judgments are anal-ysed, it turns out that they never consist in mere intuitionsthat are brought together in a judgment through mere com-parison. Always, a pure concept of the understanding hasbeen added to the concepts that are abstracted from intuition.This applies even to the judgments of pure mathematics,including its simplest axioms. The principle ‘A straight lineis the shortest path between two points’ presupposes thatthe line has been brought under the concept ofsize. Thatconcept doesn’t come from intuition; it has its seat solelyin the understanding, and serves to get the intuition (of theline) ready for quantitative judgments to be made about it.21If we are to prove that experience is possible insofar as itrests on purea prioriconcepts of the understanding, weneed a•list of these concepts. We arrive at this list through a•list of basic kinds of judgments that we can make, becausethe pure concepts of the understanding run parallel to thosejudgment kinds. . . .Logical table of judgments12QUANTITYQUALITYUniversalAffirmativeParticularNegativeSingularInfinite34RELATIONMODALITYCategoricalProblematicHypotheticalAssertoricDisjunctiveApodicticTable of concepts of the understanding12QUANTITYQUALITYUnity (measure)RealityPlurality (size)NegationTotality (whole)Limitation34RELATIONMODALITYSubstancePossibilityCauseExistenceCausal interactionNecessity29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?Pure physical table of the universal principles of natural science12Axioms of IntuitionAnticipations of Perception34Analogies of ExperiencePostulates of empirical thinking generally* * * * *21aIf we are to grasp all this in a single thought, I must firstremind you that our topic isn’twhere experience comes frombutwhat experience contains. The former topic belongs toempirical psychology, though even that wouldn’t sufficewithout the latter topic, which belongs to the critique ofknowledge and especially of the understanding.Experience consists of intuitions, which belong to thesensibility, and of judgments, which are entirely a work of theunderstanding. But the•judgments that the understandingforms from sensory intuitions alone are not•judgments ofexperience. They merely connect the perceptions as givenin sensory intuition, while a judgment of experience mustexpress•what is contained in experience in general, andnot merely•what is contained in the mere perception (whichhas only subjective validity). So a judgment of experiencemust•add something to•the sensuous intuition and•thelogical tie-up of that intuition to others in a judgment (afterit has been made universal by comparing·this intuition withothers·). It must•add something implying that the syntheticjudgment isnecessaryand therefore universally valid—·notmerely universal in the weak way that comes from comparingintuitions with one another·. This added element can onlybe the concept that represents the intuition as a suitablesubject for one form of judgment rather than another.22Summing up: The business of the senses is to intuit; thatof the understanding, to think. Now, thinking is unifyingrepresentations in a consciousness, and this can be doneeither in•a contingent and subjective way or in•a mannerthat is necessary and objective. Since thinking is the sameas judging, it follows that judgments are of two kinds: ajudgment may be merely•subjective (when representations are inter-relatedonly with respect to one person’s consciousness),or it may be•objective (when the representations are related withrespect to consciousness in general, i.e. with respectto every possible conscious mind).The basic kinds of judgment are simplypossible ways ofunifying representations in a consciousness; and when theyserve as concepts, they are concepts of thenecessaryunifica-30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?tion of representations inanyconsciousness, which meansthat the judgments that involve them are objectively valid.In experience, perceptions are synthetically but necessarilyconnected in a consciousness; for them to be connected inthis manner, they must be brought under pure concepts ofthe understanding; so these concepts are required if anyjudgments of experience are to be made.223•Judgments can be seen as ways of unifying representationsin a consciousness. Looked at in this way, they are•rules.When they represent the perceptions as necessarily united,they area priorirules; and when they stand on their own feet,not being derived from something more fundamental, theycan be called ‘principles’. The broad kinds of judgment thatbring intuitions under pure concepts of the understandingaren’t derived from anything; they stand on their own feet.So they’re thea prioriprinciples of possible experience.Now the•principles of possible experience are at the sametime•universal laws of nature, which can be knowna priori.This solves the problem raised by our second question, ‘Howis pure natural science possible?’ Here is how. Logic offersus only one set of basic kinds of judgment (and thus oneset of basic rules); no other is possible. These constitutealogical system. The concepts that emerge from it, whichmake synthetic necessary judgments possible, constituteatranscendental system[meaning, roughly, ‘a system that has todo with grounds fora prioriknowledge’.]And, lastly, the princi-ples according to which these concepts are applied to allappearances constitute aphysical system, i.e. a system ofnature. This system precedes all empirical knowledge ofnature, and is what first makes such knowledge possible; soit can properly be calleduniversal and pure natural science.24Of the physical principles listed in section 21, the first bringsall phenomena, as intuitions in space and time, under theconcept ofquantity, which makes it a principle governingthe application ofmathematicsto experience. The secondprinciple takes up the genuinely empirical element, namelysensation, which signifies what is real in intuitions. It doesn’tbring sensation directly under the concept of quantity, be-cause sensation isn’t an intuition thatcontainseither spaceor time, though it places the sensed object in both spaceand time. But still there’s a quantifiable difference betweensense-representation and a total absence of intuition in time,the difference betweenrealityandzero. For we can conceiveof intermediate degrees separatingany given degree of•light from darkness,any degree of•heat from absolute cold,any degree of•weight from absolute lightness,any degree of•fullness of space from total vacuum;2But how does this proposition thatJudgments of experience require that perceptions be brought togethernecessarilysquare with my often-madestatement thatExperience as a posteriori knowledge can only providecontingentjudgments?When I say that experience teaches me something, Imean only that I learn something from the perception that liesinexperience—for example, thatHeat always follows the shining of the sun on a stone—and to that extent the proposition of experience is always accidental·or contingent·. The proposition thatThis heatnecessarilyfollows the shining of the sunis indeed containedinthe judgment of experience (by means of the concept of cause), but it is not a fact learnedfromexperience. On the contrary,this addition of the concept of cause to perception is what creates experience in the first place.31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?just as there are intermediate degrees—as small as youlike—separating•consciousness from total unconsciousness (psycho-logical darkness).So there’s no perception that can prove an absolute absence;for instance, there’s no psychological darkness that can’tbe considered as a kind of consciousness, which is merelyrelatively dark, by comparison with some other strongerconsciousness—and that’s how it is in all cases of sensation.Sensation is what gives each empirical representation (eachappearance) its own particular flavour.·It might be thoughtto be allcontent, with noform, and so not to be somethingthat the understanding could say anything about in advance·.But the account I have been giving shows how the under-standing can•anticipate even sensations—·i.e.•say some-thing about them in advance of their actually occurring·—bymeans of the principleEvery sensation has a degree, fromwhich it follows that what’s real in all phenomena has adegree. This is the second application of mathematics tonatural science.·In discussing those two (sets of) principles of naturalscience, I have been implicitly discussing the corresponding(sets of) concepts, listed just before the list of principles insection 21. In the next section I shall take up the other twosets of concepts, and their associated principles·.25In the table of the concepts of the understanding, one ofthe headings is Relation. This refers not to mathematicalrelations, but rather to dynamic ones (relations having to dowith how things exist in time).·Firstly·, appearances must bebrought under the concept of•substance; this is the conceptof athing, and any judgment about what exists must involveit. Secondly, when appearances involve events following oneanother in time, they must be brought under the conceptof•cause and effect. Thirdly, judgments of experience aboutthings that exist together must involve the concept of•two-way causal interaction.[Kant’s word for this isGemeinschaft, whichis usually but unhelpfully translated by ‘community’.]Thusa prioriprinciples are involved in objectively valid though empiricaljudgments; they are needed if we are to have real experience,which connects objects in nature. These principles are thereal laws of nature, and can be called ‘dynamic’.Finally, judgments of experience include·ones express-ing·knowledge of correspondences and connections; buttheir topic isn’t how appearances relate toone anotherin experience, but rather how they relate toexperience ingeneral. This has to do with•whether they satisfy the formal conditions that theunderstanding recognizes,or with•whether they fit with the materials of the senses andof perception,orit•brings both of those considerations together undera single concept.So it has to do with•possibility,•actuality, and•necessityaccording to universal laws of nature.26My third table·on page 30·—the table of principles that thecritical method has extracted from the nature of the under-standing itself—has acompletenessthat raises it far aboveevery other table that anyone ever did or ever will offer in avain attempt to extract principles by non-critical methodsfrom things themselves. What makes my table complete isthis: so far as the understanding is concerned, the essenceof experience lies in the•judgments that can be made about32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?it, and I have used·properties of·the faculty of•judgment asa single guiding rationale for what is included in my table ofprinciples, namelyallthe synthetica prioriprinciples. So wecan be certain that there are no more principles of that sort,and that certainty affords a satisfaction that the dogmaticmethod can never achieve.[Kant’s use of ‘dogmatic’ is explained ina note on page 12.]Yet this is not all: my table of principles hasanother much greater merit·that I shall now explain·.We must carefully bear in mind the premise•that enablesus to infer that there can bea prioriknowledge·such asthe table of principles involves·, and•that at the same timesubjects all such principles to the constraint that they areonly about the conditions of possible experience in generalso far as it conforms to lawsa priori. If we lose sight of thisconstraint, we risk the principles’ being misunderstood, andtheir being extended in use beyond the original sense thatthe understanding attaches to them. So I don’t saythat things in themselves have a quantity,that their actuality has a degree,that their existence has a connection of qualities in asubstance,or the like. Nobody could prove any of those propositions, be-cause they are synthetic—·connecting things with quantity,degree-of-actuality, and so on·—and it is utterly impossibleto prove such synthetic propositions on the basis of mereconcepts,·because what is proved from mere concepts isalways analytic·. The above propositions have only conceptsto work with, because they purport to be about things inthemselves; that prevents them from referring to how sen-sory intuitions are inter-connected in a possible experience,which is the basis on which synthetic propositions can beproveda priori. So the essential constraint on the conceptsused in these principles is: It is only asobjects of experiencethat things necessarilya priorisatisfy the conditions laiddown in the principles.From this it also follows that the proof of these princi-ples has a unique feature: namely that they aren’t directlyconcerned withappearances and their·inter·-relations, butwiththe possibility of experience. Appearances·on their ownaren’t the whole story; they·constitute only thematterofexperience, not itsform. That is, the principles I’m talkingabout are concerned with objectively and universally validsynthetic propositions, in·the context of·which we distin-guish judgments ofexperiencefrom judgments ofperception.·I shall now add a little detail about how this happens—howthe principles are proved—in connection with three of thefour groups of principles listed on page 30.·(1)·Re the Axioms of Intuition·: Appearances, as mereintuitionsoccupying a part of space and time, come underthe concept of quantity, which can be used in a rule-guidedway in synthetica prioripropositions which generalize overthese intuitions.(2)·Re the Anticipations of Perception·: Insofar as a per-ception contains not only intuition but sensation (whichalways differs from its own total absence by ever-smallerdifferences), the reality of appearances must have a degree.3Small areas of heat and light can be just as great in degree—·that is, just as intense·—as large ones; similarly, brief pains or other states ofconsciousness can be equal in degree·or intensity·to long-lasting ones.·Where degrees of intensity are concerned·, the quantity at a point in spaceand at a moment in time can be just as great as in any space or time of whatever size or duration. So degrees are quantities, but what is quantifiedis not•an intuition but rather•the mere sensation which is the intuition’s content. The only way to measure them, therefore, is through the relationof 1 to 0, that is. by their capability of decreasing by infinite intermediate degrees to disappearance, or of increasing from nothing through infinitegradations to a determinate sensation in a certain time. The quantity of a quality is a degree·of intensity·.33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?Now, sensationdoesn’t itself occupy any part of space or oftime,3but it takes time to get from empty space or time to·something involving·sensation. Thus, although sensation(taken as that quality of empirical intuition that specificallydistinguishes it from other sensations) can never be knowna priori, it can nonetheless be intensively distinguishedfrom any of the same kind as aquantity of perceptioninany possible experience. That’s what makes it possible toapply mathematics to nature as regards the sensory intuitionthrough which nature is given to us.But pay special attention to the mode of proof of(3)the principles that occur under•the title of ‘Analogies ofExperience’. Unlike the principles of applied mathematics,these refer not to thegenesisof intuitions but tohow they areinterconnected, as they actually occur, in experience; whichcan only be the story of how they are made to occur in timeaccording to necessary laws—laws that make the conditionsobjectively valid and thus create experience. So the proof ofthese principles doesn’t turn on connections amongstthingsin themselvesbut merely amongstperceptions; and it doesn’tinvolve the matter or content of the perceptions, but onlyhow they are related to one another in time according touniversal laws. . . .In these preliminaries I can’t go on longer about this,except to say one thing to my reader. You have probably beenlong accustomed to regarding experience as a mere empiricalhanging-together of perceptions, and so haven’t had thethought that it must go much beyond them, conferring uni-versal validity on empirical judgments and for that purposerequiring a pure anda prioriunity of the understanding.So I recommend to you that you pay special attention tomy distinction betweenexperienceand a mereaggregate ofperceptions, and to judge the mode of proof from this pointof view.27Now we have reached the place where Humean doubt can beremoved. Hume rightly said that reason can’t give us insightinto•causality, i.e. the notion that the existence of onething might necessitate the existence of another.I add that we have equally little insight into the concept of•substance, i.e. the notion that the existence of thingsmust be based on a subject that cannot itself be apredicate of anything else.Indeed, we can form no concept of the possibility of sucha thing, although we can point to examples of its use inexperience. Nor have we any insight into•two-way causal interaction, i.e. into how substancesthat have their own entirely separate existences cannecessarily depend on one another.None of these three concepts is supplied by reason; theyhave—as I have shown—their seat in the understanding.These concepts and the principles drawn from them standa prioribefore all experience; they are applicable only toexperience, but within that domain they have undoubtedobjective rightness. That doctrine saves me from having toconclude that the concepts in question are borrowed fromexperience, which would mean that the necessity they involveis fictitious—a mere illusion resulting from long habit.28I can’t conceive how(1)things in themselves could•exist as substances, or•be causes, or•be in two-way causal interaction with others as partsof a real whole.34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?Still less can I conceive how any of these could be true of(2)appearances considered as raw and unprocessed perceptionsor sensory states, not brought under concepts of the under-standing. But we can conceive of such connections of(3)representations in our understanding. These representationsfigure in one kind of judgment as•subject related to predicates,in a second kind as•source related to upshot,and in a third kind as•parts that are inter-related to make up a knowablewhole.We also knowa priorithat unless we take the representationof an object to be related in one of these ways, we can’thave any knowledge that would be valid of the object. Ofcourse if we attend to the objectin itself, we are lost: thereis no possible way for me to recognize that a thing in itselfis related in one of those ways, i.e. that it belongs underthe concept of•substance or of•cause or (in relation toother substances) under the concept of•two-way causalinteraction. But things in themselves aren’t my topic. WhatI am concerned with is how experiential knowledge of thingsinvolves those three types of judgment, i.e. how objectsof experience can be brought under those concepts of theunderstanding. I have perfect insight intothat: I grasp notmerely that wecanbring appearances under these conceptsbut that wemustdo so, in that way using the concepts asprinciples of the possibility of experience.29Let us apply all this to Hume’s problematic concept, namelythe concept of cause. Sheer logic tells mea priorithatthere can be conditional judgments—ones of the form ‘If. . . ,then. . . ’—in which one piece of knowledge is treated as asource and another as an upshot. I may have occasion tomake such a judgment, reporting that in my perceptionsone kind of appearance is regularly followed by another,as when I say ‘If the sun shines long enough on a body,then the body grows warm’. This doesn’t connect the twonecessarily, and it doesn’t involve the concept of cause; sofar, it is merely a subjective connection ofperceptions. Forit to be a proposition ofexperience, it must be regarded asnecessary and as universally valid, like the proposition ‘Thesun through its light is the cause of heat’. The empiricalgeneralization with which I started is now regarded as alaw, and as being valid for appearances in a manner that isrequired if experience is to be possible—for there can’t beexperience without rules that are universally and thereforenecessarily valid. So I do have insight into the concept ofcause, as a concept necessarily belonging to the possibility ofexperience. What about the concept of things·in themselves·as causes? I have no conception ofthat, because the conceptof cause doesn’t correspond to anything in•things but onlyto a•fact about experience, namely that if experience is tobe objectively valid knowledge of appearances and of theirsequence in time, some appearances must be related to laterones in conditional judgments.30Hence the pure concepts of the understanding have abso-lutely no meaning if they are pulled away from objects ofexperience and applied to things in themselves (noumena).[Kant uses ‘noumenon’ (plural ‘noumena’) to mean ‘thing that can onlybe thought’, in contrast to ‘phenomenon’ (plural ‘phenomena’), meaning‘thing that can be experienced’. Things in themselves are noumenabecause although we can perhaps think about them, we can’t possibly ex-perience them.]The role of pure concepts of the understandingis tospell outappearances, so to speak, enabling them to be35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?read as experience. When these concepts are applied to theworld of the senses, the principles that arise from this usehelp our understanding to manage our experience. Beyondthe bounds of experience they are arbitrary connections withno objective reality: there is noa prioriguarantee that theyapply to anything, and no examples can be given of theirapplicability to objects. Indeed, we don’t even know whatsuch an example could be like. We have no conception ofit, because examples have to be drawn from some possibleexperience. Possible experience is the proper domain of thepure concepts of the understanding.So the Humean problem is completely solved, though ina way that would have surprised its inventor. The solutionsecures ana prioriorigin for the pure concepts of the un-derstanding, and for the universal laws of nature it securesa status as valid laws of the understanding; but it doesthis in such a way as to limit the use of these concepts toexperience only, and it grounds them in a relation betweenthe understanding and experience that is the completereverse of anything that Hume envisaged—instead of theconcepts being derived from experience, that experience isderived from them.My line of argument yields the following result:Allsynthetic a priori principles are simply principles of possibleexperience; they can never be applied to things in themselves,but only to appearances as objects of experience. Hence puremathematics as well as pure natural science can never bearon anything except appearances.31Until now, metaphysicians have proceeded boldly enough,but always trampling over everything blindly, without makingany distinctions. My work gives us, at last, somethingdefinite to rely on as a guide in metaphysical enterprises. Itnever dawned on the dogmatic thinkers that the goal of theirefforts might be so near; nor did it dawn on the philosopherswho, proud of their supposedly soundreason, set out on theirquest for results, equipped with concepts and principles ofpure reason (which were legitimate and natural, but fit onlyfor merely empirical use). These philosophers did not andcouldnot know any fixed boundaries to the territory withinwhich results might be gained, because they hadn’t andcouldn’t haveever reflected on the nature of such a pureunderstanding or even on its possibility.Many a naturalist of pure reason (by which I meansomeone who thinks he can settle metaphysical questionswithout any theoretical grounding in the subject) may claimthat the prophetic spirit of his sound reason enabled him,long ago, not merely to suspect but to know and understandthe doctrine I have been advancing with so much ado (or,as he may prefer to say, with long-winded pomp), namelythatwith all our reason we can never reach beyond thedomain of experience. But when he is questioned abouthis principles of reason individually, he must admit thatmany of them haven’t beentaken fromexperience and arethereforeindependent ofit and valida priori. But thenwhat basis will he have for putting limits on the dogmatistwho uses these concepts and principles beyond all possibleexperience because he sees them to be independent of it?And even he, this expert in sound reason, in spite of allhis assumed and cheaply acquired wisdom, risks wanderinginadvertently beyond objects of experience into the domain offantasies. He is often deeply enough involved in it, though hecolours his groundless claims by adopting popular languageand announcing everything as ‘mere probability’, ‘rationalconjecture’, or ‘analogy’.36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?32Since the earliest times of philosophy, enquirers into purereason have thought that in addition to the things of thesenses, or appearances (phenomena) of the world of thesenses, there are things of the understanding (noumena),and have thought that only the latter are real. That’s becausethey took the former—i.e. appearances—to be illusory; amistake, but an excusable one in a primitive age.In fact, when we (rightly) regard the objects of the sensesas mere appearances, we thereby admit that they have athing in itself as their ground—·namely, the thingofwhichthey are appearances·. We don’t know what this thingis like in itself; all we know is its appearance, i.e. howthis unknown something affects our senses. In acceptingappearances, therefore, we also admit the existence of thingsin themselves: the thought of such·noumena, i.e.·‘things ofthe understanding’, isn’t merely allowed but is unavoidable.[In this paragraph, Kant refers to the Aesthetic. That’s the first partof theCritique of Pure Reason, concerning the status of time and spaceand their relation to sensibility.]My critical deduction limits theprinciples of the Aesthetic so that they hold good only forobjects of possible experience, because extending them to allthings would be turning everything into mere appearance;my deduction doesn’t at all imply thatthere areno noumena.So these beings of the understanding are allowed, subjectto this rule, to which there can be no exceptions:We don’tand can’t know anything determinate about these beings ofthe understanding.That’s because our pure concepts ofthe understanding and our pure intuitions bear on objectsof possible experience—i.e. things of the senses—and onnothing else. As soon as we move away from the senses,those concepts are drained of all their meaning.33Indeed, there’s something seductive in our pure conceptsof the understanding, which tempts us to use them in atranscendentmanner—that being my label for a use thatgoes beyondall possible experience[not = ‘transcendental’; seeexplanation on page 24]. Our concepts of substance, of power, ofaction, of reality, and others are quite independent of experi-ence, containing nothing of sensory appearance, and so theyseem to be applicable to things in themselves (noumena).And this impression is strengthened by the fact that thoseconcepts contain within themselves an element ofnecessitywhich experience never matches up to. The concept ofcauseimplies a rule according to which one state follows anothernecessarily; but experience can only show us that one stateof affairsoften or usually followsanother, so it can’t provideus with either strict universality or necessity.So the concepts of the understandingseemto havecontent and significance that spreads beyond their empiricaluse, and the understanding unknowingly builds for itself amuch larger addition to the house of experience, and fillsit with merely notional entities, without once noticing that·in doing this·it has carried its otherwise lawful conceptsbeyond the bounds of their·legitimate·use.34Because of all this, theCritique of Pure Reasonhad to containtwo important though extremely dry investigations. In one ofthem, contained in the chapter entitled ‘The Schematism ofthe Pure Concepts of the Understanding’, I show that whatthe senses provide for are not•concrete applications of thepure concepts of the understanding, but only the•schemasfor their use, and that the corresponding object occurs onlyin experience (as something the understanding makes outof the materials of the senses). In the second indispensable37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?chapter, ‘On the Basis for Distinguishing all Objects into Phe-nomena and Noumena’, I show that, although our pure con-cepts and principles of the understanding are independentof experience, and despite theirseeminglygreater sphere ofuse, we still can’t use them to have any thoughts whatsoeverbeyond the domain of experience, because their only role is tofixthe logical forms of judgments that we make about givenintuitions. But as there’s absolutely no intuition outside thedomain of the senses, these pure concepts have no meaningoutside that domain; and all these noumena, together withthe intelligible4world that they compose, are nothing but therepresentation of aproblem,·namely the problem or ques-tion:What are noumena like? What is the intelligible worldlike?·What the question isaboutis something possible; butanswering it in terms of the concepts of our understandingis quite impossible. That’s because of the nature of ourunderstanding, whose role isn’t to deliver intuitions but toconnect intuitions that are given in experience;·i.e. it doesn’tpresent us with real particular things, but only enablesus to inter-connect particulars that we get from elsewhere,namely from our senses·. So experience must contain all thematerials to which we apply our concepts; and beyond it noconcepts have any significance, as there’s no intuition thatmight offer them something to grip onto.35The•imagination may perhaps be forgiven for sometimeswandering, not keeping carefully within the limits of experi-ence; for such roaming gives it life and vigour, and·that’san advantage, because·it is always easier to moderate theimagination’s boldness than to rouse it from lethargy. Butthe•understanding’s job is tothink, and it can never beforgiven if itwandersinstead, for it is our only resource forsetting limits, when they are needed, to the wanderings ofthe imagination.The understanding begins its misbehaviour very inno-cently and soberly. First it brings to light the elementaryitems of knowledge that it containsin advance ofall experi-ence, though they must never be appliedoutsideexperience.It gradually discards these limits, and what’s to prevent itfrom doing so when it has quite freely drawn its principlesfrom itself?·Then, having dropped the restriction to experi-ence·, it proceeds first to newly-thought-up powers in nature,and soon after that to beings outside nature. In short, itproceeds to a·non-natural·world; and there can be noshortage of materials for constructing such a world, becausefertile fiction-making provides them in abundance—andthough it isn’tconfirmedby experience it is neverrefutedby it either. This is why young thinkers arc so partial tometaphysics of the truly dogmatic kind, devoting to it theirtime and talents that could be better employed.But it is no use trying to damp down these fruitless effortsof pure reason by•offering all sorts of reminders of howhard it is to answer such deep questions, by•complainingabout how limited our reason is, and by•down-playingour assertions as mere conjectures. The only way to getthese fruitless efforts to be completely abandoned is to•show clearly that they are impossible, and to allow reason’sknowledge of itselfto become a true science in·terms of·which the domain of reason’s right use is distinguished withmathematical certainty from that of its worthless and idleuse.4Nottheintellectualworld (as the usual expression is). For cognitive•operations of the understanding are intellectual, and some of them arethinkings about the world of our senses. The term ‘intelligible’ applies to•objects insofar as they can be represented by the understanding all on itsown, without our sensible intuitions coming into it in any way. . . .38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?36:How is nature itself possible?This question is the highest point that transcendental phi-losophy can ever touch.[Reminder: by ‘transcendental’ Kant means‘having to do with grounds fora prioriknowledge’.]It is a pointthat transcendental philosophymustreach, because it is itsboundary and completion. Really it contains two questions.First: What makes it possible for there to be nature—inthematerialsense of that word, in which it stands for thetotality of appearances? That is to ask: How are space andtime and their contents possible in general? The answeris: What makes them possible is•the way our sensibilityis—the special way in which it is affected by objects thatare in themselves unknown and aren’t in themselves spatialor temporal. This answer has been given in theCritique(inthe Transcendental Aesthetic), and here in thePreliminariesthrough the solution·in sections 6–13·of the first problem·raised at the end of section 5·.Secondly: What makes it possible for there to be naturein theformalsense, in which nature involves the totalityof rules that must apply to all appearances if they are tobe connected by thought in an experience? The answermust be this: What makes nature possible is•the way ourunderstanding works.·In the background is the crucial factthat·all the representations of the sensibility have to berelated to a consciousness;·for different items to be held ina single consciousness, they must be related to one anotherin certain ways, and these relations are imposed uponthem by the understanding. And so all the representationsthat we are discussing must fall within the scope of ourunderstanding. And the answer to our question is that therecan be a rule-governednature(in the formal sense) because·our understanding demands that items that are thoughtabout be brought under rules. This rule-governedness iswhat makesexperiencepossible; don’t mistake this for aninsight into the objects in themselves! This answer is givenin theCritiqueitself (in the Transcendental Logic), and inthesePreliminariesin the course of the solution·in sections14–32·of the second main problem·raised at the end ofsection 5·.Why is our sensibility like that? Why is our understand-ing like that? We cannot address these questions, becausewe have touseour sensibility and our understanding in allthe questions we ask and all the thinking we do in lookingfor answers.There are many laws of nature that we can know onlythrough experience; but experience can’t teach us the generaltruth thatappearances are connected in conformity withlaws, because the application of such laws is what makesexperience possible in the first place.So the possibility of experience—ofanyexperience—is atthe same time the universal law of nature, and the principlesof the experience are themselves the laws of nature. For weknow nature only as the sum-total of appearances, i.e. ofrepresentationsin us, and so the only source from which wecan derivethe laws governing•how nature’s parts are inter-connectedisthe principles governing•how they are connectedinus,that is•the conditions that have to be satisfied if they are tobe united in a single consciousness.If they weren’t united into one consciousness there couldn’tbe any experience.The main thesis of this part of thePreliminaries, namelythat universal laws of nature can be knowna priori, leads allby itself to this conclusion:39"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?The source of the highest laws of nature lies in our-selves, i.e. in our understanding. Rather than using•experience to find the universal laws of nature in•nature, we must go in the opposite direction. Thatis, we must look for•nature itself—as a system thatuniversally conforms to laws—in the features of oursensibility and understanding that make•experiencepossible.How else could the laws of nature be knowna priori, giventhat they aren’t analytic but synthetic?Why must the principles of possible experience agree withthe laws that govern what is possible in nature? We have achoice of two answers: either(1)these laws are drawn fromnature by means of experience, or conversely(2)nature isdeduced from the conditions that make experience possible.But(1)is self-contradictory, for the universal laws of naturemust be known independently of all experience, because allempirical use of the understanding is based on them; so only(2)remains.5Empirical laws of nature always rely on particular per-ceptions. We must distinguish such laws from the pure oruniversal laws of nature, which aren’t based on particularperceptions and simply lay down the conditions that enableperceptions to be unified so as to constitute experience. Sofar as the laws are concerned,natureandpossible experienceare one and the same.•The law-abidingness of possibleexperience—·i.e. the holding of laws that are valid not justfor actual but for all possible experience·—depends on•thenecessary connection of appearances in experience (a connec-tion without which·there would no unified consciousness,and so·we wouldn’t be able to know any object whatever inthe sensible world), and so it depends on•the original lawsof the understanding. Because of this, we can say—thoughit sounds strange at first—thatThe understanding doesn’tdraw its lawsfromnature, but prescribes themtonature.37I shall illustrate this seemingly bold proposition by an ex-ample that is meant to show that laws that we discover inobjects of sensory intuition (especially laws that we knowto be necessary) are already held by us to have been placedthere by the•understanding, even though they are otherwisejust like the laws of nature that we ascribe to•experience.·Actually, I shall do rather more than that. I shall showthat laws that we are already willing to ascribe to ourunderstanding (namely, those of geometry)lead toone ofthe laws (namely, the inverse-square law of gravitation) thatwe wouldn’t think of as contributed by our understandingunless we had been introduced to my critical philosophy·.38If we consider the properties of the circle, through whichthis figure provides a unity for ever so many arbitrary spatialconfigurations all under a single universal rule, we can’t helpcrediting this geometrical thing with having a constitution.(·Analogously, when we think about the properties ofiron,through which it enters into countless law-governed inter-actions with all sorts of other kinds of stuff, we can’t helpcreditingitwith a constitution or inner nature·.) For example,takeanytwo straight lines that intersect one another andintersect some circle (any circle you like):5Crusius was alone in suggesting a middle way. It could be (he said) that these laws of nature were originally implanted in us by a spirit who can’terr or deceive. But there is so much human error—including plenty of it in Crusius’ own system!—that it seems very dangerous to rely on this lineof thought. Even if some things have been instilled in us by the Spirit of Truth, we have no reliable way of distinguishing these from ones put thereby the Father of Lies.40"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?The rectangle constructed with the two segments ofone of the lines is equal to the rectangle constructedwith the two segments of the other.Now I ask:Does this law lie in the circle or in the understand-ing?That is: Is the basis for this law somethingcontainedinthe figure itself, independently of the understanding,or is the situation rather that the understanding, havingconstructed the figure according to its concepts (a set ofpoints equidistant from a given point)introduces into itthislaw about the chords cutting one another in geometricalproportion? When we follow the proofs of this law, we soonsee that it can only be derived from the equality of the circle’sradii, which is the basis for the understanding’s constructionof this figure. But we can replace the concept on whichthe circle is based by a more general one that fits everysort of conic section (the circle being just one sort); thatwill advance the project of unifying various properties ofgeometrical figures under common laws; and if we take thatstep we’ll find that all the chords that intersect within theellipse, parabola, and hyperbola, always intersect in sucha way that the rectangles of their segments always•bear aconstant ratio to one another (the circle is the special casewhere they•are equal).If we proceed still further, to the fundamental laws ofphysical astronomy, we find that the whole of the materialworld is governed by a physical law of mutual attraction forwhich the rule is:The force of attraction decreases inverselyas the square of the distance from each attracting point, i.e.as the spherical surfaces increase over which the forcespreads.[Kant’s line of thought is as follows. Think of gravity asradiating out from a point, exerting the same total force evenly acrossthe surface of each imaginary sphere with that point as centre. The•surface-areas of the spheres differ with the squares of their radii, i.e.their distance from the central point;that’s simple geometry. Then•the amount of gravitational force received by an object of a given sizewill vary with theproportionof its sphere-surface that it occupies, whichmeans that it will vary inversely with the square of its distance from thegravitational source.]The simplicity of the sources of this law,which rest merely on the relation of spherical surfaces ofdifferent radii, is matched by what follows from it, namelysuch a splendid variety and harmony of consequences thatnot only are all possible orbits of the celestial bodies conicsections, but these orbits are inter-related in such a waythat no law of attraction other than the inverse-square onecan beimaginedas appropriate for a cosmic system.So here’s a nature that rests on laws that the understand-ing knowsa priori, and chiefly from the universal principlesof the geometry of space. Now I ask:•Do the laws of naturelie in space, and does our understanding learn them merelyby trying to discover the great wealth of meaning that liesin space; or•do they inhere in the understanding and in itsway of configuring space . . . .?Because it is so uniform and so indeterminate in itsparticular properties, one wouldn’t look tospacefor laws ofnature.·In contrast with that, there’s no threat of uniformityin the understanding!·What imposes circles, cones andspheres on space isthe understanding, in its role as providerof the basis for of the constructions of those figures.So the mere universal form of intuition that we call ‘space’is the underlay of all intuitions of particular objects. There’sno denying that•space makes the•intuitions possible inall their variety; but the unity of the•objects—·or ratherthe unity among the intuitions that lets them qualify asintuitionsofobjects·—comes·not from space but·from theunderstanding, in accordance with conditions that lie in itsown nature. And so the understanding is the origin of theuniversal order of nature, in that it brings all appearances41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?under its own laws, and thereby constructs the formalaspects of experiencea priori, so that nothing can be knownby experience except what conforms to the understanding’slaws. The nature of•things in themselves is independentof the conditions of our sensibility and our understanding;but our concern is not with that but rather with•natureconsidered as an object of possible experience; and herethe understanding, by making experience possible, brings itabout that the world of the senses either isnature(·in mysense, as given in section 14 above·) or isnot an object ofexperience at all.39:Appendix to the pure science of nature: the system ofthe CategoriesNothing can be more desirable for a philosopher than totake the multitude of concepts or principles that he hasfound himself applying in particular cases, and to derivethema priorifrom a single principle, thus uniting themall into a single cognition. Before that, all he had was thebelief that he had gathered together all·the concepts orprinciples·that remained after a certain abstraction andseemed to resemble one another enough to constitute aspecifickindof knowledge; but what he had gathered wasonly an aggregate—·a disorderly heap·. Now,·after hisderivation from a single principle·,•he knows that this kindof knowledge involvesjust these·concepts or principles·,neither more nor less,•he understands that his classificationof them is necessary, and, at last,•he has asystem.You don’t need harder thought or more insight tosearch out in our daily knowledge the concepts which,though they don’t rest on any particular experience,occur in all experiential knowledge of which they are(as it were) the mere form of connection,than you do tosearch out in a language the general rules of theactual use of words, and thus collect elements for agrammar.In fact the two researches are very closely related. Though·adifference between them arises from the following fact·: wecan’t give a reason why each language has just this and noother grammatical structure, let alone why its formal rulesarejust these, neither more nor less.Aristotle collected ten pure elementary concepts underthe name of ‘categories’ and also ‘predicaments’. He thenfound that he had to add to his list five ‘post-predicaments’(though some of them were already contained in the firstten); but this random collection should be applauded moreas a hint for future enquirers than as an idea developedaccording to a rule; which is why in philosophy’s presentmore advanced state it has been rejected as quite useless.In my research into the elements of human knowledgethat are pure (contain nothing empirical), my first success—achieved after long thought—was to distinguish and separatethe pure elementary concepts ofsensibility(space and time)from those of theunderstanding. Thus Aristotle’s categoriesof time, space, and place had to be excluded·because theypertain to sensibility, not understanding, and so are notcategories·. And the others on his list were useless to me,because·associated with them·there was no principle onthe basis of which the understanding could be surveyedin its entirety, making possible a complete and preciseaccount of all the things it can do from which arise its pureconcepts—·its categories·.Wanting to discover such a principle, I looked about for•an act of the understanding that contains all its other acts.With the help of that•one kind of act I could bring all thevariety of representations into a unified theory of thinkingin general. The desired•act of the understanding turned42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?out to be:judging. Then I availed myself of the work ofthe logicians, imperfect though it was. With its help I wasable to present a complete list of the pure functions of theunderstanding[= ‘basic kinds of thing the understanding can do’],considered·at first·without any reference to any object towhich they might be applied. The last step was to relate thesefunctions of·the understanding—i.e. these ways of·—judging,to the conditions that settle whether a given judgment isobjectively valid. And so there arose thepure concepts of theunderstanding, concerning which I could make certain thatjust exactlythese·on my list·—neither more nor less—settlewhat knowledge of things we can have on the basis of pureunderstanding. It was all right for me to call them by theirold·Aristotelian·name,categories. . . .What distinguishes this system of categories from the oldunprincipled random collection of concepts, and what aloneentitles it to be considered as philosophy, is this essentialfact about it:By means of it the true significance of the pureconcepts of the understanding, and the condition of their use,could be precisely determined. For here it became obviousthat in themselves•the categories are nothing but•logicalfunctions,·corresponding to•logical kinds of judgment, suchas conditional, negative, universal and so on·; which meansthat they don’t by themselves yield the slightest concept ofan object. Forthatthey need some sensory intuition as abasis. So their only role is to shape up empirical judgments. . . . enabling them to become judgments of experience.Such an insight into the nature of the categories, whichlimits them to merely experiential use, never occurred to theirfirst author[Aristotle]or to any of his successors; but withoutthis insight they are quite useless and only a wretched listof names, with no explanation and no rule for their use. Ifthe ancients had ever conceived such a notion, doubtlessthe whole study of pure rational knowledge, which underthe name ‘metaphysics’ has through the centuries spoiled somany sound minds, would have reached us in quite anothershape, and would have enlightened the human understand-ing instead of—as has actually happened—exhausting it inobscure and pointless speculations, making it useless fortrue science.This system of categories exhausts all the possible actionsof the understanding, and so every other concept must fallunder them. That puts all treatment of any object of purereason on a systematic basis, and provides an absolutelyreliable pointer or clue to how and through what points ofenquiry every metaphysical endeavour must proceed if itis to be complete; for it exhaustsallthe workings of theunderstanding, under which every other concept must bebrought. Similarly with the table of principles: we can knowthatitis complete only through relation to the system of thecategories. And even in the classification of the concepts,if it is to get beyond·the sort of classification that mightbe based on findings in·the empirical psychology of theunderstanding, it is always the very same guiding thread,which, as it must always be settleda prioriby the samefixed points of the human understanding, forms a closedcircle every time, leaving no doubt that if we want acompletephilosophical anda prioriknowledge of the object of a pureconception either of the understanding or of reason, this isthe way to get it. So I couldn’t neglect this clue with regardto one of the most abstract ontological divisions, namely allthe differences that fall underthe concepts of something andof nothing, and to construct accordingly a rule-governed andnecessary table.And this system, like any true one based on a universalprinciple, shows its inestimable value in this, that it•keepsout all foreign concepts that might otherwise slink in amongthe pure concepts of the understanding, and•assigns to43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is pure natural science possible?every item of knowledge its proper place.·Here’s an example·.The concepts that I arranged in a table according to the clueof the categories, under the name ‘concepts of reflection’,turn up among the pure concepts of the understanding inontology, without having any permission or right to be there.The pure concepts of the understanding are concepts ofconnection, and thereby of the objects themselves, whereasthe concepts of reflection have to do only with the merecomparisonof concepts already given; so the nature anduses of the two kinds of concept are quite different; andmy systematic classification of the concepts of reflectionkeeps them out of company where they don’t belong. Butthe value of putting the categories in a special table of theirown will be still more obvious when we do—as I shortlyshall—distinguish those concepts of theunderstandingfromthe transcendental concepts ofreason. The latter are quitedifferent in nature and in origin from the former, so theymust have quite another form. This separation, necessary asit is, has never yet been made in any system of metaphysics,which is why the concepts of reason have been jumbledtogether with the concepts of the understanding, as thoughthey were siblings. This mix-up was inevitable in the absenceof a separate system of categories.44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?Main transcendental problem 3:How is metaphysics possible in general?40I have now provided an explanatory justification for•puremathematics and for•pure natural science. Neither of themneeded this for the sake of its own security and certainty;for pure mathematics is supported by the self-evident truthof its propositions; and pure natural science, although itsultimate sources lie in the understanding, is thoroughlysupported and confirmed by experience. (Certain as purenatural science is, it can never equal mathematics in thatregard, which is why it can’t entirely do without the testimonyof experience.) Both these sciences therefore needed myenquiry not for themselves but for another science, namely•metaphysics.Metaphysics is concerned not only with concepts ofnature (which always find their application in experience)but also withpure concepts of reason, which never findapplication in any possible experience. No experience cantell us what’s true and what’s false involving concepts ofreason, or even whether these concepts are objectively realor mere fictions. Yet the part of metaphysics that involvesthem is what the rest of metaphysics isfor—and that’s whythis science·unlike the other two·needs an explanatoryjustificationfor its own sake. The third question now beforeus concerns the heart of metaphysics, its special feature,namely reason’s preoccupation with itself, and its assump-tion that by brooding over its own•concepts it can come toknow about•objects that it supposes to arise immediately outof those•concepts without help of any kind from experience.6Reason will never be satisfied until it has solved thisproblem—·i.e. answered the question ‘How is metaphysicspossible·?’. Reason won’t let pure understanding be used out-side the domain of experience; but reason itself is destined togo beyond those confines. Every particular experience is onlya part of the whole domain of experience; butthe absolutewhole of all possible experienceis not itself an experience,yet it is something that reason has to think about, as aproblem. For reason to present this problem to itself, it needsconcepts quite different from those of the understanding.The latter are applied only to items given in experience;but the concepts of reason have a use that istranscendent:it transcends all actual and possible experience, becauseit involves thinking about the completeness of all possibleexperience, i.e. thinking aboutthe-totality-of-possible-experienceconsidered as a single unified item. Such an item couldn’titself be given in experience.Just as•the understanding suppliescategories, which areneeded for experience, so•reason suppliesIdeas, by which Imean concepts that one must have though their objects can’tbe given in any possible experience.•Ideas are as inherentin the nature of•reason as•categories are in the nature ofthe•understanding. Ideas carry with them an illusion thatcould easily mislead; this illusion is unavoidable, although itcan be prevented from actually leading us astray.6If we can say that a science is actual, at least in the thinking of all men (·subjectively actual·), as soon as we have established that the problemsleading to it are ones that are set before everybody by the nature of human reason,. . . . then we are bound to say that metaphysics issubjectivelyactual(and necessarily so), which leads us to the legitimate question: How is it(objectively) possible?45"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?All illusion consists in taking the subjective ground ofjudgment to be objective, as though reason in its use of theIdeas were acquiring a special kind of knowledge. Reasonfalls victim to this, and is guilty of error, when it takessomething that merely concerns•reason’s own nature andmode of operation and tries to make it refer to•some objectin itself. The only safeguard against this temptation is forreason to know itself—to understand what’s going on whenit uses Ideas in a transcendent, extravagant manner thatgoes beyond all possible experience.41We must distinguish Ideas, which are pure concepts ofreason, from the categories or pure concepts of the under-standing; the two correspond to two sorts of knowledge thatare quite different from one another•in their natures,•inwhere they come from, and•in how they are used. In thefundamentals of a science that purports to cover alla prioriknowledge, the distinction between Ideas and categories iscrucial. If we don’t respect it, metaphysics will be absolutelyimpossible—or at best a random, bungling attempt to build ahouse of cards in ignorance of the materials one is using andof what they are good for. If myCritique of Pure Reasonhaddone nothing but make this distinction plain for the first time,it would have contributed more to our grasp of metaphysics—what it is, and how it should be conducted—than all thefruitless efforts to do justice to the transcendent problems ofpure reason that had ever before been undertaken. BeforetheCritique, no-one had even suspected that reason wasquite different from understanding; so everybody ran thetwo together, mentioning concepts of the understanding andconcepts of reason in the same breath, as though they wereof the same kind.42All instances of pure knowledge by the understanding havethis in common:·although they aren’t derived from experi-ence·, they involve concepts that can have application in ex-perience, and principles that can be confirmed by experience.Transcendent knowledge by reason contrasts with this. TheIdeas that it involves can’t be applied in experience, nor canits propositions ever be confirmed or refuted by experience.If any errors creep into the employment of reason, they willhave to be discovered by pure reason itself·because neithersensibility nor understanding can have anything to do withthem·. For reason thus to stand guard over itself is verydifficult, because the reason that is standing guard is thevery faculty that is necessarily prone to intellectual illusions,and we have no firm objectively grounded procedure foravoiding them—only a subjective enquiry into reason itselfas a source of Ideas.43My chief aim in theCritiquewas not only to distinguishcarefully the various sorts of knowledge but also to derivefrom their common source the concepts belonging to eachof them. I did this so that by knowing the origins of theseconcepts I could settle how they might safely be used; andit also gave me the priceless though unexpected advantageof knowing,a prioriand in a principled way, that•my list ofconcepts, and•my classification and•descriptions of them,are complete. Without this, everything in metaphysics is amere jumble, in which you never know whether you haveenough·for your purpose·, or whether and where somethingis still lacking. This advantage is the very essence of purephilosophy, and isn’t to be had anywhere else.I have derived the twelve categories—the four trios ofpure concepts of theunderstanding -from a classification of46"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?kinds of judgment that can be made. The concepts of reasonare three in number, and they derive from a classificationnot ofjudgmentsbut oflogical arguments—specifically, thethree kinds ofinferences of reason. For these pure conceptsof reason (the transcendental Ideas) are given—we simplydohave them—and if one doesn’t want to regard them assomething likeinnate, the only source that can be found forthem is the activity of reason. That activity in its concernwith logical form constitutes the logical element of the infer-ences of reason; but it also involves recognizing judgmentsof the understanding as involving this or thata prioriform ofjudgment, and in this role it yields transcendental conceptsof pure reason.The basic sorts of argument are: categorical, conditional,and disjunctive.[A categorical argument has a first premise of theform ‘(Subject) is (Predicate)’; a conditional one has a premise of the form‘If P, then Q’; a disjunctive one has one of the form ‘Either P or Q’.]·EachIdea involves the thought of a kind ofcompleteness·. So theIdeas—the concepts of pure reason—are as follows.•Categorical: the Idea of a complete subject (the Ideaofwhat is substantial);·this is the Idea of an ulti-mate ‘thing which. . . ’, like Locke’s idea of substancein general·; this Idea is psychological·because thenatural home ground of this thought is in applicationto oneself: I am a thing which·. . . ’.•Conditional: the Idea of a complete series ofconditions—·e.g. the thought of all the causes of thepresent state of the world·; this Idea is cosmological.•Disjunctive: the Idea of a complete reality that some-how encompasses the entire range of what’s possible;this Idea is theological.7[For an explanation of how theologycomes into this, see section 55 on page 59. It’s not very helpful,but it’s all Kant gives us in this work.]All three give rise todialectics—·i.e. to characteristic dangersof intellectual illusion, insoluble problems, lurking contradic-tions, and the like·. But their ways of doing so are different,and so we have—·corresponding to the trio•categorical,•conditional, and•disjunctive—a·three-part division of the dialectics intoits•Paralogism, its•Antinomy, and its•Ideal.Through this way of coming at things we can feel assuredthat all the claims of pure reason are completely represented,nothing missed, because we have completely surveyed thefaculty of reason itself, from which they all take their origin.44It should be borne in mind that the Ideas of reason, unlikethe categories, don’t help us to bring the understandingto bear on experience. In the knowledge of nature by theunderstanding, the Ideas of reason are entirely dispensable;indeed they are a positive obstacle to what is going on. (Theyhave, however, their own good use, which we’ll come to later.)•The psychological Idea of reason brings up the question ‘Isthe soul a simple substance or not?’ The answer to thatis of no interest when we are doing empirical psychology.No possible experience could be evidence for either answerto the question. So far as the description and explanationof our mental histories is concerned, the concept ofsimplesubstanceis quite empty.•As for the questions raised bythe cosmological Idea—Did the world begin? Will it end?—answers to these can have no role whatever in explaining7In disjunctive judgments we considerthe whole range of what is possibleas divided in respect to some particular concept. The ontological principlethatevery object falls under one or the other out of each contradictory pair of predicates, which is also the principle of all disjunctive judgments,essentially relies on this thought of the sum of all possibility—which goes with the thought that every possible object is completely determinate,·because it falls under just one out of each contradictory pair of predicates·. . . .47"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?any eventinthe world.•And as for the theological Idea:there’s a correct maxim of natural science that says that weshouldn’t try to explain how nature is by appealing to thewill of a highest being, because such an explanation wouldno longer be natural science, but rather an admission thatwe have reached the end of it. So the proper use of•Ideas ofreason must be quite different from the use of the•categories,i.e. the•pure concepts of the understanding through whichexperience becomes possible.Now, reason and understanding are related with oneanother in a certain manner, which brings in some parts ofmy laborious analytic of the understanding[i.e. the part of theCritique of Pure Reasonlabelled ‘Transcendental Analytic’]. How? Well,it can’t have to do with the business of getting knowledge ofnature through experience: the part reason plays in that—inmathematics and natural science—can be perfectly wellplayed without all this subtle examination of the natureand functions of the understanding. So my analytic of theunderstanding must link with the Ideas of pure reason fora purpose that lies beyond the empirical use of the under-standing.·So now we have a dilemma. On the one hand·, Ihave said that we can’t use the understanding outside therealm of experience, as that would be a meaningless activity,with no subject-matter. On the other hand, the nature ofreason must conform with the activities of the understanding,contributing to their perfection and not disturbing them.Here’s the solution—thetruthabout what reason hasto do with understanding. What pure reason does is todemand that understanding, when it is brought to bear onthe complex of experience, shall achievecompletenessinits operations. This, however, is only a completeness ofprinciples, not of intuitions and objects.·To put the pointin simpler terms: The demand for completeness says ‘Aslong as there’s something you don’t yet understand, keepworking on it’; it doesn’t say ‘Aim to grasp the whole storyall at once:•survey the mind in such a way that you haveall its properties on one side and the ultimate subject thatbears those properties on the other;•arrive at results aboutthe world’s entire past and entire future;•think in a concreteway about God as the explanation of the entire world’·. Theillusion—which brings the risk of error—comes from the factthat reason, wanting to make its demand for completenessas sharp and graspable as possible, slips into treating it asthough it were a demand for knowledge of something—·theultimate subject of mental states, the world’s whole past,etc·.45:Prefatory remark to the dialectic of pure reasonI have shown in sections 33 and 34 that the freedom ofthe categories from any input from the senses may misleadreason into extending their use, quite beyond all experience,to things·as they are·in themselves·as distinct from thingsas they appear to us·; though·no such use is legitimate,for the following reason·. Because the categories lack anysensory element that can give them meaning or sense inparticular cases, they can representanythingin their role asmere logical functions; but there’snothingabout which theycan, unaided, give specific information. The fancy objects·that reason wrongly tries to bring under the categories·areknown as ‘noumena’, or pure beings of the understanding(or better, beings of thought). Examples includesubstance—but conceived without permanence intime,cause—but not conceived as acting in time,and so on.·In thinking or talking like this·one attaches tothese·supposed·objects predicates whose only·legitimate·use is to enable experience to conform to laws; and yet·byleavingtimeout of it·one deprives them of all the conditions48"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?of intuition that have to be satisfied for experience to bepossible, and so these concepts lose all meaning again.There’s no risk that the understanding, when left to itselfand not given orders from the outside, will so wantonly roamout of its own proper territory into that of mere creatures ofthought. But the empirical use of the rules of the understand-ing isconditioned, and reason can’t be fully satisfied withthat; so it demands acompletionof this chain of conditions.[Until this point in thePreliminariesthe concept ofconditionhas beenused almost entirely in saying things about(a)the conditions that ourunderstanding must satisfy, the conditions that our sensibility mustsatisfy—e.g. in saying that spatiality and temporality are formal condi-tions of our sensibility. We now, for almost the first time, encounter adifferent use of the concept: the topic now is not(a)the general conditions that have to be satisfied if we are tohave certain kinds of engagement with the world,but rather(b)the conditions that various itemswithinthe world have tosatisfy if they are to exist.Examples of(b): Any event in the experienced world occurs only becausesomething causes it to do so; any region of space exists only becausethere is a larger region in which it is embedded; any period of timeexists only because there was an earlier period of time leading up toit; any state exists only if there is something that it is the stateof; andso on. Kant holds that(b)these in-the-experienced-world conditioningrelationships can be depended onbecausethey are put there by(a)thegeneral conditions that our sensibility and understanding have to satisfy.So all this is part of a single unified body of doctrine. Still, it is as well tonotice how, after so much talk about ‘conditions’, we are rather suddenlyon the presence of the notion ofchainsof conditions. It is just the shiftfrom(a)to(b).]This forces the understanding to leave its proper domain, sothat it can do two things:•represent objects of experiencein a series that stretches too far for any experience tocapture it, and•look completely outside itself for noumenato which it can attach that chain, thus completing the series,escaping from the conditions of experience, and making itshold complete. So there they are—the transcendental Ideas.·•They are in themselves virtuous, though•they can maketrouble; but•the trouble can be averted·.•They don’t tryto produce concepts that are in themselves excessive orextravagant; all they aim for—in conformity with the truebut hidden goal to which our reason is naturally drawn—isa limitless extension of the empirical use of the categories.•But through an unavoidable·intellectual·illusion they mayseduce the understanding into using the categories in atranscendentmanner,·i.e. in a manner that isn’t related toexperience·. Deceitful as this misuse is,·it is hard to avoid·.To keep yourself from it and confine the categories withinthe bounds of experience, it won’t do merely to resolve inadvance to be on your guard against doing so.•What youneed is scientific instruction·on how to avoid the trouble·,and even then it takes hard work.I. The psychological Ideas46People have long since remarked that in all substances theproper subject—namely, thesubstantialas such, i.e. what remainsafter all the qualities (as predicates) are set aside—is unknown, and this limit on our knowledge has been thetopic of various complaints. But if our understanding isat fault in this matter, it is not for itsinability toknow—todetermine by itself—the substance of things, but rather foritswantingto know the substance of things, thereby treatinga mere Idea as though it were a given object·into whosenature one might enquire·. Pure reason demands that forevery predicate of a thing we seek its proper subject; but•this subject can’t be anything but a·further·predicate, so49"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?reason tells us to find a subject for•it in its turn, and so on,indefinitely (or until we give up). So we are never to regardanything that we arrive at as an ultimate subject: and ourunderstanding can never have the thought ofthe substantialitself, however deeply it penetrates and even if all of nature isunveiled to us. That’s because the special characteristicof our understanding is that when it thinks somethingit does so by representing it through concepts, and thusthrough mere predicates; so it can never reach the absolutesubject—·the sheerthing, not understood as thing-that-is-Ffor any predicate F·. Hence all the real properties throughwhich we know bodies are mere qualities of them; and thatincludes impenetrability, which we can only represent toourselves as the effect of a power whose subject is unknownto us.Now, it appears as if wedoconfront this·absolute·subject in our consciousness ofourselves(of the thinkingsubject), and indeed that we have this in an immediateintuition; for all the predicates of inner sense refer to theIas a subject, and I can’t conceive myself as the predicateof some other subject. So itseemsthat we are given inexperience something that completes the process of relatinggiven concepts predicatively to a subject—given it not merelyas an idea but as an object, i.e. the absolute subject itself.But this turns out to be a false hope. For theIisn’t aconcept,8but only a designation of the object of inner senseinsofar as we know it by no further predicate. So it can’titself be a predicate of any other thing, any more than itcan be a determinate concept of an absolute subject; it’sonly arelatingof inner phenomena to their unknown subject.Yet this Idea (which does excellent service as a regulativeprinciple, totally destroying all materialistic explanations ofthe inner phenomena of the soul) leads through a whollynatural misunderstanding to a highly plausible argument:from•this supposed knowledge of the substantial status ofour thinking being, the argument infers•conclusions aboutthe nature of the soul—the nature of it that lies right outsidethe compass of experience.[See the explanation of ’regulative’ atthe end of section 56 on page 60.]47We may call this thinking self (the soul)substance, as beingthe ultimate subject of thinking that can’t be further repre-sented as the predicate of something else; but the concept·of substance, in this use of it·, remains quite empty, withnothing following from it, if it can’t be shown to involvepermanence—which is what makes fruitful the concept ofsubstances that we encounter in experience.But permanence can never be proved on the basis of theconcept of a substance considered as a thing in itself, butonly in relation to experience. This is adequately shownby the first Analogy of Experience·in theCritique of PureReason·. If that proof doesn’t convince you, try for yourselfwhether you can derive from the concept ofa subject thatdoesn’t exist as the predicate of another thingthatits exis-tence is thoroughly permanentand that it cannot—unaidedor through any natural cause—either come into existence orbe annihilated. Synthetica prioripropositions such asthatcan never be proved·of things·in themselves, but only inapplication to things as objects of possible experience.8If the representation of self-awareness, theI, were a concept through which something could be thought, it could be used as a predicate of otherthings or would contain such predicates in itself. But it is nothing more than the feeling of something existing, without the slightest concept of it; itis only the representation ofthat to which all thinking relates.50"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?48So if we want to use the concept of•the soul as substanceas a basis on which to conclude that•the soul is permanent,we can do this only in relation to possible experience; if wetake the soul to be a thing in itself, and look for a conclusionthat holds good beyond the bounds of all possible experience,permanence can’t be shown. But all our possible experiencerequires us to be alive; so the only permanence-of-the-soulresult we can establish is that the soul ispermanent through-out one’s life; for the death of man is the end of all experiencethat the soul could have of itself as an object—unless thecontrary is proved, but that ‘contrary’ is supposed to be theconclusion of the argument for the soul’s permanence, so itcan’t appear among the premises. The most we can show,therefore, is that the soul is permanent throughout one’slife—a result that nobody will disagree with! What we wantis to show that the soul lasts after death, and this we cannotdo, for the reason I have given: the necessary tie betweenthe concept of substance and the concept of permanence iscreated by the principles of possible experience, and so itholds good only within the domain of possible experience.949Here’s something else that can be proved·as a requirementfor the intellectual management·of experience, but can’t beshown to hold of things in themselves:Our outer experiencenot only does but must correspond to something real outsideof ourselves. That tells us this much: there is somethingempirical—thus, some phenomenon in space outside us—·the existence of·which can be satisfactorily proved.·That’sall it tells us·, for we have no dealings with objects otherthan those belonging to possible experience; because objectsthat can’t be presented to us in any experience are nothingto us. What is empirically outside me is what appearsinspace. Now space, together with all the phenomena itcontains, belongs to the representations whose objectivetruth is proved by how they are inter-connected accordingto laws of experience, just as the actuality of my soul (as anobject of inner sense) is proved by how the phenomena ofinner sense are inter-connected. Accordingly,•it is by outerexperience that I am conscious of the actuality of bodies, asexternal phenomena in space, just as•by inner experienceI am conscious of the existence of my soul in time; but Iknow this soul only as an object of inner sense—knowingit only through appearances that constitute my inner state;9It is indeed very remarkable that metaphysicians have always glided comfortably over the principle thatsubstances are permanentwithout tryingto prove it. No doubt this is because as soon as they started on the concept of substance they found that every possible basis for a proof haddeserted them. Common sense, which strongly felt that perceptions couldn’t be unified in experience without this presupposition·of the permanenceof substance·filled the gap by a postulate. (·It had topostulatepermanence instead ofprovingit·because it could never derive the necessarypermanence of substance from experience itself, for two complementary reasons. (1) We have no way of tracking substances through all theiralterations and dissolutions and finding·empirically·that their matter, theirstuff, is never lessened. (2) The principle in question involvesnecessity,which is a sure sign of its being ana prioriprinciple·and thus not knowable through or provable from experience·.) People then optimistically appliedthis postulate·about all substances·to the concept of soul as asubstance, and inferred from this that a man’s soul must continue in existenceafter his death (especially because this substance’s having noparts—which they inferred from the indivisibility of consciousness—guaranteed thatit couldn’t be destroyed by falling to pieces). If they had found the genuine source of this principle of the permanence of substance—a discoveryrequiring deeper researches than they were ever inclined to make—they would have seen that the law of the permanence of substances holds goodonly for the purposes of·intellectually managing·experience; so it applies to things only so far as they are to be known and conjoined with others inexperience. It never applies independently of all possible experience, and consequently it cannot hold good of the soul after death.51"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?the nature of the soul in itself—the thing thathasthesephenomena—is unknown to me. So all thatCartesianidealismachieves is to distinguish•outer experience from•dreaming; and to distinguish the•conformity to law that isa criterion of the truth of the former from the•irregularityand false illusion of the latter. In·dealing with·both·outerexperience and dreaming·Cartesian idealism presupposesspace and time as required for the existence of objects; itsonly question is this:•Are the objects of the outer senses, which whenawake we put in space, actually to be found in space(as the object of inner sense, the soul,isactually tobe found in time)?That amounts to this:•Does experience carry with it sure criteria to distin-guish it from imagination?Doubts about this are easy to dispose of. We dispose of themin ordinary life every time we investigate how appearancesin both space and time are connected according to universallaws of experience: when the representation of outer thingsagrees thoroughly with those laws, we can’t doubt that theyconstitute truthful experience. So it is very easy to refutematerial idealism, which·questions the existence of bodies,although it doesn’t think of them as things in themselves,but·considers appearancesas appearancesand takes ac-count only of how they are connected in experience: it is justas sure an experience that bodies exist outside us (in space)as that I myself exist according to the representation of innersense (in time);·I put it like that because·the concept ofoutside usmeansexisting in space. Compare these two:•taking ‘body’ to refer not merely to outer intuition (inspace) but to the thing-in-itself that is the basis ofthis appearance—·the thing that the appearance is anappearanceof·,and•taking the ‘I’ in the proposition ‘I am’ to refer notmerely the object of inner intuition (in time) but tothe subject of consciousness—·the thing thathastheconsciousness·.The ‘body’ thought generates•the question of whether bodies(which are really phenomena of outer sense) exist as bodiesin natureapart from my thoughts—a question that can bebriskly answered in the negative. The ‘I’ thought generates•the question of whether I myself (an appearance of innersense, the soul that empirical psychology studies) exist apartfrom my faculty of representation in time; and this questionis on exactly the same footing as the other, and must likewisebe answered in the negative.Everythingis decided and certain in this way, once ithas been given its true meaning, Formal idealism (which Ihave also called ‘transcendental idealism’) actually abolishesmaterial (or Cartesian) idealism. For if space is nothing buta form of my sensibility, then it is—as a representation inme—just as actual as I myself am; and the only remainingquestion concerns the empirical truth of the representationsin space. And if on the other hand space and the phenomenain it are something existing outside us, then the actualityof these·alleged·objects outside us can never be proved·inthe way it wouldhave tobe proved, namely·by applying thecriteria of experience beyond the domain of our perception.II. The cosmological Idea50The cosmological Idea is the most remarkable product ofpure reason in its transcendent use. It has more power thananything else to rouse philosophy from its dogmatic slumber52"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?and to stimulate it to a hard task, namely making a critiqueof reason itself.I term this Idea ‘cosmological’ because it never takes itsobject from anywhere but the world of the senses, having nouse for anything that isn’t given to the senses. So in thatway itstays at home, does not become transcendent, and isto that extent not a mere Idea. (Whereas·the psychologicalIdeas don’t in that sense ‘stay at home’, because·merelyconceiving the soul as asimple substanceinvolves conceiv-ing something—the simple—that can’t be presented to thesenses.) Despite that, the cosmological Idea·does in its ownway go outside the domain of the senses, because it·extendsthe connection of the conditioned with its condition so farthat experience never can keep up with it. In this way, then,it is always an Idea, whose object can never be adequatelygiven in any experience.51Note first that in this territory·of the cosmological Ideas·theusefulness of asystem of categoriesis so obvious and unmis-takable that this alone would show that it is indispensable inthe system of pure reason, even if there weren’t several otherproofs of that. There are exactly four such transcendentIdeas, and exactly four classes of categories; but·the Ideasdiffer from the categories in that·they are concerned onlywith theabsolute completenessof the series of the conditionsfor a given conditioned item. Matching these cosmologicalIdeas there are exactly four kinds ofdialectical assertionsofpure reason. Their being dialectical shows in this:Against each of these assertions we can bring itscontradictory, on the strength of principles of purereason that are as plausible as those supporting theoriginal assertion.No exercise of metaphysical art can fend off this conflict·between the assertion and its contradictory·except the onethat compels the philosopher to look into the first sourcesof pure reason itself. This Antinomy—·i.e. this conflict be-tween dialectical assertions and their contradictories·—isn’tsomething I thought up to amuse myself: it comes from thenature of human reason; so it can’t be avoided or broughtto an end. The Antinomy contains the following fourthesestogether with theirantitheses:(1)Thesis: The world has abeginningin time and space(a limit).Antithesis: The world is spatially and temporallyinfinite.(2)Thesis: Everything in the world consists of·elementsthat are·simple.Antithesis: There is nothing simple; everything iscomposite.(3)Thesis: There are in the world causes throughfree-dom.Antithesis: There is no liberty; all isnature.(4)Thesis: In the series of the world’s causes there issomenecessary being.Antithesis: There is nothing necessary in the world; inthat serieseverything is contingent.52aWe have here the strangest phenomenon of human reason;no other use of reason produces anything like it. If we•think of the appearances of the world of the senses asthings in themselves (as we often do), and if we•take themto be combined through principles that hold universally forthings in themselves rather than merely through principlesof experience (which we also often do—indeed without mycritique we can’t help it!), there arises a conflict that can’tbe removed dogmatically·by proving one side and refuting53"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?the other·. That’s because thesis and antithesis canbothbe shown by equally clear, evident, and compelling proofs (Iguarantee that all the proofsarecorrect), so reason is dividedagainst itself—which gladdens the heart of the sceptic butmust make the critical philosopher feel ill at ease.52bWe can blunder in various ways in metaphysics withoutany fear of being detected in falsehood. For as long aswe avoid self-contradiction, which we can always do whenwe assert synthetic propositions (even if they are whollyfictitious),·our only way of being detected in falsehood isthrough experience. And·experience can’t refute us whenwe assert propositions·of the sort involved in metaphysics,namely ones·in which the concepts that are involved aremere Ideas, instances of which can’t be presented to us inexperience. For how can we tell from experience whether theworld has lasted from eternity or had a beginning, whethermatter is infinitely divisible or consists of simple parts? Suchconcepts can’t be instantiated in any experience, howeverextensive, and consequently neither the positive nor thenegative proposition·in the antinomy·can be empiricallydiscovered to be false. The only way in which reason couldunintentionally reveal its secret dialectic, which it falselyoffers as positive doctrine, would be for this to happen:Reason bases an assertion on a universally admittedprinciple, and infers the exactly opposite assertion,with the greatest correctness of argument, from an-other principle that is equally accepted.That’s what actuallydoeshappen in our present case ofthe four natural Ideas of reason, from which arise fourassertions and four counter-assertions, each validly derivedfrom universally accepted principles, revealing thedialecticalillusion of pure reasonin the use of these principles—anillusion that would otherwise have stayed hidden for ever.So this is a decisive experiment, which must necessarilyreveal to us any error lying hidden in the presuppositionsof reason.10Contradictory propositions can’t both be falseunless they both involve some self-contradictory concept.·And then theycanboth be false·. For exampleA squarecircle is roundis false (it is false that the circle is round,because it is square), andA square circle is not roundislikewise false (it is false that the circle isn’t round, i.e. that ithas corners, because it is a circle.) The logical mark of theimpossibility of a concept consists precisely in this, that twocontradictory propositions involving it are both false, and asno third proposition can be thought between them,nothingat allis thought through that concept.52cThe first two antinomies, which I call ‘mathematical’ becausethey are concerned with the addition or division of the ho-mogeneous, are based on such a self-contradictory concept;and that’s how it comes about that in each of them both thethesis and antithesis are false.[Re ‘homogeneous’: see the start ofthe next section’s second paragraph.]When I speak of objects in time and in space, I am speak-ing not about•things in themselves (of which I know nothing),but about•things in appearance, i.e. about experience as aparticular way of knowing objects—the only way of knowing10I should therefore like the critical reader·of theCritique of Pure Reason·to attend especially to this antinomy of pure reason, because nature itselfseems to have arranged it to pull reason up short in its bold claims, and to force it to look into itself. I take responsibility for every proof I have givenfor the thesis as well as for the antithesis, and thereby promise to show the certainty of the inevitable antinomy of reason. If this curious phenomenon·of the ‘proofs’ of both P and not-P·leads you to go back to examine the presupposition on which it is based, you will feel yourself obliged to join mein inquiring more deeply into the ultimate basis of all knowledge of pure reason.54"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?them that has been granted to mankind. When I think ofsomething as being in time or in space, I must not say·orthink·:In itself it exists in space and in time, independentlyof these thoughts of mine;for if I did I would be contradicting myself. That’s becausespace and time, together with appearances in them, are noth-ing existing in themselves and outside my representations,but are themselves only modes of representation[= ‘ways ofbeing represented-to’], and it is plainly contradictory to say thata mere mode of representation exists outside our representa-tion. So objects of the senses exist only in experience; andto attribute to them a self-subsisting existence•apart fromexperience or•in advance of it amounts to telling ourselvesthatexperienceis real apart from experience or in advanceof it!Now if I ask about the extent of the world in space andin time, my complete stock of concepts doesn’t enable me tocall it infinite or to call it finite. For neither state of affairscan be contained in experience: there can’t be experienceof aninfinitespace, or of an infinite time elapsed; or of theworld’s beingboundedby empty space or by empty timebefore the world began—all these are mere Ideas. This finiteor infinite size of the world,·not being cashable out in termsof experience·, would therefore have to belong to the worlditself apart from all experience. But this contradicts thenotion of•a world of the senses, which is merely a totality ofappearances that exist and are interconnected only in ourrepresentation, that is, in experience, since•this world isnot an object in itself but a mere mode of representation.From this it follows that the answer ‘Yes’ to the question ‘Isthe world finite in space or in time?’ is false, and so is theanswer ‘No’; because the concept ofa world of the sensesexisting for itself and in itselfis self-contradictory.The same holds good for the second antinomy, concerningthe division of appearances. For these appearances are mererepresentations, and their parts exist only in the represen-tation, and consequently exist onlyin the dividing, i.e. in apossible experience that presents them; and the dividing cango only as far as this experience goes. If you assume thatan appearance, such as that of a body, contains—in itself,in advance of all experience—all the parts that any possibleexperience can ever reach, what you are doing amounts tothis:Attributing to a mere appearance, which can exist onlyin experience, an existence preceding experience; orsaying that mere representations aretherebefore weencounter them through our faculty of representation.This is self-contradictory, and consequently so is eachanswer to the misconceived question·about divisibility·,whether we answer that bodies in themselves consist ofinfinitely many parts, or that they have a finite number ofsimple parts.53In the first (the mathematical) class of antinomies the false-hood of the assumed proposition consisted in•taking contra-dictory items (appearance, thing in itself) to be harmoniouslycompatible within a single concept. In the second (dynamic)group, on the other hand, the falsehood of the assumedproposition consists in•taking a consistent pair of proposi-tions to be mutually contradictory. Thus, in the first class ofantinomies the opposed assertions•were both false, while inthe second class the two propositions—which are treated asopposed to one another through mere misunderstanding—•may both be true.Connecting items mathematically through the conceptof·spatial or temporal·size requires that the connected55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?items be of the same kind; but dynamic connections by nomeans require that kind of homogeneity. When it comes toextended magnitudes—·i.e. stretches of space or of time·—allthe parts must be homogeneous with one another and withthe whole; but in the connection of cause and effect, although•homogeneity may be found there too, it isn’t necessary.Or at any rate the concept of causality doesn’t require it,because cause-effect has to do with positing somethingthrough something else•quite different from it.If the objects of the world of the senses were taken forthings in themselves, and the laws of nature discussed abovewere taken to be laws of things in themselves, contradictionwould be unavoidable. Similarly, if the subject of freedomwere taken to be a mere appearance, like other objects,contradiction would be equally unavoidable, for the samepredicate taken in the same sense would be at once affirmedand denied of one and the same object. But ifnaturalnecessityis tied only to appearances, andfreedomonly tothings in themselves, there’s no contradiction in assumingor allowing both kinds of causality at once, however hardor impossible it may be to make the latter kind (freedom)comprehensible.In·the realm of·appearance every effect is anevent, some-thing that happens in time; so according to the universallaw of nature it must be preceded by a cause, some state ofwhich leads to the event according to a constant law. But thecause’sentering into this statethat gives it its causal powermust likewisetake place or happen; the cause must havebegun to act, for without that the effect’s following from itcannot conceived.·Without such a beginning·, the effect, aswell as the effectiveness of the cause, would have to haveexisted always. This yields the result:•The state of the cause that makes it effective mustalso have started among appearances, being anevent(just as the effect is), and so have been caused in itsturn, and so on·backwards for ever·.Which in turn yields the further result:•The condition that governs the coming-into-effectiveness of causes must be natural necessity.If on the other hand, certain causes of appearances have theproperty of beingfree, then freedom must be a capacity forstarting these appearances—these events—spontaneously;there’s no such event as the cause’sstarting to be effective,and thus no need for anything outside the cause to prodit into starting to be effective. But in that case the causemust have its effectiveness in a manner that doesn’t placeit in time; so it can’t be an appearance, and must beregarded as a thing in itself, with only its effects beingappearances.11If we can without contradiction think ofbeings of the understanding—·choices, decisions, etc.·—as11The only acceptable use of the Idea of freedom is in·thinking about·the relation of theintellectual(as cause) toappearance(as effect)—·the relationbetween what aperson choosesand howhis body moves·. So the incessant action through which·any portion of·matter fills its space—·actingso as to keep other matter out of that place·—though it takes place from an internal principle[here = ‘source’ or ‘driver’], can’t be an exercise offreedom. Nor can we find a concept of freedom that is suitable for purely rational beings such as God. For his action, though independent of externaldetermining causes (because it is only his immanent or caused-from-within action that I am talking about), is determined in his eternal reason, thatis, in the divine nature·which never changes·. It is only if something is tostartby an action, so that the effect occurs in the time-series or in theworld of our senses (e.g. the beginning of the world), that the question arises of whether•the effectiveness of the cause must in its turn have beenstarted, or whether instead•the cause can initiate an effect without its own effectivenessbeginning. In the former case the concept of this causalityis a concept ofnatural necessity, in the latter, that offreedom. From this you will see that in explaining freedom as the faculty of starting an eventspontaneously I have exactly hit the notion which is the problem of metaphysics.56"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?exercising such an influence on appearances, then·thatenables us to have the second part of the following two-partstory·:•Natural necessity is what links all causes to all effects·when both cause and effect belong·in the world ofthe senses.•Freedom is possessed by any cause that isn’t itself anappearance though it underlies an appearance.Sonatureandfreedomcan without contradiction be at-tributed to the very same thing, but in different relations—onone side as an appearance, on the other as a thing in itself.We have in us a faculty that is not merely•connected with its subjective determining groundsthat are the natural causes of its actions, and isin that way the faculty of a being that belongs toappearances,but is also•connected to objective grounds (that are only Ideas),being connected to them in that they can determine[here = ‘influence’]this faculty—a connection expressedby the wordought.·To spell that out a little in more familiar terms: When aperson decides how to act on some occasion, the question‘Why did he make that decision?’—a request to know whatdeterminedhim to make it—can have answers of two entirelydifferent kinds.•One kind explains the decision in termsof his prior state of mind, and the psychological laws thatled from that to his decision.•The other kind explains thedecision in terms of hisreasonsfor it, his beliefs about whatheoughtto do. The former kind of answer invokes naturalnecessity; the second doesn’t, because it doesn’t explainthe decision as an event arising from prior events; it is thesecond that takes us out of the realm of appearance, andmakes room for freedom·. This faculty—·the one involvedin the second kind of answer·—is calledreason. To theextent that we consider a man exclusively in the light ofhis reason, viewed as responding to objective judgmentsabout what heoughtto do, to that extent we aren’t viewinghim as a being of sense—·an inhabitant of the world of oursenses·—because this freedom·or responsiveness to the‘ought’ thought·is a property of a thing in itself. We can’t atall grasp how it is possible—i.e. how theought, which is not·an event, not·something that hashappened, can determinethe man’s activity, becoming the cause of actions·whicharethings thathappen, and·whose effect is an appearance inthe world of the senses. Still,·although we don’t grasphowthis can be·, if reason did relate in this ‘influencing’ way toa person’s decisions, that would bringfreedominto whathappens in the world of the senses to the extent that wecan see those happenings as influenced by objective grounds(which are themselves Ideas). For reason’s effectiveness asa cause wouldn’t depend on subjective conditions—·i.e. onfacts about the person’s prior state of mind·—and thereforewouldn’t depend on events in time or on the law of naturethat controls such events. That’s because the grounds ofreason—·the basic ‘ought’ thoughts·—govern actions in auniversal way, according to·universal·principles, withoutinfluence from the circumstances of either time or place.What I am presenting here is meant merely as an exampleto make things intelligible. It doesn’t necessarily belong toour problem—·i.e. the questionHow is metaphysics in gen-eral possible?·—which must be decided from mere concepts,independently of the properties that we meet in the actualworld.Now I can say without contradiction that•all the actionsof rational beings, so far as they are appearances, fall under•the necessity of nature; but•those same actions, consideredpurely in terms of the rational subject and its ability to act57"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?according to mere reason, are•free. For what is required forthe necessity of nature? Only that every event in the worldof the senses come about in accordance with constant laws,thus being related to causes in the domain of appearance;and in this process the underlyingthing in itselfremains outof sight, as does its causality. But I maintain this:The law of nature still holds, whether or not the ratio-nal being causes effects in the world of the sensesthrough reason and thus through freedom. If itdoes, the action is performed according to maximswhose effects in the realm of appearance are alwaysconsistent withconstant laws; if on the other hand itdoesn’t, the action is·not merely consistent with but·subject tothe empirical laws of the sensibility, andin this case as in the other the effects hang togetheraccording to constant laws.This conformity to laws is all wedemand fornatural ne-cessity; indeed, it exhausts all that weknow aboutnaturalnecessity. But in•the former case·where the action iscaused by reason·, reason is the cause of these laws ofnature·rather than being subject to them·, and thereforeit is itself free; in•the latter case, where the effects followaccording to mere natural laws of sensibility with reasonhaving no input, it doesn’t follow that reason is in this casedetermined bythe sensibility, which indeed it couldn’t be, soreason is free in this case too. Freedom, therefore, doesn’tget in the way of natural law in the domain of appearance,any more than natural law brings about a breakdown inthe freedom of the practical use of reason, which relates tothings in themselves as determining grounds.Thus practical freedom—the freedom in which reason hascausal force according to objectively determining grounds—isrescued, without doing the slightest harm to natural neces-sity in relation to the very same effects, as appearances.These remarks explain what I said earlier about transcen-dental freedom and its compatibility with natural necessity(with a single subject taken in two different ways). Forwhenever a being acts from objective causes regardedas determining grounds·of reason·, the start of itsaction is afirst beginning,althoughthe same action is in the series of appearances only asubordinate beginning, which must be preceded anddetermined by a state of the cause, which in turn isdetermined by another immediately preceding it·andso on backwards·.In this way we can have the thought, for•rational beings andquite generally for•any beings whose causality is determinedin them as things in themselves, of a being’s ability to begin aseries of states from within itself, without falling into conflictwith the laws of nature. For the relation the action has toobjective grounds of reason isn’t a temporal one; in thiscase what determines the causality does not precede theaction in time, because determining grounds such as reasonprovides don’t involve•objects of sense such as causes inthe domain of appearance, but rather•determining causesas things in themselves, which don’t exist in time. And sothe action can without inconsistency be seen•(with regardto the causality of reason) as a first beginning and as free,and•(with regard to the series of appearances) as a merelysubordinate beginning and as subject to natural necessity.ThefourthAntinomy is solved in the same way as isreason’s conflict with itself in thethird. The propositions atissue in the fourth—·that there is a necessary being, andthat there is not·—are perfectly reconcilable provided wedistinguishthe cause IN the domain of appearancefromthecause OF the domain of appearance(with the latter thoughtof as a thing in itself). Then one proposition says:58"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?Nowhere in the world of the senses is there a cause (ac-cording to similar laws of causality) whose existenceis absolutely necessary;the other says:This world is nevertheless connected with a necessarybeing as its cause (but of another kind and accordingto another law).The ‘incompatibility ’of these propositions entirely rests onthe mistake of extending what is valid merely of appearancesto things in themselves, and in general running the twotogether in one concept.54This then is how Ipresentand how Isolvethe entire anti-nomy in which reason finds itself caught when it applies itsprinciples to the world of the senses. The mere presentationwould contribute a lot to the knowledge of human reason,even if the solution hadn’t yet fully satisfied you—whichit well might not, because you have to combat a naturalillusion that has only recently been exposed to you and thatyou have previously always regarded as genuine. For there’sno escaping from this: so long as you take the objects ofthe world of the senses to be things in themselves, andnot the mere appearances which is what they really are,you haven’t any chance of avoiding this conflict of reasonwith itself; so youmustre-examine my deduction of all oura prioriknowledge and the tests that I put it through, inorder to come to a decision on the question. This is allI require at present; for if in carrying this out you takeyour thoughts deeply enough into the nature of pure reason,you will familiarize yourself with the concepts through whichalone the solution of the conflict of reason is possible. Unlessthat happens, I can’t expect complete assent even from themost attentive reader.III. The theological Idea55·I have discussed the•psychological Idea(s) and the•cosmological Idea(s). Now·:The•third transcendental Idea is theidealof pure rea-son. The use of reason for which it provides material isthe most important of all; though if it is pursued in amerely·theory-building or·speculative manner, that makesit transcendent—·theorizing outside the domain of possibleexperience·—which in turn makes it dialectical. With thepsychological and cosmological Ideas, reason starts withexperience, and goes wrong by taking a grandiose viewof its grounds and trying to achieve, where it can, theabsolutely complete series of grounds. Not so with thethird, theological Idea. Here reason totally breaks withexperience; and—starting from mere concepts of what wouldconstitute the absolute completeness of a thing in general,and thus bringing in the Idea of•a most perfect primalbeing—it works down from there to secure the possibility andtherefore the actuality of•all other beings. And so the merepresupposition of a being that is conceived notinthe series ofexperience butfor the purposes ofexperience—for the sake ofcomprehending its connection, order, and unity—that is, theIdea, is distinguished from the concept of the understandingmore easily in this case than in the others. Hence wecan easily expose the dialectical illusion that arises fromour taking the subjective conditions of our thinking to beobjective conditions of objects themselves, and taking anhypothesis necessary for the satisfaction of our reason tobe an objectively established truth. I have nothing more tosay here about the pretensions of transcendental theology,because my remarks about them in the Critique are easilygrasped, clear, and decisive.59"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow is metaphysics possible?56:General remark on the transcendental IdeasThe objects given to us by experience are in many respectsincomprehensible, and the law of nature leads us to manyquestions·about them·which, when carried beyond a certainpoint (though still in conformity with those laws), cannotbe answered. For example: why do material things attractone another? But if we•go right outside nature, or•·staywithin it but·in thinking about how it is interconnectedgo beyond all possible experience and so enter the realmof mere Ideas,thenwe can’t say that our subject-matter isincomprehensible and that the nature of things confronts uswith insoluble problems. For in this case we aren’t dealingwith nature—or, to put it more generally, we aren’t dealingwith•given objects—but with•concepts that have their originsolely in our reason, and with mere creations of thought;and all the problems that arise from our concepts of themmust be soluble, because of course reason can and mustgive a full account of its own process.12As the psychological,cosmological, and theological Ideas are nothing but pureconcepts of reason that can’t be applied to anything foundin any experience, the questions that reason confronts uswith regarding them don’t come from objects but from meremaxims that our reason lays down for its own satisfaction. Itmust be possible for them all, as a group, to be satisfactorilyanswered, which is done by showing that they are principlesfor bringing our use of the understanding into thoroughharmony, completeness, and synthetic unity, so that theydo in that way hold good for experience—but for experienceas a whole. But although an absolute whole of experienceis impossible, the Idea ofa totality of knowledge accordingto principlesis needed if our knowledge is to have a specialkind of unity, the unity of asystem. Without that, ourknowledge is nothing but piece-work, and can’t be usedfor the highest end (which is always the establishment of ageneral system of all ends). I am talking here not only aboutpractical·or moral·ends, but also about the highest end ofthespeculativeuse of reason.The transcendental Ideas thus express reason’s specialrole, namely as setting a standard for systematic unity inthe use of the understanding. But if the following happens:We see this unity in our way of knowing as attachedto the object of knowledge; we take something that ismerelyregulativeto beconstitutive; and we persuadeourselves that by means of these Ideas we can extendour knowledge far beyond all possible experience (andthus in a transcendent manner),this is•a mere misunderstanding in our estimate of theproper role of our reason and of its principles, and it is•adialectic that confuses the empirical use of reason and alsosets reason against itself. What makes it a misunderstandingis the fact that really reason serves merely to bring experienceas near as possible to completenesswithin itself, i.e. to stopits progress from being limited by anything that can’t belongto experience.[A regulative principle is one that guides, advises, oreven commands—such as ‘Never accept that you have found an eventthat didn’t have a cause’. A constitutive principle is one that givesinformation, has factual content, purports to tell truths about reality.Kant holds, for example, that ‘Every event has a cause’ is acceptable asregulative, but not as constitutive.]12Herr Platner in hisAphorismsacutely says: ‘If reason is a criterion, there can’t be a concept that human reason cannot comprehend. Incomprehen-sibility comes up only with what is actual. . . .’ So it onlysoundsparadoxical and is not really strange to say that although much in nature is beyondour comprehension (e.g. biological reproduction), if we rise still higher and go right out beyond nature everything will be comprehensible again. Forthen we leave behind theobjectswhich can be given us, and occupy ourselves merely withIdeas; and here we can easily grasp the law that reason,through them, prescribes to the understanding for its use in experience, because that law is reason’s own product.60"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusionConclusionDetermining the boundaries of pure reason57After the clearest arguments, which I have provided, it wouldbe absurd for us to hope to know more of any object thanbelongs to the possible experience of it, or lay claim to theslightest knowledge of anything not taken to be an objectof possible experience—knowledge that would tell us whatthe thing is like in itself. For how could we learn such facts,given that time, space, and the categories—and even moreall the concepts drawn from empirical intuition orperceptionin the world of the senses—don’t and can’t have any useother than to make experience possible, and that even thepure categories are meaningless if they are removed fromthis relation to perception?But on the other hand it would be even more absurdif we rejected things in themselves, or declared that•ourexperience is the only possible way of knowing things,•ourintuition of them in space and in time the only possibleintuition,•our concept-using understanding the pattern forevery possible understanding—all of which would amountto taking the principles of the possibility of experience to beuniversal conditions of things in themselves.My principles, which limit the use of reason to possibleexperience, could in that way becometranscendent, and thelimits of our reason might pass themselves off as limits ofthe possibility of things in themselves (Hume’sDialogues·Concerning Natural Religion·illustrate this process), if acareful critique didn’tbothwatch over the bounds of ourreason. . . .andset a limit to its pretensions. Scepticism origi-nally arose from metaphysics and its lawless dialectic. Want-ing to favour the experiential use of reason, it started out bydeclaring that whatever transcends this use is worthless anddeceitful; but little by little, as the awareness sank in that thea prioriprinciples usedinexperience lead (surreptitiously,and seemingly just as legitimately)further thanexperienceextends, there came to be doubts even about experience.There’s no danger in this·error·, for healthy common sensewill doubtless always assert its rights·regarding experience·.But a certain confusion arose in science, which can’t workout how far reason is to be trusted—and why just this far andno further?—and the only way to clear up this confusion andforestall any future relapses is through a formal, principledfixing of the boundary of the use of our reason.It is true: we can’t rise above all possible experience andform a definite concept of what things in themselves may be.Nevertheless, we aren’t free to stop enquiring into them; forexperience never satisfies reason fully; rather, in answering·our·questions it points further and further back, leaving usstill hungering for their complete solution. You can see thisin the dialectic of pure reason, the solid subjective groundfor which consists in just this hunger for completeness. Asregards the nature of our soul: having a clear awarenessof oneself as a subject, and having become convinced thatpsychological phenomena can’t be explainedmaterialistically,•who can refrain from asking what the soul really is? Andif no concept ofexperiencesuffices for the purpose,•whocan refrain from accounting for it by a concept ofreason(the concept ofsimple immaterial being), even though weare totally unable to show its objective reality?

And•who doesn’t feel himself compelled, despite all the prohibi-tions against losing himself in transcendent Ideas, to seekpeace and contentment (beyond all the concepts that hecan vindicate by experience) in the concept of a being theIdea of which can’t be seen to be possible, but which can’tbe refuted either because it relates to a mere being of theunderstanding, without which·Idea·reason would remainforever dissatisfied?Where extended things are concerned,boundariesalwayspresuppose a space existing outside a certain definite place,and enclosing it;limitsdon’t require anything like that, butare mere negations, indicating of some quantity that it isn’tabsolutely complete. But our reason sees around itselfaspace for knowledge of things in themselves, so to speak,though it can never have definite concepts of them and islimited to appearances only.As long as the knowledge of reason is all of one kind—·forexample, reasoning within number-theory, within geometry,within natural science, or the like·—definite boundaries toit are inconceivable. In mathematics and in natural sciencehuman reason recognizeslimits, that is, recognizes thatits inner progress will never be complete; but it doesn’trecognizeboundaries, i.e. doesn’t recognize that outsideit there’s something it can’t ever reach. In mathematicsthere’s no end to the enlargement of our insight or to the newdiscoveries that may be made; similarly in natural science,there’s no end to the discovery of new properties of nature,of new forces and laws, through continued experience andunification of it by reason.·So these sciences are nevercomplete, which means that at any time they have limits·.But these limits should not be misunderstood—·i.e. shouldnot be thought of as boundaries·—for mathematics bearsonly onappearances, and so it has no dealings with anythingthat can’t be an object of sensible intuition, such as theconcepts of metaphysics and of morals,·which means thatit has no dealings with anything that could be a boundaryfor it·. Mathematics can never lead to such things, andhas no need for them. So there is a continual progress andapproachtowards·completion in·these sciences, towardsthe point or line, so to speak, of contact·with completeness·.The inwardness of things doesn’t show up in the domain ofappearance, though·the Idea of·it can serve as the ultimateground of explanation of appearances; and natural sciencewill never reveal it to us.

Indeed, even if such·ultimate grounds ofexplanation·wereto be offered from other sources (forinstance, if angels told us about them), natural sciencestill ought to reject them and not use them to advance•itsexplanations. For•those must be based only on what canbelong to experience as an object of sense and be connectedwith our actual perceptions in accordance with empiricallaws.But metaphysics, in the dialectical attempts of purereason (which we don’t undertake arbitrarily or wantonly,being driven to them by the nature of reason itself), leads ustoboundaries. And the transcendental Ideas, just becausewe can’t evade them and can never realize them·in the sense62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusionofencounteringan instance of one of them·, serve not only to•tell us that the pure use of reason has boundaries, but alsoto•show us where they are. That’s the purpose and functionof this disposition of our reason, which has given birth tometaphysics as its favourite child; and this child, like everyother in the world, is a product not of blind chance but ofan original seed that is wisely organized for great purposes.For metaphysics, perhaps more than any other science, hasin its main outlines been placed in us by nature itself, andcan’t be viewed as the outcome of an arbitrary choice or ofan accidental enlargement·of our thoughts·in the progressof experience—from which indeed it is wholly separate.Concepts and laws of the understanding suffice for theempirical use of reason, that is, for the use of it withinthe world of the senses; but they don’t satisfyreason itself,because it faces an infinite sequence of questions with nohope of ever completely answering them. The transcendentalIdeas, which have that completion as their aim, are suchproblems of reason. Now reason sees clearly that the world ofthe senses can’t contain this completion, neither (therefore)can all the concepts that serve only for understanding theworld of the senses—space and time, and the ones I have pre-sented under the label ‘pure concepts of the understanding’.The world of the senses is nothing but a chain of appearancesconnected according to universal laws; so it•has no existencefor itself,•isn’t really the thing in itself, and consequentlymust stand in a relation to·something other than itself,namely·to what contains the grounds of this experience—tobeings that can be known not merely as phenomena but asthings in themselves. It is only in the knowledge ofthesethat reason can hope to satisfy its demand for completenessin the advance from the conditioned to its conditions.In sections 33–4 above I indicated the limits of reason withregard to all knowledge of mere creations of thought.[Theword ‘limits’—Schranken—doesn’t occur in those two sections.]Now,since the transcendental Ideas have made it necessary for usto approach them, and thus have led us to the spot where•occupied space meets•the void, so to speak—i.e. where•experience touches•that of which we can know nothing,namely noumena—we can settle what the boundaries areof pure reason. For in allboundariesthere’s somethingpositive:for example, a surface is the boundary of corporealspace, andis itself a space; a lineis a spacethat isthe boundary of a surface; a point is the boundary ofa line but yetis always a placein space,whereaslimitscontain mere negations. The limits pointedout in sections 33 and 34 are still not enough[meaning ‘notenough to satisfy us’?]once we have discovered that there is stillsomething beyond them (though we can never know whatit is in itself). For the question now arises: How does ourreason conduct itself in this connection of what we knowwith what we don’t know and never shall? There is here anactual connection of the known with something completelyunknown (which will always remain so); and even if theunknown isn’t going to become the least bit known (andthere’s no hope that it will), the concept of this connectionmust still be capable of being identified and brought intoclarity.So we ought to have the thought of an immaterial being,a world of understanding, and a supreme being (all merenoumena), because•it is only in these items—as things inthemselves—that reason finds completion and satisfaction,which it can never hope for in deriving appearances fromgrounds that are homogeneous with them·and thereforedemand to be grounded in their turn·. Another reasonwhy we ought to ought to have those thoughts is that•·appearances·really do bring in something distinct from63"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusionthemselves (and totally unlike them), in that appearancesalways presuppose an object in itself·ofwhich the appear-ance is an appearance·, and thus they suggest its existencewhether or not we can know more of it.Now, we can neverknowthese beings of understandingas they are in themselves, i.e. determinately, but still wehave toassumethem in•relation to the world of the sensesand connect them with that world by means of reason; so weshall at least be able to think•this connectionby means ofsuch concepts as express their relation to the world of thesenses.·Thisrelationalapproach to noumena is the bestwe can do·. For if we think a being of the understanding•through nothing but pure concepts of the understanding, wereally think nothing definite, and consequently our concepthas no significance; and if we think it•through propertiesborrowed from the world of the senses, it is no longer a beingof understanding but is thought as one of the phenomenaand belongs to the world of the senses. I shall illustrate thiswith the notion of the supreme being.The•deistic concept—·i.e. the•thin concept of a (notnecessarily personal) supreme being·—is a wholly pure con-cept of reason; but all it represents isa thing containing allrealities. It can’t pick out any one reality—·thereby sayingsomething in detail about the supreme being·—because todo so it would have to use an example taken from the worldof the senses, and in that case I (·as a user of the concept inquestion·) would after all be dealing only with an object ofthe senses, not something of a radically different sort thatcan never be an object of the senses. Here’s an example:Suppose that I attributeunderstandingto thesupreme being. My only concept of understandingis one that fits understandings like mine—one thathas to get its intuitions·passively·from the senses,and that occupies itself·actively·in bringing thoseintuitions under rules of the unity of consciousness. IfI applied that concept to the supreme being, I would besaying that the raw materials of the supreme being’sthought come from the realm of appearance; but it wasthe inadequacy of appearances·to meet the demandsof reason·that forced me to beyond them to the con-cept of a being that doesn’t•depend on appearancesand isn’t•identified or characterized through them.·To credit the supreme being with understanding,therefore, I need a concept of understanding fromwhich the notion of getting-data-from-the-senses hasbeen purged·. But if I separateunderstandingfromsensibilityto obtain a pure understanding·that thesupreme being might have·, then nothing remains butthe mere form of thinking without intuitions; and formalone doesn’t enable me to know anything definite,and so it doesn’t enable me to point my thought at thesupreme being as an object.·On the one hand, then,I mustn’t suppose that the supreme being•thinksabout sensible intuitions; on the other, I mustn’t sup-pose that the supreme being•thinks without havingintuitions to think about. So·: for my purpose·of at-tributing understanding to the supreme being·I wouldhave to conceive another kind of understanding, suchas would·actively·intuit its objects·itself, instead ofpassively having intuitions of them brought to it bysensibility·. But I haven’t the least notion of suchan understanding, because human understanding isconceptual, its only way of knowing is through generalconcepts,·and it has no ability to present itself withintuitive data·.I shall run into exactly the same trouble if I attribute awillto the supreme being; for I have this concept only by drawingit from my internal experience; I experience will in myself as64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusionbased on facts of the formI shall not be satisfied unless I getobject x, which means that my will is grounded in sensibility,·through which desired objects are presented to me·; andthat·dependence on sensibility·is absolutely incompatiblewith the pure concept of the supreme being.Hume’s objections to deism are weak, and affect onlythe arguments and not the thesis of deism itself. But asregardstheism, which is supposed to come from addingcertaincontentto deism’s merely transcendent·and thusempty·concept of the supreme being, his objections are verystrong; indeed they are irrefutable as arguments againstcertain forms of theism, including all the usual ones. Humealways insists that•by the mere concept ofan originalbeing, to which we apply only ontological predicates (‘eternal,‘omnipresent’, ‘omnipotent’), we don’t think anything definite,and that•other properties must be added if we are to havea concept of a definite, concrete thing.·This isn’t a trivialrequirement, Hume holds. For example, he says that·it isn’tenough to sayIt is a cause; but we must explain what kind ofcausality it has—for example, whether it is exercised throughunderstanding and will—andthatis the point at which hisattack begins on his real topic, theism; up to there he hadbeen attacking only the arguments for deism, which isn’t anotably dangerous thing to do. All his dangerous argumentsrefer to anthropomorphism[from Greek meaning ‘man-shaped-ism’;in theology anthropomorphism is the view that God is like man]. Humeholds this to be inseparable from theism, and to make itinternally self-contradictory; and if anthropomorphism wereleft out·of the theological story·, theism would drop out withit, and nothing would remain but deism. We can’t makeanything out of deism: it is worthless, and can’t serve as afoundation for religion or morals. If this anthropomorphismwere really unavoidable, no proofs whatever of the existenceof a supreme being, even if they were all granted, could giveus a detailed concept of this being without involving us incontradictions.When we connect the commandto avoid all transcendentjudgments of pure reasonwith the apparently conflictingcommandto proceed to concepts that lie beyond the domainof immanent (empirical) use, we become aware that thetwo commands can subsist together, but only righton theboundary of all permitted use of reason—for this boundarybelongs equally to the domain of experience and to that of thecreations of thought[= Ideas]. And through that awarenesswe also learn how these Ideas, remarkable as they are, servemerely for marking the boundaries of human reason. Onthe one hand they give warning•not to go on extendingour empirical knowledge with no thought of boundaries, asthough nothing but sheerworldremained for us to know,and yet on the other hand•not to overstep the bounds ofexperience and want to make judgments about things beyondthem, as things in themselves.But we stopatthis boundary if we limit our judgmentmerely to how•the world may relate to•a being whose veryconcept lies beyond the reach of any knowledge we arecapable of within the world. For we don’t then attribute to thesupreme beingin itselfany of the properties through whichwe represent objects of experience, and so we avoiddogmaticanthropomorphism; but we attribute those properties to thesupreme being’srelation to the world, thus allowing ourselvesasymbolicanthropomorphism, which in fact concerns onlylanguage and not the object itself.When I say that we are compelled to view the worldasifit were the work of a supreme understanding and will,I actually say nothing more than that a watch, a ship, aregiment, are related to the watchmaker, the shipbuilder, thecommanding officer in the same way that the sensible world(or everything that underlies this complex of appearances) is65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusionrelated to the unknown; and in saying this I don’t claim toknow the unknown as it is•in itself, but only as it is•for meor•in relation to the world of which I am a part.58Such knowledge is knowledgeby analogy. This doesn’tinvolve (as the word ‘analogy’ is commonly thought to do)•an imperfect similarity of two things, but rather•a perfect similarity of relations between the membersof two quite dissimilar pairs of things.13By means of this analogy we are left with a concept of thesupreme being that is detailed enoughfor us, though wehave omitted from it everything that could characterize itabsolutelyorin itself; for we characterize only its relationto the world and thus to ourselves, and that is all we need.Hume’s attacks on those who want to determine this conceptabsolutely, taking the materials for doing so from themselvesand the world, don’t affect my position; he can’t objectagainst me that if we give up the objective anthropomorphismof the concept of the supreme being we have nothing left.Hume in the person of Philo in hisDialoguesgrants toCleanthes as a necessary hypothesis thedeisticconcept ofthe original being, in which this being is thought throughnothing but the ontological predicates of ‘substance’, of‘cause’, etc.·Two comments on this·:(1)Wemustthink the original being in this way; because·there’s no other way to think it, and if we don’t haveanythought of the original being·reason can’t have any satisfac-tion in the world of the senses, where it is driven by mereconditions that are in their turn conditioned,·thus driving usback along a never-starting sequence of causes·. If the use ofreason in relation to all possible experience is to be pushedto the highest point while remaining in complete harmonywith itself, the only possible way to do this is to assumea highest reason as a cause of all the connections in theworld. Such a principle must be thoroughly advantageous toreason, and can’t hurt it anywhere in its natural use.13Thus, there is an analogy between the legal relation of human acts and the mechanical relation of motive powers. I can never do something tosomeone else without giving him a right to do the same to me in the same circumstances; just as no body can act on another through its motivepower without thereby causing the other to react equally against it.Rightandmotive powerare quite dissimilar things, yet in their relation there iscomplete similarity. By means of such an analogy I can give a relational concept of things that are absolutely unknown to me. For example, asa = the promotion of the happiness of childrenis related tob = parental love,soc = the happiness of the human speciesis related tox = the unknown in God, which we call love.Not because (x) God’s love has the least similarity to (b) any human inclination; but because we can suppose its relation to the world to be similar toa relation that some things in the world have to some others. But the relational concept in this case is a mere category, namely the concept of cause,having nothing to do with sensibility.66"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusion(2)Wecan properlythink the original being in this way,because those predicates—·‘substance’, ‘cause’ etc.·—aremere categories, which yield a concept of the original beingthat isn’t determinate and for just that reason isn’t limitedto any conditions of sensibility. In thinking of the originalbeing in this way we don’t fall into anthropomorphism, whichtransfers predicates from the world of the senses to a beingquite distinct from that world. We aren’t transferring reasonas a propertyto the original being in itself, but onlyto itsrelationto the world of the senses; and so anthropomorphismis entirely avoided. For all we are considering here is thecauseof•something that is perceived everywhere in theworld, namely•the world’s rational form; and insofar asthe supreme being contains the ground of this rationalform of the world, reason is to be attributed to it. But insaying that the supreme being has reason, we are speakinganalogically, expressing only therelationthat the unknownsupreme cause has to the world, and we do this so as tosee everything in the world as being in the highest degreereasonable. This procedure doesn’t involve us in treatingreason as an attribute through which we can conceiveGod;what we do, rather, is to conceivethe worldin the waythat’s needed if we are to tackle it with the greatest possibleprincipled use of reason. In this way we admit that thesupreme being in itself is quite inscrutable and isn’t evenconceivablein any determinate way, and that keeps us from·two errors that we might otherwise make. Roughly andbriefly, they are the errors of trying to•explain God in termsof the world, and trying to•explain the world in terms of God.A little more fully,•one of the errors is that of·making a transcendent use of our concept of reasonas an efficient cause (by means of the will), tryingto describe the nature of God in terms of propertiesthat are only borrowings from human nature—therebylosing ourselves in gross and extravagant notions;and·the other error consists in·allowing our contemplation of the world to be floodedwith supernatural patterns of explanation, led by thetransfer to God of our notions of human reason—thereby deflecting this contemplation from its properrole, which is to study mere nature through·human·reason, not rashly to derive nature’s appearances froma supreme reason.The best way to put it, given our weak concepts, is this: weshould conceive the world AS IF its existence and its innernature came from a supreme reason.In thinking of it in this way, we achieve two things.•Werecognize what the world itself is like, without wanting todetermine what its cause is like in itself. And•we seethe ground of what the world is like (the ground of theworld’s rational form) in therelationof the supreme cause tothe world, not finding the world sufficient by itself for thatpurpose.14Returning now to what Philo granted to Cleanthes: We areperfectly free to predicate of this original being acausalitythrough reasonin respect of the world, thus moving on totheism; and this doesn’t oblige us to attribute this kind of·causally powerful·reason to the original being itself, as aproperty attached to it.Thus the difficulties that seem to stand in the way of14I shall say:•the causality of the highest cause relates to•the world in the same way that•human reason relates to its artifacts. That leaves thenature of the supreme cause itself still unknown to me: I only compare•its effect (the order of the world) which I know, and the conformity of this toreason, with•the effects of human reason, which I also know; and hence I call the supreme cause ‘reason’, without thereby attributing to it what Iunderstand by ‘reason’ as applied to man, or assigning to it any property of anything else that I know.67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusiontheism disappear. We achieve this by joining to Hume’sprinciple:Don’t push the use of reason dogmatically beyond thedomain of all possible experiencethis other principle, which he quite overlooked:Don’t consider the domain of experience as somethingwhich in the eyes of our reason sets its own bound-aries.The critique of reason here indicates the true middle waybetween•the dogmatism against which Hume fought and•the scepticism that he wanted to introduce to oppose it. Itisn’t the usual kind of ‘middle way’, which one is advised topick out for oneself as it were mechanically (a little of the one,a little of the other), making nobody any the wiser. Rather, itis a middle way that can be delineated exactly, according toprinciples.59At the beginning of this note I used the metaphor of abound-aryin order to fix the limits on the proper use of reason.[This ‘note’ is this Conclusion. Its title includes the term ‘boundaries’,but the concept isn’t discussed until pages 62–3.]The world of thesenses contains mere appearances, which aren’t things inthemselves; but the understanding must assume things inthemselves (noumena), because it recognizes the objectsof experience as appearances·and understands that theymust be appearancesofsomething·. Our reason covers both•appearances and•things in themselves, and the questionarises: How does reason go about setting boundaries tothe understanding with respect to both these domains?Experience, which contains all that belongs to the worldof the senses, doesn’t set bounds for itself; it proceeds inevery case from some conditioned item to some other·itemthat is its condition, and is also a·conditioned object;·andnothing in this procedure requires it ever to come to a halt·.The boundary of experience must lie•wholly outside it, andthat is•the domain of pure beings of the understanding. Butwhen it comes tofinding outwhat these beings are like, thisdomain is for us an empty space; and when we are dealingwith concepts whose instances we can identify and study,we can’t move out of the domain of possible experience. Buta boundary is itself something positive, which belongs asmuch to•what lies inside it as to•the space lying outside thegiven totality; so reason partakes in real positive knowledgewhen it stretches out to this boundary. Reason doesn’t try togo beyond the boundary, because out there it is confrontedby an empty space in which it can conceive•forms of thingsbut can’t conceive•things themselves. Still, even when itadopts this stance towards the boundary, just insettingthe boundary reason hasknowledge. In this knowledge itisn’t confined within the world of the senses, but it doesn’tstray outside it either; rather, as befits the knowledge ofa boundary, it focuses on therelation betweenwhat liesoutside the boundary and what’s contained inside it.Natural theology is such a concept at the boundary ofhuman reason,·because at that boundary·reason findsitself compelled to look out further towards the Idea of a•supreme being (and, for moral purposes towards the Idea ofa world that can be thought but not experienced). It doesn’tdo this so as to find out anything about this•mere creationof the understanding lyingoutsidethe world of the senses;its purpose is rather to employ principles of the greatestpossible (theoretical as well as practical) unity to guide itsconductwithinthe world of the senses—a purpose that isserved by relating these principles to an independent reason,as the cause of all the connections·found in the world of thesenses·. The aim isn’t to merelyinventa being·of reason.Invention isn’t in question here·, because beyond the world of68"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusionthe senses there mustbesomething that can be thought onlyby the pure understanding. Reason’s aim is tocharacterizethis being, though of course only by analogy.And so we are left with our original proposition, which isthe upshot of the whole critique:Reason, through all itsa prioriprinciples, neverteaches us about anything except objects of possibleexperience, and about these it teaches us nothingmore than can be known in experience.But this limitation on what reason can do doesn’t prevent itfrom leading us to the objectiveboundaryof experience, i.e.to therelationto something that is the ultimate ground ofall objects of experience without itself being one of them.Still, reason doesn’t teach us anything about what this‘something’ is likein itself—only about how itrelatestoreason’s own complete and utterly high-minded use in thedomain of possible experience. But this is all the usefulnesswe can reasonably want·reason to have·, and we have causeto be satisfied with it.60So I have fully exhibited metaphysics as something we cando,showing it as an automatic upshot ofthe natural tendencyof human reason, and showing what our essential goal iswhen we do metaphysics. But we have found that·thingscan go wrong in this pursuit·: thiswholly naturaluse ofsuch a tendency of our reason, if it isn’t reined in andgiven limits (which can come only from a scientific critique),entangles us in transcendentdialecticalinferences·leadingto conclusions·of which some are illusory and others areeven in conflict with one another; and this fallacious meta-physics is not a help but an obstacle to the advancementof our knowledge of nature. So it is worth our while toinvestigate thenatural goalstowards which we can steer thisliking that our reason has for transcendent concepts,·andthis will counteract the mishaps mentioned above·, becauseeverything that is natural must be originally aimed at someuseful purpose.Such an enquiry is risky, and I admit that what I cansay about it is only conjecture, like every speculation aboutnature’s original purposes. But this is permissible, just thisonce, because I am enquiring not into•the objective validityof metaphysical judgments but into•our natural tendency tomakesuch judgments, so that the enquiry belongs not to thesystem of metaphysics but rather to the study of mankind.The transcendental Ideas, taken all together, form thereal problem of natural pure reason, a problem that compelsreason to quit the mere observation of nature, to go beyondall possible experience, and in so doing to bring into existencethis thing (whether it is knowledge or sophistry!) calledmetaphysics. When I consider all of these Ideas, I think I seethatthe aim of this natural tendency—this metaphysics—is to free our thinking from the fetters of experienceand from the limits of the mere observation of nature,taking this freedom at least far enough to open upto us a domain containing only objects for the pureunderstanding, which no sensibility can reach.This is not so that we can speculatively occupy ourselveswith this domain (for we can find no ground to stand on whilewe do that), but so that we can think of moral principlesas at leastpossible.·The connection between their beingpossible and the domain opened up by metaphysics is asfollows·. Reason absolutely requires that moral principlesbe universal; and they can’t achieve universality unlessthey can fix their expectations and hopes on the domainof transcendental Ideas·because in the domain of experiencestrict universality is never to be found·.69"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusionNow I find that the•psychologicalIdea, little as it showsme of the nature of the human soul·thought of as some-thing·elevated above all concepts of experience, does plainlyenough show the inadequacy of these concepts, and in thatway steers me away from amaterialisttheory of mind—atheory that’s unfit to explain anything in nature, as wellas cramping the use of reason in moral thinking. The•cosmologicalIdeas serve similarly to keep us fromnatu-ralism, which asserts that nature is sufficient unto itself;they do this through·bringing home to us·the obvious factthat even if we had all possible knowledge of nature, reason’slegitimate demands wouldn’t be satisfied. Finally there is the•theologicalIdea,·whose service to us is as follows·. All nat-ural necessity in the sensible world is conditioned, becauseit always involves something’s being necessitated by some-thing else that is also conditioned; and thusunconditionalnecessity is to be looked for only in a cause that is differentfrom the world of the senses. And the causality of thiscause can’t be yet another example of natural necessity, forif it were it could never make comprehensible the existenceof the contingent (as its consequent). So the theologicalIdea,·which is the Idea of a non-natural cause of everythingcontingent·, is something that reason uses to free itself fromfatalism, and to arrive at the concept of a cause possessingfreedom, or of a highest intelligence. (This frees us fromboth versions of fatalism:(1)blind natural necessity inthe system of nature itself, without a first principle, and(2)blind causality of a first principle of nature.) Thus thetranscendental Ideas serve, if not to instruct us positively, atleast to put a stop to the impudent assertions ofmaterialism,ofnaturalism, and offatalism—assertions that restrict thedomain of reason—thereby making room for the moral Ideasto operate outside the domain of speculation. This, I shouldthink, goes some way towards explaining reason’s naturaltendency·to engage with Ideas·, which I mentioned earlier.The facts about the•practical or moral usefulness thata purely•speculative science can have don’t lie within theprovince of the science itself; so they can be seen simply asa scholium[= ‘explanatory note, marginal comment’]which, like allscholia, is not a part of the science itself. Still, this materialsurely lies within the boundaries of philosophy, especiallyof philosophy drawn from the well of pure reason—a part ofphilosophy in which reason’s•speculative use in metaphysicsmust necessarily be all of a piece with its•practical use inmorals. Hence the unavoidable dialectic of pure reason,considered as something occurring in metaphysics as anatural tendency, deserves to be explained not only as•anillusion that needs to be cleared away but also, if possible,as•·an upshot of·something put in place by naturefor apurpose—though this task lies outside the job-description ofmetaphysics proper, and so can’t rightly be assigned to it.The solutions of the questions put forward in theCritiqueat A647–68 = B675–96 should be regarded as a secondscholium—this time one that’s more closely related to thecontent of metaphysics.15For that part of theCritiquepresents certain principles of reason that characterizea priori•the order of nature or rather•the understanding which isto seek nature’s laws through experience. They seem to have15Throughout theCritiqueI stuck to my resolve not to neglect anything, however deeply hidden, that could enable the inquiry into the nature of purereason to be completed. Afterwards it is up to each person to decide how far to take his researches, once he has been shown what remains to bedone. This·attitude to further research·can reasonably be expected from someone who has made it his business to survey the whole field, so as toleave it to others for future cultivation and for whatever subdividing of it they think fit. The scholia belong to this·part of the total project·; becauseof their dryness they can hardly be recommended to amateurs, and hence they are presented only for experts.70"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantConclusionpropositional content and not merely to be rules for how theunderstanding should be employed, and to be law-giving withregard to experience, although they spring from mere reason,which cannot like the understanding be considered as aprinciple of possible experience. This agreement·betweenprinciples issued by reason and what is found in experience·may rest on this:Nature isn’t attached to appearances (or to the sensi-bility through which appearances come) in themselves,but is to be found only in the relation of sensibilityto the understanding.·And just as nature takes usupwards from sensibility to understanding, so thetheoretical use of the understanding takes us furtherupwards to reason·. A thoroughgoing unity in the useof the understanding for the sake of a systematicallyunified possible experience can be had only if•theunderstanding is related to reason. And so,·puttingthe two together·, experience is indirectly subject tothe legislation of reason.The question of whether thisiswhere the agreement comesfrom may be pondered by those who want to trace the natureof reason even beyond its use in metaphysics, into the gen-eral principles for making general natural history systematic.In theCritiqueI represented this task as important, but Ididn’t try there to carry it out.And thus I conclude the analytic solution of my ownchief question:How is metaphysics in general possible?bystarting with the actual doing of metaphysics (or at leastwith the consequences of that) and climbing from there tothe grounds of its possibility.[See the explanation of ‘analytic’, inthis sense of the word, on page 6.]71"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow metaphysics is possible as a scienceSolution of the general question of theProlegomena:How is metaphysics possible as a science?Metaphysics as a natural tendency of reason is real, but byitself it is dialectical and deceitful (as the analytic solution ofthe third principal question showed). If we set ourselvesto take principles from it, and in using them to followthe natural (but nonethelessfalse) illusion, we can neverproduce science, but only a pointless dialectical art in whichone school may outdo another but none can ever get, and beentitled to, lasting approval.For metaphysics as a science to be entitled to claim notmere fallacious plausibility but insight and conviction, acritique of reason itself must exhibit•the whole stock ofa prioriconcepts,•the classification of them according to their differentsources (sensibility, understanding, and reason),•a complete list of these concepts, and•the analysis of each of them together with all theconsequences of that analysis;but above all the critique must show•the possibility of synthetica prioriknowledge (doingthis through a deduction of these concepts),•the principles governing the use of thea prioricon-cepts, and finally•the boundaries of that use;and all of this is to be presented in a complete system!Thus criticism, and that alone, contains in itself the wholewell-tested and verified plan for achieving metaphysics asa science—the plan and indeed all the means for carryingit out. By any other ways or means the task is impossible.[Here and below, ‘criticism’ translatesKritik, which is usually renderedas ‘critique’.]So the question here isn’t so much•how the taskis possible as•how to get it under way, inducing good mindsto quit their mistaken and fruitless cultivation in favour ofone that won’t deceive, and•how such an alliance for thecommon end may best be directed.This much is certain, that someone who has sampledcriticism will for ever after be disgusted with all the dogmatictwaddle that he used to endure—hehadto endure it becausehis reason was in need of something and couldn’t findanything better·than the twaddle·for its nourishment.Criticism relates to ordinary academic metaphysics ex-actly as chemistry does to alchemy, or as astronomy does tothe astrology of the fortune-teller. I guarantee that when youhave thought through and grasped the principles of criticism,even if only in these preliminaries, you will never returnto that old and sophistical pseudo-science·of dogmaticacademic metaphysics·; rather, you will look forward witha certain delight to a metaphysics that is now surely inyour power, that requires no more preparatory discoveries,and, above all, that can provide reason with permanentsatisfaction. For here is an excellence that metaphysics canconfidently count on and that no other possible science can:it can be completed and put into a permanent state wherethere are no more changes to be made, and no additionsthrough new discoveries. That’s because in metaphysicsreason has the sources of its knowledge in itself, not inobjects and the intuition of them (reason hasnothingto learnfrom intuition); and when it has presented the fundamentallaws of its own capacities completely, and so definitely as toprevent any misunderstanding, there’s nothing left for purereason to knowa priori—indeed, there isn’t even any basis72"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow metaphysics is possible as a scienceleft for it to ask any further questions. There’s somethingespecially attractive about the sure prospect of knowledgethat is so definite and so completed—even apart from all itsadvantages (of which more later).All false art, all empty ‘wisdom’, lasts its time out buteventually destroys itself, and its cultural high-point comesat the moment of·the onrush of·its decay. That this timehas come for metaphysics is shown by the condition intowhich it has fallen in all the learned nations, in contrastwith all the zeal with which other sciences of every kindare pursued. The old organization of university studies stillpreserves its shadow; and now and then a solitary academyof science, by offering prizes, tempts someone or other tohave a shot at it; but it is no longer counted among the solidsciences. You can judge for yourself how a gifted man wouldtake it if he were called ‘a fine metaphysician’! It might bemeant as a compliment, but hardly anyone would want tobe so labelled.Yet, though•the time of the collapse of all dogmatic meta-physics has undoubtedly arrived, we are still far from beingable to say that•the time has come for its rebirth througha solid and complete critique of reason. When someone’sinclinations shift from running one way to running in theopposite direction, he passes through an intermediate stageof indifference·in which he isn’t inclined in any direction.And this fact about human desires and tendencies hasits analogue in shifts of intellectual direction among thesciences·. This moment·of ‘indifference’, with an old scienceon the wane and no new one to take its place·, is•the mostdangerous for an author, but in my opinion it’s•the mostfavourable for the science. For when the total breaking offormer ties has extinguished the partisan spirit, minds arein the best state to take in, gradually, proposals for a newscheme of alliances.If I say:I hope that these preliminaries may excite investiga-tion in the domain of criticism, and provide somethingnew and promising to nourish the universal spirit ofphilosophy that seems·except for moral philosophy·to be under-nourished,I can already imagine that everyone who is tired and crossfrom walking the thorny paths of my critique will ask me:What’s your basis for hopingthat? I answer:The basis ofthe irresistible law of necessity.Will the human mind ever give up metaphysical re-searches altogether? There’s no more chance of that thanthere is of our choosing to give up breathing altogether so asto avoid inhaling impure air! So there will always be meta-physics in the world; what’s more every person—especiallyevery thinking person—will have metaphysical views, and inthe absence of a public standard he will tailor them to suithimself. What has been called ‘metaphysics’ up to now can’tsatisfy any demanding mind, but it’s quite impossible togive up metaphysics completely; so a critique of pure reasonitself must now beattempted; or if one exists it must beinvestigatedand comprehensively tested. There’s no otherway to meet this pressing need, which is something morethan mere thirst for knowledge.Ever since I have come to know criticism, when I finishreading a book with metaphysical content—one that hasentertained and enriched me by its precision of thought,variety, orderliness, and easy style—I can’t help asking:Hasthis author really advanced metaphysics a single step?Ihope they will forgive me—those learned men whose writingshave been useful to me in other respects and have alwayshelped me to develop my mental powers—for saying that Ihave never been able to find that the science of metaphysicshas been advanced in the least by their works or by my own73"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow metaphysics is possible as a sciencelesser ones (even when my egotism speaks in their favour!).The reason for this is very obvious: it is that metaphysicsdidn’t then exist as a science; and·those other writers and Icouldn’t make small steps towards bringing it into existence,because·it can’t be assembled bit by bit, but must haveits seed fully preformed in the critique. However, in orderto prevent any misunderstanding we should bear in mindsomething I have already said: the understanding gains agreat deal from the analytic treatment of our concepts, butthe science (of metaphysics) isn’t in the least advanced byit, because these analyses of concepts are merely materialsout of which the science is to be assembled in the first place.Let the concepts of substance and of accident be ever sowell analysed and fixed; that’s an excellent preparation forsome future use. But if I can’t prove thatin everythingthat exists the substance endures and only the propertieschange, our science isn’t the least advanced by all thisanalysis. Metaphysics has so far not been able to provea priorieither•the above proposition, or•the principle ofsufficient reason, still less•any compound principle such asbelongs to psychology or cosmology, or indeed•any syntheticproposition whatsoever. So all this analysis has achievednothing, created and advanced nothing; and despite all thisbustle and clatter the science is right back where it was inAristotle’s time; though the preparations for it would havebeen better advanced·now·than they were·back then·, ifonly the guiding thread to synthetic knowledge had beenfound.If anyone thinks himself wronged in this, he can easilyrefute my charge by producing a single synthetic propositionbelonging to metaphysics that he offers to provea prioriin the dogmatic manner. Until he has done this I shan’tgrant that he has really advanced the science; even if theproposition·that he claims to be able to prove·is sufficientlyconfirmed by common experience. No demand can be moremoderate or fairer than this, and if it isn’t fulfilled (as it quitecertainly won’t be), the fairest verdict we can give is this:Upto now, metaphysics has never existed as a science.In case my challenge is accepted, I must rule out just twothings.(1)One is: playing around with probability and conjecture,which are as little suited to metaphysics as they are togeometry. Nothing can be more absurd than to think ofgrounding our judgments on probability and conjecture inmetaphysics, which is a philosophy based on pure reason. Everything that is to be knowna prioriis for that veryreason announced as absolutely certain, and must thereforebe proved as such. We might as well think of basing geometryor arithmetic on conjectures! The calculus of probability,which is part of arithmetic, contains no•merely probablejudgments. Rather, it consists of•completely certain judg-ments about the degree of possibility of certain upshots ingiven homogeneous conditions. What happens across thetotality of all possible casesmustbe in accordance withsuch rules·or judgments·, though these aren’t determinateenough to say what will happen in any particular case. Onlyin empirical natural science can conjectures be tolerated(they come in there through induction and analogy), andeven there it must at least be quite certain that what one isassumingcouldbe true.(2)The second thing I rule out is decision by means ofthe divining rod of so-calledsound common sense, whichdoesn’t dip·in the same place·for everyone and is guided by·the·personal qualities·of the person holding it·. When weare dealing with concepts and principles not considered asvalid with regard to experience but considered as valid evenbeyond the conditions of experience, appealing to•commonsense is even more absurd·than relying on probability·, if74"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantHow metaphysics is possible as a sciencethat’s possible. For whatiscommon sense? It isordinaryunderstandinginsofar as it judges correctly. But what is•ordinary understanding? It is the capacity for knowledgeand for using rules in application to particular cases, asdistinguished from•speculative understanding, which isthe capacity for knowledge of rules in the abstract. Socommon sense can hardly understand the rule thateveryevent is determined by its cause, and can never take it in asa general proposition. It therefore demands an example fromexperience; and when it·is given one, and·hears that thisrule means nothing but what it (·common sense·) alwaysthought when a window-pane was broken or an article offurniture went missing,thenit understands the principleand agrees to it.•Ordinary understanding is thus of useonly to the extent that it can see its rules confirmed byexperience (though actually the rules are in ita priori);consequently the job of having insight into these rulesa prioriand independently of experience is assigned to•speculativeunderstanding, and lies quite outside the domain of visionof common sense. But metaphysics has to do only withspeculative understanding; and someone who appeals tocommon sense for support in metaphysics shows that hedoesn’t have much of it! For in this context common sensehas no judgment at all; and·when it is invoked, there is akind of bad faith in that, because·it is looked down on withcontempt except when people are in difficulties and don’tknow where else to turn for advice or help.These false friends of common sense (who occasionallyprize it highly, but usually despise it) customarily offer thisexcuse·for sometimes appealing to it·:There must in the end be some propositions that areimmediately certain, and for which there’s no need togive any proof, or even any account at all; because ifthere were not, there would be no end to the groundsfor our judgments.·And these immediately certainpropositions are the ones we know to be true throughour common sense·.But these people can never prove their right to say this bypointing to anything indubitable that they can immediatelyascribe to common sense—with two exceptions·that areirrelevant to our present concerns·.•One is the principleof contradiction, which·we can set aside because it·isinadequate for showing the truth of synthetic judgments.•The other is comprised of mathematical propositions, suchas that twice two make four, and that between two pointsthere is only one straight line, etc. But these judgmentsare vastly different from those of metaphysics. For inmathematics when I conceptually represent something tomyself as possible I can also make it, construct it, in mythought: to onetwoI add the othertwo, one by one, and somyself make the numberfour; or from one point to anotherI draw in thought all kinds of lines, and can draw only onein which every part is like every other part·which meansthat the line is straight·. But·no such construction has aplace in metaphysics, as I shall explain through the exampleof the concept of causation·: with all my power of thinkingI can’t extract from the concept of one thing the conceptofsomething elsewhose existence is necessarily connectedwith the first thing; rather,·if I want a basis for connectingsomething with something else·I must call in experience.Now, my understanding provides mea priori(yet always onlyin reference to possible experience) with the concept of such aconnection·between different things·, namelycausation. ButI can’t exhibit this concepta prioriin intuition, thus showingits possibilitya priori, as I can the concepts of mathematics.In metaphysics the concept of causation (together with theprinciples of its application) has to be valida priori, andforthatthere must be a justification and deduction of its75"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantMaking metaphysics actual as a sciencepossibility—for otherwise we can’t know what its range ofvalidity is,·e.g.·whether it can be used only in experienceor also outside it. Such a•justification and deduction arenothing remotely like the•intuitive construction throughwhich we can show possibility in mathematics.[See the longnote on page??.]In metaphysics as a speculative science of pure reason,therefore, we can never appeal to common sense. Wecanmake such an appeal whenwe are forced to•abandonpure reasonand to re-nounce all purely speculative knowledge (which mustalways beknowledge·strictly so-called·, which in-volves renouncing metaphysics itself and its teachingon certain matters,·this ‘forcing’ coming about because·we find that all we can achieve is•reasonable belief—which suffices for our needs and may indeed be morewholesome for us than knowledge·strictly so-called·.When we make that switch, the shape of the situation iscompletely altered. Metaphysics must be science, over-alland in each part; otherwise it is nothing. That is becausemetaphysics, as speculation of pure reason, has nothingto hold it steady exceptuniversalinsights. Beyond itsdomain, however, probability and common sense can beused legitimately and to good effect, but following principlesof their own, the importance of which always depends ontheir reference to practical life.That’s what I consider myself entitled to require for thepossibility of metaphysics as a science.Appendix:On what can be done to make metaphysics actual as a scienceAs none of the paths that have so far been followed havereached the goal·of metaphysics as a science·, and sinceit never will be reached except through a preceding cri-tique of pure reason, it seems reasonable to ask that thispresent attempt·at such a critique·be examined carefullyand accurately—unless you think it better to give up allpretensions to metaphysics, which is all right as long as youstick to it.If we take the course of things as it is, not as it oughtto be, there are two sorts of judgments:(1)a judgment thatprecedes the investigation,(2)a judgment that comes afterthe investigation. In our case(1)is what happens when thereader pronounces judgment on theCritique of Pure Reasonon the basis of his own metaphysics, though the possibilityofthatis what theCritiqueaimed to investigate. In(2)·inour case·the reader is able to•set aside for a while theconsequences of the critical enquiries, which may clashviolently with the metaphysics that he used to accept, and•first examines the grounds from which those consequencescan be derived. If what ordinary metaphysics offers were76"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantMaking metaphysics actual as a sciencedemonstrably certain (like the theorems of geometry, forinstance), judgments of kind(1)would be legitimate; for if theconsequences of certain principles conflict with establishedtruths, the principles are false and can be rejected withoutfurther enquiry. But if•metaphysics doesn’t have a stock ofindisputably certain (synthetic) propositions, and if•it is eventhe case that a number of the propositions of metaphysics—though as plausible as the best of them—have consequencesthat conflict with one another, and if•metaphysics containsabsolutely no criterion for the truth of specifically metaphysi-cal (synthetic) propositions, then the(1)kind of judging isn’tadmissible, and·the(2)method should be followed, thatis·the investigation of the principles of theCritiquemustprecede all judgments as to its worth or unworth.·In theremainder of this Appendix I shall present an actual exampleof(1), followed by a proposal for an example of(2)·.On a sample of a judgment of theCritiqueprior to itsexaminationThis judgment occurs in an·anonymous review·in theGöttingen Scholarly Newsfor January 1782. . . . When anauthor who knows the subject-matter of his work and hasworked hard to present his own thoughts in it falls into thehands of a reviewer who for his part•is sharp enough to seethe points on which depend the value (if any) of the book,who•doesn’t hang on thewordsbut goes for thecontent, and•confines himself to sifting and testing the principles fromwhich the author started, the author may dislike the severityof his judgment but the public doesn’t mind it because herethe public is the winner. And the author can be glad that anopportunity to correct or explain his work has come throughthe examination of a competent judge. If he thinks he ismainly right, he can in this way remove any obstacles thatmight eventually hurt the success of his work.It’s not like that with my reviewer. He seems to havemissed entirely the real point of my enquiry. Perhaps hewas impatient with thinking his way through a lengthy work;or angry at the threatened reform of a science in which hethought he had settled everything long ago; or—what I reluc-tantly believe is the case—narrowness of grasp stopped himfrom carrying his thoughts beyond his school metaphysics.Anyway, he•impetuously whips through a long series ofpropositions which no-one cd grasp without knowing theirpremises, and•scatters around his condemnations withoutgiving understandable reasons. So his review is no use tothe reader, and doesn’t do the slightest harm to me in thejudgment of experts. So I would have passed over this reviewcompletely if it hadn’t given me an opportunity to providesome clarifications that may save some readers of thesePreliminariesfrom misinterpretations.Wanting to position himself so as to set the whole workin a light that is most unflattering to its author, doing thiseasily without putting any work into it, Reviewer begins andends by saying: ‘This work is a system of transcendental (or,as he translates it, of higher) idealism.’1616‘Higher’—no way! High towers, and metaphysically-great men that resemble them, are not for me—there is usually too much wind around them! Myplace is the fertile bottom-land of experience; and the word ‘transcendental’—whose meaning was so often explained by me but not once grasped byReviewer (so carelessly has he looked at everything)—doesn’t signify something that•goes beyond all experience, but something that•does indeedprecede experiencea priori, but whose role is simply•to make knowledge through experience possible. If these concepts step beyond experience,their employment is termedtranscendent, as distinct from theirimmanentuse, that is, their use limited to experience.·Don’t confuse ‘transcendent’with ‘transcendental’·. All misunderstandings of this kind have been adequately guarded against in the work itself, but it suited the reviewer’s turnto misunderstand me.[The use here of ‘Reviewer’, as though it were a proper name, is Kant’s. He will do this once more.]77"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantMaking metaphysics actual as a scienceA glance at this line showed me what sort of reviewwas in store for me. It was like someone who has neverseen or heard of geometry, finds a copy of Euclid and onflipping through its pages sees various figures, is askedhis opinion of it, and replies: ‘The work is a text-book ofdrawing; the author uses a special language in which to givedark, incomprehensible directions that in the upshot teachnothing more than what everyone can accomplish with agood natural eye, etc.’Meanwhile, let us see what sort of idealism it is that runsthrough my whole work, although it is far from constitutingthe soul of the system.The thesis of all genuine idealists from the Eleatic schoolto Bishop Berkeley is contained in this formula:All knowledge through the senses and experience isnothing but sheer illusion, and only in the ideas ofthe understanding and reason is there truth.The principle that governs and determinesmyidealismthroughout is on the contrary:All knowledge of things through unaided pure under-standing or pure reason is nothing but sheer illusion,and only in experience is there truth.This is precisely the opposite of the former, genuine idealism.So how did I come to use this expression for a completelyopposite purpose, and how did my reviewer come to seegenuine idealism everywhere?The solution of this difficulty rests on something thatcould have been very easily understood—by anyone whowanted to!—from the over-all structure of the work. Spaceand time, together with everything they contain, are notthings or qualities in themselves, but belong merely to theappearances of such things and qualities; up to this point Iam doctrinally at one with the·genuine·idealists. But they,and especially Berkeley, regarded space·itself·as a mereempirical representation, and held that it together with allits properties is known to us only by means of experience orperception—just like the appearancesinspace. As againstthis, I show in the first place, thatspace (and also time, which Berkeley ignored) and allits properties can be known by usa priori, becausespace (as well as time)•is present in us before all per-ception or experience as apure form of our sensibilityand•makes possible all sensible intuition and thusall appearances.It follows from this·contrast between Berkeley and me·that•because truth rests on universal and necessary laws asits criteria, experiencefor Berkeleycan have no criteriaof truth, because its appearances (according to him) havenothing underlying thema priori, from which it follows inturn that they are nothing but sheer illusion; whereasformespace and time (in combination with the pure concepts ofthe understanding) prescribe their lawa priorito all possibleexperience, and this at the same time yields the sure criterionfor distinguishing truth from illusion in experience.17My so-called idealism (properly:criticalidealism) is thusof a quite special kind, in thatit overthrows ordinary idealism; and through it alla prioriknowledge, even that of geometry, first re-17Genuine idealism always has a visionary purpose; it is bound to. But my idealism is designed solely for grasping the possibility of oura prioriknowledge of objects of experience—a problem that has never been solved before, and never even been posed. In this way all visionary idealismcollapses. As was already to be seen in Plato, visionary idealism inferred from our·having·a prioriknowledge (even that of geometry)·that thereis·another intuition different from that of the senses, namely an intellectual intuition. It never occurred to any of them that the senses themselvesmight intuita priori·as I say they do, for example in geometry·.78"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantMaking metaphysics actual as a scienceceives objective reality; and even the most zealous·ordinary·realists couldn’t have claimedthat, becausethey lacked my demonstrated ideality of space andtime—·that is, my proof that space and time are formsof our sensibility·.In these circumstances I would have liked, so as avoid allmisunderstanding, to name this concept of mine differently;but I can’t very well alter the name totally. So I may bepermitted in future to call it ‘formal idealism’ (·as I did onpage 52·) or, better, ‘critical idealism’, to distinguish it fromthe dogmatic idealism of Berkeley and the sceptical idealismof Descartes.I find nothing else worthy of comment in this reviewof my book. All the way through the reviewer presentsblanket judgments—a smart procedure for a reviewer touse, because it doesn’t reveal the state of his knowledge orignorance;·whereas·a single criticism that was thoroughand detailed, if it concerned the main issue (as it oughtto), might have exposed error in my work, and might alsohave revealed the reviewer’s level of skill in this sort ofenquiry. Another well-conceived device for removing earlyon the readers’ desire to read the book itself—readers whousually form their conceptions of books merely from news-paper articles—is•to pour out all in one breath a numberof propositions, torn out of the context of their groundsof proof and explanations, which are bound to strike thereader as nonsensical (especially considering that they arepoles apart from all·ordinary·school-metaphysics),•to makethe reader disgusted with the demands on his patience adnauseam, and then, after presenting·and attributing tome·the brilliant proposition thatconstant illusion is truth(which was news to me!),•to conclude with the firm, fatherlyrebuke: ‘What’s the point, then, of this quarrel with acceptedlanguage, what’s the point—and what’s the source—of theidealistic distinction?’ After a first judgment that all that isspecial in my book is metaphysically heretical, now at theend it is said to be a mere change of language; which clearlyproves that my would-be judge hasn’t the slightest grasp ofit, and hasn’t even understood himself.18Reviewer speaks like a man who must be aware of havingimportant and excellent insights—but ones that he keepshidden, for I don’t know of anything recent relating tometaphysics that would justify his tone. It is wrong forhim to withhold his discoveries from the world, for there aredoubtless many others like me who haven’t been able to find,in all the fine things that have been written in this branchof philosophy, anything that has advanced the science·ofmetaphysics·by so much as a finger-breadth. What wedofind are•definitions sharpened,•lame proofs fitted out withnew crutches,•the crazy-quilt of metaphysics supplied withnew patches or with a change of pattern; but none of thisis what the world requires! The world has had enough ofmetaphysical assertions; what is wanted is·to establish·•the possibility of this science,•the sources from whichcertainty could be derived in it, and•sure criteria by whichto distinguish the dialectical illusion of pure reason fromtruth. The reviewer must have the key to all this; otherwisehe would never have spoken in such a high tone.But·joking aside·I am inclined to suspect that no suchrequirement for the science·of metaphysics·has ever enteredhis head. If it had,he would have focussed on this matter in his review,and·if he thought I had been wrong about it·evena failed attempt in such an important affair would18[Kant has a footnote here, protesting at two of the reviewer’s misunderstandings.]79"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantMaking metaphysics actual as a sciencehave won his respect. If that is how things stand,we are good friends again. He can think his way asdeeply as he likes into his metaphysics; no-one willstop him; but he can’t make judgments about thesource of metaphysics in reason, for that lies outsidemetaphysics.·That’s if the requirements for a science of metaphysicshadentered his head·. But my suspicion·that theydidn’t·isnot unfounded, as is shown by the fact that he doesn’tsay a word about•the possibility of synthetic knowledgeapriori, though this was•the real problem on the solution ofwhich the fate of metaphysics wholly rests, and to which myCritique(along with the presentPreliminaries) was entirelydirected. The idealism that he stumbled on·in theCritique·,and was pinned down by, was incorporated in the systemonly because it was the sole means for solving•the aboveproblem (though it was later confirmed on other grounds);so·if he had understood what was going on·he would haveto have shown either that the problem isn’t as importantas I make it out to be in theCritique(and again now inthesePreliminaries), or that myappearanceconcept doesn’tsolve it at all or provides a solution that is inferior to someother. But I don’t find a word of this in the review. So thereviewer understoodnothingof what I wrote, and perhapsalso nothing of the spirit and nature of metaphysics itself;unless (and I would rather think this) a reviewer’s haste,and annoyance at the difficulty of working through so manyobstacles, threw an unfavourable shadow over the work lyingbefore him, hiding from him its fundamental features.In the domain of metaphysics as elsewhere, there is agood deal to be done before a learned journal—howevercarefully recruited and well-chosen its contributors are—canmaintain its otherwise well-deserved reputation. Othersciences and branches of knowledge have their standards.Mathematics has its standard within itself; history andtheology have it in secular or sacred books; natural sci-ence and medicine have it in mathematics and experience;jurisprudence has it in law books; and even matters of tastehave standards in the examples of the ancients. But forjudging the thing called metaphysics the standard has yetto be found (I have made an attempt to settle what it isand how it should be used). Until it is worked out, whatis to be done when works of this kind are to be judged?If the works are of the dogmatic kind, do what you likewith them; when someone plays the master over others·inthis game·, it won’t be long before he runs into someoneelse who pays him back in kind. But if the writings areof the critical sort—offering a critique not of other writingsbut of reason itself—then the standard of judgment can’tbe•taken for granted but must first be•sought for. Whensuch writings are in question, it may still be all right to offerobjections and blame; but underlying them should be anattitude of co-operation, because the need·for standards,and for metaphysics to become a science·is common to usall, and the lack of the needed insight makes it inappropriatefor anyone to come across as a judge handing down verdicts.But so as to connect this defence·of my work·withthe interests of the philosophizing public, I propose atestthat will settle the question of how metaphysical enquiriesshould be directed towards their common end. It is just whatmathematicians have done to show by competition whichmethods are best:I challenge my reviewer critic to provein his wayany one really metaphysical principle that he accepts.Being metaphysical it must be synthetic and knowna priorifrom concepts. It•could be one of the mostindispensable principles, as for instance the principleof the persistence of substance, or of the necessary80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantMaking metaphysics actual as a sciencedetermination of events in the world by their causes;but it•must (this is a fair demand) be proved onapriorigrounds.If he can’t do this (and silence is a confession), he mustadmit thatas metaphysics is nothing at all without the absolutecertainty of propositions of this kind,·and as hecan’t prove any of them in his dogmatic manner·,the first thing that’s needed—before anything else isdone—is to establish the possibility or impossibility ofmetaphysics, in a critique of pure reason.So he is obliged either to admit that my principles of criticismare correct, or to prove that they are not. I can already foreseethat, although he has been carefree in his reliance on thecertainty of his principles, when it comes to a strict test hewon’t find a single one in the whole range of metaphysicsthat he can boldly bring forward. So I shall grant him themost favourable terms that can ever be expected in such acompetition, namely: I shall take the onus of proof from himand lay it on myself.He finds in thesePreliminaries[section 51]and in myCri-tique(B 454–89, the Antinomies chapter) eight propositions,in pairs whose members contradict each other, but eachof which necessarily belongs to metaphysics, which musteither accept or disprove it (although each has in its daybeen accepted by some philosopher). Now the revieweris at liberty to select•any one he likes out of these eightpropositions, and to accept it without any proof (that’s agift from me), but•only one (for wasting time won’t doeither of us any good); and then to attack my proof of thecontrary proposition. If I can rescue the latter, therebyshowing that the opposite of the proposition he chose can bejust as clearly proved in accordance with principles thatevery dogmatic metaphysics must necessarily recognize,then this will settle that metaphysics has a hereditary faultthat can’t beexplained—let aloneremoved—until we ascendto the birth-place of metaphysics, pure reason itself. Somy critique—·which makes that ascent·—must either beaccepted or replaced by a better one; it must at least bestudied, which is all I am demanding now. If on the otherhand I can’t save my proof, then•a synthetic propositionapriorifrom dogmatic principles is firmly entrenched on myopponent’s side,•my impeachment of ordinary metaphysicsis·revealed as·unfair, and•I pledge myself to recognize hiscensure of my critique as justified (though none of thiswillhappen!). But for this it would be necessary, it seems to me,that he shoulddrop his anonymity. Otherwise I don’t seehow I could avoid, instead of having just one problem to dealwith, being honoured or assailed by many problems fromanonymous and indeed uninvited opponents.Proposal for an investigation of theCritique, on whicha judgment can followI am obliged to the learned public for the silence with whichit has for a long time honoured myCritique; for this shows•a postponement of judgment, and thus•some suppositionthat a work that leaves all the beaten paths and strikes outon a new and initially difficult one may contain somethingthrough which an important but currently withered branchof human knowledge might derive new life and fruitfulness;and thus it also shows•a concern not to break off anddestroy the still delicate graft through a hasty judgment.A specimen of a judgment that was delayed for the abovereasons is now before my eyes in theGotha Scholarly News.Setting aside my own (suspect) praise for this review, anyreader can see for himself that it is a solid piece of work; thiscan be seen from its graspable and accurate presentation ofa portion of the basic principles of my work.81"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantMaking metaphysics actual as a scienceBecause an extensive structure can’t be judged as a wholefrom a hurried glance, I propose that it[the system ofCritique ofPure Reason]be tested piece by piece from its foundations,and that the presentPreliminariesbe used as a generaloutline with which the work itself could then sometimesbe compared. If this suggestion were based only on theimagined importance that vanity usually attributes to one’sown output, it would be immodest and would deserve tobe indignantly rejected. But·that isn’t how things stand;something very serious is at stake·; the affairs of speculativephilosophy are now on the brink of total extinction, althoughhuman reason hangs onto them with undying affection,an affection that is now trying (and failing) to change intoindifference because it has been constantly disappointed.In our thinking age one might expect that many deservingmen would use any good opportunity to work together forthe common interest of an ever more enlightened reason, ifonly there were some hope that in this way they would reachtheir goal. Mathematics, natural science, law, arts, evenmorals etc., don’t completely fill the soul; there’s always aspace staked out for pure, speculative reason. The emptinessof this space prompts us to resort to grotesque masks andworthless glitter, or to mysticism, ostensibly in search ofemployment and entertainment though really we are justdistracting ourselves so as to drown out the burdensomevoice of reason, which, true to its own nature, demandssomething that can satisfyit, and not merely somethingthat started up so as to serve other ends or to satisfy ourinclinations. So a study that is concentrated on•this territoryofreason existing for itselfmust (or so I have reason to hope)have a great attraction for anyone who has tried in this way tostretch his thought, because it is just precisely•here that allother kinds of knowledge—all other goals, even—must cometogether and unite into a whole. I would venture to say thatthe attraction is greater than any other theoretical knowledgehas; one wouldn’t lightly trade this one for any of them—e.g.forgoing metaphysics in order to take up chemistry.However, for this investigation I am not offering thework itself, but rather thesePreliminariesas plan and guide.AlthoughI am even now well satisfied with theCritiqueas faras its content, order, and manner of presentationare concerned, and with how carefully I weighed andtested every sentence before writing it down (for it hastaken me years to be completely satisfied not onlyover-all but·also in detail·, sometimes labouring tobecome satisfied with the sources of one particularproposition),I am nevertheless not completely satisfied with my expositionin some chapters of the Doctrine of Elements—for exampleon the Deduction of the Concepts of the Understanding,or on the Paralogisms of Pure Reason—because a certainlong-windedness takes away from their clarity; and yourexamination·of the work as a whole·could be based on whatthesePreliminariessay about those chapters rather than onthe chapters themselves.The Germans are praised for taking things further thanpeople of other nations in matters where steady and contin-uous work is needed. If this opinion is well founded, thenan opportunity to confirm it presents itself here: a project inwhich all thinking men have an equal interest, and whosesuccessful outcome is hardly in doubt, though it has neversucceeded before. The prospects for completing the projectare good especially because the science in question is of sucha peculiar sort that it can be brought to completion all atonce, reaching apermanent statein which it can never be•taken the least bit further,•amplified by later discoveries,or even•altered in any way (apart from improvements in82"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ProlegomenaImmanuel KantMaking metaphysics actual as a scienceclarity in some places, or improvements in how the scienceis used for all sorts of purposes). This advantage·of beingmade finally complete in a single operation·is one that noother science can have, because none of the others concernsa cognitive faculty that is as completely isolated and asindependent of other faculties·as is the faculty of purereason·. The present moment seems to be favourable to myexpectations, because just now in Germany no-one seemsto know how to occupy himself outside the so-called usefulsciences, doing something that isn’t mere play, but a projectin which success will be permanent.I must leave to others to work out how the efforts ofscholars might be united in the pursuit of this goal. I’m notlooking for a mere acceptance of my theses by anyone; I’mnot even flattering myself with thehopeof that. But as longas the matter is investigated from the ground up, perhapswith·my system’s being subjected to·attacks, repetitions,qualifications, or confirmation, completion, and extension,the outcome is certain to be a system—maybe not mine—which can become a possession for which future generationswill have reason to be grateful.It would take too long for me to show here•what kindof metaphysics may be expected to ensue if we first getright about the principles of criticism, and to show•how theresultant metaphysics would appear richly and respectablyoutfitted,notcutting a poor, paltry, plucked figure justbecause its old false feathers had been pulled out! Butother great benefits that such a reform would bring withit are immediately obvious. The ordinary metaphysics hadgood uses, in that it sought out the elementary concepts ofpure understanding in order to clarify them through analysisand make them definite through explanation. In this wayit was a training for reason, in whatever direction it mightgo. But that’s all the good the ordinary metaphysics did;·and really it didlessthan that·. For it negated this service·that it had performed for reason·by encouraging conceitthrough reckless assertions, sophistry through subtle es-capes and excuses, and shallowness through the ease withwhich it settled the most difficult problems by means ofa little school-philosophy. This school-philosophy is allthe more seductive the more it has the option of takingsomething from the language of science (on the one hand)and something from ordinary speech and thought (on theother), thus being all things to all men—but in reality nothingat all! In contrast, criticism gives to our judgment a standardby which knowledge can with certainty be distinguishedfrom pseudo-knowledge; and, by being brought into fulloperation in metaphysics, criticism lays the basis for a wayof thinking that goes on to extend its healthy influence overevery other use of reason, for the first time inspiring thetrue philosophical spirit. But the service that criticism doesfor theology also, by making it independent of the judgmentof dogmatic speculation and thus securing it completelyagainst the attacks of all dogmatic opponents, is certainlynot to be valued lightly. For ordinary metaphysics, althoughit promised to give great help to theology, couldn’t keep thispromise;·indeed it was worse than useless to theology·. Bycalling speculative dogmatics to its assistance,·which itdid under the influence of common metaphysics·, theologysucceeded only in arming enemiesagainstitself. Mysticism,which can prosper in a rationalistic age only when it hidesbehind a system of school-metaphysics, under the protectionof which it may venture torave rationally, so to speak, will bedriven by critical philosophy from this, its last hiding-place.And concerning all of this nothing else can be as importantfor a teacher of metaphysics as to be able to say—once andfor all, with universal agreement—that what he is expound-ing is at lastscience, and that it will bring real benefit to thepublic.83"}]
