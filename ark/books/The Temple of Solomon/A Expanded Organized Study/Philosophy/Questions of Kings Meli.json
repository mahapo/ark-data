It presents Buddhist doctrine in a very attractive andmemorable form as a dialogue between a Bactrian Greekking, Milinda, who plays the ‘Devil’s Advocate’ and aBuddhist sage, Nàgasena. The topics covered include mostof those questions commonly asked by Westerners such as“If there is no soul, what is it that is reborn?” and “If thereis no soul, who is talking to you now?”This abridgement provides a concise presentation ofthis masterpiece of Buddhist literature. The introductionoutlines the historical background against which the dia-logues took place, indicating the meeting of two great cul-tures, that of ancient Greece and the Buddhism of the Indusvalley, which was a legacy of the great Emperor Asoka. It ishoped that the adequate references, glossary, and list ofPali quotations will provide readers with an incentive toread further from the translations of the Pali texts."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Debate ofKing Milindaan Abridgement ofThe Milinda Pa¤haEdited byBhikkhu PesalaPreviously Published byInward PathPenang • Malaysia"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6Bhikkhu Pesala Bhikkhu Pesala is anEnglish monk ordained in1979 by Venerable MahàsãSayàdaw of Burma whilethe Venerable Sayàdawwas on a mission to theUnited Kingdom to teachVipassanà Meditation.Bhikkhu Pesala has visited Burma four times to trainin Mahàsã Sayàdaw’s Vipassanà method.After returning to the UK in 1985 he worked closelywith Venerable Hammalawa Saddhàtissa, helping him toprepare a number of publications including:‘A Buddhist’s Manual’,‘Abhidhammatthàvibhàvinãñãkà’,‘Pali Literature of South-East Asia’and ‘Facets of Buddhism’.In 1995, Bhikkhu Pesala founded the Association forInsight Meditation to promote the Venerable MahàsãSayàdaw’s teaching and meditation method.

Dr. Hammalawa SaddhàtissaThe Milinda Pa¤ha is a Pali book written in about the 1stcentury B.C. King Milinda, a Bactrian king who ruled thenortheast of India, met a learned monk called Nàgasena andthe king put to him a number of questions on thephilosophy, psychology, and ethics of Buddhism. I presumethis debate was conducted in the Bactrian Greek language,but was later translated into Pali and Sanskrit.This well-known Pali book, called Milinda Pa¤ha orQuestions of King Milinda, has twice been translated intoEnglish: in 1890, and in 1969. Both translations are literaryand, in many places, literal; therefore they were mainlyconfined to scholars. This present work is, however, not aliteral but a free rendering, making an abridgement andaimed at the reader who prefers to take a short cut ratherthan the long way, notwithstanding that the latter may bevery beautiful.The framework remains the same as the original, butin many cases the number of similes used to make a pointhas been reduced.The author, Bhikkhu Pesala, is a Buddhist monk whohas had training in Burma and Thailand and whose know-ledge of Pali has enabled him to check areas of ambiguoustranslation to compile this concise and readable work inelegant, modern English, while his knowledge of Bud-dhism has enabled him to clarify some obscure ideas.This book will certainly serve its intended aim by itsuncomplicated presentation of the original work."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9Editor’s PrefaceI started work on the first edition of “The Debate of KingMilinda” in 1988 at the instigation of Ven. Dr. HammalawaSaddhàtissa. A Sri Lankan supporter, Indrajit Samaranayake,gave me the keys to his house, and I typed the first draft onhis computer while he and his wife were at work. In 1990 Ibrought out the first paperback edition of 500 copies for freedistribution.Motilal Banarsidass reprinted this first edition as ahardback in 1991, and in 1998 they printed a revised edition.My original intention in abridging Rhys David’s translationwas to make this important work of Buddhist literatureaccessible to as many people as possible, but it is still notwidely available. Therefore, I produced a pocket edition,published by the Association for Insight Meditation.The Milinda Pa¤ha is ideally suited for people edu-cated in the West. Most questions that sceptical Westernersask me are answered in its pages. The method of reasonedinquiry is the one advised by the Buddha himself in theDiscourse to the Kàlàmas. However, one should keep anopen mind. Ignorance of the Dhamma is the main reasonthat we have taken rebirth. The truth is concealed from un-enlightened minds: to gain insight and right understandingwe need to practise insight meditation, which is the onlyway to win liberation from the cycle of suffering.Bhikkhu PesalaApril, 2001"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10ContentsOverview ................................................................................................................................................ 3Foreword ............................................................................................................................................... 8Editor’s Preface ............................................................................................................................ 9Dedication .......................................................................................................................................... 15Abbreviations .................................................................................................................................. 16Introduction .................................................................................................................................... 17The Rise of the Magadha Kingdom ...................................................................... 21The Rise of the Bactrian Kingdom ........................................................................ 23Comparison with the Chinese Text ....................................................................... 25The Arrangement of the Pali Book ..................................................................... 27Prologue ............................................................................................................................................... 29Chapter 1The Soul ............................................................................................................... 32Chapter 2Rebirth ................................................................................................................... 43Chapter 3The Beginning of Time ........................................................................ 48Chapter 4Sense Bases ........................................................................................................ 55Chapter 5The Buddha ...................................................................................................... 58Chapter 6Attachment ..................................................................................................... 62Chapter 7Memory .................................................................................................................. 66"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11Chapter 8The Solving of Dilemmas (I) ....................................................... 731.

In the Pali book itsays that the conversations between King Milinda andNàgasena took place five hundred years after the Pari-nibbàna of the Buddha. Mr. T.W. Rhys Davids, the most abletranslator of the Pali texts, regarded the Milinda Pa¤ha veryhighly. He said, “I venture to think that the ‘Questions ofKing Milinda’ is undoubtedly the masterpiece of Indianprose; and indeed the best book of its class, from a literarypoint of view, that had been produced in any country.”11.T.W. Rhys Davids, QKM Introduction."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18The style of the Milinda Pa¤ha is very much like aPlatonic dialogue, Nàgasena playing the part of Socratesand winning over King Milinda to the Buddhist viewpointby his sound reasoning and his fitting similes. The authoris not known but it is almost certain that he lived in the farnorthwest of India or in the Punjab, since he mentions noplace in the interior of India south of the Ganges.2 This issupported by what is definitely known about KingMenander, a Bactrian king identified with Milinda.Much more is known about King Menander. Many ofhis coins have been found over a wide area of northernIndia, as far west as Kabul, as far east as Mathura and as farnorth as Kashmir. The portrait is sometimes of a youngman and other times that of a very old man. Plutarch says,“Menander was a king noted for justice who enjoyed suchpopularity with his subjects that upon his death, whichtook place in camp, diverse cities contended for the posses-sion of his ashes. The dispute was settled by the represent-atives of the different cities agreeing to divide the relics,and then erecting separate monuments to his memory”.The recent publication of the Mir Zakah treasureconfirms the rule of Menander in Ghazni and adjoiningareas of the Kabul valley in the north (there are 521 coins ofMenander in that treasure). The discovery of an AtticTetradrachm of Menander sets speculation at rest; he musthave ruled over the Kabul region. In the north he occupiedHazara and the Swat valley.3 So Menander was one of the2.A.K. Narain, The Indo-Greeks.3.A.K.

Heprobably reigned from about 150 to 110 B.C. (thus datinghis conversations not much more than 400 years after theParinibbàna of the Buddha). Strabo draws attention inpassing to the remarkable way in which the kingdom ofBactria expanded beyond its original limits, and hementions incidentally that the kings chiefly responsiblewere Demetrius and Menander.... But Menander left a fardeeper mark on the tradition of India than did Demetrius.4Menander annexed the Indus delta, the peninsula ofSurastra (Kathiavar), occupied Mathura on the Jumna,besieged Madyamika (Nagari near Chitor) and Saketam insouthern Oudh, and threatened the capital, Pàñaliputta. Butthe invasion was repulsed and Menander was forced toreturn to his own country.5 Since the Bactrians later becameBuddhists there can be little doubt that King Menander isindeed the King Milinda referred to in the book. However,the conversations may be just a literary device the authorused to add interest. His primary aim is to clarify Buddhistdoctrine and to refute the wrong views promulgated byvarious opponents of Buddhism.The introductory story in the Milinda Pa¤ha concern-ing Nàgasena’s upbringing is almost identical to the storyof the young Moggaliputta Tissa, which is told in the Mahà-vaüsa, the Ceylon Chronicles.

However, the Mahàvaüsawas written much later by Mahànàma, at the beginning ofthe 6th century A.D., so the story could have been bor-rowed by Mahànàma from the Milinda Pa¤ha, which was bythen a venerable book edited by Buddhaghosa. (In theMilinda òika, a commentary on the Milinda Pa¤ha, it is statedthat several verses of prologue and epilogue in the MilindaPa¤ha were composed by Buddhaghosa).From the supposed conversation that Milinda haswith Påraõa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala and other ascetics6it is obvious that this introductory story was fabricated bythe author since these ascetics were contemporaries of theBuddha. The story is based on the Sàma¤¤a Phala Sutta ofthe Dãgha Nikàya. One point of difference is noteworthy: inthe Sàma¤¤a Phala Sutta,7 Prince Ajàtasattu goes to see theBuddha but is unable to recognise him; whereas in theintroduction to the Milinda Pa¤ha, King Milinda says ofNàgasena, “There is no need to point him out to me”, thusshowing his great superiority to Prince Ajàtasattu.6.Though this supposed conversation is found in the original text, it adds nothing of substance to the dialogues, and could not have taken place, so I have left it out.7.D. i. 50Bactrian coin depictingKing Milinda (Menander)150 to 110 B.C.(National Museum, New Delhi)"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21The Rise of the Magadha KingdomIn the Mahàparinibbàna Sutta the Buddha predicted that thecity of Pàñaliputta, which was founded shortly before hisdeath, would become a great city, “ânanda, among thetowns and cities that are centres of congregation and com-merce of people of the Aryan race, this new town will be-come the greatest city, called Pàñaliputta, a place where goodsare unpacked, sold and distributed, but it will be in dangerfrom flood, fire and internal dissension”.8 The MagadhaKingdom, of which Pàñaliputta (modern Patna) was the capi-tal, gradually became the most powerful in all India.In the mid 4th century B.C. a Sudra named Mahà-padma Nanda usurped the throne of the kingdom ofMagadha and became the ruler of a kingdom stretchingfrom the Brahmaputra river in the east to the Beas in thewest. But beyond the Beas were several small kingdoms.During this period, Alexander the Great conqueredPersia and crossed the Hindu Kush into Bactria (NorthernAfghanistan). It took him two years to subdue these inhos-pitable regions, but in so doing he founded several citiespenetrating as far north as Samarkand and Leninabad (inthe USSR). Another city has been identified at Charikar(north of Kabul). Hearing about the river Indus he re-crossed the Hindu Kush in 327 B.C. and pushed eastwardsto Taxila (Takkasãla), but when he reached the Jhelum riverhe encountered the Paurava rajah, who had war elephants.Even the veterans of Macadonia were unable to continue8.D. ii. 87, 88."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22against such opposition, so Alexander was forced to retreatdown the Indus river and thence back through Persia,where he died at Babylon in 323 B.C. Nevertheless, he hadleft behind him the foundations of the Bactrian kingdomand had surveyed the Jhelum and Indus rivers.After Alexander’s death, Chandragupta, the founderof the Mauryan dynasty, was able to drive away the Greekgarrisons from the Indus valley. In 321 B.C. he defeatedNanda and became the ruler of the Magadha kingdomfrom the capital at Pàñaliputta. Alexander’s successor,Seleukos I Nikator, led an expedition against the Indians in311 B.C. hoping to regain the Punjab. However, he was upagainst the might of Chandragupta. So, by 304 B.C.,Seleukos was glad to conclude a treaty with him, giving hisdaughter in marriage and ceding large areas of what is nowBaluchistan and Afghanistan in exchange for 500 warelephants. Seleukos sent his ambassador, Magasthenes, toPàñaliputta and from what remains of his writings weknow something about the size of the army and thestrength of the fortifications there. Chandragupta ruled for24 years and his son Bindusàra, about whom we know verylittle, ruled for 28 years until his death in 269 B.C.At the time of Bindusàra’s death his eldest son was theviceroy at Takkasãla and his younger son, Asoka, was theviceroy at Ujjeni in the south. Asoka fought with his brotherfor the right to ascend to the throne, and when hisbrother was killed in battle, Asoka became the ruler of a vastempire from Bengal to Afghanistan. However, he was stillnot satisfied and it was only in the ninth year of his reign,after the bloody conquest of the Kaliïga kingdom (Orissa)"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23that he gave up warfare and became a devoted follower ofBuddhism. Emperor Asoka sent missions of monks to theborder areas of his great empire. Asokan inscriptions havebeen found in the Kabul valley written in Greek and Ara-maic, and elsewhere his inscriptions say that he had madeDhamma conquests in Egypt, Syria, Macedonia, Greece,Cyprus, Bactria, Kashmir, Gandhàra, etc. The Mahàvaüsasays that missionaries were sent to Kashmir, Gandhàra,Bactria, the Himalayas, Sindh (Gujarat), and inscriptions onrelic caskets found in ståpas at Sanchi record the success ofthose missions to the Himalayas. Unfortunately, the otherståpa records have been vandalised, but we can be sure thatthe missions to Kashmir and Gandhàra were successfulsince even in the Buddha’s time Takkasãla was a renownedcentre of learning. The Mahàvaüsa also records that at theconsecration of the Great Ståpa in 157 B.C. monks camefrom Alasanda (Charika) in Yona (Bactria).The Rise of the Bactrian KingdomAfter the death of Asoka in 227 B.C. the Mauryan empirebegan to disintegrate. The empire founded by Seleukos hadalready revolted in 250 B.C. under its governor, Diodotus Iand it continued to grow under his successors, Diodotus IIand Euthydemus. At the beginning of the 2nd century B.C.the Greek rulers of the new kingdom of Bactria crossed theHindu Kush and began to invade India from the northwest.Of the Greek kings who ruled to the south of the Kush,Apollodotus would seem to be the first. He is twice men-tioned in association with Menander. Their rule extended"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24on the south west to Ariana (southern Afghanistan) and inthe south to the Indus valley.As mentioned above, Menander must have ruledover the Kabul and Swat valleys and at some time heannexed the Indus valley too. Sàgala, the city mentioned inthe Milinda Pa¤ha as the place where the dialogues tookplace, was the ancient city of the Madras who came to theregion in about the 6th century B.C. It is now Sialkot,between the Chenab and Ravi rivers, near the border ofKashmir. At Miln. page 83 (see Question 5, Chapter Seven)it is mentioned that Kashmir is 12 yojanas (84 miles) distantand that Milinda’s birthplace on the island of Alasanda is200 yojanas away. There are many cities founded byAlexander during his conquests, several of which mighthave been the birthplace of Menander. The city founded atCharikar has been suggested by A.K. Narain, but it is ratherless than 200 yojanas (1,400 miles) at the usual reckoning.Could it perhaps be the Alexandra located at Leninabad orone of the Alexandras further West?However, from the available evidence we can postu-late that Menander was born in Bactria, but brought up inAriana (the Kabul valley) and in the early years of his ruleexpanded his father’s kingdom to the Indus valley andbeyond, perhaps later establishing his capital at Sàgala.Unlike Bactria, which was predominantly influenced byGreek culture, these new areas were already Buddhist.Menander, then, would have been educated in the Greektraditions but would have had direct contact with Bud-dhism and no doubt often met monks living in his king-dom. Nevertheless, it does seem rather improbable that his"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25knowledge of doctrine would have been sufficient toengage in the dialogues as recorded in the Milinda Pa¤hasince Milinda is shown to have a substantial knowledge ofthe texts. My opinion is that the author had at most a briefacquaintance with Menander, most probably basing hiswork on an oral tradition of the dialogues and using hisown deep knowledge of the texts to extend the dialoguesinto the longer work that we have now. He might haveused the dialogues as a device to add interest to his treatiseand to please the Greek king by making him one of the cen-tral characters.This hypothesis gains some support from theexistence of Chinese translations that consist of only thefirst three divisions. They are almost identical with the Palias to the questions asked but differ in the introductorystory, which in neither case looks very authentic.Comparison with the Chinese TextAs V. Trenchner pointed out when he transliterated the Palitext in the 1860’s, we can be sure that the original MilindaPa¤ha was in Sanskrit because it begins with the words“Taü yathà nusuyatà” (thus has it been handed down)rather than the Pali formula “Evaü me sutaü” (thus have Iheard). This is confirmed by the presence of Chinesetranslations of the text which, although they obviouslycome from the same root source, show a number of notabledifferences.99.For a detailed and thorough comparison, see Milinda Pa¤ha and Nàgasenabhikshusåtra (A Comparative Study) Bhikkhu Thich Mihn Chau."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"261.The Chinese versions correspond to the first threedivisions of the Pali version, suggesting that the otherfour divisions (Dilemmas, A Question solved byInference, Ascetic Practices, and the Similes) werelater accretions.2.The Chinese work, the Nàgasena-bhikshusåtra takes thename of the monk.

However, we should becautious when drawing conclusions as to which is the moreauthentic. Bhikkhu Thich Mihn Chau, in his efforts to provethe greater antiquity of the original on which the Chinese"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27translation is based, dates it soon after the demise of theBuddha citing the absence of classification of the texts intoVinaya, Sutta, Abhidhamma, and Nikàyas, which were onlywell defined at the Third Council. Yet, Menander was noteven born until 100 years after this council. Clearly, the‘original’ is not earlier than the 1st century B.C. and thelong gap before the translations appeared, in about400 A.D., was ample time for numerous accretions andamendments, or omissions and lacunas to occur.For the reasons already stated above and because theconversations in the Milinda Pa¤ha were said to have takenplace about 500 years after the Buddha’s death, whereasMenander lived at least a hundred years earlier than that, itseems most likely that the Milinda Pa¤ha was composedsome time after Menander’s death, perhaps being based onan oral tradition of actual conversations that did take placebetween Menander and a monk or several monks.Menander’s successors, Queen Agathocleia andStrato I Soter, continued to reign for at least 40 years afterhis death, but their lives saw the emergence of a newdynasty in western India, that of the Sakas (Scythians) andYueh-Chih from central Asia, and the Greek Bactrian eracame to an end.The Arrangement of the Pali BookThe epilogue says that the book is divided into 6 divisionsand 22 chapters containing 262 questions, 42 of which havenot been handed down making 304 in all, but it is difficultto see how this is reckoned. There are numerous discrepan-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28cies between the different texts available, which is to be ex-pected in such an old work. Now only 237 questionsremain.To make cross-reference easier I have followed thesame sequence as the Pali text in numbering the questionsand chapters, except that I have condensed the last sevenchapters into chapter eighteen.In this edition of the Milinda Pa¤ha, although I havefollowed the arrangement of the Pali text, I have left outlarge numbers of similes and condensed long, though oftenvery eloquent passages, (without, I hope, spoiling thebeauty of the original work) in order to make the book rea-sonably concise and thus make it more appealing to thebusy western reader. It is an abridgement, not a translation,therefore here and there I have combined separate para-graphs into one for the sake of brevity, but I have endeav-oured to be faithful to the intention of the original author,which was the clarification of the Buddha’s teaching andthe elucidation of some common misconceptions that onemay fall into.The references in the footnotes are to page numbers ofthe Pali texts of the Pali Text Society. In the correspondingtranslations these page numbers are given in square brack-ets at the top of each left-hand page or, in the case of Vinayaand Jàtaka books, in the body of the text.To help those who would like to know the Pali wordfrom which its translation derives (which is sometimesdifferent to that used by Rhys Davids or Miss Horner) Ihave included Pali words in the index alongside theEnglish reference."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29The Debate of King MilindaPrologueMilinda was the king in the city of Sàgala. He was learnedin the arts and sciences and was of an inquiring disposition.He was skilled in debating and no one could resolve hisdoubts about religious matters. Though he questioned allthe famous teachers none could satisfy him.Assagutta, one of a large number of arahants living inthe Himalayas, knew of the king’s doubts by means ofsupernormal power. So he convened an assembly to ask ifthere was anyone who could answer the king. There was noone, so the whole assembly ascended to the heaven of thethirty-three and requested the god Mahàsena to take birthas a man in order to protect the religion. One of the monks,Rohaõa, agreed to go to Kajangalà where Mahà-sena hadbeen reborn and wait for him to grow up. The boy’s father,Brahman Sonuttara, had the boy educated in the threeVedas but the boy, Nàgasena, declared:“Empty are these three Vedas and as chaff.There is in them neither reality,worth nor essential truth.”Realising that the boy was ready, Rohaõa appeared and theparents consented to their son becoming a novice. So,Nàgasena studied the Abhidhamma. After gaining perfectknowledge of the seven books of the Abhidhamma, Nàga-sena was admitted to the Order of monks and Rohaõa senthim to Vattaniya Hermitage to study with Assagutta. While"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30spending the rainy season there, Nàgasena was asked topreach a sermon to the pious lady who was Assagutta’ssupporter. As a result of the discourse both the lady andNàgasena attained the Eye of the Dhamma, the knowledgethat whatsoever has a beginning also has the inherent qual-ity of passing away. Assagutta then sent Nàgasena toDhammarakkhita at the Asoka Park in Pàñaliputta where,within the space of three months, he mastered the remain-der of the Tipiñaka. Dhammarakkhita admonished his pupilnot to be content with mere book knowledge and the verysame night the diligent pupil Nàgasena gained arahantship.He then went to join the other arahants who were still stay-ing in the Himalayas. Having completed his educationNàgasena was ready to meet anyone in debate.Meanwhile, King Milinda continued his spiritualquest by visiting the bhikkhu âyupàla at the SaükheyyaHermitage and asked him why the monks renounced theworld. The elder replied, “It is for the sake of being able tolive in righteousness and in spiritual calm.” Then the kingasked, “Is there, venerable sir, any layman who lives so?”The elder admitted that there were many such laymen, andthe king retorted:“Then most venerable âyupàla, your going forth is ofno use. It must be in consequence of sins committed insome former birth that recluses renounce the world andeven subject themselves to the added constraints of one orother of the ascetic practices such as wearing only rag-robes, eating only one meal a day, or not lying down tosleep.

There is no one whois capable of debating with me and dispelling my doubts!”However, the Bactrian Greeks were unmoved so theking asked, “Is there then, my good men, any other learnedsage who is able to discuss things with me and dispel mydoubts?”Then the minister Devamantiya said, “There is, GreatKing, an elder named Nàgasena who is learned, of subduedmanners yet full of courage; he is capable of discussingwith you.

Therefore any service rendered to himbecomes empty and vain.’ Tear apart this tangle of wrong-views, solve this dilemma and give insight to the futuresons of the Buddha with which to refute their adversaries.”“The Blessed One, O king, is entirely set free and hasno attachment to either gifts or honour paid to him.”“Nàgasena, a son may speak in praise of his father, ora father in praise of his son but that is not sufficient groundsto silence the critics.”57.cf. A. iii. 206. One of five qualities which lead to one being an outcaste. He is not one who believes in the performance of rituals, or in omens; but he believes in deeds, so he celebrates festivals by observing the eight precepts, listening to the Dhamma and practising meditation."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76“Even though the Blessed One has now passed awayand cannot be said to accept gifts and honours paid to himyet deeds done in his name are of value and bear great fruit.As a great and mighty wind that blew, even so the BlessedOne has blown over the world with his love, so soothing, sogentle and so pure. Like men tormented by heat and feverare soothed by a cool wind, so, too, beings tormented by theheat of desire, hatred and delusion are pacified by the sub-lime teaching of the Blessed One. Although, great king, theBlessed One has entirely passed away, he has left behindhis doctrine, his discipline and his precious relics whosevalue derives from his virtue, concentration, wisdom andfreedom. Beings afflicted by the sorrows of becoming canstill receive the benefits of these things, as those who havefans can still make a breeze although the wind has subsid-ed. This was foreseen by the Blessed One when he said, ‘Itmay be, ânanda, that some of you may think, “The word ofthe master is ended; we have no teacher any more”, but youshould not regard it so. The Dhamma that has beenpreached by me and the rules that I have laid down, letthem be your teachers when I am gone’.58“Hear another reason, O king.

You have disclosed that which was hidden,undone the knot, cleared the thicket, refuted the false viewand the sectarians have been shrouded in darkness by you,the best of all the leaders of schools.”2. The Omniscience of the Buddha“Nàgasena, was the Buddha omniscient?”“Yes, O king, but the insight of knowledge was not59.DhA. iii. 178, Commentary on Dhp. v 176.

It depended on reflection.”“Then, Nàgasena, the Buddha could not have beenomniscient if his knowledge was reached through re-flection.”“I will explain further. There are seven classes of men-tal ability. Firstly, there are ordinary people (puthujjana)who are full of desire, hatred and delusion; untrained intheir action, speech and thought; their thinking acts slowlyand with difficulty.“Secondly, there are stream-winners who haveattained to right view and rightly grasped the Master’steaching. Their thinking powers are quick and functioneasily as far as the first three fetters are concerned butbeyond that they function slowly and with difficulty.“Thirdly, there are once-returners in whom desireand hatred are reduced. Their thinking powers workquickly and easily as far as the five lower fetters areconcerned but slowly and with difficulty beyond that.“Fourthly, there are non-returners in whom desireand hatred are eliminated. Their thinking powers workquickly and easily as far as the ten fetters but slowly andwith difficulty beyond that.“Fifthly, there are the arahants in whom the floods ofsensual desire, desire for rebirth, personality-belief andignorance have ceased, who have lived the holy life andreached their final goal. Their thinking powers workquickly as far as the range of a disciple is concerned butslowly and with difficulty beyond that.6464.There is no lack in their wisdom, but as regards knowledge of former lives or knowledge of the spiritual faculties of beings there is."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79“Sixthly, there are Solitary Buddhas who are depend-ent on themselves alone, needing no teacher. Their thinkingpowers work quickly as far as their own range is concernedbut as regards that which is exclusively the range of thePerfectly Enlightened Ones their thinking works slowlyand with difficulty. Like a man who would readily cross asmall river that was on his own property but would hesi-tate to cross the great ocean.“Lastly, there are Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas whohave all knowledge, are endowed with the ten powers, thefour modes of fearlessness, and the eighteen characteristicsof a Buddha. Their thinking powers are quickly exercisedwithout sluggishness in any area of knowledge. As a sharpbolt on a powerful crossbow would easily pass through athin cloth, just so their knowledge is unimpeded and easilyoutclasses the other six. It is because their minds are so clearand agile that the Buddhas can display the Twin Miracle.65From that we may only guess how clear and active theirpowers are. For all these wonders there is no reason otherthan reflection that can be asserted.”“Nevertheless, Nàgasena, reflection is carried out forthe purpose of seeking out what was not already clearbefore the reflection began.”“A rich man would not be called poor just becausethere was no food prepared when a traveller arrived at hishouse unexpectedly; nor would a tree be called barrenwhen it was fully laden just because no fruit had yet fallen65.A feat of supernormal power where fountains of fire and water issue simultaneously from each pore of his body."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80on the ground. So too the Buddha is indeed omniscientalthough his knowledge is gained through reflection.”3. Devadatta’s Ordination“If the Buddha was both omniscient and full of compassionwhy did he admit Devadatta to the Order, since by causinga schism66 [which only a bhikkhu can do] he was therebyconsigned to hell for an aeon?67 If the Buddha did not knowwhat Devadatta would do then he was not omniscient andif he knew then he was not compassionate.”“The Blessed One was both omniscient and full ofcompassion. It was because he foresaw that Devadatta’ssuffering would become limited that he admitted him tothe Order. As a man of influence might have a criminal’ssentence mitigated from execution to the cutting off ofhands and feet but would not thereby be responsible for thepain and suffering that that man had to undergo, or as aclever physician would make a critical disease lighter bygiving a powerful purgative, so did the Buddha reduce thefuture suffering of Devadatta by admitting him to theOrder. After he has suffered for the rest of the aeon inpurgatory Devadatta will be released and become aSolitary Buddha by the name of Aññhissara.”“Great is the gift bestowed, Nàgasena, by the BlessedOne on Devadatta. The Tathàgata pointed out the road tohim when he was lost in the jungle, he gave him a firm66.Schism occurs when two groups of four or more monks living within the same boundary recite the Pàtimokkha separately.67.Kappa, or Kalpa, see footnote to Dilemma 10."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81foothold when he was falling down a precipice.

Causes of Earthquakes“The Buddha said, Nàgasena, that there are eight causes ofa great earthquake.68 Yet we find that there is a ninth causealso mentioned in the texts. When the Bodhisatta Ves-santara fulfilled the perfection of generosity by givingaway his wife and children as servants then, too, did thegreat earth shake. If the former statement of the Buddha istrue then the latter is false.”“Both statements, O king, are correct. The gift of Ves-santara was not mentioned as a ninth cause of a great earth-quake because it is an extremely rare occurrence. Just as thedried up creek that does not usually hold water is not calleda river, but in times of exceptional rainfall it becomes ariver, so too the largesse of Vessantara was an isolated andextraordinary occurrence, and for that reason one distinctfrom the eight usual causes of a great earthquake.“Have you ever heard, O king, in the history of ourreligion of any act of devotion that gave its result in thisvery life?”“Yes, venerable Nàgasena, there are seven such cases:Sumana the garland maker,69 Ekasàñaka the brahman,7068.D. ii. 107; A iv. 312.69.DhA. ii. 40f, Dhp. v 68.70.DhA. iii. 1, Dhp. v 116."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82Puõõa the farm worker,71 Mallikà the queen,72 the queenknown as the mother of Gopàla,73 Suppiyà the devotedwoman74 and Puõõà the slave-girl.”75“But have you ever heard, O king, of the earth shak-ing even once or twice when a gift had been given?”“No, venerable sir, I have never heard of that.”“I too, O king, have never heard of such a thing,though I have been devoted to study and ready to learn,except for this case of the splendid gift of Vessantara. It isby no common effort, O king, that the great earth is moved.It is when overburdened by the weight of righteousness,overpowered by the burden of the goodness of acts thattestify to absolute purity; that, unable to support it, thebroad earth quakes and trembles. When Vessantara gavehis gift, O king, he was giving things away not for the sakeof a glorious rebirth, nor for future wealth, nor to receivegifts in return, nor for flattery, nor for any other personalgain, but only for the sake of supreme wisdom.”5. Asseveration of Truth“King Sãvi gave his eyes to someone who begged for themand new eyes arose in their place.76 How is this possible?”71.DhA. iii. 302f, Dhp. v 223.72.Jà. iii. 405, Dhp. v 177.73.AA. i. 207f.74.Vin. i. 217-8.

Aswhen mystics recite the truth they can make the rain fall,drive back fire or neutralize poison.“When Asoka the righteous ruler stood one day amongthe townsfolk of Pàñaliputta he said to his ministers; ‘Is thereanyone who could make this great Ganges flow backwardsand upstream?’ Then a certain courtesan, named Bindumatã,was in the crowd and she performed an act of truth. At thatvery moment the mighty Ganges, roaring and raging, rolledback upstream in sight of everyone. The king, awestruck,sought out the woman who was the cause of this and askedher, ‘What is the act of truth by which you did this?’ She re-plied, ‘Whoever pays me, whether he is a brahmin, a noble, atradesman or a servant, I regard them all alike. Free from biasI do service to him who has paid me. This is the basis of theact of truth77 by which I turned the Ganges back.’“There is no ordinary cause for those things tohappen but the power of truth is itself the cause.

The Duration of the Religion“After the ordination of women, the Blessed One said thatthe pure doctrine would only last for five hundred years.81However, to Subaddha he said, ‘So long as the brethren livethe perfect holy life then this world will not be bereft ofarahants.’ These statements are contradictory.”“O king, the Blessed One did make both statements,but they are different in the spirit and in the letter. Onedeals with the duration of the pure doctrine whereas theother deals with the practice of the religious life, two thingswidely distinct.

When the intellectual grasp ceases then even theman who conducts himself rightly has no clear understand-ing of it. By the decline of practice, promulgation of theVinaya rules ceases and only the outward form of the reli-gion remains. When the outward form ceases then the suc-cession of the tradition is cut off.”8. Purity of the Buddha“If the Tathàgata destroyed all unwholesomeness in him-self when he gained omniscience why did he get hurt by asplinter of rock that was thrown by Devadatta? If he didget hurt then he cannot have been free from all evil, forthere is no feeling without kamma. All feeling has its rootin kamma and it is only on account of kamma that feelingarises.”“No, great king, not all feeling has its root in kamma.There are eight causes of the arising of feelings. Excess ofwind, of bile and of phlegm, the mixture of the three bodilyfluids, variations in temperature, stress of circumstances,83.Sãla, samàdhi, pa¤¤à (Virtue, concentration and wisdom)."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86external agency and kamma. Whoever says, ‘It is only kam-ma that oppresses beings’, thereby excludes the other sevenreasons and that statement of theirs is wrong.“When one’s wind is disturbed it happens in one often ways; by cold, by heat, by hunger, by thirst, by over-eating, by standing too long, by over exertion, by running,by medical treatment, or as a result of kamma. When the bileis disturbed it is in one of three ways; by cold, by heat or byunsuitable food. When the phlegm is disturbed it is in oneof three ways; by cold, by heat or by eating and drinking.When these three disturbed fluids are mixed it brings aboutits own distinctive pain. Then there are pains arising fromvariations in temperature, stress of circumstances and byexternal agencies. There is also that pain which has kammaas its cause. So the pain that is due to kamma is much lessthan that due to other causes. The ignorant go too far whenthey say that everything that is experienced is produced asthe fruit of kamma. Without a Buddha’s insight no one canascertain the extent of the action of kamma.When the Blessed One’s foot was grazed by the splin-ter of rock the pain was produced only by external agency.Although the Blessed One never suffered pain that was theresult of his own kamma, or brought about by the stress ofcircumstances, he suffered pain from each of the other sixcauses.84It was said, O king, by the Blessed One, ‘There are cer-tain pains, Sãvaka, which arise from bilious humours andyou ought to know what they are for, it is a matter of com-84.This is a controversial point.

Perfection of the Buddha“If the Tathàgata had accomplished everything under thebodhi tree why did he spend a further three months insolitude?86 If a man has eaten and is satisfied, what is theuse of further food; if a man is healthy, what is the use ofhim taking medicine?”“O king, solitary meditation has many benefits. Allthe Tathàgatas attained to Buddhahood thereby and prac-tised it in appreciation of its benefits to mankind. There aretwenty-eight benefits of solitude: it guards him, increaseshis life expectancy, gives him vigour, conceals his failings,removes any bad reputation and brings fame, destroys dis-content and brings satisfaction, banishes fear and endowshim with confidence, removes sloth and fills him with zeal,takes away desire, hatred and delusion, subdues pride, dis-rupts discursive thought and makes the mind one-pointed,softens his mind and makes him light-hearted, makes himserious, brings him material gain, makes him worthy ofreverence, brings him joy, fills him with delight, shows himthe true nature of all formations, puts an end to rebirth, andgains for him all the fruits of a life of renunciation.

It is notbecause they have anything left to achieve or anything toadd to what they have already accomplished but onlybecause of these excellent advantages that they practiceseclusion.”10. Equanimity of the Buddha“The Buddha said that, if he wished, he could live for theremainder of the world-cycle87 but he also said that hewould die at the end of three months.88 How can both ofthese statements be true?”“Aeon, O king, in that connection means a man’s life-span and what the Buddha said was in order to exalt thebases of success (iddhipàda). The Blessed One was entirelyfree from desire for any kind of future life and condemnedthem all for he said, ‘I find no beauty in the smallest part offuture life, just as even a small quantity of excrement is ofbad smell’.”8987.D. ii. 103. — A world-cycle (kappa) usually refers to a period of evolution and dissolution of the world but here it means a man’s average life-span; about 100 years at the time of the Buddha, now only 75 years.

The Power of Màra“Although you say that the Tathàgata was in constantreceipt of alms100 yet when he entered the Pa¤casàla100.cf.

Just asa mighty rain cloud, O king, pours out its rain, and givessustenance to grass and trees, to cattle and to men, and allliving things depend on it, but the cloud has no feelings oflonging with the idea that ‘These are mine’ — so too, theTathàgata instructs all beings in good qualities and main-tains them in goodness, and all beings depend on him buthe has no concept of possession because he has abandonedall wrong views of self.”18. The Unity of the Order“You say that the Order of the Tathàgata could never bebroken up.107 Yet Devadatta was able to lead away fivehundred monks from the Blessed One”.108“It was due to the power of the schismatic that theschism occurred, for even a mother can be disunited fromher son where there is one to make a rift. However, it wassaid in a special sense that the Order of the Tathàgata couldnot be broken up. It is an unheard of thing that his follow-ing could be disunited by anything done or any unkindword, wrong action, or injustice whatsoever of the Tathà-gata himself.

In the practice and develop-ment of all these things a recluse lives. By undertaking thistraining and developing the virtues of a recluse he is pro-gressing towards arahantship. Thus, because he sees him asin the company of the most worthy ones, the devout lay-man thinks it right and proper to revere the recluse thoughhe may be just an ordinary person. Moreover, O king, be-cause he sees him as one who is maintaining the monastictraditions, so too does the devout layman pay respect tothe recluse. If a layman attains arahant-ship, only two des-tinations await him; either he must enter the Order thatvery day or else he must attain parinibbàna. Immovable, Oking, is the state of renunciation, glorious and most exalt-ed the condition of being a member of the Order of theBlessed One.”20. The Compassion of the Buddha“You say that the Tathàgata protects beings from harm andblesses them with goodness,111 yet when the Blessed Onewas preaching the discourse on the simile of the great massof fire112 to the monks, hot blood was ejected from themouths of sixty monks. By his delivery of that discoursethey came to harm and not good so that statement of yoursis wrong.”“What happened to them was of their own doing.”“But, Nàgasena, if the Tathàgata had not delivered111.Untraced but cf. A. i. 20.112.A. iv. 128-135."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"99that discourse would they have vomited hot blood?”“No. When they took wrongly what was said theburning was kindled within them.”“Then it must have been that the Tathàgata was thechief cause to destroy them. If a snake were to crawl into ananthill, and a man in want of earth were to break into it andtake the earth away, and so the snake was to die for want ofair, would not the snake have been killed by that man’saction?”“Yes, O king. Nevertheless, when the Tathàgata de-livered a discourse he never did so with malice butpreached totally free from malice. Those who were practis-ing rightly were enlightened, but those were practisingwrongly, fell. Just, O king, as when a man shakes a mangotree, those fruits that are strongly fastened to it remain un-disturbed but those that have rotten stalks fall to theground.”“Then did not those monks fall because of the dis-course?”“Could a carpenter by doing nothing to a piece oftimber and simply laying it aside, make it straight and fitfor use?”“No venerable sir.”“Just so, O king, the Tathàgata could not, by merelywatching over his disciples, have opened the eyes of thosewho were ready to see. However, by getting rid of thosewho took his words wrongly he saved those who wereprepared to be saved, and it was because of their owndefects that the evil-minded, fell.”"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"10021. The modesty of the Buddha“This too was said by the Blessed One:“Control of the body is good,Good is control of speech,Control of the mind is good,Good is control is everything.”113“Yet when the Tathàgata was seated in the midst of the fourcongregations [monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen] heshowed to Brahman Sela what should not be shown inpublic — the male organ concealed in a sheath.114 If he didso then the first statement is false.”“The Blessed One did show to Sela the Brahman whatshould not be shown in public but it was by means ofsupernormal power that he created an image of it and onlySela saw that image. To him, in whom doubts had arisenabout the Tathàgata, the Master showed the male organconcealed in a sheath by means of supernormal power forthe sake of awakening him to the truth. Skilled in means, Oking, was the Tathàgata. For the sake of scorning physicalbeauty the Master took Venerable Nanda to the celestialrealm to see the lovely maidens there115 and by means of apiece of clean white cloth did he awaken Venerable Cåëa-panthaka to the impurity of the body.”116113.S.

The Perfect Speech of the Buddha“Sàriputta the chief disciple said, ‘The Tathàgata is perfectin speech, there is no fault of speech in the Tathàgata con-cerning which he should have to take care that no one elseshould know it.’117 So why did the Buddha use harsh andabusive words to Sudinna the Kalanda and call him astupid fellow?”118“That was not out of rudeness, O king, but merely toshow him the foolish and contemptible nature of his con-duct in a way that would do him no harm. If any man inthis birth does not attain to perception of the Four NobleTruths, his life has been in vain. The Blessed One usedwords of truth, they were no exaggeration. He admonishedothers only to destroy the disease of unwholesomeness. Hiswords, even when stern, softened men’s pride and madethem humble. They were full of compassion and aimed atbenefit as the words of a father to his children.”23. The Talking Tree“The Tathàgata said:“Brahman! Why do you ask an unconscious thing,which cannot hear you, how it is today?117.D. iii. 217.118.Vin. iii. 20. The rule forbidding sexual intercourse was laid down because Sudinna was persuaded by his former wife to preserve the family line.

Listen to me.’120“If, Nàgasena, a tree is an unconscious thing then this latterstatement must be false.”“When the Blessed One said, ‘aspen tree’ it was just aconventional way of speaking, for though a tree being un-conscious cannot speak, the word ‘tree’ was used as a des-ignation for the deity who dwelt in it and this is a wellknown convention. Just, O king as a wagon laden with cornis called a ‘corn-wagon’ though it is not made of corn, it ismade of wood. The Tathàgata, when expounding theDhamma, did so by means of the common mode of speech.”24. The Last Meal“It was said by the elders who convened the First BuddhistCouncil, ‘When he had eaten Cunda the smith’s food, thushave I heard, the Buddha felt a dire sickness, a sharp paineven unto death.’121 Yet the Blessed One also said, ‘Thesetwo offerings of food, ânanda, are of equal merit and aremuch more effective than any others: that, after which the119.Jà. iii. 24.120.Jà. iv. 210.121.D. ii. 128."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"103Tathàgata attains to supreme enlightenment; and that, afterwhich the Tathàgata attains to parinibbàna’.122“If severe pains fell upon him after taking that lastmeal then the latter statement must be wrong.”“The last offering of food is of great advantage be-cause of the Tathàgata’s attainment of parinibbàna. It wasnot because of the food that the sickness fell upon the Bless-ed One but because of the extreme weakness of his bodyand the proximity of his death. These two offerings of foodwere of great and incomparable merit because of the attain-ment of the nine successive absorptions in forward and re-verse order, which the Tathàgata gained after partaking ofthat food.”25. Adoration of Relics“The Blessed One said, ‘Do not hinder yourselves, ânanda,with honouring the remains of the Tathàgata.’123 Yet on theother hand he said, ‘Honour the relics of him who is worthyof honour, acting in that way you will go from this world toheaven.’124 Which of these statements is right?”“It was not to all men, O king, but to the sons of theconqueror [monks] that the first advice was given. Payingreverence to relics is not their work, but rather grasping thetrue nature of all formations, reasoning [paying attention to122.D. ii. 135.123.D. ii. 141.124.Vv. 75 v 8."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104impermanence etc.], insight meditation, getting hold of theessence of the meditation object, devotion to their ownspiritual welfare, that is the work of the monks. Just, Oking, as it is the business of princes to learn the arts ofwarfare and the laws of property while husbandry, tradingand care of cattle are the business of householders.”26. The Buddha’s Foot is Injured“You say that when the Blessed One walked along, thegreat earth, unconscious though it is, filled up the hollowsand levelled the ground before his feet.125 Yet you say thata splinter of rock grazed his foot.126 Why then didn’t thatsplinter of rock turn away from his foot?”“O king, the splinter of rock did not fall by itself, but arock was thrown down by Devadatta. Two rocks cametogether and intercepted it but a splinter of rock broke off andgrazed the Blessed One’s foot. A thing intercepted can easilyslip through just as water taken up in the hands can easily slipthrough the fingers.”27. The True Recluse“The Blessed One said, ‘A man becomes a recluse by thedestruction of the floods [sensuality, desire for rebirth,125.Untraced, but cf. DA. 45.126.Vin. ii. 193."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"105personality belief and ignorance].’127 Yet he also said, ‘Heis known in the world as a recluse who has these fourqualities: patience, moderation in food, relinquishment andbeing without possessions.’128 Now these four qualities arealso found in those who are still imperfect, in whom thedefilements have not yet been totally rooted out. This too isa double-edged problem.”“Both these statements, O king, were made by theBlessed One but the first is an inclusive statement whereasthe second was said of the characteristics of recluses ingeneral.”28. The Boasting of the Buddha“The Blessed One said, ‘If anyone should speak in praise ofme, my teaching or the Order you should not on account ofthat be elated.’129 Yet he was so delighted when Sela theBrahman praised him that he magnified his own virtue andsaid, ‘A king, Sela, am I, the king supreme of righteousness.The royal chariot wheel of righteousness do I set rolling on— the wheel that no one can ever turn back.’130 This too isa double-edged problem.”“Both statements, O king, are correct but the first wasmade to set forth truthfully and exactly the real nature ofthe teaching. The second passage was not spoken for gain,127.A. ii. 238, Pug. 63.128.Jà. No. 441.129.D. L 3; cf. M. i. 140.130.M. ii.

Who Deserves Punishment?“The Blessed One said, ‘Doing no injury to anyone, dwellfull of love and kindness in the world.’131 Yet he also said,‘Restrain him who deserves restraint and encourage himwho deserves encouragement.’132 Now, restraint means thecutting off of hands and feet, imprisonment and so forth. Ifthe first statement is correct then the second cannot beright.”“O king, to do no injury is a doctrine approved of byall the Buddhas; the second injunction however was usedfiguratively. It means restrain the agitated mind, encouragethe slothful mind; restrain the unwholesome mind, encour-age the wholesome mind; restrain unwise reflection, en-courage wise reflection; restrain wrong practice, encourageright practice; the ignoble should be restrained, the nobleencouraged; the thief [the evil-minded monk who desiresgain, praise and fame] should be restrained and the honestman [the sincere monk who desires only to destroy defile-ments] should be encouraged.”“Now you have come round to the sense in my question.For how, venerable Nàgasena, is a robber to be subdued?”131.Jà.

Whosoever may be put todeath, he does not suffer execution by reason of the opinionput forward by the Tathàgata. He suffers by reason of whathe himself has done.”13330. Dismissal of the order“It was said by the Blessed One, ‘I harbour not anger norsulkiness’.134 Yet he dismissed Sàriputta and Moggallànawith their disciples.135 Was it then not in anger that he didthis?”“The Tathàgata did dismiss the monks but not inanger. It was due to what they themselves had done thatthey were dismissed. As the great earth does not feel angerif a man stumbles and falls. It is the man’s own fault thathe stumbles. So too the Blessed One does not feel ill-will ofany kind. He sent them away knowing, ‘It will be for theirgood, happiness, purification and deliverance fromsuffering’.”133.Capital punishment was the norm and severe corporal punishment was also practised in the Buddha’s time.134.Sn. v 19.135.M. ii.

The Murder of Moggallàna“This was said by the Blessed One, ‘Mog-gallàna is the chief of those among my dis-ciples who possess supernormal power.’136Yet he was beaten to death with clubs.137 Why did his pow-ers fail him?”“That, O king, was because he was then overwhelmedby the greater power of kamma. Even among things that arebeyond the scope of the imagination one may be more pow-erful than the others. Among things that are unimaginablekamma is the most powerful. It is precisely the effect ofkamma that overcomes and rules the rest, for no other influ-ence is of any avail to the man in whom kamma is workingout its inevitable result. Just as a man who has been foundguilty of a crime will be punished and there is nothing hisrelatives may do to prevent it.”32.

Just, O king, as the traditionsof warriors are handed down among warriors alone so it isthe tradition of the Tathàgatas that the recitation of thePàtimokkha should take place only among bhikkhus. TheVinaya is venerable and profound. He who has reachedproficiency in it may exhort others thus, ‘Let not thisprofound teaching fall into the hands of those who areunwise where it would be despised and condemned,treated shamefully, ridiculed and found fault with’.141 Justas there are priceless possessions of kings that should notbe used by men of the world, so too, the training and138.A. i. 283.139.Vin. i. 115, 135.140.There is no prohibition against teaching the Vinaya to lay people. A wise lay person should learn the Vinaya to avoid corrupting the monks.141.T.W. Rhys Davids had this to say about esoteric Buddhism; “The fact is that there has never been any such thing as esoteric teaching in Buddhism, and that the modern so called esoteric Buddhism is neither esoteric nor Buddhism. Its tenets, so far as they are Indian at all, are perfectly accessible, are well known to all those who choose to study the books of Indian mysticism, and are Hindu, not Buddhist. They are, indeed, quite contradictory to Buddhism, of which the authors of what they ignorantly call Esoteric Buddhism know but very little —- that little being only a portion of those beliefs which have been the common ground to all religious teachers in India. If one doctrine, more than any other, is distinctive of Buddhism, it is the ignoring, in ethics of the time-honoured belief in a soul — that is, in the old sense, in a separate creature inside the body, which flies out of it, like a bird out of a cage, when the body dies. Yet the Theosophists, who believe, I am told, in seven souls inside the human body (which would be worse according to true Buddhism than seven devils), still venture to call themselves Buddhists, and do not see the absurdity of their position!”"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110traditions of the Blessed One for bhikkhus are their pricelesspossessions.

Intentional Lying“It has been said by the Blessed One, ‘Intentional lying is anoffence involving expulsion.’142 Yet he also said, ‘Intention-al lying is a light offence that must be confessed to anotherbhikkhu.’143 How can both of these be right?”“If a man were to strike another with his hand whatpunishment would you give him?”“If the victim refused to overlook the matter we wouldfine the assailant.”“But if a man were to strike you, what punishmentwould you give him?”“We would cut off his hands and feet, scalp him,plunder all his wealth and uproot his family up to theseventh generation.”“Just so, O king, the offence is light or heavy accordingto the subject matter. Intentional lying about the attainmentof superhuman states such as the absorptions, supernormalpower or the paths of spiritual attainment is an offence in-volving expulsion. However, intentional lying about othermatters is only an offence involving confession.”142.Vin. iii. 94ff.143.Vin. iii. 59, 66; Vin. iv. 2."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"11134. Investigations of the Bodhisatta“It was said by the Blessed One in the discourse on naturallaw, ‘Long ago had the Bodhisatta’s parents, chief disciples,etc., been predestined for the Bodhisatta.’144 Yet it was alsosaid, ‘While still in the Tusita heaven the Bodhisatta makeseight investigations: whether the right moment has comefor him to be reborn, the continent, the country, the family,the mother, the time in the womb, the month of the birth,and the time of the going forth.’145 If his parents werealready predestined why was it necessary for him toconsider these things?”“Both these statements, O king, are correct. Withrespect to eight things the future should be investigated be-fore it comes to pass. A merchant should inspect goods be-fore he buys them, an elephant should try a path with histrunk before he treads it, a carter should survey a ford be-fore he crosses it, a pilot should plumb a shore he has notseen before, a physician should assess the remaining life-span of a patient before treating him, a traveller should in-spect a bridge before he walks on it, a bhikkhu should knowthe time before he starts his meal, and a Bodhisatta shouldinvestigate the family before he is born.”35. On suicide“It has been said by the Blessed One, ‘A monk should nottry to commit suicide [throw himself down from a preci-144.Mahàpadhàna Sutta, D. ii. 17-20.145.Jà. i. 48; DA. 428, (only 5 mentioned)."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112pice]; whoever does so should be dealt with according tothe rule.’146 Yet, on the other hand, you say that on what-ever topic he was addressing the monks, he always, andwith various similes, exhorted them to bring about the des-truction of birth, old age, disease and death, and whoso-ever overcame them he honoured with high praise.”“O king, it is because an arahant is of great benefit tobeings that he laid down that prohibition. One who hasreached the goal is like a boat to carry people over thefloods of sensuality, desire for rebirth, personality beliefand ignorance; like a mighty rain-cloud he fills their mindswith satisfaction and he is a guide to those who are lost. Outof compassion for living beings the Blessed One said, ‘Amonk is not to commit suicide.’ And what is the reason theBlessed One urged us to put an end to birth, old age anddeath? Because of the limitless nature of the suffering of theround of rebirths the Blessed One, out of compassion forbeings, urged them in many ways, with various similes tofree themselves from the round of rebirths.”36. Protection by Loving-kindness“It has been said by the Blessed One, ‘These eleven advan-tages may be expected by one who practises and makes ahabit of loving-kindness towards all beings: he sleeps inpeace; he wakes in peace; he dreams no evil dreams; he be-comes dear to human beings and to non-human beings; thegods protect him; neither fire, nor poison, nor weapons can146.Vin. iii. 74, 82 (an offence of wrong doing)."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"113harm him; his mind is quickly concentrated; his counten-ance is serene; he dies unconfused; and if he attains nohigher he is reborn in the Brahmà realm.’147 Why then wasthe youth Sàma, who dwelt full of loving-kindness, hit by apoisoned arrow fired by King Piliyakkha?”148“O king, these eleven virtues of loving-kindness aredependent on love itself and not on the character of theperson who practises it. Sàma practised the meditation onloving-kindness all the time. However, while he wascollecting water, his mind lapsed from the meditation andat that moment King Piliyakkha shot him, so the arrow wasable to hurt him.”37. Why Did Devadatta Prosper?“Although you say that good deeds lead to rebirth in heavenor fortunate human births and that evil deeds lead to rebirthin states of misery or unfortunate human births; Devadatta,who was full of evil qualities, was often born in a position ofsuperiority over the Bodhisatta,149 who was full of goodqualities. Thus, Nàgasena, when Devadatta became the fam-ily chaplain of Brahmadatta, the king of Benares, then theBodhisatta was a wretched outcaste. This is one case inwhich the Bodhisatta was inferior to Devadatta in birth andreputation. Again, when Devadatta became a king, a mightymonarch of the earth, the Bodhisatta was an elephant.

Devadatta was opposed by every-body but no one was hostile to the Bodhisatta. Yet, when hewas a king, Devadatta protected and served the people andgave gifts to recluses and brahmans according to his inclina-tion. Of no one can it be said, O king, that without generosity,self-restraint, observance of precepts and other virtues, he canreach prosperity. Nevertheless, all beings who are sweptalong in the endless round of rebirths meet with pleasant andunpleasant companions just as water whirled along in a rivermeets with pure and impure things. However, the compari-son between the Bodhisatta and Devadatta should be regard-ed in the light of the unimaginable length of the round ofrebirths; and it should also be remembered that the Bodhisattawas in heaven for aeons while Devadatta boiled in hell.”38. The Weakness of Women“It is said that a woman will always commit adultery if shefinds a suitable lover.150 Yet Mahàsodha’s wife refused todo any wrong even though offered a thousand pieces ofgold.”151150.Jà. No. 542 (Jà. v. 435). One should not overlook the fact that if a woman does commit adultery, at least one man is usually involved too. So one should not infer that men are any more virtuous than women. If one finds a passage about women that seems derogatory, one should remember that such exhortations were given to celibate monks to restrain their natural inclinations.

Theyrealised that if they didn’t move the elephant wouldn’t beable to approach. ânanda, who was not yet an arahant,remained by the Buddha’s side to protect him and thus hiscourage and devotion were displayed.

Restraint of the Stomach“The Blessed One said, ‘Do not be heedless in standing foralms, be restrained regarding the stomach.’157 However,he also said, ‘There were times, Udàyi, when I ate a fullbowl of food or even more.’158 This too is a double-edgedproblem.”“Both statements are correct, O king, but the formerstatement is inclusive and cannot be proved wrong. Hewho has no restraint as regards the stomach will kill livingbeings or steal for the sake of his stomach. It was bearingthis in mind that the Blessed One said, ‘Do not be heedlessin standing for alms, be restrained regarding the stomach.’He who has self-control gains a clear insight into the FourNoble Truths and fulfils the life of a recluse. Didn’t a mereparrot, O king, by his restraint as to his stomach shake theheaven of the thirty-three and bring down Sakka to wait onhim?159 However, when the Blessed One said, ‘There weretimes, Udàyi, when I ate a full bowl of food or even more’it was concerning himself. He had accomplished all thatcan be accomplished by restraint, and like a perfect gemthat needs no more polishing, he needed no more training.”157.Dhp. v 168.

If the first statement istrue then why was the Buddha less healthy than Bakkula?”“Although it is true that Bakkula surpassed the Buddhain the matter of health and other disciples also surpassedhim in other aspects yet the Blessed One surpassed them allin respect of virtue, concentration and wisdom; and it wasin reference to this that he spoke the verse, ‘I, monks, am aBrahman, one to ask a favour of, always ready to give; thisbody that I bear will be my last, I am the supreme healerand physician’.”“The Blessed One, O king, whether he is sick or not;whether he is practising the ascetic practices or not — thereis no other being comparable to him.

Now an evil act done by a madman is notconsidered a grievous offence, nor is it grievous in respectof the fruit that it brings in a future life. Suppose, O king,that a madman had been guilty of a capital offence, whatpunishment would you inflict upon him?”“What punishment is due to a madman? We shouldorder him to be beaten and set free, that is all.”“So then, O king, it follows that the offence of onewho is mad is pardonable.167 Just so was it in the case ofLomasa Kassapa who, after he regained his senses, re-nounced the world and became assured of rebirth in theBrahmà realm.”46.

Just, O king, as even the coolest water will becomewarm when in contact with fire so, Jotipàla, though he wasfull of merit, yet when he was reborn into a family of un-believers he became as if blind and reviled the Tathàgata.However, when he went to the presence of the Buddha Kas-sapa he realised his virtue and became his devoted disciple.”47.

King or Brahman?“The Blessed One said, ‘I, monks, am a Brahman, one to aska favour of.’172 However, he also said, ‘A king, Sela, am I.’173If, Nàgasena, he was a king, then he must have spokenfalsely when he said he was a Brahman, for he must havebeen either a Khattiya (a warrior) or a Brahman, he couldnot have belonged to both castes.”“It was not on account of his birth that he called him-self a Brahman but because he was free from defilements,had attained to the certainty of knowledge and because hewas one who maintained the ancient traditions of teachingand learning by heart, self-control and discipline.174 As a172.Iti. 101.173.Sn. v 554.174.See Dhp.

Right Livelihood“You say that the Blessed One did not accept alms receivedby chanting verses175 but when preaching to laymen hegenerally spoke first of the benefits of giving and acceptedthe gifts offered.176 If the first is true then why did he acceptgifts gained by preaching?”“It is the custom of the Tathàgatas to preach first of thebenefits of giving to soften men’s hearts before going on topreach of morality and higher matters but not on account ofthat could they justly be accused of hinting to get gifts. Thereis hinting that is improper and there is hinting that is blame-less. Herein, if a bhikkhu begs for alms standing in an in-convenient place or making signs this is improper hinting;177but if he stands in the proper place where there are peoplewho want to give and moves on if they do not want to givethen this is proper and does not amount to hinting. That mealof the ploughman was offered in order to refute the subject ofthe verse recited, therefore the Tathàgata rejected it.”175.S. i. 167, Sn. v 81.176.cf. D. i.

Was it then becauseof fear, or lack of clarity, or weakness, or because he was notomniscient that he hesitated?”“No, great king, it was for none of those reasons. Itwas due to the profound nature of the Dhamma and to theexceedingly strong passion and delusion of beings that theBlessed One hesitated and considered to whom he shouldteach it and in what manner so that they would under-stand. Just, O king, as a king when he calls to mind themany people who gain their livelihood in dependence onhim — the body-guards, courtiers, merchants, soldiers,messengers, ministers and nobles — he might be exercisedat the thought; ‘How can I conciliate them all?’ Just so,O king, when the Tathàgata called to mind the strong pas-sion and delusion of beings that he inclined rather to inac-tion than to preaching. It is also in the natural order ofthings that the Buddha should teach the Dhamma at the re-quest of Brahmà, for at that time all men were worshippersof Brahmà and placed their reliance on him.

In the world with its gods no one equals me.’180Again he said, ‘In this way, monks, did âëàra the Kàlàma,being my teacher, set me, his pupil, on exactly the samelevel as himself and honour me with the highest honour.’181This too is a double-edged problem.”“O king, when the Blessed One spoke of âëàra theKàlàma as his teacher he referred to the time when he wasstill a Bodhisatta and before he had attained Buddhahood.He was merely a teacher of worldly wisdom.

Gifts to the order“When Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã offered a bathing robe185 tothe Buddha he told her, ‘Give it to the Order, Gotamã. If yougive it to the Order I will be honoured and the Order too.’Was it because the Order is more important than theBuddha?”“O king, it was not because an offering to him wouldnot bear great fruit, but in order to show the greatness ofthe Order so that in times to come the Order might beesteemed. As, sir, a father praises his son in the royal courtthinking, ‘If he is established here now, he will be honouredby the people after I am gone’. Or suppose, O king, someman should bring a present to a king and the king present-ed that gift to someone else — to a soldier or a messenger— would that man therefore become superior to the king?”“Certainly not, venerable sir.

That is why he canquickly accomplish any task that he undertakes; just, Oking, as your javelin, because it is smooth and straight, canquickly reach its target.”55. The Practice of Austerities“When the Bodhisatta was practising austerity with theutmost exertion he did not reach his goal, so he abandonedthat practice thinking, ‘Might there not be some other wayto liberation?’190 Yet when instructing his disciples he said:“Bestir yourselves, renounce,Exert yourselves in my teaching,And destroy death’s armyAs an elephant a house of reeds.”191“Why then did the Tathàgata instruct his disciples to followa course that he himself had abandoned?”“Because then, O king, and still now too, that is theonly path and it is along that path that the Bodhisattaattained Buddhahood. Although the Bodhisatta, exerting190.M. i. 246.191.S. i. 156, Kvu. 203, Thag 256."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131himself strenuously, reduced the food he was taking tonothing at all, and by that lack of food became weak, yetwhen he returned to the use of solid food, it was by exertionthat he attained Buddhahood. There was no fault inexertion itself but it was due only to the lack of food thatexertion failed to bring its result. If a man, through toomuch haste, were to become exhausted and fall down,unable to go on, it would not be the fault of the earth thathe fell down but due to his excessive exertion. If a manwere to wear a robe and never have it washed, the faultwould not lie with the water but with the man. That is whythe Tathàgata exhorted and led his disciples along that verypath; for that path is always ready, and always right.”56. Reverting to Laylife“Is it right to admit laymen to the Order before they haveattained to the path of stream-entry? If such men give up themonk’s life people might think that the religion is fruitless.”“If, O king, there was a pond of pure water and a manin need of a bath went there but turned back withoutbathing would the people blame the man or the pond?”“They would blame the man.”“Even so, O king, the Tathàgata has constructed thepond full of the pure Dhamma thinking, ‘Those who havedefilements but are intelligent can remove their defile-ments here.’ However, if anyone should revert to thehousehold life without having removed his defilements,then the people would blame him, there would be no rea-son to find fault with the teaching.

If a man, having had a bathingpond dug, said, ‘Let only those who have already bathedmake use of it’ would that be of any use? Moreover, thosewho revert to the household life thereby show up fivespecial qualities of the conqueror’s teaching. They showhow glorious it is, how pure it is, how free from associationwith evil, how difficult it is to penetrate the Dhamma andhow many are the restraints of the holy life.“How do they show its glory? Just, O king, as a manof low birth, poor and unintelligent, who comes into pos-session of a mighty kingdom, will soon be overthrown anddeprived of his glory. So too, those who are without wis-dom and have little merit, when they renounce the world,are unable to carry out the teaching of the Conqueror andrevert to the lower state.“How do they show its purity? Just, O king, as water,when it falls onto a lotus, slips off and cannot adhere to it;so too, those who are impure by nature, crafty and holdersof wrong views; when they have been admitted to thereligion of the Conqueror, it is not long before they dispersefrom that pure and faultless religion, unable to adhere to it.“How do they show its freedom from associationwith evil? Just as the ocean does not tolerate the presence ofa corpse but quickly brings it ashore and casts it on dryland; so too, O king, those who are evil-minded and lazyare unable to remain in the Order in association with thearahants who are free from stains.“How do they show how hard the Dhamma is topenetrate?

The Mastery of the Arahants“You say that the arahant feels only one kind of feeling;physical feeling but not mental feeling.192 How can this beso? The arahant keeps going by means of his body. Has hethen no power over his body? Even a bird is the ruler overthe nest in which it dwells.”“O king, there are ten conditions inherent in the bodyover which the arahant has no control: cold, heat, hunger,thirst, excrement, urine, fatigue, old age, disease and death.Just as all beings living on the great earth depend on it buthave no control over it, so the arahant depends on his bodybut has no control over it.”“Why, Nàgasena, does the ordinary man feel both192.Untraced."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"134bodily and mental feeling?”“Because of the untrained state of his mind. Like ahungry ox tied up by a weak grass rope would easily breakfree, so an ordinary man’s mind becomes agitated by pain,so he feels mental pain too. However, the arahant’s mind iswell trained, so when his body is affected by pain he fixeshis mind firmly on the idea of impermanence. His mind isnot agitated and he feels no mental pain, just as the trunk ofa great tree is unmoved by the wind although its branchesmay sway.”58. Heinous Crimes“If a layman had committed a heinous crime193 before heentered the Order but was unaware of it, would he be ableto attain the path of a stream-winner?”“No, he would not, because the basis for understand-ing the Dhamma has been destroyed in him.”“But you say that to him who is aware of an offencethere comes remorse, which causes an obstruction in themind, and so he cannot comprehend the truth.194 Yet in himwho is unaware of his offence there is no remorse and heremains with peace of mind.”“If, O king, a man had eaten poison but was not awareof it, would he still die?”193.The Pali has Pàràjika (offence of defeat) but a layman cannot commit these offences. What is meant is: killing one’s mother, one’s father, an arahant, drawing blood from a Tathàgata or violating a nun (the Sinhalese also gives damaging a bodhi tree). One guilty of these offences should not be ordained. If they are ordained they should be expelled.194.cf.

It must beas you say; and I accept it thus.”59. The Unvirtuous“What is the difference between a layman who has donewrong and a monk who has done wrong?”“There are ten qualities that distinguish a monk ofpoor moral habit from a layman of poor moral habit: he isfull of reverence for the Buddha, Dhamma and Saïgha; herecites the scriptures and asks about the meaning, he hasheard much, he enters an assembly with dignity because hefears reproach, he guards himself in body and speech, hesets his mind on exertion, he is in company with the monks,and if he does any wrong he is discreet. Furthermore, in tenways he purifies gifts of faith. By wearing the robe of theBuddhas, by his shaven head he bears the mark of sages, bybeing in company with other monks, by his having takenrefuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saïgha, by his dwell-ing in a lonely place suitable for exertion, by his quest forthe wealth of the Dhamma, by preaching the excellentDhamma, because he takes the Dhamma as his guidinglight, because he regards the Buddha as supreme, and byhis observance of the Uposatha.195 For all these reasons he is195.The full moon and new moon days on which the monks recite the disciplinary rules."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136worthy of offerings even though he has fallen from virtue.Just as hot water extinguishes a fire, a monk of poor moralhabit purifies the gift of benefactors, for this was said by theTathàgata in the Majjhima Nikàya:“Whoever is virtuous and gives to the unvirtuous,A gift rightfully acquired, The mind well pleased,Firmly believing in the rich fruit of kamma,This is an offering purified by the giver.”196“Wonderful, Nàgasena, though I asked you an ordinaryquestion you have given me an extraordinary answer, as askilled cook would take an ordinary piece of meat andmake with it a meal fit for a king.”60.

Just as in some areas afarmer can successfully grow crops without a fence butelsewhere he must first build a fence or a wall before he cangrow a crop; or as one with supernormal powers can easilypick the fruits at the top of a tall tree but others have to con-struct a ladder first. Likewise, learning, enquiry, and otherworks are like a ladder and are helpful to those monks toreach the fruits of the four attainments.

These things, Oking, are not wrong in the eyes of the world but they arewrong for a monk. An arahant is incapable of transgressingthe former type of precept but he may break the other kindbecause he doesn’t know everything. He may not know thetime of day or the name and clan of some woman but everyarahant knows about freedom from suffering.”64. What is Not Found in the World“There are many different things found in the world,Nàgasena, but tell me what is not to be found in theworld.”“There are three things, O king, that are not to befound in the world: anything, either conscious or uncon-scious, that does not decay and perish, that formation(saïkhàra) or conditioned thing that is permanent, and inthe ultimate sense there is no such thing as a being.”201201.Untraced."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"14065.

If there is afather of a child we would expect to find a father of thefather. Just so, if there is a cause for the realisation of nibbànawe would expect to find a cause for its arising.”“Nibbàna, O king, is unconstructed, therefore no causehas been pointed out for its production.

Modes of Production“What is it that is kamma-born, what cause-born, and whatseason-born? What is it that is none of these?”“All beings, O king are kamma-born. Fire, and all thingsgrowing out of seeds are cause-born. The earth, water andwind are season-born. Space and nibbàna exist independent-ly of kamma, cause and season. Of nibbàna, O king, it cannotbe said that it is perceptible by the five senses, but it is per-ceptible by the mind.

Laying Down of Rules for Monks“Those who are famous doctors are able to prescribe suit-able medicine for a disease before the disease has ariseneven though they are not omniscient. Why then, did theTathàgata not lay down the rules for monks before theoccasion arose but only when an offence had been commit-ted and a great hue and cry was heard.”“The Tathàgata, O king, knew beforehand that all onehundred and fifty202 rules would have to be laid down buthe thought, ‘If I lay down all of these rules at once there willbe those who will not enter the Order for fear of the manyregulations to be observed, therefore I will lay down therules as the need arises’.”20369. The Heat of the Sun“Why is the heat of the sun sometimes fierce and some-times not?”202.Mentioned also in Dilemma 54.

The Gift of Vessantara“Venerable Nàgasena, do all the Bodhi-sattas give away their wives and children,or was it only Vessantara?”205“All of them do.”“But do those wives and children consent to it?”“The wives do but the children do not due to theirtender age.”“But was it then a meritorious deed if the childrenwere terrified and cried at being given away?”“Yes it was. As a man desiring merit might take a crip-ple wherever he wanted to go in an ox-cart and thereby theoxen would be made to suffer; or as a king might levy a tax inorder to perform a great meritorious deed; so too, giving,though it may cause anguish to some, is conducive to rebirthin heaven. Is there, O king, any gift that should not be given?”“Yes, Nàgasena, there are ten kinds of gifts that shouldnot be given, the giving of which leads to rebirth in states ofwoe: a gift of intoxicants, of a festival, of a woman, of aman,206 of suggestive designs, weapons, poisons, chains or205.Jà.

I am asking if there is any gift that should notbe given when there is someone worthy of it.”“Then, Nàgasena, there is no gift that should not begiven. When satisfaction in Dhamma has arisen, some peoplegive a hundred thousand, or a kingdom or even their life.”“Then why do you criticize the gift of Vessantara soharshly? Is it not sometimes the case that a man in debt maysell his son or leave him as a pledge? Just so, Vessantaragave his son as a pledge against his future attainment ofomniscience.”“Nevertheless, why did he not give himself instead?”“Because that was not what was asked for. To offersomething else would have been ignoble. Furthermore, Oking, Vessantara knew that the Brahmin would be unableto keep the children as slaves for long since he was ad-vanced in years. Anyway, he knew their grandfatherwould pay a ransom for their return.”“Skilfully, Nàgasena, has this puzzle been unrav-elled. The net of heresy has been torn to pieces. Well has theletter of the scriptures been maintained while you havethus explained the spirit. This is so and I accept it as yousay.”72.

It was in order to bring his know-ledge to maturity that he had to practise the austerities.”“Why then, Nàgasena, did he go forth while hisknowledge was still immature? Why didn’t he first maturehis knowledge and then renounce the world?”“When the Bodhisatta, O king, saw the women of hisharem sleeping in disorder, then he became disgusted anddiscontented. On perceiving that his mind was filled withdiscontent, Màra said, ‘Seven days from now you willbecome a Universal Monarch’. Yet, as if a red-hot iron barhad entered his ear, the Bodhisatta was filled with alarmand fear. Furthermore, O king, the Bodhisatta thought, ‘Letme not incur blame among gods and men as being withoutoccupation or means. Let me be a man of action and con-stant in earnestness.’ Thus did the Bodhisatta undertakethe austerities to bring his knowledge to maturity.”“Venerable Nàgasena, when the Bodhisatta was un-dergoing austerities it occurred to him ‘Might there not besome other path to higher knowledge worthy of noblemen?’ Was he then confused about the correct way?”“There are twenty-five conditions, O king, that causeweakness of mind: wrath, enmity, contempt, arrogance,envy, meanness, deceit, hypocrisy, obstinacy, contention,207.M.

The Bodhisatta had sought after the perception ofthe Four Noble Truths for many aeons so how could therearise any confusion in his mind as to the way? Nevertheless,he thought, ‘Might there not be some other way to wisdom?’Formerly the Bodhisatta, when he was only one month old,had attained the four absorptions while meditating underthe rose-apple tree while his father was ploughing.”208“Very good, Nàgasena, I accept it as you say. It waswhile bringing his knowledge to maturity that the Bodhi-satta practised the austerities.”73. The Power of Evil“Which is more powerful, wholesomeness or unwhole-someness?”209“Wholesomeness is more powerful, O king.”“That is something I cannot believe, for those who doevil often experience the result of their deeds in this verylife when they are punished for their crimes,210 but is thereanyone who, by offering alms to the Order or by observingthe Uposatha has received the benefit in this very life?”208.M. i. 246, Jà. i. 57.209.cf.

However, if there was a mighty cloudburstwould the water spread around?”“Certainly, venerable sir, even for ten or twelve leagues.”“Just so, O king, wholesomeness is great and byreason of its abundance can be shared by gods and men.”“Venerable Nàgasena, why is it that unwholesome-ness is so limited and wholesomeness so much more far-reaching?”“Whoever, O king, gives gifts, observes the preceptsand performs the Uposatha, he is glad and at peace, and be-ing peaceful his goodness grows even more abundantly.Like a deep pool of water from which as soon as waterflows away on one side it is replenished from all around.Just so, O king, if a man were to transfer to others the meritof any good he had done even for a hundred years the morewould his goodness grow.

One dreams when onesleeps ‘the monkey’s sleep’, which is midway between sleepand consciousness.”76. Premature Death“Venerable Nàgasena, do all living beings die when theirlife-span comes to an end or do some die prematurely?”“Both, O king. Like fruits on a tree that fall sometimeswhen ripe and sometimes before they are ripe due to thewind, or insects or sticks, so too, some beings die whentheir life-span ends but others die prematurely.”“But Nàgasena, all those who die prematurely,whether they are young or old, have reached the end oftheir predetermined life-span. There is no such thing aspremature death.”“O king, there are seven kinds of premature death forthose who, though they still have some life-span remaining,die prematurely: starvation, thirst, snake-bite, poison, fire,drowning, weapons.

Give me another reason for that.”“A mighty fire, O king, that is exhausted and goes outwhen its fuel has been totally consumed and not before thatby some other reason, is said to have gone out in the full-ness of time. Just so a man who dies in old-age without anyaccident is said to reach the end of the life-span. However,in the case of a fire that is put out by a mighty cloudburst itcould not be said that it had gone out in the fullness of time;so too whoever dies before his time due to any cause otherthan kamma is said to die a premature death.”77. Miracles at Shrines of Arahants“Are there miracles at the shrines (cetiya) of all the arahantsor only at some?”“Only at some. By the volitional determination ofthree kinds of individuals there is a miracle: by an arahantwhile he is still alive, by deities, or by a wise disciple whohas confidence. If there is no such volitional determinationthen there is no miracle even at the shrine of an arahant whohad supernormal powers.

Is there, Oking, such a thing as the bliss of the sovereignty of kings?”“Yes there is.”“Is it mixed with pain?”“No.”“But why is it then, O king, that when the frontierprovinces have revolted kings have to set out from theirpalaces and march over uneven ground, tormented bymosquitoes and hot winds, and engage in fierce battles atthe risk of their lives?”“That, venerable Nàgasena, is not the bliss of sover-eignty.

Make it clear and elucidate it. It is a point on whichpeople are bewildered and lost in doubt. Break this dart ofuncertainty.”“The element of nibbàna does exist, O king, and hewho practises rightly and who rightly comprehends theformations according to the teachings of the Conqueror, he,by his wisdom, realises nibbàna.219.Untraced.
