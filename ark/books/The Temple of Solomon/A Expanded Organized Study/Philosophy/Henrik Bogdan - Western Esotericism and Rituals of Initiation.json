The primar y object of their research,however, has been focused on non-Western rituals to such an extent that,with a few notable exceptions, there hardly are any scholarly works deal-ing in depth with Western rituals of initiation. There are a number ofreasons for this situation, but chief among them is the connection ofWestern initiator y societies with Western esotericism—and the latter onlyrecently received a long overdue scholarly attention. As will presently bediscussed, scholars such as Antoine Faivre and Wouter J. Hanegraaff havedemonstrated how Western esotericism has developed from a subjectdeemed unworthy of scholarly interest, to a fruitful and challenging fieldof research that has received wide academic recognition.The purpose of this study is twofold; first, on a more general level,I wish to present the development of the phenomenon of, what I call,“masonic rituals of initiation” from an historical perspective. By masonicrituals of initiation I do not merely mean rituals of initiation of Freema-sonr y, but also rituals deriving from Freemasonr y, which have certainstructural components in common with the former. Second, I will ana-lyze the relationship between masonic rituals of initiation and Westernesotericism, and thus analyze how esotericism is transmitted through,what I call, “Western esoteric rituals of initiation.” In this connection Iwill address two basic questions: How is Western esotericism transmit-ted through the Western esoteric rituals of initiation? And: What “types”of esotericism are transmitted? The study thus consequently covers twofields of research, rituals of initiation and Western esotericism.My methodological approach is historical and contextual, which inpractice means that the rituals that are analyzed are placed in theirhistorical context. Furthermore, I have restricted myself to written ritualtexts only in my analysis. In other words, I make no claims to haveavailed myself of any in-depth or quantitative inter views, nor any partici-pant obser vations. Valuable as such methods undeniably are, I have1"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationchosen to limit myself in this capacity. However, over the years of writ-ing this book, I have had ample opportunities to meet and discuss thepractical aspects of rituals of initiation with modern practitioners ofWestern esoteric rituals of initiation, and to a lesser extent personallyexperienced various forms of rituals of initiation, both as an initiate andin the capacity of an officiating of ficer. These contacts and experienceshave been important for my understanding of the texts I have chosen toanalyze, but I have deliberately chosen not to include these aspects inthis study. My methodological approach to Western esotericism can bedescribed, in the words of Hanegraaff, as a generalist in the study ofWestern esotericism; that is, my approach to the subject is from a broaderperspective, concretized by basic research paradigms. The latter consistof the paradigms proposed by Faivre and Hanegraaff, which for the sakeof simplicity can be called esotericism as “a form of thought” (Faivre)and esotericism as gnosis (Hanegraaff). The ritual texts that are ana-lyzed have been chosen because they are representative of differenthistorical periods, and thus reflect major trends in the development ofWestern esoteric rituals of initiation. I have limited myself strictly topublished ritual texts in the analysis, and as far as possible tried to availmyself of more than one published version in order to discuss variantreadings. In certain cases I have used manuscript versions of the ritualsin order to check the accuracy of the printed versions.It should be stressed that, from a methodological perspective, thisthesis is not concerned with what masonic rites of initiation might “do”with the initiate, nor what the implications of this type of rite might be.This work is concerned with the relationship of Western esotericismand masonic ritual texts.Chapters 1 and 2 are devoted to the previous research of Westernesotericism and rituals of initiation. Chapter 3 is an outlined historicalbackground of Western esotericism offered as an introduction to read-ers unfamiliar with the histor y of Western esotericism. It stretches fromthe Renaissance to the publication of the so-called Rosicrucian manifes-tos at the beginning of the seventeenth centur y. Although there prob-ably never existed a secret Rosicrucian fraternity at this period, the ideaof secret or closed societies that were considered to be guardians of anesoteric doctrine, was firmly imbedded in Western culture as a result ofthe publication of, and the subsequent debate on, these manifestos.Chapter 4 is devoted to an analysis of the Craft rituals of Freemasonr y—the blueprints, as it were, of all later masonic rituals of initiation. Itcovers the period from 1697 to 1730, during which the masonic systemof initiation developed from a system of two degrees to a three-degreesystem.

Finally, chapter 8 is devoted to the firstWestern esoteric initiator y New Religious Movement in the true senseof the word, Gerald Gardner’s witchcraft movement of the 1950s."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Chapter 1Western EsotericismIntroductionThe academic study of Western esotericism has in recent years devel-oped into an important field of research. Scholars such as Antoine Faivreand Wouter J. Hanegraaff have contributed in placing Western esotericismfirmly on the agenda of modern scholarship.1 The impact and recogni-tion of this new field of research is shown by conferences and organiza-tions being formed on the subject;2 academic journals and book serieswith a focus on esotericism are established;3 and academic chairs de-voted to esotericism have been created.4The area covered by the term Western esotericism is vast, and itincludes such apparently diverse phenomena as Renaissance hermeti-cism, nineteenth- and twentieth-centur y occultism, and New Age interalia. Somewhat crudely, esotericism can be described as a Western formof spirituality that stresses the importance of the individual effort to gainspiritual knowledge, or gnosis, whereby man is confronted with the di-vine aspect of existence. Furthermore, there usually is a strong holistictrait in esotericism where the godhead is considered manifest in thenatural world—a world interconnected by so-called correspondences.Man is seen as a microcosm of the macrocosm, the divine universe.Through increased knowledge of the individual self, it is often regardedas possible to achieve corresponding knowledge about nature, andthereby about God. However, the interpretation of what gnosis “actuallyis,” or what the correspondences “actually are,” differs considerably inthe histor y of Western esotericism.These ideas can be found already in antiquity, especially in gnos-ticism and hermetism, but it was not until the Renaissance that Western5"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationesotericism, as understood by the majority of scholars today, emerged.At this particular point in histor y, there occurred a period of intensifiedsyncretism in which a number of diverse traditions intermingled: tradi-tions such as Neoplatonism, mysticism, Jewish Kabbalah, medieval ritualmagic, and hermetism/hermeticism were seen as compatible, and a “new”form of thought gradually appeared—Western esotericism.From the Renaissance onward esotericism can be seen as an un-derlying form of thought that can be traced in a number of currents ortraditions. In the present work it will be analyzed how this form ofthought entered the world of initiator y societies, and more specificallyhow esotericism was transmitted through masonic rituals of initiation. Itshould, however, be emphasized at the outset that Western esotericism,in the present context, is not to be understood as a tradition in itself, butrather as a scholarly construct. This construct is aimed at providing anunderstanding of diverse currents, which, although they have certainaspects in common, more often than not differ significantly in form andcontent. It should furthermore be stressed that Western esotericism isnot to be interpreted as dealing with a separate phenomenon as such, butas a number of phenomena that have been more or less integrated withvarious trends of Western culture. It is thus a highly complex field ofresearch that constitutes the academic discipline of Western esotericism.The Delimitation of a Field of ResearchWestern esotericism, as an academic discipline, is of a relatively recentdate. Prior to the appearance of the works of Frances Yates in the 1960sthe study of Western esotericism had been confined to works dealingwith only specific aspects of esotericism, often without any attempt atplacing these aspects in a larger context.5 In fact, the academic commu-nity at large often viewed areas of research connected to Westernesotericism with suspicion, or even contempt. There are a number ofreasons for this negative attitude toward study of Western esotericism.Hanegraaff stresses the fact that esotericism “emerged as a syncretistictype of religiosity in a Christian context, and its representatives wereChristians until far into the eighteenth centur y,”6 and this is probablyone of the reasons why the study of Western esotericism was reser vedto theologians. By tradition, historians of religion have to a large extentleft the research into Christian currents to theologians, and they, in theirturn, have often viewed esoteric currents as heresies.Another reason for the negative attitude can be traced in the par-ticular form of knowledge at which esotericists have aimed. Westernculture is sometimes, somewhat simplistically, viewed as resting on two"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"7Western Esotericismpillars: Greek rationality and Christian faith. The knowledge strived forby the esotericists is, however, “characterised by a resistance to thedominance of either pure rationality or doctrinal faith.”7 According tovan den Broek and Hanegraaff, the knowledge of the esotericists is ofa revelator y and experiential nature:The adherents of this tradition emphasized the importance ofinner enlightenment or gnosis: a revelator y experience thatmostly entailed an encounter with one’s true self as well withthe ground of being, God.8Western esotericism can thus be viewed as a third pillar of Westernculture, a form of thought that took a middle position between doctrinalfaith and rationality. To the adherents of doctrinal faith, however, thistype of knowledge or gnosis smacked of heresy, while the promoters ofrationality accused it of irrationality and metaphysical reasoning. It should,however, be stressed that these three forms of knowledge were notwatertight compartments, but on the contrar y highly complex and inter-connected currents. For instance, esotericism played a significant partin the development of modern science, with many scientists beingesotericists at the same time.9 In other words, different strategies ofattaining knowledge did not necessarily exclude one another. This wouldlater change and lead to a forceful denunciation of, and distancing from,esotericism by the promoters of modern natural sciences.The study of Western esotericism can be approached from a num-ber of perspectives, and Hanegraaff has distinguished authors onesotericism into five groups:(1) perennialists or traditionalists(2) religionists(3) historians of science and philosophy(4) specialists on specific currents(5) generalists in the study of Western esotericism10The first group, perennialists or traditionalists, sees the established worldreligions as outer manifestations of an inner, common, “esoteric” tradi-tion based on specific metaphysical doctrines. According to Hanegraaff,this group parallels dogmatic theology and can thus be seen as an ex-plicit religious pursuit, rather than an academic approach to the study ofWestern esotericism.11 Furthermore, traditionalists are essentially anti-modern and reject the values of modern society. Nevertheless, the aca-demic merits of scholars influenced by perennialism, such as Mircea"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationEliade, should not be underestimated. Their approach to the study ofreligions in general is comparative, and this is reflected in their under-standing of esotericism, which is seen as a universal phenomenon.The religionists, on the other hand, are more implicit in theirdogmatic approach to the study of esotericism.12 This approach is typi-fied by the cultic milieu of Eranos meetings from 1933 onward.13 Manyof the scholars associated with the Eranos, such as Mircea Eliade (1907–1986) and Joseph Campbell (1904–1987), were driven by the convictionthat modern man needs religious symbols and myths, and the nonde-nominational spirituality that evolved in connection with the Eranosmeetings was well adapted to the beliefs and principles of the counter-culture of the 1960s. Ideas originating from the Eranos group were wellreceived in the New Age movement and in popular culture. For instance,the enormously successful Star Wars movies were to a large extentinfluenced by the writings of Joseph Campbell.14The third group, historians of science and philosophy, generallymaintained a negative attitude toward esotericism up until the appear-ance of the works of Frances Yates. Esoteric beliefs and practices wereoften considered to embody unreason and unscientific reasoning, andwere thus held to be in opposition to the positivistic ideals of naturalscience. Yates, on the contrar y, argued that the hermetic tradition (un-derstood as esotericism) was not only congenial to modern science, butthe causal factor in the emergence of modern science. This drastic re-interpretation of the emergence of modern science has been criticized,but Yates’ theories have nonetheless been instrumental in changing theattitude of historians of science and philosophy toward esotericism. Today,the categorical stance against ever ything connected to esotericism isnot as prevalent as it used to be among this categor y of scholars. In-stead, esotericism is often seen as an important factor in the understand-ing of early modern science.The specialists of particular currents and personalities of esotericismform a large categor y of scholars. The prime characteristic of this typeof scholar, from a methodological point of view, is that the subject oftheir research is not placed in a larger context, but rather studied as anindependent phenomenon.Finally, the generalists in the study of Western esotericism ap-proach the subject of their research from a broader perspective, concret-ized by a basic research paradigm. In the following discussion of re-search paradigms formulated specifically for the study of Westernesotericism in a general sense, I will limit myself to the ones proposedby Yates, Faivre, and Hanegraaff."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"9Western EsotericismThe Research Paradigms of Western EsotericismBefore discussing the research paradigms of Yates, Faivre, andHanegraaff, mention should be made of an often-overlooked early gen-eralist approach to the study of Western esotericism. The amateur scholarArthur Edward Waite (1857–1942) wrote extensively on various aspectsof Western esotericism, such as alchemy, Rosicrucianism, ceremonialmagic, occultism, and Freemasonr y, and actually saw these differentaspects as part of a larger whole, which he termed The Secret Tradition.While lacking a research paradigm, and not offering a clear definition ofThe Secret Tradition, it is clear that to Waite the prime object of thistradition is a mystical union with Christ. Waite’s “scholarly” approach toWestern esotericism was, to a certain extent, a mixture of a traditional-ist, religionist, and generalist approach. Notwithstanding the fact thatWaite’s research to a large extent today is outdated, he was often citedas an authority on Western esotericism by scholars, such as Yates,working in this field.15Dame Frances Yates (1899–1981), historian and art historian of theRenaissance, was the first scholar to study Renaissance esotericism andRosicrucianism as a coherent cultural phenomenon. By the early 1940sYates was employed by the Warburg Institute, today part of the Univer-sity of London, where she concentrated her research on the artistic andliterar y efforts of the French academies of the sixteenth centur y. At theend of the 1940s she began to concentrate her research on the hermeti-cism of the Renaissance. Her research resulted in Giordano Bruno andthe Hermetic Tradition (1964), and it was further expanded into The Artof Memory (1967), The Rosicrucian Enlightenment (1972), and The OccultPhilosophy in the Elizabethan Age (1979). Yates challenged the estab-lished histor y of the Renaissance and showed the importance of, whatshe called, “the Hermetic Tradition” to influential Renaissance thinkerssuch as Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, and Giordano Bruno. Sheargued that the Hermetic Tradition is crucial to the understanding ofthe Renaissance and the development of modern science. Yates set outto rediscover what she perceived to be an ignored part of our culturalheritage, and thereby to rewrite histor y. The main thesis of Yates re-search has been summarized by Hanegraaff as the “Yates Paradigm”:This “Yates Paradigm,” which has remained dominant throughthe 1970s and only gradually began to wane during the 1980s,has two main characteristics. First, “the Hermetic Tradition”(and by implication, Western esotericism generally) is presented"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationas a quasi-autonomous counter-tradition pitted against the main-stream traditions of Christianity and rationality. Second, thepresentation of this Hermetic Tradition is inextricably linked tomodernist narratives of progress by means of science. Yates’grand narrative was based upon an exciting paradox: she claimedthat the “great for ward movement” of the scientific revolution,from which the modern world has emerged, was crucially in-debted not to rational traditions but—of all things—to the her-metic magic epitomized by figures such as Giordano Bruno. Inother words: precisely this forgotten hermetic counterculture ofthe West, long decried as merely superstitious and reactionar y,has supposedly been the true motor of progress.16The two main components of the “Yates Paradigm” have today beenrefuted.17 The ver y notion of a Hermetic Tradition, in the sense of anautonomous and demarcated single tradition, has been abandoned bymodern scholars in favor of a number of traditions, loosely connected.Yates’ arguments for a single tradition were simplistic and did not takeinto account the highly complex nature of cultural phenomena. Further,the idea that the Hermetic Tradition was the impetus of the emergenceof modern science has been discarded, and it is today assumed thatWestern esotericism was merely one among a number of factors thatcontributed to the emergence of modern science—not the only one.In 1992 Antoine Faivre proposed a definition of Western esotericismas a “form of thought,” which consists of four intrinsic and two second-ar y constituting components.18 Faivre’s definition has had a large impacton the academic community, and it has become the standard definitionin works dealing with Western esotericism. According to Faivre, thehistorical scope of Western esotericism covers the period from the Re-naissance at the end of the fifteenth centur y to modern movements oftoday. Geographically, the field is restricted to the Western culturalhemisphere, and there are thus no claims to study a so-called “universalesotericism.”19 The four constituting components are: (1) The idea ofcorrespondence; (2) Living nature; (3) Imagination and mediations;(4)The experience of transmutation; and the secondar y (5) The practiceof the concordance; (6) Transmission.20 This form of thought, expressedin different ways, can be found in a number of traditions from the Re-naissance and onward: hermeticism, Christian Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism,spiritual alchemy, astrology, magic, theosophy, occultism, etc. Differentas all these traditions most certainly are, they share Western esotericismas their common basic form of thought around which their individualtraits and characteristics are centered. It is this common aspect thatgives them a shared air de famille.21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"11Western Esotericism(1)Correspondences. There are symbolic and concrete correspon-dences between all the visible and invisible parts of the universe. Mancorresponds as a microcosm to the universe (macrocosm). The idea ofcorrespondences is vital to the three “royal arts” of Western esotericism;that is, magic, alchemy, and astrology. There are primarily two kinds ofcorrespondences. First, “those that exist in nature, seen and unseen.”22For instance, the seven planets correspond to the seven metals, and theseven metals correspond to specific parts of the human body. The hu-manspiritus corresponds to the spiritus mundi, and so on. Second, “cor-respondences between Nature (the cosmos) or even histor y and re-vealed texts.”23 Scriptures, such as the Bible, are considered to be inharmony with nature, and through careful study of one, greater knowl-edge is reached about the other. This type of correspondence is particu-larly important to the Kabbalah.(2)Living Nature. The entire universe is “complex, plural, hierar-chical.” It is alive and traversed by a network of sympathies or antipa-thies that link the things of nature. The knowledge of this network(usually described as mystical links) enables the magician to manipulateit, and thereby causes results in the natural world according to his will.The manipulation of this network of mystical links, is in fact the core ofRenaissance magic, or magia.(3)Imagination and Mediations. The esotericist regards the imagi-native faculty of man to be of great importance. That which is beingrevealed to his “inner eyes,” or creative imagination, is the material (i.e.,invisible part of the Universe) that interests him. Connected to theimagination or vis imaginativa is the use of rituals, symbolic images,mandalas, and intermediar y spirits. As Couliano has pointed out, magicworks primarily through the imagination.24(4)Experience of Transmutation. Transmutation is a term borrowedfrom alchemy, which signifies the passage from one plane to another,the modification of a subject in its ver y nature. Just as the alchemistsaimed at turning lead into gold through a process that included thestages of nigredo,albedo, and rubedo (sometimes even citrinitas), thisprocess could be viewed as a spiritual one. For the present study, theexperience of transmutation is of great importance, since the idea ofinitiation is partly connected to it. The initiate is often viewed as goingthrough a process of transmutation as he passes through the variousrites of initiation.(5)The Praxis of the Concordance. From the end of the fifteenthcentur y and during the sixteenth centur y an idea of acquiring “a gnosisembracing diverse traditions and melding them in a single crucible”existed. This is exactly how Western esotericism got its form duringthe Renaissance. By taking ideas from Neoplatonism, pythagorism,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationhermeticism, Christian Mysticism, and kabbalah the esoteric form ofthought was formed. Faivre describes the practice of the concordance as“a consistent tendency to tr y to establish common denominators betweentwo different traditions or even more, among all traditions, in the hope ofobtaining an illumination, a gnosis, of superior quality.”25 Connected tothis is the popular idea of the philosophia perennis, which claimed that atradition of mystical knowledge had been handed down from HermesTrismegistus through Moses, Zarathustra, Plato, and many others.(6)Transmission. The esoteric knowledge must be transmitted frommaster to disciple according to set rules. The knowledge that is trans-mitted cannot be questioned, and it is seen as part of a tradition thatmust be respected and regarded as an “organic and integral ensemble.”The importance of this idea for initiation is clear: there must be some-one who initiates the disciple—he cannot initiate himself. This last cri-terion is of vital importance for the masonic initiator y societies.According to Hanegraaff, Faivre’s definition of Western esotericismis problematic as foundation for a disciplinar y paradigm. While Hanegraaffdoes not deny the “heuristic value” of Faivre’s paradigm, “as based upona scholarly construct,” he questions the validity of the definition for post-sixteenth and particularly post-eighteenth-centur y esoteric currents.Hanegraaff argues that Faivre’s definition is based on the esotericism ofthe Renaissance, and that it does not take into account that esotericismchanges through histor y.The problem becomes all the more pressing if one applies thedefinition to post-eighteenth centur y “occultist” currents. PreciselyFaivre’s first—and arguably central—intrinsic characteristic, theworldview of correspondences, was severely compromised, to saythe least, under the impact of a “mechanical” and positivistworldview based on instrumental causality. Obviously this is notto deny that doctrines of “correspondences” may be encounteredin various nineteenth- and twentieth-centur y forms of esotericism.The point is that the disenchantment of the world may cause themeaning of “correspondences” to get thoroughly reinterpreted;one might even go as far as suggesting that at least some nine-teenth- and twentieth-centur y “esoteric” currents reflect a(neo)positivist “form of thought” adorned with some of the trap-pings of pre-Enlightenment esotericism, rather than the reverse.In sum, it seems that Faivre’s paradigm runs the risk of ignoringor minimizing the creative innovations and transformations ofWestern esotericism under the impact of secularization, in favourof a “grand continuity” on phenomenological foundations.26"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"13Western EsotericismHanegraaff’s criticism implies that Faivre’s definition of esotericism asa “form of thought” is static, and that esotericism instead should bestudied as something complex and changeable. It should, however, benoted that Hanegraaff does not seem to contest Faivre’s constitutingcomponents as such, but instead focuses on the interpretation of theirmeaning. According to Hanegraaff, the meaning of the basic compo-nents of esotericism changes due to “disenchantment of the world” andthe secularization of esotericism.In order to understand the finer points of Hanegraaff’s criticism it isnecessar y to be familiar with his idea of how occultist forms of esotericismof the nineteenth and twentieth centur y differ from traditional, or Renais-sance, esotericism. First, the understanding of what the “correspondences”actually consist of changed dramatically due to the impact of scientificmaterialism and nineteenth-centur y positivism. The mechanical and “dis-enchanted” worldviews stood in sharp contrast to the enchanted worldviewof the Renaissance, in which the divine power permeated the micro- andmacrocosmic worlds through the noncausal correspondences.Accordingly, occultism is characterized by hybrid mixtures oftraditional esoteric and modern scientistic-materialist worldviews:while originally the religious belief in a universe brought forthby a personal God was axiomatic for esotericism, eventually thisbelief succumbed partly or completely to popular scientific visionsof a universe answering to impersonal laws of causality.27Second, Hanegraaff stresses the fact that Western esotericism emergedas a “syncretistic type of religiosity in a Christian context, and its repre-sentatives were Christian until far into the eighteenth centur y.” Thedominance of traditional Christianity on esotericism decreased in favorof an influx of eastern religiosity, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism.According to the first nonintrinsic component of Faivre’s definition ofesotericism, the Praxis of the Concordance, the esotericists often saw thevarious established religions as different branches of one and the sametree. This view is especially apparent in nineteenth- and twentieth-centur yoccultist movements. The eastern religiosity that came to influence West-ern esotericism was, however, a Westernized form, as it was in particu-lar through theosophical literature that the general public encounteredit. The interest of the theosophical leaders, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky(1831–1891) and Henr y Steel Olcott (1832–1907), in Buddhism drovethem to visit Ceylon in 1880. This visit can, to a certain extent, be con-sidered as the commencement of the so-called Buddhist revival thatwould spread across Asia around the turn of the twentieth centur y. During"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationhis visit to Ceylon, Olcott founded the Buddhist Theosophical Society“with the aim of preser ving the heritage of Buddhism and spreadingBuddhist education by setting up Buddhist schools.”28 It is noteworthythat many of the early westerners who converted to Buddhism came fromoccultist milieus. For instance, the first European to enter the sangha andbecome an ordained monk was the Englishman Allan Bennett (1872–1923), who took Ananda Metteyya as his ecclesiastical name. Allan Bennetthad been an active member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,and it is often assumed that he was the adopted son of MacGregor Mathers(1854–1918), the chief of the order from around 1895 to its collapse in1900. Prior to his departure for the east, Bennett lived with the occultistAleister Crowley (1875–1947) and trained him in ritual magic.29The most significant impact of Hinduism on Western esotericismcan be attributed to the endeavors of Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902).In 1893 Vivekananda attended the World Parliament of Religions and hiscontribution is of paramount importance for the interpretation of Hindu-ism as a modern teaching of wisdom. Vivekananda preached a form ofneovedanta, which was congenial to the sentiments of the occultist cur-rents. According to Vivekananda, his teachings were of a universal na-ture and not limited to the sects of individual religions.30Third, the impact of the new theories of evolution, and in particularthe philosophical models originating in German Idealism and romanti-cism, became connected to a universal process of spiritual progress. Theidea of a universal spiritual progress became, according to Hanegraaff,fundamental to almost all forms of occultism. This is especially true forNew Age, of which one feature is the belief that mankind is about to entera new age, astrologically termed the Age of Aquarius, characterized by ahigher spiritual development. This spiritual development is often consid-ered to be connected to a monistic form of thought, as opposed to thesupposed dualism of the previous age, the Age of Pisces.31Fourth, the influence of psychology, and in particular the influenceof Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961). Jung’s theor y of the anima and ani-mus, the importance attributed to the unconscious, the process of indi-viduation, and the universally applicable archetypes have all becomestandard features of contemporar y esotericism. Psychological terminol-ogy is often used to explain religious concepts to such an extent that itis valid to speak of a “psychologisation” of the occult.32Finally, the fifth aspect, which Hanegraaff mentions, in which theoccultist movements differ from earlier forms of esotericism, is the impactof capitalist market economy on the domain of spirituality. This aspectis especially prevalent in the New Age movement.33Hanegraaff’s dissatisfaction with Faivre’s definition of Westernesotericism as a form of thought is to be contrasted with his own propo-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"15Western Esotericismsition for a new research paradigm. According to Hanegraaff, Westernesotericism should not be studied as an essentially static worldview, butas something that is continually transformed and that adapts to newcircumstances. His theoretical definition of Western esotericism is basedon the previously mentioned three different ways of achieving knowl-edge: doctrinal faith, rationality, and the “middle way,” which is charac-terized by knowledge, or gnosis, of a revelator y nature:It is indeed hard to deny that an emphasis on gnosis, rather thanon rationality or the reliance on religious authority, is quite typi-cal of the currents and personalities usually considered as fall-ing under the heading of “Western esotericism”; and one mayadd that a marked preference for mythical and symbolic ratherthan logical and discursive language follows naturally from thesepremises. The great risk of such a definition consists in the fre-quent tendency to misunderstand its ideal-typical and heuristicnature, and use it in a reductionist fashion.34 [My emphasis.]Hanegraaff’s theoretical definition of Western esotericism as a strategyof knowledge does not, however, only run the risk of being used in areductionist fashion, but it also runs the risk of being used in such awide manner that it becomes all-inclusive—and consequently useless asan alternative to Faivre’s definition. The nature of the gnosis strived for bythe esotericists needs to be further analyzed. The already-quoted defini-tion of gnosis as “a revelator y experience that mostly entailed an encoun-ter with one’s true self as well with the ground of being, God” is a goodstarting point for a theoretical stance, but it needs to be further elaboratedin order to be used in a satisfactor y way. For instance, is gnosis to be seenas a way of salvation (not forgetting that esotericism is seen as a form ofChristian spirituality)? In what way does gnosis differ from the aim of themystic—or indeed, is there a difference at all? Questions such as theseneed to be addressed before Hanegraaff’s proposal for a new definition ofesotericism can be used with any greater result.35At present, Hanegraaff’s definition does not exclude the use ofFaivre’s definition of esotericism. On the contrar y, the two definitionscan be used as two parallel ways of approaching esoteric discourses.Faivre’s constituting components do not necessarily have the sameimport in the nineteenth centur y as they had in the Renaissance, butthis does not mean that they are not applicable to esoteric currentsafter the Renaissance.Finally, a word or two needs to be said concerning Hanegraaff’svaluable contribution to the understanding of the development ofesotericism under the impact of secularization and modernity. It is, in"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationmy opinion, undeniable that the five above-mentioned changes can betraced in nineteenth- and twentieth-centur y esotericism, but I would alsolike to mention the importance of yet two other significant new aspectsof occultist currents. First, the importance attached to personal religiousexperiences. The pragmatic nature of occultism is evident already in thewritings of Éliphas Lévi (pseudonym of Alphonse Louis Constant, 1810–1875), often considered to be the chief instigator of nineteenth-centur yoccultism. This pragmatism was often directed toward the achievementof various “altered states of consciousness,” for example, by the invoca-tions and evocations of higher beings, angels, or gods. The religious/mystical experiences strived for were often ver y specific in nature: forinstance, in the A\\A\\, an order founded by Aleister Crowley in 1907,the adepts were expected to reach a state that was called “the Knowl-edge of and Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel,” which can bedescribed as a union of the conscious mind with the unconsciousness.The terminology was taken from a medieval manuscript at theBibliothèque de l’Arsenal that MacGregor Mathers had translated andpublished as The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage (1898).Other examples of the importance placed on religious experiences arethe popularity of works on yoga among adherents of occultism, and theuse of sex in magical rituals. The experiential aspect of occultist cur-rents has continued to be an important feature of nineteenth- andtwentieth-centur y occultism, but it is also a significant part of the NewAge movement.The second new important aspect of nineteenth- and twentieth-centur y occultist currents is the importance placed on the personal willof the esotericist. The will is not only seen as a fundamental tool inmagical rituals, it is often seen as a divine or supernatural aspect of man.This latter view is not as prevalent in the writings of early French occult-ists, such as Eliphas Lévi, as compared to later British occultists. But thewill is nonetheless important to Lévi as the prerequisite to attain “magi-cal power”:Two things, as we have already said, are necessar y for the ac-quisition of magical power—the emancipation of the will fromall ser vitude, and its instruction in the art of domination.36The later occultist view of the will as something divine was to a largeextent influenced by modern philosophers, most notably FriedrichNietzsche (1844–1900). Although, for instance, Helena Petrovna Blavatskyand the founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn attributedgreat importance to the will,37 it is with Aleister Crowley that the reli-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"17Western Esotericismgious nature of the will reaches its climax. The new religious movementthat Crowley founded in the first decade of the twentieth centur y, Thelema(Greek for will), has as its basic tenet that all men and women have a“purpose” with their lives—a “True Will.” With the help of “Magick” and“Mysticism,” which were seen by Crowley as the two roads of attain-ment, the adherents of Thelema aim to find out what their True Will is.Crowley summarized the formula of the law of Thelema thus:The formula of this law is: Do what thou wilt. Its moral aspectis simple enough in theor y: Do what thou wilt does not meanDo as you please, although it implies this degree of emancipa-tion, that it is no longer possible to say à priori that a givenaction is “wrong.” Each man has the right—and an absoluteright—to accomplish his True Will.38These two additional features (i.e., the importance attached to personalreligious experiences and the emphasis of the will), in occultist currentsare important in many contemporar y forms of esotericism, such as Wicca,ritual magic and certain forms of Satanism.Western Esotericism in Theor y and PracticeFaivre’s methodological paradigm of Western esotericism as a “form ofthought” is an abstract construct aimed at capturing the essence of awide variety of phenomena. To be sure, the criteria required of a mate-rial in order for it to be classed as esoteric are simple enough. If theconstituting components of Western esotericism, and preferably thesecondar y ones as well, are present in a material, then it is regarded asesoteric. If one, or more, of the constituting components are not to befound, then the material is consequently not regarded as esoteric. Theesoteric discourses are characterized by a highly symbolic language,often accompanied by images and emblems through which esotericismis expressed:The best way to locate any of these six components in a dis-course, a work, a ritual, etc., is not to look for doctrinal tenets,but to tr y to find evidence of their presence in concrete mani-festations like images, symbols, styles, etc.39The complexity of symbols and images found in the esoteric materialrequires that the scholars who endeavor to trace esotericism havea thorough knowledge of the esoteric currents and their particular"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"18Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationsymbolism. In theor y, Faivre’s methodology of Western esotericism is asimple, yet precise, tool where the scholar can identify the form of thoughtin question. In practice, however, I would argue that the identification ofthe esoteric form of thought is not always as simple as one might expect.In fact, the scholar is confronted on numerous occasions with materialthat apparently belongs to the corpus of specific esoteric currents or tra-ditions, such as alchemy, but in which it is impossible to detect some, orall, of the constituting components. Furthermore, as Faivre points out, amaterial is never exclusively esoteric—it is the question, based on a par-ticular methodological approach, posed to the material that to a largeextent direct the subsequent answers.40 That is, depending on what as-pects one chooses to address in a material, different answers will befound. For instance, The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz canbe described as, for example, Rosicrucian, alchemical, mystical, Christian,hermetic, or simply as a joke—depending on what questions we pose tothe text. This fact presents us with a number of problems. For instance,can a Rosicrucian text be nonesoteric? Can a text in which it is impossibleto detect the constituting components of the esoteric form of thought stillbe classified as esoteric? What follows is an attempt to classify four differ-ent types of texts related to Western esotericism.(1)Texts belonging to one (or more) esoteric current(s), in which theconstituting components of the esoteric “form of thought” are explicitly present:This categor y is that which we normally term esoteric; that is,texts in which the constituting components of Western esotericism areclearly present. Thus, esoteric currents such as Christian Kabbalah,paracelsism, Rosicrucianism, theosophy, alchemy, astrology, magic(Magia), occultism and perennialism all have the common feature thatthey are permeated with the esoteric “form of thought,” expressedthrough the constituting components. The esoteric form of thought is toa large extent explicitly present in these currents; that is, the constitut-ing components of Western esotericism are detectable—and therebythese currents answer to the required criteria of designing them asesoteric. Important to note is that the esoteric form of thought is afundamental aspect of these currents, and that their individual traits anddevelopments are in accordance with Western esotericism.(2)Texts belonging to one (or more) esoteric current(s), in which theconstituting components of esoteric form of thought are implicitly present:In the majority of the discourses related to the esoteric traditionsdiscussed above, Faivre’s constituting components of Western esotericismare easily detectable. However, there are a certain amount of texts that"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"19Western Esotericismbelong to one, or more, of the esoteric traditions, in which it is notpossible to trace the constituting components of the esoteric form ofthought. That is, it is not possible to trace any explicit references to thecomponents, but the context and subject of the texts are nonethelesspointing toward the components in an implicit manner. Indeed, evennonesoteric texts can be interpreted as esoteric, depending on the cir-cumstances in which they appear, and how they are used.41 Westernesotericism is, according to Faivre, a form of thought, a certain mannerthrough which the esotericist interprets phenomena. As esoteric mate-rials are composed by esotericists, and more often than not, for otherfellow-esotericists, it is important to take into account the possibility thatthe constituting components of Western esotericism were not alwaysexpressed explicitly as they already played such an integrated part ofthe authors’ and readers’ shared worldview. It is more than likely thatthe fundamental components often were taken for granted, and therewas consequently no need to express them.42 However, by a thoroughstudy of the text it is possible to trace them implicitly. For instance, analchemical recipe might not explicitly refer to the correspondencesbetween the seven metals and the seven planets, but an alchemist wouldnonetheless immediately see the connection, and further, he or she wouldrelate the correspondences to man, as man is the microcosm of macro-cosm.43 This is admittedly an oversimplified example, but it ser ves toillustrate that since the constituting components of Western esotericismare such fundamental features, they must be taken into account eventhough they are not explicitly present. It is the context that determineswhether or not esotericism can be considered to be implicitly present,and not the mere fact that it belongs to an esoteric tradition.44(3)Texts belonging to one (or more) esoteric current(s), in which theesoteric form of thought is not present:There are, however, instances when a text clearly belongs to acertain esoteric current, but in which the esoteric form of thought is notpresent. At first appearance this statement might seem as a contradic-tion. However, a text that is clearly part of an esoteric tradition, such asRosicrucianism, can be dealing with subjects that are not dependent onthe esoteric form of thought.45 In other words, a text can be Rosicrucian,but that does not necessarily make it esoteric. A text can only be termedesoteric when the constituting components are present in it, in an ex-plicit or implicit manner (vide supra). A text dealing with organizationalquestions, such as The Laws of the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross (in whichthe esoteric form of thought is not explicitly present), is not dependenton the esoteric form of thought, and it is therefore possible to rule out"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"20Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationthe presence of esotericism in an implicit manner. The criteria for as-signing a text as esoteric should not be based on the mere account ofit belonging to one or more of the esoteric currents, but to whetheror not the constituting components can be ascertained in an explicit orimplicit manner in it.(4)Migration of esoteric ideas into nonesoteric materials:It is common enough to find symbols, ideas, or techniques thattraditionally are connected to a certain esoteric tradition in nonesotericmaterials. For instance, references to magic or alchemy can frequentlybe found in modern literature, such as the Fantasy genre, in which theesoteric form of thought is not present.46 Magic, for example, can haveeither a seminal or nominal presence in the material, but that does notmake it esoteric, as we understand the term. Another example can befound in the New Age movement in which the eclectic attitude is appar-ent. A person might use techniques that traditionally are connected tothe esoteric traditions, such as Tarot, in a purely divinator y or meditationalmanner without taking into account the underlying esoteric form ofthought. Such practice cannot be termed esoteric, as it is an example ofa nonesoteric usage of a traditionally esoteric technique. These twoexamples illustrate two different ways in which esoteric ideas can mi-grate into nonesoteric areas.All classifications are reductions, and ultimately simplifications, ofcomplex data, and the above classification is no exception. Furthermore,theoretical classifications tend to become awkward instruments whenpractically applied. It is nonetheless important to stress the differentaspects of esotericism in order to understand its various modes of mani-festation. It should be stressed that the notion of implicit esotericismshould be used with caution and only when there are valid reasons forapplying the term. A liberal usage of the term might render it too inclu-sive and thus distancing it from the definition of Western esotericism asunderstood by Faivre. Used with proper reser ve it will, however, ser vethe scholar with a means to draw attention to a hitherto largely ignoredaspect of Western esotericism.Western Esoteric CurrentsCriticism to Frances Yates’s theor y of a so-called Hermetic Traditionshows that there is no such thing as a homogenous hermetic tradition,but rather a number of complex and intertwining hermetic traditions orcurrents.47 In a similar manner it is necessar y to be cautious toward the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"21Western Esotericismnotion of a single esoteric tradition. As already stated, Westernesotericism, as a form of thought, is an abstract construction that onlyexists as a methodology. There is no such thing as an esoteric traditionper se, in which the esoteric form of thought can be traced historically.What we can study, however, are the various currents through whichthe esoteric form of thought manifests itself. The components ofesotericism are traceable through a number of historical currents thathave been present in our cultural hemisphere since the Renaissance.While there is no “Esoteric Tradition” we can, according to Hanegraaff,speak of a so-called “tradition of esotericism”:Certainly, it is on the basis of its ideas that esotericism becomesvisible to the historian as a separate field of study, and it is theirdevelopment over time which enables the historian to speak ofa “tradition” of esotericism.48Thus, when we speak of esoteric currents, it is not the esoteric form ofthought itself that is being referred to, but rather the esoteric form ofthought in its various modes of manifestation.49 Western esotericismis a passive, nonmanifest construct that is traceable only when active, ormanifest in one or more of the esoteric currents; that is, in the empiricaldata available to us.There is not, for us, any esotericism sui generis. Each of thecomponent elements of the form of thought that it has beenagreed to call esoteric presents itself only as a theoretical gen-eralization starting from empirical data (under the circumstances,starting from concrete historical ideas).50The relationship between the “active” and “passive” sides of esotericism;that is, the unmanifest esoteric form of thought on the one hand, and theactive, manifest form of thought as expressed through the esoteric cur-rents on the other, is by definition a one-sided relation only. The esotericform of thought, being static, is not subject to historical conditions (sinceit is an abstract construct), which the esoteric currents on the otherhand by necessity are. The constituting components of Westernesotericism are the same today as they were during the Renaissance—Faivre does not count with additional components as histor y evolves.51The esoteric currents, being nonstatic and dynamic, constantly changeand new currents appear. They show a remarkable tendency to adapt tothe historical conditions of our culture, a fact that is easily detectable inmany of our contemporar y esoteric new religious movements.52"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationThe interrelationship between the esoteric currents shows thatthey are often interpreted by esotericists as dependent, or at least expli-cator y, of each other. This is most evident in occultism in which theeclectic attitude is taken to its extreme. In discussing the use of certainterms connected to Western esotericism Faivre differentiates betweenwhat he calls Currents and Notions, which he further divides into threegroups (Table 1.1).53 According to Faivre the Currents correspond tomovements, schools, or traditions, while the Notions correspond to spiri-tual attitudes or to practices.54The division into currents and notions is important as it stressestwo interconnected dimensions of Western esotericism—the theoretical(or organizational) and the practical (or experiential). The theoreticaldimension, realized in movements, schools, fraternities, organizations,etc., appears to be an important factor in Western esotericism, especiallyfrom the eighteenth centur y onward. The notion that certain societiesor groups of initiates are repositories of a sacred knowledge, or gnosis,is indeed a prominent feature of the esoteric mythology. An importantaspect of esoteric societies as transmitters of gnosis lies in the emphasisof the legitimacy of the “transmutative” knowledge.55 The theoreticaldimension of Western esotericism can be studied from an historicalpoint of view; that is, it is possible to trace a particular school’s develop-ment from its foundation, to ascertain the identity of its founders andmembers, and so on. A further characteristic of the esoteric currents isthat most of them can be traced back to one or more founding texts,whereas the notions are loosely based on a corpus of literature.The practical or experiential dimension of esotericism can be tracedback to classical or Renaissance esotericism, but during the nineteenthcentur y the importance of this dimension is considerably increased. Toa certain extent, the experiential aspect of esotericism can be linked tothe notion of gnosis, the revelator y form of knowledge, which, accord-ing to Hanegraaff, is the prime characteristic of Western esotericism.Table 1.1.

Nevertheless, the division might lead to someconfusion, as it does not provide any clear criteria of where currents endand notions begin. This is apparent in Faivre’s table in which there is agroup that correspond to both notions and currents simultaneously.Especially the relationship between groups 1 and 2 is problematic. Faivreis correct in separating the two groups, as they, from a theoretical pointof view, clearly refer to two different types of terms, or phenomena.However, if we apply Faivre’s classification of terminology to the histori-cal esoteric currents and notions, the division becomes problematic.According to Faivre the notions correspond to spiritual attitudes or topractices, as already mentioned. I would argue that the first group, thatis, Currents, include these as well. There are for instance spiritual atti-tudes and practices connected to the esoteric currents referred to astheosophy, a term that Faivre classifies as belonging to the first group,“Currents which are not notions.”56 There seems to be a discrepancy,then, in this division when applied to the historical “manifestations” ofesotericism—the division is valid but the criteria for the division arequestionable. Nevertheless, Faivre’s classification is, if used with care,of great practical use for the scholar when used on a general level.Western Esoteric Rituals of InitiationThe recent academic interest in Western initiator y societies (often witha focus on Freemasonr y) parallels, to a certain extent, the academicinterest in Western esotericism. In other words, it is a relatively newfield of research, which was previously avoided by the academic com-munity. Freemasonr y was often viewed as a subject not worthy of seri-ous research, partly because a large part of the literature dealing withthe subject did not meet academic standards. This negative view wasaptly described by Yates when discussing the supposed connectionsbetween Rosicrucianism and Freemasonr y:The main reason why serious historical studies on the Rosi-crucian manifestos and their influence have hitherto been on thewhole lacking is no doubt because the whole subject has beenbedevilled by enthusiasts for secret societies. There is a vast lit-erature on Rosicrucianism which assumes the existence of a secretsociety, founded by Christian Rosencreutz, and having a continu-ous existence up to modern times. In the vague and inaccurateworld of so-called ‘occultist’ writing this assumption has produced"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"24Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationa kind of literature which deser vedly sinks below the notice ofthe serious historian. And when, as is often the case, the mistydiscussion of ‘Rosicrucians’ and their histor y becomes involvedwith the masonic myths, the enquirer feels that he is sinkinghelplessly into a bottomless bog.57Fortunately, the situation has improved considerably in the last sevenyears. There are today at least three academic chairs devoted to Free-masonr y,58 and important studies have been published on the subject. Inaddition to this, there exist a number of masonic research organizationsthat maintain a high scholarly standard in their published transactions.59The situation for the scholar has also been improved through a changeof attitude among masonic research societies and libraries toward theacademic community. Scholars are invited to publish articles in renownedmasonic periodicals such as Ars Quatour Coronatorum and Heredom,and to attend conferences open for both masons and nonmasons. Fur-thermore, most masonic libraries are, contrar y to what is often thoughtto be the case, open for nonmasonic scholars.Scholars working in the field of Western esotericism have taken aninterest in initiator y societies, and it is often assumed that esotericismcan be found in this type of society. Yates, for instance, explored therelationship between Rosicrucianism and Freemasonr y, and came to theconclusion that the Rosicrucian furor of the seventeenth centur y prob-ably inspired the founding of “secret societies,” such as Freemasonr y.60Both Faivre and Hanegraaff mention that esotericism can be found inmasonic initiator y societies—especially in the high degrees from thesecond half of the eighteenth centur y.61Faivre begins his short description of eighteenth-centur y initiator ysocieties in Access to Western Esotericism with the words: “It is obviouslythe high degree rites that contain the most esoteric content, thereforeAnglo-Saxon Freemasonr y is less esoteric in character.”62 After a shortdiscussion of the Strict Observance and the Rectified Scottish Rite, Faivremakes a distinction between three types of masonic rites: (1) Christianor Western rites, (2) medieval and chivalric rites, (3) neopagan Egyptianrites.63 Suffice it to say at present that Faivre, while stressing the differ-ence between the Craft degrees and the high or additional degrees,does not state that esotericism is not to be found in the Craft degrees,merely that they contain less esoteric content than the later “High”degree rituals.In discussing the histor y of Western esotericism, Hanegraaff statesthat a Western esoteric tradition known as Christian theosophy, con-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"25Western Esotericismnected to esoteric philosophers such as Jacob Boehme (1575–1624) andFriedrich Christian Oetinger (1702–1782), would later find its way,through German Naturphilosophie, into initiator y societies of the eigh-teenth centur y:Christian Theosophy came to be closely linked to the emer-gence of German Naturphilosophie, including a strong interestin magic and the “occult” phenomena associated with “the Night-Side of Nature.” It flourished, finally, in the so-called Illuministcurrent of the later eighteenth and the early nineteenth centu-ries, partly linked to new initiator y societies modelled upon orconnected with Freemasonr y such as the theurgical Elus Coëns,the Illuminés d’Avignon, the Rectified Scottish Rite, the Orderof the Gold and Rosy Cross and the Asiatic Brethren.64Although both Faivre and Hanegraaff state that Western esotericism isto be found in masonic initiator y societies, they do not venture deeperinto the subject and do not explain how esotericism is actually transmit-ted in this type of society. Furthermore, they do not discuss the ritualsof these societies at all, despite the central position they have for initia-tor y societies. From an academic perspective, the relationship betweenWestern esotericism and rituals of initiation is thus an unexplored fieldof research. In the present work it will be analyzed how Westernesotericism is transmitted through rituals of initiation and, furthermore,what types of esoteric currents or traditions are transmitted. It is hopedthat this will result in a deeper understanding of Western esoteric ritualsof initiation, and thereby assist in bringing this type of ritual from thedarkness of obscurity, to the light of academic scrutiny.Concluding RemarksThe academic study of Western Esotericism is a comparatively new fieldin the histor y of religions, and it is only in the last ten years that the fieldhas received wide academic recognition. There are several reasons forthis belated recognition, but perhaps the most important reason is thatWestern esotericism has been viewed with suspicion, both by theolo-gians and historians of science. Today, the situation has improved con-siderably and scholars from a wide range of disciplines are beginning toview Western esotericism as an important part of Western culture.In this book Western esotericism is approached from a broader(generalist) perspective, which is based on the two research paradigms"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationproposed by Antoine Faivre and Wouter Hanegraaff.

TheLatin word ritus means “custom” and was primarily used in juridical andreligious language. Rituale can be found in the first edition of RitualeRomanum of 1614 where the word implies the prescribed order wherethe religious ser vices of the Catholic Church should be acted out. TheEnglish word “ritual” first appears in the middle of the seventeenthcentur y and the meaning of the word is “the prescribed order of per-forming religious ser vices or the book containing such prescriptions.”The action or behavior prescribed by the ritual was called “ceremony”or “liturgy.” In the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1771),ritual is described as “a book directing the order and manner to beobser ved in celebrating religious ceremonies, and performing divineser vice in a particular church, diocese, order, or the like.” The entr y forRitual was unchanged up to and including the seventh edition of 1852.The following three editions did not include an entr y for ritual. Theeleventh edition of 1910, however, did. This time the entr y, written byR. R. Marett, had swollen to five columns and the word had acquired atotally different meaning. I here quote Asad:[R]itual is now regarded as a type of routine behaviour thatsymbolizes or expresses something and, as such, relates differ-entially to individual consciousness and social organization. Thatis to say, it is no longer a script for regulating practice but a type27"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationof practice that is interpretable as standing for some furtherverbally definable, but tacit event.2The word ritual, from 1852 to 1910, changed from denoting a text, todenotingactionandbehavior, or in the words of Boudewijnse: “It is onlysince the turn of the centur y that anthropologists and historians of re-ligion have started to use ritual as the general term for repetitive, sym-bolic behaviour.”3 The old meaning of the term did not, however, disap-pear from the scene and it can be found in Meyers EnzyclopädischesLexicon from 1977. During the twentieth centur y there have been twodifferent interpretations of the term in existence—and often it is notclear which one of the two meanings of ritual scholars intend whenusing the word. Asad was the first scholar to draw attention to thegeneral changes in the use and meaning of the term “ritual,” but he didnot, according to Boudewijnse, explain when and how the change inscholarly conception had been brought about.Boudewijnse argues that it is the Reformation that draws attentionto the phenomenon of rituals, and more precisely those of the RomanCatholic Church, and that they were valued in a negative manner. In thenineteenth centur y the term is used by Orientalists in order to refer tothe Rig-Veda, etc., and in France the use is even more common whereit is often applied to the ancient Egyptian religion (rituel funéraireégyptien), and to Freemasonr y (rituel maçonnique). In 1871 Edward B.Tylor, in Primitive Culture, divided religious rites in two theoretical di-visions. According to Tylor, religious rites are in part expressive andsymbolic performances, and in part means of intercourse with and influ-ence on spiritual beings. In his Myth, Ritual, and Religion (1877) An-drew Lang was one of the first to use the word ritual when referring toreligious action. In W. Robertson Smith’s influential Lectures on theReligion of the Semites (1889) we find that rite, ritual, and ceremony areused interchangeably but without a clear definition of what the authoractually meant by the terms.4 It is clear however that he is referring toaction and not to texts and, further, that ritual is of primar y importanceto myth: “The conclusion is, that in the study of ancient religions wemust begin, not with myth, but with ritual and traditional usage.”5Throughout the book Robertson Smith stresses the primacy of ritualover myth, and according to him the primar y ritual of Semitic religionsis the sacrifice.So far as myths consist of explanations of ritual their value isaltogether secondar y, and it may be affirmed with confidencethat in almost ever y case the myth was derived from the ritual,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"29Rituals of Initiationand not the ritual from the myth; for the ritual was fixed and themyth variable, the ritual was obligator y and faith in the mythwas at the discretion of the worshipper.But it is of the first importance to realise clearly from theoutset that ritual and practical usage were, strictly speaking, thesum total of ancient religions. Religion in primitive times wasnot a system of belief with practical applications; it was a bodyof fixed traditional practices, to which ever y member of societyconformed as a matter of course.6The last sentence is crucial in understanding Robertson Smith as hewas a pioneer in what later became known as the sociology of religion.Boudewijnse remarks “Robertson Smith took a crucial step. By placingreligious practice in the context of long-term social traditions and dis-connecting it from individual mental states, he connected it to the col-lectivity. As such, religious practice—ritual—became a social fact.” Oneyear later, 1890, saw the publication of the first edition of James G.Frazer’s famous The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion inwhich the word ritual is used constantly. Boudewijnse sums up:[The] use of the term ‘ritual’ seemed inspired by its originalmeaning of a script for behaviour: Because it had the connota-tion of ‘rules’ and ‘prescriptions.’ In short, recognition of theaspect of ‘rules’ as characteristic of ‘religious action’ as a sepa-rate categor y of behaviour, may have instigated adoption of theterm ‘ritual’ to refer to ‘ordered sequences of religious acts,’‘acts based on (a) ritual,’ later to be called ‘ritual acts,’ which,with the passage of time, became ‘ritual.’7The so-called “ritual turn,” which is the process by which the word“ritual” came to denote ritual action instead of text, did, however, notnecessarily mean that ritual (understood as action) became a subject ofscholarly interest. On the contrar y, none of the quoted scholars showedany interest in ritual as symbolic behavior worthy of study in its ownright. The exception to this is Van Gennep in his important book LesRites de Passage (1909), that I will return to later in greater detail. Thestudy of ritual as an important field of research dates from the 1960s andcan be attributed to three important factors: the rise of ethnology; theEnglish translation of Van Gennep’s The Rites of Passage (1960); andthe work of Victor Turner, especially The Ritual Process (1969). Duringthe 1970s the term “ritual” became more and more inclusive and wasnot only concerned with “religious behaviour” anymore. A prime example"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"30Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationof this trend is Secular Ritual, which appeared in 1977.8 CatherineBell comments:[R]itual behaviour. . . now includes high mass in a Greek Ortho-dox church, the swearing in of the president, school graduationceremonies, and the special talismanic actions taken by a pitcheras he gets ready to throw a baseball. This is not to say thatscholars do not see any differences among these rites butsimply that what they share has become a greater theoreticalinterest than what seems to distinguish them—at least for thetime being.9From the 1960s it became apparent for a number of scholars that thereexisted a number of terms related to the phenomenon of “ritual,” butthat their respective meanings were undefined. Some authors tried tomake a distinction between “ritual” and “ceremony” where ceremonycame to be used for secular rather than “religious rituals.”10 This divi-sion, however, proved to be of little use as the division of sacred andprofane came to be heavily criticized, especially during the 1980s.In 1971 Spiro suggested that the term rite should be understood as“the minimum significant unit of ritual behaviour,” and a ceremony as“the smallest configuration of rites constituting a meaningful ritual whole,”and finally a ceremonial as “the total configuration of ceremonies per-formed during any ritual occasion.” In 1987 J.A.M. Snoek proposed yetanother approach, which to a large extent is an elaboration of Spiro’sapproach but which further includes ritual (understood in two differentsenses) and Rite with a capital R, for the total of a cult (such as theRussian Orthodox Rite).11 In 2000 Ronald Grimes suggested that theusage of the word “ritual” should be dropped, and that it instead shouldbe replaced by “rite” for “ritual” in the old sense, and “ritualization” forthe extended scope.12 We can thus discern a number of trends in theusage of the term ritual and related terms such as rite and ceremony.13Rites de PassageWhen searching for “Rituals of Initiation” in the Encyclopaedia Britannica,one only finds a note that states “see Rites de Passage.” In 1909 Arnoldvan Gennep published his book Les Rites de Passage, a work that has hada profound impact on all the later studies of rites of initiation. It is,however, important to stress the fact that Van Gennep did not exclu-sively base his research and subsequent findings on rites of initiation,but rather on various kinds of rites that all tended to ritualize the pass-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"31Rituals of Initiationing from one state of being (or status) into another. Thus, he paid greatattention to the ritualization of pregnancy and childbirth, the reaching ofpuberty, marriage, and death—events that often are referred to as life-crises. But he also discussed recurrent events such as the phases of themoon and the seasonal changes. Earlier research by Heinrich SchurtzAlterklassen und Männerbünde (1902) and Hutton Webster Primitive SecretSocieties (1908) had already divided initiations into two groups—Pubertyrites and initiations into secret societies.14 Van Gennep distinguishedbetween physiological puberty and social puberty and considered thatthe term “puberty rites” should be dropped since they are performed atsocial, rather than physiological puberty.Van Gennep reached the conclusion that all these various types ofrites had a common structural denominator. They all marked the tran-sition from an old state to a new one by a three-phased scheme. First,there occurred a separation from the old social position or state of be-ing. Second, a marginal (or liminal) state in which the candidate foundhimself between the old and the new states. Third, aggregation or incor-poration into the new state. These three phases are composed of ritesof separation, rites of transition, and rites of incorporation, respectively.In his discussion of Van Gennep’s structural theor y concerning rites ofpassage, Max Gluckman has the following to say concerning the empha-sis of the three kinds of rites:Van Gennep stressed that in different situations various of thesethree stages might be emphasized: thus rites of separation areprominent in funerals, while rites of incorporation are markedin weddings, and rites of transition at initiator y ceremonies. Thephase of transition sometimes developes an autonomy of its own,and becomes a “liminal” (threshold) period between two morefirmly established states. This liminal period tends to be ‘sa-cred,’ for he saw social life in early civilizations as constantmovements between ‘the sacred world’ and ‘the profane world.’15However, Gluckman did not read Van Gennep correctly who actuallystated the precise opposite:A première vue, il semblerait que dans les ceremonies funéraires,ce sont les rites de séparation qui doivent prendre la place laplus importante, les rites de marge et d’agrégation par contren’étant que peu développés. Cependent l’étude des faits montrequ’il en est autrement, et qu’au contraire les rites de séparationsont peu nombreux et très simples, que les rites de marge ont"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationune durée et une complexité qui va parfois jusqu’à leur fairereconnaître une sorte d’autonomie, et qu’enfin de tous les ritesfunéraires, ce sont ceux qui agrègent le mort au monde desmorts qui sont le plus élaborés et auxquels on attribuel’importance la plus grande.16The division between the sacred and profane was a ver y popular theor yamong historians of religion; perhaps most explicitly expressed in theworks of Mircea Eliade. However, today the general trend is to view theduality between the sacred and profane with caution, since it is ver yhard, if not impossible, to see any clear-cut borders between the twospheres.17 The problem with Van Gennep lies in the fact that he uses theterm “initiation rites” ambiguously. On the one hand, he uses it explicitlyto refer to puberty rites, on the other hand, he uses it from time to timefor all rites de passage where the object concerned is a person.Victor Turner was highly influenced by Van Gennep’s three-phasetheor y, and paid special attention to the marginal phase (or rather limi-nal phase as he preferred to call it). In the article “Betwixed and Be-tween: The Liminal Period in Rites of Passage” from 1964, and his influ-ential book The Ritual Process from 1969 he expounded his theories oninitiation, but to him the term initiation almost exclusively denoted thepuberty rites and the curative cults of the Ndembu. According to Turner,it is in the liminal phase, when the candidate is “betwixt and between”the old and the new states, that the most decisive event of the initiationoccur. It is in this phase that the officers of the initiation transmit agnosis, or sacred knowledge, to the neophyte. The sacred knowledge issupposed to transform the candidate’s innermost being, to turn him orher into a new being. This sociological and/or psychological change (de-pending on the type of the initiation) is often connected to the idea of a“second birth” or resurrection after a symbolical death. The concept ofdeath in rites of initiation that follow the scheme of the rites de passage,is as a rule a dominant part of the first phase, that is, the separation fromthe old state of being. In the third phase the candidate emerges from therealm of death (i.e., the liminal period) and is incorporated into the newstate. Eliade states that the initiator y death is central for every initiation:The central moment of ever y initiation is represented by theceremony symbolizing the death of the novice and his returnto the fellowship of the living. But he returns to life a newman, assuming another mode of being. Initiator y death signi-fies the end at once of childhood, of ignorance, and of theprofane condition.18"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"33Rituals of InitiationHowever, it is my opinion that Eliade’s statement that “the central mo-ment in ever y initiation is represented by the ceremony symbolizing thedeath of the novice and his return to the fellowship of the living” shouldbe questioned. First, death is not central in every initiation, even thoughit is a common characteristic of rites of initiation that are structured asrites de passage. Second, not all rites of initiation are rites de passage, andvice versa, not all rites de passage are rites of initiation. Third, the use ofa symbolic death in rites of initiation does not necessarily have the samefunction and meaning in all instances where it occurs. For instance, themasonic third-degree initiation of a Master Mason, which includes asymbolical death centered on the legend of Hiram Abiff19, does not fulfillthe same function as the ones aimed at in Australian puberty ceremo-nies, on which Eliade to a large extent based his research.According to Turner the liminality is usually connected to an ab-normal state, which falls outside structured society. It is a state where“normality” is turned upside down. Basing his studies on research doneamong the Ndembu, Turner reached the following conclusion:Thus, liminality is frequently likened to death, to being in thewomb, to invisibility, to darkness, to bisexuality, to the wilder-ness, and to an eclipse of the sun or moon.20The neophytes (i.e., the ones who undergo the initiation) are usuallyacting in a passive or humble manner. They have to obey their instruc-tors, and “accept arbitrar y punishment without complaint.” A furthercharacteristic is that the neophytes tend to “develop an intense comrade-ship and egalitarianism” apart from the ordinar y societal bonds.21 It isinteresting to note why the neophyte, according to Turner, must sepa-rate from the old state of being. It’s simply because the new knowledgethat is being transmitted during the liminal period is viewed as changingthepersona of the candidate, and therefore has to replace the candidate’sformer knowledge.The neophyte in liminality must be a tabula rasa, a blank slate,on which is inscribed the knowledge and wisdom of the group,in those respects that pertain to the new status.22Liminality is not, however, exclusively connected with the second phaseof a rite de passage. The term can also be applied to other phenomena,which in one way or another either fall outside the societal structure, oreven form the basis of an “anti-structure.” Turner enumerates suchdiverse phenomena as “subjugated autochthones, small nations, court"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationjesters, holy mendicants, good Samaritans, millenarian movements,‘dharma bums,’ matrilaterality in patrilineal systems, patrilaterality inmatrilineal systems, and monastic orders.”23 These liminal occurrencesinterested Turner from a sociological perspective:Yet all have this common characteristic: they are persons orprinciples that (1) fall in the interstices of social structure, (2)are on its margins, or (3) occupy its lowest rungs.24According to Turner, the primar y function of these liminal phenomenais to maintain and strengthen the social structure(s) by forming an anti-structure. The liminal persons or principles indirectly set the standardsfor the normal or structured society. That which is not liminal is normal,and therefore part of the structured sphere of society. An importantdistinction among rites de passage, which Turner makes, is that betweenrituals of status elevation and rituals of status reversal. These rituals areclosely connected with two kinds of liminality.(. . .) - first, the liminality that characterizes rituals of status el-evation, in which the ritual subject or novice is being conveyedirreversibly from a lower to a higher position in an institution-alized system of such positions. Secondly, the liminality frequentlyfound in cyclical and calendrical ritual, usually of a collectivekind, in which, at certain culturally defined points in the seasonalcycle, groups or categories of persons who habitually occupy lowstatus positions in the social structure are positively enjoined toexercise ritual authority over their superiors; and they, in theirturn, must accept with good will their ritual degradation. Suchrites may be described as rituals of status reversal.25The first group, rituals of status elevation, is of primar y importance forthe present investigation into the nature of Western esoteric rituals ofinitiation. Turner states that apart from “life crises rites” (i.e., rites con-nected to birth, puberty, marriage, and death), he would like to add “therites that concern entr y into a higher achieved status, whether this bea political office or secret society.”26 Turner further states that theserites can either be individual or collective, but that they usually tend tobe performed for individuals. Comparing this with the Western materialwe find that initiations performed within esoteric orders are exclusivelyindividual, even though some aspects of them might be collective.27 Ritualsof status reversal are mostly connected to either calendarical rites orrites of group crises, and these “almost always refer to large groups andquite often embrace whole societies.”28"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"35Rituals of InitiationRites of InitiationThe word “initiate” derives from the Latin initiare and means “to beginor to originate.” The two most frequent usages of the word are to admitnew members into a society or club and to teach fundamentals of some-thing to someone. The word “initiation” usually means to admit some-one into something. Initiation is thus often used synonymously with riteof initiation.29The scholarly usage of the composite term “rite of initiation,” andits twins ritual and ceremony of initiation, is limited to the act of admit-ting someone into an organization or office. In other words, the problemwe often are faced with of understanding whether rite, ritual, and/orceremony is used to denote action or prescription, does not apply to theusage of rite, ritual, and ceremony of initiation. This derives from thefact that scholars unfortunately tend not to obser ve the difference be-tween the prescription, and the actual performance, of the initiation.Further, the act of admittance can in certain cases be in the form of VanGennep’srite de passage, but does not necessarily have to be so. Again,this has led to some confusion, as it is common to find that rites ofpassage are used as synonymous with rites of initiation.Anthropological studies of rites of initiation shifted from a focus onthe ideas and beliefs of the practitioners, to a focus on social significanceof the religious action. Significantly, this shift of focus coincided with theso-called “ritual turn” discussed above, that is the word ritual denotingaction instead of text. The icon of nineteenth-centur y anthropologicalthinking, James Frazer, claimed in the Golden Bough that initiation is“the central myster y of primitive society.”30 According to Frazer, whohad the evolution theor y firmly rooted in his comparative approach toreligion, society has undergone an evolution from magical, to religious,and finally to scientific thinking—an evolution from primitive to civi-lized, that is, nineteenth-centur y Victorian scientific-positivist thinking.He thought that religious practices such as initiation rites containedmagical elements that had sur vived from the so-called primitive magicalphase of human evolution. In discussing Frazer’s notion of sur vivals, LaFontaine states:He included within his pur view initiation into adult status ofboth boys and girls, which, he argued, was the most archaicform, since it was the most widely distributed, initiation intosecret societies or cults, which he claimed as a later develop-ment, and finally, induction into office in such Ancient Greekcults as the Eleusinian mysteries, from which, he argued, devel-oped first the idea of priesthood, and then divine kingship. The"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationcentral feature which underlay all these apparently differentphenomena was the idea that they all concerned a passionateinterest in, and desire to control, life, death and all the forces ofnature. The development of rites followed from the progres-sively greater understanding of the natural world and showedchanging techniques designed to produce the desired result:the enhanced fertility of people, animals and crops.31The chief methodological error of the evolutionists was the theor y of auniversal social evolution. Societies develop in different ways, depending ona number of different aspects. More importantly in the present context,however, is that the evolutionists actually considered themselves capable ofknowing how “the primitive savage” had been thinking. In other words, itwas considered possible to reconstruct the “primitive” ideas and beliefsunderlying religious practices, such as rites of initiation. Early social an-thropologists, such as Robertson Smith and Durkheim, objected to this,and instead emphasized the importance of the social dimension for under-standing religious practices. According to the social anthropological school,religious beliefs were secondar y to religious practices or actions that wereunderstood as “the means of reviving and strengthening the basic moralprecepts on which social life is founded.”32 However, whether one choseto emphasize religious beliefs or action in understanding religion, theclassification of various types of rites of initiation remained the same. Inthe sixth chapter of his Rites de Passage, Van Gennep discusses five differ-ent types of initiation rites, which closely follows Frazer’s division of ini-tiations into three groups, but in which Van Gennep further divides Frazer’sthird group into a number of subgroups: admission into age groups; ad-mission into secret societies; ordination of a priest or magician; enthroningof a king; consecration of monks, nuns, and sacred prostitutes. He thencontinues to discuss admission into six different social groups: totem groups;fraternities; religious brotherhoods; classes, castes, and professions;Christianity, Islam, and the ancient mysteries; passage from one religionto another.In 1964 the International Association for the Histor y of Religions(IAHR) organized a conference exclusively devoted to the topic of “Ini-tiation,” which illustrates the general interest in this phenomenon notonly among social anthropologists and ethnologists, but also amonghistorians of religion. Although Mircea Eliade was unable to attend theIAHR conference on initiations in 1964, his paper entitled L’Initiation etle monde moderne was included in the publication of the transactions ofthe conference. This paper was printed as the first of a total of twenty-eight contributed papers, and thus had the function of an introduction to"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"37Rituals of Initiationthe academic field of initiations. Eliade divides initiations into three dif-ferent categories, or trois grandes catégories d’initiation. Eliade’s divisionof initiations into three groups is the perhaps most used division, or atleast the one most referenced. The same division is to be found inEliade’sRites and symbols of initiation and in the Encyclopaedia of Reli-gion published in 1987. In the first categor y we find rites that are con-nected to the passing from childhood to adolescence. It is the same typeof rites of initiation that Turner termed “life crises rites,” and accordingto Eliade these rites are always in the form of rites de passage. Thesecond categor y of initiations brings the candidate into a secret (orclosed) society. These initiations are usually made on a voluntar y basis,as opposed to the initiations of the first categor y that almost exclusivelyare an integral part of a society, which leaves little room for personalobjections. Usually the candidates cannot apply for membership of asecret society, but are instead invited to join by the society itself. Thereare various ways of determining whether a person is qualified to join asecret society. For instance, the right to become a member of a DancingSociety, a North American secret society, is hereditar y.33One prime characteristic of secret societies often mentioned is thatthey usually claim to possess some sort of secret knowledge. Sometimesthis knowledge can consist of a deeper understanding of the religion thatis being practiced by the society at large. A common characteristic ofsecret societies is that they often (but not always) are restricted to a singlesex. Eliade expresses his view of secret societies thus:What, in my view, is original and fundamental in the phenom-enon of secret societies is the need for a fuller participation inthe sacred, the desire to live as intensely as possible the sacralitypeculiar to each of the two sexes.34Western esoteric rituals of initiation are firmly connected to the notionof secret, or—more adequately—closed, societies as will presently beshown. An important aspect of Western esoteric rituals of initiation isthat there are two types of rituals connected to initiator y societies. First,the initiation or admission into the closed society per se; that is, a ritualthat makes the candidate “one of us” as opposed to “one of them,” thedemarcation between fraternal brothers and outsiders or profane (lit.outside or before the temple). Second, graded initiations that movethe candidate through a system of degrees within the society. Thesedegrees have ver y little to do with the relationship with the profane, butinstead have a decisive effect on the relationship with fellow initiates. Asthe initiate moves higher up the hierarchy or deeper into the closed"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationcircles, he is expected to partake in more closely guarded secrets. Theeffect on his or her relationship with the members of the closed societywill be connected to the degree he or she holds. In the context of closedsocieties or orders that transmit Western esotericism, the degree-structures are often highly elaborate. The Rite of Memphis for instance,is composed of 90 working and 6 official degrees, amounting to a totalof 96 degrees.The third and final group of initiations that Eliade distinguishes isthat of the Heroic and Shamanic Initiations. According to Eliade theprime characteristic of this group is a psychological state that differsfrom the two preceding groups. The keyword to this state is ecstasy. Theheroic initiation is connected to a martial ordeal that arouses the candi-date to the “fur y of the berserkers.”35 The shamanic initiation is, accord-ing to Eliade, connected to an ecstatic state that must be achieved inorder for the initiate to be recognized as a shaman:There are three ways of becoming a shaman: first, by spontane-ous vocation (the “call” or “election”); second, by hereditar ytransmission of the shamanic profession; and, third, by personal“quest,” or, more rarely, by the will of the clan. But, by whatevermethod he may have been designated, a shaman is recognizedas such only after having received two kinds of instruction. Thefirst is ecstatic (e.g., dreams, visions, trances); the second istraditional (e.g., shamanic techniques, names and functions ofthe spirits, mythology and genealogy of the clan, secret lan-guage). This twofold teaching, imparted by the spirits and theold master shamans, constitutes initiation.36As interesting as the shamanic initiation may be, it is far from the typeof initiation that is to be found in Western esoteric rituals of initiation.All rites of initiation, in one way or another, influence the psychologicalstate of the initiate, but not in the extreme sense as it is expected to bethe case in the shamanic initiation. Neither is there any demand on thecandidate in these initiations to reach an ecstatic state in order to berecognized as being initiated.37 In “Some introductor y remarks on thesignificance of initiation” Bleeker offered a classification of initiationsinto six different categories. The classification will be quoted at lengthsince it differs from Eliade’s classification primarily in the width of hisconcept of initiation:1) the initiation into the tribal community, an initiation in whichall young people, both the boys and usually also the girls, takepart. Initiation means in this case, that the initiated are intro-"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"39Rituals of Initiationduced to the knowledge of the myth and to the rules and thecustoms of the tribe.2) the initiation into certain societies of men or women. Thisceremony is generally celebrated by rites, which have either asymbolic or a realistic character, in which latter case they canconsist of cruel ordeals.3) the initiation into a closed society which possess an esoterictruth, sometimes in the form of a secret doctrine.4) the participation in a type of cult which dramatizes a religioustruth of such a mysterious character that only privileged peopleare allowed to attend to it.5) the initiation into an office, which requires certain personalqualities or extraordinar y knowledge, such as the function ofthe shaman, the king or the prophet.6) the initiation into religious truth, which happens when a manembraces a certain belief or is converted.38Compared to Eliade, Bleeker is including far more under the term ini-tiation. The first, fourth, and sixth groups points to an understanding ofinitiation that goes beyond the three types that Eliade formulated. Grouptwo, three, and five correspond, however, directly with Eliade’s first,second, and third group, respectively. During the 1964 IAHR conferenceon initiation some sort of consensus on the meaning of initiation wasreached, as Bleeker states in the preface to the proceedings:As the meeting progressed, the meaning and implications ofinitiation became gradually clearer until it was generally agreed,though no official conclusions were formulated, that the follow-ing three important aspects should be distinguished:i) The so-called ‘rites de passage’ which sometimes function asrites of initiation.ii) Rites of initiation in the strict sense of the word, i.e., ritesintroducing people into closed religious societies.iii) Initiation in the sense of introduction into the mysteries ofreligion.39"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationThis classification differs from those of Eliade and Bleeker as it focuseson the actual rite of initiation and not on what the initiate is initiated into.There is thus a difference made between a rite de passage and a rite ofinitiation, even though the former can function as the latter.The academic literature dealing with rites of initiation is vast, andcovers a wide spectrum of different types, both geographical and histori-cal. Significantly, though, only two authors have dealt with Western ritesof initiation at any depth—one from a sociological perspective, and theother from an anthropological one. Noel P. Gist’s Secret Societies, pub-lished in 1940, includes, among other things, an analysis of basic themesfound in Western rituals of initiation.40 Jean La Fontaine’s well-knownworkInitiation from 1985, discusses the first three degrees of Freema-sonr y at some length, and compares these to the rites of initiation of theChinese Triad society.41 Despite all the apparent differences in worksdealing with rites of initiation, including Gist and La Fontaine, there isone common feature that stands out—the undisputed connection be-tween rites of initiation and secret societies. But what do scholars meanby the term Secret Society? And furthermore, how does this term relateto Western esoteric rituals of initiation?Secret SocietiesSecret societies—a term that connotes different things to different inter-preters. To some it gives an impression of mysticism, hidden truths, andromantic quests for esoteric knowledge. For others, it suggests some-thing sinister, dangerous, or, indeed, evil. Yet again, to some others theterm simply means childish boy-clubs for men. There is a strong ten-dency among scholars dealing with so-called “Secret Societies” to referto a remarkable variety of phenomena with the term. This tendency, orrather rule, has been present in works dealing with this phenomenonfor more than a centur y. Thus, in the highly influential work byHeckethorn, The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries, originallypublished in 1878, we find such divers phenomena as the mysteries ofancient India, China, Egypt, Greece, the Templars, Rosicrucians, andFreemasons treated as if it were a coherent and identical phenomenon,namely as “Secret Societies.”42 Obviously, one would assume, the idea ofdealing with such a wide range of phenomena under one single headingshould give the scholar a reason to pause, to reflect whether this phe-nomenological approach is sound or indeed reasonable. Is it legitimateto argue that, for instance, the Mafia, the Ku Klux Klan, the Triad soci-eties, the ancient myster y cults, and Freemasonr y constitute one andthe same phenomenon? I would argue that it is not legitimate, that it is"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"41Rituals of Initiationmethodologically inadequate to pull certain phenomena out of their his-torical, geographical, sociological, religious, and psychological (etc.)contexts, and then equate them with a myriad of other phenomena thathave been extracted in a similar manner. By adopting this phenomeno-logical approach one is approaching the phenomena in an overly simplis-tic way, concentrating on apparent external similarities while ignoringdifferences and the deeper aspects.Unfortunate as it may be, this trend is still ver y much in practice,as is evident by examining for instance the standard Encyclopaedia ofReligion. Under the entr y “Secret Societies,” George Weckman men-tions several distinctly different phenomena, such as the MelanesianDukduk society; the Poro society in Sierra Leone; the Mau Mau societyin Kenya; Chinese secret societies such as White Lotus, Dragon Flower,and Big Sword, but also the Boxers; the Triad societies in Hong Kong;Native American groups such as the Kwakiutl; Freemasons; Ku KluxKlan; Rosicrucians; the Mafia; the medieval Knights Templar; the Thugsof India; and finally, the Assassins of Persia.43 Now, all of these differentgroups fall under the same heading, that is, “secret societies,” which canbe interpreted as implicitly meaning that, for instance, the Ku Klux Klanconstitutes basically the same phenomenon as the Rosicrucians.44 Sucha claim needs to be challenged. Even a casual look at the aims of thesetwo groups, of the doctrines they are transmitting, their organizationalstructures, etc., leaves in my opinion no doubt that we are dealing withtwo distinctly different phenomena. What, then, is the raison d’etre ofincluding such a variety of organizations under the notion of secretsocieties? The main argument for doing so is the occurrence of what isoften referred to as a “ritualistic usage of secrecy.” Secrecy is, however,a tricky phenomenon. I will return to this in connection with masonicinitiator y societies.There exists a number of classifications or divisions of secret so-cieties. But, as we will see, these are usually not as reliable as one mighthope. Heckethorn makes an initial demarcation between religious andpolitical secret societies. He then proceeds to make a more detaileddivision into seven groups:1. Religious: such as the Egyptian or Eleusinian Mysteries.2. Militar y: Knights Templars. 3. Judiciar y: Vehmgerichte.4. Scientific: Alchymists. 5. Civil: Freemasons. 6. Political:Carbonari. 7. Anti-Social: Garduna.45This classification is rather arbitrar y. For instance, in order to label the“Alchymists” as “Scientific” one is forced to ignore the spiritual aspect"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationof alchemy. It is also questionable whether there ever existed any orga-nized secret societies of alchemists. Further, labeling Freemasonr y as“Civil” is an extreme simplification of this multifaceted phenomenon. Infact, Freemasonr y can be interpreted in so many different ways that itis almost impossible to find one adequate and representative term bywhich all the various aspects are included. There are religious, moral,mystic, esoteric, “civil,” etc., aspects of Freemasonr y.As mentioned, in 1940 the University of Missouri published animportant study that has a direct bearing on the present subject. It is asociological study of secret societies or fraternalism in the United Statesby Noel P. Gist.46 At the outset Gist limits the scope of the work bydefining his use of the term “secret society”:For the purpose of this investigation a secret society may bedefined as any social grouping not based on blood relationshipwhich possesses some ritualistic element of secrecy, the knowl-edge of which is confined to initiated members.47The key notion of Gist’s definition is, thus, the ritualistic element ofsecrecy. We shall return to secrecy in due course. According to Gist, itis possible to discern a functional division between different groups thatmake use of ritualistic secrecy. All in all, thirteen categories are enumer-ated by Gist, but he emphasizes that there are no clear-cut bordersbetween these categories, and that several of the societies can be as-signed to two or more of the following categories.1) Benevolent and philanthropic societies; 2) Insurance societies;3) Revolutionar y and reformist societies; 4) Patriotic societies;5) Professional and occupational societies; 6) Religious orders;7) Mystical and occult societies; 8) Militar y societies and ordersof knighthood; 9) College “social” and recreational societies;10) Honor societies; 11) Abstinence societies; 12) Convivialsocieties; 13) Criminal societies48The categor y of foremost interest for the present study of Western eso-teric rituals of initiation is the seventh, or “Mystical and occult societ-ies.” To this categor y Gist counts Rosicrucian orders and the EsotericSection of the Theosophical Society. Other orders that outwardly, that is,by their names, warrant classification into this group, but which in theiressence are rather conventional and whose elements of mysticism oroccultism may be limited to their names only, include: the Ancient ArabicOrder of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, the Mystic Order of the Veiled Proph-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"43Rituals of Initiationets of the Enchanted Realm, the Mystic Nobles of Granada, and the Mys-terious Order of the Witches of Salem. It is important to note that Gistdoes not consider for instance the masonic Ancient and Accepted ScottishRite as a mystical society, even though their eighteenth degree is relatedto Rosicrucianism, which Gist apparently considers to belong to themystical societies.49 While discussing the categor y of Mystical and OccultSocieties, Gist makes the following remark:While secret in the sense that they withhold portions of theirteachings and rituals from those excluded from their portals,these societies appear to differ both in structure and functionfrom the common types of secret orders: their rituals, theirsymbols, their doctrines, and their objectives place them on theperipher y of the world of secrecy rather than definitely withinits sphere.50This is a statement that needs to be questioned. Many so-calledRosicrucian orders that Gist include in the categor y of Mystical andOccult Societies do not differ in their structure from other Westerninitiator y systems, particularly not when we look at the structure oftheir rituals of initiation (for instance, Der Orden des Gold- undRosenkreuzes of the eighteenth centur y, The Societas Rosicruciana InAnglia, and the inner Order of the Golden Dawn, the R.R. et A.C.).The basic criterion of secret societies as viewed by Gist, that is, theritualistic use of secrecy, contains the important aspect of dealing withsomething in a ritualistic manner. Treating secrecy ritually is apparentlydifferent from ordinar y or profane use of secrecy since it tends to implysome sort of spiritual dimension of secrecy. However, in the alreadymentionedEncyclopaedia of Religion, the secrecy of secret societies tendsto be regarded as strictly profane:The term secret society can be used to describe all groups whosemembership or ver y existence is unknown to nonmembers orthat keep certain of their practices or conceptions hidden fromnonmembers no matter how public or recognized they are asa group.51This definition is highly problematic when we tr y to apply it to masonicsocieties. First, membership in masonic initiator y societies is far fromalways held secret. Second, the idea of keeping certain practices orconceptions hidden from nonmembers is really an all too common prac-tice to be considered as pertaining exclusively to “secret societies.” For"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"44Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationinstance, tactics within a soccer team are rarely disclosed to outsiders;this does, however, not mean that Liverpool FC is a secret society.However, Weckman further discusses five “distinguishing features” of areligious secret society. First, the secret society is a “voluntar y or selec-tive group within a natural community.” This implies that it is up to thesociety whether or not a person will be allowed to join. Second is theidea of secrecy, which, however, does not have to include the existenceof the society, nor its membership. Instead, the secrecy may pertain totheir “activities, rituals, texts, doctrines, myths, and offices.” The thirdmajor feature is the practice of initiation. Related to initiation is thefourth characteristic, the hierarchical structure of the society. The fifthand last point is the occurrence of a certain myth concerning the originsof the society that is “central to its self-consciousness.” These five dis-tinguishing features are to be found in all of the initiator y societieswhose rituals of initiation are analyzed in this book.52Secrecy and Masonic Initiator y SocietiesFreemasonr y is often regarded as a prime example of a secret society,but many contemporar y masonic writers question this.53 Instead, theyoften describe masonr y as a society with secrets in order to emphasizethat masonr y is not an anti-social movement. More than a few scholarshave experienced difficulties in getting access to certain masonic librar-ies and archives, but it should be stressed that the mere strict privacyof a society, be it masonic or other wise, does not by definition make ita secret society.54 It is the ritualistic usage of secrecy that is of interestto us in the present discussion.Nowadays it is fashionable among Freemasons to claim thatFreemasonr y is not a secret society. Clearly, that attitude resultsfrom the desire to clear Freemasonr y of undeser ved blamesthat it would conceal anti-social activities. However, it also be-trays that most Freemasons are not aware that the term “secretsociety” is not only used for groups that tr y to hide their exist-ence, or of which the members tr y to hide their membership,but also for groups which guard a secret. And in that last re-spect, Freemasonr y is a secret society.55Snoek highlights the fact that the notion of secret societies often impliessomething negative in the public mind, and that masons therefore oftenfind themselves in a defensive position in which they seek to distancemasonr y from the popular conception of a secret society. However,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"45Rituals of Initiationmasonic apologetics, anti-masonic polemics, as well as authors writingfor a popular audience rarely take into account how secrecy is actuallyused, and why it is used the way that it is. Furthermore, the use ofsecrecy is not limited to secret societies.Bolle has argued that a central secret, or mysterium magnum, iscentral to any religion.56 This central secret is, according to Bolle, the ver yinnermost core of a specific religion, and Bolle attaches “significance tothe fact that mystics present us with the most detailed formulations whenit comes to the central myster y of religions.”57 In my opinion, it is ques-tionable whether the central myster y of religion (presuming there is onlya myster y and not a number of mysteries) constitutes a secret in thenormal sense of the word—that is, knowledge of some sort, held by agroup of persons, that is not communicated to the public at large. How-ever, supposing that there is such a thing as a central secret to religion,the obvious question is what this secret actually encompasses.Any religion—and not only the ones known as myster y reli-gions—has its central secret, its mysterium magnum. And assoon as we say this, we have to check ourselves once more andremember that the privacy of a group and the myster y of areligion are not the same. When a religion reveals its secret,that secret is not one among many. It is the secret.58We are, in other words, not dealing with a socially based secrecy, suchas the privacy of a group. Rather, thesecret appears to be a specific kindof knowledge connected to the raison d’etre of the religion itself. In otherwords, the secret that Bolle discusses is the equivalent of such notionsas the essence of a religion, or the truth of a religion. Any sensible his-torian of religion would hesitate to venture into these topics as theyconstitute notorious minefields, better left for the philosopher of religionor the theologian to tackle. Nevertheless, secrets are fundamental as-pects of religions, (but perhaps not in the sense of Bolle’s central se-cret), just as secrets are fundamental aspects of human society at large.The restriction of knowledge is one aspect where power (understood inits social capacity) is maintained, and consequently an important aspectof the structure of society. In religion, secrecy is present in variousways. Significantly, it is in mystical traditions that secrecy is used mostextensively. Mystic traditions ranging from the Hindu and Buddhistguarded Tantric texts, the supposed secret teachings of Sakyamuni, thepoetr y of the Sufis, to the teachings of kabbalists and Christian mysticsall have in common that their doctrines are restricted to initiates, and thattheir discourses are veiled in a symbolic language, which for uninitiated"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationis often difficult to fully comprehend. In the gnosticism of late antiquitythe ver y notion of gnosis itself was regarded as a closely guarded secret.In Western esotericism secrecy is used on different levels, as itwere. According to Faivre, it is possible to discern three different wayswhere secrecy is employed in esoteric discourses.59 The first group ofesoteric texts “seem to be designed to mean something other than whatthey appear to mean at face value,” and the author of such texts “seemsdesirous to give the impression that he conceals while revealing andreveals while concealing.”60 The dialectical interplay between conceal-ment and unveiling forms an important aspect of Western esoteric ritu-als of initiation as well, where each degree often points toward a furthersecret for the initiate to penetrate. This is paralleled by esoteric dis-courses in which the reader is confronted by numerous references toother texts:Even so, the person who makes the effort to read all (or, rather,as many as possible) of the texts hinted at, finds himself never-theless confronted by a circular discourse made of images andsymbols, a veil, as it were. It is as if that veil constituted themessage itself. The circularity or paradox is that the text sayscountless things and, at the same time, says one main thing towhich we readers are not privy.61This can be compared with the so-called allusive method, which, accord-ing to Snoek, is an intrinsic part of Freemasonr y. The allusive methodmeans that a ritual, for instance, always has more than one meaning, butit is only the persons who are initiated that know which other meaningsthat are definitely intended as well. Or in the words of Snoek:The allusive method always refers to more than one layer ofmeaning. There are not only the primar y meaning of the phraseused, and the immediate allusive meaning, but, for someonewho is amenable to it, at least one extra meaning is added be-cause the text quoted refers to another text, either from thesame, or from another book within the referential corpus.62The idea that the veil constitutes the message itself is, in my opinion, ofutmost importance to the understanding of Western esoteric rituals ofinitiation. A further aspect of this is that the understanding of the ritualschanges as the candidates advance through the degrees. In this context,however, it is not so much the ritual itself as the experience of it that"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"47Rituals of Initiationconstitutes the message.63 It is the experience of the ritual that consti-tutes the message—or perhaps more adequately, the experience andinterpretation of the ritual is the esoteric message. It is often claimedthat the secrets of Freemasonr y and similar orders are noncommuni-cable, despite the fact that the rituals themselves have been revealed tothe public. In other words, the purpose of the secrecy is not so much amatter of keeping the rituals secret as to keep that which is noncommu-nicable secret. This conclusion is strengthened by Faivre’s second cat-egor y of esoteric discourses’ usage of secrecy, that is, cases where thesecret of a text is the noncommunication of something that is not trans-missible. Or, in Faivre’s words:Esoteric transmission cannot, so it seems, unveil secrets. Rather,it is the noncommunication of what is not transmissible thatconstitutes the secret.64Ergo, the secret of a Western esoteric ritual of initiation is the experi-ence of undergoing the ritual—an experience that by definition is non-communicable. The experience of undergoing a ritual of initiation istantamount to that of a mystical experience, and one characteristic ofmystical experience is the difficulty in expressing and describingit verbally. Snoek has commented on the masonic secret:The secret concerned, however, is nothing unethical, but justthe experience of going through the ritual of the first degree,which turns one into an Entered Apprentice Freemason. Likeany other experience, this cannot be communicated to someoneelse in any other way than letting that person go through it aswell, which will turn him automatically into a Freemason too.So, this is the kind of secret which cannot be divulged.65Furthermore, previous scholars such as Eliade have stated that a rite ofinitiation is supposed to change the innermost nature of the initiate andthereby make him or her a new person. In my opinion this is also thecase in Western esoteric rituals of initiation, but it is not so much theexperience as the interpretation of it that has a transmutative effect uponthe initiate. Esoteric discourses, and I suggest that this includes esotericrituals of initiation as well, are essentially interpretative.66 It is throughan act of interpretation of the experience of the ritual, and the ritual assuch, that the ritual of initiation becomes an initiation in the strict senseof the word. The interaction of experience and interpretation is essential"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationto the understanding of rituals of initiation. Without the experience thereis nothing but meaningless symbols for the esotericist to interpret, andwithout the interpretation the experience fails to become initiatic.The third and last way where secrecy is used in esoteric discourses,according to Faivre, is a more or less systematic “desoccultation of theoccult.”67 In the context of esoteric rituals of initiation, the unveiling ofexplicitly transmissible secrets can be divided into three different sorts.First, the actual ritual of initiation itself. When studying early masonicexposures from the eighteenth centur y it is clear that it is the ritualsthat are considered to be the masons’ prime secret. Second, the “tradi-tional secrets,” which are communicated during the ritual. These consistof the words, tokens, and grips, steps, and some standardized questionsand answers.68 The main object of the “traditional secrets” is to allowFreemasons to recognize each other. Third, certain legends and teach-ings connected to each degree, such as the masonic legend of Hiram,which is to be found in the Master Mason degree as well as in a numberof additional degrees. The nature of these legends and teachings var yfrom ritual to ritual, but generally it can be said that they form themythological setting of the ritual.One final word needs to be said concerning secrecy in the senseof privacy of a group. In each and ever y masonic ritual of initiation theinitiates take solemn oaths of never divulging what has happened duringthe initiation, and sometimes the ver y existence of the society is to bekept secret. At certain historical periods such oaths were unquestion-ably of utmost importance since masonic societies were persecuted bythe authorities. For the most part, especially today, this type of secrecyis not necessar y since there is ver y little persecution conducted againstmasonr y, but the oaths are still used in the rituals. Today, this can beconsidered as, to use Snoek’s words, “part of the elegant game whichFreemasonr y is,” just as the “traditional secrets” are.69Is masonr y a secret society? The obvious answer to that questionis: yes. However, as we have seen, secrecy plays a dominant role inesoteric discourses in general, and the noncommunicable experience ofundergoing a ritual of initiation is universal. In other words, Westernesoteric rituals of initiation are intrinsically connected to secrecy, but toa secrecy that ultimately is dependent on the individual initiate’s per-sonal experience and interpretation of the ritual. Secrecy is part of ever yinitiation in the sense that it is only by undergoing the initiation that onewill take part in it. But it must be understood that secrecy is part of theinitiation, and not vice versa. Initiation is the prime characteristic ofmasonr y—not secrecy. Therefore, I am of the opinion that it is moreadequate to speak of Masonic initiatory societies as this captures whatthese societies are all about—initiations."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"49Rituals of InitiationMasonic Initiator y SocietiesThroughout this book Masonic Initiator y Societies refer to societieswhose activities and structure are centered on rituals of initiation of aver y specific type, referred to as masonic rituals of initiation. The word“masonic” is in this context not interpreted in its restricted, or legal,sense as referring exclusively to the society of Freemasons that offi-cially was founded in 1717. Rather, it refers to a certain type of ritualsoriginating from Freemasonr y, but not necessarily having any links toan official masonic organization.During the seventeenth centur y various masonic lodges existingthroughout the British Isles used specific rituals in order to admit newmembers, but also to differentiate between newcomers and more expe-rienced members within the lodges. In chapter 4 the development ofthese rituals to a tri-gradal system, from the end of the seventeenthcentur y to around 1730, will be analyzed. Chapter 5 deals with the de-velopment of so-called high, or additional, degrees that sprang from theoriginal three Craft degrees. Most of these rituals were restricted toFreemasons, but there gradually appeared more and more orders thathad no formal links to Freemasonr y whatsoever, even though they usedrituals originating from Freemasonr y, either directly or indirectly. Oneof the most influential of such orders during the latter part of the nine-teenth centur y was the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, whose ritu-als are analyzed in chapter 6. During the twentieth centur y Westernesoteric rituals of initiation have been practiced in an unprecedentednumber, and many of the practitioners are probably unaware ofthe masonic origin of their rituals. An illustrative example of this are theWicca rituals created by Gerald Gardner in the 1950s, which are ana-lyzed in chapter 7. Today, Wicca is one of the fastest growing new re-ligious movements in the Western culture.Masonic initiator y societies have been part of the Western cul-ture for more than three centuries, but it is difficult to ascertain whatfunction these societies have had, and continue to have, in the societyat large. From a sociological perspective it is tempting to interpretthese societies with Turner’s concept of communitas. According toTurner, communitas is generated by liminality in society, and is con-trasted to social-structural relationships. It forms anti-structures withinthe social structure of society at large, and thereby ser ves to maintainthe societal structure. Communitas is characterized as being undiffer-entiated, equalitarian, direct, and nonrational, but tending to developstructures of its own. Although masonic initiator y societies often pro-mulgate such equalitarian notions as a universal brotherhood, they areat the same time highly hierarchical in their structure. Furthermore,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"50Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationwhile certain masonic societies had an anti-social agenda, most masonicsocieties can be characterized as being conser vative in their view ofsocietal changes. In fact, all attempts to reach an overall definition ofthe function of masonic initiator y societies are bound to fail becausethere is a wide variety of different types of masonic initiator y societies.Each society must be analyzed individually, and placed in its properhistorical context. Moreover, one and the same society may answerdifferent needs of different members.Masonic Rituals of InitiationIt is important to stress the fact that practically no studies of rituals ofinitiation make any references to masonic rituals of initiation, even lessattempt to analyze this particular body of rituals. One may ask what hascaused this apparent lack of interest from a scholarly perspective. Thereason can by no means be due to a lack of sources as there are literallythousands of manuscripts of masonic rituals of initiation in public andprivate libraries throughout the world. Printed books and periodicals onthe subject of masonr y run in the tens of thousands, many of whichcontain reliable reprints of rituals, and literally millions of both men andwomen have been initiated into one form or an other of Freemasonr ysince the early eighteenth centur y. There is, however, a growing bodyof literature that deals exclusively with masonic rituals of initiation, butunfortunately this literature often fails to reach a broader academic at-tention. This specialized type of literature deals to a large extent withthe development of masonic rituals, such as the development of theCraft degrees of Freemasonr y.When studying masonic rituals of initiation it might be useful totr y to define what the basic components are of this particular form ofritual. The structure of most masonic rituals of initiation closely followsthat found in the three Craft degrees of Freemasonr y, and this structurecan be divided into a number of basic “building blocks” (Table 2.1).These building blocks do not necessarily always follow in the sameorder, nor are they always present in a masonic ritual of initiation. Nev-ertheless, these building blocks more often than not form the basiccomponents of masonic rituals of initiation, and they can thus been seenas the skeleton of the rituals to which is added the particular symbols,mythology, and ritual aspects of each individual ritual. Depending on theparticular rituals, some of these additions are extremely elaborate, whileothers are less complex."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"51Rituals of InitiationTable 2.1.

(c. 1710), and it is later to be found inexposures such as The Grand Mystery Laid Open (1726),The Mystery ofFreemasonry (1730), and Masonry Dissected (1730). Although not ascommon in French exposures, the term is nonetheless to be found inexposures such as La Réception Mystérieuse (1738) and Le Secret desFranc-Maçons (1742). The term “to enter” (in its variants “entr y” and“enter’d”) is to be found in The Dumfries No. 4 MS. and A Mason’sExamination (1723). The expression to be “made a Mason” is to befound, for instance, in The Mystery of Freemasonry. The later Frenchusage of the term “reception” is to be found in most French exposuresof the period, such as Réception d’un Frey-Maçon (1737), La RéceptionMystérieuse, Le Secret des Franc-Maçons (1742–44),andLe Catéchismedes Francs-Maçons (1744).The first usage of the term “ceremony” in reference to masonicrituals in an exposure is to be found in A Mason’s Examination, and it"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"52Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationis then frequently to be found in later English exposures, such as AMason’s Confession (? 1727) and A Defence of Masonry (1730–1731).

In French exposures the term “ceremony” is used almost asfrequently as “reception,” and it is thus to be found in exposures suchasLa Réception Mystérieuse,Le Secret des Franc-Maçons, Le Catéchismedes Francs-Maçons,Le Parfait Maçon (1744), and L’Ordre des Franc-Maçons Trahi (1745).Significantly enough, the first instance of the word “initiation” is tobe found as late as 1730, in the two exposures The Mystery of Freema-sonry (“initiated”) and Prichard’s Masonry Dissected (“initiated” and “un-initiated”), which might be a reference to the fact that the Master Masondegree had by now been fully developed. In French exposures “initia-tion” is used repeatedly from 1738 (La Réception Mystérieuse) onward,and masons are referred to as “initiates” from at least the same year.70Concluding RemarksThe study of rites and rituals has been part of the academic study ofhistor y of religions and anthropology since the latter part of the nine-teenth centur y. It emerges from the literature of these academic disci-plines that rites are an important aspect of human behavior. In this bookI have chosen to use the word ritual as I am analyzing ritual texts—I amnot conducting any obser vations of live masonic rites of initiation in asystematic manner. Neither am I basing my research on in-depth inter-views with practitioners of this type of rite of initiation. When referringto the actual ritual performance of the initiation I have decided to use theword rite, while the word ritual refers to written scripts.The present study is devoted to a hitherto neglected form of ritualof initiation that I have chosen to term Masonic Rituals of Initiation.These rituals are to be found within a specific type of organization ofWestern origin that I call Masonic Initiator y Societies. In chapter 4 I willanalyze the role model, as it were, of all Masonic Rituals of Initiation—the Craft degrees of Freemasonr y."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Chapter 3Historical BackgroundAncient and Medieval SourcesWestern esotericism does not refer to a phenomenon that suddenly ap-peared at the end of the fifteenth centur y without historical roots orbackground. It is an amalgam of various religious and philosophical com-ponents reaching back into the Hellenistic world, if not even further back.The most important components were born in the syncretistic milieuaround the Mediterranean during the centuries before and after AD. ThePlatonic and Pythagorean philosophies are two early important influenceson Western esotericism, but also the various forms of gnosticism withits emphasis on gnosis, the sacred knowledge that could bring salvationfor the gnostic, were important sources of inspiration. During the Re-naissance the rediscover y of the Corpus Hermeticum brought yet an-other source of inspiration, along with the Jewish mystical system of thekabbalah. Perhaps the most important Neoplatonic philosopher who influ-enced early esotericism during the Middle Ages was Denys the Aeropagitewith his theor y of a hierarchy of angels and of the universe. TheAeropagite’s worldview continued to be important during the Renaissance,especially for the angelic (or demonic) magic of Pico and Agrippa.Although the importance of astrology and alchemy declined duringthe Middle Ages, these “sciences” did not completely disappear from thescene. There were relatively few practitioners during this period becausefew texts were available. In the twelfth centur y, however, a new interestin alchemy and astrology followed the translations that began to appearfrom the Arabic. Robert of Chester translated into Latin the first alchemi-cal treatise that became accessible to Europeans.1 Soon many other trans-lations followed, which triggered a great interest in these sciences.Magic during the Middle Ages consisted primarily of so-calledpopular magic, which in some instances contained practices and beliefs53"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"54Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationfrom “pagan” cultures, such as the Norse and the Irish.2 The most popu-lar form of magic though, was the conjuring of spirits, or necromancy.According to Kieckhefer, the aims of the necromancers fall into threemain categories. First, they tried to affect other people’s minds andwills. This took the form of driving somebody mad, or causing him orher to fall madly in love. Second, to cause illusions. Examples of illu-sions are the illusor y raising of the dead, or the conjuring of an extrava-gant feast. Third, the necromancer sought to discern secret things,whether of the past, present, or future. Finding lost or stolen property,to identify the identity of a thief are some examples of this last categor y.3The necromancy of the Middle Ages was ver y pragmatic in nature, andits textbooks were full of instructions for such diverse aims as “arousinga woman’s love,” “obtaining a castle,” and “invisibility.” The necromancerwould use demons and spirits with names such as Astaroth, Sathan, Diles,Gana, and Zelantes in their magical conjurations.4 These demonic namesstood in sharp contrast to Ficino’s natural magic in the Renaissance.The “New Platonic Academy” of FlorenceIn the second half of the fifteenth centur y there gathered around theRenaissance philosopher Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) a group of learnedmen that eventually became known as the “New Platonic Academy” atFlorence, supposedly founded in 1462.5 It was in the intellectual milieuaround Ficino and his followers that Western esotericism, as it is viewedtoday, emerged from the various sources of late antiquity and the MiddleAges. Christian mysticism, Neoplatonism, ancient and medieval magic,gnosticism, and Jewish Kabbalah merged together with the hermetismof the Corpus Hermeticum. The importance of hermetism for Westernesotericism has been pointed out primarily by the works of Walker andYates. The Corpus Hermeticum, which Ficino translated into Latin in1471, was regarded to have the mythical Hermes Trismegistus as itsauthor. For about two hundred years the Corpus Hermeticum was con-sidered as an ancient text, and Hermes Trismegistus the contemporar yof Moses. However, in 1614 Isaac Casaubon (1559–1614), a Protestantfrom Geneva who lived in England, proved that the Corpus was of amuch later date, namely from the first centuries of our era.6For Ficino the so-called hermetic tradition was closely connectedwith the practice of magic, and as the hermetic philosophy began tospread over Renaissance Europe, a revival of magic followed in its foot-steps. According to Yates the magic of the Renaissance was more so-phisticated, philosophic, and artistic. The barbarous names and demonicentities that were invoked and conjured during the Middle Ages sharply"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"55Historical Backgroundcontrasted to the natural magic of Ficino. For Ficino the universe wasmade up of mystical links, or correspondences, that continuously inter-acted. The seven planets influenced the sublunar y world with theirqualities through the mystical links. The fundamental point in Ficino’smagic was that the magician, with knowledge of these mystical links,could manipulate them, and thus cause results according to his will. Forinstance, the malignant influence of Saturn was considered to causemelancholy, and to avoid this Ficino would seek to attract the influencefrom a positive planet, such as Venus. In order to do this he wouldsurround himself with objects that were related to Venus through themystical links. These objects could be natural things such as preciousstones, herbs, or animals. They could also be man-made: a painting ora poem that was inspired by Venus was considered as linked to thatplanet and would accordingly help to diminish the influence of Saturn.Eating food related to Venus, such as white sugar and the white of egg,also greatly assisted the magician in his effort to reach his goal.7 Theuse of talismans as a means to attract the influence of planets was viewedas a highly powerful aid, but also a ver y dangerous one, since the Churchcondemned its use. Ficino was careful in advising the use of talismans,but, as Yates pointed out, he did discuss talismans in his work De vitacoelitus comparanda.According to Walker, the magic of Ficino used the human spiritusas its medium through which it worked. The spirit was the link betweenbody and soul, and the human functions of sense-perception, imagina-tion, and motor activity were connected to the spiritus. The human spiri-tus was made up of the four elements, and it formed a corporeal vaporthat flowed from the brain, where it had its center, through the ner voussystem. Furthermore, the human spirit was connected to the spiritusmundi, which mostly consisted of the fifth element—quinta essentia orether. Ficino considered music as especially connected to the humanspiritus, since it used the same element as its medium—air. But moreimportant than that, the sound consisted of movements where visionar yimpressions merely transmitted static images. These two reasons causedsound to affect the spirit more effectively than sight, and since it is inthespiritus that magic works, sounds were considered more potent thanvisual impressions. What the magician saw or felt was thus secondar yto what he heard.Ficino used music in his magical workings. He composed hymnsor put music to such texts as the Orphic Hymns,8 which he then used asa prominent part of his magical operations. However, Ficino’s theor y ofmusic won just a few followers among his contemporar y musical theo-rists, probably due to the magical aspect of his theor y.

The two chief sourceswere the Christian Mass, and several Neoplatonic texts.10 Other impor-tant sources of inspiration, especially with regard to talismans, weresuch medieval handbooks on magic (often called grimoires), as thewritings of Alkindi, Avicenna, Roger Bacon, and the Picatrix. For Ficinoit was important to maintain that he did not use demons or otherentities in his magic. His magic was natural; that is, he restricted hismanipulations to the planetar y correspondences in nature. He soughtthe influences of impersonal planetar y spirits on the spirit and body(not aiming higher: at the rational soul)—and he was content withthat, or so he claimed. These impersonal planetar y spirits workedthrough the Spiritus Mundi to affect the human spiritus. The greatdifference between these impersonal spirits and demons was that theywere not supposed to possess a soul (as opposed to the demons), andtherefore they could not act directly on man’s rational soul (which thedemons could do).One of those who had gathered round Marsilio Ficino in Florence,was the young Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494). Pico washighly influenced by the learned Ficino and his magic, but he carriedmagic further than Ficino had dared. He denied Ficino’s thesis thatcertain sublunar y objects were more influenced by the planetar y quali-ties than others and claimed that the celestial influences were of a uni-versal nature that affected the whole sublunar y world on an equal basis.It was useless to use certain objects such as stones or herbs to tr y toinfluence one’s spirit. What Pico ventured to do was exactly what Ficinohad avoided, namely, to use demons in his magical operations. Picoclaimed, however, to be in possession of a powerful protection in thisdangerous form of magic—kabbalah. As one of the first Christians touse the Jewish mystical tradition of kabbalah, Pico introduced it to West-ern esotericism where it has since held a prominent position.11 Basicallykabbalah views the universe as composed of ten spheres or Sephirotharranged in a diagram called the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life is themanifestation of God out of the negative existence. By a mystical ascentthrough the Sephiroth from Malkuth to Kether the kabbalist reachessimultaneously knowledge of God, the universe, and himself. This idearests upon the basic assumption that man is a microcosm of macrocosm,since he is created in the image of God. Furthermore, kabbalah is alsocharacterized by an emphasis on the importance of numbers and letters,and based on this emphasis various kabbalistic methods have been"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"57Historical Backgrounddeveloped that are concerned with detecting hidden meanings in reli-gious texts such as the Old Testament. According to Yates, Pico dividedkabbalah into two main branches:(1)Ars combinandi, the art of combining Hebrew letters.(2) ‘A way of capturing the powers of superior things,’ or thepowers of spirits and angels.12The second branch is obviously connected with the practice of magicand capturing the powers of spirits and angels implies the use of de-mons (i.e., spirits with a personal soul). Pico’s practice of magic, whichis not restricted to impersonal spirits, and the use of kabbalah as asafeguard for the magician, greatly influenced the magic of the Renais-sance. It is important to note that Pico’s magic, which made use ofsupernatural beings, exploited the borderland between magic and reli-gion. Or to quote Yates:The invoking, or conjuring, of angels forms an intrinsic part ofthe system, difficult to define, on the borderline of religiouscontemplation and magic.13Walker points out the dangers inherent in the two forms of magic fromthe point of view of the Church. The natural or nondemonic magic wasa threat to religion because it claimed to obtain the same results asreligion—without a supernatural agent. The demonic or angelic magicof Pico was a threat to the Church because it could be viewed as a rivalreligion—and the idea of rival religions was of course unacceptablefor the Church, since the Christian revelation was considered uniqueand exclusive.14The Spread of Western Esotericism across EuropeThe Renaissance linguist Johannes Reuchlin (1455–1522) was the au-thor of two important kabbalistic works; De verbo mirifico (1494), andDe arte cabbalistica (1517).15 The latter work was, according to Yates, tobecome the “Bible” of the Christian kabbalists.16 It was the first fulltreatise on kabbalah written by a Christian and it presented a clearpresentation of the Christian kabbalistic theor y and practice. Reuchlinwas heavily influenced by Pico, and in De verbo mirifico andDe artecabbalistica he presented a “Kabbalistic proof” of the existence of theholy trinity, which he had picked up from Pico.17 Reuchlin ascribed great"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"58Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationpowers to the Pentagrammaton (IHSUH), which for him was the Chris-tian sacred name, just as the Tetragrammaton (IHVH) was for the Jews.In this name was not only the power and strength of all, but it was alsoseen as a kabbalistic proof of the truth of the Christian doctrine of theHoly Trinity. Charles Zika sums up the meanings of the word to theRenaissance kabbalists:(. . .) by this word man can perform wonderful works beyondhuman strength, and although constituted in nature, hold do-minion over it. This word is a sign of the divine union in so faras it is the source of man’s superhuman activity.18In the German-speaking part of Europe, the works of the enigmaticBenedictine abbot Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) had acquired manyfollowers, most notably Agrippa and Paracelsus. His work Steganographia,which was published posthumously in 1606, treated a peculiar art ofmagic disguised in the form of cr yptography. His aim was to enable themagician to have access to a universal knowledge, and to allow him tocommunicate over great distances. Furthermore, the ultimate goal ofTrithemius’s occult writings was a mystical vision of God, or the convey-ance of the magician’s soul from earth to heaven. It was this ultimategoal that, according to Trithemius, separated his peculiar form of magicfrom the demonic magic of sorcerers and witches, a debased form ofmagic that Trithemius strongly condemned.19Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535)20 greatly admiredTrithemius and met him in 1509–1510, and even dedicated the first draftof his famous book De occulta philosophia to Trithemius. The book wasnot published until 1533, two years before Agrippa’s death.21 This workis a compendium or handbook in Renaissance esotericism. The naturalmagic of Ficino and the kabbalah of Pico are combined with the art ofalchemy, and thus the three “jewels” of Western esotericism: magic,astrology, and alchemy are linked together. Before Agrippa, hardly anyeffort was made to link alchemy with magic and astrology. Ficino andPico, for instance, showed ver y little, if any, interest in alchemy, but withAgrippa alchemy decidedly entered the world of magic and astrology.22Yates describes Agrippa as “something of an Erasmian evangelical,combining pre-Reformation humanism with an attempt to provide a ‘pow-erful’ philosophy to accompany evangelical reform.”23 The idea of usingthe occult philosophy as a powerful rejuvenating component to Chris-tianity became popular in the sixteenth centur y. The reformation andthe counterreformation caused many esotericists to view the Christianreligion as in need of something to regain its vitality and spiritual power."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"59Historical BackgroundFor Giordano Bruno, for instance, this “something” was the hermetismof the Corpus Hermeticum.24TheDe occulta philosophia is divided into three books, accordingto the threefold nature of the universe: the elemental world, the celestialworld, and the intellectual world.25 The three worlds are set in a hierar-chy with the elemental world (the sublunar y world) at the bottom andthe intellectual world at the top. The influences from God descendthrough the three worlds “through the angels in the intellectual world,to the stars in the celestial world, and then thence to the elements andall things composed of them in the terrestrial world.”26 Accordingly, thethree parts of the book deal with the appropriate magic of each world.The natural magic of Ficino for the natural world, celestial magic, or theart to attract and use influences from the stars for the celestial world,and finally, ceremonial magic that is directed to the angelic spirits of theintellectual world. For Agrippa the magical power was more potentthe higher up in the worlds the magician got it. The ceremonial magicof the intellectual world was thus more potent than the celestial magic(also called mathematical magic since it operates with numbers) of thecelestial world. The use of celestial and ceremonial magic exposed themagician to the grave danger of being influenced by demons, but Agrippaargued that the use of kabbalah guaranteed the safety of the operatoragainst demons on all levels. This argument Agrippa clearly derivedfrom Pico. Thus Agrippa, just as Pico, aimed higher with his magic thanFicino openly dared to do. Another great difference between Agrippaand Ficino, is that he advocated a “transitive” form of magic, to useWalkers terminology. This means that Agrippa’s magic also aimed atinfluencing other people through the will of the magician, whereasFicino’s magic had been self-centered, not aiming at anyone except themagician himself. Concerning Agrippa Walker has the following to say:[Agrippa] exposes what Ficino, rather feebly, had tried to con-ceal: that his magic was really demonic. He also mixes it up withmagic that aims at transitive, thaumaturgic effects, whereasFicino’s ef fects were subjective and psychological. Finally, andmost importantly, by treating magic, pagan religion and Chris-tianity as activities and beliefs of exactly the same kind, hedemonstrates strikingly how dangerous Neoplatonic magic wasfrom a Christian point of view.27Agrippa’sDe vanitate scientiarum was published in 1526, five years earlierthanDe occulta philosophia, but written several years after the latter. Inthis work he examines all man’s sciences and finds them all empty"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"60Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiation(including magic), and that all knowledge is in vain. The only thing thatis not in vain is “the Word of God in the Scriptures through which wemay come to know Jesus Christ.”28 Superficially, the De vanitatescientiarum seems to stand in sharp contrast to De occulta philosophiasince it clearly states that the ver y magic that he advocates is empty andin vain. But if we bear in mind that magic or occult philosophy was forAgrippa not a goal in itself, but something that should be used as an aidin the evangelical reform, which ultimately aimed at bringing Christian-ity back to a closer knowledge of Jesus Christ, we come perhaps closerto understanding the enigma of this man.The Esoteric Missions of Giordano Bruno and John DeeThere are several similarities between Giordano Bruno (1548–1600) andJohn Dee (1527–1608). Both were strongly influenced by theNeoplatonism of Ficino and Pico, the kabbalah of Pico, and by Agrippa’sDe occulta philosophia. They were both engaged in a spiritual mission,which was closely connected with Western esotericism, and they bothfailed in their quests and died viewed as dangerous sorcerers and her-etics, with Bruno burned at the stake in 1600.In her book Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (1964),Yates has shown how Bruno was influenced by Ficino, Pico, and Agrippa,but also the importance of the Corpus Hermeticum for him. She tracesthe occult practices of Bruno, but, most importantly, she describes thephilosophical and religious reform that Bruno proposed. It was a her-metic reform of society, based on the Corpus Hermeticum.29 Accordingto Couliano, the magic of the Renaissance in general—and Bruno’s magicin particular—is a science that primarily (if not solely) works in theimaginative faculty of man. Magic is closely connected with eroticismand mnemonics, and it is vital to understand the significance of the lattertwo in order to fully understand the former. The magic that concerns ushere is theoretically a science of the imaginar y, which it explores throughits own methods and seeks to manipulate at will. At its greatest degreeof development, reached in the works of Giordano Bruno, magic is ameans of control over the individual and the masses based on deepknowledge of personal and collective erotic impulses.30The reason why Eros and magic are so closely connected, accord-ing to Couliano, is that they work in the same substance—the universalpneuma.31 The universal pneuma is another term for the Spiritus Mundi,which is connected to the human spiritus or spirit. Magic, a phantasmicprocess, makes use of the continuity of the individual spiritus and thespiritus mundi. The goal of Bruno’s magic is control over the imagina-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"61Historical Backgroundtive faculty of the operator himself, as well as control over other indi-viduals and crowds. The fundamental tool of the operator (or manipula-tor) is Eros—that which we love. The prior condition to magic, is faith.32The performer and the subject must believe in the efficacy of the magi-cal act in order for it to work. Without this faith, magic is useless. Themagician must create in his own imagination an idea that he truly be-lieves in, and then transmit this imaginative idea into the subject’s imagi-nation. Couliano argues that the work of Bruno entitled De vinculis ingenere in fact is a handbook that sums up Bruno’s magic.33The Neoplatonism and kabbalah of John Dee was heavily influ-enced by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Another influence on Dee’sconception of the universe was Agrippa and his idea of dividing theuniverse into the natural, celestial, and supercelestial (intellectual) worlds.Yates argued in her work The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age(1979) that Dee sought to cause a religious reform based on a hermetic-kabbalistic philosophy.34 Dee’s mission failed and the Renaissance magusturned into Faust and Neoplatonism became suppressed. Dee did, how-ever, leave an important testament among his published works that laterturned up in the so-called Rosicrucian manifestos at the beginning of theseventeenth centur y. This testament is the Monas Hieroglyphica pub-lished in 1564.35 According to Yates, the Monas Hieroglyphica is a state-ment of Dee’s entire philosophy. The central point in this work is acertain figure—the hieroglyphic monad itself. The Rosicrucian manifes-tos, issued in the German-speaking world, were heavily influenced byDee and one of them contains a version of the hieroglyphic monad.Yates makes a short analysis of this figure:Dee’s monas is a combination of the signs of the seven planets,plus the symbol for the zodiacal sign, Aries, representing fire. Itmust have some astral significance; alchemical operations seemimplied through the fire sign; it is also some kind of mathematicsor geometr y; but above all it is Cabala. It is related to ‘the stupen-dous fabric of the Hebrew letters.’ It is a ‘Cabalistic grammar.’ Itcan be mathematically, cabalistically, and anagogically explained.36Dee himself regarded this work as highly important, and according toPeter J. French, Dee believed that “he had embodied universal wisdomin his Hermetic treatise, Monas Hieroglyphica.”37 Although the hiero-glyphic monad itself is composed of simple geometric elements, such asa point within a circle, two lines in straight angle, etc., the symbolism ofthe monad is highly complex and it has been interpreted in a numberof ways. Based on the twenty-two explanator y theorems of the original"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"62Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationtext, György Szonyi convincingly argues for a two-level interpretation ofthe monad: on the first level the monad is an astrological cosmogram,which explains the whole of Creation; on the second level it is a talismanicsummar y of the alchemical transmutation, that is, the spiritual quest thatleads from unenlightened seeker to enlightened Magus.38 The monad, onthe latter plane of reference, can thus be interpreted as a visual aid toinitiation set within the framework of sixteenth-centur y esotericism.There is a ver y interesting side of Dee’s magical operations, usu-ally referred to as “Enochian magic.”39 Between 1581 and 1586, andagain for a brief period in 1607, Dee communicated with angels. Thiscommunication was performed with the help of various mediumsthrough a cr ystal, referred to as a “showstone.” The most frequentlyused medium or “skr yer” was the alchemist Edward Kelley who wouldget in contact with angels, and Dee recorded what was being commu-nicated. Dee did not see this practice as a form of magic that was inopposition to his scientific worldview, but rather as a form of divinerevelation through the angels. With the help of the angels Dee tried topenetrate deeper into the divine mysteries of the Book of Nature, aquest that was fueled by apocalyptic and millenarian speculations onthe imminent Day of Judgement and the subsequent establishment ofthe New Jerusalem. The knowledge that the angels transmitted fallsmainly into two categories. On the one hand, in 1583 the angels beganto disclose to Dee and Kelley a particular mysterious language. It wasconsidered to be an angelic language and, correctly interpreted, it wasthe original lingua adamica of Adam and Enoch. On the other hand,the angels (or spirits) described spiritual hierarchies. Clulee arguesthat the conversations they had with angels were in fact a form ofmagic, but a form that differed from the usual magic of the Renais-sance. It is far removed from both the philosophical magic and occultphilosophy of the Renaissance as well as from the natural magic heseems to have derived from Roger Bacon. Despite the similarity of theangelology and demonology to material from someone like Agrippa,there is no hint here of the Neoplatonic/Stoic theor y of the spirit asthe vehicle of magical influence, or of the role of the imagination, orof the sympathetic use of the divine qualities in lower things to drawdown the influence of higher things. There is just the idea of the worldpopulated by hosts of spirits, and magic as the straightfor ward theurgicconjuration of them.40Even though Bruno and Dee failed in their individual efforts toreform religion and society, their ideas did, however, have some influ-ence through the Rosicrucian manifestos. These manifestos triggeredoff a new interest in Western esotericism, an esotericism that was closelyconnected to the idea of secret brotherhoods and magical orders."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"63Historical BackgroundChristian Rosenkreutz and the Rosicrucian ManifestosIn Germany there appeared in 1614 a text entitled Fama Fraternitatisthat today is generally regarded as the first Rosicrucian manifesto. Boundtogether with this text was another short work entitled The GeneralReformation of the Whole Wide World.41 In the following two years twomore texts appeared, Confessio Fraternitatis (1615) and The chemicalwedding of Christian Rosencreutz (1616).42TheFama Fraternitas describes how a certain C. R.43 traveled inhis early teens to the east, and there “got acquainted with the wise menof Damascus in Arabia, and beheld what great wonders they wrought,and how Nature was discovered unto them.”44 In Fez he learned math-ematics, physics, magic—“for in those are they of Fez most skilful”—and the art of kabbalah. After some of years of studying these scienceshe went to Spain where he hoped to share what he had learned in theOrient. This failed, however, because of their reluctance to learn some-thing new and thereby admitting that their previous knowledge was fullof errors. He was laughed at, so he left Spain and tried to spread hisknowledge in other countries, but ever ywhere he met with the samereactions. He finally settled down in the German-speaking world wherehe founded a brotherhood called the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, cen-tered around a building called Sancti Spiritus. Originally the fraternityconsisted of four members, but the number increased gradually. Centralto their study was a certain “magical language and writing, with a largedictionar y, which we yet daily use to God’s praise and glor y, and do findgreat wisdom therein.” There was also a mysterious book called LiberM, which C. R. had translated and brought with him from Damascus.This book Paracelsus had—according to the Fama—studied “diligently,”although not being a member of the fraternity. The brethren boundthemselves to maintain six articles that formed their code of living.First, That none of them should profess any other thing than to curethe sick, and that gratis. 2. None of the posterity should be constrainedto wear one certain kind of habit, but therein to follow the custom ofthe countr y. 3. That ever y year upon the day C. they should meettogether in the house S. Spiritus, or write the cause of his absence. 4.Ever y brother should look about for a worthy person, who, after hisdecease, might succeed him. 5. The word C. R. should be their seal,mark, and character. 6. The Fraternity should remain secret one hun-dred years.45One hundred twenty years after the death of C. R. (i.e., 1604) his gravewas rediscovered by the brethren and thus a prophecy that was inscribed"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"64Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationupon the door of the vault with his grave was fulfilled.46 In his tombthere were several objects and books of great importance. After a de-scription of the tomb, its objects, and the body of C. R., the Fama con-tinues by inviting new members to the fraternity with a promise thatjoining will be beneficial “in goods, body, and soul.”The two most important themes in the Fama are on the one handthe idea of a “general reformation of the world,” and on the other hand,the important claim that this reformation is closely connected to a secretfraternity—the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross. The rediscover y of the vaultis seen as analogous to the rediscover y of a certain important knowl-edge for Europe: “For like as our door was after so many years wonder-fully discovered, also there shall be opened a door to Europe (when thewall is removed) which already doth begin to appear, and with greatdesire is expected of many.” Yates concludes the following concerningthe Rosicrucian reform:This ver y peculiar document, the Fama Fraternitatis, thus seemsto recount, through the allegor y of the vault, the discover y of anew, or rather new-old, philosophy, primarily alchemical andrelated to medicine and healing, but also concerned with num-ber and geometr y and with the production of mechanical mar-vels. It represents, not only an advancement of learning, butabove all an illumination of a religious and spiritual nature. Thisnew philosophy is about to be revealed to the world and willbring about a general reformation. The mythical agents of itsspread are the R. C. Brothers.47Inherent in the need for a reformation lays a critique of the spiritualstate of Europe. The reform, or redemption as Faivre calls it, would notoccur through the churches, “but by means of a universal spiritual sci-ence in which heart and mind are united.”48TheConfessio is basically a restatement of the Fama. It criticizesthe spiritual (and political) state in Europe, especially the Pope. It fur-ther argues for the need of a reformation, which the Fraternity of theRosy Cross is about to set in motion. It tries to justify why the fraternitypublicly announces its existence, and once again invites new membersto join, as long as they are worthy of it. The ones who merely seekfortune or personal gain will not be able to get in contact with thefraternity. It also hints at the great secrets that they possess, chiefly acertain magical language, and a book that contains all the books in theworld, but also a promise of a means by which one is able to know allthat is possible to know. This last promise seems to echo the aim ofTrithemius’ magic."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"65Historical BackgroundWere it not excellent you dwell in one place, that neither thepeople which dwell beyond the River Ganges in the Indies couldhide anything, nor those which live in Peru might be able tokeep secret their counsels from thee?49The second Rosicrucian manifesto, the Confessio of 1615, has publishedwith it a tract in Latin called “A Brief Consideration of More SecretPhilosophy.” This “Brief Consideration” is based on John Dee’s MonasHieroglyphica, much of it being word-for-word quotations from the Mo-nas. This discourse is indissolubly linked to the Rosicrucian manifesto,which follows it, the Confessio. And the Confessio is indissolubly linkedwith the first manifesto, the Fama of 1614, the themes of which it re-peats. Thus it becomes evident that the “more secret philosophy” be-hind the manifestos was the philosophy of John Dee, as summed up inhisMonas Hieroglyphica.50 According to Yates, Dee’s influence on theRosicrucian manifestos was the result of his mission in Bohemia in the1580s, where he had tried to spread his reforming religiosity based onhermetic, magical, and alchemical teachings,51 (to which should be addedthe influence of the kabbalah).The third, and last manifesto issued, was the Alchemical Weddingof Christian Rosencreutz in 1616. This imaginar y novel was written byJohann Valentin Andreae (1586–1654) in his early teens.52 It is basicallyan alchemical allegor y spanning over seven days where ChristianRosenkreutz attends a wedding between a king and a queen, the al-chemical reincarnation and union of the male and female principles inman.53 In the first edition of this work there was printed in the marginDee’s mystical sign, the Monas itself. It is also a spiritual allegor y overthe processes of regeneration and change within the soul.54 But mostimportantly for the present study, the Alchemical Wedding is in factdescribing an initiation.55 Suffice to say at present though that we herehave a document, even though a fictive one, which describes an initia-tion that transmits the “secret knowledge” that the Fraternity of the RosyCross claimed to possess—a knowledge that primarily was based onJohn Dee. And, as has been shown in this short sur vey, Dee derived hisesoteric knowledge from the likes: Agrippa, Pico, and Ficino.Concluding RemarksWestern esotericism is a form of thought that was formed during theRenaissance out of various antique and medieval sources. The two mostimportant factors that helped to popularize and spread esotericismthroughout Europe were on the one hand the hermetism/hermeticismof the Corpus Hermeticum, which Marsilio Ficino had translated into"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"66Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationLatin, and on the other hand the Kabbalah that, to a large extent, GiovanniPico della Mirandola had brought to the Christian attention.Western esotericism spread across Europe and gathered such di-verse followers as Trithemius, Agrippa, Bruno, and Dee. Esotericismwas looked upon as a powerful philosophy that could be used in reform-ing religion and society. Giordano Bruno and John Dee set out on per-sonal missions to propagate this spiritual reform. At the beginning of theseventeenth centur y three small pamphlets heavily influenced by Deeappeared in Germany. These texts are known as the Rosicrucian manifes-tos, and they call for a general reformation of the world through a secretphilosophy that a certain Fraternity of the Rosy Cross claims to possess.The Rosicrucian manifestos caused a great interest in this mythi-cal fraternity, and as a result, a boom of secret and closed societiesemerged. Most of these societies worked out systems of initiation, whichtransmitted the esoteric form of thought through symbols and allego-ries. The rituals of initiation that were employed are the focus of thepresent study. With this chapter’s brief introduction to Western eso-tericism as a key, it is now time to unlock the mysteries of the esotericsocieties, and venture into their world of secret temples and lodges, and,most importantly, lift the veil of their rituals of initiation."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Chapter 4The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yThe Emergence of Freemasonr yScholars today tend to regard 1717 as a purely artificial date for theinception of Freemasonr y.

The histor y of Freemasonr y hasalways been an important aspect of masonic literature. In fact, The Con-stitutions of the Free-Masons (often referred to as Anderson’s Constitu-tion) published in 1723, the decidedly single most formative and influen-tial masonic text, begins with a lengthy histor y of the order, which isbased on medieval masonic constitutions, so-called Old Charges.1 JamesAnderson (1679–1739), a Scottish Non-Conformist minister of poor means,was commissioned by the Grand Master John Montagu (1690–1749) andthe Grand Lodge on September 29, 1721, to digest a number of OldCharges and present a new constitution.2 The histor y contained inAnderson’s Constitution was important to the post-1723 masons’ self-understanding since the work was read at their reception into the order.TO BE READAt the Admission of a NEW BROTHER, when the Master or Wardenshall begin, or order some other Brother to read as follows:3The histor y that the new initiates encountered at their initiation was alegendar y one, beginning with Adam, “created after the image of God,the great Architect of the Universe,” at the date Year of the World I, or4003 before Christ.

Anderson then goes on todescribe how masonr y was taught and passed on through biblical timesall the way to seventeenth-centur y England. The purpose of Andersonwas probably not to offer an objective histor y of Freemasonr y, but ratherto glorify masonr y, and to provide the Grand Lodge with “a past thatwould prove its outstanding importance.”5The form of Anderson’s histor y has clear similarities with thatconnected to the Renaissance Philosophia Perennis.6 The PhilosophiaPerennis was seen as a “true philosophy” that was transmitted througha chain of initiates, of which the most commonly recognized includedEnoch, Abraham, Noah, Zoroaster, Moses, Hermes Trismegistus, theBrahmins, the Druids, David, Orpheus, Pythogoras, Plato, and theSibylls.7 In a similar manner, geometr y and masonr y,8 were according toAnderson, transmitted through Adam, Cain, Seth, Noah, Japhet, Shem,Ham, the Chaldees and the Magi, Mitzraim, Abram, Moses (labeled“General Grand Master-Mason”), Solomon (“Grand Master of the Lodgeat Jerusalem”), Hiram (“the most accomplish’d Mason upon Earth”),Pythagoras, Euclid, Ptolomeus Philadelphus, Archimedes, Vitruvius,Augustus (“Grand-Master of the Lodge at Rome”), etc. The notion ofmasonr y as a secret tradition that has been handed down through theages is tightly connected with the legendar y histor y of Freemasonr y assuch. An illustrative example of this is found in The Perjur’d Free MasonDetected, published in 1730:But under these Discouragements there were always found AFEW, Fate so directing, who associating together, with the ut-most Secresy and Fidelity constantly instructed one another inthe Rules of Art, and preser ved their Councils from the Eyes ofall Men; binding themselves to one another by an inviolableOath of Secresy, and a Word or Token of Amity and Fellowship;by which Means they have preser v’d the Knowledge of Masonryin all its most exquisite and accomplish’d Parts, and handed itdown to us even to this Day.9TheOld Charges that Anderson founded his histor y upon (which hecalled Gothic Constitutions), is the name given to a collection of manu-scripts, of which the earliest, the Regius MS, dates from c. 1390. Accord-ing to Hamill, some 127 versions have been traced of which 113 are stillin existence.10 They follow the same basic pattern: a) An opening prayer.b) A legendar y histor y of the mason craft tracing it from biblical originsto its establishment in England. c) A code of regulations for Masters,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"69The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yFellows, and Apprentices covering both craft practices and morals.11 d)Arrangements for large-scale “territorial” assemblies at which attendancewas obligator y. e) Procedures for the trial and punishment of offenders.f) Admission procedures “for new men that were never charged before,”including an oath of fidelity.12 The Old Charges are important for ourunderstanding of early Freemasonr y in a number of ways. First, theyform a historical link between the medieval operative masons and thelater nonoperative masons because the texts were used by both catego-ries.13 Thus, they give credence to the theor y that modern Freemasonr yhas developed out of medieval operative masonr y. Second, many fea-tures of modern Freemasonr y can be found in these texts, and so it ispossible to account for some of the procedures found in early nonoperativemasonr y. Third, the elaborate legendar y histor y gives us a picture ofjust how elevated the masonic craft was perceived to be by both opera-tive and nonoperative masons alike. Fourth, and most important to ourpurpose, the Old Charges are crucial to our understanding of masonicrituals of initiation as they contain the earliest references to the admis-sion procedures that later developed into this particular type of rituals.Until quite recently it was assumed among scholars that non-operative masonr y developed out of medieval guilds of stonemasons inEngland during the seventeenth centur y. The importance placed on theEnglish origins of Freemasonr y is apparent in influential works such asThe Craft—A History of English Freemasonry by John Hamill.14 However,new research shows that the development in Scotland during the sameperiod probably played a more significant part than previously assumed.David Stevenson has provided enough material evidence to allow for areevaluation of Scotland’s part in the transition of masonr y from anoperative organization into nonoperative Freemasonr y.15 Apart from pro-viding a wealth of masonic “firsts” to be found in Scotland—such as theearliest attempts at organizing lodges at a national level, earliest ex-amples of “nonoperatives” joining lodges, earliest evidence connectinglodge masonr y with specific ethical ideas expounded by use of sym-bols, earliest references to the Mason Word, earliest “masonic cat-echisms” expounding the Mason Word and describing rites of initia-tion, earliest evidence of the use of two degrees or grades within ma-sonr y, earliest evidence of the emergence of a third grade16—Stevensonargues that the formation of Freemasonr y took place in Scotland, andnot in England.The Medieval contribution, of craft organisation and legend,provided some of the ingredients essential to the formation offreemasonr y, but the process of combining these with other"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"70Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationingredients did not take place until the years around 1600, andit took place in Scotland.17Furthermore, Stevenson does not only place the formation of Freema-sonr y in Scotland around 1600, but even identifies what he believes tobe the individual responsible for the creation of Freemasonr y:He [William Shaw] set out to reorganise the mason craft inScotland and endow it with a new stature and meaning: and indoing so he created freemasonr y.18William Shaw (c. 1550–1602) had been appointed the king’s master ofworks in 1583, which meant that he was in charge of all the majorbuilding projects in Scotland. Shaw was apparently not merely inter-ested in the administrative and financial aspects of his appointment,but also took an active part in the architectural considerations of thebuilding projects and, furthermore, had far-reaching ambitions to reor-ganize the masonic craft. In two separate Statutes from 1598 and 1599,Shaw set out rules that were to be obser ved by the masons in Scot-land. From a ritual perspective the first Shaw Statute appears to be themost important one, as this statute apparently regulated the form ofadmitting new members to lodges. According to Stevenson, the rites ofthe new organization, though they presumably grew out of older me-dieval rites, were based on the Mason Word, and “there is no pre-seventeen-centur y evidence for the existence of the Word.”19 Eventhough the First Shaw Statutes do not state how the actual ritualsshould be performed it is clear that a minimum number of membershad to be present and that the skill and worthiness of the candidateswere tried.Early Freemasonr y and Western EsotericismIt is often assumed that Western esotericism only enters the world ofmasonr y by the middle of the eighteenth centur y—through the so-calledhigh or additional degrees—and that the early Craft masonr y, as it waspracticed on the British Isles, was merely moral in character. There isevidence, however, that as early as the first half of the seventeenthcentur y masonr y was often perceived of as linked to what we today callWestern esotericism. In fact, the earliest printed reference to the MasonWord in The Muses Threnodie of 1638, connects the “Brethren of theRosie Cross” with the Mason Word:"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"71The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yFor what we do presage is not in grosse,For we be brethren of the Rosie Crosse;VVe have the Mason word, and second sight,Things for to come we can foretell aright;20In the same manner, the earliest-known printed reference to AcceptedMasons is also to be found in connection to esoteric topics. In a “diver-tissement” published in Poor Robin’s Intelligence for October 10, 1676,the “Company of accepted Masons” is mentioned in an ironical mannertogether with the “Ancient Brother-hood of the Rosy-Cross” and the“Hermetick Adepti”:These are to give notice, that the Modern Green-ribbon’d Caball,together with the Ancient Brother-hood of the Rosy-Cross; theHermetick Adepti, and the Company of accepted Masons, in-tend all to Dine together on the 31 [sic] of November next, at theFlying-Bull in Wind-Mill-Crown-Street; having already given orderfor great store of Black-Swan Pies, Poach’d Phœnixes Eggs,Haunches of Unicorns, & c.

The primar y purpose of the clubappears to have been to gather political opponents to the court, in whatcan be called a “debating and intelligence resort.”22 The “HermetickAdepti” most likely referred to a group of alchemists, since the Englishword “Hermetick” in the seventeenth centur y was often used as synony-mous with alchemy. As we shall see, alchemy came to be regarded asan important part of masonr y, even before the latter part of the eigh-teenth centur y when the so-called alchemical degrees were developedon the continent. However, it was through Rosicrucianism that the pub-lic eye most often viewed early masonr y as part of what we today callWestern esotericism. The first English expositor and defender ofRosicrucianism was Robert Fludd23 (1574–1637), who in 1616 publishedhisApologia Compendiara Fraternitatem de Rosea Cruce. Fludd’s inter-pretation of Rosicrucianism, as well as his interpretation of alchemy,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"72Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationbecame more spiritualized over the years. English Rosicrucianism dur-ing the seventeenth centur y differed from its German and French coun-terparts, as it blended with alchemy in a far more outspoken manner.The first English edition of the Fama and Confessio was published in1652, in a translation by the alchemist and mystic Thomas Vaughan(1621–1665).24 According to Waite, it was Vaughan who two years previ-ously, in 1650, had published the first printed English reference to theRosy Cross in England (twelve years after the publication of The MusesThrenodie in Scotland).25 References to Rosicrucian themes can, how-ever, be found earlier in one of Ben Johnson’s masques of 1626, and inFrancis Bacon’s New Atlantis (1627), which “presented a utopian dreamof an ideal scientific and religious society based on an order of priest-scientists pursuing the search for knowledge, a dream which includedadaptations of many Rosicrucian motifs.”26A further reference, albeit a casual one, to Rosicrucians and ma-sons is to be found in a poem entitled The Knight, printed as a pamphletin 1723:And in the Rosi-crucian Trade,He knew all has been writ or said,And might for an Adeptus pass,As most Men think indeed he was.Well vers’d he was in all the FanciesOfHydro-pyro-geo-mancies,And many learned Things could tellOf Knots and Charms, and the Night Spell,Which make the Devil stand as Warden,To watch a Deer-park or a GardenA Charm for Masons and for Sclaters,That could be writ in Golden Letters,He had, which, when they us’d their Calling,Would keep them from all Harm by Falling;In coming down make no more Haste,Than going up, Probatum est.27By the mid-1720s, we find the first printed references to asupposed Rosicrucian influence on masonr y. The references toRosicrucianism, in connection to masonr y, had up until then been re-stricted to casual remarks, with no clear arguments as to the supposedconnection between the two. In a mock advertisement printed in TheDaily Journal of December 27, 1725 it is claimed that “Masonr y” hadreceived a “new light from some worthy Rosicrucians”:"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"73The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yFriday,Dec. 24. 1725.The Brethren of the Shears and Shopboard are hereby Informed,that their Whimsical kinsmen of the Hod and Trowel, having (onnew Light received from some worthy Rosicrucians) thought fitto change both their Patron and Day, and unexpectedly taken upour usual Place of Meeting: The Worshipful Society of Free andAccepted TAYLORS are desired to meet on Monday next, the27th Instant, at the FOLLY on the Thames, in order to Chuse aGrand Master, and other Officers, and to Dine.You are desired to come Cloathed, and Armed with, BodkinandThimble.28According to Knoop, Jones, and Hamer this is the first known referenceof suggested Rosicrucian influence on masonic development. In an anony-mous letter printed in The Daily Journal of September 5, 1730, it isclaimed that the English Freemasons were ashamed of their true origin,which according to the anonymous author was to be found in the build-ing activities of Edward III at Windsor in the fourteenth centur y, andinstead “took great pains to persuade the world” that they derived from,and were the same as, the Rosicrucians:It must be confessed, that there is a Society abroad, from whomthe English Free-Masons (asham’d of their true Origin, as above)have copied a few Ceremonies, and take great Pains to per-suade the World that they are derived from them, and are thesame with them: These are called Rosicrucians, from their PrimeOfficers, (Such as our Brethren call Grand Master,Wardens,&c.) being distinguished on their High Days with Red Crosses.This is said to be a worthy, tho’ they affect to be thought amystical Society, and promote chearfully one another’s Benefitin a ver y extraordinar y Manner, they meeting for better Pur-poses than Eating and Drinking, or glor ying like Batts, thoseamphibious Birds of Night, in their Wings of Leather.

In two separateentries he mentions his admittance into masonr y in 1646, and a subse-quent attendance in a masonic lodge thirty years later.31 On the basis ofcertain Rosicrucian manuscripts in Ashmole’s collection, now at theBodleian Librar y, it has often been claimed that Ashmole was aRosicrucian himself. Ashmole had copied out by his own hand anEnglish translation of the Fama and the Confessio, to which he hadaffixed a petition to be allowed to join the Rosicrucian Fraternity.32 Thisis not the place, or the time, to enter into the discussion whether or notAshmole was a Rosicrucian, but the fact that Ashmole was a mason, andthat he took such a large interest in the Fama and the Confessio as tocopy it by hand, shows that the two were not seen as incompatible witheach other as early as the seventeenth centur y, at least not in this par-ticular case. In fact, one of the earliest Rosicrucian texts published inEngland, a tract called Summum Bonum from 1629, deals withRosicrucian matters in what appears to be a ver y “masonic manner.” Inthe tract, the Rosicrucian brotherhood is not perceived of anymore as areal secret brotherhood to which one can apply for membership, butrather as a spiritual brotherhood. According to Waite, the SummumBonum defines the brotherhood as a “Company of Spiritual Builders”that is set out to build a “Spiritual Palace, a House founded on the Rock,the Holy Place of a Holy Priesthood.”33 Furthermore, the “corner-stoneof this building is Christ, while those who are integrated in the Houseare the Living Stones thereof.”34 By interpreting the Rosicrucian broth-erhood as a company of spiritual builders the author of Summum Bonumechoes a characteristic masonic theme, that of the masons building anew, spiritual temple. For instance, in the dedication of Long Liverspublished 1722, the translator-editor Eugenius Philalethes Jr. writes:Remember that you are the Salt of the Earth, the Light of theWorld, and the Fire of the Universe. Ye are living Stones, builtup a spiritual House, who believe and rely on the chief LapisAngularis, which the refractor y and disobedient Builders dis-allowed, you are called from Darkness to Light, you are a cho-sen Generation, a royal Priesthood.35"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"75The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yThe “Salt of the Earth,”36 the “Light of the World,”37 and the “Fire of theUniverse”38 might, apart from their biblical references, refer to alchemi-cal concepts. In the light of the fact that English Rosicrucianism of theseventeenth centur y was heavily influenced by alchemy, it is perhapsnot so surprising that masonr y was not only viewed as connected toRosicrucianism, but to alchemy as well. The following quotation fromLong Livers provides us with an illustrative specimen of alchemical writ-ing of the period, in which we find a number of typical symbols:And now, my Brethren, you of the higher Class, permit me afew Words, since you are but few; and these few Words I shallspeak to you in Riddles, because to you it is given to know thoseMysteries which are hidden from the Unworthy.Have you not seen then, my dearest Brethren, that stupen-dous Bath, filled with most limpid Water, than which no Purecan be purer, of such admirable Mechanism that makes eventhe greatest Philosopher gaze with Wonder and Astonishment,and is the Subject of the eternal Contemplation of the wisestMen.

O mystical Union! O admi-rable Commerce!39As we have seen, there are numerous printed references from the sev-enteenth and early eighteenth centuries in which masonr y, both opera-tive and nonoperative, are perceived of as linked to Rosicrucianism and/or alchemy. Why then did the authors of these texts believe that therewas some sort of connection between masonr y and these particularaspects of Western esotericism? I assume that one reason lies in the factthat masonr y was a closed society into which one could only enter byundergoing a secret ritual of initiation. The parallel to the Fraternity ofthe Rosy Cross as proclaimed in the Fama and the Confessio (as well asin the writings of the English Rosicrucians of the period) is striking, to"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"76Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationsay the least. In the same manner, alchemy was seen as somethingreser ved for initiates, for persons who could decipher the alchemicalsymbols. Furthermore, the masonic initiation could have been inter-preted as the alchemical idea of transmutation, which often implied aspiritual refinement of the alchemist himself. This is of course merespeculation on my part, but the fact nonetheless remains that masonr ywas often seen as compatible with what we today call Western esotericism.It is now time to turn our attention from how masonr y was perceivedfrom the outside, to how masonr y actually worked on the inside—it istime to analyze the ritual evidence.The Pre-1730 Ritual EvidenceThe development of the masonic Craft degrees, as we know them today,was a long and gradual process. We know ver y little of the developmentfrom operative rituals of admission into the later rituals of initiation ofnonoperative masonr y, but the information we have shows that thenonoperative rituals owed much of their form and content to the earlieroperative rituals. As mentioned, the development was a gradual process,a process that had its perhaps most formative period during the seven-teenth centur y and the first three decades of the eighteenth. With thepublication of Samuel Prichard’s Masonry Dissected in 1730 the develop-ment of the Craft degrees had reached its completion in the sense thatthere were now three degrees: Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, andMaster Mason. Prior to 1730 the Craft rituals had consisted of only tworituals, Entered Apprentice and Fellow Craft or Master Mason. How-ever, by 1730 the Entered Apprentice ritual had been split into twodegrees, Entered Apprentice and Fellow Craft, thus inserting a newdegree between the two former ones. The old second degree becamethe third degree, called Master Mason.40The sources of our knowledge of the pre-1730 rituals consist ofeight manuscripts and six printed texts, of which the earliest, TheEdinburgh Register House MS, is from 1696.41 All these texts are in theform of a catechism, that is questions and answers, whose apparentobject it is to verify whether or not a person is an initiated mason. Fromthese questions and answers we can extract much information to recon-struct rituals of initiation that were in use during this period. From 1737onward, especially in France, the exposures are more descriptive innature and thereby give us more information about how the rituals wereactually performed.42 From 1760 we find the same type of descriptiveexposures in England.43Discussing the evolution of the early catechisms Knoop, Jones,and Hamer divide the documents into four groups. (1) Edinburgh Reg-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"77The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yister House and Chetwood Crawley MSS that probably represent Scottishoperative working in the later decades of the seventeenth centur y. (2) AMason’s Confession that professedly represents Scottish operative work-ing in the third decade of the eighteenth centur y. (3) The main body ofthe catechisms that supposedly or professedly exhibit the ceremonies ofaccepted or nonoperative masons during the first three decades of theeighteenth centur y. (4) Samuel Prichard’s Masonry Dissected from 1730in which we find the first known description of the three-degree sys-tem.44 The printed texts, usually referred to as exposures since theyprofess to expose the secrets of Freemasonr y, closely follow the manu-script versions. The conditions of the manuscripts themselves revealthat they probably were used as aide-mémoire by masons; that is, theywere used by masons in order to remember the rituals that in thesedays were only transmitted orally.The earliest manuscript catechism, The Edinburgh Register HouseMS from 1696, contains, in a rough manner, most of the major elementsof a masonic ritual of initiation. The manuscript consists of two parts. Inthe first part, “SOME QUESTIONES THAT MASONS PUT TO THOSE WHO HAVE YEWORD BEFORE THEY WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THEM,” there are fifteen questionsaimed at verifying whether a person is a mason, or Entered Apprentice,and two questions whether he is a “fellow craft.” After an affirmativeanswer to the question whether one is a mason, one is asked to explainthe “first point”:What is the first point? Ans: Tell me the first point ile tell youthe second, The first is to heill and conceall, second, under noless pain, which is then cutting of your throat, For you mustmake that sign, when you say that [.]45From the answer it is possible to identify three common features of latermasonic rituals. First, the practice to give the Mason Word, either bylettering it, or by dividing it in two parts, so that the candidate and anofficer together give the whole word. Second, the cutting of the throatrefers to the penalty of breaking the oath of the first degree. Third, “youmust make that sign” is an allusion to the earliest form of the EnteredApprentice sign, which is made by holding the hand right and across thethroat, and then making a smart move with the hand as if cutting thethroat.46 In the second part of the manuscript, this part of the ritual isfurther explained:Here come I the youngest and last entered apprentice As I amsworn by God and St Jhon by the Square and compass, andcommon judge to attend my masters ser vice at the honourable"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"78Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationlodge, from munday in the morning till saturday at night and tokeep the Keyes therof, under no less pain then haveing my tonguecut out under my chin and of being buried, within the flood markwhere no man shall know, then he makes the sign again withdrawing his hand under his chin alongst his throat which denotesthat it be cut out in caise he break his word.47 [my emphasis]The fourth to the thirteenth questions deal with the nature of the lodgein which the candidate was “entered.” A “true and perfect lodge” ismade of seven Masters and five Entered Apprentices, or five [Master]Masons and three Entered Apprentices, and is supposed to be locateda day’s journey from a “burroughs town.” After stating the name of thelodge in which the candidate was entered (in this case the lodge ofKilwinning), it is explained that the lodge stands east and west as thetemple of Jerusalem—and it was in the porch of Solomon’s temple thatthe first lodge was held. The temple of Jerusalem, apparently an impor-tant symbol in masonic rituals as early as 1696, develops in the firstthree decades of the eighteenth centur y into one of the most importantcharacteristics of the Craft rituals, especially with the emergence of thethird degree from 1730 onward. The building site of Solomon’s templebecomes the mythological scene of the rituals, and early on there arespeculations concerning the nature of the new temple that the masonsare set out to build. The lodge that was supposed to have been locatedin the porch of Solomon’s temple was seen as the first masonic lodge,and Solomon’s temple was considered to be the “model” on which anew—spiritual—temple was to be built.In the lodge there are three “lights”: in the northeast, southwest,and the east, whose symbolism is explained as “The one denotes themaster mason, the other the warden The third the setter croft [shouldprobably be Fellow Craft].”48 Furthermore, there are three “jewels” inthe lodge: “Perpend Esler a Square pavement and a broad oval.” Thethree lights and jewels of the lodge remain important symbols in masoniclodges to this day, but the interpretation and the exact nature of thesesymbols have varied over the years.Questions fourteen and fifteen deal with the key to the lodge,which is described as a “well hung tongue” that lies in “the bone box.”The key to the lodge is to be found “Three foot and an half from thelodge door under a perpend esler, and a green divot. But under the lapof my liver where all my secrets of my heart lie.”49 In a later catechismthe bone box is explained as being the mouth, the bones being theteeth. It is interesting to note that there are only two questions that dealwith the Fellow Craft degree, of which only the second provides any"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"79The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yinformation about the ritual. This can perhaps be explained by the prob-ability that the second degree was not as developed ritually as that of thefirst degree. The only information that the Edinburgh Register House MSgive us is the following:How many points of the fellowship are ther Ans fyve viz foot tofoot Knee to Kn[ee] Heart to Heart, Hand to Hand and ear toear. Then make the sign of fellowship and shake hand and youwill be acknowledged a true mason. The words are in the I ofthe Kings Ch 7, v, 21, and in 2 chr: ch 3 verse last.50The Five Points of Fellowship are a combination of a posture, which hasto be made by two persons together, and the manner in which the wordis communicated, that is one has to stand in a certain position whencommunicating the word. From 1730 onward the sign of the Five Pointsof Fellowship is only used in the third degree, in the “raising” of Hiram.The words from the Old Testament are Jachin and Boaz, the names ofthe two pillars placed at the entrance to the temple of Solomon. Laterdocuments show that Jachin was the Entered Apprentice word, whileBoaz was that of the Fellow Crafts.The second part of the manuscript, which follows after the cat-echism, briefly describes the ritual itself, or “THE FORME OF GIVING THEMASON WORD.” The title of the second part is itself important as it clearlystates what appears to be the object of the masonic rituals in this period.In other words, the central feature of the masonic rituals was the trans-mission of the Mason Word, a word identified with Jachin in the EnteredApprentice degree, and Boaz in that of Fellow Craft.51 The three mainingredients of the ritual as described in the manuscript appear to be anordeal, an oath, and the communication of the traditional secrets. Theordeal is in the form of acts whose object is to frighten the candidate.The oath is taken with the right hand on the Bible (in most later docu-ments specified to be opened at the Gospel of St. John), while kneeling.Imprimis you are to take the person to take the word upon hisknees and after a great many ceremonies to frighten him youmake him take up the bible and laying his right hand on it youare to conjure him, to sec[r]ecie, By threatening that if [he]shall break his oath the sun in the firmament will be a witnessagst him and all the company then present, which will be anoccasion of his damnation and that likewise the masons will besure to murder him, Then after he hes promised secrecie Theygive him the oath a[s] follows52"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationThrough the oath the candidate affirms that he will never reveal, in anyway, what he is about to hear and see. After the oath he is “removed outof the company,” which presumably means that he is taken outside thelodge, where he is once again frightened “with 1000 ridicolous posturesand grimmaces.” He is then instructed by the youngest mason, that is,the most recent newly made member, in the traditional secrets and the“words of his entrie” already quoted. After being led inside the lodgeagain, and having said the “words of his entrie,” the word is beingcommunicated by the Master Mason after it has been whispered fromone member to another. The text then goes on to describe the proce-dure in making a “master mason or fellow craft.” After all the EnteredApprentices have left the lodge the one who is “to be admitted a mem-ber of fellowship” is put to his knees in order to take a new oath. As inthe previous degree, he is then led outside the lodge where he isinstructed in the “postures and signes of fellowship,” but this time thereis no mention of tr ying to frighten him. He then enters the lodge againand shows what he has learned, after which he receives the word whilestanding in the special posture together with the communicator of theword, that is in the position of the Five Points of Fellowship.Then the master gives him the word and gripes his hand afterthe masons way, which is all that is to be done to make him aperfect mason.53The fact that the Edinburgh Register House MS contains the main fea-tures of the Entered Apprentice and, to a lesser extent, the Fellow Craftrituals, is important, as it shows that later masonic rituals are conser va-tive when it comes to the basic components of the rituals. The other pre-1730 catechisms, though in essence in accordance with the EdinburghRegister House MS, exhibit a variety in details, both in regard to diver-gent interpretations and innovations. For instance, the Chetwode CrawleyMS.,c. 1700, gives an alternative explanation of the three lights that areto be found in a lodge: “The one denotes the Master mason, The otherthe Words [should probably be Ward(an)s] and the Third The ffellow-Craft.”54 As to innovations, the first reference to what has become per-haps the most characteristic regalia of Freemasonr y in the public mind—the leather apron and gloves—is found in the earliest-known printedcatechism,A Mason’s Examination from 1723. The text mentions that allof the fraternity receive a pair of men’s and women’s gloves, and aleather apron.55 In the same catechism we also find the earliest-knownuse of Hebrew letters:"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"81The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yQ.

Thefirst reference to the letter G in a ritual context is to be found in theWilkinson MS,c. 1727: “Q. What is the Center of yr Lodge[?] A. the letterG. Q. What does it Signify[?] A. Geometr y, or the fifth Science.”57 Lateron in the development of the rituals of Freemasonr y, the letter G be-comes a standard feature, which not only stands for geometr y, but inmany cases for God as well. Most of the catechisms are presented inwhat appears to be skeleton form, which means that they are devoid ofspeculations and elaborations on the significance of the rituals them-selves. There are, however, some exceptions to this. The Dumfries No.4 MS.,c. 1710, is the earliest catechism that contains a more speculativeand religious approach to the rituals. After a prayer and a short preface,the MS. contains a large section on the histor y of masonr y, based on thelegendar y histor y found in the Old Charges. The practice of masonr y iscalled a Royal Secret—which in those days was not an idle term—andit is stated in the text that the mason should be “true to god and the holycatholick church.” The strongly religious character of the MS. can beseen from the following quotation:Q what is meant by ye brassen see yt Hiram framed & sup-ported it by 12 oxen 3 looking towards ye north 3 towards yesouth 3 towards ye west 3 towards ye east A It was appointed tobath & wash ye preists in at yt time But now we finde it was tipeof Christs blood whose blood was to purg sin & to wash ye elect& ye 12 oxen a type of ye 12 apostles who opposed all heathen-ism & athism & sealed ye cause of christ wt there blood Q whatmeant ye golden dore of ye temple Qr they went in to sanctumsanctorum A it was another type of Christ who is ye door ye wayand the truth & ye life by whome & in whom all ye elect entrethinto heaven58The author of the text further explicitly identifies the temple of Jerusa-lem with Christ, and to a certain extent with the Church. Furthermore,the “mister y of the golden door of the temple” is explained as “Christ isthe dore of life by we we must enter into eternal happiness [. . .].”59 The"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"82Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationidentification of Christ with the temple was, however, by no means anunusual one. On the contrar y, the new temple was a common metaphorfor Christ.60 The religious aspect of early Freemasonr y can also be seenin how the Master of the lodge sometimes was interpreted. In the Insti-tution of Free Masons,c. 1725 we can see that God was considered to bethe Master of the lodge: “Who rules & governs the Lodge & is Masterof it? A. Iehovah the right Pillar.”61The earliest known MS. Catechism to recognize three classes ofmasons, with its own secrets, is The Trinity College, Dublin, MS., dated1711. In the text it is stated that the Master’s Word is the somewhatpeculiar word “matchpin.”The Masters sign is back bone, the word matchpin. The fellowcraftsman’s sign is knuckles, & sinues ye word Jachquin. TheEnterprentice’s sign is sinues, the word Boaz or its hollow.62From 1730 onward the quest for a lost Master’s Word becomes an im-portant feature of the third degree, as will be discussed presently. In thepost-1730 third-degree legend an old Master’s Word, YHVH, is replacedby the word Macbenac at the time of Hiram’s murder. The word issupposed to mean “the flesh falls from the bones” in allusion to thedecomposed state of Hiram’s corpse. It is still unclear from where theword Macbenac derives, but the pre-1730 texts reveal that different wordswere used as the new Master’s Word. The above quoted “matchpin” isan early example. Another example of a Master’s Word is “Mahabyn,”which is to be found in the Sloane MS. 3329,c. 1700.Another they haue called the masters word and is Mahabyn whichis allways divided into two words and Standing close With theirBreasts to each other the inside of Each others right Ancle Joyntsthe masters grip by their right hands and the top of their Lefthand fingers thurst close on ye small of each others Backboneand in that posture they Stand till they whisper in each otherseares ye one Maha- the other repleys Byn.63A variant of “Mahabyn” is the word “Maughbin” mentioned in A Mason’sExamination, printed in 1723.

Apart from its religiouscharacter the manuscript includes an early version of the Hiram legend,in which Noah has the part that after 1730 is ascribed to Hiram.65 Ac-cording to this early version Shem, Ham, and Japheth go to the graveof Noah to tr y to find anything that might lead them to the “vertuablesecret which this famieous preacher had.” The three men had agreedthat if they didn’t find the secret itself, then the “first thing that theyfound was to be to them as a secret.” When they came to the grave theyfound nothing save the dead body in a state of decay. When they triedto pull at one of its fingers it came off, and the same thing happenedwhen they tried with a joint, then another, the wrist, and finally theelbow. They then proceeded to raise the body of Noah with what evi-dently are the Five Points of Fellowship in an almost identical mannerto the raising of Hiram in later ritual texts.[so they] Reared up the dead body and suported it setting ffootto ffoot knee to knee Breast to breast Cheeck to check and handto back and cr yed out help o ffather as if they had said o fatherof heaven help us now for our Earthly ffather cannot so Laiddown the dead body again and not knowing what to do—so onesaid here is yet marrow in this bone and the second said but adr y bone and the third said it stinketh so they agreed for to giveit a name as is known to free masonr y to this day so went to theirundertakings and after wards works stood: yet it is to be believedand allso understood that the vertue did not proceed from whatthey ffound or how it was called but ffrom ffaith and prayer sothus it Contenued the will pass for the deed[.]66In the next section I will analyze the legend of the third degree in moredetail, and I will show that the interpretation of the legend during the1730s most likely can be explained from a Western esoteric standpoint.Even though the early catechisms show a variety of details, the mainfeatures of the Entered Apprentice degree can already be found in TheEdinburgh Register House MS from 1696. It is, however, noteworthy thatall the catechisms from this period, 1696–1730, focus on the EnteredApprentice degree, while the descriptions of the Fellow Craft degreeremain sparse. One possible reason for this is that during the initial, but"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"84Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationformative, period of development of the masonic rituals of initiation, itwas the first degree that was seen as the most significant ritual. How-ever, a more likely explanation is that secrecy about the first degree mayhave been less strict because it was regarded less important. Be that asit may, the catechisms from this period do not contain any clear refer-ences to Western esotericism, contrar y to what might have been ex-pected from how masonr y was perceived by outsiders during the sameperiod. There are thus no references to Rosicrucianism or alchemy,which, as we have seen, were often considered to be linked with ma-sonr y. However, references to kabbalah can be found in The GrandMystery Laid Open, published in 1726. These references are importantas they are the first explicit references in masonic catechisms to notonly kabbalah, but also to Western esotericism in general. Furthermore,it is significant that we find kabbalistic influence on masonic rituals inthe 1720s as it was during this period that the third degree ritual devel-oped into the form published by Samuel Prichard in 1730—a form influ-enced by kabbalistic speculations.Have the six Spiritual Signs any Names?

It is perhaps interestingto note that the author claims that without a “Key to Raymundus Lullius”it is impossible to come to the “Quintessence of Free-Masonry.”70 RamónLull (1235–1316) had a number of influential alchemical works attrib-uted to him, and was in alchemical literature considered to be an impor-tant adept of the art of alchemy. Lull was also considered to be anauthority on the Art of Memor y,71 which, according to Stephenson, wasimportant to William Shaw and the formation of Freemasonr y. Unfortu-nately, the author of A Letter to the Grand Mistress never specifies whatthe key to Lull actually might have been.The Master Mason Degreeand the Ritual Enactment of the Hiramic LegendSamuel Prichard’s Masonry Dissected, first published in October 1730, isthe perhaps most influential of all masonic exposures published in theeighteenth centur y, and the text ran into no less then thirty editions.According to the title page of the pamphlet, Prichard had been a masonhimself, a “late Member of a Constituted Lodge,” and his object of pub-lishing the exposure was explained in “The Author’s Vindication of him-self from the prejudiced Part of Mankind”:I was induced to publish this mighty Secret for the publick Good,at the Request of several Masons, and it will, I hope, give entireSatisfaction, and have its desired Effect in preventing so manycredulous Persons being drawn into so pernicious a Society.72Prichard’s assertion that he had published the pamphlet at the requestof several masons appears to be quite odd, to put it mildly. Why wouldmasons themselves want to publish their “mighty Secret” and therebyprevent persons from joining their “pernicious” society? If there is anytruth in Prichard’s claim, then perhaps it is possible to get to the motiveof these masons by looking at the result that Masonry Dissected hadupon the later development of masonic rituals. The obvious result ofPrichard’s text is the establishment of the three degrees and the ritualsconnected thereto. As there existed no official ritual handbooks at thistime—all rituals were supposed to be learned by heart—what better waymight there be of implementing a new degree then by making it readilyavailable by publishing it? Could the development of the third degree,and the peculiar mysticism connected thereto, have been the deliberateeffort of a group of masons who deemed it necessar y to reform themasonic system of initiation? Unless new information comes to light, we"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"86Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationcan never reach a conclusive answer to these questions. It is, however,interesting to note a peculiar part of Prichard’s vindication, which seemsto imply that the old form of masonr y needed to be “repair’d by someoccult Myster y,” or would soon be annihilated:[. . .] but it is ver y much doubted, and most reasonable to thinkit will be expended towards the forming another System ofMasonr y, the old Fabrick being so ruinous, that, unless repair’dby some occult Myster y, will soon be annihilated.73It is tempting to interpret the “occult Myster y” as the legend of Hiram.Masonry Dissected was, however, not only instrumental in establishingthe tri-gradual system74, but also had a formative effect upon the Craftdegrees as a whole. The Fellow Craft catechism of Masonry Dissecteddiffers from earlier catechisms most notably in two respects. First, the“Five Points of Fellowship” is dropped from the Fellow Craft degree,and instead figures prominently in the Master degree. Second, themyster y of the letter G becomes the main focus of the Followcraft de-gree, as shown by the following quotation:The Repeating of the Letter G.Resp.In the midst of Solomon’s Temple there stands a G,A Letter fair for all to read and see,But few there be that understandsWhat means that Letter G.Ex.My Friend, if you pretend to beOf this Fraternity,You can forthwith and rightly tellWhat means that Letter G.Resp.By Sciences are brought to LightBodies of various Kinds,Which do appear to perfect Sight;But none but Males shall know my Mind.Ex.The Right shall.

Geometr y, thefifth of the Seven Liberal Arts, has always been an important symbol inFreemasonr y, and the Old Charges show that it was an important aspectof operative masonr y as well.The catechism of the Master degree follows the same basic struc-ture as the pre-1730 catechisms of the Entered Apprentice and FellowCraft or Master Mason degrees. It begins with an affirmative answer tothe question whether the candidate is a Master Mason, an affirmationthat is checked through the posing of a number of questions. The an-swers reveal that the candidate was “pass’d” a Master in a “PerfectLodge of Masters,” which is made up of three Masters.76 He came to be“pass’d Master” by the help of God, the “square” and his own industr y,“from the square to the Compass.” The square and compass have aprominent place in masonic symbolism and have different interpreta-tions.77 He furthermore states that he has seen Jachin and Boaz and thathe was made a, most rare, Master Mason with Diamond, Ashler, and theSquare. By having seen the two pillars is meant that he has undergonethe previous two degrees. It is then stated that the word Machbenah willmake him free. Then follows the earliest known version of the legend ofHiram, which begins with the question of what the candidate is going todo in the West. He answers that he is going to “seek for that which waslost and is now found,” which he explains to be the Master Mason’sWord. The word had been lost by “Three Great Knocks, or the Deathof our Master Hiram.” During the building of Solomon’s Temple Hiramwas the Master Mason, and one day at high noon, when he was sur vey-ing the works as was his custom, he entered into the temple. There hewas attacked by three “ruffians,” who were supposed to be Fellow Crafts.The ruffians had placed themselves at each of the three entrances andthereby trapped Hiram inside the temple. One by one, they demandedthat he should give them the Master’s Word, but he replied that “he didnot receive it in such a manner, but Time and a little Patience” would"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"88Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationbring it to them. Each of them gave him a blow with a setting maul,setting tool, and a setting beadle, respectively. The last blow killed Hiramand the ruffians carried his body out of the temple through the westdoor, and hid him “under some Rubbish till High 12 again.” During thenight they carried his body to the “Brow of the Hill, where they madea decent Grave and buried him.” Hiram was, however, missed alreadythe same day, and King Solomon ordered fifteen “Loving Brothers” tosearch for him. They agreed that if they did not find the Word in himor about him, the first Word that came to them should be the newMaster’s Word. Then one of the brothers who was more tired than theothers sat down in order to rest himself. When he took hold of a shrubit came easily up, and he saw that the ground had been broken. Hecalled the other brothers and they found Hiram’s grave, which was cov-ered with moss and turf. They covered the grave again and placed a“sprig of Cassia,”78 at the head of the grave, and then went to tell KingSolomon what they had found. Solomon ordered that Hiram’s body shouldbe taken up to be buried decently, and that fifteen Fellow Crafts, withwhite Gloves and Aprons, should attend his funeral. Then follows thecrucial part of the ritual:Ex. How was Hiram rais’d? R. As all other Masons are, whenthey receive the Master’s Word.Ex. How is that? R. By the Five Points of Fellowship.Ex. What are they? Hand to Hand, Foot to Foot, Cheek to Cheek,Knee to Knee, and Hand in Back.N.B.WhenHiram was taken up, they took him by the Fore-fingers,and the Skin came of f, which is called the Slip; the spreading theRight Hand and placing the middle Finger to the Wrist, claspingthe Fore-finger and the Fourth to the Sides of the Wrist; is calledthe Gripe, and the Sign is placing the Thumb of the Right Handto the Left Breast, extending the Fingers.Ex.

Whispers him in the Ear, and supported by the Five Pointsof Fellowship before-mentioned, says Machbenah, which meansThe Builder is smitten.79The Five Points of Fellowship, which previously figured in the “FellowCraft or Master Mason” degree, assume an important part in the thirddegree ritual as it now becomes connected to the raising of Hiram. Theinitiates are identified with Hiram, and thus experience a ritual death. Itshould, however, be noted that the raising of Hiram is not a resurrectionsuch as encountered in, for instance, the myths of Osiris or the Gospelaccounts of the resurrection of Christ. It is only in certain later masonicHigh degree rituals that Hiram resurrects in the true sense of the word.The raising of Hiram in Masonry Dissected implies the raising of Hiram’sbody by the fifteen Fellow Crafts from the grave that the three ruffianshad made. The identification of the initiate with Hiram, through Hiram’sdeath, is nonetheless an important initiator y act—an identification thatbecomes even more important by the fact the Hiram, and thus the ini-tiate, becomes buried in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the temple. I willhave the opportunity to return to this topic shortly.The publication of Masonry Dissected provoked the publication ofresponses in which the honor of Freemasonr y was defended, and theintegrity of Samuel Prichard was questioned.80 One such answer was theanonymous A Defence of Masonry, published in 1730–1731. Apart froma polemic treatment of Prichard’s motives in publishing Masonry Dis-sected, the text includes an interesting discussion of masonr y’s apparentrelationship to ancient mysteries.81The Conformity between the Rites and Principles of Masonry (iftheDissection be true) to the many Customs and Ceremonies ofthe Ancients, must give Delight to a Person of any Taste andCuriosity, to find any Remains of Antique Usage and Learningpreser ved by a Society for many Ages, without Books or Writ-ing, by oral Tradition only.82Masonr y is particularly likened to the Pythagoreans, the Essenes, andthe Druids—but more importantly masonr y is connected to Kabbalah.Significantly enough, Kabbalah is specifically connected to the MasonWords, and it is thus the literar y Kabbalah, or gematria, which is seenas compatible with masonr y:"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationTheCabalists, another Sect, dealt in hidden and mysterious Cer-emonies. The Jews had great Regard for this Science, and thoughtthey made uncommon Discoveries by means of it. They dividedtheir Knowledge into Speculative and Operative.David andSolomon, they say, were exquisitely skilled in it, and no body atfirstpresumed to commit it to Writing; but, what seems mostto the present Purpose, the Perfection of their Skill consisted inwhat the Dissector calls Lettering of it, or by ordering the Lettersof a Word in a particular manner.83Is it possible to discern any traces of kabbalah in the Hiramic legend?A cursor y sur vey leads to a negative answer to the question: there arenoobvious references to kabbalah such as, for instance, any speculationsconcerning the emanations of God (the theor y of the Sephiroth derivingfrom the Sepher Yetzirah); no references to the feminine aspect of theDivine, the Shekinah; no speculations concerning numbers, gematria,inter alia. Nevertheless, the chief aspect of the legend, the search for alost word, offers an intriguing parallel with zoharic speculations con-cerning the loss of the proper way to pronounce the name of the Lord, theTetragrammaton (YHVH). According to kabbalistic tradition, the propermode of vocalization, or of pronouncing the Divine Name was a guardedsecret that was reser ved for the Holy of Holies within the temple of Jerusa-lem. The second siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC thatresulted in the destruction of Solomon’s temple and the beginning of theso-called Babylonian Captivity of the Jews that was to last until 538 BC,had the consequence that the High Priest no longer had the opportunityto pronounce the name of God.84 This subsequently led to the tragicconsequence that the true way of pronouncing the holy name passedinto oblivion. Thus, we find in the zoharic tradition a search for the lostname, or rather the true way of pronouncing a known name. A. E. Waite(1857–1942), one of the most influential masonic and esoteric amateurscholars of the first half of the twentieth centur y, has written extensivelyon the parallel between the zoharic and the masonic search for some-thing lost. Even though Waite lacked a proper academic training, ac-counting for his writing being “diffuse, often verbose, and peppered witharchaisms,”85 his firm belief that the originators of masonr y were versedin kabbalistic doctrine is worth considering:For myself I believe that the mystic hands which transformedFreemasonr y were the hands of a Kabalistic section of Wardensof the Secret Tradition; that their work is especially traceable inthe Craft Legend; and that although in its present form this"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"91The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr yLegend is much later and a work of the eighteenth centur y, itrepresents some part or reflection of those Zoharic preoccupa-tions which began in England with Robert Fludd, ThomasVaughan, were continued through Henr y More, and were inevidence both in France and Britain before and about the periodof the French Revolution.86In order to understand Waite’s arguments concerning the Craft Legend(i.e., the legend of Hiram), it is vital to be familiar with his convictionthat the object of the masonic initiation is a Unio Mystica with God.87 ForWaite the loss of the Master’s Word, which occurred at the moment ofthe murder of Hiram within the uncompleted Temple, and the subse-quent masonic search for this lost word, has its parallel in the zoharictradition. According to Waite, the early Christian kabbalists of theRenaissance held that the search for a lost name within the zoharictradition, in reality was about finding Christ. The originators of themasonic tradition, who had knowledge of the zoharic search, incorpo-rated the theme of a search for something lost (in this case the Master’sWord) to represent the search for Christ. To Waite, Verbum Christus Est,the lost Master’s Word is Christ.88 This claim would be unintelligible ifnot understood against a Kabbalistic background. The old Master’s Wordwas the name of the Lord, YHVH. According to Christian Kabbalistictradition, the name of God conceals the name of Jesus, and thus it is“Kabbalistically” proved that Christ is the Savior. By including the He-brew letter , Shin, (which by its shape was considered by Renaissancekabbalists to allude to the trinity) in the name of the Lord, Yod He VauHe, the name of Jesus emerges YHSVH, Yeheshuah or Jeheshua.89 ThisKabbalistic proof has been held in high esteem among Christiankabbalists such as Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) and JohannesReuchlin (1455–1522).The question now arises: to what extent are the two traditionsrelated? Recent research by Snoek tends to substantiate the theor y thatthe search for the Master’s Word is indeed influenced by the zoharicquest for the proper way of pronouncing the name of the Lord. Admit-tedly, Snoek does not mention the zoharic similarities, but his findingsare nonetheless confirming the kabbalistic connection. In two separatearticles Snoek has made a thorough study of the Hiramic legend andtherein reaches several important conclusions.90 According to the leg-end of Hiram, the old Master’s Word was lost at the occasion of Hiram’smurder, and a new Master’s Word was adopted, viz. Makbenak—believed to mean “the flesh falls from the bones.”91 The old Master’sWord was the name of God in Hebrew, Tetragrammaton, pronounced as"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"92Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationJehovah,92 which is the same name that figures in the zoharic tradition.The notion that the old Master’s Word was lost at the time of Hiram’sdeath, is indeed perplexing, to say the least, since it is clearly stated inthe legend itself that the old Word was YHVH. Snoek has unraveled thisknot by clearly showing that in the early English versions of the legendthere was never a question of losing the Word, but that which was lostwas rather the way of pronouncing the Word.93 According to the earlyversions of the legend the Master’s Word could only be pronounced bythe three Masters together, viz. King Solomon, King Hiram, and HiramAbiff. This is the reason why Hiram could not, as opposed to would not,reveal the word. Since Hiram had not passed on his knowledge beforebeing killed, the proper way of pronouncing the Master’s Word waslost.94 We have thus two traditions, the zoharic and the masonic, wherea central theme is the loss of the proper way of pronouncing the nameof the Lord, YHVH. To me, it seems highly unlikely that the choice ofthe old masonic Master’s Word would have been made without the in-fluence from Kabbalistic speculations on the name of God. Especiallysince the speculations concerning YHVH are not limited to the zoharictradition, but are an important aspect of the Christian Kabbalah as well.There is a further dimension connected to this common theme,namely that of Unio Mystica. Snoek has demonstrated in the mentionedarticles that Hiram in the early versions of the legend became identifiedwith the Lord. This identification is, in my opinion, of incalculable impor-tance when tr ying to understand the early masonic initiation:It should be clear by now that placing the name of God on thetomb of Hiram was a functional equivalent to his being buriedin the Sanctum Sanctorum. Both make clear that Hiram is infact Jahweh. It is precisely that which renders the third degreeritual an initiation of a ver y well-known kind: the candidate isidentified with a hero, who turns out to be (a) God. In that way,the ritual Unio Mystica between the candidate and the divinityis expressed and realized.95Viewing the legend of Hiram in the light of Snoek’s findings, shows thatthe legend in its original form was an “initiation myth,” as opposed tothe later versions where the legend adopts the function of a “moralisticstor y.” The link to the zoharic tradition becomes stronger when theinitiatic aspect of the legend is stressed. At the core of the JewishKabbalah lies the fundamental aim of the individual experience of theGodhead, or a Unio Mystica.96 It is this fundamental aim that links thetwo traditions together in a functional manner. Both traditions center on"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"93The Craft Degrees of Freemasonr ya direct identification with, or experience of the Godhead. With this inmind, the masonic adoption of the zoharic theme of the loss of knowl-edge whereby the Lord’s name is being pronounced, becomes moreunderstandable than if the Hiramic legend is being used in a merelymoralistic sense, as is the case in its later versions.To conclude, let us return to the question posed at the outset of thispart. Is the masonic legend of Hiram influenced by kabbalah? As we haveseen, the masonic legend of Hiram centers on the loss of how to pro-nounce the name of the Lord, YHVH. The same topic (centered on theidentical name) is found within the zoharic and Christian Kabbalistic tra-ditions. This might be viewed as a coincidence, albeit a highly odd one,if it weren’t for two important factors. First, the legend of Hiram is themost central and important legend within the masonic system of initiation.Consequently, it is highly unlikely that the content of the legend wouldhave been chosen arbitrarily. On the contrar y, early versions of the legendshow that it centered on an initiatic theme where the candidate was iden-tified with God through Hiram. Which brings us the second factor, namelythe kabbalistic experience of the Godhead. Since the aim of the Masterdegree initiation was not merely moralistic, but rather initiatic in the strictsense of the word, it aimed at the same goal found in kabbalah, that is, aUnio Mystica.97 Adding these factors to the identical theme of the loss ofhow to pronounce the name of the Lord, it becomes fairly safe to assumethat we can trace kabbalah as a theme in the legend of Hiram.Concluding RemarksIn this chapter I have endeavored to trace the development of the Craftdegrees of Freemasonr y during its formative period of the first threedecades of the eighteenth centur y. The publication of Samuel Prichard’sMasonry Dissected in October 1730 marked the end of the developmentfrom a two-degree system to that of a system consisting of three de-grees: Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason. Further-more, I have discussed how early Freemasonr y was perceived by thepublic during this period, with special focus on the identification ofFreemasonr y with Western esotericism. The sources show that it was inparticular with Rosicrucianism that Freemasonr y was linked in the publiceye. The masonic catechisms, however, reveal that references to eso-teric currents on the whole were quite rare, but that the few referencesthat can be found tend to be kabbalistic in nature. In particular, the thirddegree legend of Hiram can, in my opinion, be interpreted as beinginfluenced by the kabbalistic search for the lost way of pronouncing thename of the God."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"94Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationEven though Masonry Dissected was an important factor in imple-menting the three-degree system, it was not until after the establish-ment of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1813 that masonic ritualsbecame standardized in England. In France, on the other hand, attemptsto standardize the rituals occurred much earlier and in 1782 the RiteEcossais Rectifié was standardized, and the Rite Moderne in 1786. Thedevelopment of the Craft degrees after 1730 went through two mainphases. The first phase, covering the period 1737 to 1751, took placemainly in France. The French exposures of this period98 differ from theearlier English exposures primarily through the fact that they are muchmore elaborate and give more information on how the rituals actuallywere performed. Furthermore, they include new features, such as elabo-rate toasting and table procedures, and the use of tracing boards andpasswords. In England, the enormous success of Masonry Dissectedcaused the Grand Lodge to take drastic measures in order to preventnonmasons from sneaking into lodges. One of these measures was thereversal of the degree words. In 1751 a rival Grand Lodge was formedby a number of Irish lodges working in London, which called itself theGrand Lodge of the Antients since they considered themselves as work-ing with older, and thus more genuine, rituals. The Antients referred tothe Premier Grand Lodge as the Moderns in reference to the fact thatthe latter had changed the rituals. The second phase of the developmentof the Craft degrees is illustrated by a number of English exposuresprinted during the period 1760 to 1769.99 These exposures, such as ThreeDistinct Knocks published in 1760 and Jachin and Boaz from 1762 con-tain information about the development of the Craft degrees after 1730.The most significant development of masonic rituals of initiationafter 1730 is not, however, to be found within the Craft degrees.

Eventhough the three Craft degrees continued to be modified and elabo-rated, the basic components and the structure of the degrees was firmlyestablished. It did not take long, however, before new rituals began toappear on the masonic scene. These new rituals were often consideredto be complements to or elaborations of the Craft degrees. In fact, themasonic lodges of the second half of the eighteenth centur y experi-enced a virtual “ritual-boom,” especially in France and the German-speak-ing countries. Many of these new rituals were collected into systems orRites1 and these Rites often competed with each other to ser ve as thesole custodian of what was claimed to be the secret of masonr y.2 TheHigh degrees are often referred to as Red degrees, while the three Craftdegrees in their turn are referred to as Blue degrees. In order to beeligible for the High degrees, the candidate has to be a Master Mason.Templar and Ecossais RitesIn discussing masonic High degrees of the eighteenth centur y, a distinc-tion needs to be made between what is known as the Templar degrees,on the one hand, and the Ecossais (or Scottish) degrees on the otherhand. It has been established that the Ecossais degrees come fromLondon3, whereas the Templar degrees have a French origin.4 Thesetwo types of High degrees are the most characteristic degrees of theeighteenth centur y.595"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"96Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationThe earliest reference to Ecossais or Scottish masonr y in Englandis a “Scots Masters Lodge” held at the Devil’s Tavern, Temple Bar,London in 1733. This lodge met on the second and fourth Monday ofeach month, and the lodge was active until 1736 when it was erasedfrom the list of lodges. In 1735 a total of twelve masons were “made”Scots Masters at the Bear Inn, Bath, Lodge No. 113. Five years later, in1740, there were at least three more references to masons being made,or “rais’d,” Scots Masters.6 Ecossais masonr y appears to have spread tothe Continent at an early stage and references to this type of Highdegree masonr y in Berlin date from at least 1741, and in France fromaround 1743.7While the Ecossais Degrees to a large extent are occupied with theconstruction of a new Temple (an implicitly Christian theme), the TemplarDegrees center on the legend that Freemasonr y derived from the me-dieval Knights Templar. The order of the Knights Templar, founded inthe first decade of the twelfth centur y, was disbanded by Philip IV “TheFair” of Bourbon (1268–1314) and Pope Clement V (1264–1314) in thefirst decade of the fourteenth centur y, but according to a masonic leg-end the Templars sur vived in the highlands of Scotland and later reap-peared to the public as the Order of Freemasons. The first person topresent this theor y of continuation was the Scotsman Chevalier AndrewMichael Ramsey (1686–1743) who lived as an expatriate in Paris. Ramsaywas the orator of the lodge Le Louis d’Argent, whose Worshipful Masterwas Charles Radclyffe (1693–1746). In a famous oration given at thelodge in 1737, Ramsay stated that Freemasonr y was founded bythe medieval crusaders in the Holy Land, or Outremer.8 He did notexplicitly identify the crusaders who, allegedly, founded Freemasonr y asbeing the Knights Templar, but as Pierre Mollier has pointed out, theidentification of the Crusaders with the Templars was not far away:A partir du moment où l’on établissait un rapport entre Franc-Maçonnerie et Chevalerie, de surcroit si cette Chevalerie étaitcelle des croisades, les Templiers n’étaient plus loin! En fait, ilsapparaissant déjà en filigrane dans le Discours de Ramsay. Eneffet, dans le contexte des croisades, à qui d’autre qu’auxTempliers peut s’appliquer la défense de « Cette promesse sacrée[qui] n’étoit pas un serment exécrable, comme on le débite »?9Ramsey’s oration proved to be a milestone in the development of masonicrituals of initiation and soon rituals began to appear that incorporatedRamsey’s thesis. It was in the milieu of the Jacobite Parisian Lodges thatthe masonic Templar degrees first developed, perhaps as early as 1737.10"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"97High or Additional Degrees of Freemasonr yThe best-known propagator of Templar degrees in Germany was BaronKarl Gotthelf von Hund (1722–1776), and it is often claimed that he hadbeen initiated into a Templar degree in France in 1743.11 On the basis ofthis initiation, he set up the Rite of the Strict Observance, which consistedof three additional degrees: Scottish Master, Novice, and Knight Templaror Knight of the Temple. The name of the Rite had “the double meaningof following strictly the rules of the Order as well as distinguishing itfrom the then current German Freemasonr y.”12 Von Hund furthermoreintroduced a peculiar feature in the structure of his Rite, namely that ofthe Unknown Superiors or Superiores Incogniti.13 These Unknown Supe-riors ruled, through von Hund, the Rite of the Strict Observance, and themembers of the Rite were expected to strictly obser ve the decrees ofthese superiors. It has been suggested that the actual head of the Ritewas none other than the young pretender Bonnie Prince Charlie, CharlesEdward Stuart (1720–1788). The political implications for masonr y (es-pecially in connection with the Scottish Rites) during the eighteenthcentur y have been the subject of much debate and speculations. Al-though it is clear that many Jacobite exiles were active in masonic lodges,it remains an open question to what extent Jacobite interests actuallyshaped masonic rituals of initiation.14 In 1772 the Strict Observance mergedwith the so-called Clerics (Klerikat) created by Johann August Starck(1741–1816), but this agreement ended in 1778. Four year later, in 1782,theStrict Observance was of ficially brought to an end at the Convent ofWilhelmsbad and replaced by the Rectified Scottish Rite (see below).Many of the High degree Rites that were founded during the eigh-teenth centur y have passed into oblivion, but there still remain a num-ber of important Rites to this day. The most important of these are theAncient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the Rectified Scottish Rite, and theSwedish Rite. By far the largest of these Rites in terms of the number ofinitiates is the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite (AASR), which has atotal of thirty-three degrees including the three Craft degrees.15 The Riteis a collection of French eighteenth-centur y rituals and it contains bothEcossais and Templar degrees.16 There are also other influences such aschivalr y, alchemy, and Rosicrucianism.17 The Rosicrucian symbolism ismostly concentrated in the eighteenth degree, Knight Rose-Croix, whilethe twenty-eighth degree, Knight of the Sun, contains alchemical sym-bolism.18 In 1801 the Scottish Rite was officially founded in Charleston,South Carolina (Table 5.1).TheRectified Scottish Rite was founded around 1774 by Jean-BaptisteWillermoz (1730–1824), a tradesman in silk living in L yons.19 Willermozhad become a mason in 1750 and six years later he founded the lodge“Parfaite Amitie,” which was constituted by the Grand Loge de France."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"98Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationIn 1767 he was initiated into L’Ordre des Élus Coëns (see below) and in1773 into the already mentioned Rite of the Strict Observance. The ritualsof the Rectified Scottish Rite developed, from the “rather crude” ritualsof the Strict Observance, over a span of some thirty-four years from 1775to 1809.20 The main object of the rituals is said to be the “progressiverevelation of the theosophical doctrine and teachings of Martines dePasqually” who had founded L’Ordre des Élus Coëns.21 It seems thatWillermoz remained faithful to the teachings of Martines de PasquallyTable 5.1.

In fact, L’Ordre des Élus Coëns functioned asan inner order of the Rectified Scottish Rite, or as a “masonr y beyondmasonr y.”22 Today, the Rite is active in Switzerland, France, and Bel-gium, and it is explicitly Christian in character. The majority of lodgesbelonging to the Rectified Scottish Rite no longer practice the two high-est degrees: Professed and Grand Professed (Table 5.2).TheSwedish Rite is the name given to a Rite practiced inScandinavia and Germany.23 The degree system consists of a total ofeleven degrees, with the last degree restricted to a limited numberof initiates (as the case is with most masonic Rites). The Grand Masterof the Rite is called the Vicar of Solomon. As a system, this Rite isparticularly unified as the rituals of the individual degrees are closelyinterconnected with each other.24Freemasonr y was introduced in Sweden as early as 1735, when thefirst lodge was established in Stockholm by Count Axel Wrede-Sparre(1708–1772).25 Wrede-Sparre had been initiated by Charles Radclyffe,Earl of Der wentwater (1693–1746), in Paris in 1731. Six years later, thatis, in the same year that Ramsay delivered his famous oration, 1737,Radclyffe gave the Swedish mason Carl Fredrik Scheffer (1715–1786) acharter to open lodges in Sweden. In 1756 the first St. Andrews Lodge,L’Innocente, was founded in Stockholm by Carl Fredrik Eckleff (1723–1786).26 It worked a fourth and fifth degree. Three years later, 1759,Eckleff founded the first chapter, which worked the sixth to the ninthdegrees.27 These degrees eventually became part of the Swedish Rite.Eckleff was instrumental in shaping what eventually developed into theSwedish Rite and it is often assumed that it was he who firmly imple-mented a Christian basis for the rituals. However, the rituals were ofFrench origin and it was only around 1800 that Freemasonr y was openedto Jews in France. It is therefore naturally assumed in the Constitutionsissued by Radclyffe that Freemasonr y was to be Christian in Sweden.Eckleff’s system was further developed by Duke Carl of Södermanland(1748–1818), later King Carl XIII, who revised the rituals in c. 1780 andc. 1800 (Table 5.3).Table 5.2.

This form of masonr y did not place the origins of theOrder of Freemasons with the medieval crusades but instead in ancientEgypt.28 Ever since the Renaissance, Egypt had been seen as the cradleof Western civilization, and during the latter part of the eighteenth cen-tur y a virtual “egyptomania” flourished.29 This was enhanced even morewith Napoleon’s militar y campaign in Egypt and the vast amounts ofEgyptian artifacts subsequently brought back to France by French offic-ers. Perhaps the most important of these objects was the Rosetta Stone,which was found in 1799 at Rosetta (Rashid), east of Alexandria. In 1822Jean-François Champollion managed to decipher the ancient Egyptianhieroglyphs with the help of this stone.Although Egyptian masonr y never became a real challenge to thepredominance of the other forms of High degree masonr y, it has re-mained on the fringes of regular masonr y to this day.

It is clear that the foremost propagators of Egyptian ma-sonr y, from the eighteenth centur y to the twentieth, were part of theWestern esoteric movement.One of the earliest propagators of Egyptian masonr y was KarlFriedrich von Köppen (1734–1797) who founded the Order of theAfrikanische Bauherren in 1767.31 This order was based on a short textby Köppen and Bernhard Hymmen (1731–1787), entitled Crata Repoa.32In this text, the authors presented an alternative histor y of Freemasonr yin which the first Grand Master was identified as the biblical Ham, whohad immigrated to Egypt and there taken the name Menes. In EgyptMenes received a secret knowledge, which has been passed on andpreser ved by generations of Freemasons all the way to the eighteenthcentur y. Allegedly, the Order of the Afrikanische Bauherren was basedon this secret knowledge. The Rite comprised a total of eleven degreesdivided into three groups or Temples.Another influential system was Cagliostro’s Egyptian Rite, whichwas founded in Naples in 1777, with a Supreme Council established inParis in 1785.33 Allesandro di Cagliostro (ps. of Guiseppe Balsamo 1743–1795), was one of the most famous and charismatic adventurers of theeighteenth centur y. He claimed to have been initiated at the pyramidsin Egypt and he asserted that he possessed the knowledge to trans-mute base metals into silver and gold. Other claims included the abil-ity to evoke spirits, and that he had lived for no less than two thousandyears. In 1785 he announced that both men and women should beentitled to the mysteries of the pyramids, and he thus opened his Riteto women.34 Cagliostro’s preoccupation with esoteric matters appar-ently found its way into the initiator y system of his Egyptian Rite, andthe Rite included alchemical aspects, the search for a spiritual immor-tality, and angelic theurgy.35The most famous of all the Egyptian Rites, and certainly the mostinfluential ones, were the Misraim and Memphis Rites. The first of theseRites, the Rite of Misraim, was founded around 1805 in Milan by theFrenchman Lechangeur (d. 1812). It is said that his reason for foundingthis Rite was that he was denied access to the higher degrees of theAncient and Accepted Scottish Rite (AASR).36 He therefore decided tocreate his own order, which he claimed would be superior to the AASR.It is possible that there is some historical truth to this stor y, as Egyptianmasonr y was largely a reaction against the Ecossais and Templar Rites.The order was called the Rite of Misraim in reference to the order-legend about the son of the biblical Ham, Misraim. According to this"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"102Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationlegend, Misraim had a profound part in shaping the religion of ancientEgypt—it was none other than Misraim who was the originator of thesecret tradition of Isis and Osiris. Furthermore, the wisdom preser vedwithin the sanctuar y of the Rite was claimed to derive from Adam, whohad received it directly from God.37A few years later the order came into the hands of three brothersfrom Avignon, Marc, Michael, and Joseph Bedarride, and it was undertheir leadership that the order was introduced in France in 1815. TheBedarride brothers tried to get the Rite recognized by the ruling masonicbody in France, the Grand Orient. The Rite was comparatively success-ful for a couple of years and a number of lodges were established through-out France. Internal strife, however, put a stop to further expansion andin 1817 the Supreme Council of the Rite was formally disbanded.38 Vari-ous lodges nevertheless continued to work the degrees of the Rite. TheRite consisted of a total of ninety degrees, divided into four series, whichwere further subdivided into seventeen classes. The four series werecalled Symbolic, Philosophic, Mystic, and Kabbalistic.39In 1833 Jacques-Étienne Marconis de Nègre (1795–1868) joinedtheRite of Misraim in Paris, but he was excluded from the Rite a fewmonths later. He then moved to L yons where in 1836 he founded alodge of the Rite of Misraim, using another name. The Bedarride broth-ers apparently did not suspect that the founder of this lodge was thesame person who had been excluded a few years earlier in Paris. In May1838, however, Marconis was expelled once again from the Rite. Thistime, instead of rejoining under a different name, he set up his ownEgyptian masonic Rite—the Rite of Memphis.40 This Rite consisted of 96degrees, with a 97th degree reser ved for the head of the Order, calledthe Grand Hierophant 97°.41 Marconis managed to set up lodges of theRite in Paris, Belgium, and Great Britain (where a Grand Lodge of theRite was established). In 1856 Marconis traveled to New York where heinstituted a Grand Lodge of the Rite, called the “Disciples of Memphis.”After a few years Harr y J. Seymour became the head of the Rite in theU.S., and in 1867 he reformed the initiator y system of the Rite andreduced the number of degrees from 96 to 33. A few years later the Ritewas (re-)imported to Europe via John Yarker (who established a Sover-eign Grand Sanctuar y in 1872), and eventually formed the basis for theOrdo Templi Orientis. In Italy, the Rite of Memphis and the Rite of Misraimmerged into one system around 1881 through the endeavors of GuiseppeGaribaldi (1807–1882), under the name Rite of Memphis and Misraim.42There are today a large number organizations that claim to representthe Rites of Memphis and Misraim."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"103High or Additional Degrees of Freemasonr y“Esoteric” Freemasonr yMasonic Rites of a more outspoken esoteric bent included Rites andorders such as L’Orde des Élus Coëns and the Rite Ecossais philosophique,but Rosicrucian Rites and degrees can also be included in this categor y.The first of these, L’Orde des Élus Coëns, or the Order of the MasonicKnights Élus Coëns of the Universe, was founded by the theosophist andkabbalist Martines de Pasqually (1708/1709–1774) in the 1760s and itincluded a peculiar form of theurgy mixed with the philosophy and the-osophy of its founder.43 Although this order possessed all the outwardcharacteristics of a masonic organization such as a hierarchical degreesystem, rituals of initiation, lodges, and employed a typical masonic ter-minology, it is perhaps more fitting to label L’Orde des Élus Coëns as areligious movement. The reason for this is not only the peculiar reli-gious teachings derived from Pasqually but also the marked religiouslife that the members were expected to live, which is referred to in thename of the order: “chosen priests,” from the Hebrew Kohen, meaningpriest. Pasqually’s teachings center round the gnosticidea of the Fall ofMan through which humankind became separated from God. Throughthe initiator y system of the order the members were expected to re-verse the Fall and make an upward journey in which the seven degreesof the order (not counting the three Craft degrees) corresponded to theseven gifts of the Spirit. The final goal of the initiator y process was“reintegration,” a return to the primitive and primordial state of mancharacterized by union with God. The theurgy employed in the orderwas a means to this goal, through which divine energies were invokedand the communion with good spirits was sought. According to Jean-François Var this theurgy was not aimed at acquiring natural or super-natural powers, and it was part of a religious “cult,” which included aliturgy.44 As mentioned, the initiator y system of the order consisted of atotal of ten degrees, of which the preliminar y Craft degrees were notseen as part of the Order as such. The degrees were divided into fourdifferent classes (again, not counting the Craft degrees), with the de-gree of Réau-Croix as the highest degree, which constituted a class ofits own. After the death of Pasqually in 1774 Caignet de Lester (1725–1778) succeeded him as leader of the order (Grand Souverain de l’Ordre),followed by Sebastian de Las Casas in 1778. Although L’Orde des ÉlusCoëns was formally dissolved in 1781 it continued to have active lodges,most notably the one in L yons under the leadership of Willermoz.45TheRite Ecossais philosophique was the successor of an esoteric RitecalledRite Hermétique d’Avignon, founded in 1774.46 According to Snoek:"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"104Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationThe Rite Hermétique was in fact created in the lodge Saint Jeand’Ecosse in Marseille, where some members of the lodge, whichwas founded in 1774 in Avignon, received its degrees, and it wasthis lodge of Marseille that constituted the lodge Saint Jeand’Ecosse in Avignon on 31 July 1774.47In 1776 the Rite Hermétique was exported from Avignon to Paris,where it changed its name to Rite Ecossais philosophique. The histor y ofthe development of the degree system48 of the Rite Ecossais philosophiqueis a complicated matter in itself, but suffice to say that the list offeredinCollectanea(which I use as my primar y source for the True Masonritual), corresponds with a list made by Thor y for the Rite in 1766 (sic!)(Table 5.4).49 Obviously, the date of the list is an error, since the Rite didnot even exist then.50 It is uncertain when the Rite was dissolved, but itprobably occurred sometime between 1844 and 1849.51 The Rite Ecossaisphilosophique is a good example of the more alchemically orientedmasonic systems of the eighteenth centur y as will be evident to thereader from the degree of True Mason or Académie des Vrais Maçons,analyzed later in this chapter.Finally, mention should be made of the so-called Rosicrucian de-grees and Rites, which also appeared on the masonic scene during theeighteenth centur y. The prime characteristic trait of this type of degreesand Rites is that they allude in different ways to the Rosicrucian move-ment of the seventeenth centur y. As discussed in chapter 3, a RosicrucianFraternity never existed as described in the Rosicrucian manifestos butthe idea of such a fraternity nevertheless became popular during theseventeenth centur y. It did not take long before masonr y was seen aslinked to Rosicrucianism. For instance, in The Muses Threnodie (1638)the “Brethren of the Rosie Cross” are described as being in possessionof the Mason Word. It needs to be emphasized, however, that the masonicRosicrucian degrees differ considerably both in content and in their rela-tion to seventeenth-centur y Rosicrucianism. In order to simplify matters,most (but not all) of the masonic Rosicrucian degrees and Rites of theeighteenth centur y were focused on alchemy, whereas later Rosicruciandegrees and Rites are more focused on Christian Mysticism.Table 5.4.

This Rite was a masonic offshoot of an alchemical brother-hood called Der Orden des Gülden und Rosenkreutzes founded in 1710.52The Rosicrucianism of Der Orden des Gold- und Rosenkreuzes was heavilyinfused with alchemy53 but there was also a political aspect to the Order.Many, if not most, of the masonic Craft lodges of the eighteenth centur ycherished the ideals of the Enlightenment, whereas the High degreeRites often were more ambivalent regarding these ideals. The membersofDer Orden des Gold- und Rosenkreuzes were to a large extent conser-vative in their outlook, and the Order can be seen, to a certain extent,as part of the anti-Aufklärung movement active in the German-speakingworld during the second half of the eighteenth centur y.54Apart from the pursuit of alchemical knowledge, another impor-tant characteristic drew people to the new Rosicrucian order: itspolitical stance. Rosicrucianism in the late 18th centur y becamea rallying point for those who were of conser vative outlook andwho were opposed to the socially radical, rationalistic, and evenanti-religious tendencies which were becoming a serious chal-lenge in Germany.55The Order was comparatively successful and lodges were established inthe German-speaking countries, Austria, Hungar y, and northern Italy.56Its success was due not only to the fact that the order functioned as a“conser vative focal point,” but also because it stressed the importanceof religion in times when anti-religious sentiments were popular in cer-tain parts of society. Furthermore, the German character of the Orderappealed to persons of a nationalistic orientation. The Order also claimedto possess a secret knowledge (alchemy), which was restricted to itsinitiates.57 The initiator y system of Der Orden des Gold- und Rosenkreuzesconsisted of nine degrees, and one had to be a Master Mason in orderto be eligible to join the order.58Table 5.5.

It consists of two High de-grees: the Order of Heredom of Kilwinning, and the Knights of the RosyCross. The first of these two degrees gives further explanations of thethree Craft degrees, while that of the Knights of the Rosy Cross ischaracterized by Christian mysticism veiled in Rosicrucian symbolism.According to a legendar y histor y of the Order,61 the Royal Order ofScotland was founded by King Robert the Bruce (1274–1329) in 1314 tocommemorate the assistance he received at the battle of Bannockburn onJune 24, 1314 from sixty-three Knights Templar. The Knights Templarhad showed up unexpectedly at a crucial point of the battle and assistedRobert the Bruce to defeat the English forces of Edward II (1284–1327).The defeat ensured the independence of Scotland until the union of 1707.The eighteenth degree of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, Rose-Croix of Heredom, Knight of the Pelican and Eagle, is probably the mostwell-known and practiced of all the masonic Rosicrucian degrees. Eventhough the histor y of this degree reaches back to the middle ofeighteenth-centur y France, it differs considerably in content from othereighteenth-centur y masonic Rosicrucian Rites such as Der Orden desGold- und Rosenkreuzes.62 In 1768 a masonic body was founded in Paris,which called itself the First Sovereign Chapter Rose Croix, and in thestatutes, which it issued a year later it is stated that “The knights of RoseCroix are called knights of the Eagle, of the Pelican, Sovereigns of RoseCroix, perfect Prince Masons free of Heredon.”63 The Eagle and thePelican are symbols of Christ, which alludes to the Christian nature ofthe degree. The name Heredon, more commonly spelled as Heredom,and sometimes as Harodim,64 is the name given to a mythical mountainsupposed to exist north of Kilwinning, Scotland.65 According to a masonicmyth, associated particularly with Ecossais masonr y, the masons weredriven away after the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem and sub-sequently found their way to this mountain in Scotland. They remainedon this mountain until the time of the Crusades.Rosicrucian degrees thus fall into two main categories, alchemicaland Christian, but it needs to be emphasized that there are no clear-cutborders between the two categories.

As a ritual, the degree of a True Mason, or Académiedes Vrais Maçons, is not particularly elaborate or impressive. Neverthe-less, it includes parts that are deeply saturated with Western esotericism,particularly in the form of alchemy and, to a lesser extent, kabbalah.66These parts are concentrated in a discourse delivered by the SeniorSage or Sur veillant, in the explanation of the tracing board, and in theinstruction in the form of a catechism.The ritual takes place in a lodge, called the Academy, and it is per-formed by three main officers, called Most Wise,67 and Senior and JuniorSages, respectively. The Academy is illuminated by three candles placedon the tracing board. The dominant colors of the ritual are black, white,and red; the walls are draped in black, there should be white and redcolumns, the gloves and the cordons should be white, black, and red.68Given the alchemical nature of this ritual, these colors probably refer tothe three stages of the alchemical process: Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo.The Academy is opened in the ordinar y fashion of masonic ritualsof initiation. That is, the chief officer, in this case the Most Wise, asksthe two Sur veillants or Sages whether the lodge room is properlyguarded, and if all present are True Masons. The Academy is thenproclaimed to be opened, and one of the brethren, called Sage Academi-cians, is asked to give a lecture on a chosen subject. It is then an-nounced by the Senior Sur veillant that a reception is to be made: “MostWise, there is a philosopher mason in the preparation chamber, whomthe Academy has deemed worthy of being admitted among us.”69The candidate, who has been waiting in a chamber of prepara-tion,70 is divested of all metals, and has his hat, coat, and shoes removed.The sleeves of his shirt are rolled up, his hands are tied behind hisback, and finally he is blindfolded. After the usual questions and knockon the door, the candidate is admitted to the lodge room where he is ledto the West, facing the Most Wise in the East. There is an “earthenwarevessel, into which are poured wine spirits, mercur y and salt. These areto be lighted and furnish the only illumination on the academy.”71 Thecandidate is asked what he desires, and after answering that he wantsto be admitted to the Academy, if he is found worthy, the Academiciansindicate their consent to his request by rapping once on the floor withtheir rods, which they are holding.The candidate is then, in the customar y fashion of masonic rituals,led around the lodge. These perambulations, which are three in number,"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"108Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationare made in a circle, a square and a triangle. When the perambulationsare completed, the blindfold is removed, and the candidate is caused tosee the earthen vessel with the fire. After four minutes, he is conductedto the foot of the throne of the Most Wise, and there caused to kneel.The candidate then takes the obligation in this kneeling position. Thisobligation is a comparatively short and simple one:I, . . . . . . . , promise on my word of honor, and under penalty ofhaving my lips sealed and my bowels cut open, never to revealeither directly or indirectly, to anyone at all, and under anypretext, the mysteries which I will behold, and may the GreatJehovah be my strong and holy guide.72The candidate is then declared a True Mason by the Most Wise, andinstructed in the traditional secrets of the degree, that is, the sacredword, the password, the name, the grip, the age, the step, and finally thebatter y. Of these secrets, perhaps the most significant are the sacredword and the password—Jehovah and Metralon,73 respectively. The MostWise proceeds to present the candidate with the apron, gloves, and awand. The candidate is led to the tracing board, where he gives a dis-course he has prepared beforehand.When the candidate has finished his discourse, the Most Wiseresponds with a discourse of his own. This discourse begins by statingthat the degree of True Mason was created at the time when God broughtorder out of chaos, and that the degree includes the principles of allother degrees. There have been many Adepts over the centuries, butsome of them have been led astray. The profanes who criticize thatwhich they do not understand, “who are lacking a keen mind and indus-trious hand, (. . .) will lose for themselves all the joys of discovery andlabor; and scorn all that they do not possess, power of imagination andcourage of doing.” The Most Wise continues by urging the brethren toabandon the profanes, or “these off-springs of darkness” and enemies totheir own hatred of their vain and inconsequential idea.For us true children of light, and sincere friends of humanity,who see in those instructions and the practice, the clear an-nouncement of truth, there will be at last the pleasures whichresult therefrom.74The discourse ends with a promise that the brethren will guide and helpthe candidate in “the science,” by explaining the obstacles placed in hispath and assisting him in his studies. There is also an exhortation to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"109High or Additional Degrees of Freemasonr yfollow in the footsteps of “that great man, whose presence is so dear anduseful to us, and whose memor y will always be precious to us.” Oneplausible suggestion is that this refers to Hiram, or perhaps Christ.Upon the completion of the discourse, the Senior Sur veillant proceedsto explain the symbolism of the tracing board.You will see first, wise academician, in the upper part of thetableau a radiant and capital “J” in the middle.The triangle represents God in the three persons, and thecapital “J” is the initial of the ineffable name of the Great Archi-tect of the Universe.75The ineffable name of the Great Architect indicated by the letter J is, ofcourse, Jehovah, that is, the sacred word of the degree. As discussed inchapter 4, Jehovah or , is the old Master’s Word, which was lost atthe time of Hiram’s death.The shadowy circle signifies the world which God created; thecross within it represents the light by means of which He willdevelop it.The square, the four elements which developed in it.The triangle, the three principles, which the mixture ofthe four elements produced. The circle is surrounded by thewaters which God has placed above the firmament.76The reference to the cross is one of the few direct references to Chris-tianity to be found in the ritual. The passage also explains why theperambulations that the candidate had to undergo during the ritual werein the shape of a circle, square, and a triangle. The four elements refer,of course, to the antique idea that all matter is constituted by four ele-ments,viz. earth, water, air, and fire.77 This idea continued as a basiccomponent of alchemical theor y long after orthodox science had dis-carded it. The three principles refer to the alchemical principles of sul-fur, mercur y, and salt (discussed later in this chapter).The starr y circle designates the firmament.The other circle with the signs and the planets representsthe Zodiac.78According to the Ptolemaic worldview, the earth is the center of theuniverse, and around this centre there are seven planetar y spheres inwhich the seven planets of antiquity (the Moon, Mercur y, Venus, the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"110Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationSun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) move. The movement of the planets wasconsidered to be caused by the Primum Mobile, located either at, orbeyond, the firmament of the stars. It is this firmament that is referredto in the previous passage.The cross which surmounts them signifies that as God throughhis great power created the universe, so through his benefi-cence he redeemed it.The four figures which surround it are the emblems of theatmosphere and the four winds.Man, the sun, the plants which one sees on the surface ofthe earth are the image of the three divisions of nature, that is,the animal, the mineral and the vegetable, which through themedium of the primal fire and of the central fire, that the greatarchitect placed in continual agitation, come to their perfection.79It is specifically stated in the bylaws of the degree that no mason maybe admitted, without being “Christian, pious, discreet and wise.”80 Al-though the Christian elements of the ritual are almost nonexistent, it issignificant to note that as a rule, High degree systems tend to be limitedto Christian members. It is therefore quite natural to find a reference tothe cross in the ritual. Further, the division of nature into the animal,mineral, and vegetable worlds derives from Aristotle. The primal andcentral fires most likely refer to the two different types of fire oftenencountered in alchemical literature.81The two uppermost letters signify that God created those whichstand below; that nature produces and that art multiplies.On the altar of perfumes, we note the fire which is givento matter; the two towers are the two furnaces, wet and dr y,through which we must travel.The tube which is in the furnaces, ser ves to give the tem-perature of the fire produced by charcoal of oak trees. The firewill well consume the philosopher’s stone. Below we see therod for stirring the fire.And the two figures surmounted by a cross, are nothingother than the two vases of nature and of that royal art, in whichone may cause a double marriage of the white woman and thered ser vant, from which marriage there will be born a mostpowerful king.82This part of the explanation of the tracing board is entirely devoted toalchemical imager y. The two furnaces, described as wet and dr y, through"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"111High or Additional Degrees of Freemasonr ywhich “we must travel” is a direct reference to the alchemical formulaofSolve et Coagula, discussed later. The furnace itself is an importantsymbol, as it is thought that the metal undergoes its mortification andsubsequent purification within a furnace, or athanor as it is usually called.The furnace is furthermore often identified with the fire that causes themortification of the metal. It is significant that the coal is specified asbeing of oak trees, as the oak is a name for the philosophical tree.83 Thephilosophical tree symbolizes the entire alchemical process, from basemetal to gold, or from unenlightened to enlightened soul. Thephilosopher’s stone is probably the most well-known of all alchemicalsymbols, and its primar y import is the completion or the crowning ofthe alchemical work. As such, it is considered to possess a number ofqualities, such as the ability to transmute metals, cure diseases, prolonglife, and to rejuvenate. “Royal art” was the name given to alchemy (butas shown in chapter 4, it was also a name given to Freemasonr y), asgold was considered to be the royal metal. A further reference to the“royal” nature of the alchemical process is the “most powerful king” thatwill be born out of the marriage between the “white woman” and the“red ser vant.” The white woman and the red ser vant stand for the fe-male and male principles, respectively. The king is another symbol forthe philosopher’s stone—the goal of the alchemical quest.Completion of the explanation of the tracing board is followed bythe instruction, which is in the form of a catechism. In French masoniceighteenth-centur y rituals, catechisms used to be practiced at the endof the ritual (just before closing the lodge), or at the table lodge afterthe initiation. The instruction is of utmost importance because it notonly touches on symbols encountered in the ritual, but more impor-tantly also shows exactly the kind of alchemy with which the membersof the degree were expected to be familiar. The catechism begins withthe following question:Q.—Who is your father?A.—Hermes.84Hermes was, of course, seen as the mythical founding father of alchemy,and the above question can therefore be interpreted as that the candi-date, being an alchemist, is thereby a “child” of Hermes.85Q.—Did you receive the light?A.—Verily, Most Wise, the three principles were explained to me.Q.—Do you know how to proceed with your labors?"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"112Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationA.—Verily, Most Wise, I know how to stir with the rod, to manipu-late the materials and to seal the vapours against esscape [sic!].86Receiving the light is a recurrent theme in masonic rituals of initiation,but in this context the light probably refers to the knowledge of thealchemical process, as the answer indicates that the light is connectedto the knowledge of the three principles. The three principles, in theirturn, refer to the three alchemical principles sulfur, mercur y, and salt.The manipulation of the materials, or metals, is a direct allusion to thepractice of alchemy. Furthermore, the sealing of the vapors from escapeis a reference to the usage of hermetically sealed vessels in alchemy.Q.—What is the significance of the ten knocks you gave on yourentr y into the academy?A.—It is the perfect number.Q.—Why do you say that ten is the perfect number?A.—Because ten comprehends all the faith and unity of God bywhom all was created, as well as chaos from which all that exists,was produced. Furthermore, he who would be quite happy tounderstand that which is the basic number of formal arithmetic,and to understand the nature of the prime spherical number whichis the half of the ten, will know, says Pic de Mirandole, the secretof the fifty doors of learning of the great fifty years of this genera-tion, as well as the ruler of similar cycles, which the Cabalists call“Ensopht,” or Divinity itself, unadorned.87In Christian and Jewish Kabbalah alike, the number ten is seen as a“perfect number” as it contains God’s entire creation in the form of theten Sephiroth. The reference to “Ensopht” constitutes the unlimitedGodhead, Ain Soph, from which the Tree of Life with its ten Sephirothemanates. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) was the first toseek evidence in the Kabbalah for the “truth” of Christianity, and thusinspired later kabbalists such as Johannes Reuchlin. Pico included hisKabbalistic arguments for the authenticity of Christianity in hisConclusiones (1486), a collection of nine hundred questions and answers.88The book was, however, suppressed by the pope.Q.—Explain the meaning of your jewel, the colors of the ribbon aswell as what is attached; the cross and the two letters on the flapof you apron; as well as the sun in the center; the letters which areon the two sides and the two red stripes with which it is bordered."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"113High or Additional Degrees of Freemasonr yA.—The jewel is the representation of mercur y, sulphur and salt.The colors of the ribbon and gloves represent the three principalcolors which are apparent in the civil government.The cross on the flap of the apron is the Light, the two lettersrepresent the True Mason.The sun represents gold, the two letters, the meaning already given.Finally the poppy-red color with which the apron is bordered des-ignates the perfection of the philosopher’s stone as black denotesputrification and white sublimity.89The reference to the three colors black, white, and red refers to thethree stages in the alchemical process; nigredo,albedo, and rubedo.90 Inthe initial or black state the impure metal is killed or putrefied, that is,it is dissolved into its original form, or Prima Materia. According toalchemical theor y, there can be no regeneration without corruption, nolife without death. This state of dissolution, or mortification, is oftensymbolized in alchemical imager y with symbols of death and corrup-tion, such as skeletons, skulls, and coffins. In the second or white phasethe blackened matter is purified by the mercurial water, the universalagent of transmutation. “The body has been whitened and spiritualized(i.e., the fixed is volatilized) and the soul has been prepared to receiveillumination from the spirit. This is the stage at which the alchemistachieves the white stone and the white elixir which has the power totransmute all imperfect metals to silver.”91 This stage can also be inter-preted as the spirit’s separation from the body, which will reunite whenthe body is purified and made pure and spotless. This stage is oftensymbolized by things pure, white, or silver, such as the moon, snow, andvirgins. Finally, in the third or red stage, the spirit is reunited with thewhite matter. This union is often described as a “chemical wedding,” andupon its completion the desirable Philosophers’ Stone is achieved. Im-ages such as red lions, basilisks, red roses, and the sun often symbolizetherubedo phase of the opus alchymicum.92Q.—Do you know how to make the universal matter?A.—I do, Most Wise.Q.—From what do you produce it?A.—Eternal and internal fire.Q.—What does it result in?A.—The four elements, which are said to be the main principles."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"114Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationQ.—What are they?A.—Fire, air, water and earth.Q.—What are their qualities?A.—Heat, drought, cold and moisture, the first two coupled withthe latter two, bring to the earth the drought and cold.Water has cold and moisture.Air has moisture and heat, fire has heat and drought, which are allunited on earth, because the elements are circulated like the windof our father Hermes.93As Abraham states, the idea of the four elements was derived fromEmpedocles (494–432 BC) and Plato’s Timaeus (c. 360 BC), but came toalchemy through Aristotle’s theories of matter.94 All matter ultimatelyderives from a prima materia, and the four elements are the forms inwhich it manifests itself.95 The four elements are not simply the ordinar yfire, air, water, and earth in nature, but abstract principles, which ema-nate from the prima materia. The alchemical process of transmutation,oropus alchymicum, is based on the fundamental theor y that all materialobjects and matter consist of various proportions of the four elementsand that these proportions can be manipulated. However, in order tocause this manipulation, it is first necessar y to “kill” (the nigredo phase)the original form of the matter one wishes to transmute. The answer tothe question of what the qualities of the four elements are displaysfurther familiarity with basic concepts of alchemy: there are four quali-ties connected to the elements—hot, dr y, cold, and moist.96 Each of theelements has two of these qualities; fire has hot and dr y, air has hot andmoist, water has cold and moist, and finally earth has cold and dr y.Q.—What does the mxture [sic!] of the four elements and theirfour qualities of which ever ything is formed, produce?A.—The three main principles.Q.—What names are given them?A.—Mercur y, sulphur and salt.Q.—What do you mean by mercur y, sulphur and salt?A.—The philosophical, and not the commonly known, mercur y,sulphur and salt.Q.—What is the philosophical mercur y?"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"115High or Additional Degrees of Freemasonr yA.—It is a liquid and spirit which dissolves and refines the sun.Q.—What is philosophical sulphur?A.—It is fire and a spirit which destroys and colors that fire.Q.—What is philosophical salt?A.—It is a mineral and a substance which congeals and fixes, andaccomplishes all this through the medium of the atmosphere.97The three main principles of metals mentioned above were first pro-posed by Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541).98 According to this theor y, all metals are constituted by threemain principles; mercur y (the spirit), sulfur (the soul), and salt (thebody).99 Mercur y and salt, or spirit and body, are seen as two contraries,which are united by the mediating principle of sulfur, that is, the soul.Paracelsus’ theor y of the tria prima, or the first three principles, differsfrom earlier medieval alchemy in which the metals were considered toderive from two principles, namely sulfur, and mercur y.100 Sulfur wasconsidered to be the male principle, or hot, dr y, and active seed, whereasmercur y was seen as the feminine principle with its cold, moist, andpassive qualities. These two principles were connected to the well-knownalchemical formula of Solve et Coagula, dissolve and coagulate. Thisformula, known already by the Greek alchemists, illustrates the funda-mental practice of alchemy; that is, the converting of a solid body intoa fluid substance (solve), and the opposite process of turning a fluid intoa dr y solid body (coagula). The process was to be repeated time andagain, and each time the matter to be transmuted was considered tobecome purer. Mercur y was connected to the solve aspect of the formulaand was thus attributed to the power of dissolving fixed matter; whilesulfur was considered to possess the power of fixing and coagulating thevolatile substance, and thus to be connected to the second, or coagula,part of the formula. Furthermore, the mercur y often encompassed thetwo elements of water and earth, while sulfur encompassed air and water.Q.—How are these obtained from three principles?A.—The four elements redoubled, as Hermes said, or the greatelements, accordingly to Raymond Lully, which are Mercur y, sul-phur, salt and glass. The former two act like volatiles, the onebeing like water and the other like air (or oil), and flee fire whichcauses the one to be driven off and the other to be consumed. Theremaining two substances however being solid and dr y, are notaffected by fire. The salt defies the heat of fire while glass, or pure"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"116Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationearth is not affected except to be melted and refined. Becauseeach element has two qualities the great or redoubled elements,that is to say, mercur y, sulphur, salt and glass consist of two of thesimple elements, or in other words, each of the four has two ele-ments in different proportions. Mercur y has more water than isusually attributed to it; oil or sulphur, more air; the salt has morefire; and glass has more earth. Earth is at last found pure andclean at the center of all the elementar y compounds, and it isultimately freed from all the others.101The answer is an elaboration of Paracelsus’ three alchemical principlesof mercur y, sulfur, and salt.Q.—What advantages does this give one?A.—Two kinds, the first spiritual, the second is material.Q.—What are they?A.—The spiritual consists of knowing God, nature and himself.The material is wealth and riches.102It is significant that not only the spiritual advantage of alchemy is men-tioned but also the material one. This shows that the alchemy taught bytheRite Ecossais philosophique to its initiates was not merely of a spiri-tual character, but of a “chemical” nature as well.Q.—Has not each of these sciences something which is appropri-ate and particular to it?A.—Pardon me, Most Wise, the one is common and trivial and theother mystical and secret. The invisible world of our theology iscabalistic, celestial, astrological and magical, while the elementar yis physiological and chemical, which reveals by these discoveriesand the separations of fire, the mosa [sic!] hidden and occult se-crets of nature of the three kinds of compositions. We also call thislatter science hermetic, or the operation of the great work.Q.—What are the sources where one may search for this latterscience?A.—The purest are Hermes Trismegistus, Arnold de Villenaeue;Raymond Lully, Gaber, Basil Valentine, Bernard Count of Trevisan,Nicholas Flamel, the Philalethes, the Cosmopolitan, the Presi-dent of the Espagnet and Chevalier, the figures of Abraham the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"117High or Additional Degrees of Freemasonr yJew, Michael Mayer, and many others, whom we will recognizeamong others.103The names referred to as sources for the alchemical science are all well-known and influential alchemical authors. Hermes Trismegistus is of coursethe mythical author of the Corpus Hermeticum, which was first translatedinto Latin by Marsilio Ficino in 1471. During the Renaissance, however,Hermes also became known as an adept of alchemy, and a number ofalchemical texts were attributed to him, of which the Tabula SmaragdinaorEmerald Tablet is perhaps the most famous. This short text containsthe famous dictum “As above, so below,” illustrating the esoteric doctrinethat man is a microcosm corresponding to the macrocosm.104Arnau de Vilanova (1240–1311) was a physician who translatedmedical works by authors such as Galen, Avicenna, and Albuzale intoLatin, and he is generally seen as a representative medieval Galenism.Even though it is not ascertained whether or not Vilanova actually prac-ticed alchemy, there are many legends about him, which connect himwith the practice of alchemy.105 According to one such legend Vilanovais supposed to have performed his first transmutation in Rome in 1286.There are a number of alchemical works ascribed to him, such as Epistolasuper alchemia ad regem Neapolitanum or De secretis naturae and Exemplade arte philosophorum, but these are probably apocr yphic. The firstcollected edition of his works was published at L yons in 1504.Raymond Lully, or Ramón Llull, (1232–1316) was a Catalan mysticwho developed a mysticism combined to a certain extent with Christianmysticism, Sufism and Neoplatonism. The alchemical works ascribed tohim are probably all apocr yphal and include titles such as Apertoriumartis,L’Epistre de l’abbreviation de la pierre benoiste,Clavicula RaymundiLullii,106 and Comendium animae transmutationis artis metallorum.107Alchemical works ascribed to Llull began to circulate during the middleof the fourteenth centur y and these pseudo-Llullian works later becamestandard features in the alchemical corpus. In addition to alchemy, Llull’sname also became associated with magic and kabbalah with works suchasDe auditu cabbalistico attributed to him.108The alchemical works of Geber were extremely influential, and histheor y of sulfur and mercur y was predominant until Paracelsus modi-fied it in the beginning of the sixteenth centur y. Works attributed toGeber include Of the investigation or search of perfection andOf the sumof perfection, or of the perfect magistery.109 The name, Geber, is takenfrom the Arab scholar Jabir ibn Hayyan (c. 721–c. 815).Basilius Valentinus was supposed to have been a fifteenth-centur yBenedictine monk, to whose name a number of alchemical tractates are"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"118Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationascribed. The most influential of these are Die Zwölf Schlüssel, or TwelveKeyes,110 which was first published in 1599, and The Triumphant Chariotof Antimony (1604), which was first published in English in 1660. Thetrue identity of Basilius Valentinus has not been settled, but it has beensuggested that he was a late-sixteenth-centur y author, possibly the firstpublisher of Valentinus’ works, Johann Thölde (1565–1614).Bernard of Trevisan, the Earl of Trevisa in Italy, or Trevisanus (b.c. 1460) was another early influential alchemist, whose works include Laparole delaissee (1618), Le Text d’Alchymie et le Songe-Verd (1695), andTreatise of the Philosophers Stone (1684).111Nicolas Flamel (1330–1418) was a public writer and artisan whoafter his death became regarded as an alchemist, who together with hiswife Perrenelle supposedly succeeded in transmuting mercur y into gold,in 1382. The reason that Flamel came to be regarded as an alchemistprobably stems from the fact that he left a large legacy after his deathand because he had ordered certain allegorical motifs to be painted onarcades at the cemeter y of the Holy Innocents.112 According to the leg-end, he had bought a rare manuscript entitled the “Book of Abrahamthe Jew,” in the ritual referred to as the “figures of Abraham the Jew.”This manuscript allegedly contained seven emblematic drawings thatoutlined the alchemical process. A number of versions of what claim tobe Abraham’s figures have been published, called the Hieroglyphic Fig-ures of Flamel.113The “Philalethes” can refer to either Eugenius Philalethes, or toEirenæus Philalethes—but it is more likely that the reference is to theformer, as the “Cosmopolitan,” which is also mentioned in the ritual, isanother name for the latter. Eugenius Philalethes was the pseudonym ofThomas Vaughan (1621–1665),114 well-known for his translation of theFame and Confession of the Fraternity of the R. C. published in 1652. Hisalchemical works include Anthroposophia Theomagica,Anima MagicaAbscondita, and Magia Adamica, all three first published in 1650.115Vaughan’s alchemical writings were influential not only in England, buton the Continent as well, and his works were translated into French,German, and Latin. The emphasis of his alchemical work is more on thespiritual, or metaphysical, side than on the purely physical. As such, thealchemy of Vaughan can, at least to a certain extent, be seen as a formof mysticism. Eirenæus Philalethes, on the other hand, was probably thepseudonym of the influential scientist George Starkey (1628–1665).Starkey was born in Bermuda and educated at Har vard College. In 1650he immigrated to London to collaborate with one of the most importantpersons in the development of modern chemistr y—Robert Boyle (1627–1691).116 The alchemy of Starkey (if indeed he is the true author behind"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"119High or Additional Degrees of Freemasonr ythe name of Eirenæus Philalethes), differs considerably from his name-sake Eugenius Philalethes,’ in that it focuses on the physical or chemicalaspect of the alchemical work.117Jean d’Espagnet (c. 1564–1637) was an influential alchemist, andis quoted at length by Joseph Pernety in his Les Fables Égyptiennes etGrecques (1786). His alchemical works include La Philosophie NaturelleandArcanum Hermeticæ, both which were included in the influentialcollectionBibliotheca Chemica Curiosa (1702).118 Finally, we have CountMichael Maier (1569–1622), the German alchemist and Rosicrucianapologist. Maier moved in high circles and was, among other things,the confidant of the Emperor Rudolph II and a frequent attendee at thecourt of James I. His most famous alchemical treatise, considered tobe a classic of alchemical literature, is Atalanta Fugiens published in1618. The work contains 50 emblematic figures illustrating the alchemi-cal process.119When the instruction is done, the ritual ends in the followingmanner:The most wise then says: Behold, wise Academician, what thesenior Sur veillant and I have to say for your instruction. Weurge that you study diligently, and we wish you much happinessin all that you do, and wish you a rapid progress in that sciencewhich is the sole and honorable aim of Masonr y.120The lodge is then ritually closed, and as a last act all present say to-gether: “Glor y, laud and honor to the Creator; peace, benediction andprosperity to true Masons!”121The ritual of True Mason is an excellent example of how alchemicaldoctrines are transmitted through a masonic ritual of initiation. The al-chemical doctrines transmitted, especially during the explanation of thetracing board and the instruction, summarize in a condensed form themost important symbols and theories of eighteenth-centur y alchemy.122Furthermore, the list of alchemical authors at the end of the ritual con-tains the most celebrated and influential names in alchemical literature.As such, the ritual of the True Mason was truly initiatic in the sense thatit initiated its adepts in the Arcanum of alchemy. This would naturallydepend on whether the candidate already was familiar with alchemy.Concluding RemarksThe High degrees of Freemasonr y were enormously successful and alarge number of Rites were established during the eighteenth centur y."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"120Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationA number of these Rites, such as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Riteand the Swedish Rite, are active to this day. Others, such as Der Ordendes Gold- und Rosenkreuzes, ceased to exist a long time ago. Perhaps themost striking characteristic of this form of ritual is its diversity, whichincludes such types as Chivalric, Templar, Ecossais, and Egyptian Highdegrees. Their common denominator is that, in various ways, they con-tain elaborations of the Craft degree rituals. Furthermore, it is particu-larly in certain types of High degrees that Western esotericism is explic-itly transmitted. As an example of such a ritual, I analyzed the TrueMason ritual of the Rite Ecossais philosophique, which in essence con-tains a complete exposition of eighteenth-centur y alchemy.In the nineteenth centur y the more outspoken esoteric High de-gree systems, such as the Rites of Memphis and Misraim, the Antientand Primitive Rite, and the Swedenborgian Rite existed on the fringes ofthe masonic world. Some of the masons involved in these more obscuresystems, such as William Wynn Westcott, would be responsible for cre-ating masonic initiator y societies that came to exist outside the fold oftraditional Freemasonr y, of which The Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawnis one of the most famous examples."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Chapter 6The Hermetic Orderof the Golden DawnIntroductionThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn—created in 1888—and therituals of initiation that the order used are of incalculable importance forthe subsequent development of Western esoteric rituals of initiation.Through the elaborate rituals of initiation the candidates were exposedto a composite form of Western esotericism, which by scholars is termedOccultism.1 The foremost characteristic of Occultism is its compositenature, that is, the belief that a wide variety of phenomena are linkedtogether, and further, that these phenomena to a certain extent are ex-planator y of each other. Thus, in the rituals of the Golden Dawn, thereare references to not only alchemy and astrology, but to Tarot, kabbalah,geomancy, ritual magic, and Rosicrucianism inter alia, as well. The prac-tice of linking esoteric phenomena to one another is by no means aninnovation restricted to Occultism. On the contrar y, it is an intrinsic partof the esoteric form of thought as expressed by Faivre under the head-ing of “Correspondences,” and to a lesser degree “the Practice of theConcordance.”2 What was new in Occultism, and perhaps most clearlyexpressed in the rituals of the Golden Dawn, was the marked extent towhich this was carried out. It was not merely a matter of inclusiveness,but rather a conscious syncretistic approach to esotericism as a whole.The candidates of the Golden Dawn were expected to become proficientin a remarkably wide variety of esoteric practices before they wereadmitted to the next degree. The prescribed courses of study show thatthe candidates had to learn the symbolism and technicalities of alchemy,astrology, kabbalah, and the Tarot.3 Gerald Yorke (1901–1983) summedup the importance of the Golden Dawn as follows:121"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"122Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (G.D.) with its InnerOrder of the Rose of Ruby and the Cross of Gold (R.R. et A.C.)was the crowning glor y of the occult revival in the nineteenthcentur y. It synthesised into a coherent whole a vast body ofdisconnected and widely scattered material and welded it into apractical and effective system, which cannot be said of any otheroccult Order of which we know at the time or since.4Despite the syncretistic assimilation of a vast area of esoteric knowl-edge there were no tendencies toward a muddled or chaotic system ofinitiation afforded by the Golden Dawn. On the contrar y, ever y degreeand all the teachings transmitted were part of a coherent whole, aprecise yet simple structure, namely that of the kabbalistic Tree ofLife. At the core of the initiator y system of the Golden Dawn lies theTree of Life with its ten spheres or Sephiroth and twenty-two connect-ing paths. The degrees were connected individually to a certain Sephiraand the candidate symbolically journeyed from Malkuth upward toTiphareth, which was attributed to the grade of Adeptus Minor (Table6.1).5 At each initiation the Temple was rearranged in order to ad-equately illustrate the particular Sephira to which the degree was at-tributed. To a large extent the temple was nothing but a symbolicrepresentation of the Tree of Life. It is this connection to the Tree ofLife that makes the initiator y system of the Golden Dawn unique in thesense that it was the first of its kind and marks the beginning of a newtrend in Western esotericism.The use of the Tree of Life as the structural core of Golden Dawn’sinitiator y system should be considered in the light of the historical contextof the last decades of the nineteenth centur y in Britain.

Even though literar y kabbalah still held aprominent position within Occultist Kabbalah, the emphasis was no longeron interpreting the Holy Scripture, but rather to reduce significant wordsinto numbers and thereby reach a fuller understanding of their importby relating them to words of similar numerical value. Far more signifi-cant, however, was the use of the Tree of Life as a model of the universeto which ever y conceivable phenomenon whatsoever could be applied.In a sense, the linear scheme of the Tree of Life became a methodwhereby it was possible to reach order out of an apparently chaoticmass of phenomena, without necessarily any further knowledge ofkabbalistic doctrine. The knowledge of kabbalah, which the chief expo-nents of Occultist Kabbalah possessed, was to a large extent limited tosecondar y sources.In 1896 there appeared an English translation of Éliphas Lévi’sseminal work Transcendental Magic in which the Tarot was connectedto the Tree of Life. The works of Éliphas Lévi had not only been instru-mental in the French “Occult Revival” of the latter half of the eighteenthcentur y, but had also influenced the occult scene in Britain. The trans-lation of Lévi’s chief works into English disseminated his theories onvarious esoteric topics firmly into British Occultism6. Arguably, the mainthesis was the connection of the Tarot with the Tree of Life.But Lévi’s most startling innovation was in connecting the Cabalawith the Tarot. Modern occultists take this connection so muchfor granted that it tends to be forgotten that there is absolutelyno historical evidence that the two were in any way related.(. . .) In his Doctrine et rituel de la haute magie he connects thetwenty-two trumps with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrewalphabet and the four suits with the four letters of thetetragrammaton or Name of God and the ten numbered cardsof each suit with the ten Sephiroth.7Even though the Golden Dawn is to be credited with a number of inno-vations within British Occultism, it is nonetheless a child of its time andthus mirrors the interests and trends of Western esotericism in Britainat this particular point in histor y. The ritual of initiation that will beanalyzed in this chapter is not only a prime example of which esotericdoctrines were in vogue in the last decades of the nineteenth centur y,it is above all of utmost importance for the understanding of a large partof the rituals that are found in contemporar y or modern esotericism."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"124Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationHistor yThe histor y of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is, like that of themajority of closed societies in the west, of a twofold nature; factual andlegendar y.8 In Anderson’s Constitutions of Free-Masons published in 1723it is assumed that Adam was skilled in the art of geometr y and it isimplied that masonr y ultimately stems from Adam, “our first Parent.”9 Inmy opinion, this should not be viewed as a simple fraud or an attemptat deceiving would-be members, but rather as an expression of a certainform of thought in which legitimacy can be founded on spiritual ratherthan historical grounds. More often than not, stories regarding the foun-dation of closed societies are by its members interpreted symbolicallyrather than literally. This idea pertains directly to the idea of transmis-sion, which Faivre considers as one of the constituting aspects of West-ern esotericism.According to the official/legendar y10 histor y of the Golden Dawn,William Wynn Westcott (1848–1925), a high-ranking Freemason andprominent member of the Societas Rosicruciana In Anglia (SRIA)11,obtained some documents from another mason, Rev. A.F.A. Woodford(1821–1887), one of the founding members of the research Lodge QuatuorCoronati, No. 2076. The stories differ on how Woodford came into pos-session of these documents, but he supposedly identified the documents,which were written in cipher (hence referred to as the Cipher MS.), asbeing pseudo-masonic rituals of a Rosicrucian provenance. The CipherMS. was sent to Westcott by Woodford on August 8, 1887.12 Westcottdeciphered the rituals and enlisted the help of S. Liddell Mathers (1854–1918) who rewrote them into workable form. Among the papers was anaddress to a certain Fräulein Anna Sprengel in Germany (Soror SapiensDominabitur Astris), who was supposed to be a Rosicrucian adept andmember of “Die Goldene Dämmerung,” that is, the Golden Dawn. Aftera brief correspondence with her, Westcott was chartered to open a Templeof the Golden Dawn, which was to be ruled by a triumvirate: Westcott,Woodman, and Mathers.However, in all probability the Cipher MS. was composed by Ken-neth Mackenzie (1833–1886)13 with the intention of improving the ritualsof the Royal Order of Sikha and the Sat B’hai, an order founded by anIndian Army Officer, Captain James Henr y Lawrence-Archer (1823–1889).Mackenzie, however, soon lost interest in this order and instead gotinvolved with the British branch of the Swedenborgian Rite under theleadership of John Yarker (1833–1913). After Mackenzie’s death in 1886the rituals found their way into Westcott’s possession.14 The correspon-dence with Fräulein Anna Sprengel, through which the Golden Dawn"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"125The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnwas chartered, was a fraud. The German branch of the Golden Dawn isconsidered by scholars to have never existed, except perhaps in theimagination of Westcott.15 One can only speculate as to why Westcottwent to such lengths to forge a stor y of origin for the Order, but itseems highly unlikely that Westcott sought personal advantages throughthe formation of the Golden Dawn. Being a longtime mason and deeplyfamiliar with esoteric literature, he was undoubtedly well-acquainted withthe importance of legitimacy in transmitting esoteric teachings in gen-eral and in the formation of initiator y societies in particular. Further-more, legendar y stories of origin were quite common in the mileau ofnineteenth-centur y British initiator y societies. For instance, the SocietasRosicruciana In Anglia and the Red Cross of Constantine, both foundedby Robert Wentworth Little (1840–1878) had completely legendar y storiesof origin. Westcott’s endeavor was to afford the Golden Dawn an appar-ently legitimate foundation upon which to grow, but histor y would provethis foundation highly unstable, as it would be the cause of a disastrousconflict just twelve years later.Nonetheless, on Februar y 12, 1888, the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn was officially chartered in England to W. W. Westcott,S. L. Mathers, and Dr. William Robert Woodman (1854–1918), SupremeMagus of the SRIA, by Soror S.D.A. of Germany (her signature on thecharter made by Westcott). On March 1, 1888, the Isis-Urania TempleNo. 3 was officially opened in London.16 Initially, male members wererecruited from the SRIA, but soon candidates were drawn from else-where, such as the ranks of the Theosophical Society. In less than a yearsome sixty members had joined the order. Soon other temples werechartered in Britain: Osiris Temple in Weston-super-Mare, and HorusTemple in Bradford. The apparent success of this newly founded ordercaused misgivings in certain circles, most notably in the TheosophicalSociety who set up an Esoteric Section as a countermove.17 Blavatsky was,however, not content with the formation of the Esoteric Section, butrather ordered her members not to join any other occult order and togive up their existing memberships. Diplomatic negotiations then fol-lowed between the two orders that ended in their mutual acceptance ofone other. Some minor dissensions within the order followed, but as awhole the order continued to expand. In 1893 the important Amen-RaTemple of Edinburgh was chartered, followed by Ahathoor Temple in1894 in Paris, where Mathers and his wife Moina had moved in 1892.1892 marked a new phase in the histor y of the Golden Dawn, asit was only now that the Inner Order, or Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis,was ritually worked. The rituals of the Inner Order were writtenby Mathers and their central leitmotif was the legend of Christian"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"126Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationRosenkreutz, the legendar y founder of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood.True to the legend of Rosenkreutz, a Vault of the Adepts, that is,Rosenkreutz’s tomb, was central to the rituals of the inner order. Thisvault was seven-sided, adorned with numerable astrological and alchemi-cal signs, and painted with Golden Dawn’s characteristic “flashingcolours.”18 However, the Inner Order did not only differ in the emphasison Rosicrucianism, but also in the important fact that its memberswere expected to put their theoretical magical knowledge into prac-tice. The Adepts, as the members of the Inner Order were referred to,saw themselves as magicians in the proper sense of the word. In theheyday of Golden Dawn, around 1896, some 300 members had joinedthe ranks of the order, of which about 60 eventually were initiated intothe Inner Order—the existence of which was kept secret to membersof the Outer Order.As time went on Mathers became the sole Chief of the GoldenDawn, as Westcott had been outmaneuvered. However, in the late 1890sMathers’ behavior became more and more eccentric and his autocraticrule soon caused dissension among members of the Inner Order inLondon. In 1900 this dissension culminated in an outright revolt againstMathers, which, in essence, he had brought upon himself. On Februar y16, he had written a letter to Florence Farr (1860–1917), who was actingas his representative in the Inner Order in London. In his letter hecautioned her not to reveal the contents, but the charges contained wereso grave that it became the source for an investigating committee ap-pointed by some Inner Order members. The object of the letter wasapparently to justify Mathers’ autocratic rule, which he tried to accom-plish by denouncing any importance that Westcott might have had inthe formation of the order. What Mathers actually did was not only todenounce Westcott but also to state that the order was based on a fraud.[Westcott] has NEVER been at any time either in personal, orin written communication with the Secret Chiefs of the Order,he having either himself forged or procured to be forged the pro-fessed correspondence between him and them, and my tonguehaving been tied all these years by a previous Oath of Secrecyto him, demanded by him, from me, before showing me what hehad either done or caused to be done or both.—You must com-prehend from what little I say here, the extreme gravity of sucha matter, and again I ask you, both for his sake and that of theOrder, not to force me to go farther into the subject.19The investigating committee, led by William Butler Yeats (1865–1939),confronted Westcott with these allegations, but Westcott made a poor"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"127The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawndefense for himself, stating that all his witnesses were dead. Matherstried to disband the committee since he, as Chief of the Order, had notconsented to its formation in the first place. His demands were ignoredand the London Adepti further declared themselves independent of hisrule. In a desperate attempt to resume power Mathers sent AleisterCrowley as his envoy to London, but Crowley only managed to worsenthe conflict even more, if indeed that were possible.Thus ends the saga of the Golden Dawn, but various factions of theorder continued its rituals in more or less adapted forms.20 Today thereare a number of organizations that claim to represent the “genuine”Golden Dawn, but as to the validity of their claims, a scholarly investi-gation is yet to be made.A Note on SourcesThe rituals of the Golden Dawn were never printed, but copied by handby its members. A number of manuscripts of these rituals are in variousprivate and institutional libraries.21 Part of the rituals came to the atten-tion of the public in 1900 when a court case was conducted against acertain Mrs. Horos and her husband. The couple had obtained some ofthe Golden Dawn rituals by Mathers and used them in setting up theirown order, The Theocratic Society, which they used as a cover for luringyoung women and girls into their fold and then sexually abusing them.The first printed edition of the rituals of the outer order was issued byAleister Crowley in The Equinox Volume I, Number II (1909), in a spe-cial supplement entitled “The Temple of Solomon the King, Book II.” Atthe end of the article, Crowley announced the publication of the InnerOrder rituals in the coming issue. Mathers tried to restrain Crowleyfrom publishing these rituals by posing a court injunction—in vain. TheEquinox Volume I, Number III (1910) contained the ritual of the 5°= 6\u0002grade of Adeptus Minor in “The Temple of Solomon the King, Book III.”The rituals that Crowley had published were, however, in an abbreviatedform, and important information is thus lacking in this version. Betweenthe years 1937 and 1940 Israel Regardie (1907–1985) published TheGolden Dawn. An Account of the Teachings, Rites and Ceremonies of theOrder of the Golden Dawn. Regardie, who had been initiated in the StellaMatutina, included a wealth of information on the Golden Dawn in hisfour thick volumes, but the rituals that he printed were not the ones ofthe original Golden Dawn, but those of one of its off-shoots, StellaMatutina, whose rituals differ considerably from the original ones. Itwas only in 1972 that R. G. Torrens published The Secret Rituals of theGolden Dawn, which contained rituals taken from manuscripts dated1899, before the split of 1900. Unfortunately, Torrens only published the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"128Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationrituals of the outer order. In 1984 Regardie published his massive TheComplete Golden Dawn System of Magic, which includes the rituals fromNeophyte to Philosophus in volume six, and the Ritual of the Portal andthe Adeptus Minor Grade ritual in volume seven. These rituals wereissued to Leigh F. Gardner c.1894–1896, and the original manuscriptsare in the Gerald Yorke Collection, the Warburg Institute, University ofLondon.Description of the Neophyte RitualThe rituals of the Golden Dawn follow the same basic pattern that canbe found in virtually all Western rituals of initiation, and they show allcharacteristics of this type of rituals. The Grade Names primarily derivefrom the ones used by the SRIA, who in its turn borrowed them fromDer Orden des Gold- und Rosenkreuzes, a masonic order active in thelatter half of the eighteenth centur y in Germany. The officers in therituals of the Golden Dawn, whose titles are taken from the Eleusinianmysteries, correspond directly to officers in masonic rituals:Golden DawnFreemasonr yHierophantWorshipful MasterHiereusSenior WardenHegemonJunior WardenKeruxInner GuardStolistesSenior DeaconDadouchesJunior DeaconSentinelTylerThe Neophyte Ritual can be divided into six parts, namely Opening,Admission into the Temple, Obligation, Admission into the order, In-struction, and Closing.OpeningAs in any opening of a masonic ritual, it starts with the usual assurancethat the temple is properly guarded by posting a Sentinel (in masonr yTyler) outside the doors. The members present, who wear the properregalia, give proof of being initiated members by giving the signs of aNeophyte. It is stated that the names of the three chief officers all com-mence with the letter H, for example, Hierophant, Hiereus, and Hege-mon. This letter is a symbol of “life, because the character H is one"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"129The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnmode of representing the ancient Greek aspirate; and Breathing, andBreath, are evidence of life.”22 Then follows a description of the threeassistant officers (i.e., Dadouches, Stolistes, and Kerux) and the Senti-nel. The object of the Sentinel is to guard the door, to keep out anyintruders, and to prepare the candidate. The Dadouches, who is placedin the south, symbolizes heat and dr yness. His duty is to “attend thecenser, and the incense, and [to] assist in the purification and consecra-tion by Fire of the Hall, of the Members, and of the Candidate.” TheStolistes, placed in the north, symbolizes cold and moisture. His duty isto check that the regalia of the officers is properly worn, to “attend tothe cup of lustral water,” and to purify and consecrate the Hall, mem-bers, and candidate with water. The Kerux is placed within the portal ofthe Temple, which he protects. He further leads the mystic circumam-bulation and carries a lamp and a wand, which symbolizes “the Light ofOccult Science and directing power.”Then follows the questioning of the Hegemon and Hiereus: theHegemon is placed between the pillars of Hermes and Solomon andfaces the cubical altar of the Universe. When asked by the Hierophantwhat his duties are, he gives the following reply:I preside over the symbolized gateway of Occult Science. I amthe reconciler between light and darkness. I immediately followthe Kerux in the mystic circumambulations. I superintend thepreparation of the Candidate; lead him through the path ofdarkness into light and assist in his reception, and I aid theother officers in the execution of their duties.23The white color of his robe symbolizes purity, and his peculiar ensign ofoffice is a mitre-headed scepter, which symbolizes “religion, to guideand regulate life.” His office symbolizes “those higher aspirations of thesoul, which should guide its actions.”The Hiereus is placed on a throne in the west, which symbolizes“increase of darkness; decrease of light.” He wears a black robe, symbolof darkness, and carries a sword (severity and judgment) and a so-calledBanner of the West, symbol of twilight. His office symbolizes fortitude,and his duty is thus described:I preside over the twilight and darkness, which encompass us inthe absence of the Sun of Life and Light. I guard the gate of theWest. I assist in the reception of the Candidate and I superin-tend the inferior officers in the execution of their duties.24"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"130Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationFinally, the Hierophant, the chief officer, describes his office:My place is on the Throne of the East, which symbolizes the riseof the Sun of Life and Light—my duty is to rule and govern thisHall in accordance with the laws of the Order: the red colour ofmy robe symbolizes Light: my insignia are the Sceptre and theBanner of the East, which signify power and light, mercy andwisdom, and my office is that of expounder of the mysteries.25The Hall, or temple, and the members are then purified with water bythe Stolistes, and with fire by the Dadouches. A procession is then maderound the temple, called the mystic circumambulation. It is “symbolic ofthe rise of the light,” and it is done in due form: “Kerux first, thenHegemon, Hiereus, other members and Stolistes and Daduouches last.They pass three times around from East by South to West. After firstround Hiereus returns to his place, after second round Hegemon, afterthird remaining members, each as he passes the throne of the Eastsalutes and lowers insignia, except Hierophant.” After the completion ofthe circumambulation the Hierophant adores the Lord of the Universe:Holy art Thou, Lord of the Universe.Holy art Thou, whom nature hath not formed.Holy art Thou, The Vast and Mighty One.Lord of the Light and of the Darkness.26The Kerux is commanded by the Hierophant, “in the name of the Lordof the Universe,” to declare that the Hall of the Neophytes has beenopened, which he does by proclaiming:In the name of the Lord of the Universe, I declare that the Sunhath arisen, and that the Light shineth in the Darkness.27The Opening ends with the three chief officers uttering the followingwords, alternating the uttering starting with the Hierophant and endingwith the Hiereus:Khabs Am PekhtKonx Om PaxLight in Extension28Admission into the TempleThe Hierophant states that he has received a dispensation from theGreatly Honoured Chiefs of the Second (i.e., Inner) Order to admit the"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"131The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawncandidate, to the Neophyte degree. The Hegemon is ordered to preparethe candidate, which he does by leaving the temple and hoodwinkingthe Candidate and tying a rope thrice round his waist. The Candidate isthen addressed by the Hegemon:Child of Earth, arise and enter the Path of Darkness.29Prompted by the Kerux, the Hierophant affirms that he gives his con-sent to the candidate to be admitted, and that the candidate from nowon is to be known by a certain motto. The candidate is led by theHegemon into the Temple, but the Kerux informs the candidate that hecannot enter the Sacred Hall since he is unpurified and unconsecrated.The Stolistes purifies the candidate (who is addressed as “Child of Earth”throughout this part of the ritual) by making a cross on his foreheadwith water. The Dadouches purifies the candidate in his turn with fire.The Hierophant asks the candidate why he requests admission into theorder, to which he answers, prompted by the Hegemon:30My soul is wandering in darkness, seeking for the Light of OccultKnowledge, and I believe that in this Order the knowledge ofthat Light may be obtained.31The Hierophant proceeds by asking the candidate to take an obligationto “keep inviolate the secrets and mysteries of our Order.” He is assuredthat there is nothing in the obligation that might be incompatible withhis civil, moral, or religious duties.ObligationThe candidate kneels on both knees in front of the altar. His right handis placed in the center of a triangle and the left is held by the Hierophant.The Hiereus stands on the candidate’s left side, the Hegemon on thecandidate’s right. The Hierophant stands behind the altar in the east.With bowed head, the candidate repeats his full name at length and saysafter the Hierophant the obligation. The obligation, which is ratherlengthy, can be summarized as follows:The Candidate affirms that he, by his own free will and accord:1.Will not divulge anything whatsoever concerning the order,its members or its teachings.2.Will maintain a kind and benevolent relation with all themembers of the order."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiation3.Will not seek to obtain any ritual or instruction which he isnot entitled to, and that he will guard any documents per-taining to the order carefully.4.Will “undertake to prosecute with zeal the study of OccultSciences, seeing that this Order is not established for thebenefit of those who desire only a superficial knowledgethereof.”5.Will not be hypnotized or mesmerized, or place himself insuch a condition that he loses the control of his thoughts,words or actions.6.Will not use his occult powers in any evil purposes.7.Will persevere throughout his ceremony of admission.8.Will obser ve his obligation, under the penalty of:[. . .] being expelled from this Order, as a wilfully perjured wretch,void of all moral worth, and unfit for the society of all right andtrue persons, and in addition under the awful penalty of volun-tarily submitting myself to a deadly and hostile current of willset in motion by the chiefs of the Order, by which I should fallslain and paralysed without visible weapon as if slain by thelightning flash.

The Hierophant recites the following:The voice of my higher soul said unto me, ‘Let me enter thePath of Darkness, peradventure thus shall I obtain Light. I amthe only being in an abyss of darkness. From the darknesscame I forth ere my birth, from the silence of a primeval sleep,and the voice of ages answered unto my soul, “I am he thatformulates in darkness, Child of Earth; the Light shineth in thedarkness, but the darkness comprehendeth it not.”’33"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"133The Hermetic Order of the Golden DawnA mystic circumambulation takes “place in the path of darkness with thesymbolic Light of Occult Science to guide the way.” The Kerux leads theprocession with Light and Wand, the Hegemon guides the candidate,the Stolistes and the Dadouches follow, thrice round. They halt in thesouth. The candidate is halted by the Kerux who informs him that hecannot enter the “path of the West” since he is unpurified and unconse-crated. The Stolistes duly consecrates him with water, and the Dadoucheswith fire. The Hegemon allows the candidate, twice consecrated, toapproach the “gate of the West.” Being conducted to the west, thecandidate’s hoodwink is slipped up for the first time. Prompted bythe Hiereus, the Hegemon declares that the name of the Guardian ofthe West is Darkness, “the Great One of the Paths of the Shades.”The Hiereus addresses the candidate:Child of Earth, fear is failure. Therefore be without fear, for inthe heart of the coward virtue abideth not. Thou hast knownme, so pass thou on.34The hoodwink is slipped down again, and the candidate informed thathe cannot enter the “Path of the East” since he is unpurified and uncon-secrated. Once again he is purified with water and fire, and accordinglyadmitted to approach the “gate of the East.” When arrived at the thronein the east, the Hierophant rises with the banner in his left hand, andraises the scepter with his right hand as to strike the candidate. TheHegemon slips up the candidate’s hoodwink. The Hierophant says “Thoucanst not pass by me, saith the Guardian of the East, unless thou cansttell me my name.” The Hegemon answers “Light dawning in darknessis thy name, the light of a golden day.” As the Hierophant lowers thescepter, he says to the candidate:Child of Earth, remember that unbalanced force is evil, unbal-anced mercy is but weakness, unbalanced severity is but op-pression.

The three chief officers join the points of their scepters andswords over the candidate’s head, and say together: “Frater X.Y.Z. wereceive thee into this the Order of the Golden Dawn.” As in the opening,Khabs Am Pekht, etc., is recited.InstructionThe candidate is informed that before him, during his wanderings indarkness, the Kerux had carried a lamp, which is a symbol of the Hid-den Light of Occult Science. Conducted east of the altar, the candidateis instructed in the secrets of the Neophyte degree, which consists oftwo signs, a grip or token, a grand word, and a password, the latterbeing changed at each equinox. The candidate receives a final consecra-tion by water and fire. The rope is removed from his waist, “the lastremaining symbol of the path of darkness,” and he is then invested withthe badge of the grade by the Hegemon, which symbolizes “Light dawn-ing in darkness.” A final circumambulation follows, after which there isa lengthy address by the Hierophant.

The Hiereus further instructs theNeophyte in a short address, which can be summarized as follows:(1) Do not forget to give due honor and reverence to the Lord ofthe Universe."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiation(2) Do not ridicule the form of religion professed by another.(3) Do not forget to keep ever ything pertaining to the order secret.4) Study the “Great Arcanum,” that is, the proper equilibrium ofmercy and severity.5) Don’t be daunted by the difficulties of Occult Study.The Hierophant informs the Neophyte what he needs to do before beingeligible to proceed to the next grade, which consist of becoming thor-oughly acquainted with certain occult knowledge. The Neophyte is thenled to a table where he pours a few drops of a solution on a plate, whichturns red in the semblance of blood, which is a final warning to heed hisoath of secrecy. Lastly, the Hierophant reminds the Neophyte that hisadmission does not entitle him to initiate any person into the order with-out “dispensation from the Grand High Chiefs of the Second Order.”ClosingThe Kerux proclaims “Ekas, Ekas, Este, Bebeloi,” after which theHierophant bids the members to assist him in closing the Hall in theNeophyte Grade.

The last one to partake is the Kerux, whoinverts the cup and says “It is finished.” The Hierophant exclaims“Tetelestai,” and the chief officers knock once.

It is, to a certain degree,the foundation of all subsequent rituals because it not only containsfundamental phenomena that will be present throughout the initiator ysystem, but it was considered to be the most important ritual, perhapsonly equaled by the ritual for the Adeptus Minor grade of the InnerOrder. The structure of the ritual closely follows that of Craft Freema-sonr y, especially that of the Entered Apprentice degree, and the officerscorrespond directly to masonr y. The Hierophant has his seat in the east,as does the Worshipful Master in those in masonr y, in order to illumi-nate the temple in likeness of the sun. The two pillars are present withinmasonic lodges as well, where they are referred to as Jachin and Boaz.In fact, a large part of the items used in the ritual can be derived frommasonic rituals, but their import does not necessarily correspond withone another. The symbols used by the Golden Dawn were interpretedfrom an esoteric perspective, or more properly from an Occultist per-spective. Fortunately, we are able know at some depth how the symbolswere interpreted by the originators of the rituals because some docu-ments describing them have sur vived. Chief among these are Docu-ments Z.1 “Symbolism of the Temple” and Z.3 “On the Grade of Neo-phyte.”40 I will thus avail myself of these documents in analyzing theritual of the Neophyte grade.The officers, even though they derive from masonr y, differ in theirimport compared to Freemasonr y. The Dadouches and Stolistes sym-bolize Fire and Water, and they have their seats in the south and north.In Western esotericism the four elements correspond to the four pointsof the compass: Fire to South, Water to North, Air to West, and Earthto East. In Document Z.1 it is stated that the Neophyte grade is con-nected to the Tree of Life, and that the Temple is arranged in accor-dance with its symbolism:The Temple as arranged in the 0 = 0 Grade of Neophyte of theOrder of the Golden Dawn in the Outer is placed looking to-wards the Yod He of Yod He Vau He in the Malkuth of Assiah,that is, that as Yod and He answer unto the Sephiroth Chokmah"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"138Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationand Binah in the Tree, unto Abba and Aima, through whoseknowledge that of Kether may be obtained, Vau for the rest, exceptMalkuth, which is the He final: even so, the sacred rites of theTemple may gradually, and as it were in spite of themselves, raisethe Neophyte unto the Knowledge of his Higher Self.41The name of the Lord, Yod He Vau He (), has many meaningswithin esotericism: for instance, the four letters refer to the four ele-ments: or the four so-called mother letters: in this case they representa formula of creation, or rather emanation, since in kabbalah the worldis considered to have emanated from God, and thus they are attributedto the Tree of Life and the four kabbalistic worlds, Atziluth, the Arche-typal World, Briah, the creative world, Yetzirah, the world of formationandAssiah, the material world.42 The last part, referring to the Neophytereaching Knowledge of his higher self, is an intimation of the primeobjective of the Inner Order.The initiation is considered to take place in Malkuth, the Kingdom,which usually is considered as the Material World. The Sephiroth Yesod,Hod, and Netzach are also symbolically present in the temple, but theNeophyte does not venture to these higher spheres. In the east, thereis a veil, which symbolizes the Veil of Paroketh, which separates thelower Sephiroth from Tiphareth, which in the system of the GoldenDawn marked the separation between the Outer and Inner orders. Be-hind the veil, unknown by the candidate, the three ruling chiefs of theorder had their seats.The two pillars of the temple are painted in white and black, re-spectively, just as in some masonic lodges, but in the Golden Dawn theyare attributed with kabbalistic significance:They represent Mercy and Severity, the former being white andin Netzach, the latter black and in Hod. Their bases are cubicaland black to represent the Earth Element in Malkuth, the col-umns are respectively white and black to manifest eternal bal-ance of the Scales of Justice. Upon them should be representedin counterchanged colours any appropriate Egyptian designemblematic of the soul. The scarlet tetrahedronal capitals repre-sent the Fire of Test and Trial and between the Balance is thePorchway of the Immeasurable Region.43The kabbalistic columns referred to run along the “outer” Sephiroth ofthe Tree of Life—the white: Netzach, Chesed, and Chokmah; and theblack: Hod, Geburah and Binah. The Egyptian designs are taken from"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"139The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnthe Vignettes to chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead (White Pillar) andfrom the Vignette to chapter 125 of the same work (Black Pillar). Thedesign on the white pillar is intended to accompany the Hymn to theRising Sun, and the one on the black represents the deceased, passingby the forty-two assessors to the Hall of Judgment, where the soul isweighed, previous to being conducted into the presence of Osiris.The Black Pillar symbolizes the pathway of darkness, the Nega-tive Confession, as the White Pillar represents the Hymn to theRising Sun, the Pathway of Light, and the Positive Confession.Between the two is the straight and narrow path that must betrodden by the initiate.43The use of Egyptian symbolism was ver y much in vogue during the lastdecades of the nineteenth centur y, especially in occultist circles, sinceancient Egypt was considered to be the birthplace of not only alchemyand magic, but of “true initiation” as well. Mathers staged what he termedthe Rites of Isis in Paris and he was a great admirer of Egyptology, whichis evidenced in the rituals of the Golden Dawn. The officers in the Neo-phyte grade were considered to be symbolic of certain Egyptian gods:Hierophant: Osiris in the Netherland. Expounder of the Myster-ies in the Hall of the Dual Manifestation of the Goddess ofTruth.Hierus: Horus in the Abode of the Blindness unto Ignorance ofthe Higher.

By looking at the prescribed coursesof study for each degree, the vast area of knowledge intended under theheading “Occult Science” is easily discerned.46 Another reoccurring notionis “Light,” which, as far as I can see, is used in two manners. First, thereis the Light of Occult Science, which aims at awakening the “hidden”properties in man, and thus to render him “more than human,” or super-human. Second, the Light is considered in general terms as the spirituallight as opposed to the material darkness, but more specifically as thelimitless light (Ain Soph Aur), which spreads downward through theTree of Life, that is, the emanations of the godhead. The mystic circu-mambulation, which is symbolic of the rise of the light, should be inter-preted in accordance with these notions of light.The adoration of the Lord, which concludes the opening is inter-esting because it clearly states that the Lord is one, that despite thefrequent allusions and uses of a wide range of gods, the concept of theLord is monotheistic. All the various gods, angels, and demons encoun-tered in the system of the Golden Dawn are, in the end, nothing butvarious aspects of the One God, since they are all attributable to theTree of Life, which is the emanations of the godhead.Admission into the TempleThe purifications by water and fire do not necessarily reflect esotericconnotations since such purifications are common in nonesoteric masonicrituals as well. However, to the members of the Golden Dawn they cer-tainly had their esoteric meaning. The most important aspect of this partis the candidate’s answer to the question why he seeks admission intothe order:My soul is wandering in darkness, seeking for the Light of OccultKnowledge, and I believe that in this Order the knowledge ofthat Light may be obtained.47This answer adequately summarizes the main object of the GoldenDawn—to teach its members Occultism, which will render their soulfree from the material darkness. In this sense the Golden Dawn can beseen not only as an initiator y society, but also as an esoteric school. Themembers of the Golden Dawn did not only encounter esoteric teachingsthrough the rituals, but they were also required to follow detailed coursesof study of esoteric doctrines in order to advance through the degrees."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"141The Hermetic Order of the Golden DawnDaniël van Egmond has defined what he terms an esoteric school, underwhich heading he discusses the Golden Dawn, the Esoteric Section oftheTheosophical Society, and the Mysteria Mystica Aeterna, allegedlyfounded by Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925):I define an esoteric school as an institution that teaches itsstudents particular theories and practices that may enable themto transform themselves into human beings who are aware of,and are guided by, their “souls,” “higher selves,” or “holyguardian angels.”48The definition points toward the object of the teachings, namely to trans-form the members. This transformation can be seen as an intrinsic partof the initiator y system of the Golden Dawn whose stated object was torender the members “more than human.”ObligationFrom an esoteric perspective there are a number of interesting aspectsto the obligation that the candidate takes. First, he promises that he will“undertake to prosecute with zeal the study of Occult Sciences, seeingthat this Order is not established for the benefit of those who desireonly a superficial knowledge thereof.” Indeed, if he had the desire toproceed within the initiator y system of the Golden Dawn, he could notdo so if he did not “prosecute with zeal the study of Occult Sciences”since vigorous examinations awaited him before he could become eli-gible to proceed. Second, he swore that he would not let himself be“hypnotized or mesmerized, or place himself in such a condition that heloses the control of his thoughts, words or actions.” This might seemcontradictor y to the common notion of the occultist as someone whowillingly submits himself to the influence of foreign dominion, but theoccultism of the Golden Dawn had a rational and “scientific” approach tooccult phenomena, and a strong personal will was a prime requisite inorder to become an efficient magician.49 The third aspect of the obligationthat needs to be examined is the penalty, which includes the part thatstates that the candidate “voluntarily submitting [himself] to a deadly andhostile current of will set in motion by the chiefs of the order, by whichI should fall slain by the lightning flash.” There has been much specula-tion as to the nature of the “current of will” set in motion by the chiefs,but it appears that the chiefs of the order claimed to posses the ability toeliminate people through supernatural means. It is thus an intimation ofthe possible power of occult science to which Adepts can attain."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationAdmission into the OrderThis part is marked by the purification and consecration of the candi-date, which in a mystical manner exalts his nature to such an extent thathe becomes worthy of the order. The part that states “Child of Earth,remember that unbalanced force is evil, unbalanced mercy is but weak-ness, unbalanced severity is but oppression” is a further reference to thetwo pillars of the Tree of Life in the sense that the initiates of the GoldenDawn strived for spiritual balance, symbolized by the two pillars of theTree of Life. The Hierophant ends his invocation of the Lord and urgesthe candidate: “Child of Earth, long hast thou dwelt in darkness. Quitthe night and seek the day.” This is a further prompting of the candidateto turn his back to the material darkness and to seek the spiritual Light.InstructionThis is the most crucial part of the initiation as it instructs the candidatein the symbolism of the degree and for the first time discloses theorder’s guarded secrets. “Candidate is informed that before him duringhis wanderings in darkness, the Kerux had carried a lamp, which is asymbol of the Hidden Light of Occult Science.” This can be interpretedas the way of the material darkness, that is, by studying the occultscience of the Golden Dawn the candidate will find a path in the dark-ness. The reference to Sepher Yetzirah,or Book of Formation is impor-tant as it gives a direct reference to a kabbalistic text. The Sepher Yetzirahis one of the oldest kabbalistic texts and is especially devoted to theemanations of God, that is, the ten Sephiroth. The book was translatedinto Latin by Guillaume Postel (1510–1581), “that strangely stubbornFrench Hebraizing Christian mystic and Cabalist,”50 in the middle of thesixteenth centur y, and it was a well-known work among ChristianKabbalists. The Sepher Yetzirah was available to the members of theGolden Dawn in a translation by Westcott, first published in 1890 in aprivate edition limited to a hundred copies.51The Rose, Fire, Cup of Wine, Bread, and Salt allude, as stated inthe ritual, to the four elements (air, fire, water, and earth). In the con-cluding address of the Hiereus, there are two points that directly referto occultism, namely to “Study the ‘Great Arcanum,’ i.e. the properequilibrium of mercy and severity” and “Don’t be daunted by the diffi-culties of Occult Study.” The reference to proper equilibrium betweenmercy and severity is a final reference to the Adept’s path between thetwo kabbalistic pillars, which will lead to light. The encouragement notto be daunted by the apparent difficulties of Occult study is probably"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"143The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnwell founded since it was not a small task to become a bona fide studentof the Golden Dawn’s Occult Science.ClosingThe closing follows the procedure of the opening, with the importantexception of the partaking of the elements. This can be regarded as anextended form of communion: the members inhale the perfume of aRose (air); feel the warmth of the sacred Fire by spreading hands overit (fire);52 eat bread and salt (earth); and finally drink wine (water).The concluding address to the members is full of references to theclassical goals of alchemy: “May what we have partaken of sustain us inour search for the Quintessence; The Stone of the Philosophers andPerfect Happiness and the Summum Bonum.” Traditionally the goal ofthe alchemist was eternal life and the ability to transmute base metalsinto gold, the latter often conceived of in a spiritual manner in which thetransmutation was seen as a spiritual purification of the alchemist’s soul.What conclusions are to be drawn from this analysis of the GoldenDawn’s first ritual of initiation? In my opinion, the foremost characteris-tic of the ritual is the marked kabbalistic influence. It is stressed on anumber of occasions throughout the ritual that the path to occult illumi-nation leads between the kabbalistic pillars of Mercy and Severity, andthat the candidate should strive for balance between these two forces. Inthe subsequent rituals the kabbalistic influence becomes even moretangible and apparent as the candidate symbolically journeys upwardalong the paths and the Sephiroth. Another characteristic are the fre-quent allusions to the Occult Science and the Occult Light. The questfor light runs as a red thread throughout the rituals of the Golden Dawn,and it is the ultimate goal of the members to become illuminated withthis Occult Light.Concluding RemarksTheHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is one of the most importantand influential English masonic initiator y societies of the late nineteenthcentur y. The originators of the order, Westcott, Mathers, and Woodman,were masons with a particular interest in the more esoteric and obscuremasonic systems of the day. Given the fact the order, in its original form,was active for only twelve years, from 1888 to 1900, its legacy to lateresoteric societies is remarkable. The initiator y system of the GoldenDawn, based on the linear scheme of the kabbalistic Tree of Life, hasbeen adopted by innumerable later societies. This initiator y system was,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"144Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationfurthermore, connected to a ver y specific spiritual “enlightenment” thatthe members were expected to reach as Adeptus Minor, an enlighten-ment that later has become known as the Knowledge of and Conversa-tion with the Holy Guardian Angel. Although this particular spiritualstate, or enlightenment, was not unique to the Golden Dawn, the GoldenDawn was nonetheless instrumental in defining it and placing it in thecontext of an initiator y system.Another significant part of the legacy of the Golden Dawn to laterinitiator y societies was that men and women were admitted on an equalbasis. Even though women could become members of certain masonicinitiator y societies already during the eighteenth centur y, it was still anuncommon practice during the end of the nineteenth centur y to allowwomen to join initiator y societies. The Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawnchallenged the existing circumstances of the day and opened—definitely—the world of Western esoteric rituals of initiation for womenin an unprecedented way. In that sense, at least, the Golden Dawn canbe seen as a forerunner to such initiator y societies as the Ordo TempliOrientisand the witchcraft movement of the 1950s."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Chapter 7Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaGerald Gardner and the Birth of WiccaIn the mid-1950s British media reported that witchcraft was by no meansan extinct tradition, but a living and flourishing form of religion prac-ticed in modern Britain. Most of the reports centered on the author andself-styled witch, Gerald B. Gardner (1884–1964), who had caught theattention of the public through his book Witchcraft Today, published in1954. The book was followed by The Meaning of Witchcraft in 1959. Inthese two books Gardner claimed that witchcraft actually was a pagan,pre-Christian religion that had sur vived through the centuries as a se-cret tradition, despite efforts of the church to destroy it during the witchtrials in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. According to Gardner,the religious tradition of witchcraft centered on the worship of two dei-ties, a goddess and a horned god, often called Aradia and Cernunnos.The religious practices described were essentially those of fertility wor-ship and magical rituals.1Furthermore, the witches were organized in small groups, calledcovens, into which new members were admitted through rituals of ini-tiation. Gardner himself claimed to have been initiated into such a covenin New Forest, 1939.2 Gardner’s description of witchcraft was not pre-sented from the standpoint of a modern witch, but as that of an anthro-pologist who had stumbled across a hitherto unknown tradition. Un-known, that is, as a still living tradition, for the idea that the victims ofthe witch-persecutions were adherents of a sur vival of a pagan fertilitycult had been suggested earlier by the scholar Margaret A. Murray(1862–1963) in The Witch Cult in Western Europe (1921), and The Godof the Witches (1933). Many of the witchcraft practices described byMurray, such as the worship of a goddess and a horned god, the orga-nization of members in covens, the use of initiation rituals and ritualized145"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationsex, were later included in Gardner’s concept of modern witchcraft.Murray’s theor y was, however, heavily criticized by her fellow scholars,and in the 1950s when Gardner’s two books were published, the theor yof a sur viving pagan fertility cult was sharply repudiated by the aca-demic world. But this did not deter Gardner from basing his books toa large extent on Murray’s work—in fact, she even wrote the preface toWitchcraft Today.Gardner began to initiate members into his coven, and soon enoughsome of these set up covens of their own all over Britain. With Gardnerdead by 1964, some of the witches initiated by Gardner assumed leadingpositions in the witchcraft movement, but the perhaps most influential,and certainly the most public relations–minded, witch of the 1960s andearly 1970s, was not initiated by Gardner. Alex Sanders (1926–1988),who called himself the King of the Witches, claimed that he had beeninitiated by his grandmother into witchcraft at an early age, and that thetradition he represented was far more genuine than the one derivingfrom Gardner.3 Together with Maxine Morris, with whom he married in1965, Alex Sanders figured prominently in media as a self-appointedrepresentative for the witchcraft movement. Sanders’ flirtation with themedia, and some of his more flamboyant claims, resulted in a rift withthe Gardnerians.4 It is now, however, generally accepted that much ofSanders’ knowledge of witchcraft derived from Gardner via one ofGardner’s High Priestesses, and that his Book of Shadows actually wasa Gardnerian one. The differences between Gardnerian and Alexandrianwitchcraft are minor, especially those in the rituals of initiation.5Both the Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions spread to the UnitedStates in the 1960s and 1970s. Here witchcraft became a much largermovement than in Britain. The decidedly most characteristic form ofwitchcraft that developed in the United States was connected to radicalfeminism. Feminists, such as Mar y Daly, criticized Christianity for beingan upholder of patriarchal oppression, and many feminists turned toalternative religious traditions. A large number of them were attractedby the importance given to the Goddess in the witchcraft movement,and a feminist form of witchcraft gradually evolved, with such authorsas Starhawk and Zsuzsanna Budapest as front figures. One branch ofthis feminist form of witchcraft did away with the horned God entirely,and became known as the Goddess movement.6Witchcraft, or Wicca, is by many scholars seen as a new religiousmovement that is today an established part of Western religiosity—showing no tendencies of fading away. One author estimated in 1991 thenumber of adherents to the neopagan movement in the U.S. and Canadaat around 200,000, and the number of covens at around 5,000 in the U.S."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"147Modern Pagan Witchcraft or Wiccaalone.7 It is, however, important to distinguish witchcraft from neopagan-ism in general, since the witchcraft movement is only one of many newreligious movements that can be classified as neopagan. Hanegraaff, inhis discussion of the term neopaganism, points out that the term is nota modern one, but can be found in “connection with certain religiousand philosophical developments in prewar Germany.”8 He suggests thefollowing broad definition of neopaganism:As a general term, “neopaganism” covers all those modern move-ments which are, firstly, based on the conviction that whatChristianity has traditionally denounced as idolatr y and super-stition actually represents / represented a profound and mean-ingful religious worldview and, secondly, that a religious prac-tice based on this worldview can and should be revitalized inour modern world.9This actually fits ver y well with what Gardner aimed to accomplish withhis witchcraft movement. Hanegraaff raises the question of the relation-ship between Wicca and New Age. According to Hanegraaff, Wicca is a“neopagan development of traditional occultistic magic,” which, he main-tains, is not in itself a pagan movement.10 This assertion can, however,be questioned. In my opinion, the British Occultistic movement fromwhich Gardner’s Wicca originates is tightly connected to neopaganism,if not from an emic perspective, then most definitely from an etic one.11For instance, the rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (seechapter 6), can, at least to a certain extent, be seen as an attempt to re-create the initiatic rituals of pre-Christian, pagan Greece and Egypt.12This can also be seen from the writings of some of its members, suchasEgyptian Magic (1896) by Florence Farr. Further, the new religiousmovement promulgated by Aleister Crowley, Thelema, was considered,at least to a certain extent, to be a reconstruction of the old Sumerianreligion.13 The writings of Dion Fortune (1891–1946), another influentialauthor of the Occultistic genre, also show clear traces of neopaganismin the form of what she considered to be pagan Celtic practices.14According to Hanegraaff, Gardner’s Wicca was a “relatively self-contained, England-based occultist religion,” but when it spread to theUnited States in the 1960s it was “interpreted and developed in increas-ingly unorthodox and syncretistic directions.”15 It was especially withthe movement known as “women’s spirituality” that Wicca intermingled,which gave birth to the Goddess Movement mentioned above. Thissyncretistic form of Wicca has adopted many of the beliefs, practicesand to a certain extent the vocabular y of the New Age movement."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"148Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationFor many witches, both in the United States and Europe, the useof rituals of initiation is an intrinsic part of the craft: for some self-initiation is a valid option,16 whereas for others the strict adherence to aninitiatic tradition is of crucial importance, usually going back to eitherGerald Gardner (Gardnerian witchcraft) or Alex Sanders (Alexandrianwitchcraft). Rituals of initiation are thus an important aspect of the modernwitchcraft movement—a fact that warrants a closer look into the natureof these rituals.The Crowley ConnectionThe relationship between Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley has beenthe source of much speculation, and to a certain extent controversy,among authors writing about the witchcraft movement. The influence ofCrowley on the early versions of the rituals of initiations in the GardnerianBook of Shadows is apparent to anyone familiar with Crowley’s publishedwritings.17 It is therefore understandable that many witches accepted theclaim made by Francis King in 1970, that Crowley had written the ritualsof initiation for Gardner’s movement. In discussing the relationshipbetween Gardner and Crowley, King wrote:He [Gerald Gardner] had known Aleister Crowley for some time,for he was not only a VII° initiate of the O.T.O. but actually helda Charter authorising him to operate some sort of O.T.O.Lodge—although, in fact, he never seems to have done this. Heaccordingly hired Crowley, at a generous fee, to write elaboraterituals for the new ‘Gardnerian’ witch-cult and, at about the sametime, either forged, or procured to be forged, the so-called Bookof Shadows, allegedly a sixteenth-centur y witches rulebook, butbetraying its modern origins in ever y line of its unsatisfactor ypastiche of Elizabethan English.18While King was correct in stating that Gardner had been a member ofthe Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)., he mistook his degree in the or-der—Gardner had the IV° (Perfect Initiate), not the VII° (SovereignGrand Inspector General). The reason for King’s mistake can possiblybe attributed to the fact that Gardner himself seems to have had prob-lems with the degree system of the O.T.O.19 Furthermore, Gardner didin fact receive a charter from Crowley to operate a Camp (not a Lodge)of the order in London, working the Miner val degree only.20 It appearsthat Gardner tried to set up a camp in London before Crowley’s deathin 1947, and that some of Crowley’s followers actually believed that"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"149Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaGardner was the head of O.T.O. in England after Crowley’s death.Gardner, however, seems to have lost his interest in the O.T.O. andinstead focused his attention on the development of the Witchcraftmovement as evidenced by the publishing of High Magic’s Aid in 1949.That Gardner lost interest in the O.T.O. is also demonstrated by the factthat his name is not even mentioned in the Manifesto of the BritishBranch of the Ordo Templi Orientis published in 1948 by Kenneth Grant(b. 1924).21 Grant was Crowley’s secretar y in the early 1940s, and he wasalso personally acquainted with Gardner in the 1950s.22 As Grant knewboth Crowley and Gardner, and was also actively involved with the O.T.O.,his testimony on the relationship between the two men is important asa first-hand witness:There have always been doubts about the claims made by somewriters concerning the production by Aleister Crowley of ritualsfor Dr. Gardner’s witch-cult. Both men were worlds apart intheir intellectual and occult pursuits. Although they met, noth-ing substantial transpired between them. It is true that A. C.admitted Dr. G. to the O.T.O. (Outer Court) in 1947, but it isevident from Dr. G’s novel, ‘High Magic’s Aid’ that he confused,on the title page, the two Orders O.T.O. and A\\A\\, and mis-took the IV°, O.T.O.,—which A. C. had conferred upon him—for 4° = 7\u0002 of the other Order! It is also true that Dr. G. appro-priated and paraphrased particular passages of A.C.’s writings(‘Book of the Law,’ in particular), but this does not amount toA.C.’s having written rituals for the witch-cult. However, pleasedo not gather from these remarks that I have no regard for Dr.G’s achievements. I knew him and liked him; he was a fascinat-ing character, and I believe that he would have repudiated a lotof the nonsense that some of his followers have lain at his doorà propos of his dealings with A.C.23TheOrdo Templi Orientis, or the Order of the Oriental Templars, wasfounded in Germany around 1912 by Theodore Reuss (1855–1923)24 onthe basis of a charter issued by John Yarker (1833–1913)25 on Septem-ber 24, 1902. The Charter was for an irregular masonic Rite called “Antientand Primitive Rite of Freemasonr y,” consisting of 33 degrees.26 The trans-formation of this Rite in Germany into O.T.O. seems to have been agradual affair, probably prompted by the fact that Reuss wanted to allowwomen into the order, something that would have been unthinkable toYarker.

This secret was kept closely hidden from the publicin the early years of the O.T.O., but in 1912 the nature of the centralsecret of the order was announced to the public:Our Order possess the Key which opens up all Masonic andHermetic secrets, namely, the teaching of sexual magic, and thisteaching explains, without exception, all the secrets of Nature, allthe symbolism of Freemasonr y and all systems of religion.27Reuss had heard about Crowley in 1910 in connection with a much-publicized trial. Crowley was printing the rituals of the Hermetic Orderof the Golden Dawn in his bi-annual publication, The Equinox, and hehad announced that the March 1910 issue would include the SecondOrder rituals. MacGregor Mathers tried to restrain the publication bysuing Crowley, to no avail. According to Crowley’s autobiography hereceived letters from all over Europe as a result of this trial, and manyhonorar y degrees from a number of esoteric organizations.28 One of thepeople who contacted Crowley was Reuss, who called on him in Londonand conferred upon him the VII° of the O.T.O. Crowley was apparentlynot overly impressed with Reuss, and thought little of this degree.However, later Reuss reappeared at Crowley’s door and accused him ofexposing the secrets of the order in one of his published books, TheBook of Lies.29 Crowley denied that he had done so, with the argumentthat he was not informed of the secrets that he was supposed to haverevealed. Reuss then promptly elevated Crowley to the IX° and therebyswore him to secrecy regarding the central secret of the O.T.O.This Art was communicated to me in June, An. VIII [1912], in by the O.H.O.30 It was practised by me in a desultor y wayuntil An. IX in 10°[1 Januar y 1914] when I made the Ex-periments recorded elsewhere of the Art derived from and par-allel to this. The Knowledge thus gained enabled me to makefurther research with more acumen and directness, so that Iwas able definitely to assert that I had produced certain resultsat will. For example, my bronchitis, which had been most intrac-table was cured in a single day. I obtained money when needed.I obtained ‘sex-force and sex-attraction’ so strongly that formonths after I was never at a loss. Better than all, I was able toexcite my art-creative power and my magical intuition so thatmuch of the ver y great work done by me all this summer maybe considered due entirely to this Art.31"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"151Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaFrom that year on, Crowley experimented with sexual magic and hisdiaries, both published and unpublished, show that he kept a carefulrecord of all “operations,” stating the object; partner(s); quality of the“elixir”; and the apparent results. In 1923 Crowley assumed the of fice asthe worldwide chief of the O.T.O., or Outer Head of the Order as theoffice was officially known. The use of sex in magical and religiousrituals fitted well with the principles of Thelema, a new religious move-ment of which Crowley was the prophet. In 1904 Crowley had “chan-neled” a text known as The Book of the Law, which he later technicallylabeledLiber AL vel Legis.32 According to Crowley, this text proved to bethe foundation of a new religion and it identified Crowley as its prophet,the Beast 666. Thelemic doctrines were incorporated in the revised ritu-als of the O.T.O. that Crowley wrote at the request of Reuss during hisstay in the U.S. during WWI.Gerald Gardner had been working for the commercial branch ofthe British Ser vice in the Far East, and for a period he had been sta-tioned in Malaysia where he worked as an overseer of a rubber planta-tion. During his time in the East, Gardner had joined Co-Masonr y andbeen “exalted” to its Royal Arch degree.33 Co-Masonr y is a version ofmasonr y that admits both men and women on an equal basis. In mostEnglish-speaking countries its rituals are infused with theosophical ideas,34since Annie Besant (1847–1933), who was (since 1907) President of theTheosophical Society, was also—since 1909—Lieutenant Grand Com-mander (= Deputy Grand Master) of the “Ordre Maçonnique MixteInternational ‘Le Droit Humain,’ ” as well as Grand Commander (= GrandMaster) of the British Federation of that Order. Upon Gardner’s returnto England in 1936 he moved in theosophical and co-masonic circles,and subsequently got involved with the “Rosicrucian Theatre,” whichwas directed by Annie Besant’s daughter. Gardner’s familiarity with therituals of Co-Masonr y, and theosophy in general, might explain his laterinterest in the O.T.O. and Thelema. As Martin P. Starr has pointed out,there were many similarities between the pre-WWII theosophical andthelemic movements:Despite all the one-sided invective, the parallels between The-osophy and Thelema as developed in Crowley’s O.T.O. werenumerous. In keeping with the First Object of the T.S. [Theo-sophical Society], its Lodges and allied orders of the ThirdSection, such as the Co-Masonic Order, admitted men andwomen on an equal basis, as did the O.T.O. They both hadconnections to John Yarker, the Grand Hierophant of the Antient"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"152Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiation& Primitive Rite and a perennial thorn in the side of the Ancientand Accepted Rite. Blavatsky had been made a member ofYarker’s Rite of Adoption in 1877. The Co-Masons attempted toseize control of the Sovereign Sanctuar y of the Antient & Primi-tive Rite in England after Yarker’s death in March 1913, butthey were thwarted by Crowley and Reuss as detailed in theSeptember issue of The Equinox. Both the Co-Masonic Orderand the O.T.O. used rituals adopted from Regular Freemasonr ywhile believing themselves to be more spiritual in aim than theirsource. They each had their own church, the Liberal Catholic(founded 1916) and the Gnostic Catholic (of uncertain founda-tion). Post-Blavatsky Theosophists like Leadbeater saw the de-grees of their fraternal society to be parallels to the orders intheir church. And behind both the Co-Masonic Order and theO.T.O. were oath-bound bodies devoted to “the investigation theunexplained laws of Nature and the psychical powers latent inman,” the E.S., the Second Section of the movement, and theOrder of the A\\A\\35 [. . .] Although their oaths were quitedisparate in nature, the first level in both the E.S. [EsotericSection] and the A\\A\\was that of a Probationer. Perhaps mostsignificantly, they each fostered the belief in a World Teacher,embodied in Krishnamurti (Alcyone) and Crowley (Therion),and in a World Religion (despite disclaimers), Theosophy andThelema. The movements were ultimately led by invisible supe-riors. The Theosophists had their Mahatmas who communicatedregularly via their precipitated letters to the T.S. elite. TheThelemites had their Secret Chiefs, some discarnate like Aiwass,to whom Crowley attributed the authorship of The Book of theLaw, and some seemingly present in the flesh; they too spokethrough their sole authorized messenger, Aleister Crowley.36To what extent was Gardner influenced by Crowley when he decided toinclude a sexual union between the initiator and the initiate in the ThirdDegree of the witchcraft rituals? It is obvious that both men shared theidea that sex could be seen as a sacred act, but it is questionable whetherGardner shared Crowley’s conviction that sex could be used in a willedact of magic, or indeed if Gardner ever had access to the secrets of theSanctuar y of the Gnosis of the O.T.O. As a Fourth degree member ofthe O.T.O. Gardner was not formally entitled to knowledge of the su-preme secrets of the O.T.O., but that does not necessarily mean thatCrowley did not entrust him with documents of instruction in sexualmagic. It is known that Crowley did not put too much emphasis on"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"153Modern Pagan Witchcraft or Wiccadegrees toward the end of his life. However, the textual analysis ofGardner’s dif ferent versions of the Book of Shadows made by Kelly37shows that all the borrowings from Crowley are taken from publishedsources—most notably The Book of the Law andEcclesiae GnosticaeCatholicae Canon Missae. Significantly enough, there are no referencesto, or quotations from, the instructional papers in sexual magic thatCrowley wrote, such as De Arte Magica, Agape vel Liber C vel Azoth andEmblems and Mode of Use.38 Furthermore, it needs to be emphasizedthat use of sex is not to be found in the rituals of the O.T.O.—in fact,there are no rituals of initiation for the highest degrees where sexualmagic is being taught: only documents of instruction. The sexual magicof the O.T.O. was initially confined to the Eighth and Ninth degrees. Inthe Eight degree, Perfect Pontiff of the Illuminati, the initiate was in-structed in the practice of auto-sexual magic, or masturbation. In theNinth degree, Initiate of the Sanctuar y of the Gnosis, the initiate wastaught a particular form of magic, which involved sexual intercourse.Crowley would later include an Eleventh degree concerned with analintercourse. One significant characteristic of the O.T.O. version of sexualmagic is the sacramental consumption of the so-called elixir (in theNinth degree the elixir consists of a mixture of male and female sexualfluids, gathered from the vagina). In Gardner’s witchcraft rituals thereare no references to masturbation or anal intercourse, and, as Valientehas obser ved, Gardner did not include the sacramental consumption ofthe elixir.39 If anything, it appears that Gardner’s use of sex in the ThirdDegree had a different purpose and had more to do with his attempt tore-create a fertility cult, rather than the performing of an act of sexualmagic in Crowley’s sense.Gardner and the Witchcraft Rituals of InitiationVarious authors have made a detailed analysis of the origins of theneopagan witchcraft movement: with special attention to the sourcesfrom which Gerald Gardner drew the information, which he later in-corporated in the so-called Book of Shadows.40 According to Gardner,theBook of Shadows was an ancient grimoire, or collection of ritualsthat he had received from the coven into which he claimed to havebeen initiated in 1939. The text was supposed to be secret, and eachcoven should copy out by hand its own copy, adding pertinent materialon their own. Parts of Gardner’s Book of Shadows, or versions of it,have been published several times, and accurate versions of it can noweven be found on the Internet.41 It includes sabbatic rituals for thevernal and autumnal equinoxes, the summer and winter solstices, rituals"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"154Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationfor consecration of magical weapons, various instructions, and so on.But the most important rituals, for this thesis, are the three rituals ofinitiation of neopagan witchcraft.Gardner had described the first two rituals in a fictional form in hisnovelHigh Magic’s Aid, published in 1949. He claimed that he had re-ceived permission from his coven to publish these rituals, but that notall witches were pleased with it. In this book Gardner describes the firsttwo rituals only; the third one is only hinted at.42Doreen Valiente (1922–1999), a High Priestess and close collabo-rator of Gerald Gardner, and Stewart and Janet Farrar, both whom wereinitiated by Alex Sanders, have published the Gardnerian rituals of ini-tiation based on three different versions.43 The three different versionsare called Text A,B, and C. The first version, Text A, is supposed to bethe oldest version, and it consists of “Gardner’s original rituals as copieddown from the New Forest coven which had initiated him, and amended,expanded or annotated by himself.”44 The Farrars state that Gardner’samendments were ver y much influenced by the O.T.O. of which Gardnerhad been a member. Text B is a later version used by Gardner in 1953.The last version, Text C, is the final version, which Gardner and DoreenValiente composed together, in which much of the Crowley and O.T.O.–related material was eliminated. Many new passages were included, mostof which were written by Valiente. In my analysis of the rituals I have toa large extent availed myself of the rituals as described by the Farrars,but as far as possible tried to focus on Texts A and B as these versionscan be considered to be the “original” ones, as far as it is possible to callany of the Gardnerian texts original. Gardner seems to have revised theBook of Shadows as an ongoing process, adding new material withoutindicating when this was done.Aidan A. Kelly has made the most thorough textual analysis ofGardner’s Book of Shadows so far, and established that the text wentthrough several revisions.45 According to Kelly, the three versions hepublished in Crafting the Art of Magic correspond to the three textversions of the Farrars: The Book of Shadows of 1949 to Text A,The Bookof Shadows of 1953 to Text B, and finally The Book of Shadows of 1957toText C.46Kelly has managed to locate and analyze what can be called the“proto-type” of the Book of Shadows, a handwritten manuscript entitled“Ye Bok of ye Art Magical.” In this manuscript Gardner copied downportions from published occultistic books, most notably from Crowley’sMagick in Theory and Practice (1930) and the medieval grimoire TheGreater Key of Solomon (1907 2nd ed.), which was translated into Englishfrom French and Latin sources and published by MacGregor Mathers."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"155Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaThe reader is referred to Kelly’s indispensable work for a concisetextual analysis of Gardner’s three rituals of initiation in which he iden-tifies the precise passages from works used by Gardner in creatingthe rituals.47First Degree: Witch and Priestess/PriestJust as all other Western esoteric rituals of initiation, the three GardnerianWicca rituals of initiation begin with a formalized opening. The openingis identical for all the three rituals, and it consists of a so-called “Castingof the Circle.” The Casting of the Circle is actually a ritual in itself,which is used not only in connection with the rituals of initiation, but inconnection with all other important Wicca rituals as well.The three major aspects of the Casting of the Circle are the “Sum-moning of the Watchtowers,” “Calling down the Moon,” and the “Charge.”The ritual is performed by the High Priest and High Priestess, while theother members of the coven initially wait outside the circle, on its north-east side. After a ritual exorcism and blessing in the names of Cernunnosand Aradia, performed by the High Priestess and High Priest, the HighPriest leaves the circle to join the other members. The High Priestessthen “casts” the circle by pointing the sword at the perimeter and pro-ceeding clockwise from north to north, saying:I conjure thee, O Circle of Power, that thou beest a meeting-placeof love and joy and truth; a shield against all wickedness and evil;a boundary between the world of men and the realms of the MightyOnes; a rampart and protection that shall preserve and containthe power that we shall raise within thee. Wherefore I bless theeand consecrate thee, in the names of Cernunnos and Aradia.48At the northeast she lets the members enter the circle, beginning withthe High Priest. Men and women admit women and men with a kiss,respectively. When all have entered the circle, the High Priestess closesit with the sword. Then three witches, named by the High Priestess inturn, carr y a bowl of water, a smoking incense burner, and a lightedcandle from the altar round the circle. The High Priestess draws theinvoking Pentagram of Earth in the air with the so-called athame, thatis, a dagger for ritual use. This is a standard feature of banishing/invok-ing rituals of the Golden Dawn, which Gerald Gardner most likely en-countered in the writings of Aleister Crowley, or Israel Regardie.49 TheHigh Priestess goes on to call the Watchtowers in the four directions ofthe compass, which she “summons, stirs and calls” “to witness our rites"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"156Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationand to guard the circle.” The Watchtowers correspond to the four ele-ments: east to air, south to fire, west to water, and north to earth. TheWatchtowers also derive from the magical system of the Golden Dawn.The second part of the opening consists of the “Drawing Down ofthe Moon,” which can be interpreted as an empowerment of the HighPriestess with cosmic energy. The High Priest gives the High Priestessthe “Fivefold Kiss,” which is done in the following manner:‘Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways’ (kissingthe right foot and then the left foot).‘Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar’ (kissingthe right knee and then the left knee).‘Blessed be they [sic!] phallus [womb],’without which we wouldnot be’ (kissing just above the pubic hair).‘Blessed be thy breast, formed in strength [breasts, formed in beauty]’(kissing the right breast and then the left breast).‘Blessed be thy lips, that shall utter the Sacred Names’ (embracinghim and kissing him on the lips).50The Fivefold Kiss correlates with the Masonic Five Points of Fellowship,which Gardner undoubtedly had encountered as a Co-Mason in theMaster Mason’s degree,51 but also in the Master Magician Degree ofO.T.O. in which the “Seven Bonds of Brotherhood” are to be found asan elaborated version of the Five Points of Fellowship.52 The High Priestthen touches the High Priestess two times each on the breasts andwomb, and finally one more time on the right breast, and calls out:I invoke thee and call upon thee, Mighty Mother of us all, bringerof all fruitfulness; by seed and root, by stem and bud, by leaf andflower and fruit do I invoke thee to descend upon the body of thisthy servant and priestess.53After an adoration of the High Priestess, as Aradia, by the High Priest,the High Priestess draws the Invoking Pentagram of Earth, and says:Of the Mother darksome and divineMine the scourge, and mine the kiss;The five-point star of love and bliss—Here I charge you, in this sign.54"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"157Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaThe third part of the opening, the deliver y of the Charge, begins witha quite lengthy charge by the Great Mother, or Star Goddess, to herworshippers, pronounced by the High Priestess. Part of the charge is aparaphrase of the first chapter of Crowley’s Liber AL vel Legis. The HighPriest calls upon the “Great God Cernunnos,” the male principle. TheCharge finishes with the whole coven, circling clockwise, while chantinga hymn called the “Witches’ Rune.”The First Degree InitiationIn all three degrees of Wicca, the candidate is initiated by a person ofthe opposite sex.55 The blindfolded candidate is prepared outside thecircle, where he56 waits at the northeast, by having his wrists tied to-gether behind his back, a cord tied around the right ankle, and anotherabove the right knee. The initiator then says, “Feet neither bond norfree.” This preparation of the candidate bears close resemblance to thepreparation of the candidate in the masonic Entered Apprentice Degree,where he is prepared in the following manner:His shirt is unbuttoned and opened to expose the left breast,and the right sleeve is rolled up above the elbow. His left trou-ser leg is rolled up above the knee [. . .]. The right shoe is takenoff and replaced by a slipper (slipshod) of the “mule” type. Arope noose (cable-tow) usually of craft-blue silk is placed abouthis neck, the end hanging down his back. The Candidate isblindfolded with a ‘hoodwink’ which may be of black velvet orof craft-blue.57The words of the initiator, “Feet neither bond nor free,” are probably anallusion to masonic catechisms in which the Entered Apprentice an-swers the question what the circumstances were at his entrance. Forinstance,La Reception Mysterieuse, published in 1738, gives the follow-ing answer to the question: “This entrance was made neither naked norclothed, neither shod nor bare-foot, without any metal in a strolling &not ungainly posture.”58The candidate waits outside the circle until the Drawing Down ofthe Moon. The initiator then gives the “Cabalistic Cross,” a short ritual,which derives from the Golden Dawn, after which the Witches’ Rune,and the Charge are declaimed.59 After the initiator has asked the candi-date whether he has the courage to make the assay, as he is standingon “the threshold between the pleasant world of men and the dreaddomains of the Lords of the Outer Spaces,” she places the tip of thesword or the athame against the heart of the candidate, and says: “For"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationI say verily, it were better to rush on my blade and perish, than makethe attempt with fear in thy heart.” Again, this is a feature to be foundin the Entered Apprentice ritual where the candidate is met by the InnerGuard at the door of the Lodge, who applies the point of a poignard tohis bared left breast.60The candidate gives the two passwords “Perfect love” and “Perfecttrust,” and the initiator welcomes him inside the circle by first givinghim a kiss, and then embracing him from behind, in order to push himfor ward with her body into the circle. As in masonr y, the candidate isled around the circle, and at each cardinal point the initiator says, “Takeheed, ye Lords of the East [South, West, North] that [name] is properlyprepared to be initiated a priest [priestess] and witch.” The candidate isthen brought to the centre, and the members move round him clock-wise while chanting:Eko, Eko, Azarak,Eko, Eko, Zomelak,Eko, Eko, Cernunnos,Eko, Eko, Aradia.61The chanting goes on for a while, and the candidate is pushed back andforth between the members, until the initiator tells them to stop. This isa common feature in many non-Western rituals of initiation, but it is alsoevident that the effect of disorienting and scaring the candidate wasstrived at in masonic rituals during the eighteenth centur y to a muchlarger extent than in later ones. The candidate is then directed to facethe altar, and the initiator kneels and gives the Fivefold Kiss. After thishas been done, the initiator takes the candidate’s “measure”:The Initiator, with the help of another witch of the same sex,stretches the twine from the ground at the Postulant’s feet tothe crown of his head, and cuts this length off with the white-handled knife (which her Partner brings her). She then mea-sures him once round the forehead and tied [sic!] a knot tomark the measurements; once (from the same end) round theheart, and ties a knot; and once round the hips across the geni-tals, and ties a knot. She winds up the measure and lays it onthe altar.62The ordeal consists of a ritual whipping with a scourge, performed bythe initiator. The candidate is instructed to kneel, with head bowed andshoulders for ward. His ankles and knees are bound together. A total"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"159Modern Pagan Witchcraft or Wiccaamount of forty strokes are given. It is explicitly stated that the purposeof the ordeal is to purify the candidate.After the ordeal follows the Oath, which closely resembles themasonic Oaths. The candidate is first asked if he is ready to swear thathe will “always be true to the Art,” and that he will protect and defendhis “bothers and sisters of the Art.” Giving an affirmative answer tothese questions, he then repeats the Oath, which the initiator spells outfor him, phrase by phrase:I,[name], in the presence of the Mighty Ones, do of my own freewill and accord most solemnly swear that I will keep secret andnever reveal the secrets of the Art, except it be to a proper person,properly prepared within a Circle such as I am now in; and thatI will never deny the secrets to such a person if he or she beproperly vouched for by a brother or sister of the Art. All this Iswear by my hopes of a future life, mindful that my measure hasbeen taken; and may my weapons turn against me if I break thismy solemn oath.63The candidate then receives the Triple Sign, which is given by the Ini-tiator in three parts. First, the candidate is consecrated with oil by theinitiator who touches him with oil just above the pubic hair, on the rightand left breasts, and above the pubic hair again. Second, he is anointedwith wine on the same spots. Third, he is consecrated with kisses in thesame places. This so-called Triple Sign is connected to the special em-blem of this degree, the inverted triangle. When the Triple Sign hasbeen given, the blindfold is removed and the candidate is untied. Thecandidate is now an initiated witch and the members of the coven wel-come him with either kisses or handshakes.The ritual then proceeds with the instruction of the secrets of thedegree, which consists of the working tools. This practice is a commonfeature in masonic rituals of initiation, and it is interesting to note that theritual paraphernalia of Freemasonr y is also called “working tools.” Thetools are presented to the newly made witch, one by one, with a kiss.Now I present to thee the Working Tools. First, the Magic Sword.With this, as with the Athame, thou canst form all Magic Circles,dominate, subdue and punish all rebellious spirits and demons,and even persuade angels and good spirits. With this in thy hand,thou art the ruler of the Circle.Next I present the Athame. This is the true witch’s weapon,and has all the powers of the Magic Sword."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"160Western Esotericism and Rituals of InitiationNext I present the White-hilted Knife. Its use is to form allinstruments used in the Art. It can only be used in a Magic Circle.Next I present the Wand.

This is used to encour-age and welcome good spirits and to banish evil spirits.Next I present the Scourge. This is the sign of power anddomination. It is also to cause purification and enlightenment. [...]Next and lastly I present the Cords. They are of use to bindthe sigils in the Art; also the material basis; also they are neces-sary in the Oath.64The initiator then gives the candidate one final kiss, and says “I nowsalute thee in the name of Aradia, newly made priest[ess] and witch.”The ritual ends with a formal proclamation of the new witch, which isdone at each of the cardinal points in the circle:Hear ye Mighty Ones of the East [South, West, North];[name]has been consecrated priest[ess], witch and hidden child ofthe Goddess.65Second Degree: High Priestess/High PriestThe ritual of the second degree closely follows the one of the first de-gree, in both structure and content. After the usual opening (Casting ofthe Circle, etc.), the candidate stands bound and blindfolded in the centerof the circle. The initiator takes him around the circle, and at eachcardinal point proclaims: “Hear, ye Mighty Ones of the East [etc.] [or-dinar y name], a duly consecrated Priest[ess] and Witch, is now properlyprepared to be made a High Priest and Magus [High Priestess andWitch Queen].”66 The candidate is then led back to the middle of thecircle, after which the coven links hands and circles around him threetimes. With the consent of the initiate, he then undergoes the ordeal ofbeing whipped by the initiator with a scourge of forty strokes.After the ordeal, the initiate is given a new name that he or she haschosen beforehand, a so-called witch name. According to Janet and"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"161Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaStewart Farrar the name should be chosen with thoughtful consider-ation, and it can be either a God- or Goddess-name, the name of ahistorical or mythical person, or even a “synthetic name made up of theinitial letters of aspects which create a balance desirable to the initiate(a process drawn from a certain kind of ritual magic).”67 The use of aspecial name or motto is a common feature in British occultism, and itwas for instance a standard practice in the Golden Dawn. Gardner wasundoubtedly familiar with this practice, as is demonstrated by the titlepage of his novel High Magic’s Aid, published in 1949, where he printshis magical name as a member of the O.T.O.—Scire.68 The new name isimprinted on the mind of the candidate as each member of the covengives him a light smack or push while asking what his name is.The name-giving rite is followed by the taking of the oath:Repeat thy new name after me, saying: “I [name], swear upon mymother’s womb, and mine honour among men and my Brothersand Sisters of the Art, that I will never reveal, to any at all, anyof the secrets of the Art, except it be to a worthy person, properlyprepared, in the centre of a Magic Circle such as I am now in.This I swear by my hopes of salvation, my past lives, and my hopesof future ones to come; and I devote myself and my measure toutter destruction if I break this my solemn oath.”69After the Oath follows a peculiar practice in which the initiator “wills allher or his power into the initiate.”The Initiator kneels beside the Initiate and places her left handunder his knee and her right hand on his head, to form theMagic Link.She Says:‘I will all my power into thee.’Keeping her hands in the Magical Link position, she con-centrates for as long as she feels necessar y on willing all herpower into the Initiate.70As in the first degree ritual, the initiator then consecrates the initiate withoil, wine, and kisses. But this time on the spots that correspond to theinverted pentagram of the second degree: just above the pubic hair, onthe right breast, on the left hip, on the right hip, on the left breast, andfinally just above the pubic hair again. The initiate is untied and the blind-fold is removed. The members of the coven congratulate him in turn,either with a kiss or a handshake. The nine tools of witchcraft are then"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"162Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationpresented as in the first degree, but this time the initiate is instructed toperform a short ritual act with each of the tools in turn. For instance,when he is presented with the magic sword, he “re-casts” the circle. Thelast item to be presented, the scourge, is followed by the words:Ninth, the Scourge. For learn, in Witchcraft you must ever give asyou receive, but ever triple. So where I gave thee three, returnnine; where I gave seven, return twenty-one; where I gave nine,return twenty-seven; where I gave twenty-one, return sixty-three.71The candidate gives the initiator a total amount of one hundred twentystrokes with the scourge. Finally, the candidate is being led round thecircle by the initiator, who proclaims at each cardinal point: “Hear, yeMighty Ones of the East [etc.]: [witch name] has been duly consecratedHigh Priest and Magus [High Priestess and Witch Queen].”The second degree ritual ends with the narration of “The Legendof the Descent of the Goddess,” which can be ritually enacted. If thelegend is enacted, the part of the Goddess, the Lord of the Under world,and the Guardian of the Portals are acted out by members of the coven—usually the initiate acts either as the Goddess (if female) or the Lord ofthe Under world (if male). In brief, the legend consists of a stor y inwhich the Goddess descends to the Under world, the realm of the dead,which is governed by the Lord of the Under world. At the Portals to theunder world the Guardians challenge her, and order her to strip off hergarments and lay aside her jewelr y, since one is not allowed to bringanything to the under world. The Lord of the Under world, Death him-self, fell in love with the Goddess, and asked her to stay with him in theunder world, but the Goddess answered that she did not love him andthat she would rather receive Death’s scourge. As the Lord of the Un-der world scourged her tenderly, she cried out: “I feel the pangs of love!”Death answers, “Blessed be!” and gives her the Fivefold Kiss, and thenteaches her all the mysteries, “and they loved and were one.” The moralof the stor y is described at the end of the narration:For there are three great events in the life of man: Love, Death,and Resurrection in the new body; and Magic controls them all.For to fulfil love you must return again at the same time andplace as the loved one, and you must remember and love themagain. But to be reborn you must die and be ready for a newbody; and to die you must be born; and without love you maynot be born; and this is all the Magics [sic!].72"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"163Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaNo explanations of the meaning of the legend are given in the threeversions of the Book of Shadows, but the legend resembles many antiquemyths, such as those of Inanna and Demeter. There are numerous mythsassociated with the Sumerian deity Inanna, later known as Ishtar by theAkkadians and the Assyro-Babylonians. The myths, which resemble “TheLegend of the Descent of the Goddess,” can be found in the SumerianInnana’s Descent to the Netherworld and the Akkadian Ishtar’s Descent.These myths centers around the theme of love and death, and the loversof Innana and Ishtar, that is, Dumuzi and Tammuz, represent the annualdying and regenerated vegetative cycle. The goddesses, in their turn,represent the embodiment of the generative force in nature. Further-more, the intercourse of the gods was ritually enacted in an annual ritein which “the king, representing Dumuzi-Tammuz, entered into a hierosgamos, a sacred marriage, with a sacred temple prostitute, representingInnana-Ishtar, and thus sympathetically brought regeneration to theland.”73 It seems to me likely that Gardner was influenced by this allegedpractice when he composed the Third Degree ritual, which includessexual intercourse between the initiator and the candidate. The Greekmyth of Demeter and Persephone (Kore) has a similar theme in whichPersephone’s annual stay (for four months) in the underworld togetherwith Hades symbolizes the unfertile winter. The cult of Demeter has itsmost famous expression in the Eleusinian Mysteries.Another possible parallel is to be found in “the dying and resur-recting gods” of Frazer’s The Golden Bough. According to Frazer, a largeportion of the Mediterranean gods of antiquity was modeled on thetheme of death and resurrection. He offered two explanations to thistheme; the euhemeristic and the natural theor y, respectively. Theeuhemeristic theor y offers the explanation that the gods actually havetheir origin in one or more powerful kings that were killed by theirsubjects when their potency dwindled due to old age. The natural theor ytakes a different approach and explains the dying and resurrecting godsas personifications of the yearly cycle of vegetation. The two possibilitiesof interpretation that Frazer offers are connected to the idea that deathfollows when fertility wanes, and that the period of sterility is followed byrejuvenation. Gardner, who was familiar with The Golden Bough, probablyconsidered these explanations as strengthening his own arguments ofwitchcraft as a pagan fertility religion with its roots in remotest antiquity.Mention should also be made to the parallel of “The Legend of theDescent of the Goddess” to the masonic legend of the Third Degree,that is, the Hiramic legend. Gardner was familiar with the legend ofHiram both as a member of Co-Masonr y, and of the O.T.O. In the revised"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"164Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiation1917 O.T.O. rituals of Crowley, Hiram is exchanged for Mansurel-Hallaj, in full Abu al-Mughith al-Husayn ibn Mansur al-Hallaj (858–922), the Sufi mystic.74 The legend of Hiram, discussed in chapter 4,deals with the theme of death and resurrection, which is a commonfeature in rituals of initiation. The chief difference between the masoniclegend, and that of the witchcraft second degree, is that Hiram (andMansur el-Hallaj in the case of the O.T.O.) is slain, whereas the Goddessin the witchcraft legend embraces death out of love for the “Lord of theUnder world.”Third Degree: High Priestess/High PriestThe third degree ritual differs, both in structure and content, from thetwo previous rituals, and thus also from Western esoteric rituals in gen-eral.75 Standard features such as the taking of an obligation, circumam-bulations round the circle/temple, and instructions in the secrets of thedegree, are marked by their absence. On the other hand, the ritualincludes a feature that, to my knowledge, was new in the whole corpusof Western esoteric rituals of initiation in the 1950s when the ritual wascomposed by Gerald Gardner. This unique feature is called the GreatRite and consists of a sexual union of the candidate and the initiator. Thecandidate, if female, assumes the role of the Priestess, or, if male, thatof the Priest.Following the customar y opening, the Priestess seats herself onthe altar, or if the altar is too small, on a throne. She sits in the charac-teristic position of Osiris with wrists crossed in front of her chest, hold-ing the athame in her right hand, and the scourge in her left. The Priestkneels before her in the same manner as the Priest kneels before thePriestess in Crowley’s Gnostic Mass, that is, with his arms along herthighs and head bowed to her knees. After a short period of adoration,the Priest rises and brings the filled chalice, which he hands to thePriestess, and then resumes his kneeling position. She lowers the pointof the athame into the wine,76 and says: “As the athame is [to] the male,so is the cup [to] the female; and conjoined, they bring blessedness.”77She kisses the Priest, drinks from the chalice, and with a kiss passes thechalice to him. The Priest drinks, and gives the chalice to a femalemember of the coven with a kiss, who drinks, and then passes it on toa male member with a kiss. This is repeated until all members havepartaken of the chalice. This part of the ritual clearly inspired by Crowley’sGnostic Mass.78The Priest offers a paten with cakes, and the Priestess toucheseach cake with the moistened tip of her athame, as the Priest says:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"165Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaO Queen most secret, bless this food unto our bodies, bestowinghealth, wealth, strength, joy and peace, and that fulfilment of Will,and Love under Will, which is perpetual happiness.79The Priestess, Priest and members of the coven each take a cake in thesame manner as the chalice. The Priest then adores the Priestess asbefore, by kissing her knees, folding his arms along her thighs, andbowing down his head. The Priest and Priestess then proceed to purifyeach other by scourging. The Priest is the first to receive the strokes,then the Priestess, and then finally the Priest receives yet another roundof strokes.80After the scourging session, the Priest says, “Now I must reveal agreat myster y” and gives the Priestess the Fivefold Kiss. The Priestesslies down in the center of the circle, on the altar or a couch, face upward.She is positioned so as to have her vagina in the center of the circle, thesymbolic point within the circle. The Priest kneels by her side, facingnorth across her body, and says:Assist me to erect the ancient altar, at which in days past allworshipped,The Great Altar of all things;For in old times, Woman was the altar.Thus was the altar made and placed;And the sacred point was the point within the centre of thecircle.As we have of old been taught that the point within the centreis the origin of all things,Therefore should we adore it.

ThePriest continues:O Secret of Secrets,That art hidden in the being of all lives,Not thee do we adore,For that which adoreth is also thou.Thou art That, and That am I. [kiss]I am the flame that burns in the heart of every man,And in the core of every star.I am life, and the giver of life.Yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death.I am alone, the Lord within ourselves,Whose name is Mystery of Mysteries.83As in the two previous degrees, the Priest kisses the Priestess in theparticular pattern of the Sigil of the degree—which in the Third degreeis the upright triangle above the upright pentagram. It is given in thefollowing manner: “above the pubic hair, on the right foot, on the leftknee, on the right knee, on the left foot, and above the pubic hair again;then on the lips, the left breast, the right breast and finally the lipsagain.”84 The Priest lays his body over the Priestess’s and says:Make open the path of intelligence between us;For these truly are the Five Points of Fellowship—Foot to foot,Knee to knee,Lance to Grail,85Breast to breast,Lips to lips."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"167Modern Pagan Witchcraft or WiccaBy the great and holy name Cernunnos;In the name of Aradia;Encourage our hearts,Let the light crystallize itself in our blood,Fulfilling of us resurrection.For there is no part of us that is not part of the Gods.86The Priest then rises, while the Priestess remains laying down, and goesto each of the cardinal points and proclaims: “Ye Lords of the Watchtow-ers of the East [South, West, North]; the thrice consecrated High Priest-ess greets you and thanks you.”87Concluding RemarksThe three Gardnerian rituals of initiation are not ancient rituals pre-ser ved in secrecy from a pagan prehistor y—despite claims to the con-trar y—but modern compilations made by Gerald Gardner in the late1940s and 1950s. Large portions of these rituals have been identified astaken from previously published works, such as Mathers’s edition of TheGreater Key of Solomon. The first two rituals closely follow traditionalmasonic rituals of initiation, and include standard features such as aformalized opening, the swearing of oaths, circumambulations, hood-winks, trials, etc. The legend of the second degree, “The Legend of theDescent of the Goddess,” can be seen as a typical legend of masonicrituals, of which there is such abundance. The theme of death and res-urrection is a standard feature in most masonic systems of initiation,perhaps most famously expressed in the Hiramic legend of the MasterMason’s degree in Craft masonr y.Gardner’s third degree differs, however, significantly from othermasonic rituals of initiation, most notably by the fact that it includes a sexualunion between the initiator and the initiate. This is, to my knowledge, thefirst example of a Western esoteric ritual of initiation, which includes ritual-ized sex, at least in an actual sense. The use of sex in the initiation toHigh Priest(ess) should be understood out of Gardner’s aim at (re-)cre-ating a pagan fertility cult, and not as an act of sexual magic as practicedby Crowley and the highest initiates of the O.T.O.The legacy of Gerald Gardner to the modern witchcraft movementis decisive, but at the same time the movement is in constant changeand evolution. This is especially true regarding the rituals of initiation ofwhich there are today an incalculable number of versions.

Furthermore, focus has been directed to-ward those masonic rituals of initiation through which Westernesotericism has been transmitted. The admittedly wide historical scopeof the thesis, spanning over three centuries, asks whether it is legitimateto treat such rituals of initiation as one phenomenon. After all, what hasa modern witch to do with a mason of the eighteenth century? Actually,quite a lot.The basic components of a masonic ritual of initiation, which canbe traced even in the earliest masonic manuscript catechism, TheEdinburgh Register House MS from 1696, are constant throughout thehistor y of these rituals. In other words, both a mason and a witch wouldrecognize themselves if a ritual of initiation would be described to themas consisting of (a) a formal opening of the ritual work during which thecandidate is not present; (b) the admission of the initiate into the lodge(or circle in the case of witchcraft) at which the initiate answers a num-ber of questions, often including why he or she wants to be admitted;(c) circumambulations around the lodge room during which the initiateis led by an initiator, at which point there often occurs some form ofordeal; (d) the swearing of an oath never to divulge the traditional se-crets of the degree (such as a sign, grip, word), and to follow certainethical rules; (e) the formal admission into the degree, often proclaimedby the chief initiator in the name of the order; (f) instruction in thetraditional secrets and in the particular teachings connected to the de-gree; (g) the receiving of one or more visible tokens connected to thedegree (such as gloves, an apron, a sash), sometimes also a name or169"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"170Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationmotto; (h) finally, a formal closing of the lodge during which the initiateis present.These components constitute the skeleton, as it were, of all West-ern esoteric rituals of initiation (there are always, of course, exceptionsto a rule), and with this skeleton as a starting point, each ritual takes itsindividual form and content. As evidenced by the example of the Neo-phyte ritual of the Golden Dawn, some rituals are highly elaborate andrich in symbolical contents, while other rituals, such as the True Masonof the Rite Ecossais philosophique, are less elaborate from a ritual per-spective. Radical innovations, such as the inclusion of the practice of sexin the Gardnerian third-degree ritual, are on the whole quite rare. How-ever, once a significant innovation has been made within a particularsystem, it is likely that it will be taken over by later societies. For in-stance, the attribution of the degrees of the Golden Dawn with theSephiroth of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life is today a common featureamong occultist initiator y societies. An illustrative example of how theuse of the Tree of Life as a structural component has been adopted bya modern occultist organization, is the initiator y system of the SwedishorganizationOrdo Draconis et Atri Adamantis, more commonly knownas the Dragon Rouge. The initiator y system of the Dragon Rouge, how-ever, differs from the Golden Dawn’s in that the degrees are not attrib-uted to the Sephiroth, but to the spheres of the so-called dark side of theTree of Life, the Klippoth.1 The development of new forms of Westernesoteric rituals of initiation is an ongoing process, which as yet has notreceived any academic attention.In my introduction I stated that the present study actually consistsof two fields of research: rituals of initiation and Western esotericism.What conclusions, then, can be drawn about these two fields of researchfrom the examples of Western esoteric rituals of initiation discussed?The easiest way to answer this question is to address the two questionsposed at the outset of this study; namely, how is Western esotericismtransmitted through the esoteric rituals of initiation? And further, what“kind” of esotericism is transmitted?Esoteric discourses, including rituals, are essentially symbolic innature. This means that each ritual has to be interpreted as a whole, andit must be understood that the symbols encountered in a ritual can havedifferent meanings. To a certain extent, it is the interpreter who “de-cides” if a symbol is to be regarded as esoteric or not. For instance, agrail in a ritual can be interpreted from a traditionally Christian perspec-tive, but it can also have a wide variety of esoteric meanings to anesotericist. This problem is especially apparent in rituals connectedspecifically to Freemasonr y since Freemasonr y is not dogmatic in the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"171Conclusionssense that the symbols used in the rituals have an official meaning. Onthe contrar y, most of the symbols used in Freemasonr y have differentmeanings, and it is up to the individual mason to form his own interpre-tation of the rituals that he is undergoing.2 Nevertheless, explicit refer-ences to esotericism are easily detectable in the rituals that have beenanalyzed in this study, especially if the Craft degrees are left out. It isparticularly during the part of the ritual in which the initiate is instructedin the special teachings of the degree, that Western esotericism is ex-plicitly transmitted to the initiate. The instruction can be either in theform of a direct explanation of a certain part or aspect of the ritual, suchas the explanation of the principal symbols of the Golden Dawn Neo-phyte ritual by the Hierophant, or as a separate instruction in one ormore esoteric topics, such as the alchemical catechism at the end of theTrue Mason ritual, and the explanation of the working tools of theGardnerian witchcraft rituals.Western esoteric rituals of initiation can be regarded as mirrors ofcontemporar y esotericism as they reflect the esoteric currents and no-tions, which are in vogue at the time when the rituals were written. Therituals analyzed in this study are examples of how contemporar yesotericism has been integrated with masonic rituals of initiation. Forinstance, the rituals of the Golden Dawn epitomize the occultist teach-ings and traditions, which were current at the turn of the twentiethcentur y. It is further significant to note that most of the esoteric teach-ings that were transmitted through the rituals, and consequently wereconsidered to be secret, were not confined to the initiator y societies assuch. On the contrar y, most of the teachings were readily available tothe public in printed books, of which, for instance, the alchemical doc-trines transmitted in the True Mason ritual are clear example. There aresome significant exceptions to this rule, such as the teachings of theinner order of the Golden Dawn (e.g., the orders instructions in Enochianmagic), and the ones of the original Gardnerian rituals of initiation (e.g.,the use of sex in the third-degree initiation).Many of the esoteric symbols encountered in the rituals are of areligious or philosophical nature in the sense that they are concernedwith an “esoteric worldview”—or more correctly, a number of esotericworldviews as formulated by Christian Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism, The-osophy, Occultism, Wicca, etc. Through the rituals the initiates are thusable to reach a knowledge concerning the relationship among God,nature, and man. Scholars such as Snoek have emphasized the impor-tance placed on the experience of undergoing the rituals, and this expe-rience, connected to the knowledge of an esoteric worldview, in oneform or another, has in my opinion a direct relation to Hanegraaff’s"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"172Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiationdefinition of esotericism as gnosis, a revelator y knowledge. One furthersignificant aspect of masonic rituals of initiation in this context is theimportance placed on the individual interpretation of the ritual, not onlyduring the ritual, but also after ward. The initiates often return to theritual, not only in the capacity of officiating initiators, but as spectatorsof the ritual.The esoteric teachings are, however, not only of a religious orphilosophical nature, but also of a specifically practical nature. Theseteachings are often concentrated in the instructional part of the rituals,and can consist of such topics as alchemy, astrology, and magic. Theseinstructions can be of a general and introductor y level, such as theinstruction in the witchcraft working tools of the Gardnerian first-degreeritual, or more elaborate and advanced as in the alchemical instructionsof the True Mason ritual.Masonic rituals of initiation in general, and Western esoteric ritu-als of initiation in particular, have suffered from academic neglect far toolong, and it is hoped that this study will do something to bring thisfascinating field of research to the attention of a wider public.

It becomes amatter of making a text mean things that its author did not, one believes, thinkabout, or did not want to say explicitly.” Faivre, “The Notions of Concealmentand Secrecy in Modern Esoteric Currents since the Renaissance” (1999), 166.42. “(. . .) esotericism began to be a matter for specialists whose audiencewas likely to be comprised of those already ‘in the know’; i.e., of persons whoshared the same basic worldviews as they did themselves, and for whom essentiallythe same body of reference functioned as the object of their inquiry.” (My emphasis)Faivre & Voss, “Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions” (1992), 52.43. In discussing the notions of explicit and implicit secrecy in relation toWestern esotericism, Faivre states: “Many alchemists have interpreted the writ-ings of their predecessors by demonstrating that underneath the manifest sym-bols, other symbols and layers of meaning lay hidden. This is consistent with thefact that esoteric discourses are essentially interpretative. The exegesis of textsthat are already exegetic is supposed to be required.” (My emphasis) Faivre,“The Notions of Concealment and Secrecy in Modern Esoteric Currents sincethe Renaissance” (1999), 165.44. The interpretative nature of esoteric discourses (vide supra) requiresthat each text should be studied within its particular context. For instance,Aleister Crowley frequently employed alchemical and Rosicrucian symbols whenwriting instructions in “Sexual Magick.” The Rose and the Cross should in thisparticular context be interpreted as the Yoni and Lingam of the practitioners.Further, Crowley would interpret earlier alchemical discourses as pertaining toSexual Magick.45. An illustrative example of this is Michael Maier’s The Laws of theFraternity of the Rosie Crosse (Themis Aurea) (1656).46. The relationship between fantasy and esotericism is more complicatedthan what first meets the eye. The migration of esoteric elements is not only tobe found in fantasy literature, but also in fantasy role-playing games such asDungeons & Dragons. Based on my limited knowledge of modern practitionersof magic and Wicca it seems clear to me that many of them became interested inesotericism mainly through role-playing games. This can partly be explainedthrough the emphasis on the imaginative faculty in both esotericism and role-playing games. It is an interesting subject that deser ves to be studied more closely.47. Hanegraaff suggests that the so-called “Yates paradigm” is character-ized by two elements: the suggestion of a relatively unitar y and self-sufficient“hermetic tradition,” and an implicit dependence on modernist narratives ofsecular and scientific progress.

Or in the words of Faivre: “The question is not what esotericism wouldbe “in itself.” No doubt esotericism is not even a domain, in the sense in whichone speaks of the domains of painting, or philosophy, or chemistr y. It is, rather,a form of thought, and the point is to identify its nature, on the basis of those currentsor forms of spirituality which appear to illustrate it.” (My emphasis) Faivre, “Intro-duction 1” in Faivre and Needleman, Modern Esoteric Spirituality (1992), xi.50.

Anderson’s constitution was,however, not the first masonic constitution to be published: in 1722 the so-calledThe Old [or Robert’s]Constitutions was published. According to Piatigorsky,Robert’s and Anderson’s constitutions represent two streams of masonic opinionat the time: the Christian and the deistic, respectively. Piatigorsky, Freemasonry(1999), 45.4. The term “Accepted” probably derives from the London “Company offfreemasons” who had an additional categor y of membership, referred to as the“Acception.” It is now generally assumed among scholars that the term“freemason” is an abbreviated form of “free-stone mason,” that is, a mason workingwith “freestone.” The latter is a form of stone (both limestone and sandstone),which is free from natural faults.

I prefer to use the terms “operative” and “nonoperative” masonr y infavor of the often-used terms “operative” and “speculative” masonr y. Accordingto Hamill, the “terms Operative and Speculative are used to differentiate betweenthe old operative stonemasons and the newer free and accepted or speculativemasons.

However, the usage of the latter differentiation isproblematic, as the speculative element appears to have been important in op-erative masonr y. Stevenson comments: “The stonemasons in their ‘operative’lodges were doing ‘speculative’ things long before gentlemen non-stonemasonscame on the scene, so a terminology which insists that lodges of operativesmust be largely concerned with operative functions forces distortion on thefacts.” Stevenson, The Origins of Freemasonry (2001), 10.14.

Waite states: “We know that at Mason’sHall, a few yards from his house, a Lodge of non-operative Masons was meetingin the year 1620 and thence onward. We know that among its records was aBOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS, ‘which Mr. Fflood gave.’ It is idle to assume that thisdonor was Robertus de Fluctibus or to affirm that he was therefore a member;but again the facts offer an attractive field of speculation.” Waite, The Brother-hood of the Rosy Cross (1924), 364.

TheAcacia is a symbol of immortality and, according to Jones, “legend connects theacacia with the wood of the cross of Christ, and His crown of thorns.” It has alsobeen suggested that the Acacia is a symbol of initiation, “in the sense thatinitiation itself is symbolic of resurrection.” For further information, see Jones,Freemason’s Guide and Compendium (1994), 486–492.79.EMC (1963), 169–170.80. Perhaps the fiercest attack on Prichard’s character is found in ThePerjur’d Free Mason Detected published in 1730.

Hebrewbiblical mss were principally consonantal in spelling until well into the currentera. The pronunciation of words was transmitted in a separate oral tradition. TheTetragrammaton was not pronounced at all, the word adonay, “my Lord,” beingpronounced in its place; elohim, “God,” was substituted in cases of combinationadonay yhwh (305 times; e.g. Gen 15:2).

Waite, The Secret Tradition in Freemasonry (1911), Vol. 1, 39–40.87. Indeed, for Waite, this did not only apply to the masonic tradition, forhe firmly believed “that all mystical and hermetic traditions, from alchemy andthe Hebrew Kabbalah to the quest for the Holy Grail, contained true paths to befollowed in the quest for Mystical Union with God; and God, for Waite, is imma-nent rather than transcendent” Gilbert, A.

The dissemina-tion of this form is usually traced to Petrus Galatinus, confessor to Pope Leo X,who in 1518 A.D. transliterated the four Hebrew letters with the Latin letters jhvhtogether with the vowels of Adonai, producing the artificial form ‘Jehovah.’ ” TheAnchor Bible Dictionary (1992), Vol. VI, 1011.93.

Snoek, “The Evolution of the Hiramic Legend” (1999), 79. The bur y-ing of Hiram in the Sanctum Sanctorum can, however, be interpreted in variousways. For instance, as early 1730 there is an allegorical interpretation of this partof the ritual:Mast. Yes; and don’t they tell you Hiram was buried in the SanctumSanctorum?Jun. Yes, and he was buried there too to be sure.Mast. Yes, allegorically; but not really; the Meaning of the Figure isthis: That his Art sunk with him, was buried in the exquisite Workman-ship which he perform’d for the Temple, and was never recover’d since.For that no such Things were ever done after it, in or for any Buildingin the World.Jun. Was that the Meaning of it?Mast. Yes; for you might easily know, a dead Body to have been buriedin the Temple, would have polluted the Place, and the Jews wouldnever have come into it again. [EMC, 192]96. Moshe Idel has shown that mystical union with God is an intrinsicpart of Kabbalah, contrar y to what Gershom Scholem argued. “(. . .) I shallpropose an alternative view on expressions of unio mystica in Kabbalah: far frombeing absent, unitive descriptions recur in Kabbalistic literature no less fre-quently than in non-Jewish mystical writings, and the images used by theKabbalists do not fall short of the most extreme forms of other types of mysti-cism.” Idel, Kabbalah.

The preparation room is usually called a Chamber of Reflection, whichis often totally dark. In French rituals there are usually two rooms: the “Chambrede preparation,” and the “Chambre obscure.” After being prepared (i.e., ad-dressed and properly clothed) in the first one, the candidate is placed in thesecond room in order to meditate. Usually there is a candle burning there.71.Collectanea Vol. 6, Part 3 (1957), 210.72.Collectanea Vol. 6, Part 3 (1957), 211.73. According to Kloss XXVI.3, GON 193.C.68, the password is Mitraton.However, both Metralon and Mitraton are probably corruptions of Metraton orMetatron, the greatest of the angels in Jewish myths and legends. The functionof Metatron differs in various stories, but the most important ones are as God’smediator with men and as a guardian of heavenly secrets.74.Collectanea Vol. 6, Part 3 (1957), 213.75.Collectanea Vol. 6, Part 3 (1957), 214.76.Collectanea Vol. 6, Part 3 (1957), 214.77.

The three phases of the alchemical process, Nigredo,Albedo, and Rubedoare sometimes extended to include a fourth phase, Citrinitas or the yellow stage,considered to take place between Albedo and Rubedo. This was known alreadyby the Greek alchemists. For instance, Maria the Jewess is attributed, by Zosimusof Panopolis (late third and early fourth centuries), to be familiar with the fourphases of color transformation. Patai, “Maria the Jewess—Founding Mother ofAlchemy” (1982), 181.91. Abraham, A Dictionary of Alchemical Imagery (2001), 5.92. It is tempting to draw a parallel between the three phases of alchemyand the three phases of Van Gennep’s Rites de Passage:Nigredo corresponds tothe first phase in which the candidate is separated from his or her previousstate;Albedo to the marginal or liminal state; and finally, Rubedo to the aggrega-tion phase, or the incorporation of the candidate into the new phase.93.Collectanea Vol. 6, Part 3 (1957), 218.94. Abraham, A Dictionary of Alchemical Imagery (2001), 68.95. The Prima Materia presupposes a monistic theor y of metals, in whichall substances are believed to be basically one. The Greek alchemist Chymes iscited by Zosimus as having declared: “One is the All, and it is through it that theAll is born. One is the All, and if the All does not contain all, the All will not beborn.” Patai, “Maria the Jewess—Founding Mother of Alchemy” (1982), 182.96.

Occultism is defined as a “Current which also corresponds to No-tions.” “[Occultism] refers to the current which has appeared by the middle ofthe ninteenth centur y (notably under the influence of Éliphas Lévi), indirectly inthe wake of the philosophia occulta, and which has remained ver y much alive upto the beginning of the 20th centur y. It is characterized by the attempt to rec-oncile modern science and gnosis, by drawing upon the occidental as well asoriental traditions of the past.” Faivre, “Questions of Terminology proper to theStudy of Esoteric Currents in Modern and Contemporar y Europe” (1998), 8. Seealso Hanegraaff, New Age Religion and Western Culture (1998), 421–442.2. “Correspondences” is one of the constitutive elements of Westernesotericism, while “the Praxis of the Concordance” is one of the two “relative”elements.

The English-speaking readers first came in contact with Lévi’s writ-ings primarily through the extensive quotations from his works in Blavatsky’sIsis Unveiled (1877) and through Waite’s The Mysteries of Magic: A Digest of theWritings of Éliphas Lévi (1886). Translations of Lévi’s works include The Para-doxes of the Highest Science (1883); Transcendental Magic (1896), and The Historyof Magic (1913), the latter two translated by Waite; and The Key to the Mysteries(1913) translated by Aleister Crowley.7.

Others are more modest in their claims for an early beginning.

Quoted by King, Ritual Magic in England (1970), 119. Research is stillwanting on the subject of Western esotericism and sex. It is, however, clearthat the O.T.O. was not alone in combining magic with sex. For instance, thenineteenth-centur y American Rosicrucian Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–1875)advocated a form of sexual magic. See Randolph, Sexual Magic (1988); Deveney,Paschal Beverly Randolph (1997). Another early protagonist of sexual magic wasIda Craddock (1857–1902). See Craddock, “Heavenly Bridegrooms” and “Psy-chic Wedlock” in Motta, (ed.) The Equinox Vol. V, No. 4 (1981).

The A\\A\\ was founded by Crowley and George Cecil Jones (1873–1953) in 1907. It is often assumed that the letters stand for the Latin phrase of SilverStar, Argentinum Astrum. However, according to Eshelman the name is Astron Argon(\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007 \u0002\u0005\b\u0006\u0007), and it is alleged to be recorded twice in Crowley’s handwrit-ing. Another variant that Eshelman discusses is Aster Argos (\u0002\u0003\u0004\t\u0005 \u0002\u0005\b\u0006\u0003),which is supposed to derive from one of Crowley’s disciples—Charles StansfeldJones.

Gardner appears to have been positive toward Freemasonr y as late as1960. “[Gardner] has always had a ver y soft spot for the Craft [i.e., Freema-sonr y], and nowadays feels that there are close similarities in the craft of theWitches; in fact he goes so far as to say that Witchcraft is the original lodge.”Bracelin,Gerald Gardner: Witch (1999), 33.52.

And only a second- or third-degree witch may conduct aninitiation. There is, however, a special exception to each of these rules. The firstexception is that a woman may initiate her daughter, or a man his son[.] Theother exception concerns the only time when a first-degree witch [. . .] mayinitiate another. Wicca lays great emphasis on male-female working partner-ships, and most covens are delighted when a suitable couple come for ward forinitiation together.” Farrar, The Witches’ Way (1986), 11.56.

The four powers areScire, Velle, Audere, and Tacere, or To Know, To Will, To Dare, and To KeepSilent. Eliphas Lévi wrote: “To attain to Sanctum Regnum, in other words, theknowledge and power of the magi, there are four indispensable conditions—anintelligence illuminated by study, an intrepidity which nothing can check, a willwhich cannot be broken, and a prudence which nothing can corrupt and noth-ing intoxicate.

These twomay be either the man (already third degree) initiating the woman; or the woman(again, already third degree) initiating the man; or the man and woman mayboth be second degree, taking their third degree initiation together under thesuper vision of the High Priestess and/or High Priest.” Farrar, The Witches’ Way(1986), 33.207Notes to Chapter Seven"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"83.

This does not mean, however, that a symbol can be interpreted in anyway possible. As Snoek has stated: “In true symbolism, the beholder is by nomeans free to interpret the symbols which are offered to him, on the basis offree association. On the contrar y. Each symbol has a limited number of clear cutmeanings, even though it is often difficult to describe them in words. Also, notalways is ever y meaning a symbol has applicable. Which meaning or meaningsare applicable, depends on both the context and the persons involved.” Snoek,“The Allusive Method” (1999), 50.Appendix1 This list was presented by J.A.M.
