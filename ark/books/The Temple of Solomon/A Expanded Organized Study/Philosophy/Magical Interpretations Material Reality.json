This volume sets out recent thinkingon witchcraft in Africa, paying particular attention to variations in meaningsand practices. It examines the way different people in different contexts aremaking sense of what witchcraft is and what it might mean.Clearly, the promises of countless western social theorists – that such ‘enchant-ments’ would die a sudden death with ‘modernity’ – have not come to pass. Infact, despite growing democracy and development throughout the region, thegeneral sentiment on the continent is that witchcraft is increasing. Indeed,witchcraft is routinely implicated in modern state politics, free markets and legalsystems. But why, and why now?Using recent ethnographic materials from across the continent, the volumeexplores how witchcraft articulates with particular modern settings, for example:the State in Cameroon; Pentecostalism in Malawi; the university system inNigeria and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Ghana, Sierra Leoneand Tanzania. The editors provide a timely overview and reconsideration oflong-standing anthropological debates about ‘African witchcraft’, whilesimultaneously raising broader concerns about the theories of the western socialsciences.

Winston Churchill was reported as indignantthat so much time and money had been spent on ‘all this obsolete tomfoolery’.Helen Duncan was a well-known psychic and such conjurers of ectoplasm andconversers with the dead were more normally prosecuted under the 1824Vagrancy Act, providing a concrete link between the practices of spiritualismand the poverty and distress that provided its fertile ground. Spiritualismflourished in the context of other occult beliefs. The First World War of1914–1918 had dealt death arbitrarily and on a massive scale. It had disruptedthe flow of generations and the form of family life, and was speedily followed byfurther economic disaster. The popular followers of Helen Duncan were facinghardship and social transformation in equal and large measure, and somehowthe limits of this world were all too apparent. Yet perhaps surprisingly,spiritualism was not a manifestation of ‘tradition’ or a hangover from the past,but a new quest for meaning in the context of rapid industrialization, large-scalewar and the major advances of Victorian and early twentieth-century science.The Society for Psychical Research was founded in 1882 by a group of eminentVictorians. Seances, then popular, were occasions when sleights of hands,trickery and fraud were all in play, but the audience, for all their credulity, werealways asked to see and hear for themselves; not only to experience strangeevents, but to witness their proof. Ghost hunters and other sceptics set aboutproving the opposite, but science and spiritualism – far from being simpleopposites – were conjoined investigators.Spiritualism in its Victorian and early twentieth-century form died out assomething of mass popular interest from the 1950s onwards: a period of notableeconomic growth and social confidence in the United Kingdom. Today, however,at the dawn of a new millennium, newspapers advertise weekend ‘PsychicFayres’ where gullible audiences listen to tarot card readings and the voices ofthe dead. In the intervening years, popular belief in flying saucers, New AgeSpiritualism, millennial cults, Gaia, crop circles and aliens has waxed andwaned, but never died out. Nor have compulsory education and an increase inChapter 1Magical interpretations and material realitiesAn introduction1Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"the popular understanding of science done much to dent the popularity ofscience fiction or indeed to prevent perfectly sane individuals from claimingthat we are all descended from lizards. Science and the occult have never beenentirely separate. Not then. Not now. It is enough to recall – evolutionarytheory is one such case – that serious sciences have often started off as forms ofimaginative ‘metaphysics’.Around the turn of the nineteenth century, anthropologists and otherwesterners frequently (mis)took ‘witchcraft’ in Africa and elsewhere for evidenceof ‘primitive’ or ‘pre-logical’ thinking (Lévy-Bruhl 1926); for somethingEuropeans themselves had, in times past, endured, but had now outgrown.African witchcraft thus served as an unmistakable marker of ‘the primitiveother’. This idea, popular in its day, meshed neatly with European socialevolutionary thinking – underpinned as it was by those grand, Enlightenment-inspired notions of progress, development and modernization (Frazer 1959[1890]; Tylor 1913 [1871]). Social evolutionary theory, like all theories, made anumber of assumptions. Principle among them was that all societies have an in-built telos, allowing or even causing them to ‘evolve’ along a linear pathfrom ‘primitive’ to ‘modern’. This movement logically implied an eventualconvergence of societies everywhere, and that this was a ‘natural’ process.As societies ‘evolved’, a number of things allegedly happened: scientificunderstandings grew; instrumental rationality increased; a secular world viewtriumphed; ‘superstitions’ like witchcraft vanished; and people made an ever-clearer distinction between facts and fictions, objective Truth and subjectivefalsehoods. Social evolutionary theory suggested that Europeans had somehow‘evolved’ quite a bit further than had Africans or other ‘primitives’. Such evolutionary notions of course sprang directly from eighteenth-centuryEuropean Enlightenment thinking, and also underpin the works of later,foundational social theorists: Marx’s inevitable move from precapitalist socialformations through to communism; Durkeim’s transition from mechanical todifferentiated, organic forms of social cohesion; Weber’s modern capitalism inwhich ‘religious and ethical reflections upon the world were increasinglyrationalized . . . [and] primitive and magical notions were eliminated’ (Gerthand Mills 1958: 275). Yet it should not surprise us that education and science, the two most potentsymbols and purveyors of progress and modernity, should not eradicate belief inthe unseen, in the magical, in powers that transcend ordinary human controland comprehension. Since the 1980s, there has been an upsurge of popular andacademic interest in ‘witchcraft’ in Africa – as it has been generally termed – inoccult powers, ritual murders, the commoditization of body parts, and the role ofGod and the Devil as opposing forces in the world. This volume sets out recentwork on such phenomena, and pays particular attention to variations inmeanings and practices, and to the way different people in different contexts aremaking sense of what ‘witchcraft’ is and what it might mean. Key questionsinclude whether ‘witchcraft’ is appropriate as a catch-all, general term, why2 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"incidences of witchcraft accusation, witch-finding, and occult practices might beon the increase, and how these discourses and experiences can be explainedin relation to socio-economic transformation, growing inequalities and theperception of modernity and globalization by local actors. One thing that is very clear is that the African experience may have caughtthe imagination of anthropologists, politicians and journalists, as well as localadministrators, business people, civil servants and ordinary citizens in Africaand elsewhere, but it is not unique. Africans have no monopoly on witchcraft,occult forces and discourses (cf. Brown 1997; Comaroff 1994; Greenwood 2000;Melley 2000; Morris 2000; Stewart and Harding 1999; Scheper-Hughes 2000).Moreover, contemporary witchcraft, occult practices, magics and enchantmentsare neither a return to ‘traditional’ practices nor a sign of backwardness or lackof progress; they are instead thoroughly modern manifestations of uncertainties,moral disquiet and unequal rewards and aspirations in the contemporarymoment (Comaroff and Comaroff 1999). The very familiarity of such practicesbegs questions that are difficult to answer, principle among them: ‘What do wemean by the terms we use’?What is witchcraft?What is clear from contemporary work on Africa is that the term ‘witchcraft’has been generally used to cover a variety of activities, often of the nefarioussort, and that in much of the literature it is used almost interchangeably withterms like the occult, magic and enchantment. Anthropologists have justifiedthis more capacious and shapeless use of the term with reference to thewidespread local use of the term in Africa and, in particular, in print andelectronic media on the continent and elsewhere. Geschiere (1997: 13–15)makes this very valid point, and argues that as social scientists we cannot affordto distance ourselves from complex, on-the-ground realities. While this isundoubtedly true, difficulties remain.For one thing, there is the question of what exactly witchcraft is. Earlieranthropological work dedicated a certain amount of ink to trying to distinguishbetween witchcraft and sorcery: where the former was a mystical and innatepower, and the latter was an evil magic consciously practised against others,sometimes deploying objects, ‘medicines’ or ‘tools’ (Middleton and Winter1963; Harwood 1970). Problems of translation immediately raise questions,since the usual French translation of the English term ‘witchcraft’ inanthropological texts is sorcellerie. Such distinctions have on the whole inanthropology been disregarded in favour of a more contextualized approach. Inmany earlier texts, then, witchcraft refers to local beliefs about good, evil,causation, divination and healing that provided ‘a coherent ideology for dailyliving’ (Fortes 1953: 18; Evans-Pritchard 1937; Gluckman 1944). This is in itselfa very broad definition, and clearly accounts for the easy extension of theterm ‘witchcraft’ to cover such things as zombies, ritual murder, sale andIntroduction 3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"manipulation of body parts, general occult powers and magic. It also drawsattention to Crick’s point that the term ‘witchcraft’ is an historical one: itsmeanings, deriving from a particular period and culture, cannot be meaningfullytransferred to another (Crick 1970: 343). Crick’s view is that witchcraft beliefsare inextricably tied up with moral systems, ‘evaluatory ideas’ and ‘systems ofbelief ’ and have to be understood in context (ibid.: 347). While all the authors in this volume contextualize ‘witchcraft’ in this way,situating it soundly within particular ethnographic and historical settings,several also make the point that witchcraft is perhaps best understood as amatter of social diagnostics rather than belief. This is because, for many peoplein Africa, witchcraft is not so much a ‘belief ’ about the world as it is a patentfeature of it, a force that is both self-evident and solemnly real – a point FrancisNyamnjoh (Chapter 2) makes clear in his discussion of the popular epistemo-logical order of Cameroon and beyond: ‘an order that marries the so-callednatural and supernatural, rational and irrational, objective and subjective,scientific and superstitious, visible and invisible, real and unreal’ (see p. 29). Inthe contexts of Nigeria, Malawi and South Africa, the respective chapters ofMisty Bastian, Rijk van Dijk and Adam Ashforth (Chapters 4, 5 and 10) allmake a similar point by showing how witchcraft pervades and saturates anumber of separate yet interrelated social and cultural domains. Across thecontinent, people see witchcraft less as extraordinary than as everyday andordinary (Ashforth 1996), forming as it does an integral part of their daily lives.Recent commentators have observed that local terms associated withwitchcraft, magic and power have very specific meanings, not all of themassociated with harmful activities. Thus, rather than translating local terms as‘witchcraft’ or ‘sorcery’, which often conjure only negative images and associa-tions in the western mind, it may be sensible to use ‘a more neutral term like“occult forces”; this leaves open the question of whether the force is used for evilor for good’ (Geschiere 1997: 14). Bongmba (1998: 168), for instance, discusseshow the Wimbum people of Northwest Cameroon employ three different termsfor the phenomenon glossed as witchcraft to refer to ‘an overarching conceptionof local knowledge, power and interpretation of misfortune’, and there are bothpositive and negative uses of such knowledge and power. Particularly attuned tothe problem of translation, Susan Rasmussen (Chapter 7) similarly shows thatthe Tuareg of Niger have four distinct notions of occult forces – both negativeand positive – which defy simple English glosses and understandings (alsoRasmussen 1998). One of the points being made here is that seeing contem-porary witchcraft and occult practices in Africa through the prism of a particularEuropean historical experience runs the risk of serious misapprehension (Crick1979), and overemphasizes negative power and malevolent forces at the expenseof local understandings based on ambiguity, where understandings changecontextually: ‘the same techniques may be moral and approved in one contextbut immoral and outlawed in another’ (Krige 1947: 12; see also Nyamnjoh,Chapter 2; Sanders, Chapter 8; Ashforth, Chapter 10; Fisiy and Geschiere,4 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter 11).2Indeed, many scholars have noted that local African terms arenot direct translations of the English term ‘witchcraft’; and that local termsfrequently run the gamut from ‘good’ to ‘bad’ mystical forces. Godfrey Wilsonnoted in 1936 for the Nyakyusa that they had one word, ovolosi, meaningaggressive witchcraft that was bad, and another, amanga, meaning defensivewitchcraft that was good, as well as a phrase ‘the breath of men’ which meantthe power of witchcraft used in accordance with general public opinion (Wilson1936: 85). Oyler noted for the Shilluk that they believed in the management ofoccult powers by both good and evil medicine men (Oyler 1920). The majorargument here is that power and its operation in and across everyday and occultrealms is ambivalent, and people’s views of its workings and consequences areambiguous (Arens and Karp 1989; Geschiere 1997; Rowlands and Warnier1988: 121; Sanders 1999; West 1997; 2001).As Africanist anthropologists have increasingly problematized the relation-ship between ‘mystical’ and ‘mundane’ forms of powers, exposing in particularethnographic settings the subtle and ambivalent operation of occult forces anddiscourses (Ellis 1993; Ellis and ter Haar 1998; Feierman 1990; Murphy 1998;Packard 1981; Sanders 1998; Strandsbjerg 2000), they have simultaneouslydrawn attention to how witchcraft is sometimes seen as something more thanjust good or bad forces. For example, Rijk van Dijk (Chapter 5) shows howPentacostalists in Malawi often understand witchcraft as being about humouror irony, which thus carries connotations of scepticism. Such views offer acompelling critique of Horton’s (1970) notion that witchcraft is a ‘closed’system, incapable of engaging meaningfully with people’s social worlds. Aboveall else, the point of interest is that speaking of ‘witchcraft’ in general terms,and conflating it with European historical experience, reconfigures it assomething ‘backward’, anti-scientific and/or ‘traditional’, and imposes a specificview of the relationship between modernity and witchcraft that obscures thenature of such practices and beliefs in the contemporary moment (Pels 1998;Olivier de Sardan 1992). The question of translation is however much more complex. Since Africansthemselves use both the English and French terms for ‘witchcraft’, ‘sorcery’ andsorcellerieand have done since colonial times – that is, for the last one hundredyears or more – the meanings of these terms have evolved; they have not stayedstatic. In addition, processes of urbanization and migration have meant that localpeople have adopted indigenous terms from neighbouring groups or from thosewhose languages have become the lingua franca or national language of differentcountries. There is therefore no easy discussion about the simple translation ofindigenous terms into English or French. A further and important point has beenthe influence of Christianity on witchcraft belief, and the deployment of dualisticthinking surrounding the powers of God and the Devil (e.g. Niehaus et al. 2001:ch. 2). This has proved particularly relevant for an understanding of the rise ofPentecostal and other charismatic churches in Africa (van Dijk, Chapter 5;Meyer 1999; MacGaffey 1983).

Built ona solid foundation of earlier explorations (Evans-Pritchard 1928, 1929, 1931,1932a, 1932b, 1933, 1934, 1935), this tome was the first major treatise on Africanwitchcraft which would fire the anthropological imagination on a number ofissues, and which has served as an anthropological benchmark to this day. In an implicit argument with Lévy-Bruhl (1926), who adamantly argued thatAfricans were mired in a mystical, ‘prelogical’ mentality, Evans-Pritchardclaimed that Azande thinking was no less rational than European thinking.Azande witchcraft, rather, was a highly coherent and engaged system ofmeanings – an African epistemology – that made logical sense once oneunderstood the basic premises upon which it was based. Evans-Pritchard thustook a ‘cultural’ or ‘symbolic’ approach to witchcraft, in that his principalconcern was with the sociology of knowledge and systems of thought. So why did the Azande believe in witchcraft? His answer: because it explainedthe inexplicable. Witchcraft offered explanations for misfortunes, explanationsthat addressed the ‘why’ more than the ‘how’ questions. Thus, to recall oneparticularly well-known example, when free-standing granaries occasionallycollapsed and killed those sitting under them, the Azande knew as well asEuropeans that termites had eaten and thus weakened the legs, thus occasioningthe unfortunate event. This answered the howquestion. But Azande witchcraftprobed somewhat deeper, asking questions like: whyhad that particular personbeen sitting under the granary when it collapsed, and whyhad it collapsed atthat particular moment? In some ways, then, Azande witchcraft dealt with theBig Questions in life – which were, at once, ontological and cosmological innature – questions that called for answers of quite a different order to the narrowanswers ‘science’ could provide.In making this argument, Evans-Pritchard did at least two things. First,he demonstrated the rationality of witchcraft, suggesting it could not be takenas a marker of muddled, mystical thinking. The Azande were every bit asrational as their European counterparts; their respective mental make-upsand reasoning abilities were no different. This had the effect, second, of callinginto question grand evolutionary teleologies which suggested that Africanswere somehow inferior, mentally or otherwise, to Europeans. If the purportedlyprelogical was perfectly logical after all, then any supposed evolutionary movefrom the former to the latter was utter nonsense. Following Evans-Pritchard,an entire generation of anthropologists aimed to demonstrate, in varied6 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ethnographic locales, that ‘witchcraft is something more than meaninglesssuperstition’ (Krige 1947: 8).Later generations of anthropologists would similarly seek to ‘make sense’ ofAfrican witchcraft. And their answers, though frequently different to Evans-Pritchard’s answer, would similarly subvert – sometimes implicitly, sometimesexplicitly – European notions of unilinear progress.Witchcraft, Oracles and Magicwas published in the late 1930s, but it was notuntil the after the Second World War, in the 1950s and 1960s, that the topicof African witchcraft once again received sustained analytic attention. One ofthe most concerted efforts came from the Manchester School – Max Gluckman(1956: ch. 4), Victor Turner (1957), Clyde Mitchell (1956), Max Marwick(1965) and the like – who had their own ways of ‘making sense’ of Africanwitchcraft. Unlike the general thrust of Evans-Pritchard’s writings, theManchester approach highlighted the social rather than the metaphysical sensein witchcraft. By using the extended case study approach and by focusing on patterns ofwitchcraft accusations, Manchester anthropologists sought to demonstrate howwitchcraft led to fissions and, less often, fusions in a range of ‘traditional’African societies. Here, ‘witchcraft accusations were an idiom in which thepainful process of fission could be set going’ (Douglas 1970: xviii). Witchcraftaccusations were analysed as a ‘social strain-gauge’ (Marwick 1964), linked tosocial control and change. The general view was that witchcraft accusationstended to occur in situations where social relations were ill-defined or abrasive.The initial impetus for such work had come from Evans-Pritchard’s work on theAzande where he had suggested that witchcraft accusations appeared whereother mechanisms for resolving tensions between neighbours failed. TheManchester School’s concern was thus less with why Africans believed inwitchcraft than with the effects that such beliefs had on local social structures.Witchcraft may have been philosophically meaningful, but it was alsomeaningful because it didthings: it led to the formation of new villages andlineages, and to the ruin of old ones. Witchcraft made sense because it‘functioned’ (Middleton 1960, 1963; Mitchell 1956; Turner 1957). Underpinning this view was the idea that witchcraft accusations weregenerally made against specific individuals and by those who were involved inspecific networks of social relationships with them. Hence witchcraft andkinship became indissolubly linked in the anthropological imagination: amongthe Azande (Evans-Pritchard 1937); Pondo (Hunter 1936); Lovedu (Krige andKrige 1943); Amba (Winter 1965 [1959]); Cewa (Marwick 1952a, 1952b,1965); Gusii (Mayer 1954); Ndembu (Turner 1957); Lugbara (Middleton 1960,1963); Kaguru (Beidelman 1963); Suku (Kopytoff 1964); Yao (Mitchell 1956),Tonga (van Velson 1964). This despite the occasional report that witchcraftaccusations were never made between kinsfolk or only between certaincategories of kinsfolk under certain conditions (Wilson 1936; Lienhardt 1951:312). A related argument was made with regard to gender relations, and patternsIntroduction 7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"of witchcraft accusation were traced to forms of descent reckoning, the positionof wives, and the practice of uxorilocal marriage in matrilineal societies (Turner1957; Colson 1958; Nadel 1952; Mitchell 1956; Gluckman 1956; Mayer 1954;Middleton 1960). These views have retained their hold on anthropologists to asignificant extent, even though the structural-functional framework withinwhich they were first expressed is no longer popular: ‘As long as the familyremains the main basis of social security, the enigmatic discourse on witches andtheir secret forces will continue to mark people’s reactions to modern changes inAfrica’ (Geschiere 1997: 214).While in some respects structural-functionalist approaches failed to do justiceto the complexity and subtleties of Evans-Pritchard’s work, and Evans-Pritchardhimself deplored the crude functionalism of many interpretations of witchcraft(Douglas 1970), they did make useful advances in certain areas. Arguably themost important was the sustained focus on social change – a topic that, some-what ironically, recent scholars have vehemently charged structural-functionalismwith ignoring. Witchcraft accusations and the social tensions and fissions theygenerated, quite literally, made history. However, the emphasis on the normativeand moral aspects in the context of mechanisms to maintain the stability ofsociety resulted in an emphasis on homeostasis: witchcraft was a pressure value,a means for relieving tensions so that change would not occur. The result was astrangely ambivalent relation to the general question of social change.In such a system, witchcraft was itself controlled. However, this led structural-functionalist accounts to explain situations in which witchcraft accusation orwitch-finding appeared to be increasing as ones in which social stability was itselfbreaking down. Hence, structural functionalist authors routinely linked apparentincreases in witchcraft to the negative effects of colonialism, wage labour,migration, Christianity and urbanization. Audrey Richards was often explicit onthis point: ‘native belief in witchcraft, and the widespread use of protective magicand counter-charms of all kinds . . . I believe to have been actually increased bycontact with white civilization, and the resultant economic and social changes inNorthern Rhodesia’ (Richards 1935: 460).Witch-cleansing or finding movements were a notable feature of colonialAfrica, and were generally interpreted as being the result of new institutions andmodern forms of socio-economic breakdown: ‘Missionaries all over Africa areteaching a religion which casts out fear, but economic and social changes have soshattered tribal institutions and moral codes that the result of white contact is inmany cases an actual increase in the dread of witchcraft, and therefore in thewhole incidence of magic throughout the group’ (Richards 1935: 458). The ideathat ‘the west’ or ‘modernity’ has occasioned outbreaks of witch-cleansing cultsand occult beliefs has remained popular (e.g. Auslander 1993), and throughoutthe decades, such outbreaks have often been billed as ‘modern’, since they oftenincorporate new styles and symbols of state institutions and translocal economicprocesses into older rituals and regimes of value (Richards 1935; Marwick 1958;Auslander 1993; but see Green 1997). Evans-Pritchard recorded the witch-8 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"finding and witchcraft-related movements that were sweeping the Belgian Congoand the Sudan in the 1930s, and that were both invoking the symbols and valuesof the colonial state and simultaneously subverting state authority (Evans-Pritchard 1937: 511ff.; cf. Fields 1985; van Binsbergen 1981).The rise of sorcery, witchcraft and the occult was frequently linked to:colonial meddling in traditional authority structures; increased travel andcommerce (Wilson 1936: 94); the prevalence of venereal disease, especially incertain mining districts; the jealousies surrounding new forms of production(Field 1940: 141); the increased social insecurity and social differentiationevident in African townships (Aquina 1968); and social change in general:Thus it appears that in Ashanti ten years ago increased European contact,an extension of social scale, rapid economic advance, political change, andthe spread of Christianity and school education had been accompanied notsimply by the persistence of witchcraft beliefs but by their very considerableincrease, and by the emergence of new cults designed to deal with them. (Ward 1956: 47)In short, witches in Africa and their possibly increasing influence/incidencehave long been associated with new forms of consumption, production andpolitical control: ‘Wherever modern changes have brought about situations forwhich there are no indigenous precedents, and problems of tribal rules of thumbcan offer no solution, these tensions arise and are often expressed in terms ofwitchcraft’ (Marwick 1958: 112).The structural-functionalist writers of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as theirpredecessors, have thus turned out to have much in common with contemporarywriters on witchcraft who also explain both the nature and the prevalence ofwitchcraft on changed relations of power, production and consumption. Yet theevidence from the period 1930–1970 was by no means clear cut, and as Douglaspointed out: ‘The general proposition that an increase of witchcraft accusationsoccurs as a symptom of disorder and moral collapse was superbly untestable’(Douglas 1970: xx). There was no baseline data that would allow scholars todecide whether witchcraft was really on the rise, and the very fact of accusationand cleansing movements could be taken as an indication of moral resistance tosocio-economic change rather than as a symptom of breakdown and disruptionin traditional society. Many contemporary accounts of witchcraft suffer fromthese problems also, but what is noticeable is that although the way anthro-pologists have supported their claims about rising occult practices and beliefshas varied considerably, the reasons given for those increases have beenremarkably uniform. ‘Research from every part of Africa reports that there is afeeling that bad magic – i.e. sorcery rather than witchcraft – is on the increase.We can relate this feeling directly to the increase in opportunities for advance-ment and promotion’ (Brain 1982: 382). The impact of increasing socialdifferentiation brought on by modernity (Rowlands and Warnier 1988; Drucker-Introduction 9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Brown 1993) and ‘the troublesome articulation of local means of productionwith more distant (often international) sources of power and value’ (Comaroff1997: 10) have provided the background for interpretation. The view that witchcraft is on the increase has been with us since at least the1940s: ‘The present state of things is that, as far as we can assess the matterourselves, bolokiis not decreasing its hold on the people’s minds, rather thereverse’ (Viccars 1949: 228). It is, of course, demonstrably easier to documentthe fluctuations of certain occult-related activities than others. Witch-cleansingand witch-finding movements, for instance, are highly public spectacles thathave come and gone at particular historical moments (cf. Auslander 1993;Douglas 1999; Green 1997; Richards 1935; Ward 1956; Willis 1968). Anotherway anthropologists have attempted to establish that witchcraft is rising is bynoting its increased prevalence in public rumours and gossip, or in the popularmedia (Bastian 1993: 155–156; Geschiere 1997). The question of whetherwitchcraft and resort to occult forces is on the increase in contemporary Africais difficult to answer definitively. Yet what isclear is that many people acrossAfrica – indeed across the globe – are experiencing what they believe to be anupsurge in witchcraft and occult activity. Occult beliefs and practices, in theComaroffs’ words, ‘are widely experiencedthroughout the world as intensifying ata frightening rate at present’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 2000: 316, emphasis inoriginal; forthcoming).Witchcraft and modernityMore recently, beginning in the late 1980s (Geschiere 1988; Rowlands andWarnier 1988; Warnier 1988; Fisiy and Rowlands 1989), and given furtherimpetus in the early 1990s (Comaroff and Comaroff 1993b), the study of‘African witchcraft’ has experienced a decisive revival. And it has come withsome new theoretical, methodological and topical twists. As ever, these innova-tions have come side-by-side with anthropology’s ongoing concern to ‘makesense’ of witchcraft. In the process anthropologists have also sought – morevocally than ever before – to unsettle the western teleologies of social change. One of the main contentions of recent work is that because the powers ofwitchcraft are ambivalent, they can easily reinvent themselves in novelsituations: ‘It is precisely through this ambivalence that discourses on the occultincorporate modern changes so easily’ (Geschiere 1997: 13). Consequently,witchcraft is dynamic and engaged with the world and is, for this reason,eminently modern (Auslander 1993; Comaroff and Comaroff 1993a; Bastian1993; Geschiere 1988; Shaw 1997b). ‘The modernity of witchcraft’ (Geschiere1997) is often presented as a critique of earlier theorists who, like Lévy-Bruhl,saw witchcraft as primitive and prelogical or, as earlier anthropologists so oftenseemed to imply, as a static and tightly-bounded tradition. Related to this is theclaim that previous scholars misunderstood witchcraft by failing to look beyondsmall-scale, village-level communities (Geschiere 1997: 12). Finally, given10 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"witchcraft’s inherent dynamism, and its everlasting engagement with themodern moment, recent scholarship has highlighted the historicity of witchcraftdiscourses and practices – suggesting that they are forever changing, alive to thebasic rhythms of our world over the longue durée(Shaw 1997b; Green 1997;Colson 2000; cf. Ardener 1970). In this volume, this latter point is arguedforcefully by Rosalind Shaw (Chapter 3), and by Cyprian Fisiy and PeterGeschiere (Chapter 11). Shaw shows how local images of cannibalism andoccult forces in Sierra Leone are both historically-informed and modern, andhow these images have continually (re)produced themselves through ongoing,translocal transactions over many centuries. Similarly concerned with historicalprocess, Fisiy and Geschiere problematize the relationship between witchcraftand development in Cameroon from the 1960s to the present, showing howlocal understandings of witchcraft have shifted historically from ‘levelling’ to‘accumulation’. At different times, in different places, and in different ways, theoccult and modernity have gone hand-in-hand.The claims recent scholars have been making about witchcraft – that it is‘modern’ not ‘traditional’; wide-ranging not ‘local’; historical not static – are allvery important. But it is also worth noting that these claims are not altogethernovel, even if they are sometimes presented as though they were. As we saw inthe previous section, earlier anthropologists were concerned with witchcraft asa response to social change, and writings on witch-cleansing movements inmany ways anticipated recent developments by focusing on the region-widespread and movement of witchcraft. Moreover, while it may be true that manyearlier works were village-focused, others also focused on occult beliefs andpractices in urban settings, or at rural–urban interstices (Hellman 1935: 59–60;Mayer and Mayer 1961: ch. 9; Mitchell 1965; Hammond-Tooke 1970; Swartz1970; Gamble 1973/74). In fact, some recent studies have themselves beencriticized for taking as their starting and ending points ‘the village and itslimited microcosmos’ (van Dijk 1995: 172). Overall, then, it appears that witchcraft, for many anthropologists, has longbeen part engaged with modernity, if not exactly a part of it (Richards 1935).Anthropologists have long known that witchcraft does not whither under‘modernity’: in fact, as they have frequently noted, witchcraft and other occultbeliefs and practices are often mustered to ‘resist’ changes and are creativelyrefashioned to suit new situations. For this reason it would be wrong to suggest,as plenty of social theorists have, that ‘[m]odernity destroys tradition’ (Giddens1994: 91); or that modernity leads to secularization (Voyé 1999).Even so, recent works on witchcraft are notsimply repeating what has alreadybeen said. For today’s problematique differs markedly in some respects, and hasprovided additional theoretical purchase over our previous understandings ofwitchcraft. Where recent scholars of witchcraft part company from their pre-decessors is not in their insistence on social change, or even on the notion thatwitchcraft is a response to social change, but in their insistence that witchcraftoperates as part and parcel of modernity itself. In other words, contemporaryIntroduction 11"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"scholars of witchcraft cast occult beliefs and practices as not only contiguouswith, but constitutive of modernity. One recent development that signals a definitive shift in contemporaryapproaches to witchcraft is the notion of modernity that is deployed. In stressingthat witchcraft is modern, it has also been common to note that modernities aremultiple (Comaroff and Comaroff 1993a), and that witchcraft and occult beliefsand practices articulate differently with different trajectories of modernity. AsBastian (Chapter 4) asks in her discussion of the cosmological contours ofNigerian modernity, ‘Can people’s experiences of being modern ever behomogenous, when their histories, societies and basic cosmological under-standings are not the same?’ This question has been raised increasingly – andnot just by anthropologists studying witchcraft – with the explicit aim ofundermining teleologies.3This it does in several ways. For one, it makes plainthe lack of convergence across the globe: modernity does not conform to asingle plan or follow a single trajectory. For while it is undoubtedly true that‘[m]odernity is everywhere’ (Gaonkar 1999: 1) and is ‘at large’ (Appadurai1996), our world has not become one, and it seems unlikely that it ever will.This is one reason why, following recent poststructuralist concerns withpluralities, fragmentation and anti-telos, a number of scholars have suggestedthe notion of ‘multiple modernities’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 1993a; Fischer1999: 459; Taylor 1999: 162–165).Modernity comes with no single built-in telos, no single rationalizing raisond’être: modernity, if it ever was a single entity, has gone in innumerable andoften unanticipated directions. To assume multiple modernities is to assume theworld is best seen ‘as a story of continual constitution and reconstitution of amultiplicity of cultural programs’ (Eisenstadt 2000: 2). As such, the notion ofmultiple modernities is a firm refutation of 1950s and 1960s modernizationtheories as well as dependency theories, all of which assume societal andeventually global convergence. It explodes the mythology about globalizationwhich wrongly suggests the world, with modernity, will become one. Morehelpful still, the notion of multiple modernities refocuses social theory onquestions of heterogeneities, differences, structural and other inequalities andcompeting discourses about power (Escobar 1995; Ferguson 1994, 1999). Thishas usefully allowed for the continued study of ‘globalization’, and the very realstructural inequalities generated therein, without the presupposition that theworld is becoming one. Since modernity has not led to the wholesale convergence of societies andcultures, it is plain that there is nothing particularly ‘natural’ or inevitable aboutit. Modernity is not simply the logical outcome of an inevitable unfoldingof structures and ideas. Rather, modernity turns out to have been cultural allalong. The notion of multiple modernities, then, is useful ‘to remind ourselvesthat our pretended rationalist discourse is pronounced in a particular culturaldialect – that “we are one of the others”’ (Sahlins 1993: 12). It allows us toproblematize modernity: to see it as a deeply cultural project, to treat its claims12 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"to rationality not as natural, universal truths but as particular discourses abouttruth that require explanation.4Seeing modernity(ies) as a cultural project has allowed anthropologistsconcerned with witchcraft to refocus our discipline’s analytic gaze back onourselves, and draw parallels between the operation of ‘occult economies’(Comaroff and Comaroff 1999) the world over. In the process, it has also freedup a valuable conceptual space for self-critique. The focus has shifted to certaindynamics of power, to how hidden forces shape everyday worlds in specificcultural forms. Juxtaposing the west and the rest – considering witchcraft andconspiracy theories (West and Sanders n.d.), child abuse and satanic rites (LaFontaine 1992, 1998; Comaroff 1997), spirit possession in Asia (Geschiere1998a), and American spin-doctors (Geschiere 1998b) as kindred beliefs aboutthe world’s workings – is important because it shows that ‘witchcraft’, and theparticular dynamic of power it presupposes, are not just African phenomena.They operate in similar fashion the world over, albeit in different modernitiesand different culturally-inflected guises. Also, by rendering such beliefs andprocesses parallel, many recent scholars have suggested that ‘occult economies’critique the varied modernities of which they form a part. The crucial point isthat this particular project has allowed anthropologists to do what we have longexcelled at: to render familiar the unfamiliar ‘other’, while standing our ordinarywestern world on its head.Important though this agenda undoubtedly is, the notion of ‘occult econo-mies’ is not without its difficulties. For one thing, as Sally Falk Moore (1999)has suggested, the comparative notion of ‘the occult’ is very broad. This raisesthe questions, On what basis can we compare and analyse such disparate eventsand phenomena under a single heading? The second difficulty is whether suchapproaches are prone to overstate the relationship between the occult andmodernity. After all, being within modernity and being about modernity arenot logically the same (Englund 1996: 259; Sanders n.d.). Is witchcraft, or theoccult more generally, offering a critique of globalization and modernity? Mustit do so (van Dijk, Chapter 5)? Is witchcraft really about symbolic politics (cf.Auslander 1993; Green 1997; Englund 1996)? Could it be that anthropologistsare telling a popular liberal tale through ‘others’ and, in the process,inadvertently reinscribing the very ‘us’–‘them’ dichotomies we seek todismantle? It seems most unlikely that, in all cases and places, people areresisting or critiquing the technologies and conveniences of modernization,and they are certainly not shy of the capitalist relations needed to acquirethem. Instead, what many are after ‘is the indigenization of modernity, theirown cultural space in the global scheme of things’ (Sahlins 1999: 410). In theend, we need to pay close attention to witchcraft in specific social andhistorical settings rather than assume monolithic meanings. In rightly dis-missing one of modernity’s central master narratives – that of unilinear progress– we should not be duped into uncritically accepting another (Englund andLeach 2000).Introduction 13"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and globalizationIn recent studies of witchcraft, the broadening of scope in historic terms hasbeen matched by a broadening of scope in geographical terms, a decisive shiftingin the scale of study. As already noted, recent studies criticize structural-functionalists for restricting their analyses to village-level events, and forimplying that witchcraft is the sole product of specific, bounded cultures like‘the Azande’ (Geschiere 1988: 39–40, 1997: 12). This is an attack, above all, onthe level of analysis, suggesting that previous generations either did not look farenough to answer the questions they raised, or that their questions were toonarrowly framed from the start. It seriously calls into question earlier claims that‘witchcraft beliefs are likely to flourish in small enclosed groups, wheremovement in and out is restricted, when interaction is unavoidably close, andwhere roles are undefined or so defined that they are impossible to perform’(Douglas 1982 [1970]: 108). From the contemporary perspective, witchcraftforms part of a much broader ethnographic context; it is shaped, or evenproduced by, translocal ‘others’ and images, connected as it is to a vastly-expanded universe of values and meanings. Practically, this idea has led analyststo do ‘ethnography on an awkward scale’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 1999: 282),to range freely from one level of analysis to another, from local-level politics torural-urban linkages to the nation-state and the global system (Geschiere andMeyer 1998; Geschiere and Nyamnjoh 1998; Parish 2000). These expandedanalytic horizons have led, in turn, to an increased concern to problematizelocal–global interstices (Shaw, Chapter 3; Weiss 1998). In this expanded universe of value, some have argued, witchcraft can be seenas indigenously-inflected critiques of modernity(ies), capitalism and globalization,and the inherently problematic relations of production that accompany them(Comaroff 1997: 10, 1994: 11; Parish 2000: 488; Auslander 1993: 189; Meyer1992: 118, also 1995). Thus, witchcraft is not only implicated in and mouldedby the global system; it goes further, according to some analysts, and provides ametacommentary on the ill-doings of capitalism and globalization. But is today’s world really so different from previous times? Has there been anidentifiable rupture, a definitive sociohistorical break with the past? On the onehand, there doesseem to be something categorically different about today’sworld – with its rapid flows of people, goods and ideas around the globe(Appadurai 1996; Hannerz 1996: 19; Tambiah 2000: 164). On the other, at thesame time, there are undeniable historical continuities in our world (Mintz1998), and we should be extremely careful not to overplay the contrasts betweenpast and present, then and now, static and active, bounded and unbounded,since to do so threatens to reassert the very dichotomies anthropologists haveworked so hard to call into question (Piot 1999: 22). One of the centralpreoccupations of social theorists has been how to make sense of today’s world ofpluralities – multiple modernities, ever-expanding cultural flows and the ever-present tensions between forces of homogeneity and heterogeneity. Witchcraft14 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"is related here, argue recent theorists, since it is often the product of suchtranslocal flows of information, people and goods (Comaroff and Comaroff1999, 2000; Masquelier 1999, 2000; Shaw 1997b; Scheper-Hughes 2000).Illicit accumulationA large body of evidence from Africa suggests that witchcraft and other occultpractices are intimately bound up with people’s ideas about production,exchange and consumption. The flows of information, goods and peoplecharacteristic of globalization are seen as incorporating some and excludingothers: the processes of differentiation and privation that result are viewed aspredatory and illicit forms of exchange. The terms of exchange equate peopleand their body parts with commodities, their life-force with ill-gotten wealthand their fertility with immoral consumption (Nyamnjoh, Chapter 2; Bastian,Chapter 4; Sanders, Chapter 8; Comaroff and Comaroff 1999; Scheper-Hughes1996, 2000).5Stories of zombies, cannibalism and headhunting are imaginative,moral frameworks for making sense of wage labour, consumption, migration,productive regimes, structural adjustment programmes, development policiesand the functioning of markets (Shaw, Chapter 3; Shaw 1997b; Comaroff andComaroff forthcoming; Masquelier 2000; Niehaus 1995: 537). Such frameworksdo not exist in isolation. There are other forms of discourses and types ofexplanation that provide understandings of how these processes work, wherethey are going, their value structures and their impact on people. These include,of course, the discourses on economic growth, development, globalization, theknowledge society, civil society and democratic participation (many of whichare informed by teleological notions of ‘natural’ progress). Such discourses arethemselves part of the globalized world they seek to describe, and whilst theymay have originated in particular academic, institutional and entrepreneurialsettings, they are also to a greater or lesser extent part of local discoursesavailable on the radio (Radio Trottoir, for example), in newspapers, in rumoursand through participation in development projects, structural adjustmentinitiatives, credit schemes, schools and hospitals (Sanders, Chapter 8; Fisiy andGeschiere, Chapter 11).For instance, Adeline Masquelier (2000) shows how stories of cannibalismand headhunting are part of Nigerien peasants’ experience of migrancy,smuggling and marketing, and are connected to their understandings of howcapitalism, globalization and international relations (with Nigeria) work.Masquelier argues that these economies of terror and violence, where kinsfolktrade their relatives to Nigerian cannibals who consume their life-force in orderto get rich, are linked to people’s ideas about improper accumulation and illicitwealth: to the production of wealth through mysterious means and apparentlywithout normal forms of labour (Masquelier 2000: 91). The Nigerien economyis subordinate to that of the wealthy Nigeria, but Nigerien peasants are under noillusion that theirs is a world of tradition and morality, while that of Nigeria is aIntroduction 15"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"land of modern and despicable ogres. The rural communities of Niger recognizethat there are Nigeriens who are just as involved in the production of illicitwealth, who suffer from a hunger, an insatiable desire to consume. The threat topersonal and social integrity is that people may turn into uncontrolledconsumers, or worse still, consumable commodities. The rumours of cannibalismare thus a moral mediation on the effects of global markets on local economies:‘For the victims as well as the beneficiaries of the large abstraction we choose tocall capitalism . . . the experience itself arrives in quite personal, concretelocalized, mediated forms’ (Scott 1985: 125).In such stories of cannibalism, capture, headhunting and trading in humans,links are made between occult forces and production and consumption. Thestories and accounts themselves are forms of historical consciousness or socialmemory (Shaw, Chapter 3 and 1997a, 1997b), ways of making sense ofexperiences and ideas that are current in specific places at specific times. A keyfeature here is the idea that people often experience modernity as a lack, assomething from which they are ‘abjected’ (Ferguson 1999), or that others haveaccess to via nefarious means. Thus, for instance, Sanders (Chapter 8) showsthat many Tanzanians have experienced their recent involvement in ‘the freemarket’ with great ambivalence since some have greatly enriched themselves,while the vast majority have instead been excluded from novel forms of wealth.This has led to increased speculation – in idioms of occult-related trafficking inhuman skins – about new relations of production, accumulation and consumption,and people’s differential access to these processes through occult means. Such views are not simply a misrecognition of capitalism or the workingsof the economy, but metaphysical speculations about the origins of value.Consider Birgit Meyer’s (Meyer 1998a) work on Pentecostalism in Ghana. Sherelates the amazing spread of Pentecostal Churches in Africa to, among otherthings, their ability to provide people with the solution to their ambivalenceabout new consumer goods. Pentecostalism takes people’s fears seriously andlinks particular global commodities to the work of the Devil. It also providesa ritual to purify them, so that such commodities may be consumed withoutdanger (Meyer 1998a). Indeed, Meyer claims that one of the reasons for theextraordinary popularity of the Pentecostal Church is its claim to be able toreveal the occult forces behind money, power and goods. Pentecostalism becamepopular in Ghana just after the Rawlings ‘revolution’ when the state completelyfailed to deliver services and goods to people. The Pentecostal emphasis onsuccess and wealth, but through Godly means, later helped to make sense of thefact that even with structural adjustment and the availability of western goods,life for ordinary Ghanaians remained one of hardship (Meyer 1998b). Thedualistic theology of Pentecostalism emphasizes the struggle between God andthe Devil, and witchcraft and other occult practices are explicitly recognized asthe Devil’s work. In this context, modern Christianity has not displaced ideasabout witchcraft and the occult, but provided a new context in which theymake perfect sense (see van Dijk, Chapter 5).16 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Jane Parish’s chapter (Chapter 6) raises yet another set of concerns about thelinkages between occult and globalizing forces, and draws our attention, onceagain, to the above-mentioned issues of translation/meaning and theambivalence of occult powers. In the context of Ghana, Parish shows how, onthe one hand, ‘young marketeers’ see anti-witchcraft shrines as legitimate formsof occult powers and use them to gain access to new forms of wealth, while onthe other, ‘young aristocrats’ see (some of) these shrines as models of ‘a trueAfrican past’ that should not be exploited for personal gain in the present.Furthermore, the young aristocrats denounce many of these shrines as fulfilling‘the white man’s worst prejudices about witchcraft’. Thus, while all concernedactively engage with local understandings of ‘tradition’, ‘modernity’, ‘power’ and‘witchcraft’, they simultaneously draw global, master narratives on unilinearprogress into their discussions and debates. Adam Ashforth (Chapter 10) raises similar issues in his discussion of ‘spiritualinsecurity’ in Soweto, South Africa. There, people experience a multifacetedsense of danger, doubt and fear about witchcraft, and are faced with anoverabundance of local and global interpretive authorities, few of whom agree onthe nature of occult forces, and how best to manage them (see also Ashforth1998a). Understanding such conditions of chronic uncertainty – by no meansunique to South Africa – further elucidates, for instance, why HIV/AIDS inAfrica is often interpreted across multiple registers and from competingepistemological perspectives, witchcraft being one of them (Yamba 1997;Ashforth 2001).Illicit powerWitchcraft and related occult activities have often been thought of as outside thelaw, both in Europe and in Africa. However, contemporary witchcraft and anti-witchcraft practices in Africa need to be understood in terms of state power, actualpolitical processes, and local political institutions (see Nyamnjoh, Chapter 2;Bastian, Chapter 4; Niehaus, Chapter 9; Fisiy and Geschiere, Chapter 11; Green1997). Anti-witchcraft practitioners, as noted above, often claim to be workingwith God and/or Christian Saints. They may also claim to be working fordevelopment and for the state by combating the reactionary and backward, not tosay baleful, nature of witchcraft and its work against modernity (Green 1994: 32,1997). Such claims depend not just on local understandings of modernity anddevelopment, but also on local perceptions and knowledge of political processes,and the relationship between local-level politics and the state. It is no surprise tofind witchcraft and anti-witchcraft practices bound up with ideas about powersince witchcraft and other occult practices are themselves about hidden forces inthe world, as well as part of a more general discourse on morality, sociality andhumanity. Geschiere (1988: 37) has argued that in many African contexts sorceryand witchcraft play a central role in the tensions between state and society, andthat this is particularly relevant as forms of the modern state are themselves boundIntroduction 17"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"up with new forms of power and wealth. In many contexts, the oppressive natureof the state, combined with corruption and the continuing impoverishment oflocal populations raises questions about how wealth is produced through theexercise of illegitimate or illicit power. The effects of structural adjustment anddevelopment projects are seen in many cases as further examples of therelationship between wealth and illicit power under the patronage of the stateand/or local political appointees. Rowlands and Warnier (1988) demonstratedhow crucial sorcery is to modern politics in Cameroon and that the link betweenforms of power and forms of domination – a link that earlier anthropologists wereable to demonstrate as working through witchcraft – is at the heart of both localpolitical processes and state building in the contemporary period (also Ellis 1993;Ellis and ter Haar 1998; West 1997, 2001).Writers on the relationship between witchcraft and occult activities and thestate tend to take one of two positions. Popular beliefs about witchcraft are seenas a form of political action from below, where witchcraft accusations are used aslevelling mechanisms preventing social inequalities from developing beyond thepoint of community control. However, because witchcraft and the occult areambiguous and ambivalent forms of power, they can also be deployed to protectthe accumulation of power (Geschiere 1997) – hence the mass of contemporaryevidence from Africa that local populations, in both rural and urban contexts,see political leaders and elites as involved in the nefarious deployment of occultpowers to gain and maintain political power (see Nyamnjoh, Chapter 2; Bastian,Chapter 4; Fisiy and Geschiere, Chapter 11). State power is itself associatedwith witchcraft and occult power, and the evident desire of many African statesto link economic and political control to cultural domination is clear from,amongst other things, the involvement of the media in the political manage-ment of popular sentiment and comprehension (see Nyamnjoh, Chapter 2).However, the link between state power and occult forces has been reinforcedin the popular imagination – starting in colonial times and continuing to thepresent day (Orde Browne 1935: 485; Bukurura 1994: 65; Ciekawy 1998; Gray2000; Melland 1935: 496; Roberts 1935: 488–489) – by the state’s attempt tooutlaw witchcraft, often resulting in the law taking action against those whoaccused and perhaps punished or killed witches, rather than against the witchesthemselves: ‘Many Africans view these measures [outlawing the killing ofwitches] as indications that modern state apparatuses have aligned themselveson the side of evil because from their standpoint these measures have obviouslybeen designed to protect witches and sorcerers against retaliation by theirinnocent victims’ (Middleton and Winter 1963: 21; also Winter 1963: 286; cf.Abrahams 1994: 18–19). The perception that the state is in league with witchesand the occult is today reinforced not just by rumour and reporting in themedia, but by the ambivalent relation of the modern state to ‘culture’, ‘belief ’and ‘tradition’. As Isak Niehaus compellingly argues (Chapter 9), the SouthAfrican state reinforced this ambivalence first through the Ralushai Commissioninquiry into witchcraft and second through an evident desire to take witchcraft18 Henrietta L. Moore and Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"beliefs seriously, whilst punishing attacks on apparently innocent individuals (cf.Fisiy and Geschiere, Chapter 11; Ashforth 1998b: 531). Thus while somepostcolonial states have revamped or removed colonial witchcraft legislation,this has often reinscribed rather than eroded conceptual linkages people makebetween the occult and the state. Fisiy and Geschiere (1990) note that althoughstate courts in the Cameroon have regularly convicted witches since the end ofthe 1970s, the courts work with local ‘witchdoctors’, and it is through theircollaboration that witches are brought to court and convicted (also Fisiy andRowlands 1989; Geschiere and Fisiy 1994; Fisiy 1998). Witchcraft and theoccult are thus not just about popular ways to resist the state. They areconstitutive of state power and legal process.ConclusionWhy have beliefs in the occult and occult-related practices not died out? Howcan such things remain in our modern and modernizing world? The authors inthis volume demonstrate that these questions, though frequently asked, arefundamentally misframed. For we can only think such ‘enchantments’ shouldwhither and die if we think in narrow teleological terms of progress, developmentand modernization. However, once we admit to ‘multiple modernities’, to theidea that ‘progress’, ‘development’ and ‘modernity’ are multiplex, undecidableand contextually specific, there is no reason to suppose that the occult shouldvanish. Such a question would seem no more or less pressing than one that askswhy any other feature of our contemporary global landscape might wax or wane.We might equally pose the question: when will western faith in grandteleologies of progress vanish, given there is a world – quite literally – ofevidence that they lack explanatory value? Should it not concern us thatwestern teleological models bare no obvious resemblance to our multiply-modern empirical world? And are western teleological beliefs about progress,development, rationality and modernity – those ready-made explanations forsocial change that provide answers to the Big Questions in life – really sodifferent from the idea that occult forces move the world? What, after all, is thedriving force behind ‘progress’ or ‘development’? Could it be ‘the market’ andAdam Smith’s invisible hand, or some other similarly enigmatic notion? When,in short, will our own occult beliefs about the motor of our contemporary worldbe given up? As anthropologists have long known, there is nothing particularly natural orobjective or amoral about social change – or, for that matter, about markets,currencies, commodities and their workings. Rather, all are deeply embedded insocial, cultural and political processes and institutions (Appadurai 1986;Comaroff and Comaroff 1993a; Parry and Bloch 1989; Ferguson 1995; Geschiere1992). Indeed, as often as not, claims to ‘naturalness’ serve more to justify thanto explain (Butler 1990; Ferguson 1994; Sanders 1998; Williams 1999;Yanagisako and Delaney 1995). Introduction 19"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the occult in Africa are a set of discourses on morality,sociality and humanity: on human frailty. Far from being a set of irrationalbeliefs, they are a form of historical consciousness, a sort of social diagnostics. Inthis sense, they strongly resemble other forms of social, economic and politicaldiagnostics, originating in the academy and without, that try to explain why theworld is the way it is, why it is changing and moving in a particular manner atthe moment. These theories, most of them originating in the social sciences, areequally concerned with value and growth, with consumption and power, andwith the impact of the world on the lives of individuals and communities: inshort, with the major concerns of witchcraft.Notes1 We would like to thank the ESRC for funding which has made this volume possible.2 See Keesing 1985 for a general discussion of problems of translation in anthropology.3 On varied notions of ‘African modernity’ see Moore 1996 and Piot 1999. Moregenerally, see the special issues of Dædalus (2000, vol. 129, no. 1) and Public Culture(1999, vol. 11, no. 1) on ‘multiple modernities’ and ‘alter/native modernities’respectively. See also the interesting work by Mayfair Yang (2000) that deals withthe question of ‘multiple capitalisms’.4 A number of scholars have viewed capitalism in this way: ‘Western capitalism in itstotality is a truly exotic cultural scheme, as bizarre as any other, marked by thesubsumption of material rationality in a vast order of symbolic relationships’ (Sahlins1993: 12; also Sahlins 1976; Mintz 1985; Comaroff and Comaroff 2000). 5 See Sharp 2000 for an excellent overview of the commodification of the body and itsparts.

This dominant epistemologicalexport has not always been sensitive to new perspectives that question conven-tional wisdom and myopic assumptions. It has largely remained faithful to a typeof social science induced and informed more by fantasies, prejudices, stereotypes,ideologies and biases about Africa and Africans. Given its remarkable ability toreproduce and market itself globally, this epistemological export has emptiedacademia of the power and impact of competing systems of knowledgeby Africans (Mudimbe 1988: x–xi). Yet, only by re-integrating sidelinedepistemologies can African studies graduate from scholarship by analogy toscholarship informed by African worldviews and historical processes (Mamdani1996: 12–13).Under the dominant epistemological import from the west, most accounts ofAfrican cultures and experiences have been generated from the insensitiveposition of power and quest for convergence and homogeneity. Explicit orimplicit in these accounts is the assumption that African societies shouldreproduce western ideals and institutions regardless of the feasibility orcontextual differences. Few researchers of Africa have seriously questioned thetheories, concepts and basic assumptions that inform the dominantepistemological import. The tendency has been to conform to a worldconceived in the image of the west without the rest (cf. Abdel-Malek 1967:250–264; Chinweizu 1987). The looks they have generally brought to bear onthe continent and its realities have been mainly condescending, and havetended to devalue or reject many social experiences Africans value.

Often missing areperspectives of the silent majorities deprived of the opportunity to tell their ownstory their own way or even to enrich others’ defective accounts with their ownlife experiences. Correcting this entails paying more attention to the popularepistemology on which ordinary people draw daily, and the ways they situatethemselves in relationship to others within that epistemology.To understand the importance of witchcraft and its relationship to develop-ment or the lack thereof in Cameroon, we must understand the popularepistemological order to which Cameroonians subscribe. Under the dominantwestern export, reality is presented as anything whose existence has, or can be,established in a rational, objective manner. According to this export, the worldis dichotomous: there is the real and the unreal. The real is the rational, thenatural, and the scientific; the unreal is the irrational, the supernatural and thesubjective. Such a dichotomy has also been used to categorize whole societies,countries and regions, depending on how these ‘others’ were perceived inrelation to western Cartesian rationalism and empiricism. The popular epistemological order in Cameroon and most of Africa does notsubscribe to the same dichotomies. On the contrary, it builds bridges between ormarries the so-called natural and supernatural, rational and irrational, objectiveand subjective, scientific and superstitious, visible and invisible, real and unreal;making it impossible for anything to be one without also being the other. It is anepistemological order where the sense of sight and physical evidencehave notassumed the same centrality, dominance or dictatorship evident in the westernexport’s ‘hierarchies of perceptual faculties’ (van Dijk and Pels 1996: 248–251).It has equal space for all the senses, just as it does for the visible and theinvisible. The real is not only what is observable or what makes cognitive sense;it is also the invisible, the emotional, the sentimental (Redfield 1997). In thisepistemology emphasis is on the whole, and truth is something consensual, notthe result of artificial disqualification, dismemberment or atomization.In this popular system of knowledge, the opposite or complement of presenceis not necessarily absence, but invisibility. Thus, as Mbembe (1997) argues,understanding the visible is hardly complete without investigating the invisible.We misunderstand the world if we ‘consider the obverse and the reverse of theworld as two opposite sides, with the former partaking of a “being there” (realpresence) and the latter as “being elsewhere” or a “non-being” (irremediableabsence) or, worse, of the order of unreality’. The obverse and its reverse are alsolinked by similarities which do not make them mere copies of each other,but which unite and at the same time distinguish themselves according tothe Cameroonian or African ‘principle of simultaneous multiplicities’ (Mbembe1997: 152). In other words, far from merely being the other side, the maskor substitute of the visible, the invisible is in the visible, and vice versa, ‘not as amatter of artifice, but as one and the sameand as external reality simultaneously –or as the image of the thing and the imagined thing at the same time’ (Mbembe1997: 152).Development and witchcraft in Cameroon 29"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Following this ‘principle of simultaneous multiplicities’, we can understandwhy, for example, few conflicts make sense without understanding the role ofsupernatural powers and those witches, diviners and (oc)cult members whowield them. A person who wishes to harm or influence another throughwitchcraft or other occult means need not bother with the victim’s physicalabsence when something of his or hers (hair, cloth or whatever) can serve as asubstitute. One may be visible and physically present, at the same time thatone’s spirit has temporarily left the body to hunt for game in the likeness of apredator, to commit mischief, or to wreak havoc on others and their property.This speaks not only of the multi-dimensionality of life, but also of the fact thatall of life’s dimensions can be articulated simultaneously at various levels, visibleand invisible.Writing about Togo and Liberia, Ellis (1993, 1999: 220–280) argues that apowerful person is one who can convince others he or she controls a complexarray of visible and invisible forces. For ‘just as a person known to have politicalpower is presumed also to have power over the spirit world, so a person whosuccessfully manipulates the symbols of spiritual control is assumed also to be inpossession of political power’ (Ellis 1993: 471). In a context where wealth,prestige and power are in limited supply and intensely sought after, one must beingenious in one’s quest for these things. And ‘acquiring the strength of othersthrough eating their vital organs or drinking their blood’ after ritual killings,could be a sure technique for acquiring or maintaining all three (Ellis 1999:265). Appearances can indeed be deceptive.This popular epistemological order is also at variance with the tendencyin the western export to minimize the power of society, social structures,communal and cultural solidarities by ‘trumpeting instead the uncompromisingautonomy of the individual, rights-bearing, physically discrete, monied, market-driven, materially inviolate human subject’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 1999a: 3).It refuses to see individuals and social structures as passive and easily detachablefrom one another, to be manipulated into compliance with the expectations ofthose who know best. It stresses instead a mix between individual rights andinterests on the one hand, and the rights and interests of groups and collec-tivities, on the other. In discussions of development in Africa, the narrow insistence on individualrights, freedoms and aspirations even among academics has impaired under-standing of the interconnectedness of peoples, cultures and societies refusing tosee individuals as products, melting-pots and creative manipulators or jugglers of‘multiple identities’ (Werbner 1996). Imported western discourses on develop-ment and democracy tend to recognize individuals and nation-states as real, buteither ignore the existence of intermediate communities, or treat these asbacksliding on the long march towards modernity. Discussing agency anddevelopment in Africa demands careful scrutiny of individual and collectivecultural identities. Indigenous African ideas of freedom need to feed into thecurrent sterility of the dominant western epistemological export on the30 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"continent. It is traditionally African to see and treat the individual as a child ofthe community, as someone allowed to pursue his or her needs, but not greed.The individual’s creativity, abilities and powers must be harnessed, in order to beacknowledged and provided for. Agency has meaning only as domesticatedagency, by which is meant agency that stresses negotiation, interconnectednessand harmony between individual interests and group expectations. In otherwords, with domesticated agency, the freedom to pursue individual or groupgoals exists within a socially predetermined framework that emphasizesconviviality with collective interests while simultaneously allowing for individualcreativity and self-fulfilment. Social visibility or notability derives from beinginterconnected with others in a communion of interests. Given life’s vicissitudes,it pays to be modest about personal success, and measured in one’s ambitions.Through domesticated agency, the collectivity shares the responsibility ofsuccess and the consequences of failure with the active and creative individual,thereby easing the pressure on individuals to prove themselves in a world ofever-diminishing opportunities. Domesticated agency does not deny individualsthe freedom to associate or to be self-reliant or independent, but rather puts apremium on interdependence as insurance against the risk of dependence,where people face the impermanence of independent success. Achievementis devoid of meaning if not pursued within, as part of, and on behalf of a groupof people who recognize that achievement. For only by making their successescollective can individuals make their failures a collective concern as well. Suchdomestication emphasizes negotiation, concession and conviviality over maxi-mization of pursuits by individuals or by particular groups in contexts of pluralityand diversity. Appreciation should be reserved and room created for excellence,especially for individuals who demonstrate how well they are ready to engagewith collective interests. Individuals who refuse to work towards enhancing theircommunity are those most likely to be denied the public space to articulate theirpersonal desires. And faced with the vicissitudes, temporality or transience of personal successin the context of African modernity, even the most achieving and cosmopolitanor diasporic of individuals hesitates to sever links with kin entirely. They striveinstead to make their village community part of their successes and goodfortunes in the world beyond, so that, in return, the community will help themin times of individual failure and misfortune. The city and the ‘world out there’are perceived as hunting grounds; the home village the place to return to at theend of the day. Investing in one’s home village is generally seen as the bestinsurance policy, and a sign of ultimate success, for it guarantees survival evenwhen one has lost everything in the city, and secures and manifests success insatisfying obligations (Nyamnjoh 2000). Thus, although successful urbanitesmay not permanently return to or retire in their home villages, most remain inconstant contact with them, and some wish to be buried or re-buried there(Geschiere and Nyamnjoh 2000). Even those who have no ties with village kinand are permanently trapped in urban spaces often reproduce the village andDevelopment and witchcraft in Cameroon 31"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"localist styles in subtle and imaginative ways. No one, it seems, is too cosmo-politan to be local as well.Witchcraft and the occult in CameroonAfrican epistemology has important implications for the study of witchcraft andhow it relates to development. Scholars inspired by the dominant westernepistemological import have tended to be dichotomous in their approaches towitchcraft. When not simply dismissed as superstitious beliefs and practices byprimitives, witchcraft has tended to be confined to rural or village communitieswhere individuals are still supposedly trapped by custom and tradition. Theexpectation has been that once de-contaminated, disinfected, exorcized orenlightened by science through education and urbanization, the village Africanshould abandon, as a matter of course, his or her penchant for witchcraft beliefsand practices, accusations or counter-accusations, just as Europeans are presumedto have done. The city or town has tended to be excluded, a priori, from studiesof witchcraft; city dwellers have either been assumed to be rational, civilizedand scientific in their outlook and behaviour, or the victims of witches andwizards from their backward-looking home villages. Often tantalized by suchassumptions, cosmopolitan Africans have found themselves pretending tobe Cartesian rationalists in public or declaration, and epistemologicallyautochthonous and/or indigenous in private or practice (Nyamnjoh 1991). However, witchcraft and the occult have no sacred spaces. They are aspractised in urban spaces as in rural ones, as much by the most cosmopolitan as bythe most localist. They may assume new forms and new uses (Geschiere 1997),but witchcraft and occult practices form part of everyday life in urban Africa (e.g.Ashforth 1996, Chapter 10; Bastian, Chapter 4; van Dijk, Chapter 5). Even acasual perusal of newspapers makes plain that the urban elite, those who publishand read these papers, are obsessed with witchcraft and the occult, especially inthe context of globalized consumerism (cf. Comaroff and Comaroff 1999b,1999c). In contemporary Africa, development is presented as the way to salvation,promising concrete and visible results; but the more it is pursued, the greater anillusion it becomes. High expectations are not matched by positive results, anddisappointment grows by leaps and bounds. Development or modernity seems toexcel in churning out ‘malcontents’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 1993) throughunilinearity and zombification. A world where development is promised tomany, but where only a few reap the rewards, is bound to baffle and disappoint.It is also bound to intensify questioning of Cartesian rationalism as a solution.And even if the elite leadership cannot afford to pursue this questioning openlyand aggressively for fear of turning off the tap of development assistance, thentheir private lives continue to bridge the artificial chasms between science andwitchcraft, and between the individual and community. Faced with repeateddetours and derailments on the way to the Calvary of Development or32 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Modernity, the African elite have opted for the more realistic and reassuringalternative of straddling the visible and invisible worlds which the popularepistemology has always treated as complementary parts of reality, the pursuit ofwhich any inclusive science ought to make its mission.In this light, we can understand the widespread belief in and resilience ofsorcery or occult forces in Cameroon not so much in terms of the inability ofCameroonians to modernize their beliefs and rituals, but as reflecting collectivepreoccupations with the conflictual relationships between competing agentiveforces in societies where promises of development are fast becoming brokendreams for all but an elite few (cf. Ferguson 1999). Sorcery can be as much asource and resource of personal and collective power or powerlessness as it is a callfor domesticated agency against various forms of exploitation, marginalization,inequality and individualism (Ardener 1996: 243–260; Rowlands and Warnier1988: 121–125; Warnier 1993a: 139–162; Geschiere 1997; Fisiy and Geschiere1996: 193–197; Geschiere and Nyamnjoh 1998). Indeed, the fact that sorceryaccusations usually occur between family members or kin is indicative of howmuch ordinary Cameroonians cherish the solidarity of domesticated agency andhow ready they are to protect it from aggression and the harmful pursuit ofpersonal success (see Geschiere 1995: 7–35; Fisiy and Geschiere 1996: 197;Geschiere and Nyamnjoh 1998). For what use is a social system that glorifiespersonal success but in reality has little space for all who seek it? Successattainable only at the expense of others’ humanity is not considered worthpursuing.Witchcraft and politics in urban Cameroon:animality and powerLet us look at some allegations of mystical connections in urban Cameroon, theveracity of which has generally been accepted. In 1994, following a double slashin civil servants’ salaries and a 50 per cent devaluation of the Franc CFA,rumours of mystical occurrences connected with sex and sexuality were common-place – quite understandable in a country where phallocracyhas become adominant mode of power, and where men use wealth and office to debase andextract maximal libidinal pleasure from women (cf. Mbembe 1992, 1997). InLimbe, rumours suggested that Igbo businessmen from Nigeria were makinglocal men’s sexual organs shrink or disappear, simply by shaking hands withthem. Limbe women were rumoured food for Nigerian business tycoons’ penises.These stories were, and are, widely reported and widely believed. Around thesame time, it was rumoured that two girls from the University of Yaounde fellvictim to a foreign tycoon. Stories claimed the girls dated the man, and laterreturned to his posh residence in the Bastos area. Rather than sleeping with thegirls, the foreigner chose one, and allegedly transformed himself into a boaconstrictor and began to swallow her. When the other girl realized what washappening, she hastily departed and alerted the police. The police investigationDevelopment and witchcraft in Cameroon 33"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"supposedly revealed that this was common practice for this man. This storycirculated widely in the press, on Radio Trottoirand by word of mouth, andwas generally believed. Today, thousands of such stories about mystical boaconstrictors circulate around the country. Professor Gervais Mendo Ze, General Manager of Cameroon Radio Television(CRTV) since the early 1990s, has masterminded most of the manipulation thathas kept President Biya recycling and perfecting the insensitivities ofillegitimate power. He has also been at the centre of numerous rumoursconnecting him with straddling religions – being both a committed Catholicwho propounds the virtues of the Virgin Mary (mariologie) on the one hand, anda Rosicrucian whose mystical totem is a boa constrictor that sucks the blood ofyoung virgins whom he entices with money and expensive gifts of necklaces(serpentologie) on the other. Rumour has it he drinks his victims’ menstrualblood. On 15 February 1999, a girl known simply as ‘cousine Elise’ phoned theYaounde FM94 A Coeur Ouvertpresenter Joly Nnib Ngom, to accuse ‘a wellplaced personality of the Republic’ whom she had dated for six to seven monthsof having given her a boa constrictor in the form of an expensive goldnecklace.1Rumour immediately associated Mendo Ze with the girl, and mattersworsened when Mendo Ze suspended the programme’s presenter. The rumourwas given extensive coverage in the private press and was widely disseminatedin public places. Although the presenter was eventually reinstated, the rumourremained, and Mendo Ze has since been given the nickname of serpentologue, togo with mariologue. The reputation he had gained as Deacon and expert on theVirgin Mary was subsequently dented when Christians protested against hisalleged occult practices with mysterious snakes, and the Catholic authoritiesbanned him from giving communion.In Yaounde on Christmas day 1999, four children went missing. Three dayslater, they were found dead in an abandoned car with their genitals cut off.2Rumours started that Professor Mendo Ze had hired someone to carry out theritual killing, since he allegedly trafficked in human body parts (Sanders, Chapter8). A few months later, Magistrate Louis Ndzie was savagely murdered inYaounde. Purportedly he was the one handling the murdered children’s file, andhe had vowed to catch Mendo Ze for his diabolical acts. Having failed to influ-ence the magistrate through his wife (with whom Mendo Ze was said to have hadan affair) and with a bribe of several million Francs CFA, Mendo Ze reportedlyasked the wife to hire thugs to eliminate her magistrate husband. Shocked,Yaounde magistrates threatened a strike action, which was only averted by ahurried countrywide reshuffle of magistrates, ordered by President Biya. The latemagistrate’s wife was reportedly detained at the Kondengui Central Prison inYaounde.Why is there the tendency to believe these stories without proof? To thosewho subscribe to the popular epistemology where reality consists of the visibleand the invisible, these stories make perfect sense. Since the early 1990s,President Biya, with the assistance of Mendo Ze and others, has thwarted34 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"popular aspirations for democracy. The elite have stood their ground against theCameroonian majority, remaining insensitive to calls for change. Even whenbeaten in the polls they have remained obstinate. This is not natural, andcannot be explained simply in terms of Cartesian rationalism. How can ahandful of people defy the will of the majority of Cameroonians? There must besome unseen forces, a face behind the mask, that imbues them with power andconfidence beyond the ordinary; power and confidence that have succeeded,quite strangely, in hypnotizing masses of angry, hungry and disaffectedCameroonians during a more than ten-year clamour for democracy.As recently as July 2000, Professor Gervais Mendo Ze boasted that hisCRTVjournalists were Les Lions Indomptables de l’audio-visuel. At the 1992 presidentialelections, Paul Biya presented himself as l’homme Lion, imbued with the power,courage and intentions of protecting Cameroon from les marchands d’illusions;the main opposition leader John Fru Ndi and his Social Democratic Front(SDF) were presented as champions by CRTV. In taxis, market places, bars,chicken-parlours and elsewhere, ordinary people saw Biya’s message as acorruption of reality. He was a lion, no doubt. But his mission was not to savebut to devastate, for five more years, Cameroon and her people. This alternativeinterpretation never made its way to national radio and television, not eventhrough the other presidential candidates, whose campaign broadcasts wereheavily monitored and censored. Jean-Jacque Ekindi, for example, a 1992presidential candidate, who had baptized himself the foremost chasseur du Lion(lion hunter), had his trenchant campaign counter-offensives banned by CRTV.Crowning CRTV the ‘Indomitable Lion’ of the broadcast media while thegovernment was pretending to be liberalizing broadcasting, was a timelyreminder to the information-hungry public not to take the government’srhetoric on liberalization too seriously. Cameroon, in short, had space for onlythree Indomitable Lions: President Biya, the CRTV, and the national footballteam, whose victories and fame the President and CRTV were simulatingthrough manipulation and corruption.3The tendency to believe in a hidden hand is akin to an indictment of liberaldemocracy and its illusions of empowerment and development. Liberal demo-cracy and the version of development it inspires promise political, economic andcultural enrichment for all. But in reality a hidden hand (of capital, the west,etc.) determines who among the many shall be provided for. Its rhetoric ofopening up, and of abundance, is sharply contradicted by the reality of closuresand of want for most of its disciples. The hidden hand of global capital and itsconcerns, for example, through the IMF, World Bank and national interests ofWestern partners, make it possible for autocracy to pay lip-service to democracyand development in exchange for guaranteeing the political stability needed byinvestors to venture into the periphery. In exchange for having weak foreignrelations, autocratic regimes like Cameroon’s are afforded the ability andprotection to flex their muscles within their own countries, in a perplexing andmystical manner. Hence, instead of democracy and development for ordinaryDevelopment and witchcraft in Cameroon 35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"people who want such things, one finds myriad ways people’s rights and dignitiesare bargaining away. Cameroonians and Africans, who are well aware of thiscontradiction, realize that pursuing undomesticated agency is a very riskybusiness. There is an ever-looming possibility, even for the most successful andcosmopolitan, of the sudden unexplained failure, and of having to cope alone;hence, nearly everyone’s eagerness to maintain kin networks they can turn to intimes of need. Even those who have severed kin links entirely seek suchsolidarity in kin of another type: for some ruling elite, these alternativenetworks are provided by membership in mystical cults such as Rosicrucianismand Freemasonry. These alternative networks purport to offer them doubleprotection: against the harmful expectations of village kin; and against thevicissitudes or impermanence of success in the modern world. Hence whetherone is entirely localist or cosmopolitan, or both, witchcraft and the occult seemalways to provide solutions to otherwise insurmountable problems, both forthose modernity has by-passed and for those on whom it has smiled. The sort ofuncertainties and anxieties people feel in modern life simply cannot be attendedto by the imported pseudo-scientific doctrine of Cartesian rationalism andempiricism alone. This is obvious even to the most learned (in Cartesianrationalist and empiricist terms) and cosmopolitan.Examples of mystical happenings associated with the powerful are countless.One could easily write volumes just on allegations and rumour about the invisibleand political power in Cameroon. In February 1997 an oil-filled train derailed inYaounde. It was rumoured that the indigenes, the Ewondo (of the same ethnicorigin as President Biya and his closest collaborators), barred all non-indigenesfrom recovering for themselves any spilt oil. They reputedly claimed the oilbelonged to the autochthons alone. A disaster occurred when someone inadver-tently struck a match, and hundreds of people died. This, like other accidentsand deaths, was also linked to the ruling Cameroon People’s DemocraticMovement (CPDM) party and the President, whom it was alleged usually mademystical sacrifices of ordinary militants and supporters before a major politicalevent, which in this case was the imminent parliamentary elections scheduledfor May 1997. On previous occasions, the deaths of family members (e.g.Jeanne-Irene Biya) and close collaborators of President Biya (e.g. Motaze Roger,a presidential cook, Jean Assoumou and Jean Fochive), have been connectedwith rumour that they had been sacrificed to occult forces so that the Presidentcould survive difficult political spells. Political survival, according to suchrumours, is predicated upon human sacrifices to occult forces. In a contextwhere the vote has been rendered impotent by greed and ulterior motives,legitimacy has to be conferred by less visible mechanisms than formal elections.Cabinet reshuffles are always preceded by rumours of occult sacrifices, visits tofortune-tellers and witchcraft practices. Incumbents and aspirants are said toscheme for cabinet positions, and to employ natural and occult forces to thisend. Various lodges and fraternities allegedly play a major part in determiningwho stays and who becomes what. Among the key players are Rosicrucianism36 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"and Freemasonry, both of which are influenced and implanted from France, amajor and not-so-hidden hand in Cameroonian politics. It was even rumouredthat President Biya financed the construction of a Rosicrucian lodge in France,and that he moved his membership between lodges depending on his politicalfortunes.4He might be a Catholic and even an ex-seminarian whose family hasbeen personally blessed by Pope John Paul II on two consecutive visits toYaounde, but this does not stop him, nor apparently contradict his allegedlycultivating mystical identities to buttress his political power base.5If the reality of politics were limited to the apparent and the transparent asprescribed by liberal democracy, there would hardly be reason to explain successor failure otherwise. In general, if people had what they merited, and meritedwhat they had in liberal democratic terms, there would be little need for ahidden hand of any kind, real or imagined. But because nothing is what itseems, the invisible must be considered to paint a full picture of reality.Kinship, development and witchcraft in the Bamenda GrassfieldsThe following two cases offer insights into understandings of success anddevelopment in the Bamenda Grassfields of north-west Cameroon (cf. Rowlands1994, 1995). Again, this is an understanding informed by the popular episte-mology as discussed above and revisited below.Case oneMr X came from Guzang in the Northwest Province and lived in Mutengene,Southwest Province. He had close relatives (his brother’s children) in Ekona, afew miles from Mutengene. Until his brutal murder in July 1999, he was thelocal headman or chief of the Metah community in Mutengene, a position hehad earned for his long residence there, his good character and his reputationfor friendliness and charity. He was also considered rich, owning a largecompound, several houses and an off-licence bar. Mr X was a Presbyterian, andan active member in the Christian Men’s Fellowship (CMF); he reportedlyloaned them nine million Francs CFA for their uniforms. Though some thought Mr X became rich from his prolonged service as adriver with the now-defunct Marketing Board, his kin in Ekona claimed it wasbecause he had joined an occult group. This suspicion was strengthened by anaccount of a fellow Metah man who had paid a casual visit to his residence andfound a glittering cross on the door. This man was so terrified that he hadfortified himself by ingesting some earth (a practice thought to preventbewitchment) before drinking what his host had served. The following concerns the savage killing of Mr X by his relatives followingaccusations of witchcraft. The accusations attest not so much to the inexplic-ability of death, as to the sense that a person’s life is inextricably intertwinedwith kin. For it is in this context that a person achieves successes and failures,and where these ‘achievements’ are visible and invisibly noted. Development and witchcraft in Cameroon 37"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Several of Mr X’s kin in Ekona had died mysteriously, all allegedly from hiswitchcraft. The latest was a young man. Mr X was away in his native village,Guzang, at the time. This time, the kin in Ekona vowed not to bury the corpse,but to leave it for Mr X to deal with on his return. Unfortunately for the kin inEkona, Mr X was delayed so they were forced to bury the corpse themselves.When Mr X eventually returned, he decided, as is customary, to visit his kin tomourn the loss. When he and his two wives arrived at Ekona, their greetingswere answered with an unwelcome silence. Shunned by his kin, Mr X decidedhe and his wives should leave. But before they did, the ‘silent kin’ confrontedhim and told him he must visit the deceased’s grave. Mr X said that if he did, hewould do so of his own volition, not under obligation. This infuriated therelatives, who insisted more adamantly that he visit the grave. When he made itclear that he would not go, however, his relatives beat him and accused him ofbeing responsible for the young man’s death. The beating, they argued, waspunishment for being vicious (selling his kin to Nyongo) to his relatives. Theystabbed him with knives and other weapons; one female relative even stabbedhim in the eyes. His first wife was also allegedly assaulted, since she was anaccomplice to her husband’s occult practices. She was only rescued by theintervention of another relative who claimed that Mr X, not she, was the realperpetrator. She then quickly fled and alerted the police, but only too late. Bythe time they arrived, Mr X was dead. Sometime prior to all this, Mr X had a serious accident on the Limbe –Mutengene road, damaging his pickup irreparably. He survived unscratched,which again people saw as mysterious. He had been taken to hospital where hespent some time but eventually left without any problems. Rumour had it thatthe accident was caused by his fellow occult members who had demanded thathe sacrifice a victim, which he was reluctant to do. The young boy’s death inEkona was therefore seen as providing this sacrifice, to forestall the threat to hisown life by his occult associates. Case twoThe following is the story of Mrs BX, wife of Dr MX, professor in aCameroonian state university. As in the preceding story, we see the tensionsbetween various communities in which people vest their successes and failures,and the importance of negotiation of individual agency through conviviality.We see, too, the complex epistemological framework of cause and of powerwithin which these tensions take form and negotiations take place. Mrs BX comes from a strongly Catholic Grassfields family and is well-educated. Both her parents are highly-qualified, long-time primary and secondaryschool teachers. She was one among five brothers and two sisters; though in1980 her eldest brother died, and in 1998 she lost her immediate junior brother.All her siblings have either studied or worked in Europe. Her immediate olderbrother, ZP, went to study in Britain in 1982 and returns home only for brief38 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"visits. He has a doctorate, a well-paying job, a British passport, owns a house inLondon, and recently married a woman from his native Grassfields. Throughhim, three brothers and two sisters have reached Europe as well, including theone who died in 1998. All are reasonably comfortable, and keep in regularphone and e-mail contact with their parents and sister in Cameroon. Theyroutinely send home modern consumer goods, and sometimes money, for villageprojects. Mrs BX would have joined them in Europe, were she not happilymarried and the mother of six children. Like her parents, she is a secondaryschool teacher, but with a higher qualification from the University of Yaounde.The following is what Mrs BX, a family friend, kindly shared with me afterthe loss of her brother in June 1998. Her story not only highlights the pointmade throughout this chapter about the visible and invisible as complementaryin the popular epistemology, but also a common understanding of what it meansto succeed. Personal success or achievement counts for very little unless it alsoincludes one’s extended family. Focusing merely on the immediate family(parents and siblings) is insufficient. When YY, my maternal uncle died, I was a high school student in Kumba.He came and stood by my bed in my sleep. His lips firm, he looked at me fora long time. One week later my eldest brother, QN, died. Just before BV, myjunior sibling died in June this year, I had the same dream. My brother QNcame and stood by my bed in my sleep, tears in his eyes, but they did notroll down his cheeks. He came with a car, a pickup. There was something init, which I couldn’t quite figure. I called him and asked: ‘QN, what’s theproblem, why have you come to me with such a sad face?’ He didn’t talk.Then I called him by his nickname, and he looked at me and drove off. Thefollowing day my maternal cousin in Douala, LA, came with news that BV’sdead. My siblings in Europe called her and told her this. BV died in a caraccident, the only one of five passengers to lose his life in the mysteriousaccident.When ZP came with the corpse from Europe to the village, papa CC, myfather’s paternal first cousin, was so happy that he even distributed free drinksto people in an off-licence bar. He went to the stream to fetch water and metsome women there and was also happily telling them about BV’s death. Heswore that my father hadn’t seen anything yet – that is how the children willbe coming back home one after the other, in coffins. Just as he was about toreturn home with his water, he fell and seriously fractured his leg. The womenpresent said: ‘You see how God is punishing him? How can you rejoice overthe death of your brother’s child?’ They called some nearby men who rushedhim to the hospital where he stayed for a month. One of his sisters also saidmy father wanted to show off his riches, the fact that he has children abroad.‘These are they coming back in coffins,’ she rejoiced. [. . .]After the death ceremony my cousin, LA, in Douala, went and met afemale diviner from Bafang based in Douala. This diviner revealed to herDevelopment and witchcraft in Cameroon 39"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"the cause of BV’s death and what was to come in the future. She askedfor my mother to come to Douala immediately. Cousin LA sent word tomy mother and she came and met the diviner. The diviner told her aboutmy youngest brother, UT, how my father’s cousins were planning to sendan old woman to Italy by witchcraft. This old woman would be walking onthe road and someone driving, in an attempt to dodge her, would hit UTand kill him. The diviner asked that my mother should go to the villageand bring certain things for her to use to stop the accident from happening.My mother was to bring UT’s clothes, gather stones and 5 Francs CFA andthrow them into the sea in Douala. The diviner would use the clothes toinvoke UT’s double to appear. While my mother was still at the motor park[waiting]for a lift to Bamenda, the diviner sent LA to call for her. She saidthe old woman had already been sent to Italy and within that week theaccident was to occur, that she was going to use another method to stopit. She said she couldn’t do it alone, since the treatment was to take a weekand within that time she was to have her period [menstruation]. So shehad to go to the north of the country to meet her fellow diviner to continuethe work, because she is not supposed to do any work when she is havingher period.Before she went to the north, the diviner asked my mother to go andbring soil from our compound in Bamenda, from the front and back of thehouse, and also from papa CC’s compound. But when my mother got up byfive o’clock, papa CC was already in front of his house. This confirmedwhat the diviner said that whatever my mother was doing, papa CC wasaware of it. However, she managed to get the soil. While in the north, thediviner and her partner also discovered other revelations about us. She saidthat they wanted to distract my husband from me and to make me and thechildren suffer, and [that] eventually I will go mad.Just before ZP returned for his wedding in October this year, the divinerwarned that ZP should be very careful because they would be out to get himthis time. So my mother asked that my cousin, LA, come with the divinerto the village to explain to my father her findings, and also to work on ZP[fortify him against evil forces]. The diviner also did something in thecompound, to protect it from mysterious happenings. Because of herpresence in the compound, my father’s female cousins did not come for thewedding. As for papa CC, he had not visited the compound for five years.A few weeks ago, I had a dream that papa CC gave ZP some T-shirts andasked him to distribute them, and whoever got these T-shirts wouldautomatically be taken to Nyongo [sacrificed to the occult]. So when I sawZP with the T-shirts I shouted at him: ‘Why did you accept these T-shirts?Don’t you know the implications of these shirts?’ So ZP held the shirts anddidn’t know what to do with them. This same dream recurred two or threenights later. In the third dream, ZP’s hands were tied behind him and to achair; his mouth was tied as well. And they asked him to call his mother to40 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"come and help him. I was so frightened in the dream that I awoke abruptly.All of these dreams happened before the death of papa CC last week. In my thinking, I thought that papa CC wanted to do something but waspre-empted. There is also a male diviner in Bamenda whom my mothermet. My mother and father and this diviner went to the outskirts of thevillage, killed and buried a dog and performed certain rites. In the course ofburying this dog, the diviner said that anybody who tried anything againstus would die like that dog. Even the Bafang diviner from Douala buriedsomething – a lock – in the compound, and said that anybody who tried tounlock it would fail and then die.In a telephone conversation the other day, I told ZP in London aboutthe dreams and he told me that he also had a similar dream in which he wasgiven a cap, not T-shirts. And he recalled having been given caps when hecame home with BV’s corpse. So immediately he went and looked for thecaps and said he was going to burn them. He advised me that whenever Ihave a dream in which I am fighting with a snake or a dog or anybody, Ishould make sure I kill them or I overcome the person. If it is water or acanoe I shouldn’t enter any of them. There is always the belief that whenyou have a dream and you are fighting and you don’t overcome a person andthe person overcomes you, it is a bad sign.These two accounts both concern people from the Bamenda Grassfields ofCameroon, whose ideas of personhood, agency and success are illustrative of thepopular epistemology. Both cases present development or modernity as a bazaarto which many are drawn but few rewarded. In the first case, Mr X educates hisbrother’s children under the delusion that education would bring them salvationand success. They migrate to urban areas with certain ‘expectations ofmodernity’ (Ferguson 1999). But this has led to unemployment, disillusionmentand anxieties. Paradoxically, Mr X, a man of little education himself, continuesto accumulate riches to the point that he can loan the Christian Men’sFellowship nine million Francs CFA for luxuries like uniforms. The educationhe gave his brother’s children has proved of little value, and the children arebound to wonder if his apparent generosity was not a con after all – a suspiciononly compounded by the fact that the very nephews and nieces he supposedlycares for are dying mysterious deaths while his own children remain untouched.At the end of the day, far from being the source of salvation as he had hoped, heis treated instead as the family’s curse, someone who has chosen personal successto the detriment of collective welfare. He has failed to domesticate his agency asan individual, and proceeds to consume his kin instead. For his greed, he mustpay the ultimate price: a brutal death, the fate he supposedly reserved for hiskin, those for whom he pretended to care.In the second case, it is obvious that Grassfielders are intolerant of narrowdefinitions of success or of family. Although Mrs BX’s parents have achieved alot in educating their children who, in turn, have shown gratitude byDevelopment and witchcraft in Cameroon 41"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"maintaining family solidarity and redistributing the fruits of their success, it isevident that the wider family is critical of their narrow definition of family andsuccess. As long as the larger family is not integrated clearly and unambiguously,as long as they are not made to feel part of that success, there is a problem.Again we see development or modernity in the Grassfields as an essentiallyinegalitarian process wherein few rejoice, even when there is limited success.Mysterious deaths and death threats are supposed to instil reason in all thatcapricious modernity must be encountered jointly to ensure that individuals andtheir kin triumph together, or comfort one another if they fail.Domesticated agency and the management of successIn the Grassfields, people’s meticulous distinction between good and bad personsof all types speaks eloquently of a conviction that no agency is rewarding forthe collectivity, or even, ultimately, for the individual if undomesticated.Undomesticated agency is greed, and success that comes from greed can onlybe achieved by sacrificing others or their interests, as my study of the notionsofAwung (an ambivalent type of clairvoyance and clairvoyant) and Msa(adangerous, mysterious and attractive world of infinite possibilities and abundance)in Bum show (Nyamnjoh 1985). Apart from variations in appellation, thenotions of Awungand Msaare common throughout the Bamenda Grassfields.Understanding them is key to understanding ideas of success in the area. Ingeneral, Grassfielders tend to believe that ‘personal success is essentiallydestructive unless seen to be acting for the good of all and this ensures that suchachievements should be accompanied by egalitarian redistributory mechanisms’(Rowlands 1994: 17).In his study of personal success in the Bamenda Grassfields, MichaelRowlands points out that, in this region, people believe that personal successalways comes at the expense of others. ‘Someone who suddenly acquires wealthor good fortune has done so at the expense of close relatives or friends’, who areusually thought to have been ‘made into zombies’ and ‘given to societies ofsorcerers to work for them and produce wealth in return for the good fortunegiven to one of their members’ (Rowlands 1994: 15). It is believed, he observes,that ‘if someone has success in business or politics, has many wives, many goats,or a bountiful harvest of yams or groundnuts, . . . that success must necessarilyhave been at the expense of someone else’s career or that he/she will havesucked the fertility out of the families, livestock or fields of someone else’(Rowlands 1994: 15–16). Thus his conclusion that the Bamenda areashares a mercantilist philosophy according to which resources are in a fixedand limited supply and what someone has ‘eaten’ is appropriated at theexpense of the whole society. Life in itself is part of the bargain, and ifsomeone is sick or dies, it must be that someone has sucked away his/her lifeto feed on it. The wealthy will have to take this into consideration and42 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"should people experience misfortune or die among his kin and neighbours,accusations may arise.(Rowlands 1994: 17) Agency as the ability to manipulate oneself into a position of abundance whileothers struggle to get by, is perceived as destructive to others and, ultimately, tothe accumulating individual too, as discussions below of the ambivalence ofMsaand awungfurther demonstrate. It is not enough to belong to a group orcommunity; such belonging must impact positively on one’s kin to be recognized.So while it could be argued that even the villains and sorcerers described belowidentify with communities at Msaor form communities of awungrespectively,the fact that they are considered destructive to their own kin and communities,means they are neither recognized nor legitimated. This ethos is well-articulated in ideas of personhood and agency in theGrassfields. The beliefs and categories explored below are of course neither staticnor uncontested. Nonetheless, they are widely shared and invoked, particularlyin times of stress, misfortune and uncertainties (Geschiere and Nyamnjoh1998). In what follows, it is evident that Msaand awungare central to commonunderstandings of, and beliefs about, how the world should be organized tomaximize everyone’s interests. Since people are born with different abilities, andbecause shortage is a fact of life, it is important for the extra-gifted to harnesstheir awungand knowledge of Msaso the less well-endowed can benefit too.Using one’s talents for personal gratification alone is likely to occasion moreconflict and pain than satisfaction and pleasure for all, talented or not.Most people in the Bamenda Grassfields believe in a supreme God (Fyen)who is responsible for creation. He endows some individuals with clairvoyance(seba= two eyes), others with innocence (seimok= one eye). The ‘clairvoyant’are said to be endowed with an ability (sing. fintini; plur. fintitu) to see and docertain things that their ‘innocent’ counterparts cannot. Clairvoyants arecommonly called clever people (sing. wutatoffana= person of sense; plur.ghetatoffana), meaning manipulative and slippery. The innocent is associatedwith short-sightedness, incapability and, at times, foolishness. The verb ‘to see’(yen)is sometimes used to distinguish between the clairvoyant and the innocent,and means the ability to perceive, even the invisible. The former sees (yenalo),and the latter sees not (yenawi).To those who share this belief, ‘clairvoyant’ and ‘innocent’ are the only twocategories of person: everyone is born one or the other. However, each categoryhas two subcategories. A clairvoyant might be associated either with AwungorMsa. Awung(pl. uwung) are further subdivided into two: Wise person (sing.awungadzunga= good awung; pl. uwungudzungu); and Sorcerer (sing. awungabe=bad awung; pl: uwungube). Msa or Cunning (sing. wutamsa= person of Msa; pl.ghetamsala) is the appellation of the second subcategory of clairvoyant, which isalso subdivided into two: Sly (sing. wutamsamdzung= good person of Msa; pl.ghetamsamdzunga); and Villain (sing. wutamsamba= bad person of Msa; pl.Development and witchcraft in Cameroon 43"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"ghetamsambe). The innocent fall into either of two subtypes: Medium (sing. wut-ni-toffotu= person with intelligence; pl. gheta-ni-toffotu); or Inept (sing. ayung,ngwo, mumu= person capable of nothing great; pl: wuyung, wungwo, wumumu).People believe that awungis practised the world over. Sorcerers are generallyassociated with lies, gossip, treachery, jealousy, egoism and wickedness. Accordingto some of my informants, a person who publicly disagrees with the majoritymust be a sorcerer, for no one else would dare. Awungis identified through aperson’s actions and words most of the time, since no one has ever ordinarilyseen another actually eating human flesh. Sorcerers eat or deplete their victimsmysteriously at night, because, an individual may be said to have been eaten,when in reality he/she is still alive and going about his daily activities. However,it is said that even then, the victims are just like shadows of themselves, theirhearts having been taken out and eaten, their life-essence gone. They may bevisible but they have been killed in the world of the invisible.Sorcerers are seen as destructive, jealous people, opposed to progress. Theytend to hunt in the house rather than in the bush. Sorcerers, like villains, mustchoose their victims among their kin, and are expected to prove intimacy byremoving their victims’ amulets; it is very dangerous for a sorcerer to removesomeone’s amulet with whom he or she has no kinship ties. Sorcerers canenhance their clairvoyance with medicine or magic. This further empowersthem and makes them less vulnerable to other sorcerers, or to diviners, of whomthey are very suspicious. Sorcerers’ relationships with diviners are marked bymutual fear and distrust, and people say that sorcerers would not hesitate topoison diviners they see as traitors. If sorcerers are those who have severed linkswith the community of kin entirely, diviners are those with a foot in both worlds,straddling the realities of the kin and the undomesticated agency of the sorcerers.From the foregoing discussion of personhood, it is evident that Msarepresents an important dimension in certain mainstream understandings ofagency in the Grassfields. Most people believe Msato be a mysterious world ofabundance and infinite possibilities. It is present everywhere – at home, in ariver, and the bush – and can be made visible by ‘Cunning’ individuals. It issometimes called Kunta, Nyongo, Famla, or Kupeh, following exposure to newforms of witchcraft by those who have migrated to the cities and plantations insearch of a better life (cf. Ardener 1996). Only ‘Cunning’ individuals can visitMsaanytime, anywhere. Msais a world of beauty, abundance and marvels,where everything can be found. It is inhabited by its own people who look nodifferent from ordinary people. The people of Msalive in even better houses,but speak local languages; just as the people of Msaof other communities speakthe respective languages of these areas. Msacan be found everywhere in theworld. But its inhabitants are very wicked, hostile and vicious; they are whatpeople call devils (deblisu).Villains, when they want something valuable, take their victims to Msato betethered like goats. Msais like a market, complete with traders and buyers, abazaar where many come but where few are rewarded. To get what one wants,44 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"one must bargain and pay for it. But the only currency in Msais human beings,variously referred to as ‘goat’ or ‘fowl’. At Msa, villains can only get what theywant after complete payment. Villains who fail to honour their debts must paywith their own lives. The number of ‘fowls’ or ‘goats’ to be paid, once agreedupon, cannot be revoked. This is why, while at Msa, the more sensible ‘Sly’individuals are hesitant to promise payments or to enter into debt.People also believe that anything that comes from Msamultiplies or pro-liferates. Msais, above all, an ambivalent place – full of good and bad, pleasureand pain. As BebenKtteh of Fonfuka put it:At Msa, you are first shown only the good, the fantastic, the marvellous.This normally attracts you. Then you are trapped and caught. And you die.It is after death that you are shown the other phase of it – the bad anddistasteful aspect of it. At Msa, after your death, you are enslaved completely:You are ill-treated, overworked, discriminated against and so on. Sometimesits inhabitants use you as a pillow on their beds, ask you to work on theirfarms, to carry water for them, wash their dishes and so on. And you do allthis work when their own children and themselves do just nothing.Msais a world of extremes. In it, there is more good than one can imagine, andmore evil than the imagination can grasp. Msais both good and evil, and noone can have one without the other. Yet Msa’s most problematic aspect is thatevil is seemingly enveloped in goodness; one often gets more than one sees. Thepersonal success Msaappears to offer is ultimately an illusion; so, also, is thesemblance of a new solidarity and a counter-community it creates in individualsby encouraging them to sacrifice their own kin and traditional alliances. Whenlife becomes hard, Msa’s true ethos – greed and callous indifference – come tothe fore, and individuals must make the ultimate sacrifice: giving their ownlives. In other words, there is no group spirit, solidarity or collective conscious-ness at Msa; only individuals seeking to maximize their greed, and sometimespaying the ultimate price. Interdependence, interconnectedness and inter-subjectivity seem to threaten the very existence of Msa; hence its violentopposition to all attempts at conviviality between the individual and his or hercommunity of origin. The surest and safest way to benefit from Msawithoutbecoming trapped by its evils is to be a ‘Wise person’; that is, choosing not tobelong fully to Msabut to act as a bridge between the two worlds. In otherwords, domesticating one’s connections with Msa is the surest way of survival forMsa, the individual and his or her kin.From the foregoing, it is hard to resist seeing Msaas analogous to moderncapitalism, especially as experienced on the periphery (cf. Warnier 1993a:159–162; Ardener 1996: 243–260): its rhetoric of emancipation and empower-ment for the individual who sacrifices family and custom to embrace modernity,on the one hand, and the harsh reality of exploitation, zombification, debase-ment, depletion and disenchantment it occasions, on the other. Many scholarsDevelopment and witchcraft in Cameroon 45"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"have explored the relationship between persistent beliefs in Msaand otherforms of witchcraft and the changing nature of capitalism and its effects on theperiphery. While local beliefs in Msapredate the transatlantic slave trade, andcommunication between the Grassfields and the coastal regions predatescolonialism and plantation agriculture, current discourses or narratives on witch-craft in the Grassfields are heavily coloured by the symbols and associations ofcapitalism. Most recent analyses have explained the resurgence of witchcraftbeliefs in mysterious centres of accumulation in Cameroon and elsewhere inAfrica, with the globalization of poverty, uncertainty, and anxiety generated byconsumer capitalism. While witchcraft cannot be explained by the impact ofcapitalism alone, neither can we ignore it, since the tremendous expansion ofthe market economy in recent years ‘has given a new impetus to the idioms ofaccumulation and dis-accumulation through various kinds of leakages’ (Warnier1993b: 310).The ideas of Msaand awungcan be seen as statements both againstundomesticated agency, as well as against capitalism’s illusion of thepermanence of personal success. Like capitalism, Msaand awung, whenunharnessed, bring power and opportunities to only a few – those with theclairvoyance and greed to indulge in them. Like global capitalism which catersto the needs of investors, advertisers and affluent global consumers, theundomesticated pursuit of Msaand awungenhances the self-seeking individualsat the expense of family and the wider community. It is only by marginalizingfamily and collective interests – by manipulating, exploiting or taking advantageof others – that the selfish pursuit of clairvoyance can afford for its disciplespersonal success (Rowlands 1994, 1995; Warnier 1993a: 163–196). But suchsuccess is merely an illusion because, like consumer capitalism,Msaand awungare seemingly eternal cycles of indebtedness, manipulation, zombification andthe never-ending search for fulfilment. The appetitesMsaand awung bring onlygrow stronger, and those who yield to their allure are instantly trapped andultimately consumed, but not before consuming their own and others’ sociality.This impermanence of success even at the personal level is indicative of howagency as independence only creates dependence, and provides further evidencefor interdependence or domesticated agency as the only way of curbing the‘radically widening chasm between rich and poor’, and the ‘uneasy fusionof enfranchizement and exclusion, hope and hopelessness’ (Comaroff andComaroff 1999a: 19), that Msa, global capitalism or modernity seems to bringabout in marginal communities.ConclusionThis chapter has argued that there is much to be gained by going beyond thedominant western epistemological export for understanding witchcraft andoccult practices in Africa. It points to the popular epistemology among ordinaryAfricans as the way towards a more comprehensive understanding of these46 Francis B. Nyamnjoh"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"phenomena and how they have informed alternative appreciations of develop-ment or modernity on the continent. Far from contradicting the westernepistemological import, the popular epistemology actually complements orcompletes it. The chapter argues for a more rounded picture of reality, one thatprovides for both the visible and invisible dimensions of our world. Not doingthis means subscribing to the dichotomies or dualisms that limited and limitingsocial science as ideology has imposed on Africa in terms of theory and method-ology. How we understand witchcraft and its relationship to developmentdepends critically on one’s theoretical and methodological perspective. In otherwords, it depends on one’s epistemological assumptions about reality.

It makes it possible forgovernment to feed the people not with facts but with opinions only, so that theyremain incapable of thinking for themselves. Truth, the Indomitable Lion of politics[Biya] has never tired of affirming, comes from above and rumour from below (lavérité vient d’en haut, la rumeur vient d’en bas). Hence the constant exhortation forCameroonians to take for truth everything communicated to them by CRTV andCameroon Tribuneor by writings published in honour of the system by pro-establishment academics. They are in turn to shun ‘untruths disseminated by certainmedia, with scant regard for the most elementary of journalistic ethics and atvariance with the rules and means of seeking the truth’. Information from any sourceother than these official media, ‘the most trustworthy and credible sources’, couldonly be, as Paul Biya himself termed it, by ‘insensitive and ill-intentioned people . . .who want to claim an importance that they haven’t got’ (Cameroon Tribune,No.3080, 21 September 1984).To mark his importance as premiere vehicle of ‘truth from above’, Mendo Ze asdirector of CRTV has physically located his office on the 11th floor of the CRTVproduction centre at Mballa II in Yaounde, and has also reserved a lift for himself. Inthis way, his authority is practically reinforced by the feeling of physically sitting oneveryone of his journalists, producers and support staff. Supplemented by mystical oroccult powers, he and President Biya could see themselves as metaphorically sittingon all Cameroonians, big and small, willing and reluctant. Under Biya, CRTVassumed the same dictatorial and insensitive stature that Radio Cameroon hadassumed under Ahidjo. And with this has come an arrogance unmitigated byignorance on the part of politicians in high office and journalists in their service.From the public’s perspective, only someone super endowed with more than meetsthe eye could display with impunity the arrogance and insensitivity of President Biyaand such acolytes as Mendo Ze. One requires more than ordinary political orbureaucratic power to do what they do, and get away with it. Such power is invisibleand is provided by witchcraft and occult practices in which they indulge with theassistance of the stifling misery of their victims.Development and witchcraft in Cameroon 47"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"4Nouvelle Expression, 15 January 1999 and 24 March 1999.5 Nor are such rumours just a 1990s phenomenon.

A Charge that your petitioner is quite innocent of.(Testimony of Kiyelleh, 1892, in Milan Kalous 1974: 217)Historicizing cannibalism storiesIn the literature on modernity and the occult imaginary, such creatures asHuman Alligators, zombies, witches, and cannibals are usually located in an ageof postcolonial states and structurally adjusted economies.1These images speakeloquently of the ruptures of postcoloniality, the contradictions of modernity,the ‘eating of the state’ (Geschiere 1997), and the ‘violence of abstraction’(Comaroff and Comaroff 1999). At the same time, in a different strand ofscholarship on postcoloniality, others have commented on the ways in whichvarious kinds of postcolonial experiences reinscribe colonial ones.2In thischapter, I wish both to tie these strands together and to push the implications ofthe second strand further, arguing not only that many of today’s images of occultextraction are mediated by colonial memory, but also that in some parts ofAfrica, experiences of colonialism were themselves configured by memories ofearlier transregional processes, such as the Atlantic slave trade. Postcolonialitymay be simply the most recent historical predicament in which commodifi-cation and rupture are experienced in images of cannibalistic or vampiric occultbeings – images that have been continually refashioned, creating accounts thatare both ‘new’ and ‘old’ (Shaw 2002).At a particularly turbulent point in Sierra Leone’s colonial past, during thelate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, accounts of ritual murder multi-plied in the Sierra Leone hinterland. The epigraph above comes from a seriesof accusations and confessions concerning the ‘cannibalism’ of deadly were-animals – ‘Human Crocodiles’, ‘Human Leopards’, and (later) ‘Human Chimp-Chapter 3Cannibal transformationsColonialism and commodification in the Sierra Leone hinterlandRosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"anzees’ – that were described as capturing and ritually slaughtering people inorder to make wealth-producing medicines from their victims’ vital organs.Accounts such as these, as White (2000) demonstrates in her remarkableanalysis of vampire stories in East and Central Africa, mark a way in whichrelationships entailed by colonial rule could be debated, evaluated, and com-mented upon. But in addition, as I hope to trace in this chapter, these colonialHuman Crocodile and Leopard accounts in the Sierra Leone hinterlandreworked memories of still earlier rumours of ‘Atlantic’ cannibals – rumours thatspoke to morally deleterious forms of power and commerce in Sierra Leone’sslave-trading past.Tracing stories of cannibalism historically and exploring them as forms ofsocial memory, however, grates against a longstanding axiom in bothanthropology and history that we cannot ‘explain’ a cultural idea or practice interms of its origins (White 2000: 15–21). This is a critique of nineteenth-century arguments that reduce cultural phenomena to generic, unchangingforms disconnected from specific sociohistorical concerns as they persist throughtime. But it is time to reexamine this oft-reiterated axiom about ‘explanation’and ‘origins’ in the light of social memory, given that the work of memory ishardly that attributed to the ‘origin’ of a phenomenon in such arguments – thatof determining its own static passage down the years through passive humanvectors. Moreover, an overwhelming focus on the mutability of the past (‘thepolitics of the past in the present’) in both anthropology and history has tendedto obscure the mutability of the present – the ways in which memories form aprism for the configuring of present experience. Instead of a process of reduction,the work of memory entails a process of historical sedimentation in whichinherited cultural ideas and practices mediate the ways in which relationships,actions, and events are envisioned – and these ideas and practices are them-selves reconfigured in turn.Thus in Sierra Leone, stories and accusations of cannibalism have long been(and still are) a dynamic part of inherited cultural images that configure visionsof extractive relationships. These are, of course, different stories, told in differentways, at different times, and in different sociohistorical contexts. Yet I suggestthat successive stories about human consumption in a particular place do notsimply arise sui generis, born again and again in different circumstances,disconnected from memories of earlier stories. Viewing a history of Sierra Leonethrough the lens of cannibalism stories may, I suggest, enable us to see howpeople tie experiences of commodification and extraction to memories of earlierexperiences even as they rework those memories today.Cannibalism and conquest‘And even when they kill their enemies in battle they cut pieces of them anddry and smoke them and cook them with rice and eat it’, wrote ValentimFernandes of the inhabitants of Sierra Leone at the turn of the sixteenth centuryCannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 51"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"(1951 [1506–1510]: 94–95; English translation by Alice Clemente). Fernandesobtained his information from an informant called Alvaro Velho, who had livedin Sierra Leone for eight years. We do not know if Velho had witnessed thecannibalism he outlined (unlikely, in view of the sparse details he gave of apractice that would presumably have been startling to him), or reporting arumour, or giving a literal interpretation to the image of ‘eating’ as a metaphorfor defeat. All we can be sure of in this reference from five centuries ago is thatthere existed local ideas of cannibalism that were linked in some way withdefeat and capture in war.Earlier in Fernandes’ account, we find another reference to cannibalistic con-sumption – and this time, man-eating is attributed to European slave traders.Fernandes tells of a group of Portuguese further north, on the Gambia River,who were met by a fleet of canoes whose occupants shot arrows at them. Whenthe Portuguese managed to find a group of their assailants who would speak tothem through an interpreter, the Portuguese explained that they had come notto make war but to trade, as they did already with the people of the Canaga, andhad brought a gift for their king on behalf of the king of Portugal. Theiradversaries were not impressed:They replied that they knew well how we had dealt with people in theCanaga, and that the Christians ate human meat and that all the slaves thatthey bought were carried away to be eaten. And because of that they didnot want our friendship but they wanted to kill us all and to make a gift ofthem to their king who lived three days’ from there. And they shot themwith arrows. (Fernandes 1951 [1506–1510]: 34–35; Englishtranslation by Alice Clemente)In this story of the cannibalism of European traders we can, I suggest, catch aglimpse of the early incorporation of the Atlantic trade into local meanings of‘eating’. Although we know next to nothing of these meanings in this time andplace, it is clear that for this belligerent group on the Gambia at the turn of thesixteenth century, rumours of the European consumption of slaves identifiedtrade with ‘Christians’ as a form of predation. In an area that had been incorpo-rated into long-distance trade flows well before the coming of Europeans(Brooks 1993; Rodney 1970), this was hardly a reaction of ‘isolated’ Africans tosudden commercial contact with the outside world. Rather, it was specificallythe kindof trade – a trade that fed the ‘Christian’ appetite for the consumptionof humans – that was viewed as problematic.We have a slightly better idea of the sociohistorical context of a later set ofcannibalism stories in Sierra Leone: those told about the conquest and rule ofthis area by a group called the Mane in the sixteenth and early seventeenthcenturies. When Mane raiders arrived on the coast of Sierra Leone in thesecond half of the sixteenth century and subsequently imposed their form of52 Rosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"kingship upon peoples of the area, Portuguese and other foreign contemporariesreported recurring stories that the Mane practised cannibalism (Brooks 1993:305). In Manuel Alvares’ account, for instance, captive concubines areslaughtered and cooked; captives are made to eat each other; a baby is seizedfrom its mother, stuffed with rice, and roasted on the fire; a father-in-law is fed(unbeknown) to his own daughter at a banquet in his honour; a child isfed the meat of his slaughtered compatriots; and a local, non-Mane governorwho criticizes the king is invited by the latter to a banquet in which he is tobe the intended meal (Alvares 1990 [c.1615], II, ch.11: 1–4). Some of thesestories recapitulate the association between reports of cannibalism and defeatand capture in warfare that were present in Fernandes’ account a century earlier.Others concern violations that erase and invert bonds of concubinage,companionship, affinity, kinship, and political office. If we note that Alvareswrote when local peoples were subsumed within Mane political structures andwere assimilating Mane military and cultural practices, while at the same timethey were also incorporating their Mane conquerors through marriage (Brooks1993: 303–305), these stories would seem to highlight contradictions in theseprocesses of mutual absorption across marked disparities of power. Thedescriptions of meals and cooking depict acts of commensality that (we canprobably assume) ordinarily created and maintained relationships, but are hereturned around to attack the very basis of moral connection among people: ‘Notonly do we consume you’, the Mane are made to say in these stories, ‘but we alsomake you consume each other.’There was a further context for these stories: a symbiotic relationship haddeveloped between Mane warfare and the Atlantic slave trade (Brooks 1993:293–294; Rodney 1970: 102). The warfare that was frequently associated withstories of Mane cannibalism – stories that may, moreover, have played off earlierstories of the ‘eating’ of war captives – was itself the means by which localAfrican bodies were captured and ‘consumed’ by the slave trade. If the storiesabout cannibalistic cooking and meals and gruesomely inverted commensalityexpressed concerns about incorporating the Mane conquerors into local commun-itiesthrough affinal ties, these concerns would seem an appropriate response tothe dangerous paradox of forging moral relationships with foreign overlords whohave sold large numbers of people from your locality. Whether or not Manecannibalism stories also drew upon earlier stories of the cannibalism of theAtlantic trade, the ‘eating’ of humans is a powerful image for the articulationof Mane warfare and state-building with a form of commerce in which‘consumable’ bodies were captured and sold before disappearing forever.Atlantic cannibalsOther stories, circulating not just in Sierra Leone but along the length ofAfrica’s Atlantic coast, were focused not on African intermediaries such as theMane, but on the Europeans who carried people away in the Atlantic trade. InCannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 53"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"contrast to the gruesome particulars in reports of Mane cannibalism, namelessand faceless Europeans are simply described as eating African slaves, either onthe slave ships themselves or at their distant destinations: there are no specificsof food preparation, cooking, banquets, or captives forced to eat their own kinand companions. If accounts of Mane cannibalism convey the difficulties ofbuilding affinal and other relationships with people who have conquered youand made your relatives and neighbours disappear into slave ships, the sparedepictions of European cannibalism on those ships or across the ocean conveythe idea of predatory foreigners with whom there is little or no direct relationship.These stories of white cannibalism were focused not on the European traderswho had settled on the coast, but on unsettled Europeans who carried captivesaway in ships, and those who received them at distant destinations. It was thusEuropeans in conjunction with the forms of transatlantic mobility and transportthey controlled who were important in these stories.3Here were foreigners andvessels whose transatlantic passage reconfigured the boundary of the ocean as aspace of deadly transformation, materializing the chilling convertibility ofhuman bodies, money, and foreign commodities as they moved back and forthacross the water (cf. Auslander 1993; Bastian 1992: 148–208; Masquelier 2000;Weiss 1996: 179–219; White 2000: 122–147). Although these vessels woveconnections between particular African places and the country of Europeansthrough the foreign goods they brought, these connections did not reduce theexperiential separation between ‘there’ and ‘here’ because the people carriedaway did not come back. The opaqueness of the exchanges that these shipsmediated across the ocean, moreover, was objectified in the opaqueness of theirown hulls, inside which the experience of the Middle Passage was hardly lessnightmarish than the imagined scenario of African bodies being broken downinto food (Curtin 1967: 313).Most of these stories about European cannibalism seem to have beenunelaborated but persistent and transregional, circulating in the west Africaninterior, on the coast, on slave ships, and even in the New World on the otherside of the ocean (Palmie 1995): these were Atlantic stories. Within theirusually sparse details, however, we can sometimes discern particular localmeanings (e.g. Ceyssens 1975: 528–529). Thus in John Matthews’ lateeighteenth-century account of Sierra Leone, we are told that understandings ofAtlantic cannibalism in the Sierra Leone hinterland extended beyond those ofsimple eating. An African captive sold to a European, Matthews claims,‘imagines the white man buys him either to offer him as a sacrifice to his God, orto devour him as food; and I have seen some of these poor wretched beings soterrified with apprehensions of their expected fate, as to remain in a state oftorpid insensibility for some time’ (1966 [1788]: 152). If these rumours ofEuropean cannibalism in the region of Sierra Leone entailed ideas of sacrifice –the ritualconsumption of a victim – that would distinguish them from moregeneric stories of Atlantic consumption. Let us explore this further.Ideas of Europeans who kill and consume captives as part of a sacrifice carry a54 Rosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"different – although no less grotesque – set of meanings from those of Europeansdevouring people for food alone. While I do not know the specific meaningsof sacrifices in the Sierra Leone hinterland two hundred years ago, animalsacrifices (both in contemporary Sierra Leone and elsewhere) commonlyengender beneficial and enabling transformations through the exchange of thevictim’s life for blessings and benefits (or, in the case of apotropaic sacrifice, forfreedom from harm) from an extra-human force to whom this life is offered. Therumours that Matthews reports depict a reversal of the position of Africanswithin that exchange, turning them from ritual participants into offerings.Instead of being those who benefit from a sacrifice’s generative circulations,African captives become the victims whose ritual slaughter benefits Europeanothers – a prospect so appalling as to throw many captives into ‘a state of torpidinsensibility’, Matthews (1966 [1788]) tells us. What sort of boon the white manwas viewed as receiving from ‘his God’ for such a sacrifice remains undisclosed.But whatever it was, these stories made it part of a European ritual process thatintegrated the transport of African bodies across the Atlantic into a further setof transactions with the Europeans’ God – a process that ultimately channelleda return flow of foreign commodities and money back to the rulers and bigtraders on the coast and rivers of Sierra Leone.The conviction that slaves carried away in the Atlantic trade were eaten byEuropeans persists in Sierra Leone to this day, although it is not linked to theidea of sacrifice. That linkage between cannibalism, sacrifice, and predatorytrade does, however, resonate in intriguing ways with ideas of the ritualcannibalism of Human Leopards and Crocodiles that circulated in the SierraLeone hinterland a century after Matthews’ account.Colonial power and ‘cannibal crimes’These cannibalism stories of the late nineteenth century erupted nearly seventyyears after British authorities in the Crown Colony of Sierra Leone, based inFreetown, had replaced the Atlantic slave trade with a ‘legitimate trade’ inproducts such as palm oil, palm kernels, camwood, and timber. The storiesentered the colonial record as rumours and reports of suspicious killings, as partof the correspondence between hinterland chiefs and colonial authorities, andas accusations and confessions in colonial court cases. The accounts were notspecific to any particular linguistic group. Instead, reports of these killings werecommon ‘in those parts of the forest zone most thoroughly transformed bycommercial contacts’ (Richards 2000: 89), especially in communities along thecoastal Sherbro area in the southwest and the major trade routes inland. In mostof these accounts, the human victims’ blood and organs were used either tocreate or to ‘enliven’ powerful medicines, while the killings themselves oftensimulated attack by leopards, crocodiles (‘alligators’), and chimpanzees(‘baboons’). Human Leopards, for example, were accused of ritually slaughteringtheir victims with a five-pronged ‘leopard knife’ in order to imitate the signs ofCannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 55"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"a leopard attack. Human Crocodiles were described as using a medicinecontaining a tiny model canoe (Kalous 1974: 83) that empowers humans toenter and animate either a crocodile skin (Kalous 1974: 76) or a ‘submarinecanoe’ that resembles a crocodile in the water.Murder by shape-shifting into leopards and crocodiles, termed ‘the witchcraftof the leopard’ (ra-ser ra an-sip) and of the crocodile (an-kuy) in Temne, was awell-known form of witchcraft long before the late 1800s (Matthews 1966 [1788]:130–132).4Such understandings were not merely abstract ideas; they formedpart of a divinatory process in which people accused and convicted as witcheswere sold into the slave trade by chiefs and other leaders (Shaw 1997). Butduring the nineteenth century, after the Atlantic slave trade was abolished, thecolonial government made treaties with hinterland chiefs (Wylie 1977: 73–74)in which the internal sale of slaves was prohibited. Thus severed from the processof the commodification of persons, witchfinding divinations that had for severalcenturies turned people into slaves by convicting them as witches eventuallytapered off.5But in the Human Leopard scare in the last quarter of that century,a different form of accusation developed in which established ideas of the shape-shifter’s witchcraft were synthesized with ideas of harmful ritual action bymalefactors in the more concrete form of Human Leopards. And this time, as weshall see, these stories were levelled againstchiefs more often than by them.For the colonial authorities who recorded and acted upon these accounts, thestories seemed readily appropriable into European conceptions of ‘cannibalism’and ‘Fetish Custom’ (Kalous 1974: 269), confirmations of ‘[t]he extraordinaryignorance and superstition of the Aborigenes’ (Kalous 1974: 32). As Abraham(1976) points out, such conceptions were used as justifications for colonial rule(Kalous 1974: 9, 279, 291, 304, 306). But ironically, these accounts of cannibalismthat were used to authorize the imposition of colonial force were stories thatspoke directly to the consequences of the colonial political economy (Abraham1976; Jackson 1989). Let me begin, then, to outline these consequences.Cannibalism and colonial commerceThroughout the nineteenth century (especially toward its end), the Colonyauthorities advanced their penetration of the hinterland, signing treaties,inserting themselves (where possible) into processes of chiefly succession,intervening in ‘trade wars’, sending punitive military expeditions, and forciblyannexing territory (Ijagbemi 1968; Jones 1983: 131–161; Wylie 1977: 91–189).Many of the struggles between the chiefs and the colonial government wereover control of the legitimate trade: chiefs considered it their right to regulatecommerce, levy tribute on trade goods, and assert their authority over traders byblocking the roads, much to the disapproval of the Colony (Wylie 1977: 74–75,91–128). Chiefs at that time had had a long history of collaboration with (andcontrol of) foreign traders, successively drawing in such strangers as sixteenth-and seventeenth-century Portuguese private traders and eighteenth-century56 Rosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Muslim merchants through intermarriage. While such collaboration betweenchiefs and traders remained strong during the legitimate trade (Richards 2000),chiefs were also aware that the wealth derived from this commerce gave tradersthe opportunity to become ‘big men’, to pay their own professional warriors, andthereby to challenge the chiefs (Ijagbemi 1968; Wylie 1977: 178; Jones 1983:128–130). When chiefs tried to assert their authority over both trade andtraders, however, the colonial government often stepped in to restrain them(Wylie 1977: 178).These struggles among chiefs, wealthy traders, and Colony were intensified inthe 1870s, when the demand for palm kernels increased rapidly (Mitchell 1962:205), and the rivers that were essential for the transport of palm products becamethe foci of violent commercial rivalries. At that time domestic slavery, slave-raiding, and warfare formed the nuclei of massive contradictions in the workingsof the legitimate trade. Domestic slaves, obtained by raiding weaker neighbours,were critical both for the production and porterage of cash crops for the trade,and for the cultivation of food crops to provision the chief ’s body of warriors(Ijagbemi 1968; Lenga-Kroma 1978; Wylie 1977). Chiefs and big men establishedsmall hamlets, called fakay, away from the town, and settled them with slaves(Abraham 1975: 135; Wylie 1977: 77), concealing them from raiders from otherchiefdoms who sought to seize both people and crops (Dorjahn 1960: 115 and121, n. 3). Chiefs then sold the cash crops and forest products produced by theslaves in these fakayin the legitimate trade, thereby enabling them to keep theirwarriors armed with the weapons that would maintain the flow of captured slaves(Wylie 1977: 85). At the same time, chiefs’ capacities to defend their chiefdomsfrom the raids of others depended on their warriors’ capacities for warfare andraiding, and therefore on the chiefs’ capacities to arm their warriors through thelegitimate trade and to feed them by acquiring and controlling domestic slaves(Ijagbemi 1968: 181–213; Lenga-Kroma 1978, I: 76–78, 153ff.; Wylie 1977: 85).The British, for their part, sought to eliminate all of these interconnectedprocesses – warfare, raiding, and internal slavery – that the legitimate trade hadhelped engender, and on which it depended. Thus ironically, as Wylie notes,‘[t]he very wars and raids which [the British] wanted to end provided . . . the onlycapital which many of the smaller societies . . . could generate in order to makethe system of exchange function; that capital was slaves’ (1977: 86).If these conditions meant a crisis of power and authority for the chiefs, theymeant terror for the chiefs’ subjects. It was at this time of intensifying con-tradictions and accelerating violence in the last two decades of the nineteenthcentury that accounts of Human Leopard and Crocodile killings multiplied. Theglobalizing connections forged in pursuit of the legitimate commerce – linkingtogether chiefs and Colony, warfare and enslavement, rural production and rivertransport, slave settlements and the global market – were experienced in terms ofthe violent disconnection of vital parts of the human body (Sanders, Chapter 8).In 1896, the British imposed a Protectorate on the Sierra Leone hinterland inorder to control the trade more directly and to suppress the warfare disrupting itCannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 57"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"(which, ironically, the trade had itself engendered). After this, the contradictionsof the legitimate trade took a different form: the Colony continued to promotethe trade, but forbade chiefs and big men from engaging in warfare, raiding, andthe internal trade in slaves. Although trade in slaves was prohibited, however,slavery itself was allowed to continue until 1929. Pragmatism forced the Colonyto compromise with the chiefs and big men over internal slavery, given that theColony still needed the trade with the Protectorate for its own economicsurvival (see Rashid 1999: 215). The chiefs’ access to labour was neverthelessconsiderably eroded by the prohibition on raiding and internal slave-trading,prompting them to seek alternative sources of labour and wealth. Many Protectorate chiefs found these sources in their capacity, through theirnew position as agents of Government, to ‘eat their chiefdom’ (Dorjahn 1960:111). While in relation to the Government itself their powers had beencurtailed, the checks and balances that had formerly curbed abuses of chieflypower over their subjects were gone. For southern Temne chiefs – sacred figureswho should not be allowed to die a natural death – the most importantconstraint had lain in the powers of their counsellors and subchiefs (e-kaper),who were empowered to kill the chief when he fell ill. In practice this hadmeant, as Dorjahn points out, that minor illnesses were overlooked in a popularchief, while ‘a wicked man was dispatched after the slightest decline in health orwell-being’ (1960: 114). This important sanction against a despotic chief waseliminated by the establishment of the Protectorate, while other powers of thekapersubchiefs were eroded, thereby removing the major checks on the chief ’sability to ‘eat his chiefdom’.For many Temne chiefs in the Protectorate era, the ‘eating’ of their ownchiefdoms effectively replaced their warriors’ slave raids on other chiefdoms inthe previous century. This ‘eating’ now took the form of monetized levies ontheir subjects that supplanted the tribute in food normally given (for example)after the harvest, of extortionate court fees and fines, extra-judicial fining, andthe attachment of their own additions to the colonial tax (Dorjahn 1960:130–135). It also took the form of labour levies for the cultivation of cash cropson the chief ’s farm – a farm that tended to grow larger and larger through landobtained in pledge, or through seizure following dubious rulings in the chief ’sown court (Dorjahn 1960: 134; Kalous 1974: 81). Additional labour couldlikewise be obtained through the court, as the chief would lend people moneyfor the court’s exorbitant fees if the plaintiffs were willing to pawn a son assecurity for the debt – an arrangement that became permanent when the courtcase was lost (Dorjahn 1960: 135).In the Protectorate era, then, trade with the Colony no longer entailed asystem of exchange that functioned through war, raiding, capture, and enslave-ment. Instead it now entailed chiefs’ ‘eating’ the land, pawned youths, andforced labour of their own subjects – subjects whose experiences of theirpowerful patrons, I suggest, found expression in the continued salience ofHuman Leopard, Crocodile, and Chimpanzee scares in the Protectorate era.658 Rosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Leopards of the legitimate tradeInstead of the anonymous and generalized European cannibals of the Atlantictrade, accounts of Leopard, Crocodile, and Chimpanzee killings identifiedknownindividuals: substantial numbers of chiefs and headmen were accusedof being alien were-animals outside the bounds of moral human existence.7Certain of their accusers claimed that the killings had been committed to‘make [the chief] powerful to govern the whole country’ (Kalous 1974: 107, also94, 166). Chiefs, in turn, claimed that such accusations against them werethe fabrications of discontented subjects (‘My countrymen do not like meas a Chief ’ [Kalous 1974: 277, also 132–133]). Some chiefs (and, morerarely, subchiefs) levelled accusations against their rivals – other chiefs,contenders for chiefly office, and wealthy subjects (Kalous 1974: 137, 195, 217,225, 236).Several traders in the legitimate commerce were also accused, either ascollaborators with (see Richards 2000) or rivals of the chief, including ‘a traderin palm kernels’ (Kalous 1974: 98), ‘a trader in a fairly large way at Bonthe’(Kalous 1974: 303), ‘a Merchant and paramount chief of Poro’ (Kalous 1974:85), and the trader Kiyelleh with whose testimony this chapter began, and whowas ‘blessed in cattle and many things sufficient to be regarded as a rich man’(Kalous 1974: 217). Like Kiyelleh, and in important contrast to those accused ofwitchcraft during the Atlantic trade, those identified as Human Leopards orAlligators were often wealthy: ‘Poor people are not accused of being humanleopards’, stated a witness, ‘[i]t is only rich people with property’ (Kalous 1974:196, also 194, 204, 219).Often, chiefs’ and big men’s ritual advisors were included in this indictment.These were usually Muslim specialists, known in Sierra Leone Krio as ‘morimen’ (Temne an-more) who divined, healed, and made amulets for rulers andother leaders. In Leopard accusations, the potency of ‘mori-men’s’ ritualknowledge was perceived as having been turned to their patrons’ sinisterpurposes; their divination techniques (‘Bundu proposed that Abdulai should beemployed to look country fashion to find the woman’ [Kalous 1974: 137]), theirsacrificial skills (‘The prisoner was a “medicine man”, and murdered the child’[Kalous 1974: 111]), their written amulets (‘The man who has [this writing]must get money, and it will make him a Chief ’ [Kalous 1974: 107]), and theirliquid Qur’anic medicine (‘Nessi is a medicine made by the Murri men and isused by the human leopard society’ [Kalous 1974: 161]) were all viewed ascarrying the potential for extractive, ‘cannibalistic’ rituals of individualempowerment and enrichment.8Significantly, those who accused chiefs, traders, and diviners of Leopard,Crocodile, and Chimpanzee killings often located those they denounced withinthe problematic transactions of trade with the Colony. Witnesses made repeatedconnections between cannibalism, human sacrifices, and the production ofwealth, often invoking the white man and trade with the Colony as the sourceCannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 59"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"of that wealth (Kalous 1974: 91, 93–94, 104, 116, 125, 170–172). A few alsoclaimed that the ritual substances and practices in question deflected colonialsurveillance (see Abraham 1976; Jackson 1989; Kalous 1974: 112).Human Leopards, Crocodiles, and Chimpanzees, moreover, were accused ofcatching and ritually consuming their prey in sites of rural production and alongroutes of transport for the legitimate trade. Instead of the European cannibalsof the Atlantic trade, who sacrificed and devoured their human victims in analien place – the enclosed interiors of slave ships, or the cannibal countryof Europeans – the local cannibals of the legitimate trade operated in the bushnear isolated farms and hamlets (fakay). Farms, Richards (2000) observes, arealways somewhat hazardous places for children during busy times of year,when chimpanzees may snatch unsupervised babies left at the edge of thebush, and ‘mug’ children running an errand between farm and village; butduring the Atlantic trade and the legitimate trade, he suggests, these hazardsof agrarian life took on a far more sinister significance (Richards 2000: 85).Indeed, the accounts gathered by Kalous confirm that it was the remote fakayin which slaves and other dependants cultivated cash crops for their patronsthat became particular sites of disappearance from which women and children –especially slaves’ children – would vanish under suspicious circumstances (‘Icame to the town and you made me go back to the farm: look how people havenow caught my son’ [Kalous 1974: 127, also 43, 97, 121, 141, 224, 271]).Collecting palm kernels – the principal crop of the legitimate trade at thattime – became a task of particular dread (‘No one can be enter into the bushor field under the palm trees for the purpose of getting the Kernels’ [Kalous1974: 34, also 40]). Likewise, the routes of transport along which these andother products were carried to the Colony became conduits for stalkingLeopards and deadly ‘Alligator canoes’ (‘the brooks and high ways areinaccessible unless under guard with guns and cutlasses’ [Kalous 1974: 218, also69, 70, 189–190]).The bush, the roads, and the navigable rivers had long been part of alandscape of death and disappearance during the Atlantic slave trade. But nowthis threat was transformed as the spatial separation between disappearance‘here’ and acts of cannibalism in a European ‘there’ had collapsed; now, inaddition to catching their prey, the ‘cannibals’ carried out their wealth-pro-ducing disassemblage of the human body ‘here’. Instead of Atlantic conversionsof human bodies into foreign wealth across the ocean, the legitimate trade’stransactions between Colony and hinterland entailed comparable conversions‘at home’, turning familiar places into sites of visceral extraction. Cannibals nolonger abducted their prey to another world; now they walked among ordinaryhumans, transforming the known world – just as they themselves had becometransformed – through processes of grotesque production and consumption.The animal predators that the cannibals became – leopards, crocodiles, andchimpanzees – are, Richards (1996a, 2000) points out, the only animals in theupper Guinea forests that will stalk and eat or mutilate humans. Richards60 Rosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"also suggests that peoples’ experiences of these predators were changed by thelegitimate commerce, given that the expansion in trade in forest products andthe swelling river traffic led to increased human encroachment upon theseanimals’ respective habitats (1996a, 2000). There are further reasons why theseanimals were prominent in the occult imaginary during the political-economictransformations of the legitimate trade. In Temne chiefdoms, for instance,leopards are ‘royal’ animals to whom the chief is sometimes compared (incoronations, for example), and hunters are obliged to give the skin, teeth,and claws of a leopard they kill to the chief of the chiefdom in which itis caught. In a sense, then, the chief is already a ‘human leopard’ – but onewhose power and stealth is supposed to protect and benefit his subjects. Thetransformative leopardskin clothing described for Human Leopards (‘the leopardskin . . . covered his whole face and was tied down at the back’ [Kalous 1974:55, also 58 and 62]) would thus seem to suggest the presence of chiefly powerturned rogue.As for crocodiles, Richards (2000) presents the intriguing argument that theymay index the relationship between traders and chiefs. He was told (in aMende-speaking locality) that the smaller broad-nosed crocodile in uplandforest streams is ‘mother’s brother’ to the more dangerous Nile crocodile of thelarger rivers toward the coast – a kinship terminology that, he argues, suggeststhe historical relationship established through marriage between the chief and‘Mandingo’ merchants involved in the slave trade (2000: 94). I would add thatthis image of a kinship connection between coastal and upriver predators mayalso recall intermarriages throughout the Atlantic trade era between chiefs’families and European slave traders – with the latter typically settled by therivers and plying the waterways upstream for slaves to deliver to the coast.While these kin ties might have ‘domesticated’ the strangers, they also integratedthe chiefs into predatory commercial flows down the waterways.Chimpanzees, for their part, are known both by rural Sierra Leoneans and byprimatologists, according to Richards (2000), for their occasional but seriousattacks on young, vulnerable humans – ‘mugging’ children, snatching babies, andsometimes biting victims on or near the genitals. Such behaviour, Richardssuggests, is disturbingly reminiscent of that of the raiders who, for severalcenturies, kidnapped young people in the Sierra Leone hinterland and sold theminto slavery (2000: 85).9This association between raiders and chimpanzees wasechoed in a striking narrative I collected from the former ritual subchief ofBombali Seborah Chiefdom, the late Pa Kaper Bana. Pa Kaper told me of a ‘FirstWorld’ (an-daru ra-totoko) that existed before this present one, whose angry,warlike inhabitants had habitually seized children and sold them; these people,he said, ‘were people who had hair on their skin, like the chimpanzee. They werenot of the same height as us. The first people were short, short, short, short’.10Thus not only do chimpanzee attacks trigger incidental memories of fighters whoemerge from the bush to carry off children, but in Pa Kaper Bana’s narrative thememory of those fighters has also been reworked in the image of the chimpanzee.Cannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 61"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Divining LeopardsIn several cases, Leopard, Crocodile, and (later) Chimpanzee accusations weremade in the context of rivalries between chiefs and wealthy traders: the traderKiyelle, for instance, claimed that Bay Simera had had him accused of being anAlligator because this chief envied Kiyelle’s wealth (Kalous 1974: 217). Tocontrol the process of conviction, certain chiefs now called divinations to findLeopards and Crocodiles among their subjects (e.g. Kalous 1974: 77, 194,196–197, 204, 218–219, 221). Given that the export slave trade was no longerviable, these chiefs did not enslave and sell those identified by the diviners, butinstead seized the accused’s property and slaves, fined their kin ‘according to [theaccused’s] rank and fortune’ (Kalous 1974: 214), and in some cases had thoseconvicted burned to death (the latter finally causing the colonial authorities tointervene [Kalous 1974: 217–219; Wylie 1977: 184]). These chiefs thereby notonly increased their wealth, but also eliminated their rivals.Yet as we have seen, chiefs were themselves accused at least as much asthey accused others – and their accusers were not only their wealthy rivals.Many dependants became witnesses against their powerful patrons in thecolonial courts, thereby using the colonial government for their own purposes –turning it, perhaps, into a kind of colonial diviner they could use to make visiblethe predatory acts of chiefs and big men. ‘People are ready to come forward withthese charges on the slightest provocation’, wrote a District Commissionerin 1931 (Kalous 1974: 66). While the colonial authorities placed emphasis ontheir own benign intervention in Leopard cases, we also need to recognize theagency of those who enabled (and often initiated) this intervention byrecounting to colonial agents their narratives of Leopards and Crocodiles,cannibalism and wealth, human sacrifice and bad medicines. Many slavesdenounced their owners (Kalous 1974: 225): an Assistant District Commissionerin Moyamba complained that ‘the only people who were prepared to comeforward and give evidence were Mendi slaves’ (Kalous 1974: 16).11In somecases slaves accused their masters of having compelled them to give up theirchildren to pay a ‘debt’ (‘If we have any child, it belongs to you and I cannotrefuse you’ [Kalous 1974: 139, also 120]). In coming forward, slaves and otherdependants risked being arrested themselves, but even then they were able tomake graphic confessions that subsumed their own actions within themalevolent agency of their patrons (‘Pa Neng . . . came back to own . . . that itwas Bai Sherbro who had always sent him to practice the catching of people inthe shape of an alligator’ [Kalous 1974: 80]).The localizing of cannibalsIn these accusations and confessions, wealthy patrons (or their lackeys) aresituated within a moral discourse of witchcraft. Some of these accounts –62 Rosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"especially in Temne-speaking areas – are explicit depictions of acts of witchcraftthat take place beyond ordinary human embodiment (‘it [the victim] was therein the form of a spirit’ [Kalous 1974: 89, also 231]), and by implication indreams (see Shaw 1992).12More usually, however, these accounts suggestconcrete translations of these ideas of witchcraft: acts ordinarily understood astaking place in dreams and ‘in spirit’ are fully materialized in the waking actionsof malefactors in the visible human world. Thus instead of (or as well as) shape-shifting into a leopard, Human Leopards don leopard skins and wield ‘leopardknives’. Instead of invisibly consuming their victims’ blood and internal organsin dreams, these ‘cannibals’ take blood and internal organs in fully enfleshedform to create or ‘feed’ wealth-producing medicines. And instead of belongingto a witches’ association in which each member incurs an obligation (a ‘debt’)to provide a victim in turn for a nocturnal feast in the other world (failingwhich the member will be killed and consumed instead), the malefic ritualactions of Human Leopards are located within a secret ‘Leopard Society’ with anidentical ‘debt’ arrangement, and whose nocturnal feasts are held in this world.Accounts of ‘materialized’ witchcraft, of apparently visible, tangible, and this-worldly acts of cannibalism, effectively translate witchcraft into a ‘language ofthe concrete’ that was more closely commensurable with the language of‘physical evidence’ in the colonial courts. Yet this language of the concrete inHuman Leopard accounts seems never to have been fully substantiated inconcrete objects and events in the material world, much to the puzzlement ofcolonial officials who were confronted with corpses but were never able to findthe paraphernalia of Leopard, Crocodile, and Chimpanzee disguises. Theseobjects had been described again and again in accusations and confessions, andwere sometimes even constructed as models: ‘No District Commissioner hasever been able to get hold of the Leopard dress, or knives’, wrote the ActingAttorney General, ‘altho’ models have been made from descriptions given bythe accomplices’ (Kalous 1974: 289 and see 58). The material reality of thesubmarine ‘Alligator canoe’ was equally mysterious. Accounts of this vessel inthe 1950s depict a fabulous but deadly vehicle with mysterious powers ofmobility and a simultaneously animal and machine-like appearance. Coveredwith animal skins (Kalous 1974: 85) and fitted with a hinged glass front ‘likethe glass windows of a car’ (Kalous 1974: 82, 72–73), it moved without paddles,and its occupants inside were able to ‘travel all night’ under the water (Kalous1974: 84). ‘How air is supplied, or how the hinged door can be open or closedwhen the canoe is under water, I cannot attempt to explain’, mused one official(Kalous 1974: 73).But one important aspect of Human Leopard accounts does not fit thispicture of cannibalism as concretely realized witchcraft. The killings that activate‘bad’ medicines are often identified as sacrifices, a ritual form that does not, tomy knowledge, ordinarily figure in understandings of witches’ invisibleactivities. Ordinarily, animal sacrifices (Temne as-athka) such as those I attendedin Temne-speaking communities from the late 1970s to the early 1990s areCannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 63"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"open, transparent, daytime events that – ideally, if not always in practice –connect kin and affines together when participants eat the cooked meat of thesacrificed chicken or sheep. The life (an-nesem) of the victim, embodied in theblood, heart, and liver, is released and consumed by the appropriate spirits andancestors, as well as by God (K-uru), engendering the beneficial flow of (forexample) abundant rice and healthy children to promote the continuity andcollective prosperity of the lineage or town. In contrast, the accounts of sacrifice that form part of Human Leopardaccusations entail the ritual offering of humans by those who are, in a sense,‘animals’. In hidden and nocturnal cabals in the bush, these ritual participantsrob households, lineages, and settlements (sometimes their own) of their youngermembers – a theft that has especially serious consequences for upland rice-farming communities whose subsistence depends upon the coordination oflabour (Richards 2000: 84). Thus instead of promoting the growth of healthyrice and children in the community, sacrifice by Human Leopards robs thevictim’s family and community of their capacity to feed, perpetuate, and renewthemselves. Severed from the living body, the life concentrated in the sacrificialvictim’s blood, heart, and liver – life that would have sustained the growth ofthe child into a productive (and reproductive) adult – now produces a flow ofpower and money for chiefs and big men. Meanwhile, severed from its youngmember, the victim’s family is left with a diminished capacity to produce andreproduce its future.If this aspect of Human Leopards’ noxious ritual actions represents a departurefrom ideas of ‘ordinary’ witchcraft, however, it also represents a convergencewith earlier stories of the Atlantic trade in which ‘the white man’ buys a captive‘either to offer him as a sacrifice to his God, or to devour him as food’(Matthews 1966 [1788]: 152). Thus while accounts of Human Leopards play offunderstandings of witchcraft, they also, I suggest, entail the work of memory,drawing upon ideas of wealth-producing but perverted forms of sacrifice from aprior ‘cannibalistic’ trade. But in contrast to the indeterminate, almost abstractedAtlantic sacrifices by generic white men, the sacrificial transactions of thelegitimate trade are given detailed depiction. Specific offerings are enumerated(‘the Murri men had told them to pull some “salaka”. . . [of] a black cow, a blackfowl and a crazy person’ [Kalous 1974: 163]); particular body parts (‘the genitals’[Kalous 1974: 66]) are used to prepare specific medicines (‘they had a fetish. ..the Bofima’ [Kalous 1974: 112]); and named ritual specialists prescribe thesacrifice and prepare the medicines (‘Abdulai said to him: “. . .the only way toget it is to kill your daughter or your sister”’ [Kalous 1974: 137]).Thus just as the invisible cannibalism of witches was made tangible inaccounts of the fully embodied cannibalism of Leopards, Crocodiles, andChimpanzees, the remote human sacrifices enacted by Europeans left theirAtlantic locations and were incorporated, in Leopard accusations, into accountsof a local corpus of clandestine ritual practice controlled by chiefs, big men,and their ritual specialists. The Atlantic trade’s replacement by the legitimate64 Rosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"trade did not, then, result in the disappearance of ‘cannibals’, but in theirbecoming more locallyembedded.These accounts and images of colonial-era cannibalism, shaped through theprism of Atlantic memory, contributed just as surely to the making of atransformed colonial world as did the new imperatives for the production andtransport of ‘legitimate’ goods, and the world markets in which these goodscirculated. Leopards, Crocodiles, and Chimpanzees did not merely clothe colonialtransformations in figurative cultural images; these images of entrepreneurialwere-animals helped form the colonial world itself.Postcolonial power and occult consumptionIf rumours of Atlantic cannibals were reconfigured during the colonial era inmore localized images of Human Leopards, this was not the end of theirmetamorphosis: accounts of Leopard, Crocodile, and Chimpanzee murders arenow colonial memories that have been reworked in postcolonial Sierra Leone,both before and during the current rebel war. And this time, their latestincarnations are rumours about political elites and combatant leaders.Seven years after Independence, in 1968, the long rule of the All People’sCongress (APC) began: this political party went on to preside over twenty-fiveyears of economic decline and escalating political corruption (see Reno 1995;Zack-Williams 1989). By the time I arrived in Sierra Leone for my first period offieldwork in 1977 and 1978, many ordinary Sierra Leoneans were describing therapacity of APC politicians and other ‘big persons’ in similar terms to those inwhich subjects in the colonial era had spoken of Protectorate chiefs who ‘atetheir chiefdoms’. Politicians and their covert foreign business partners, I wasoften told, consumed both Sierra Leone’s diamond wealth and the foreign aidintended for the poorest people of Sierra Leone, diverting it for the exclusiveuse of their own families. A Freetown diviner I knew, Pa Yamba, complained, forinstance, that ‘when they send money to this country from outside for the poorpeople, it goes to the big people. They sit on it, and their families eat it.’ Thusinstead of channelling the flow of benefits to their communities, big peoplearrest it by ‘sitting on it’, and thereby turning proper circulation into improperaccumulation. As Bayart (1993) and Geschiere (1997) have documented forideas about (respectively) ‘the politics of the belly’ and ‘the eating of the state’in contemporary Cameroon, this pattern of insatiable accumulation and con-sumption by politicians was (and is) for many Sierra Leoneans I knew a sign ofsinister occult predation (see Nyamnjoh, Chapter 2).Specifically, those politicians, top civil servants, and other big people who areviewed as especially rapacious are – like colonial-era chiefs – often the subjectsof rumours about ritual murder. These rumours have been recast since colonialtimes: with rural production for export shifted from forest crops to diamonddigging, with foot and canoe traffic replaced by motorized transport, and withthe near-disappearance of both leopards and crocodiles, only rarely are post-Cannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"colonial predators associated with forest animals (see Richards 2000). But theimagery of human commodification through sacrifice has been readily appropri-able as a commentary on the new forms of power wielded by those who (bothofficially and unofficially) control the state, its institutions, and its ‘shadow’economies. Thus rumours highlight covert connections between postcolonialleaders and sinister diviners who are suspected of performing human sacrifices inorder to obtain medicines of power and enrichment for their patrons (Shaw1996, 2002). In these stories, medicines derived from vital organs are describedas making political leaders ‘shine’ (Richards 1996a: 143–145; Ferme 1999: 170).Like the Human Leopard accusations of the legitimate trade, such rumoursconcerning the use of human body parts (especially reproductive organs, andespecially those of children and young women) make powerful statements aboutthe appropriation of others’ productive and reproductive capacities. Those fewwho, by enriching themselves through dubious means, have greatest access tothe products and privileges of globalized modernity in the form of westernconsumer goods and high-tech international mobility, are thereby associatedwith images that have come to carry both meanings of ‘backwardness’ andmemories of the malignant spiritual powers behind rapacious leaders.Even diviners themselves participate in this discourse. Some of the diviners Iknew – specialists who not only practised divination but also healed andprepared medicines – affirmed that they had prepared medicines to create orsustain the power of big persons, the ingredients for which were revealed by thetutelary spirit behind their powers. Once prepared, such medicines could beapplied by eating or drinking them, washing with them, boiling them andinhaling the steam, rubbing them into incisions in the skin, dropping them inthe eyes, wearing an undershirt soaked in them, sewing them inside a belt tiedaround the waist, or enclosing them in an amulet (Temne an-sebe) hung aroundthe neck.Those diviners who claim to have been ‘behind’ the success of a big personhave to tread a fine line between affirming their occult powers and yetdisclaiming the malefic use of such powers. One way of making such a disclaimeris to make use of stereotyped images of ‘bad’ ritual specialists in order tounderscore the differences between the latter and themselves. Pa Yamba, thediviner I quote above, put it this way during my 1992 visit:PY: What I do is the work of God (K-uru). I have seen them [the politiciansand other leaders] call big Muslim diviners (Temne an-lefa) to come tothis country. He says he wants power; he tells the diviner. Ah, Satan(Sethani)! The diviner says ‘I want blood’. Well, I who have power, now,I call the members who are behind me, if I’m a minister. Any power Iget, they will get it too. They will go and find a person to kill.RS: Where do the diviners come from?PY: Some come from Guinea, some from other countries. This work, Idon’t want it. It’s the money of Hell (an-kala na ro-yanama).66 Rosalind Shaw"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Pa Yamba thus appropriated the discourse that demonizes diviners for thepurpose of his own castigation of other specialists, using it to condemn powerfulforeign diviners outside Sierra Leone’s borders. The latter, he suggested, are anexternal evil drawn in from beyond the nation’s boundaries by an internalcorruption within the government. These foreign diviners from the Republic ofGuinea to the north (especially, he added, from the Futa Jallon area) are themodern counterparts of Muslim strangers who came and settled in the eighteenthand nineteenth centuries as ritual advisors to chiefs in the Sierra Leonehinterland. The ‘wonderful’ literate Islamic knowledge for which these specialistsare renowned is still recognized as superior, but is now indelibly associated withthe excesses of the most corrupt and nefarious political leaders. A strong moraldualism distinguished Pa Yamba’s own divinely-derived work (‘the work of God’)from their ‘Satanic’ activity and its diabolic reward (‘the money of Hell’). Buteven these ‘Satanic’ strangers, he pointed out, were driven by the (literally)consuming ambitions of local politicians and their followers.Through the transgressive forms of sacrifice and medicine that Pa Yamba andothers described, the ritual consumption of a human being’s life and potential isviewed as giving the politician – and through him, the diviner ‘behind’ hispower – access to the consumption of the wealth of the state. Thus ‘eating’people ritually, through the mediation of a diviner, confers the capacity to ‘eat’people politically, through the apparatus of the state (Shaw 1996, 2002). Non-discursive memories of human commodification during the Atlantic andcolonial eras, I suggest, have structured the agency of postcolonial subjects asthey experience the opacity and dangers of national politics, and reflect uponthe opportunities the modern state provides for its own forms of extraction.These forms of memory have, tragically, been rendered especially relevantduring Sierra Leone’s current rebel war, in which rumours circulate of thecannibalism of the rebels (see, e.g., Richards 1996b: 92) and of human sacrificesmade by combatant leaders.13Once again, such rumours are fitting expressions ofthe human costs of a war financed by diamonds and fought with the extractedlabour of young people who are treated – by all sides – as commodified resources(Richards 1996b, 2000). Richards suggests, in fact, that the moral critiquedeveloped in cannibalism stories might provide a useful basis for local debatesabout how to limit abuses of patronage and rethink patrimonial political culturein Sierra Leone (1996b: 160–161). Whether or not such debates take place, wewould do well to listen to what the discourse of cannibalism tells us about thememory of Atlantic commodities and the modernity of a twenty-first century war.Notes1 See, e.g., Auslander 1993; Bastian 1993; Ciekawy and Geschiere 1998; Comaroff andComaroff 1999; Fisiy and Geschiere 1996; Geschiere 1997; Masquelier 2000; Meyer1998; Weiss 1996.Cannibal transformations: Sierra Leone 67"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"2 E.g. Dirks 1992: 7; Cole 1998; De Boeck 1998; Ranger 1996; Stoller 1995; Werbner1998.3 In various parts of the Atlantic coast and its hinterland, images of cannibalism weretriggered by travel towards the coast, or by the presence of the sea, of a ship, and ofEuropeans (see, e.g., Park 1817, I: 484; Curtin 1967: 331).4 We should not assume, however, that the capacity to metamorphose into a wildanimal is (or was) always viewed as an unambiguously negative quality (see Jackson1989: 102–118).5 Although the external trade in slaves was greatly reduced, however, it did notdisappear (see Jones 1983: 83–85; Kalous 1974: 185–186; Wylie 1977: 83–84).6 In 1954, the chiefs’ persistent ‘eating’ of their chiefdoms gave rise to ‘Disturbances’ inthe form of an uprising of youth in the Northern Province (Dorjahn 1960: 111, 139).7 See, e.g., Kalous 1974: 13, 32, 55–56, 78, 82, 85, 88, 89, 102, 107, 118, 121, 133,139, 161, and 277.8 See also Kalous 1974: 60, 67, 83, 129, 130, 133–137, 141–142, 148, 161–172.9 Raiders did not, of course, bite captives on their genitals. They did, however,‘mutilate’ the reproductive capacity of the families whose young people they stole bysevering them from their next generation.10 October 1989, Petbana Masimbo.11 Some accusations were, in fact, made by chiefs and big men against domestic slaves(Kalous 1974: 63, 89). Yet such accusations tended to rebound upon the accusers(Kalous 1974: 91).12 This raises the question of how many of the accusations and confessions in thecolonial records are dream narratives (cf. Baum 1983).13 One such rumour that circulated in 1999 (the year of the Lome Peace Accord)described Foday Sankoh, the leader of the RUF rebels, as having presided over thesacrifice and consumption of several albinos, together with several black cows, inorder to ensure that the rebels would remain rebels forever.

What ismore, Ukor and his colleagues at thePost Express Wiredwant this global audienceto know that such transformations are not ‘traditional’ in a simple sense but areas much a part of their fractured experience of modernity as is their ability toreach both national and transnational readers. Indeed, the general theme ofUkor’s editorial is that modern Nigeria has become a place of ‘horrifyingrealities’, where people are daily outraged by events and practices unheard of inthe precolonial period. The unsettling quality of Nigerian life at the beginningof the twenty-first century is marked by a different attachment to material reality– whether through virtual relationships, mediated by the electronic press, orthrough signs of another virtuality on Nigerians’ home ground: the seemingubiquity of what evangelical Christians see as satanic witchcraft and magic inthe country’s teeming cityscapes. In this chapter, I will therefore consider threedifferent subgenres of Nigerian popular press narratives about magical modernity,seeking to understand why Nigerians mark their experiences of modernitydifferently from most westerners – if, indeed, they do.The first of these popular subgenres has to do with witchcraft and bodilytransformation within Nigerian cities. Narratives of bodily transformation, I willargue, speak to the sense of many urban Nigerians that the anonymity of city lifeand the rapid change inherent to city relationships have destabilized people’sunderstandings of space, place and even of personhood (cf. Watts 1996;Ashforth 1998, Chapter 10). This discussion of anonymity and social trans-formation is meant to be rather different from Benjamin’s (1969: 172) classiccharacterization of the flâneur– the man of leisure who masters and patrols thecrowded urban streets in search of sensations, but who transcends hissurroundings and is never transformed by them. Comparing Nigerian narrativesof bodily transformation with Benjamin’s ideas about metropolitan flâneurshiptherefore may tell us something significantly different in the experiences ofmodernity at different times and in different locations.Chapter 4Vulture men, campus cultists andteenaged witchesModern magics in Nigerianpopular mediaMisty L. Bastian"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"In the second set of narratives, I will examine the pervasive fear of ‘cultism’in Nigeria’s university system. Although Nigeria’s universities were once thepride of sub-Saharan Africa, they have – during an extended period of militaryrule – undergone a process of degeneration in terms of infrastructure, the qualityof teaching and the attitudes of young people who attend them. Stories aboutuniversity cults speak to a growing disenchantment with the empty promises oflate capitalism for Nigeria’s youth – as well as to the anxieties that adults feelabout the activities of educated but jobless, often prospectless, young men. Thesestories of violence within an academic setting demonstrate the liminal circum-stances not only of young men but of one of the supposed motors of modernityand ‘development’ within Nigeria, the educational system itself.Finally, I will discuss a subgenre of narratives about an arrivistecategory ofNigeria’s magical population: the teenaged (usually female) witch. In this section,media stories of young women who embrace witchcraft will be considered,demonstrating how witchcraft can be glamorized as a ‘profession’ for urbangirls, who are represented as having an inordinate amount of leisure as well as aninsatiable desire for the trappings of material success. This part of the chapterwill highlight the gendered nature of Nigerian modern magics, discussing theway young women are subjected – at least in the Nigerian imaginary – tocontrol and bodily discipline when they demonstrate a propensity to movebeyond normalized gender boundaries. It will also suggest that the claim ofwitchly powers may be one method for urban women to counter the control oftheir elders and the misogynist attitudes of their male peers.Important themes to be addressed throughout the chapter include urbanAfrican life at the beginning of the twenty-first century; expressions of alienation,desire and fragmented social relations in contemporary Nigeria; representationsof masculinity under conditions of late capitalism; the militarization of Nigeriansociety; and the continued development of Nigerian versions of modern westernsocial categories. By addressing these themes, the chapter will demonstrate howNigerian representations of witchcraft, modernity and development necessarilyspeak to the recent history of the Nigerian state and to the separate culturesthat inhabit it.Vulture men: human to animal transformationsin Nigeria’s citiesDuring my first field experience during the late 1980s, I often heard urbanlegends about mysterious transformations in places like Lagos and Onitsha, thesoutheastern Nigerian city where I was working. Such stories began with anormal animal witnessed performing abnormal feats, whether walking on twolegs, speaking or appearing suddenly in an unusual location. When people whosaw this phenomenon were moved to act, they invariably tried to attack theuncanny beast. If the animal was wounded or killed, there were two possibleconsequences. The first was that the uncanny being managed to escape or72 Misty L. Bastian"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"disappeared in magical fashion. The second was that the beast was immobilized,suddenly turning into a person known to onlookers. The denouement of the firstversion is that the same wounds were invariably found on some suspected personthe next morning – or that person was found dead in her (or, more rarely, his)bed, with wounds that corresponded exactly to those inflicted on the werebeast.In such narratives, city streets, or other public spaces, were peculiarly proneto infestation with uncanny fauna, and urban spaces at night were most oftenthe sites for hybrid, human-bestial behaviour. People reported such sightings tome both as first-hand observations (much like that of Mr Ukor above) and aschoice market gossip. A few urban sceptics considered these only to be talesfrom the more credulous or ‘illiterate’ of their countrymen. However, most peoplewho related such narratives were sure of the stories’ veracity, pointing to specifici-ties in the tales in order to legitimate their truth-quality. Such specificities,however, are the hallmarks of the urban legend, combined as it often is inNigeria (or throughout the west) with a more vague sense of when this eventtook place and who, exactly, was present to corroborate it.Stories about animals with human characteristics have long had their placein southern Nigerian folklore (cf. Amadi 1982: 22). Wily snake-men who seducebeautiful but arrogant maidens, as well as witches who fly about as nocturnal birds,looking to cause harm to ordinary people, are staples of both Igbo and Yorubafolktales.1However, in most of the standard folkloric narratives about tricksteranimals or creatures out of category, the uncanny beasts work their magicaltransformations in the forest. This is a place where human beings are at a distinctdisadvantage, but where animals and other wild spirits are at home.In contemporary Nigeria, as in other parts of the world, urban dwellers have amore fraught relationship, not only with animals in the forest, but with thecountryside more generally (cf. Bastian 1993). Nonetheless, this estrangementbetween country and city would seem to have produced, within the storiescirculating throughout Nigeria’s cityscapes about human-animal transform-ations, a displacement of forest magic into the very centres of town. But is thisreally as ironic as it might appear, or could there be an internal logic to forest-based tricksters taking on urban dress and performing their magics in spaces thatwould seem antithetical to them? To answer this question, we will examine one,more recent story from the Nigerian electronic media, that of the ‘vulture man’of Port Harcourt (Brown 1999).During late August 1999, rumours circulated in the southeastern coastal citythat a child had knocked down a flying vulture that subsequently transformedinto a man. Adebayo Brown, a reporter for the Post Express Wired, tells us thatpolice were called in when a group of people encircled the ‘vulture man’,intending to kill him. The man was hospitalized because of the beating hesustained before the police could break up the ‘angry mob action’, remaining inprotective custody a week after the event. The man’s transformation into avulture was taken seriously not only by those passers-by who claimed to be itswitness but by the local media. Some reporters went so far as to question theModern magics in Nigerian popular media 73"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Rivers State Commissioner of Police, A. J. Peters, if the prisoner had attemptedany further animal transformations while in custody (Brown 1999). Peters thenscolded journalists at a press conference for seeking out sensational stories ‘forsale of newspapers, and entertainment on television’, and averred that thesupposed vulture man was actually of ‘unsound mind’.Whatever the official position of the Port Harcourt police’s Swift OperationsSquad, however, people in town were less sure about the vulture man – andremained interested in him and his fate. It was not that vulture men, or otherhuman-animal hybrids, were perceived as so rare in Nigerian cities, but that thecapture of a living specimen and its preservation by the police offered muchfood for thought. Madness is understood both as a medical and a spiritualcondition in contemporary Nigeria. Psychiatric hospitals and ‘herbal homes’, asthe shrines of healer-diviners are often known, have long histories and notalways separate adherents among Nigeria’s urban populations. While southernNigerians have their own symptomologies of madness, including seeing animalsthat no one else can see (Sadowsky 1999: 14, 88), southerners do not considerpeople caught performing an animal–human transformation to be mad. Thereare other categories for those capable of such a feat: witches, members of secretsocieties and elders with special powers, gained from connections to powerfulmedicines.It would be difficult to say which of these categories of person causes the mostanxiety among urban dwellers. Witches, as noted above, become animals whenon their nightly errands – carrying out their murderous plans disguised aspredators. Members of contemporary secret societies are thought to take on theanimal forms of the societies’ forest patrons, including vultures, civet cats andleopards. In the Port Harcourt area, for instance, leopards are historicallyassociated with the Ekpe/Ekposecret societies that once punished Igbo andIbibio people who transgressed local prohibitions (Offiong 1991: 2, 62–63).Early twentieth-century colonial reports are also rife with popular rumourshaving to do with ‘leopard men’ who terrorized both ‘natives’ and colonialofficials alike.2Elders, whose persons have been medicated by magical practi-tioners, are often viewed in the modern urban context as regressive agents ofrural power, and their appearance in towns is a cause for unease among WestAfrican city dwellers (cf. Bastian 1993; Geschiere and Nyamnjoh 1998).Vultures, however, have been positively valued in Ibibio religious practice, asthey were once considered to be representatives and sometimes even incarnationsof ancestral forces (Talbot 1967 [1923]: 173–174). Their appearance at rituals ofsacrifice was absolutely required; any sacrifice that did not draw the carrion birdswas considered unsuccessful. Among southern Igbo-speakers (another significantpart of the Port Harcourt population), vultures have both positive and negativesymbolic associations. As scavengers of the marketplace, they are considered‘useful’ animals – beings who help to keep the market clean and beautiful(Bastian forthcoming a). Conversely, the birds are perceived to be polluted andpolluting because they eat the kills of other animals. This view is conducive to74 Misty L. Bastian"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"the worst Igbo ‘reading’ of vultures as cannibal beings who live off the bodies ofthe more productive or less fortunate. Such readings can help to explain whythe notion of a ‘vulture man’ flying over the skies of Port Harcourt would beboth so fascinating and repellent to urbanites. The idea of ancestors manifestingthemselves as vultures might also take on a more problematic status if weconsider how ill-prepared to face ancestral forces, or any other powers connectedwith older modes of rural life, most urban dwellers feel themselves to be.3In southern Nigerian discourse the spiritual forces of the forest have neverconfined themselves strictly to the wild, but always seek to infiltrate civilizedhuman spaces. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Nigeria’s urbanareas are not so privileged by global modernity that they can claim immunityfrom this infiltration. If anything, the modern cityscape offers new avenues for thecreativity of the forest and its denizens. Where people living in even a relativelypopulous village-group can be familiar, at least by sight, to most of theirneighbours, the Nigerian urbanite is mobile, less rooted and finds it more difficultto know those who live and work in close proximity. Other city dwellers’ personalhistories are a mystery, only to be learned by dint of great effort, and intimateconnections have to be made. They cannot be taken for granted. The sheernumbers of people around the urbanite makes it impossible for him or her to feelsecure about the motivations and interests of others. Strangers do not, as in therural areas, come from outside. They live next door or even in the next room.Vulture men therefore need not find an excuse for their presence; thebuildings and complex, badly marked streets are as good a cover as the trees of thesubtropical forest once were. The cities and their suburban satellites indeedhave replaced many of the old, forested areas of southern Nigeria, opening upspace only in one sense. The loss of the trees and underbrush did not, in theimaginary of southeasterners, necessarily mean the loss of spiritual entities thatonce made these areas their home.4Instead of becoming disenchanted, Nigeria’scities have taken on a modern magic: with forest creatures reinventing them-selves as entrepreneurs and fashion victims, the better to snare their old prey,human beings.What is more disturbing to southern Nigerians than the notion that theircities are homes to such creatures is that the state is implicated in the animal-human hybrids’ plots and machinations. In 1980s urban legends about humananimals, after all, the best solution offered to the paradox of hybridity wasxenocide, but in Brown's report the ‘vulture man’ was not destroyed by mobaction because the police protected him. This is probably one reason why thestory received such extensive coverage in the local and electronic press. ManyNigerians distrust the officials who supposedly protect them, but who requireexpensive bribes to do the minimum for ordinary citizens – and, indeed, mightbe seen as bureaucratic vultures, picking over the barely-breathing body ofNigerian civil society.If magic is valuable to the modern West African state – and we have manyreasons to believe it is (Shaw 1996; Geschiere 1997; Meyer 1998) – then it isModern magics in Nigerian popular media 75"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"understandable why Port Harcourt inhabitants and members of the Nigerianpress might find it suspicious that state functionaries were so eager to characterizethe ‘vulture man’ as mad.5The mixture of magic and the state makes regularNigerians anxious, because they know that there is political currency in theoccult – whether that currency is imaginary or not (Comaroff and Comaroff1999). As we will see in the next section on ‘campus cultists’, even the mostfantastic of conspiratorial ideas can become too painfully real in a society wheremodernity’s most basic promises are subverted. Vulture men may be good tothink with – a part of the nation’s consideration of what modern cities mean –but cults and secret societies on the nation’s campuses speak to the unthinkable:the potential breakdown of all modern civility, at the very moment of itsgestation.‘Spilling blood all in the name of brotherhood’: campus cultists,or gangsters in the ivory tower?We have always wanted to be tough, to be feared and obeyed.

Each of us used to belong to some fraternity until it became clearthat independence was inevitable. We were not at home with some of theirmodus operandi.

There’s a finality to that word, and dirty jobs get done in a cleanway – no mess ups. We could not understand why the other members werereluctant to move with the times.Of course there would always be cults. They used to belong to youthsfrom poor backgrounds – as a way to combat the oppressions by the rich. Notanymore. Some of us are from very wealthy homes.

Bastian"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"During the 1960s, the first full generation of educated Nigerian youth wereable to attend university in their own country (Crowder 1973: 305–388;Zachernuk 2000: 128–129). The immediate post-independence period was aheady time for the universities, and there was great optimism about Nigeria’sfuture as a ‘developed’ country, one of the ‘giants’ of contemporary Africa and aleader in the non-aligned movement of so-called Third World states.6Universities – first in the southwestern region of Nigeria, then in both the northand the southeast – were thought to be the motors for the new nation’sinevitable prosperity. Education more generally was celebrated as the sovereignmeans for social transformation and the spread of development and modern-ization ideologies – what Ferguson (1999: 13–14) calls the ‘modernization myth’– throughout the population (cf. Escobar 1995: 45). The last thing that wasexpected by those who contemplated the burgeoning Nigerian university systemat its inception was that universities would become notorious hotbeds for whatpartisans of modernization would stigmatize as ‘superstition’.7Certainly no oneimagined the resurgence of violent, masculinist rituals within the universities,syncretic of local and foreign men’s associations.What Nigerians now refer to as ‘campus cultism’ began during the 1950s,when nationalist fervour was at its height. Some even point to Nobel LaureateWole Soyinka as the founder of the early fraternity movement (Nzediegwu1999).8Soyinka’s Pyrate Confraternity at the University College of Ibadanwas one of the first such associations, and its membership constituted a latecolonial, intellectual elite who would go on to work in international scholarlycircles as well as in Nigerian journalism and politics (cf. Zachernuk 2000:135–138). The point of the Pyrate fraternity was conviviality and, quotingeditorialist Emmanuel Nzediegwu (1999), ‘to put pressure on the colonialists,shake off colonial mentality, assert the identity of true independence and toinstil university culture into members’. Although Soyinka and his colleaguestook as their mascot the bloodthirsty pirate, the playful spelling of theirorganization’s name gives a good sense of the style of the fraternity. SophisticatedEnglish verbal games were of far greater interest than mayhem, although serioustopics were discussed by the fraternity members who understood themselves tobe in preparation for political and social independence from the British.The best-educated sons of Nigeria’s (mostly southern) indigenous professionals,the Pyrates wished to be part of Nigeria’s future and did not model themselvesdirectly on institutions from what they considered very much the country’s past.There is no space in the present chapter to go into the contentious history ofNigerian intellectuals on the cusp of independence (see Zachernuk 2000), so allthat I will say here is that the Pyrates soon split apart under the pressure ofcompetition within the fraternity. Other groups formed as offshoots of theoriginal Pyrates, and yet more fraternities developed along with the expansionof the university system throughout the tumultuous civil war period of the 1960sand Nigeria’s Oil Boom in the 1970s. These fraternities seem to have remainedrelativelybenign and true to the intent of Soyinka and his peers, although theirModern magics in Nigerian popular media 77"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"names emphasized the more sensationalistic and violent aspects of transatlanticpopular culture: Buccaneers, Blood Suckers, Black Cat, Vikings Confraternity,Mafia, Red Devils, Black Berets, Green Berets, the Black Axes and the NeoBlack Movement among others (Nzediegwu 1999).Young Nigerian men who were the products of the university system duringits heyday maintained contact with each other after graduation and professionaltraining, much in keeping with the ties created by contemporary North Americanfraternities (Nuwer 1999). These now senior men also developed ties withyounger men who were involved in fraternity life on campus. They acted asmentors to their juniors and encouraged their male relations to take part inmasculine secret associations as an initiation into the modernizing rubrics of‘university culture’. However, college confraternities were no more immune tothe growing difficulties faced by Nigeria’s population in the era of extendedmilitary rule and Oil Bust (1980s–1990s) than were other Nigerian institutions.If anything, we might suggest that they were actually more sensitive than someorganizations of Nigeria’s increasingly ‘uncivil’ society, because their member-ship was particularly at risk in the climate of kleptocracy, brain drain andsystemic unemployment. Unlike the members of fraternities from the 1940sonwards, the ‘brothers’ of the 1980s and 1990s did not find their universitycoursework and degrees an automatic passport to well-paid positions in thegovernment bureaucracy or the ‘Nigerianized’ petrochemical industry. Indeed,young men during the latter two decades of the twentieth century wereeducated by a university system under severe strain.During the Oil Boom, as an attempt to appease any ethnic discontentremaining from the Biafran civil war, alternating Nigerian civilian and militaryregimes pursued a policy of establishing new, often underfunded universitiesthroughout the country. In the 1980s I heard these new universities referred toas ‘mushroom campuses’, because they had sprung up – in quite unlikelylocations – overnight. Unlike the older, established universities at Ibadan or Ile-Ife (now known as Obafemi Awolowo University), the mushroom campusessuffered from shoddy and sometimes inadequate construction, strained relationsbetween local faculties and outsider administrations, as well as ongoing financialcrises. Students attended overcrowded lectures, taught by postgraduate studentsand faculty members who no longer looked forward to regular paycheques, muchless to the subsidized housing and transport of Nigeria’s Oil Boom academe.University libraries contained mainly out-of-date publications, when books orjournals were to be had at all, and students could neither afford nor obtaintextbooks for their courses. During the late 1980s, student dormitories in thenew universities were regularly without electrical power and running water,while the student cuisine of necessity was dry gari(cassava) mixed with heatedwater and sugar – if the last two commodities were available.It was into this climate of scholarly and national deprivation that campusfraternities were reborn as campus cults. Whereas the original confraternitieswere elite organizations, the college male organizations of the 1970s onwards78 Misty L. Bastian"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"took on a different character. In the aftermath of universal primary educationprogrammes and expanded access to secondary schools (Falola 1996: 85–87,150), young men and women from less lofty social backgrounds were able to takeadvantage of the Oil Boom expansion of the university system, entering tertiaryeducation in ever-increasing numbers.9Male youth coming to the universities directly from rural areas and lessprivileged households may have seen the fraternity system as close kin to theage grades, men’s masquerade and other secret societies with which they werefamiliar. According to the anonymous (2000) features writer for SundayVanguardquoted at the beginning of this section, these young men, anxiousabout their future prospects and present, liminal class positions, bandedtogether in collegiate ‘cults’ in order ‘to combat the oppressions by the rich’.While class-based resistance may have motivated the formation of certaincounter-fraternities, by the late 1980s rumours abounded among educatedyoung people that elite undergraduates were taking over the leadership anddeveloping ‘gangs’ from among the disaffected male majority in the universities(cf. Bastian 1999).Whether gangs, cults or counter-fraternities, such groups were associated inthe minds of my youthful informants in the 1980s with the burgeoning drug andweapons trade in the southeast. This trade in illegal but highly lucrativecommodities was, among other things, considered by many to be a directconsequence of IMF structural adjustment requirements and the lengtheningshadow of military rule throughout Nigeria (Apter 1999). Nigerian media hasbeen sensitive to the possible connection between young university men’sincreasing violence in the past two decades and what one Post Express Wirededitorialist (Onunaiju 1999) calls ‘the militarisation of the country’s politicalprocess and the consequent de-intellectualisation of [its] university life’.Certainly it became clear to Nigeria’s intelligent male youth during the‘permanent transition’ from General Babangida’s military tricksterism (Apter1999) to General Abacha’s state of terror that weapons, brutal intimidation andillicit trade were the means to political and social power in the country. Civilianelections could be set aside, civilian candidates and their kin could be jailed orpermanently silenced by mysterious bombs or highway ambushes, and menclaiming to live on the salaries of the military command ranks could amassforeign bank accounts with balances numbering in the billions of US dollars.The lesson was sufficiently pointed, even for students whose classes wereconstantly cancelled because of faculty strikes or government shutdowns of theuniversities for ‘subversion’ and ‘indiscipline’.While the military regimes of the 1980s and 1990s suppressed universityactivism alongside the trade union and other socially conscious movements, allin the nameof national discipline, campus cults became more entrenched inuniversity life. Many civic-minded Nigerians began to join editorialist CharlesOnunaiju (1999) in his question: ‘Did [the military rulers] not prefer theproduction of thugs, to patriots who will raise questions about their rascalityModern magics in Nigerian popular media 79"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"with power?’ However, such questions could only be spoken in the most subduedtones under General Abacha, a military dictator who showed a propensity forthe parapolitical tactics of disappearance, torture and extra-judicial execution –all, not coincidentally, also the modus operandi of campus cultists. Campusthugs, some argued, were in training for their future roles in the military take-over of the Nigerian polity, and the most intimate familial connections betweenthe military and campus cult leaders were sometimes postulated, as in the anony-mous quote (2000) above.An important part of media and ordinary Nigerian discourse about campuscults during the last decades of the twentieth century was an understanding thatuniversity violence was carried out on several levels, including that of theoccult. Discussions of the fraternities invariably lead Nigerians to rumour aboutfraternity/cult initiations, which are thought to require physical violence andterror, often against women on campus,10as well as ‘medicines’, other powerobjects, and even the standard ritual accoutrements of European Masonry orSatanism. Once initiated, university cult members were (and are) believed tohave a supernatural immunity to gunshot wounds, to possess a superhumansexual potency and appetite and to have a magical ability to influence the mindsof others (Iloduba 1999). In the latter case, members are supposedly able to usewhat appear to be ordinary, everyday objects like handkerchiefs or cigarettes tobewitch people and force them to do the cults’ bidding (cf. Bastian 1992, 1998).Rumours about campus occultism are directly tied to ideas about the magicalactivities of Nigerian politicians, military and businessmen. Cult violence at theuniversities does not occur only in the Nigerian imaginary, but has explodedinto an all too real epidemic of rape, physical (as well as psychological) woundsand death on campus during the past decade. Such violence is perceived bymany Nigerians to be determined by the more generally violent environment ofthe country.11Cultism therefore reflects forms of violence already present insociety, but it also perpetuates and even creates an escalating environment ofimmorality, carrying that immorality and its material consequences into thenext generations.When cult members leave the campus, they are rumoured to have twotrajectories. If of an upper-class background, young cultists go into elite secretsocieties like the Reformed Ogboni Fraternity. This is a Yoruba-based group thatnow boasts a membership crossing all ethnic boundaries and is said to be behindthe ascent of many Nigerians into the higher echelons of government admin-istration, the judiciary and multinational corporations (cf. Agbroko 1996).Although once an elders’ society, limited to the Yoruba-speaking areas of thecountry and meant to act in the capacity of moral guardianship for thecommunity, including the obaor king (Amadi 1982: 9–10; Apter 1992: 83, 90;Matory 1994: 265, n. 16), the Reformed Ogboni Fraternity is now considered –at least by those who do not belong to the organization – to be at the bottom ofNigeria’s most entangled conspiracies.Ogboni members I knew in the late 1980s, however, denied involvement in80 Misty L. Bastian"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"national conspiracy and told me that their group was really meant for elitenetworking and socializing. They were uniformly proud of their membership,but would only hint at the rigours of their initiation and investiture intoOgboni, mainly suggesting it was, in the English words of one member, ‘costly,very costly’. The continuing costs of Ogboni membership are an issue of greatinterest and anxiety among ordinary Nigerians today, particularly evangelicalChristians. Stigmatized by Christian leaders as ‘public sinners . . . who cannot be[members] of the body of Christ’ (Esele 1996), there has been a growing sensethat Ogboni, Freemasons and other secret societies mean ill for their fellowhuman beings. Just as campus cultists are sometimes rumoured to sacrificehuman beings (or parts of their own bodies; cf. Anonymous 1999), there is aconflation in Nigerian conspiratorial imaginaries between groups like theReformed Ogboni Fraternity and the supposedly wealthy practitioners of ‘satanicacts’ or juju(Iloduba 1999).Graduates of lower social background have little hope of immediate entranceinto Nigerian secret societies like the Ogboni. Unlike the children of Ogbonimembers, lower class ex-cultists without connections may seek patronage from‘big men’ in their home areas or may trade upon associations begun with elitegraduates from their universities. Some consider the recent explosion of armedrobbery within the southern half of Nigeria to be directly connected to thenumbers of ex-cultists who have weapons, ruthless patrons as well as theexperience of university brutality behind them (Emeh 1997). Unemployed aftergraduation and with few prospects, since their university degrees (if granted)now offer little in the way of social mobility, lower class ex-cultists have veryfew other options. They may enlist in the military and expect to serve as‘peacekeepers’ in African locations of civil strife like Sierra Leone, where thetemptation to take part in the violent corruption associated with the illicitdiamond and weapons trade is great.12They may try to return to theirimpoverished hometowns, where there will be an equally great temptation touse campus cultist skills – including mystical skills – to become more importantpersonages among their peers. The result of this latter prospect may be seen inthe spate of kidnappings for money and disappearances of children, possibly foruse in ‘ritual murder’, in the city of Owerri during the mid-1990s (Bastian 1999;Smith forthcoming).Equipped by their college cult education, not for continued modernization orthe development of civil society in Nigeria, but to shore up the nation’skleptocratic elite, some young men are moving into what we might callpostgraduate violence. What they have learned is pertinent to the Nigerianversion of modernity that stresses the importance of (para)militarized power andterror and contributes to the material andspiritual insecurity (Ashforth 1998,Chapter 10) of everyday life in contemporary Nigeria. In a haze of hyper-masculinity and without much sense of any future worth considering, ex-cultistsleave the campus but not the cult behind, and it is not only the universities butNigerian society as a whole that suffers for it.Modern magics in Nigerian popular media 81"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"(Teen) witches invade Nigeria: young women inmagical modernityMy name is Augustina Uzora from Imo State.

Bastian 1997,forthcoming c) infesting Lagos, the country’s former capital. Complete withphotographs of the confessing ogbaanje speaking into microphones and holdingup evangelical literature, it is apparent that these are youthful, well-dressed andlovely women, hardly the stereotype of aged, powerless women often seen as thevictims par excellenceof African mystical accusations (see Figures 4.1 and 4.2).13These young women areconfessing – under the pressure of a new fashion, ‘bornagain’ Christianity – to the interference with physical and social reproductionoften associated with witchcraft and other mystical acts on the continent(Austen 1993). However, as in the example above, they are confessing to apeculiarly modern conflation of overwhelming sexuality and reproductiveblockage rather than to the antisexual powers and supposed jealousies of age.Augustina Uzora, self-confessed ogbaanje and ‘agent of satan’ as quoted above,claims five ‘powers’, all lodged at various sites in her body.14These powers havebeen given to Uzora by her ‘spiritual husband’ – which in the present caseprobably means the ambigendered spiritual force known as Mami Wata (Bastian1997) – and they are used to ensnare, then destroy, men. The mode of thisdestruction is made clearer by Uzora’s sister ogbaanje, Georgina Nwokwa (Figure4.3): ‘I don’t go for poor guys. I go for rich men. Anytime I have fun with them,their business will start collapsing. Even if he is very wealthy, the man will starthaving problems’. Uzora claims that the power resident in her vagina ‘disturbs’her when she sees such a successful man. It is as though her dangerous sexualitycalls out, not for satisfaction, but for revenge. Once she and Nwokwa ‘have fun’with their male victims, the men are no longer rich and their families are‘wrecked’. In the more explicit words of another confessing ogbaanje, NgoziNwosu (Figure 4.4), who proclaims herself ‘the queen of the coast, a Cobra’:82 Misty L. Bastian"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"‘The power in my vagina is the one I use to destroy men[.] I destroy their spermso that they will become impotent and their business will not prosper. I’ll justmake them useless’.Although Uzora seems to wish to lose her powers, and to have come to theSynagogue Church for just this purpose, she also appears to be proud of thosepowers. There is a sense in her brief confession that she has taken charge of alife that otherwise was intolerable, a life where, among other things, she wasbeaten by male relatives because of her ‘stubbornness’. As is common with theconfessions of other ogbaanje in the Conscience Internationalarticle, Uzora firstboasts about what she can do with her powerful body, then submits it to theministrations of Pastor T.B. Joshua for exorcism. To understand better theconfessions (and Christian submission) of these youthful Nigerian women, weneed to discuss the more general situation of young women in the country –particularly their gendered experiences of modern social life.As I have argued elsewhere (Bastian 2000; forthcoming b), not only genderbut youth is a constructed category in contemporary Nigeria, with a historydirectly connected to European colonial and mission incursions.

Mission education played a key part in theconstruction of a protracted ‘girlhood’ or female adolescence during whichyoung, colonial women could be kept from marriage and (their own) house-keeping in order to become modern, Christian and female subjects. An unin-tended consequence of these educational activities, however, was that – asyoung Nigerian women developed these looked-for, modern Christian sub-jectivities – they also developed an interest in personal, individuated advance-ment. Young women necessarily imbibed some of the rubrics of secularism alongwith their modern studies, especially once some of them could read in Englishand discovered genres of literature that were not first approved by the mis-sionaries. Formal literacy was hardly the only means for young women to learnmodernity, however.New, embodied disciplines of dress and hygiene were forced upon missionizedwomen in the colonial period; once tested, these same disciplines were activelyembraced by Nigerian women everywhere. Young women in particular wereencouraged by missionaries to adopt what the Europeans thought of as modestdress, ‘frocks’ constructed on sewing machines. In adopting European-stylefashion, youthful Nigerian women also learned the new fashion technology as a84 Misty L.

Colonial notions of hygiene were frequently directed towardsAfrican women’s sexuality and its social consequences (cf. Schmidt 1992; Shaw1995; Hunt 1999; Bastian 2001). Women in the mission schools of southernNigeria were taught not only to cover their bodies but to wash, groom andotherwise maintain their body boundaries to minimal European standards.Again Nigerian women were required to engage in wider patterns of consumption,including the purchase of imported soaps, pomades, lotions, combs and otherproducts meant to ‘civilize’ their African, unruly and sexual bodies, bringingthem more in line with the European feminine norm (cf. Burke 1996 for asimilar process in Northern Rhodesia).Not all southern Nigerian women, of course, wholeheartedly embracedcolonial and mission projects during the twentieth century. Some women –notably those based in rural communities – actively resisted colonial incursion(Bastian forthcoming a, 2001), including western commodities and practices ofconsumption. Women living in the colony’s urban areas were more implicatedin the first wave of missionization, and it was urban life in Nigeria, as in Europeor North America, that gave greater scope for women’s attachment to modernproducts and the ideas embedded in them. Young women began to live outsidelineage compounds and control, acting as an important part of the moneyeconomy within southern Nigerian towns as early as the 1920s. They alsodeveloped relatively independent social lives through contacts made amongneighbours and co-workers in the urban areas, social lives that included sexualitynot always tied to marriage. When marriage did concern this emerging class ofyoung, female, colonized moderns, it was often couched in Christian, mono-gamous terms – at exactly the same time that mission-educated, male nationalistswere beginning to question monogamy as anti-African.15By the independence period, young southern Nigerian women were flockingto the cities. Along with this more educated, although less affluent (in relationto their male counterparts) population came an increased commodification ofurban women’s sexuality, not only through prostitution but through less profes-sional interactions. Women were said to trade sexual favours for kind as well ascash. Urban men, also living away from their lineage bases in the rural areas,were both without their accustomed modes of domesticity and suddenly aware ofthe sheer numbers of sexual partners possible.16Men had greater access toemployment and commodities, particularly as they were offered opportunitiesin the new, state-run industries, military or government bureaucracy. There-fore they found that women were sexually available in the city without thecommitment of (or public scrutiny associated with) marriage.Women in the cities of independent Nigeria suffered from less consistentemployment and education, although they continued to make significant gainsin both. Indeed, contemporary Nigeria can boast of prominent women in allsectors of government, education and business. Nonetheless, these elite womenconstitute only a small minority of the overall Nigerian female, urbanModern magics in Nigerian popular media 85"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"population – and their achievements are not always seen positively. In southernsocieties, powerful, important women have long been stigmatized as witches,whose nightly, covert meetings take place at the tops of trees (Henderson 1969:301; Apter 1992: 113).17Such witches, like the vulture man (pp. 73–76), aresaid to transform themselves into nocturnal birds, and they are associated withpsychic cannibalism and blocked lineage reproduction. However, night birdsmay also promote the general wealth of a town, and the witches’ society –sometimes amusingly and tellingly called ‘the Air Force’ in present-day Nigeria– may offer a protective power against outsiders.The sexuality of elder witches is suspect, mainly in that it is exercised to thedetriment of patrilineage fertility. Contemporary urban ‘sugar mummies’ areconsidered probable candidates for membership in the occult Air Force. Theykeep youthful, virile men from mates of their own age and class and arerumoured to generate their continuing beauty and seemingly bottomless bankaccounts from sexual rituals performed with these youths. While such womenare chastised in popular discourse (including the print media; e.g. Kebby 1988),their behaviour is often represented in indulgent, even patronizing tones. Themanners and mores of older women, especially those beyond the years of child-bearing, do not seem to threaten patriarchal social structures deeply. Indeed,menopausal women in Nigerian cities who accumulate money, lovers and powermay even shore up patriarchal relations in that they emulate the careertrajectory of elite men, but are not in serious competition with male elders forresources or status.18The rise of youthful women with rumoured sexual and mystical sway overolder, successful men, however, is perceived to be more of a problem for mascu-linist urban Nigeria. These young women are portrayed in media and rumour asnubile, bored and rapacious – but also as canny and not only willing, but able, totrick men into doing their bidding. Self-absorbed and secure in their sexualpotency, able to support themselves through the commodification of their bodiesor alliances with the wild spiritual forces that, as we have seen, are believed toroam city streets, youthful witches (or ogbaanje) offer a new threat to the statusquo. An urban legend recently collected in Nigeria speaks interestingly to men’sconcerns about mobile, modern and beauty-obsessed female youth:There is a story going around Lagos that illustrates the lethal cocktailproduced when ignorance and superstition are combined with poverty. Itbegins with the driver of a motorcycle taxi, called an Okada, who picked upa female passenger one day and handed her a helmet. The helmet is the firstclue that this is not your usual Okada story. No one in Lagos, Nigeria’slargest city, wears a helmet while riding a motorcycle.The passenger didn’t put on the helmet; she wanted to protect herhairstyle. She placed the helmet on the head of the driver instead. Nosooner had she done this than he vanished and the motorcycle crashed.Drivers swarmed around. Someone recognised the driver’s bike, but his86 Misty L. Bastian"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"body was nowhere to be found. A group went to his house to break thenews to his family.There, they found the driver, stretched out on his bed, in a zombie-likestate. And from the mouth of this zombie came money, more money thanany of them had ever seen before.(Drohan 2000)The bald, western newspaper account only hints at the richness of the originalstory, told to me by Canadian journalist Madelaine Drohan, recently returnedfrom a month’s visit to Nigeria.19In the oral version of the narrative, I had asense of the beautiful, richly dressed young passenger, her hair just relaxed andswept up in the latest fashion; of her indecision about what to do with theunaccustomed helmet, and the speed with which she and the mysterious Okadadriver darted in and out of Lagos’s notorious ‘go-slows’ (traffic jams). There wasalso the denouement of the young woman’s decision to jam the helmet down onher driver’s head, told as if in slow-motion: the motorcycle going out of control,and the passenger thrown onto the street, rising to look for the missing driver,unable to believe the evidence of her eyes. Finally the tale was replete withvignettes of other Okada taximen, looking for their colleague along the street,recognizing his bike and demanding that the young woman accompany them tothe driver’s home as surety that she had not stolen the valuable vehicle andcome to grief on it. There, after forcing their way into the driver’s house, all eyeswere met with the final horror: the dead but animate body stretched out on thebed, money pouring out of its mouth in streams. All realized immediately thatthis was to be the fate of the young woman herself – and understood that thiswas probably not the first body to lie helpless on the bed, vomiting out its life’sproductivity (or, as local people say, ‘making money the easy way’ for its mysticalowner; cf. Bastian 1992; Masquelier 2000).Besides being one of a vast array of West African urban legends about juju,this tale clearly represents the futility some men feel about gaining access to andcontrolling the sexuality of young women in the cities. The Okada taxidriver isa stock villain of modern Nigerian magic: he is a money magician, preying onthe unwary and their need for cheap, rapid transport through Lagos streets,disguised as an honest, even humble entrepreneur. The promise of speed andefficiency, elusive commodities in the land of the ‘go-slows’, is a ruse to lureyoung women under the medicated helmet. With their powerful heads imprisonedand vision obscured, the women disappear off the liminal space of the road andreappear suggestively, without consciousness or volition, on the magician’s bed –where their valuable (and already commodified?) bodies produce the cash that amotorcycle taxidriver would otherwise never earn.What is new about this story is that the young woman inadvertently foils hermystical assailant through her vanity. She appears the perfect victim; she isyoung, beautiful and alone on the Lagos streets. She is more aware of hercostume and personal grooming than of the potential danger of her surroundings.Modern magics in Nigerian popular media 87"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"But it is this self-absorption that saves her: rather than give herself ‘hat hair’after all the time and money that has gone into her coiffeur, the young womanimpatiently puts the helmet on the driver’s head, sending him to the fate he hadreserved for her. The money magician does not control her body; she controlshis. The passenger renders her driver (a businessman of sorts) as ‘useless’ asNgozi Nwosu, above, makes her unwary sexual partners.To some extent outside of patriarchal boundaries, refusing or unwilling tosubmit to masculine authority, able to use the power of their abundant sexualityfor their own purposes, ‘stubborn’ or simply clueless, the young women who takeon occult powers in early twenty-first century Nigerian social imaginarieschallenge male verities. This does not mean that these young witches andogbaanje are conscious, resisting agents of Nigerian feminism. The ogbaanjewho have reportedly ‘destroyed’ 4,000 Nigerian men have come to the male-dominated church of Pastor T.B. Joshua to try his prophetic powers (and, in thecase of the queen of the coast, to try his chastity) and have been defeatedthrough prayer, Christian faith and holy water. Their sexual potency andmagical alliances end at the door of the Synagogue Church, where they areforced to submit to an unabashedly masculinist interrogation and to part withthe forces that once animated their powerful, young bodies. The young womanwho thwarts the money magician can never feel as safe on the streets of her city,nor as ready to ignore the world’s dangers in favour of her own beauty. Thatmirror is smashed forever by her new-found knowledge of the extent to whichsome men will go to dominate and commodify her very existence.Women’s modern magics, while feared, are thus ultimately tamed in theNigerian imaginary and brought under the surveillance and control of senior,masculine forces. Overwhelming sexuality and satanic avarice in these narrativesinvariably are drawn and yield to the power of evangelical Christianity. Youngwomen with too much leisure, interest in consumption and mobility become theprey of money magicians. In both cases, women’s embodied pleasures must beyielded up or there is a threat that their lives (mortal or immortal) will be takenfrom them by the very powers they embrace. Whether renouncing Satan orlearning to be afraid of public transportation, the teenaged witch is put solidlyback into her place in these narratives: that of the properly fertile, properlysubmissive, no longer magical girl. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has not yet come toNigeria, although her hereditary enemies are well entrenched.ConclusionsNigeria’s populous cityscapes resonate with many forces, for good or ill. Some ofthose forces westerners would immediately recognize as indicative of urbanmodernity (cf. Williams 1973; Giddens 1990; Miller 1994; Felski 1995; Appadurai1996; Hall et al. 1996). Nigerians are quite familiar with free-wheeling, globalizedcapitalist commerce and consumption, social, individual and physical mobility,agencies of state-level surveillance and control, belief in and reliance on abstract88 Misty L. Bastian"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"systems, the proliferation of technologies, the sometimes pleasurable, sometimesterrifying anonymity of city life, criminals, deviants, madmen and proponents ofradical dissent, and an avant-garde of artists and other culture brokers whopropel socially creative innovations. But is the modernity of Lagos exactly thesame as that of New York or London? Can people’s experience of being modernever be homogeneous, when their histories, societies and basic cosmologicalunderstandings are not the same? Indeed, should we call the experiences ofthose outside the western world ‘modern’ at all?Naturally I pose these questions in full awareness of an emerging critique ofthe ethnography of modernity (Englund 1996; Appadurai 1996; Hannerz 1996;Englund and Leach 2000; Ferguson 1999) and agree with some of its premises –notably the necessary centrality of the ethnographic method, even when oneworks from textual materials as I do here. I also see a good deal of sense inHannerz’s (1996: 51) representation of the ‘metaculture’ of similarity: in whichwestern theorists constantly seek to homogenize the world in order better tocategorize and understand it. However, I take issue with critics Englund and Leachwhen they suggest that all ethnographic work on modernity, or multiplemodernities, ‘represent[s] variation against something that is invariable’ (2000:228, their italics). The laundry list of urban modernity above is just that: apartial accounting of the social garments available. Western (and westernized)societies may well experience all of the rubrics above and understand them, inpart, to constitute ‘modernity’, but it is their particular, historically specific com-binations with other, equally valid and important social experiences that give agroup its own, modern identity. Such lists are necessarily incomplete, situationaland contextual, just as I would posit southern Nigerian understandings of whatit means to be modern to be. Variation is thus at the heart of modernity, even ifobscured by what philosopher of technology Andrew Feenberg (1995: 221) callsthe ‘necessary illusion’ of reason’s autonomy in modern systems.20As we have seen in this chapter, Nigerian urban experiences of modernitymay include a sense that rural-based elders have access to transformativeabilities that can threaten the well-being of their city kin and even strangers, orthat cities themselves maintain a cosmographic continuity with the forestedareas they have displaced physically but not conceptually. Supposed ‘motors’ ofmodernization and development, like the university system, may harbourorganizations that are both ‘modern’ in their use of the technologies ofdestruction and ‘retrograde’ in their insistence on the extremes of male solidarityand dominance. Secret societies may flourish at the same time a nation-stateembraces the rhetoric of civil society and official transparency. Young women –whose social status has, perhaps, been the most changed over the course ofNigeria’s tumultuous twentieth century – are expected to be gendered consumerspar excellencebut also to rein in their problematic sexuality and desire forpersonal agency, both of which can be connected to the history of colonialcommodities and ideas.

See, for instance,Gottlieb 1992: 98–115 for Beng folklore relating to clairvoyant dogs and the highlyambiguous hyena. The Mande epic corpus also includes a number of tales having todo with transforming animals or human-animal hybrids. See Niane 1965, Bird 1972,Austen 1999, Conrad 1999 and Johnson 1999. Willis (1975) gives a number ofstories about the supposed spirit connection to various beasts in Eastern Africa anddiscusses the important problem of human-animal classificatory systems inanthropological thought more generally.2 Cf. Talbot 1967 [1923]: 88 for Ibibio notions of ‘were-beasts,’ Hives 1940 [1930]:69–70 on the transformative abilities of Aro Igbo, as well as Butt-Thompson 1970[1929] for a similar set of stories in colonial Sierra Leone. More recently, historianNancy Rose Hunt (1999: 30) notes that the nearby Congo was considered – at leastby colonialists – to be ‘a...world of leopard-men and crocodile-men’ during the1930s.3 Smith (forthcoming) also provides a story of evil vulture transformations in theOwerri Igbo area, just to the north of Port Harcourt. His understanding of the symbolicnature of vultures is clearly coloured by the negative ‘reading’ of vulture behaviour.4 In neighbouring Niger, spirits from the bush are said not only to follow the unwaryinto the town (Masquelier 1999: 37) but to transform themselves into automobiles orother vehicles and attempt to murder people who stray onto rural roads at night(Masquelier 1992: 57).5 Nigerian media writers are well aware of the importance of the occult for WestAfrican and, indeed, for international political economy. As Mma Agbagha (1997)noted in his Post Express Wirededitorial on the subject: ‘Today in several embattledAfrican countries [Agbagha is being circumspect in the face of the Nigerian militaryregime], it is the soothsayer that has the last word in the formulation and implemen-tation of policy, both personal and national, as far as the leader is concerned. Andlike the case of Macbeth, these fortune-tellers worm their way into the heart of theleader through initial self-fulfilling prophesies. Thereafter, the leader of a whole nationis at their mercy.’6 A textual sample of this early, educated enthusiasm for Nigeria and its potential canbe found in Sam Epelle’s (1960) The Promise of Nigeria, published in the UnitedKingdom as informative propaganda for the new state.

However, see Ihonvbere and Shaw (1998: 144–147) for a critique ofNigerian intellectual conservatism and retreat to the ‘ivory tower,’ even in the periodof the 1960s.7 A moving testimonial to the optimism, nationalist fervour and modernizationorientation of students during this period can be found in Amuta (1999): ‘Now atmid-life, I can look back at those years [in college at the University of Ile-Ife, nowObafemi Awolowo] with a certain degree of nostalgia as, perhaps, the years ofgreatest hope and optimism for my generation. It was an optimism in the power ofknowledge to transform reality. We literally charged at knowledge as the only tool forchanging our society and transforming our individual lives.’ Amuta’s sense of outrageat a spate of campus cult-related executions at Obafemi Awolowo University during1999, he tells us, is all the sharper because of the expectations he took away from hissojourn there.8 Professor Ogbu Kalu (personal communication 1999) has also suggested to me thatSoyinka’s early fraternity at what became the University of Ibadan was the first andmost influential of the academic men’s associations. Professor Kalu has written anunpublished report on campus violence and cultism for the Nigerian Social ScienceResearch Council.9 See Ogundipe-Leslie (1994), Okeke (2001) and Bastian (forthcoming b) for more onwomen’s problems in Nigerian education.10 See, for instance, the Better Lovermagazine story (Anonymous 1998a). In thisnarrative, a young woman of a lower class background is seduced by a prominent andelite member of a campus cult. Although she believes that she has found romanceand upward mobility, she is actually being targeted for a gang rape during the cult’supcoming initiation. Her return to a ‘proper’ class orientation after the brutal assaultis signalled in the subtitle of the piece: ‘I’m through with UNILAG [University ofLagos] students and their cults Wahala, Oshodi traders here I come.’ While we haveno means for evaluating the truthfulness of sensationalistic periodical stories like thisone (which is couched as a ‘problem page’ story, asking for reader advice, I amconvinced that the topics of such narratives are important for gauging indigenouspopular consciousness. Certainly such topics sell newspapers and magazines, andthey find their way into the Nigerian electronic media with great frequency. I makeno claim for the veracity of this particular story, but am interested here moregenerally in the pervasiveness of campus cultism and gang rape within currentNigerian popular discourse. See Gumpert 1987, Bird 1992, Turner 1993, Dégh 1994,and Bordo 1997 for more on folkloric and popular narratives in the Euro-Americansensationalist press. I consider such stories to have a similar hold over western popularconsciousness.11 In one of the worst incidents documented of cult violence in recent years, sixstudents at Obafemi Awolowo University were murdered, a number of others injuredand the wife of the Vice Chancellor was kidnapped in early July, 1999. See Ndiribe1999 and Nwandu 1999 for more on the OAU killings.12 For a more positive perspective on Nigerian peacekeeping in Sierra Leone, seeRichards 1996: 20–21.13 For several examples of this Africanist stereotypy, see Marwick 1970 (particularly thechapters by Schapera, Krige and Wilson). In a more contemporary Africa, seeComaroff and Comaroff 1993 (especially Apter, Auslander and Austen).14 All ogbaanje confessions quoted in this section are from Anonymous 1998b.15 This dichotomous marital discourse continues to the present day in Nigeria; seeBastian forthcoming b and Okeke 2001.16 ‘Walk-about’ women or the femmes libresof the African cities of the 1950s onwardsModern magics in Nigerian popular media 91"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"are well-known figures in anthropological literature.

These were the last years of the dictatorial regime ofpresident Kamuzu Banda and in the various townships of a city like Blantyre,the country’s largest commercial centre, the political machinery was intensifyingits coercive presence in a variety of ways. There were the Ayufi(youth-league ofthe ruling party) who by positioning themselves overtly near such places asmarkets, bus stations and hospitals embodied the presence of the state. Peoplewere flogged if they did not obey orders. Township residents were coerced intoattending compulsory party meetings where the display of political power byparty-bosses was required to be observed with awe and respect. Peopledisappeared as a result of the many eyes and ears which those in power sent outsecretly through the townships to control dissent or open criticism. Perhapseven more intimidating than the Ayufiwere the Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP),Banda’s elite troops – well trained, well armed and parading in their splendiduniforms. It was as if no one could control the display of violence they wouldunleash on township residents if disobedience had been noted by those inpower. Even the chiefs (mfumu) in the local residential areas shivered and shookwhen MYPs or the Ayufientered their areas in search of dissention, as cries ofagony came closer and closer. The noise of deliberately broken cooking pots aswell as the sound of the destruction of small gardens were, on such occasions,heard through a township, provoking much anxiety. And in the BlantyreKamuzu Stadium, President Banda would occasionally dance with the Zinyau,the masked representatives of the Nyausecret society. The young dancers of thissociety, to which only initiated men of the Chewa- and Mang’anja-speakinggroups of Central and Southern Malawi belong, are commonly referred to aszilombo, that is, wild animals from the bush. They were notorious for spreading areign of violent terror in the villages (see also Kaspin 1993; Englund 1996b).Their occasional appearance on the city’s outskirts invariably caused great alarmand distress. While the eyes and ears of Banda were perceived as omnipresent and thevisual presence of the various features of the political machinery loomed large,there was another spectacle of power becoming increasingly evident. BannersChapter 5Witchcraft and scepticism by proxyPentecostalism and laughter in urban MalawiRijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"and flyers called for redemption and obedience to the word of God; they spokeof the need to banish sin and, even more, all Satanic influence. Amidst theturmoil in townships, markets and bus stations, street-preachers stepped forward,many of them teenagers, calling on people to repent before it was too late,before the wrath of God was unleashed on all unbelievers (van Dijk 1992a,1992b, 1993, 1998). Large revival meetings were held where fire and brimstonepreachers would mollify all who stopped to listen. Many would publicly kneel infront of these preachers and repent their sins. This might have been interpretedas a youthful parody of well-respected (religious) authority if their publicperformance had been less convincing or less effective. However, the shouts andcries of those caught up in the atmosphere of excitement these religious meetingsproduced were clear signs of the power that these youths commanded. TheirChristian fundamentalist message always touched on the issue of witchcraft asthe centre of innate evil. It fostered the imagery of a satanic power that theirpreaching could work against, in particular, to cleanse urban society. Theirhighly emotional displays of ‘fighting’ and of ‘casting out’ evil spirits createdmuch awe and respect. Indeed, they touched a central nerve. Witchcraft madepeople disappear, it made people suffer, it made ordinary township residents fallvictim to the evil powers of a nocturnal world, producing in the process onehaunting question: are politics and witchcraft one of a kind?2Although theseyoung preachers were unrelated to the political power of the party youthorganizations, and often had a different background than these age-mates, theyeffectively placed themselves in the domain of these powers and the imagerythey produced (van Dijk 1999b). Under such tense circumstances, in this situation fraught with fear, it mightappear odd to discuss scepticism and ridicule. This general social anxiety,produced by the frantic search for dissidents by militant youth as well as by theecstatic search for sinners of witchcraft by preaching youth, may seem to leavelittle space for such demotive discourses. However, Mbembe has argued incisivelyfor the banality of power in the postcolony, the playfulness, conviviality andlaughter by which ‘ordinary people bridle, trick and actually toy with powerinstead of confronting it directly’ (Mbembe 1992: 22). Whereas examples aboundof such forms of scepticism in the field of political power, very little has surfacedin a similar vein in the study of witchcraft in the Southern African region. Inmost accounts of witchcraft, horror reigns over humour, scare over scepticism.Recent studies emphasize the modernity of witchcraft in Africa and are inclinedto demonstrate how discourses on occult forces, in fact, address Africa’s modernpredicament. Many scholars emphasize the ambiguities, anxieties and aspirationsmany people face in postcolonial societies (Comaroff and Comaroff 1993, 1999;Geschiere and Fisiy 1994; Geschiere 1997; Shaw 1997). These studies, rangingfrom Sierra Leone to Cameroon and to South Africa, explore how witchcraftbeliefs are not an archaic residue likely to disappear from African societies asmodernity progresses, but must be seen as a domain where simultaneously themagical lure as well as the anxiety about the modern world with its capitalist98 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"relations and unimaginable wealth are addressed. In zombie-scares, panics aboutthe occult trade in body parts and new witchcraft eradication movements thesestudies read deep-seated anxieties about the exposure to a wider world engulfedin a capitalist and therefore dehumanizing system (see, for instance, Fisiy andGeschiere 1991; Auslander 1993; Englund 1996a; Meyer 1999; Comaroff andComaroff 1999).3In this context, witchcraft is solidly and exclusively representedas a domain of the fantastic and horrific.4This chapter, however, draws attention to experiences of witchcraft whichallow for laughter and local scepticisms whilst acknowledging the advancementthat has been made by post-modern studies. In investigating the above-mentioned street-preachers in one of the townships in Blantyre, it became clearthat witchcraft appeared as a salient domain of conviviality and playfulness. Itspoke much less to the kind of imagery that reveals modernity’s malcontents or amystique of the world market per se. Rather, the Pentecostal ideology presentedby these preachers and their charismatic fellowships created the space toexperience witchcraft in terms of mockery, laughter and amusement. Over the last two decades, Pentecostalism has become a very popular form ofChristianity in Malawi’s major cities (see van Dijk 1992b, 1995, 1998; VonDoepp 1998). Reviewing earlier fieldwork material of a Pentecostal fellowshipreveals the sense of amusement that became part of many instances of witch-craft self-confession that took place. In some cases this humour became moremeaningful than ‘just’ entertainment. Pentecostalism appeared to foster a kindof scepticism towards the domain of power that the discourse on witchcraftreferred to. In the suburb I studied, known as Chilomoni, both the repre-sentatives of the nation-state as well as the ‘traditional’ authorities of the chiefand of the historical Christian churches had great difficulties coming to termswith the capricious nature of the self-confessional style of witchcraft affairs inthe Pentecostal fellowship. Whereas over the past decade or so, many studieshave explored the rise of this new brand of Pentecostalism across Sub-SaharanAfrica,5attention to this aspect of its ideology has been minimal. This chaptercalls for a more nuanced investigation of the scepticism that sometimessurrounds witchcraft in the context of emerging Pentecostalism as a dominantcontext of identity formation as was the case in the Malawian situation. Thechapter concludes by underscoring the need for a socioculturally-inspiredanalysis of the sceptical style that emerges as the distinguishing mark of suchmodern religious formations.Pentecostal street-preachers in MalawiIn Malawi, the younger generation has largely supported the spread of a newkind of charismatic Pentecostalism (van Dijk 1992a, 1993, 1995, 1998). Fromthe mid-1970s it became increasingly popular among university and collegestudents. Small groups of itinerant preachers began moving around in Malawi’slargest cities. In townships they organized revival meetings, usually attended byPentecostalism and laughter in Malawi 99"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"large numbers of local residents, where they propounded an ideology in which anew but very rigid moral code would play a crucial role. It stressed the need notonly for every individual to cleanse him or herself of sin, but also for the nationas a whole to purge itself of its vices: heavy drinking, smoking, violence,promiscuous sexual conduct and so on. This moral code also implied clear-cutnotions of which forces should be held responsible for all these seeminglyrampant evils. All kinds of spirits, ranging from ancestral spirits to the ‘spirit ofwitchcraft’, as they called it, were rigidly classified as representations of Satan.The young preachers held these demonic forces responsible for the lack ofprogress and prosperity individuals and Malawi as a whole were experiencing.The large revival meetings they conducted concentrated on deliverance ofdemons and the protection against witchcraft. Their calls for purificationseemed to resonate with a collective memory of earlier mchapewitchcraft-cleansing movements as well, to which I return below. Before turning to this issue, however, some remarks are in order about thehistory of this form of Pentecostalism in colonial and postcolonial Malawi inrelation to the advent of young revival preachers. To a large extent this move-ment of preachers can be interpreted as the most recent stage in the developmentof independent Christianity and Pentecostalism in this society. This has beenunderway since the first decade of the twentieth century (see also Schoffeleers1985). The first Pentecostal churches established in the country were of the so-called ‘full gospel’ type, including such denominations as the Assemblies of Godand Full Gospel Church of Christ. Usually led by white missionaries from theUK, the US and South Africa and occasionally by missionaries from blackpentecostal communities in the US, these churches made their way to the thenprotectorate of Nyasaland from South African cities. In a way they were‘latecomers’, as missionization in various parts of this region by Presbyterian andRoman Catholic churches had been well underway since the 1870s. Theseevangelistic and pentecostal churches, however, developed specific and counter-acting forms of Christianization. They preferred to approach young converts toact as itinerant preachers (alaliki, literally ‘sayers’) who would be employed toorganize massive revival meetings in what was then Nyasaland (now Malawi) asearly as 1920. They acted zealously against what they perceived as heathenism,greatly alarming chiefs and colonial authorities alike (Fields 1985: 43). Manysuch churches, including early Watchtower movements, regarded these youngconverts as an excellent class of daring preachers. They were prepared to penetrateremote areas, usually under the most difficult circumstances. From 1910 to 1930waves of mass revivalism occurred in areas belonging to both present-dayZambia and Malawi which particularly alarmed many white missionaries of theestablished Christian churches (who regarded this development as runningagainst their own expansion and conversion efforts [Ncozana 1985: 199–202]).Many of the preachers’ activities went hand-in-hand with witchcraft-cleansing. Their work had been so effective, in fact, that when in the late 1920sand early 1930s the young mchapewitch-finders began their eradication100 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"practices in southern Malawi, they regularly skipped those villages that hadbeen ‘Christianized’ through these revivals.6During the same period myriad African Independent Christian churches alsoappeared. Many scholars would interpret the proliferation of Pentecostalchurches as belonging to the overall development of these forms of syncreticChristianity – of which many so-called prophetic-healing churches are part –that took place in the early decades of the twentieth century. In Malawi this ledto the establishment of large numbers of Zion and Apostolic churches, but alsothose of the Providence Industrial Mission which played a crucial part in thefirst uprising against the colonial regime in 1905. However, there are a number of crucial differences which are important tomake sense of the rise of the movement of Pentecostal street-preachers in the1970s and 1980s. As many scholars have shown, the rise of ‘independent Christ-ianity’, particularly in the form of the prophetic-healing churches, implied asyncretization of religious discourse and practice. Many of these churchesincorporated important elements of local cosmologies, healing practices andstyles of leadership. They often merged elements of missionary Christianity (theBible, hymns, styles of dress and uniforms) with a range of healing and cleansingpractices that related directly to ‘traditional’ forms. Their healing prophetscatered for a wide array of problems perceived to be caused by occult powers,evil spirits and the like which the established white missionary churches wereprone to dismiss as unreal, heathen, superstitious and the product of ignorance.Hence, these churches offered many people what missionary churches couldnot, or would not. However, the Pentecostal churches, from which the street-preachers havearisen, have always maintained a critical distance from both the healingchurches and the established missionary churches. Effectively, they took a thirdway from which much of their present-day popularity may be explained. Theycritiqued the missionary churches for denying what was so obviously a part ofeveryday African life: occult forces. These were and still are in Pentecostalideology understood as manifestations of satanic power. It was also on thisaccount that these Pentecostal churches have remained dismissive of the healingchurches’ syncretic practices. As the ‘traditional’ practices for healing, protectionor exorcism may in themselves be contaminated by demonic influences, itfollowed that these churches could not be trusted either. Instead, the Pentecostalchurches began stressing ecstatic deliverance sessions in which prayer healingand possession by the Holy Spirit is sought. Herbs, candles, water, fire or othersubstances that are commonly used in both traditional healing practices and inhealing churches tend not to be found among these Pentecostal churches, nor inthe practices of the street-preachers.The variety of Full Gospel churches and the Assemblies of God in Malawi,all belonging to this brand of charismatic Christianity, began to Africanize theirleadership and essential elements of ideology and ritual practice in the 1950s,without resorting to the form of syncretism that healing churches did. It is fromPentecostalism and laughter in Malawi 101"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"these Africanized ‘full gospel’ type of churches that the first ‘pioneers’ of themovement of born-again Pentecostal preachers have sprung, starting somethingnew and much more ‘charismatic’ in outlook.7By the late 1970s the preachers had established small organizations, usuallycalled ‘fellowships’ or ‘ministries’. Numerous prayer meetings were organized atmany places in town, at different hours of the day throughout the week. This‘grid’ of meetings enabled confirmed Pentecostal born-again believers to maintaina kind of constant spiritual guidance. It gave them the opportunity for regularcommunication with the benevolent heavenly powers they needed to tap intoand sustain a sufficient level of ‘sealing off ’ (kutsirika) against evil, outside forces.Some of the fellowships gradually turned into churches, with formal membershipand an established leadership.8As has been reported across Africa, this form ofPentecostalism usually leads to a wide proliferation of hundreds of churches.9The personal acumen of the Pentecostal leaders amounts to much and thechurch, the ministry or the affiliated business ventures are, in a real sense, hisproperty (it is noticeable that women do not often hold similar positions).Within only a few years, these Pentecostal groups managed to attract a largefollowing in Malawi’s urban areas. Initially they appealed to the young andemergent urban middle classes, but gradually they expanded to include groups ofthe less educated and less fortunate. Following in the steps of these successfulpreachers, in the expanding urban townships, other young people, often withouthigher education and without the prospects of a secure position in life, beganforming similar fellowships for their activities as inspired preachers. All of asudden, in a city like Blantyre in the 1980s, dozens of these preachers could befound. The youngest I met was only 9 years old. The first group of preachers has ‘produced’ over time well-known names andnational figures such as Madalitso Mbewe. In the month leading up to thegeneral and presidential elections of 15 June 1999, he organized the first ever‘presidential prayer breakfast’ which was attended by the state president, BakiliMuluzi. The second cohort of preachers was far less prolific in the nationalpublic realm. The exception here is a young woman by the name of LinleyMbeta who, aged 19, created the Redemption Voice Ministries in 1989 andbecame president Banda’s personal spirit-healer in the final years of his regime(see van Dijk 1994b). Her preaching sessions often took the form of a witchcraft-eradication event where people were searched for their witchcraft-relatedamulets (zitumwa). There was massive, popular interest in these sessions, whichvery much recalled a kind of collective memory of the mchapewitchcraft-cleansing ceremonies organized by young men in the 1930s.10Although young preachers of this second cohort remained confined to thepoorer urban areas, this did not mean that they had less access to thePentecostal rhetoric that had become so essential in the overall success of this‘Pentecostal wave’ in the first instance. This will be demonstrated in the nextsection by discussing the Miracle Power of God-Fellowship that operated inBlantyre’s Chilomoni township. Noteworthy is how well-versed these leaders102 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"were and still are in the current Pentecostal discourse which their highlyeducated ‘predecessors’ produced, which often contains transnational featureslike addressing their followers in English, and referring to internationalliterature like Emmanuel Eni’s Delivered from the Power of Darknesswhich wasproduced in Nigerian Pentecostal circles.11To date, this Pentecostal ideology has stressed a religiously-inspired dichotomybetween ‘tradition’ and the ‘past’ versus the ‘modern’ and the present-day world,the inferior against the superior (Meyer 1998). The exorcist and spirit-healingsessions organized by the preachers include an inspection of a person’s life, his orher place within the family and the family’s spiritual background. By stressingthe ‘born-again’ experience the preachers aimed to sever a person from his orher past life and therefore from a history of involvement in, for example,ancestral veneration, spirit possession or spirit-healing rituals. Preachers urgedtheir audiences to seek what they call the ‘infilling’ of the Holy Spirit (MzimuWoyera, lit. the White Spirit). This protects people from the powers of their pastthat may continue to haunt them in the present. As a result, for the true born-again believer (abadwo mwatsopano), taking part in rituals where ancestraldeities are venerated, such as in funeral ceremonies, has become problematic. Witchcraft and evil spirits are frequently seen to originate from either theimmediate family and/or from some of the rituals in which the person hadparticipated in the past. These include, for example, initiation rituals or healingthrough ‘traditional’ forms. Asing’anga, the healers and herbalists, are invariablyclassified by these preachers as ‘witchdoctors’. They emphasize the ambiguousnature of their healing powers by claiming that demons are always involved inwhat is administered to the person. ‘Traditional’ healing was declared an inferiormode of solving problems which are perceived as being caused by real andpowerful demonic and occult forces. Witchcraft is therefore not considered meresuperstition, a position long held by the established churches. Neither is it aproblem for which the asing’anga, the local healers and witchdoctors, wouldneed to be consulted. Much of the power to fight witchcraft afflictions is put inthe hands of the confirmed believer him/herself. Through prayer sessions,deliverance hours and fasting it is believed that the identity of the afflictingwitch will be revealed, as well as what can be done about it. Public testimonies of witchcraft afflictions are common practice duringPentecostal prayer meetings. Often people confess to having been involved inwitchcraft; Satan is held ultimately responsible for such behaviour. InPentecostalism both the accused and the afflicted find a relatively safe haven forcounteracting in the spiritual realm the forces that haunt them. As discussedearlier, prayer-sessions are perceived as a method of putting in place spirituallyprotective walls against witchcraft (again indicated by the term kutsirika). Tothis end the street-preachers, after the initial stages of their movement,established ‘intercession groups’ and ‘prayer towers’ where people devoted muchof their time to ecstatic prayer (this is also the background of the fellowship, asdiscussed in the following section).Pentecostalism and laughter in Malawi 103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The mission churches have always remained critical of the success of themany Pentecostal churches that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. They becameeven more alarmed by the youthful appeal of the street-preachers in the 1980s.The charismatic preachers began to gain a massive following, particularly amongthe young membership of churches such as the Church of Central AfricanPresbyterian (CCAP). It is beyond the scope of this chapter to detail how andwhy conflicts developed and what it meant for the established churches to losetheir far-reaching spiritual control over the younger generation when manyturned to the Pentecostal, charismatic groups. However, it is important to notethat, for many, the advantage was and is that the fellowships did not requirethem to resign their membership of the established churches and thereby runthe risk of losing the potential benefits of membership. The street-preachersmade their fellowships ‘interdenominational’ and made clear that their onlygoal was the elimination of satanic forces from society.12The Pentecostal street-preachers’ movement was and still is fundamentally amovement from within. It is an attempt to rejuvenate Christianity, publicmorale and to campaign effectively against witchcraft. It became accepted in aMalawian society which, at that time, was already deeply aware, both historicallyand politically, of the power youths can muster. Both the power of the militantyouth bodies as well as the spiritual power of the street preachers were deeply‘modern’, and even though each ventured to make its presence felt in the sameurban space, they never collided directly. Any direct criticism of how the regimeused young people as instruments of political coercion was too dangerous.Rather, in the way the Pentecostal preachers treated witchcraft – humorouslyand playfully ridiculing how youths were often enlisted in the service of witches– they affected political power in a less confrontational way. As the followingcase will show, in Pentecostal groups scepticism of certain witchcraft casesbecame an important element in their exercise of spiritual power.The Miracle Power of God-FellowshipAt the age of 16 Peter Mbepula decided to move from his small home villagenear the city of Zomba (approximately a one hour drive from Blantyre) toChilomoni-township in Blantyre. His maternal uncle (malume) had offered topay his secondary school fees, which his parents could no longer afford. Hedemanded that Peter come and live near him in the township’s remoteMulunguzi area. Although Peter and his uncle were Yao-speakers by birth (theYao ethnic group is the largest Islamized unit in Malawi, Islam comprising about18 per cent of the total population), their family had not converted to Islam.Soon after arriving in Mulunguzi, Peter came into contact with PentecostalChristianity, through meetings organized by a nearby branch of the UnitedApostolic Faith church, and particularly by a number of Pentecostal ministriesin the city centre. Soon he experienced a mystical ‘rebirth’ and became anenthusiastic participant in many such meetings. 104 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"His schooling was not a success, as Peter started to experience visions andrevelations. He predicted misfortune (‘hindsight’, as he called it) for someMulunguzi residents. Further, as he started laying on of hands, people reportedthat they had been miraculously healed of certain ailments. Within two years ofhis arrival, it was clear to many people that Peter had developed specialcharismatic gifts, and that Mulunguzi was becoming a special place because ofhis presence. He proclaimed that he had received from God a ‘discerning spirit’.This enabled him to see, via the spiritual realm, those residents who practisedwitchcraft and those who had been affected and afflicted by it. A small group ofMulunguzi residents formed to support him in his preaching and cleansing‘ministry’. Outside the Mulunguzi area of Chilomoni, Peter began preaching invarious parts of Blantyre (the Central Market in particular). In addition he wentwith his support group and organized ‘crusades’ in and around Zomba (van Dijk1995).13The activities outside Mulunguzi can be interpreted as a kind of ‘outreach’ forhis moral message. However, inside Mulunguzi, his activities were of a differentnature. Here they took the form of a witchcraft-cleansing project. To avoidmaking open witchcraft accusations he developed a practice of visiting neigh-bourhood houses which he searched for witchcraft-related objects, in particular,the so-called zitumwa(sing. chitumwa). These are the kind of amulets believedto contain a chizimba, considered the active ingredient in the chitumwa. Anamulet containing the chizimbamay give its owner unimaginable power orwealth, but there is a dark side. This is the sort of esoteric material that can onlybe obtained by partaking in the nocturnal witches’ activities where human‘meat’ is harvested and body parts are taken from the corpses of those killedthrough witchcraft. The person will be commanded to kill a close relative toobtain the right kind of body parts and must consume human corpses atnocturnal orgies (i.e. become a witch). Peter’s discerning spirit, he claimed, allowed him to see ‘hyenas (afisi)standing on their hind feet at night’, a sign that witchcraft was present. It alsoled him into the houses of possible culprits in search of zitumwa. With this activity some people began moving from Mulunguzi by the end ofthe 1980s. Although the local ruling party chairman (the most powerful politicalauthority in the area) received some complaints by members of other churches,particularly the Seventh Day Adventists, overall a relaxed and even cheerfulatmosphere predominated. People joked about what Peter saw in his visions ofcertain people’s nocturnal activities and these stories were at times a source ofhilarity and laughter. The group, which named itself the ‘Miracle Power of God-Fellowship’, built a wattle and daub meeting place in the centre of Mulunguziwhere its ‘prayer-tower’ was held. Around it the same atmosphere of ‘relaxation’was evident as I experienced at the public meetings of the above-mentionedLinley Mbeta. Although she pointed openly at people during her meetings aspossible candidates of witchcraft-involvement, this was at the same timediscussed in an ambivalent mixture of hilarity and fear, mockery and anxiety,Pentecostalism and laughter in Malawi 105"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"jokes and images of the frightening. In her and Peter’s case laughteraccompanied the discussions and gossip of how a certain individual was involvedin kutamba, that is, the naked dancing at night while devouring human flesh aswitches reputedly do during their orgies. Or how another person would moanlike a zombie, magically enslaved by witches for their feasts. Both Linley Mbeta(on a wider level) and Peter Mbepula (on a smaller scale in Mulunguzi) appearedto be experts at conjuring up the image in their speeches of laughing at fear, ofplaying with chilling images, of turning witchcraft into an element of entertain-ment. Linley Mbeta took great pride in pointing at ‘sinners’ during herpreaching sessions and of bringing these people forward so that everybody could‘take a good look at them’. Roaring laughter usually accompanied such instanceswhen people were brought up and requested to kneel before Linley Mbeta.While most of these ‘sinners’ laughed too, the audience’s or Peter’s laughterfollowing at Mulunguzi was more than just enjoyment at somebody else’sexpense. There was something genuinely relaxing about it, something equallyrecognizable in many other Pentecostal groups of young street-preachers inBlantyre. Witchcraft, kutambaand similarly ambiguous images could be turnedinto a source of parody by the superior spiritual powers that the Pentecostal faithcould muster. Some of these groups even performed drama plays on stage andacted out, with a great sense of humour, the fears and anxieties involved. However, another event at Peter’s Fellowship made me aware of a furtherdimension in this play of ambiguity in the construction of the ‘witch’ (mfiti).Gradually it appeared that, without necessarily being the same, laughter andamusement turned into scepticism. A sceptical attitude towards some manifesta-tions of the occult (i.e. the force itself and not just its bearer) became apparentwith regard to the boys’ behaviour. One day I was informed that the Fellowship had received two boys, around12 years old, who had been sent to Mulunguzi from relatives of Peter in hishome village. The two boys soon turned out to be great sources of amusementfor the few hundred inhabitants of Mulunguzi. The local traditional authority(mfumu), the party chairman and other dignitaries were all greatly interested inmeeting these boys. They initially enjoyed listening to their otherwise gruesomestories (albeit with a touch of mockery too) and many came to see the two boysto be amazed by their experiences of witchcraft. The boys related to anybodywho would listen their stories that, at night, they played football with theirrelatives’ heads. These relatives suffered from bruises, swellings and terribleheadaches when, at dawn, their heads were magically re-attached to their bodiesafter a ‘good’ night’s football match. Roars of laughter could be heard when thetwo boys described what the rumpled faces looked like after a number of kicksduring the witches’ match. However, dead silence invariably fell once the boys began giving furtherdetails of other witchcraft activities. They told of how they tore out theirvictims’ hearts, kidneys or uteruses. Or how they constructed aeroplanes fromhuman bones and blood – the planes’ skeleton and fuel – and put a stolen silver106 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"coin in the middle of the plane to make it fly to South Africa. And even howthey would open graves and feast on the corpses, or eat close relatives ‘from theinside’ to gain control over their life-power. A wide range of witchcraft themesappeared to belong to their repertoire. For several weeks people flocked to Mulunguzi to hear with their own earsthe boys’ stories, clearly demonstrating their fascination with this mixture ofhorror and humour. But there was suddenly a turning point in the boys’ success.This can be understood by the following. The boys were clearly placed into thehands of Peter Mbepula and under the care of the Miracle Power of God-Fellowship. In Peter’s home village their stories had caused some turmoil; toomuch talk of witchcraft, villagers felt, might provoke worse happenings in thecommunity. Peter’s and the Fellowship’s reputation for sealing off (kutsirika) thearea against outside evil had spread to this village. Pentecostal fellowships, theirprayer towers and intercession groups served to contain evil, to cast it out andthus to operate as purgatory devices. Evil cannot easily return to those placesfrom which it has been eradicated.But these are also places of ‘truth’, of transparency, where ultimately nothingremains hidden. Even innate evil through the born-again experience of ‘infilling’by the Mzimu Woyera(lit. the White Spirit) will always transpire (in stressingthat transparency, both Linley Mbeta and Peter Mbepula for instance tended todress in white). From the perspective of the relatives in the village, theMulunguzi Fellowship in its urban location was a ‘white’ place; a place wherethe truth behind the boys’ witchcraft experiences would eventually come out.The haunting question was obviously who was to be held responsible for theseyoung children’s involvement in such horrific and heinous behaviour. However,where there was fear in the village there was laughter in the urban location. Initially, neither Peter nor the Fellowship was very interested in discoveringwho was behind their proclaimed evil. This changed abruptly when after someweeks the boys began naming names. Laughter quickly turned into disbelief andthe one was in no way synonymous with the other. One of those they named, aman the boys claimed had appeared in their visions and nocturnal ‘adventures’,was Peter Mbepula’s father, who still lived in his home village. Here, the boyshad apparently overstepped the boundary and now found people sneered atthem. Sceptical views of their activities and stories now dominated. Previouslysuch views were one among many ‘voices’ present during the discussions and,above all, during moments of laughter about the boys. But now people openlywondered: ‘How could this be true?’ For weeks the Fellowship was in turmoil asthe scepticism produced by the young boys’ conduct raised questions of howtruth can be ascertained. No one doubted the reality of witchcraft. Rather, theywere concerned with its manifestations and how God’s ‘wonder-working power’could be enlisted to provide the kind of transparency required. Members of theFellowship now met at the small prayer hut more than three times a day – someeven decided to stay away from work to participate – and held extended prayersessions throughout the night. After all, if the boys were not telling the wholePentecostalism and laughter in Malawi 107"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"truth, the Devil must be in their midst. To laugh about the truth is one thing,but to joke with deception is quite another! Consequently, Peter organized a ‘crusade’ to his home village. A crusade isthe common organizational form by which born-again groups ‘reach out’ fromtheir urban locales to remote rural places (van Dijk 1995). It is an attempt tostamp out occult forces in what may almost look like a military campaign.14Before leaving with a number of members of the Fellowship, Peter publiclydistanced himself from his father. He claimed that he ‘hated him’ and statedthat it was time that all the witchcraft in which these elders were involved inChindenga village was eradicated once and for all. Although he encountereddifficulties with this crusade with the local chief and particularly with the localPresbyterian minister (from the nearby Songani parish) he returned after a fewweeks very much satisfied with what he had accomplished. The boys were sentback to the village, thoroughly cleansed, and Peter’s reputation was even stronger.Interpretation: scepticism by proxyGable (1995) has argued incisively that local manifestations of scepticism areoften interpreted by anthropology as a (by-)product of modernity. Scepticismreflects the operation in society of destabilizing notions, ideas and perceptionsthat often find inspiration in non-local, extraneous cultural resources and whichoften have the sublevel effect of undermining dominant discourses and practices.Gable notes that it is commonly argued that local scepticisms of authority, ofspiritual manifestations and other beliefs – as he found among the Manjaco inGuinea Bissau – are part of the cultural orientation of those members of societywho have been exposed to a modern, urban and western form of life. Modernsocial formations, which have their roots in the colonial experience of westernpower and knowledge systems, missionization, media and the like create a kindof distanced viewpoint. Pentecostalism, I argue, is very much part of how theexperience of modernity produces local convictions and traditions as outmoded,superstitious or backward. In common anthropological interpretations, suchmodern ruptures allow for the emergence of sceptical views of the local and thetraditional. This view, however, fosters a denial on two accounts. First, it excludes thepossibility of ‘indigenous’ sceptical discourses about ‘traditions’ such as the kindof debates Gable drew anthropology’s attention to in his study of the Manjacochieftaincy. Second, it tends to exclude the possibility of the increase of localscepticism vis-à-visthe modern. In this section I argue that the stories the twoboys told and the boys’ involvement with nocturnal witch orgies can beinterpreted in this light. The growing scepticism towards the boys, the laughterthat became less friendly and more biting, also contained a message for themodern postcolonial Malawian state and the way in which it instrumentalizedyouth for its power politics. This perspective allows us to see the modernity ofwitchcraft not only for how it negotiates the ‘doom’ that the encroachment of108 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"modern life brings to local communities, but also for how witchcraft makesmodernity itself the object of scepticism. We need not take witchcraft as ‘deadserious’, as many studies lead us to believe the ‘natives’ do. So there are two issues at hand: one concerns the possibility of laughter inwitchcraft cases, the other is the possibility of that laughter being turned intosomething more meaningful than mere entertainment when an element ofscepticism enters. Many studies emphasize that modern manifestations of witch-craft express and give meaning to people’s anxieties surrounding their incorp-oration into a wider world of capitalist markets, exploitative labour relationsand western consumption and production patterns (see Geschiere 1997). In thisview, witchcraft does not joke with modernity. Although many critical remarks can be made about the postmodern study ofwitchcraft, the point I wish to emphasize is that it does not allow for scepticism,humour and conviviality alongside the horrific.15In such approaches thematerialist condition of encroaching capitalism, modern power and similar issuesappear to exclude parody and mockery. Still, this is exactly what Pentecostalideology and praxis in the case of the boys brought to the fore. It produced notonly a context for laughter, but also provided the grounds for a scepticalattitude. How did it do this? To begin with, Pentecostalism was and is widely experienced as presentingthe believer with clear-cut dichotomies: between the good and the bad, thebenevolent and the malevolent, the Christian and the non-Christian and,above all, between an inferior past against a superior future. A person’s and asociety’s past life is the domain of vices, whereas the present and the futurehave the prospect of (civic and moral) virtue. By becoming a born-again theindividual is believed to be liberated from the ties that bind him or her to thepast and tradition. Severing those ties and becoming ‘born-again’ offers thepromise of progress and prosperity. In Malawi (van Dijk 1998) and elsewhere(Meyer 1998) Pentecostal practice subjects a person’s past and the social andritual representation of cultural traditions to close moral scrutiny. Pentecostalleaders frown upon participation in all types of cultural traditions, for instance,relating to funerals, as these are regarded as sanctified by the ancestors and otherspirits, and are thus unequivocally condemned as ‘demonic’. On this basisPentecostalism creates a critical view of cultural heritage.In the Malawi of that period, however, the Banda postcolonial state madeitself the custodian of a selective range of traditions and called for the preservationof Malawi’s pre-colonial cultural heritage (Vail and White 1989; Kaspin 1993;Forster 1994). President Banda’s Nyaudances at the Kamuzu Stadium inBlantyre were in fact a celebration of that attempt to retrieve a cultural past inthe service of a state’s project of creating a distinctive Malawian nationhood(Vail and White 1989; Kaspin 1993). This nationhood, furthermore, was basedon a kind of (re-)interpretation of Chewa culture, the dominant ethnic groupto which Banda belonged. It also entailed, as Banda was proclaimed theNkhosweNumber One,16a specific circumscribed position of the youngerPentecostalism and laughter in Malawi 109"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"generation (van Dijk 1999b; Tengatenga 1996). Briefly, the form of Chewanationhood Banda envisioned was inspired by the notion of making the youngergeneration subservient to the matriclan, to their custodians and elders.17Boththe Ayufiand the Malawi Young Pioneers were manifest forms of a kind ofnational gerontocratic rule in which they, as youths, would serve their eldersand thus preserve Malawian cultural heritage. It meant that on an everydaylevel much of the coercive political and social power was in the hands of partychairmen and loyal chiefs who had at their disposal these very effective youthorganizations (see also Englund 1996b).In addition to holding these everyday political powers, elders were and stillare generally perceived as being kukwhima, ‘ripened’ in the affairs of the nocturnalworld. Their powers usually provoke awe and respect, and are always assumed tobe present when they successfully exercise their authority and impose their willon others. Some Pentecostal preachers, such as Peter Mbepula or Linley Mbeta,talk about the older generation in general terms like ntakhati, that is, experts inthe things from below the earth, i.e. the realm of the dead (zinthu za kunthaka,lit. the ‘things of the earth’). Their fears of the elders’ nocturnal powers bespokea more general anxiety of being turned overnight into will-less creatures, knownas ndondocha. In the service of the elderly’s occult powers youths felt they couldbe turned into such zombies, whose feet and tongues are magically chopped offto prevent them from running away or wanting their friends (cf. Comaroff andComaroff 1999). It is in this sense that youth found in Pentecostalism a modusto negotiate the overall gerontocratic mode of social and political authority.Within such Pentecostal fellowships as those of Peter Mbepula, scepticismcalled into question on moral grounds the legitimate basis of the elders’authority without confronting it head-on. While Pentecostalism in its deliveranceideology and praxis has never been sceptical about the powers that lie behindmanifestations of social, political or even religious authority, the bearers of thosepowers tend to meet in Pentecostal praxis a lot of parody and ridicule: a form ofindirect contestation. Pentecostal preachers needed to operate with the utmost caution, since it isrisky in such instances of parody and ridicule to name, as Linley Mbetadid, specific persons or to single them out from an audience. In general terms,most of the Pentecostal preachers I met did not feel the political regime wasrestricting them in their preaching activities in the cities, provided theirmessages did not confront political power and authorities directly. Their calls formoral virtues did not directly incite political authorities, nor in particular themilitant youth organizations to take action against them as a kind of generalpublic policy. To the contrary, the Pentecostal ideology in its public mani-festations appeared to produce the kind of acquiescent, a-critical rhetoric whichsuperficial studies of ‘right wing’ religious movements tend to perceive as a kindof common denominator (Gifford 1991). On a local level, as illustrated by Peter Mbepula’s Miracle Power of God-Fellowship, a different picture emerges. Here the relationship with the political110 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"authority of the party representatives became increasingly tense. SomeMulunguzi inhabitants filed complaints against Peter’s witchcraft-findingsactivities; those in power and in influential positions grew increasingly uneasywith these activities. In addition, the township of Chilomoni was targeted for anumber of compulsory party rallies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mulunguzi,as part of Chilomoni, was confronted numerous times in that period by localauthorities, frequently elderly men from the party and the ‘traditional’ chiefs,who flexed their political muscle by sending in Ayufito enforce local partici-pation. They also sent the message to Mulunguzi that ‘Pentecostals hold toomany meetings’, hence disapproving of unauthorized absence from these publicparty meetings. Although direct confrontation with these people of authoritywas not an option for Peter Mbepula and his supporters, he neverthelessdeliberately ‘disappeared’ by holding ‘crusades’ elsewhere. This risky behaviourdemonstrated his independence from the overall social authority structure inwhich youths were supposed to be subservient. Mulunguzi people generally sawthis flouting of authority as a sign of his very special spiritual powers; an area inwhich not even the party chairman, the local mfumuor any other religiousleaders could directly interfere. It was in this context that the two boys arrived to Mulunguzi. After a whiletheir witchcraft stories clearly indicated that elderly relatives had involved themin occult practices in the village and at that point the laughter within PeterMbepula’s Fellowship changed to something much more sceptical. The boys’stories about being used as mindless creatures in the witchcraft affairs of theirvillage elders opened up what I would interpret as a manipulative spacefor scepticism by proxy. For everyone it was clear that the boys’ witchcraft wasmanipulated by their elders (including Peter’s own father) and that laughing atthem implied ridiculing the implicated village elders as well. This laughter didnot deny the seriousness of the occult powers lurking behind these boys’behaviour. Nor did it dismiss the frightening occult grip the elders may have hadover the younger generation. However, it sent a message that counteractingpower both in the daily and the nocturnal realm was possible. In particular, itdisqualified the way elders are perceived to use the younger generation asan instrument for their own interests. By laughing at the two boys, thegerontocratic structure of authority was mocked without denying the seriousnessof the forces these elders presumably commanded. While this laughter eventuallyimplicated the gerontocratic authority structure, through its conviviality thelocal party chairman and other authority holders initially participated in thegeneral atmosphere of hilarity. At that stage laughing with and laughingabout authority were both ambiguously present. The boys, after all, weredemonstrating how foolish it is of elders to think that they can enlist theservices of youth for their nocturnal escapades. ‘You see, this is what the elderstry to do to us’, a younger helper of Peter Mbepula explained to me.18The factthat these boys managed to come to Mulunguzi to reveal these hideous things,fed the Pentecostal-inspired sceptical attitudes within the FellowshipPentecostalism and laughter in Malawi 111"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"concerning the effectiveness and moral legitimacy of gerontocratic authority.Peter Mbepula’s neglect of the orders and obligations set out by local partyauthorities and the chieftaincy was already a clear sign that within thePentecostal domain the powers of the elderly had lost much of their sway. However, when the boys – probably encouraged by their apparent success –began naming names, this mode of scepticism by proxy changed. Their pro-clamations became unambiguously confrontational and might have jeopardizedthe entire Fellowship to which these boys were entrusted. Public witchcraftaccusations were and still are a serious legal offence.19Furthermore, they are asource of turmoil which would have likely provoked the party chairman to takevicious action. The change from laughter to utter disbelief the boys experiencedfrom the side of the Fellowship, should therefore be interpreted primarily as aform of self-protection. It was a way to create a distance from this particularwitchcraft case. The fact that Peter Mbepula set out on a ‘crusade’ to the boys’village shows again that there were no doubts about the true source of this evil.Satan lurks particularly in the villages. Those who fall victim to satanic powers,such as his own father, are to be both ridiculed and pitied.ConclusionThe question remains as to whether dominant discourses, such as those onwitchcraft in Malawian society, contain the seeds of their own negation. Twostudies published in the early 1970s were crucial in critically engaging thethen dominant functionalist perspectives of witchcraft (Sansom 1972; Wyllie1973). It was particularly Wyllie’s study that drew attention to the increasingpopularity of self-confession among new religious groups in Africa. Althoughdrawing heavily on kinship systems and ideologies to explain why particularwomen among the Fante of Ghana were involved in self-confessions ofwitchcraft, it bore witness to the notions of identity and personhood that comeinto play. From a structural-functionalist perspective, Wyllie followed closely onfrom Lewis’ (1975) interpretation of peripheral possession cults. Women’s self-confession, he argued, could be explained as a forceful call for attention fromtheir husbands and other kin. It provides the structurally suppressed with amethod of asserting their position in social structures. This allowed the womensome leverage for material gains and to improve their status. This is an instrumentalist interpretation, and it played a role in critiquingmuch of the research that had been done on witchcraft which emphasizedaccusations and the accused. It had other advantages as well. Although littleelaborated in these terms, these studies were some of the first to hint at therelationship between witchcraft and identity. Self-confession produces witch-craft as a creative space where, in the Pentecostal case, identities of being ‘born-again’, of being ‘delivered’ from the bonds with a past, are produced. Thesestudies were thus able to show that witchcraft discourses also contain the groundfor a reflexive distance in which witchcraft is not only seen as destroying112 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"identities but also of fostering new ones with which confirmed Pentecostalbelievers can demonstrate their spiritual superiority over the occult. Although Wyllie emphasized the instrumentality of self-confessive witch-craft, he did not elaborate on how in Pentecostalism born-again believers’identities are rhetorically produced through negotiations over meanings andintentions of the witchcraft to which a person has confessed. Witchcraftconfessions go further than issues of status and reward alone. They actuallycreate the ideological space where the modern born-again believer is pittedagainst an inferior past: a past in which a person’s life was engulfed by occultand harmful practices. Pentecostalism’s fascination with horrific witchcraftstories plays a role in the construction of a critical politics of identity. Itdestabilizes other frameworks of identity production, such as the modernMalawian postcolonial state, seeking to enhance its dominion over its citizensthrough a specific project of nationhood. On the other hand confessions of witchcraft are also ‘enlisted’ by Pentecostalgroups, such as the Miracle Power of God-Fellowship, to create a favourabledistance with domains of life that are perceived to be ‘traditional’, particularlythose referring to gerontocratic forms of authority. It is this distancing from boththe ‘modern’ and ‘traditional’ that allows the modes of scepticism discussedconcerning the two boys in Mulunguzi to emerge. Scepticism is not onlyproduced by the modern (cf. Gable 1995). It may also critically engage with it,as in this case, where Pentecostalism clearly engages with the modern Malawination. This is not to deny that there is a relationship between witchcraft andmodernity, as a massive recent literature underscores. This relationship, however,may entail not only witchcraft as the domain where modernity is negotiated interms of enticement or anxiety, but where the modern is placed under scepticalrevision as well.Notes1 Fieldwork in Blantyre, on which this chapter is based, took place from 1989 to 1992and was financed by the Dutch Organisation for Social Science Research in theTropics (WOTRO), to which I am greatly indebted. I would like to acknowledgeWim van Binsbergen, Nina Tellegen and Todd Sanders for their valuable commentsand suggestions on earlier drafts of this chapter.2 See also Geschiere 1997, Ciekawy 1998, and Geschiere and Nyamnjoh 1998 forfurther elaboration on the links between politics and witchcraft elsewhere inAfrica.3 Outside Africa important insights can be gained in this respect from Taussig 1980,1987.4 An exception is Bastian (1993), who stresses the element of satire in Nigeriantabloid’s commentary of witchcraft cases that frequently affect the status of localpoliticians.5 Examples can be found on Ghana (Meyer 1998, 1999; van Dijk 1997, 1999a),Nigeria (Marshall 1993), Zimbabwe (Maxwell 1998), Zambia (Gifford 1998), Kenya(Gifford 1993) and Malawi (van Dijk 1992a, 1998).Pentecostalism and laughter in Malawi 113"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"6 During the first years of Malawi’s independence this also applied to the witchcrafteradication activities that emerged in the Southern districts of the country (seeRoss 1969).7 A well-known case of a ‘pioneer’ of the first years of the movement is MadalitsoMbewe of the then-called Pentecostal Revival Crusade Ministry (PRC) whose fatherwas a renowned Assemblies of God pastor in southern Malawi.8 For instance, a fellowship led by the famous preacher Stanley Ndovi turned into theLiving Waters Church during the mid-1980s and the Pentecostal Revival CrusadeMinistries of Madalitso Mbewe established the Calvary Family Church; both aretoday well-known Pentecostal churches in Malawi.9 This also includes the establishment of a plethora of related organizations – e.g.‘crusade ministries’, Bible schools, religious publication houses, music-studiosproducing songs, cassettes and the like which all contribute to the overallentrepreneurial style of this form of Christianity.10 See Richards 1935; Marwick 1950; Willis 1968; Ranger 1972; van Dijk 1994a. Seealso Probst (1999) on the re-currence of mchape-like cleansing rituals in modernMalawi.11 Eni visited Malawi in 1992. For these dimensions of Pentecostalism, see van Dijk1997, 1999a.12 Some street-preachers, whilst clearly ‘Pentecostal’ in their messages and oratorypractices, portrayed themselves as being well-respected members of one of theestablished churches. For example, Linley Mbeta remained a member of the CCAPthroughout her leadership of the successful ‘Redemption Voice Ministry’ whichoperated so effectively against witchcraft. 13 ‘Fighting Islam’ is a common hallmark of these crusades in the Zomba area, generallyassumed to be an Islamic stronghold in Malawi. 14 One of the Pentecostal groups very active in this style of proselytization was, forinstance, called the ‘Aggressive Mission Training Corps’.15 One kind of critique that has been voiced against this dominant view of modernwitchcraft is that although it lives on withinmodernity, it is not necessarily aboutmodernity. It can be about many other issues. Sanders (2000), for instance, shows inhis study on Tanzania how people make clear-cut distinctions between what theyconsider ‘modern’ and ‘traditional’. They link witchcraft eradication activities to thisideological rupture. Sanders shows that their witchcraft concerns relate directly toproblems they perceive as belonging to clearly demarcated traditions (in this caserainmaking rituals). However, again, this interpretation treats witchcraft only as asource of anxiety and does not bring in the possibility that it can be made subject toscepticism including a kind of conviviality.16Nkhosweis the Chewa title for the guardian of the matriclan to whom all young menare subservient (see Phiri 1983).17 Mandala (1990) has analysed in great detail the ever-changing fortune ofgerontocratic rule over the younger generation in Malawi, for instance, by pointingto periods in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when initiation rituals eithergrew in importance or were on the verge of disappearing. One factor explaining therise and fall of such forms of ritual control over the younger generation was, heclaims, the fluctuating demand for labour power. 18 This was E. Bwanali – at the time of these events aged 19 – who would step in for PeterMbepula as a leader of the Fellowship when the latter was absent from Mulunguzi.19 Witchcraft accusations have always been subjected to serious ‘testing’, such as wasthe case under the practice of the mwabvipoison ordeal, outlawed under colonialrule, whereby both the accuser and the accused had to drink the poison cup. This‘testing’ must not be confused with the kind of scepticism that negotiates thestructures of legitimate authority as was implied here.114 Rijk van Dijk"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"BibliographyAuslander, M.

It was against abackground of moral anxieties generated by the presence in the local economyof different types of accumulation that anti-witchcraft shrines flourished incolonial Asante (McCaskie 1981; McLeod 1965, 1975).Shrines were especially popular among those individuals seeking to takeadvantage of new business opportunities. Indeed, the 1930s and 1940s saw anincrease in the number of shrines as witchcraft accusations escalated (Field1937; Fortes 1948; Goody 1957, 1975; Ward 1956). The pursuit of wealththrough the purchasing of fetish from anti-witchcraft shrines was seen assimultaneously dangerous and alluring and, indeed, witchcraft discourses werean implicit critical comment on industrial accumulation as young men wereseen as pursuing individual enrichment at all costs (McLeod 1975). The accumulation of wealth in postcolonial African states continues to be acomplex relation embodied in discourses about materialism and witchcraft.Many scholars have described how a dynamic relationship is formed betweenwitchcraft and the idiom of the market, with the expansion of an occulteconomy alongside the global and cultural forces of modernity (Auslander 1993;Comaroff and Comaroff 1999; Geschiere 1997; Parish 2000; Rowlands andWarnier 1988; Sanders, Chapter 8; Shaw 1997). Yet, it should not be presumedthat the forces of modernity are everywhere the same and something which alllocal economies experience as either threat or enchantment (Englund and Leach2000). Indeed, this dichotomy may often obscure the kaleidoscopic nature ofwhat it means to be ‘up-to-date’ as when businessmen engage with sorcery and‘traditional’ witches infiltrate money markets (Englund and Leach 2000: 228).Or as Comaroff and Comaroff have shown, ‘looked at up close, then, modernityitself all too rapidly melts into air’ (1993: xii).What it means to be modern in postcolonial Africa, as in the pursuit ofmoney and material desires, is an imaginative, provocative and highly specificjourney which may often turn-on-its-head the expansive and taken-for-grantedforces of capitalism (see Meyer 1998). This is illustrated when we look at theChapter 6Black market, free marketAnti-witchcraft shrines and fetishesamong the Akan1Jane Parish"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"symbolic meanings attached to wealth and, by implication, poverty, in present-day Ghana. Power and influence are often looked upon with a particularmixture of admiration and suspicion, as Lentz found in her study of differentgroups of ‘big’ men in Northern Ghana (1998: 51). Meyer, too, illustrates howone man’s opportunity may easily become his downfall, as in a popularGhanaian story told in Accra of a businessman who sought the help of a fetishpriest when his business began to decline. His wealth was regarded by hisrelatives as ‘evil’ because it was earned in league with the devil. The contra-dictory perception of the family as a source of need during times of poverty andinsecurity, and a drain on the wealth of prosperous relatives, is well recognizedas a source of tension and money may be seen as both a blessing and a curse.Meyer analyses how Pentecostal Christians in Accra dream of ‘big’ moneyfrom a safe distance through fantasies about satanic riches and witchcraft. Inretribution, popular narratives tell of satanic bank notes put into the pockets oftheir intended victims to spirit their wealth away (Meyer 1995). The presence of ‘good’ and ‘evil’ wealth highlights the tense relationshipbetween economic aspirations and the legitimation of such wealth, even afterdeath, as in Gilbert’s analysis of the meanings attached to the burial of aGhanaian millionaire (Gilbert 1988; Parish 1999). Amongst the Akan, thisambiguous message about materialism is echoed by clients who visit anti-witchcraft shrines. On the one hand, anti-witchcraft shrines are perceived bymany as a means by which enterprising individuals may, through ‘traditional’magical powers, overthrow the fetters of existing social and moral relationsto accumulate and consume commodities in new ways. On the other hand,shrines may be described by their critics, such as urbanites who live in largecosmopolitan cities, as part of rural African superstition, representative of aheathen past from which they try to distance themselves. In my own fieldwork in the Dormaa-Ahenkro district, Brong-Ahafo Region,shrines are visited by young clients who make witchcraft accusations which arequite often at odds with one another and reflect, among other things, contra-dictory opinions about economic accumulation and the consumption of globalcommodities (Parish 1999, 2000). In many instances, the shrine itself comes torepresent several different cultural transformations all at once. This complexengagement of African spirits with aspects of capitalist development is mostexplicit in the contrasting hopes for the future of two loose circles of young menwith mutual friends in the Dormaa district. Both groups see the prosperousroutes offered them by commercial capitalism as blocked in different ways andtheir varied responses to these predicaments can be seen in their engagementwith anti-witchcraft shrines in the district. While one group sees the anti-witch-craft shrine as helping them to overcome impoverishment and achieve financialsuccess, the other sees the shrine as promoting the worst excesses of capitalistdevelopment and greed, and of corrupting their spiritual heritage. They seek toresurrect at the shrine traditional African values of goodness and respect which,they hope, will promote greater social wealth for all (Geschiere 1997). Anti-witchcraft among the Akan 119"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Anti-witchcraft shrines in the Dormaa districtThe town, Dormaa Ahenkro, is the capital of the district and a major cross-roads for the movement of people both between the villages of the district andbetween Dormaa Ahenkro and the large cities of Kumase, the capital of theAsante Region, Sunyani, the regional capital of the Brong Ahafo Region andAccra, the capital city of Ghana. There is also a bus which travels twice a weekbetween Dormaa Ahenkro and Abidjan in the Cote D’Ivoire.In Akan religion, at the top of the hierarchy is the creator God,Onyame,followed by the earth goddess,Asasa Yaa, and the ancestral spirits,nsamanfo.Access toOnyameis through the deities (abosom). There are currently twenty-three practising anti-witchcraft shrines or abosom-brafo(abosom, pl., deityabrafo,pl., executioner, judge) which, as Goody (1957) records, often spring up andthen disappear, only to reappear in another Region. A shrine is made up ofa small alter constructed from several copper pots and pans and made into astructure several feet high. Perched in one pan is the god (abosom)hiddenamongst twigs and dirt. All living creatures are believed to possess a spirit(sunsum, sing.;asunsum,pl.). Non-humansunsumis calledsasa.Abosomarebelieved to be puresunsum. Hidden inside trees, they attract the attention ofthe person they are to possess by calling him or her into the bush. Subordinateto the gods are a lesser group of spirits or talisman (suman, sing.;asuman,pl.). Apotential shrine-priest (okomfo) will vanish into the bush for several years andbe taught how to communicate with the god before bringing the god to a villagewhere a shrine is built (see Fink 1990; Parish 1999; Rattray 1927). The most important function at theabosom-brafoshrines is possession whenthe god reveals, through the mouthpiece of the shrine-priest, remedies to thevarying misfortunes of shrine-clients. If a witch (obayifo) is present duringpossession, the god will listen to her confess to her crimes and will symbolicallyremove her witchcraft (obayi) which appears as a snake from the vagina (Parish1999). During possession the priest appears to be in a trance-like state, wearinga grass skirt with many charms to it. Outside of possession, shrines are open toanyone who seeks the help of a god. In the majority of cases, clients visit ashrine to purchase protective talismans (asuman)which not only bring financialsuccess but also protect their owners from witchcraft and from evil magic andmedicine (aduto). Greed and wealthThe most popular of the practising shrines are the abosom-brafo-mmoatiabelonging to the forest-dwelling dwarfs. It is at these shrines that perceptions ofboth cultural continuity and change is expressed most explicitly. This isespecially the case at the shrines of the younger shrine-priests. Their shrines arestressed by them as being the most modern because their gods are able totraverse the globe and to be able to offer advice and talismans to deal with120 Jane Parish"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"complex financial and marketing opportunities in the global economy. Oneyoung, male priest summed up the ‘new’ wisdom of his god in the following way:He reads many newspapers . . . international newspapers . . . which explainwhere to invest and attractive products to make a man wealthy . . . ourtalismans keep many secret ingredients which this god has hidden . . . buythis and be rich...other gods read the gossip and about football . . . At thisshrine...we have international opportunities...we understand marketwars!The definitive feature of the modern vision of some of these gods is theknowledge they possess of all things economic, both locally and globally, and,subsequently, the protection and talismans they offer shrine-clients wantingto make money. As the above shrine-priest summed up, ‘not all the gods under-stand how to find money’. For the anti-witchcraft shrine is a potential meansof securing riches for those who, otherwise, are unable to capitalize on theeconomic possibilities offered by the market economy. However, for many youngChristians attending orthodox churches in the Region, the shrine acts as areminder of the worst social excesses of western capitalism and they are seento encourage greed and individual accumulation at the expense of the goodfortune of wider kin and those who work hard and who do not purchasetalismans to achieve quick economic gratification. Thus a most unlikely bedfellowto join in the condemnation of ‘rural’ anti-witchcraft shrines is Sankofa, orAfrikania, a religious movement founded in Ghana 1982 by a former Catholicpriest, Kwabena Damuah, which seeks to spread the word of African traditionalreligion. The legacy of colonialism, it is forcefully suggested, has devalued thetraditional role of the shrine as a place to communicate with God and, instead,their main function has become selling dubious medicines and talismans toclients who use theabosomas a means to achieve great riches. Sankofareprimands those ‘quacks’ who fetishize their shrines gods in the pursuit of greedand who tarnish the ‘good’ name of the shrine. This, Sankofa argues, is not theway to achieve political and economic progress. Rather, in a ‘modern’ Africa,shrine-priests will preach that their gods are angels of God and obey His laws. Itis the views of wealth and greed, expressed by two different groups of youngmen, which are discussed next. The young men described in this chapter are ones I met through Joe, thenephew of a prominent chief. Sitting in the shade in the hot afternoons, in atown in the district, Joe met with his friends, among whom were several relatedto local chiefs and others who were university educated. To this end, I shall referto this loose circle of people as the young aristocracy. The sons and relatives ofthe ‘old’ political elite, they have got stuck in a town which they had hoped toleave for well-paid jobs in the city. Instead, as they see it, they are forced to lookfor interim work that does not match their educational qualifications or socialaspirations. Often connected to one of the many stools in the district, theirAnti-witchcraft among the Akan 121"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"social status confers a certain respect but not financial reward. They feel thatthe postcolonial state has let them down, economically, and that their oftenlow-paid bureaucratic work prevents them from fulfilling their real potential(see Ferguson 1999). At the same time, some also have wealthy kin who areable to finance their further studies, particularly in law, and they hope to travelabroad, although as yet they have failed to prove themselves at ‘home’. Theirsponsors are unwilling to bankroll studentships or careers until convinced oftheir loyalty, integrity and commitment to political office, and until these youngmen show signs of independent initiative and participate more fully incommunity affairs. The young aristocracy in the district are openly contemptuousof many of the witchcraft shrines of the abosom-brafo, which they accuse ofrobbing clients of money and giving the ‘true’ traditional shrine a bad name.Those who attend regularly an orthodox Christian church are adamant thatthey would never visit a shrine because the shrine encourages people to use evilmedicines against one another. There are also some young aristocrats, such asRoy, who secretly believe that people of bad character are able to outwit them,financially, with the help of fetishes they have purchased, although they have noevidence of this:Many thieves and criminals possessasumanwhich cover up their sins andallow them to hide their illegal money from their relatives. They becomevery rich and then use . . . their bad medicines to take the prosperity . . . ofgood people...I am poor because they use secret medicines to harm me . . .I am sure of it . . . they try to make me fail.As Joe once remarked, ‘the shrines bring misfortune on us all . . . they allow badmen to succeed, not me’. Some members of the young aristocracy resent thesporadic financial success of their less educated peers and blame the shrines forgiving ‘greedy’ men and women unfair market advantage. In other words, in theeyes of some aristocrats, the financial possibilities opened to various shrine-clients curtails the opportunities left to those ‘good’ men who do not purchase‘evil’ talismans. The wealth of some and the poverty of others is connected. Many young aristocrats believe that witchcraft is rife in rural areas such asDormaa, and that witchcraft accusations inevitably result when people aregreedy, or do not help less well-off kin when they have the money to do so.Others tell how the spread of colonialism was accompanied by vices such asdeviousness and envy and that a witch is a woman who embodies thesecharacteristics. Many Africans, however, in their view, fell into the clutches ofSatan and turned their back on their own heritage at the expense of pursuingindividual accumulation. Greed, they believe, is the white man’s curse. It isprecisely this type of immorality, they argue, which inhibits the spread of‘traditional’ African values and leaves Ghana in a perilous socio-economic state.Kwesi, whose uncle is a local sub-chief, told how this type of behaviourcharacterised western countries: ‘Western people are not always good. There are122 Jane Parish"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"many murders. . . people turn away from God . . . They think only of muchmoney. There were once many laws in Ghana . . . now there is not so muchlistening to the ancestors. . . we forget their words.’George, Kwesi’s nephew, agreed that greed is a characteristic today of thosewho seek to buy talismans at a ‘rural’ shrine. He thought that the role of the‘rural’ shrine has changed. Whereas once it played an important function incommunity affairs such as helping sick people and promoting honesty andhumility, today there are shrine-priests and shrine-clients who are blinded bytheir own thirst for money. He believed that if the shrine returned to its originalfunction, to serve Onyameand practise kindness and humility, then manyChristians would see that the shrine offers another way of praying, albeit anAfrican way.Joe had dropped out of school and had promised to return at a later dateto take his A-levels. Over the years, as his friends and brothers returned to finishtheir studying in Accra and Kumase, Joe mingled with unemployed youths whoenjoyed no formal education, nor shared his aristocratic background. OftenJoe would sneak off to buy cigarettes from these youths, among them the street-sellers, aware that his mother, a prominent royal in the district, strongly disap-proved of this behaviour. It was through one such cigarette seller that I metKofi, an ice seller, in a town just outside Sunyani, the Regional capital. He livedwith his grandmother and mother in an overcrowded compound where he shareda room with five siblings. He introduced me to other lowly paid youths whowere equally dependent on relatives and who eked out a living selling amongother things, iced water, or manning kiosks with their friends. Others travelled,selling western commodities which they had acquired on the black market.Black market commodities carry a certain glamorous chic for these young men,combining the danger of illegal smuggling with the image of luxury commoditieswhich others, without an avenue to the black market, cannot afford, nor evenlocate. They pride themselves on being adventurers in search of big earningsand of being able to buy any commodity at a cheap price to resell at a profit.These young men spoke about witchcraft in relation to their boasts abouttheir sexual conquests. In most cases, I found, the unemployed youth interviewedbelieve that witches are ex-lovers whom, they complain, were never satisfiedwith their sexual performance, or ex-wives and relatives unhappy with theexpensive luxury gifts they have bestowed on them (Parish 1999). They buytalismans to protect themselves from witches and from the ‘bad’ thoughts andactions of their enemies. Talismans may also be bought by them to overcomeeconomic obstacles put in their way by corrupt businessmen who try to ‘eliminate’potential market competition. For all objects infused with spiritual powers, will,believe many clients, strengthen their economic prowess in the face of tougheconomic competition in the market economy. For the purposes of this chapter,I shall call this loose group of young men, black marketeers.It is not unusual to find gangs of such young marketeers regularly visiting theshrines in the villages, staying for three or four days at a time before returning toAnti-witchcraft among the Akan 123"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"the Region’s large towns and cities. Sometimes, one of them has a relative livingin the locality whom they seek out.

They will banter withone another, smoking and drinking beer all day long, stopping only to pay thechildren a few coins to fetch them fu-fu or rice from one of the sellers cooking atthe edge of the road. Now and then these youths move off, usually to a bar,returning the next day in search of other young men with whom to socialise. Often, if the shrine-priest has no other business to conduct, each young manwill be allowed to consult with the god for a minimum fee, or sometimes for free.They buy talismans to cover a variety of ventures: from the prediction of lotterynumbers, to protecting get-rich-quick schemes, or to protect their intermittentwealth from jealous lovers and rival market competitors. For example, John,aged 23, had been caught smuggling foodstuffs in the boot of his car betweendifferent regions in Ghana by internal border patrols. He was convinced that hiscar was possessed by an evil spirit conjured by his ex-wife. He had visited manyshrines in the Brong-Ahafo and Asante Region but felt that the car had takenon a life of its own, particularly after a near fatal accident involving a tractor.He bought a powerful talisman and hung it over the windscreen. David, aged30, believed that people did not buy cigarettes from him because his ex-girlfriend, whom he alleged to be a witch, had cursed his business. He wanted tobuy a talisman that would not only ward off any evil spirits set in motion by hisenemies, but also bring him prosperity and great riches. One young street-seller,Ken, whom I met through Joe at a shrine in the Dormaa district, was from thelarge market town of Techiman in the Brong-Ahafo Region. He worried thatthe reason many of his schemes had been scuppered by the police was because awitch, a spiteful female aunt, was sapping his energy. He frequently felt tired andlacked the will-power to put his best ideas into practice. The witch was makinghim impotent and this he took as a sign of his decreasing influence in all areas ofhis life. He had bought a fetish, a secret mixture of herbs locked in a smallbracelet which he had also convinced many members of his family to purchaseand was convinced of its ability to turn his life around. In the next section, Ilook at how many of the young marketeers seeking help from the shrines in theDormaa district perceive themselves as the representatives of a capitalist culturemarked out by the interface between Africa and Euro-America.Tradition and capitalIn the eyes of the young marketeers seeking help from anti-witchcraft shrines,the distinguishing feature of western economies is the opportunity for a lot ofpeople to make a lot of money. As one unemployed youth said to me, ‘InEngland everybody is rich’ (cf. Sanders 1999). They see themselves as possessingthe ability to spot gaps in the market which their business acumen will fill andwhich will allow them to make vast amounts of money very quickly, the biggest124 Jane Parish"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"scheme always being just around the next corner. The most ingenious of thesemoney-making-schemes among some young marketeers involved an attempt tosell ‘fetish’ to Europeans and rich Africans and Americans in West Africa so thatthey may sample a bit of ‘African traditional religion’ and protect their wealthfrom ‘their own evil spirits’, said one marketeer, William. William, aged 20, likemany of his contemporaries, often boasted about the money he had earned byselling ‘ancient’ African talisman to wealthy Europeans, and of the contacts hehad in Abidjan and other African cities. He knew, he said, how and where tocross the border to the Cote D’Ivoire quite easily and undetected. To this end, itwas decided to combine a smuggling trip with the selling of talismans to touristsin the Cote D’Ivoire. Thus, William, together with three of his friends, set aboutbuying talismans from a particular shrine at a price agreed with the okomfowhich,incidentally, involved cutting him in on a share of the anticipated future profit.William, together with Joseph, Bulie and Kofi, set off early one morning forthe border where three friends were waiting with a car to take them to theircompound in Abidjan. Resting after their journey, they spent the eveningdrinking at home before retiring to their quarters. The next day, they wanderedaimlessly around the city. In the busiest sectors they stopped and watched otheryoung men mingling among the few Europeans and Americans already on thetourist trail. Selling a variety of commodities from lighters and biros, cassettes ofAfrican music, they set up stall. The next day, William and Kofi marked outtheir pitch to hassle the few tourists around into buying an ‘authentic Africanfetish’. Their plastic shopping bags were stuffed to the brim with bits of herb,cattle tail onto which they had stuck beads and cloth in order ‘to make it looklike African spirits’, and stickers bearing slogans such as ‘I am Afraid Of MyFriends, Even You’ and ‘No Condition Is Permanent’. They came to sell notonly ‘traditional fetish’, but also wooden airplanes painted with the Ghanaairline logo. Many foreign visitors seemed somewhat wary of the youth and hadobviously been warned to be careful of thieves and beggars, which these youngmen gave the impression of being. Gordon, from Ohio, was approached by Kofioutside a bar. He had flown to west Africa on business and had seen it all before:Give them an inch . . . well, they are trying to make a living. Its par for thecourse. In Dakar, believe me, its worse . . . much worse . . . the bullshit...(laughter). I suppose there are mouths to be fed . . . these lucky charms . . .is that the word? Kind of like voodoo, New Orleans stuff. . . gifts for thekids . . . cheap, badly made...better to go to the official market . . . artisanstuff looks better value for money...I’ll pass . . . my kids could have made it!However, some African-American tourists were more readily seduced by theopportunity to buy a little bit of African tradition and felt reassured by the factthat, in their eyes, most Africans had left such superstitions behind and thatthey were being sold souvenirs or relics of this past. Eventually, at the end ofthree days, William had sold at a profit all of the talismans he had bought at theAnti-witchcraft among the Akan 125"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"shrine, although later he played down his earnings when paying the shrine-priest his share. William also managed to purchase cheap alcohol to smugglepast state border patrols, to sell to his customers in remote Ghanaian towns andvillages and give the priests at traditional shrines the cheap liquor used to pourlibation to the ancestors. Trips back to Abidjan became a regular journey forthese young men as they divided smuggling runs and the selling of talismans.Increasingly, however, they were inclined to combine fetish with more estab-lished ‘tourist’ objects, such as cloth, pots and Asante gold figurines which theforeign visitor recognized as ‘African’. Their customers were simply not con-vinced that the shrine fetish was authentically traditional, nor, in their eyes, didit look convincingly spiritual!Money and magicThese young marketeers reinvent and support the abosom-brafoshrine asa means of grasping financial success through magical means. They enjoy little‘official’ support for their plans to flood a potentially lucrative tourist marketwith shrine ‘merchandise’, nor do they seek it. Those of their relatives whohad heard of their exploits thought that they were tempting misfortuneby dabbling with spirits and that their ancestral spirits would be angered bythis. Others, with whom they spoke, simply dismissed their plans as anotherfailed venture which would bring in no money. Some of their friends thoughtthat there was money to be made in the future, but that there were not enoughtourists presently visiting Ghana and those, for example, in the capital, Accra,called in at the official Arts Centres where Kente cloth and Asante gold figurescould be purchased. This, however, in no way deters the young marketeers.Indeed, they prefer it this way because they are left to their own devices andthey meet with little interference. The priest at the particular shrine where theytraded simply desired to make money to support himself and his family andcertainly did not want to have to share any profits with rival anti-witchcraftshrines.Although there is a Dormaa Fetish Priest Association, none of the youngmarketeers saw this as an effective organization to involve in their schemes.Indeed, the association is relatively inactive even though many of the fetishpriests in the district belong to this association and see it as a way of safe-guarding their collective interests. Six priests arranged a meeting of theassociation several months into my fieldwork so that I might buy drinks for thegods of the district! Priests try to represent themselves as a lobbying group, forexample, against government attempts to tax their earnings. However, withlittle money in their coffers, it proves difficult to arrange meetings, particularlyas many priests are illiterate, elderly men who are a law unto themselves andtheir gods, and who suddenly disappear for several weeks without warning.Many also work at shrines found in isolated villages making communicationwith them time-consuming and expensive. Shrine-priests openly compete with126 Jane Parish"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"one another and are very suspicious of one another, especially as the popularityof a shrine at any one time is fairly fragile.Presently, shrines also have very little political support from chiefs who, ascommitted Christians, are keen to distance themselves from the more contro-versial aspects of ‘traditional’ religion, those they associate with witchcraftaccusations and the buying of talismans to protect them from evil. In reality,chiefs tread a precarious path as they seek to accommodate all types of religiousworship while upsetting no one and hoping that no controversy will arise whichwould involve them taking sides. They are willing to tolerate the presence ofthe shrines as long as their profile is kept low. Others simply dismiss theactivities of these shrines as the last vestiges of superstition and believe that ifpeople want to waste their money at such places, then so be it; they do no harmand do not wish to stop them, unless a crime is being committed. Contesting tradition Unlike their elders, many of the young aristocracy abhor how shrines undermine‘the goodness in us all’. The abosom-brafodwell too much on obayi (witchcraft),suggested the son of one prominent chief in the district. The ‘young aristocracy’decry the local abosom-brafoshrines, despite their evident vitality and sporadiccommercial success, for casting shame upon their true African heritage ‘byencouraging the worshipping of stones, rocks and other fetishes’. The shrines,in Joe’s view, perpetuate European myths about African evil such as witchcraftand fetish. Ben, the nephew of a royal stool-holder, described these shrines asencouraging beliefs about witchcraft which have no place in twentieth-centuryGhana. The priests at some shrines, they say, should play down references towitchcraft. In particular, references to fetish is frowned upon, for it is felt thatthis type of discourse has connotations with backward ideas prevalent in Dormaadistrict, with which the young aristocracy do not wish to be associated. We may say that the continued existence and vitality of the anti-witchcraftshrine highlights the predicament in which the young aristocracy are caught.Their rejection of the ‘local’ shrine has much in common with the rejection ofthe past by the global prosperity gospels of charismatic Pentecostalism (Hackett1998; Marshall-Fratani 1998). Yet, in opposition to the global condemnation ofAfricanisation by charismatic Pentecostalism, the young aristocrats are keen tostress that some African shrines are simply a natural predecessor to theChristian church. Local shrines should thus be encouraged to emphasize thepresence of ‘goodness’ in the world and the word of God. Just as Christians inAmerica pray, explained one young son of a prominent Queenmother, so theAfrican uses the shrine as an African communication with God. Hence thearistocrats invent their own recent model of an authentic African traditionalshrine, itself a hybrid model which is held up as representing a true African past.What counts at this ‘model’ shrine is the antiquity of the shrine and their ownassociations with a glorified past. The contemporary vitality of the shrine isAnti-witchcraft among the Akan 127"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"perceived to be embodied in traditional objects such as royal stools, linguists’staffs and cloth, and a ‘continually reconstructed history’ (see Gilbert 1997).These objects embody the past metonymically, but also metaphorically, by con-necting it physically to the present and by representing royalty and distinction. It is this imagery, believed Ben, that should be stressed to foreign visitors whoshould not be allowed to roam around with pimps and criminals who drawattention to the worst characteristics of the wrong type of shrine and itsassociated forms of African worship. The abosom-brafoshrines of the district,along with their shrine-priests, are perceived by the young aristocracy asengaging in immoral behaviour which is a barrier to the rejuvenating of aculture under threat from immoral influences such as alcohol, crime and drugs.For, as noted by Gilbert among the Akuapim, Christianity has often led to adisdain of things traditional as backward (Gilbert 1997). Indeed, the authorityof the old elite is under question by the next rulers of Akuapim. ‘They do notwant to go back to being “fetish” priests sitting on stones; they want to be liketheir former [colonial] rulers’ (Gilbert 1997: 527). In the Dormaa district, theyoung aristocracy, unlike the old elite, denounce many of the shrines as fulfilling‘the white man’s worst prejudices about witchcraft’. Kwame thought that whitepeople who came to Ghana were keen to stereotype African religion as theworshipping of Satan, ‘You see Satan all ways. . . it’s all witchcraft you say’. Hedeclared that shrines are located in rundown compounds which do not dojustice to the great African gods: ‘Religion began here in Africa . . . not with thewhite man.’ Shrine-priests, he claimed, need to be updated about currentreligious practice, ‘not the greedy witch . . . look at the good’. The need is forshrines to represent the ‘right kind’ of African tradition which in Kwame’s eyesis about ‘ancestors and their great acts’. It is often in Accra and Kumase that, as students, young aristocrats firstdeveloped an interest in African ‘traditional’ religion, trampled underfoot, asthey see it, by first European missionaries and now by the charismaticPentecostal movement (see Marshall-Fratani 1998: 285). In Amasu, a town inthe Dormaa district, the movement known as African Traditional Religion orSankofa has a local branch which seeks to counter popular stereotypes about‘traditional’ worship. While not wanting to be seen as supporters of Sankofa for fear of upsettingthe delicate balance between ‘traditional’ and Christian worship, some youngaristocrats see its symbolism as a way in which local shrines can be repackaged.Thus the branch’s compound is adorned with a large yellow cardboard birdwhich can be seen for miles. This is the Sankofa bird, the traditional emblem ofAfrican Religion. A common figure in Akan art, the Sankofa bird is depictedwith an egg on its back, its head turned to gaze toward it. The significance ofthis in African Traditional Religion is that the bird is turning to look at therebirth, reactivation and reorganization of traditional religion. In reiterating the ‘communal’ aspects of religious practice, the symbolismSankofa has developed relies upon powerful images of an African cultural128 Jane Parish"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"heritage and reasserts a cultural independence that rejects the colonial prejudicewhich is said to have destroyed indigenous culture. ‘Culture’, it is assumedimplicitly, is threatened by time. Upon visiting Africa in 1980, the Pope gavethe message: ‘Preserve your culture. Do not let it die. Keep it alive.’ Converts toSankofa frequently quote this exhortation as evidence that traditional culture isendangered by modern times. Mr Aboah, a policeman who could often be foundat the compound, told me how it was necessary ‘to think good and be honest inyour thoughts . . . as the ancestors taught us . . . this will take us forward’. TheSankofa bird gazes wistfully at a cultural heritage of art, music and festivalscelebrating past national triumphs and memories. Inattention to custom leads,according to one prominent local Sankofa follower, ‘to laziness and carelessnessamong the young’. This has led to a desire to collect ‘Culture’, to preserve anddisplay it. ‘Culture’ is especially represented at the shrine that followers of Sankofa havebuilt in Amasu, a town in the Dormaa district. Resembling a Christian altar, tothe left of a small bowl is the Afrikania flag. To the right is the Ghanaiannational flag. The shrine constitutes a symbolic place which is both Ghanaianand African, a space of nationalism and virtue.Visitors to Amasu are encouraged by young aristocrats to visit the head-quarters of Sankofa in order to see for themselves how the shrine can play avital role in the creation of a better African future, a future that enablesAfrican Religion to compete on equal footing with the world religionsrepresented throughout Ghana. Upon arriving at the compound, visitors aregiven small glasses filled with gin in order to pour libation to the ancestors ofthe district. Here Ben told me:We should be proud of ourselves. . . the shrines allow us to retrieve the past. . . not useasuman. . . harm each other . . . God created the shrines to helpus make schools and teach us better ways to use our resources. The spirits atthe shrines are God's messengers and he wants us to prosper and bethoughtful.The old ways must be incorporated into the future. However, the active abosom-brafoshrines of the district, those visited to ward off evil and witchcraft, do notsymbolize the past in a way that such a project can usefully engage with. Theyare simply not the ‘right type’ of pre-modern religious phenomena. A sense of tradition can evolve out of a cosmopolitan knowledge that embracesan orientation towards the future but that nevertheless goes along with aconcern for building respect for the past and past generations. A further twist inthis contested terrain concerns the fact that in spite of the views of the old andnew elite, the young abosom-brafopriests at the shrines popular with themarketeers actually see their shrines as representing the most contemporarypowers of their gods as opposed to the demonized ways of the past. In the nextsection, I illustrate how their particular perception of the past has made someAnti-witchcraft among the Akan 129"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"young shrine-priests prepared to join forces with the young marketeers asopposed to the young aristocracy.Evil and misfortuneTwo of the youngest, and in one instance, most recently appointed shrine-priestsbelieve that their gods have a new potency. This is a power which derives fromthe powerful spirit of those gods who have with them a knowledge that travelsfrontiers, a knowledge that can be achieved by travelling outside of Ghana, sothat the far can come to be viewed from nearby, apart from national politics. Asone priest pointed out:The god who possesses me knows all about life today. He has travelled toLondon and Frankfurt. . . he can decide the cocoa price if he wishes . . . heis not like the other gods whose spirit has been attacked by witches and theofficials who work for the government . . . at this shrine we can makepowerful talismans and make them lose money.The young priests tell how there are people who will lie and bribe. Thesepeople, they suggest, have forgotten how the local gods fought for them andtheir ancestors. They have neglected the shrines and the gods at these shrines,bar their own, are weak. To be free of such people it is necessary to watch themfrom afar, like those gods, whose knowledge has grown. Their knowledge is up tothe minute and now stretches beyond Ghana’s borders. Misfortune is every-where, described one shrine-priest, because people wish ill on their rivals:There are too many bad thoughts . . . people no longer come to the shrinesand they kill one another...there is too much witchcraft . . . and the godsat the other shrines cannot fight it...the spirits are angry and they bringmisfortune . . . the spirits cause much trouble because people do not respecttheir wishes. We try to fight this because we understand how misfortune isworking . . . We understand economic and political ideals . . . the talismanswill guide you in this . . . the World Bank asks for our help.Likewise, several young marketeers draw analogies between these newer godsand the Silver Surfer, a figure from an American comic book. This comic wasdiscarded, only to be found by a marketeer, Rob, who kept it and told oneparticular shrine-priest about this character. The Silver Surfer, Norrin Radd, Ilater read, surrendered his freedom to become herald to the world-devouringGalactus in order to save his home planet, Zenn-La. The Surfer freely travelsthe vast universe. Possessed with cosmic power, he has the ability to channelenergy through his body and release it at will and watches the earth from space.Kofi told me that the god at one particular shrine he visits soon realized that,like the Silver Surfer, his motives would never be comprehended by his enemies:130 Jane Parish"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"At this shrine the god knows about very new things which happen onlytoday in Africa. He will make you a talisman so that you invest your moneywisely . . . he knows about. . . currencies and. . . invests money . . . heknows about very fine opportunities . . . my uncle he says . . . no . . . he justtake your money . . . my uncle. . . no way . . . he understands how to makehis women love him like mine do . . . he is stuck . . . the Silver Surfer he ispowerful . . . so is this god...the old people they do not understand thatthey are trying to help us and make us strong so that our spirit can over-come misfortune and all the problems in the world.The Silver Surfer, therefore, like the god, has an overview of events, but heremains misunderstood by the nations of the earth who believe that he still worksfor Galactus; also, like the shrine-gods, he seeks to conceal his own corruption.Talismans and the free marketInterestingly, the talismans bought by the marketeers to protect themselves fromwitchcraft and to make themselves rich differ from the talismans sold to tourists.In the eyes of one marketeer, Michael, the latter fetish bore little resemblance tothe type of sumanhe used to protect his wealth from witches, although he foundit difficult to pinpoint why:No, No, No . . . it does not work . . . not like mine. The American buys itto move closer to God. . . It is not the real sunsum. Why?...the ingredientsare mixed in a difficult way . . . the abosom would not listen to . . . bepleased with . . . (laughter) . . . maybe special mixture has been left out. . .maybe this does not matter because the American has not the same worriesas me . . . It is not essential to them . . . They do not believe in the witch-craft...means nothing to them . . . they do not fear it. I treat it with respect. . . it worries me.In seeking a remedy to the evil and misfortune that shrine-clients hope to over-come, some shrine-priests fashion powerful talismans which combine a mixtureof natural ‘bush’ matter with bits of western commodities. Continuity with thepast comes from the notion that powerful talismans are associated with spiritualsources found in the bush such as plants and bits of animal horn which the godinstructs the shrine-priest to collect. These natural ingredients are often fastened to ‘foreign’ objects, such asballpoint pens, and made sacred by the priest who injects them with ‘specialingredients’ only known about by the shrine god. These talismans are wornabout the body in order to bring the wearer good fortune and protect him or herfrom evil magic and medicine used by one’s enemies. Talismans fuse the powerof the local and the global in a deliberate mixture of material categories. Thelocal assumption is that all natural matter is animated. This means that evenAnti-witchcraft among the Akan 131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"the most exotic objects can be appropriated and made effectively local byrefashioning and attributing ‘local’ asunsum to them.Thus, of particular interest to the young marketeers are those objects obtainedfrom rich businessmen and foreign tourists, their credit cards, American Express,for example. The asuman(talismans) fastened by young marketeers to AmericanExpress plastic gives the purchaser, it is believed, the power to overcome localenemies. It places the wearer in an international market place. It gives him thepower to operate successfully against hidden market mechanisms. The creditcard, the epitome of the modern global economy, will, for example, be plasteredwith herbs bought from a shrine-priest who has collected these from the bush inthe district, traditionally the dwelling place of the most African of mythicalcreatures, the sasa-bonsam, a monstrous shaped monkey. The power of the localmoral economy is injected into the global commodity. This can then be wornabout the person to protect against attack by witches who are thought to be con-fused by the invisible workings of the card. It also guarantees protection againstcorrupt state officials and businessmen who seek to manipulate the ‘local’ marketfor their own interests and try to prevent others from earning a successful living.To the young aristocrats, these ‘hybridized European’ charms do not carry thesame power as ‘authentic local’ ones. The global commodity in some way under-mines, in their view, the power of the ‘local’. Anthony, aged 30, put thissuccinctly:The white man takes it all . . . their commodities have their place . . . not inAfrican religion. This is a worshipping that has a long history. Do not ruinit and try to replace it with Christian ways of life. These credit cards carryno power at all. There is no god in them. The god has gone, and left us . . .anyhow . . . you confuse me...nosumanshould be sold . . . they are selfishpeople who buy these like the Europeans. Do not try to copy them.For the tourist, on the other hand, the ‘local’ fetish sold to them by marketeershas no value either spiritually or in the global marketplace. It is merely acheap memento. It is not easily recognizable and does not have the same inter-national value as African masks, wooden animals and Kente cloth. Likewise,global products dressed up as ‘authentic fetish’ also have no appeal. They are not‘local’ enough and as one tourist summed it up: ‘It has no roots!’ In thinkingabout talismans, their symbolic complexity has much to do with how competingvalues and sources of power come to be represented and confined in objects whichbear, for some, highly charged connotations and associations. Talismans arepieces cut out of, or extracted from, larger worlds of meaning and action. Theirtransformative power derives both from their association with these differentworlds and, sometimes, from forced conjuncture. The young marketeers or thearistocracy who speculate about these conjunctures are in different ways both cos-mopolitan. They reach out imaginatively to other places and times in contrastingattempts to represent their past and command their present and their futures.132 Jane Parish"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"ConclusionContradictory social opinions expressed by marketeers and young aristocratsabout the distinct role of anti-witchcraft shrines may be taken as illustrativeof schisms in the way development and the market place itself is interpreted.The continual vitality of anti-witchcraft shrines illustrates, above all, thesimultaneous existence of both cultural change and resistance. Young marketeersfashion talismans sold at shrines to resell to tourists in search of an authenticAfrica. More importantly, they also purchase spiritual protection for themselvesin the hope that this power may protect them from witchcraft and help them tosecure untold riches in the market economy. In appearance, the talismans mostspiritually valued by the marketeer would not appeal to the tourist because thesefetishes are made up either of herbs and plants which the Euro-American doesnot value, or of global brands which the Euro-American consumer does notassociate with an African sacredness, or both. However, for the young marketeer,the talisman he carries, attached to credit cards, the epitome of an international‘virtual’ currency, enables the wearer to overcome obstacles which are placed inhis way by an assortment of ex-lovers, corrupt businessmen and politiciansat home who abuse their privileged position. It also enables its wearer tocircumvent evil and, using the power of the anti-witchcraft shrine, exploit thefree market for his own ends. The young aristocrat wants to preserve an ‘African’ way of life at the shrine,free from the influence of both traditional African evils such as witchcraft andof western lifestyles which have no place in the African shrine of today.Ironically, this is also the kind of shrine which would appeal to the Euro-American tourist in search of African art purchases, though the aristocrat wouldnever entertain such an idea. For he wants to keep at bay the corruptingeconomic and moral influence of capitalism, a corruption epitomized by thegreed of the ‘racketeer’ who, as the aristocrats see it, uses the shrine for his ownselfish ends. Development, in his eyes, demands that the ‘traditional’ values mostassociated with the shrine such as respect and sharing are inscribed in the heartof the nation and that western immoral attitudes are kept at arms length if thecommunity at large is to enjoy prosperity. This project involves restoring theshrine to its former glory, dissociating it from African diabolicalization andmaking shrines a place where worshippers can communicate withOnyame, learnhow to be good to their neighbours, and enact the religious and culturaltraditions of a golden past.

Among the Tuareg people of theNiger Republic – a traditionally stratified, semi-nomadic, Muslim people, whospeak a Berber language – Tamajaq, so-called ‘witchcraft’ poses special problemsfor analysis and interpretation. Four types of power are often invoked to explainhuman social destiny: togerchet; tezma; ark echaghel; and al baraka. These powersoften overlap, they are disputed in everyday practice, and have been trans-formed by recent socioeconomic and political turmoil.2The Tamajaq terms haveonly approximate translations in English. Togerchetdenotes approximately ‘evilmouth’ or ‘evil eye’ (Nicolaisen 1961; Rasmussen 2001; Casajus 2000). Tezmamost closely approaches classical anthropological definitions of ‘witchcraft’(Douglas 1966, 1992), referring to a force unintentionally activated when arequest for a gift, compensation, or pay is rejected; this usually involves conflictbetween a smith/artisan and a noble. Occasionally, however, nobles may activatethis power. (Ark) echaghel, literally ‘bad work’, is often translated by localspeakers into French as la sorcellerie, sorcery in English. Finally, al baraka, thepower most widely described in the ethnographic literature of North Africa(Westermarck 1926; Gellner 1969; Norris 1990), refers to Islamic blessing orbenediction, possessed primarily by Islamic scholars popularly called maraboutsand by some respected elders, herbalists, and chiefs. It is particularly powerful inthose maraboutique clans called icherifan, who claim descent from the Prophetand are credited with healing powers. Yet sometimes, local residents insist, albarakacan be misused and become corrupted, used to destroy, even kill. Thesenegative transformations ofal barakahave received less attention.These forces are complex and defy conventional binaries and glosses. Likethe more familiar English concepts of ‘jinxed’ situations or objects, or personscalled ‘Svengali-like’, ‘losers’, or ‘accident-prone’, the Tuareg forces should notChapter 7Betrayal or affirmation?Transformations in witchcraft technologiesof power, danger and agency among theTuareg of Niger1Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"be overly-mystified or exoticized. They include very human, social, as well asspiritual agencies, and they straddle both sacred and secular domains (theselatter not neatly separated). These four powers involve diverse agents, victims,and beneficiaries. Two of them – togerchetand (ark)echaghel– are generalized,and may apply (in agent and victim) to anyone. The other two – tezmaandal baraka– tend to be more class-specific. Three powers are believed to causeprimarily misfortune and ill luck; whereas the fourth, al baraka, similar thoughnot identical to the Polynesian mana, usually brings good fortune through associa-tion with a benevolent leader. Yet al barakacan be misused and in fact, sometimesbecomes converted into (ark)echaghel. Finally, while these forces are frequentlyinvoked, local cultural concepts of personal destiny are not strictly ‘fatalistic’.Many situations are attributed to the vagaries of nature or individual humanfrailties (Nicolaisen 1961; Rasmussen 1989, 1992, 1998, 2001; Spittler 1993). Still, these ‘mystic’ powers are important. A comparative analysis of themsheds light upon anthropological studies of witchcraft and, more broadly, theoriesof causation and destiny in ‘other modernities’ (Geschiere 1997; Ciekawy andGeschiere 1998; Douglas 1966, 1992; Comaroff and Comaroff 1999). In myview, many recent studies, while correct in emphasizing wider political economyand historic factors, still need to account for witchcraft as a moral, philosophicalforce. Tuareg idioms of ‘witchcraft’ reveal how, among Tuareg as among manyother Africans, the ‘traditional’ and the ‘modern’ are not so neatly opposed, anddo not replace each other (Martin and O’Meara 1995; Hutchinson 1996;Comaroff and Comaroff 1993, 1999); rather, they coexist and continually informeach other. So-called ‘modernity’ is a very slippery, relative term, often distinctfrom Euro-American concepts of power, statehood, and ‘development’ in itscross-cultural formulations. In many parts of Africa, witchcraft is explicitly linked to home and family(Ciekawy and Geschiere 1998: 4). Witchcraft has been described as the ‘darkside of kinship . . . inherent in the kinship order but is at same time a betrayalof its boundaries’ (Ciekawy and Geschiere 1998: 5). Among the Tuareg, itis often linked to threatening outsiders. In the Air Mountains of northernNiger, ‘witchcraft’ is the inversion of the stratified social order. It addresses thebetrayal of socioeconomic boundaries and local trust in the traditional keepersand guardians of these boundaries, mediators and buffers who normally protect.For example, smith/artisans and nobles are ideally mutually supportive andsymbiotic in their traditionally fictive kin-based, balanced and reciprocalclient–patron relations; Islamic scholars (calledineslemenor marabouts) areideally benevolent toward their trusting believer/followers; youths should obeyor at least respect elder leadership; and husbands and wives are supposed to loveand support each other. The invoking of mystic powers expresses concern withthe undermining of traditional safeguards in social relationships, the selectivityand limitations of economic opportunities, and the differential enjoyment ofbenefits (Taussig 1980; Rowlands and Warnier 1988; Geschiere 1997; Englund1996; Masquelier 1999).Power, danger and agency among the Tuareg 137"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Understanding witchcraft in relation to political economy still requiresgrappling with the problem of translation (Middleton 1960; Crick 1976;Beidelman 1993; Rasmussen 1992, 1998; Englund 1996; Bongmba 1998: 167).Use of both indigenous terms and non-indigenous terms, while never an exacttranslation, will facilitate understanding the phenomenon and situate it morewithin Tuareg, than Euro-American experiences of modernity (Englund andLeach 2000; Ferguson 1999). In this chapter, I show how Tuareg patterns ofaccusation of ritual powers and attributions of agency reflect social and economicturmoil: the breakdown of the pre-colonial stratified hierarchical system ofnobles, tributaries, smith/artisans, and former slaves, the questioning of impor-tant cultural values in conduct between youths and elders and men and women.Many Air Tuareg are pressured to sedentarize by ecological disasters: irregularrains, diminishing pastures – and by colonial and postcolonial state policies.They also face political tensions and intermittent armed conflict with thecentral government.3There are disruptions in property balance, and materialand spiritual resources. ‘Witchcraft’ accusations reflect enduring but contestedcultural values: namely, respect, reserve, sharing and giving, obedience, restraintin eating, verbal reticence, and caution in praise. Thus in analysing these ritualpowers of togerchet, tezma, echaghel, and al baraka, one must look to pressures inthe contemporary socioeconomic system where wealth and descent no longercoincide exactly, and where the bases of prestige and status – for nobles, smiths,former tributary and servile men and women, marabouts, and elders and youths– are increasingly fluid, and these traditionally-distinct powers, particularly albarakaand tezma, are not stable or diametrically opposed in every context, butacquire new meanings and uses.Socioeconomic turmoil, powers, and dangers among the TuaregIn Niger as across the African continent, there has been a growing exposure tofree market economics, privatization, and creation of small and medium-scaleenterprises, all in the name of ‘development’ and ‘re-structuring’ (Ndegwa andStryker 1995; Geschiere 1997; Sanders, Chapter 8). ‘Witchcraft’ powers illustratelocal perceptions of these processes and ways of coping with them, therebyrevealing local idioms of so-called ‘development’, and how such idioms shapepeople’s lived-in worlds in specific locales, but also how people actively respondto them. Interpersonal tensions are rooted in changing economic, political, andsocial conditions. Many rural Tuareg remain semi-nomadic, and continue topractise oasis gardening, herding, artisan work, and trading of salt, dates,and millet on caravans to Nigeria. Traditionally, occupations corresponded toinherited social status (of noble, tributary, smith/artisan, and former slave).Noble descent groups or clans wielded military domination over their client andformerly-servile populations.4The more nomadic pastoralist nobles collectedtribute from the subjugated oasis populations, peoples of various degrees ofservitude performed domestic, herding, and caravan labour for noble owners,138 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"tributaries raided and traded for nobles, and smith/artisans provided nobles withgoods and services, with specific client–patron rights and obligations.It is now difficult to live on nomadic stockbreeding alone, in the faceof recurrent droughts and increasing monetarization. Nowadays, persons ofdiverse social origins practise occupations formerly associated with one oranother social stratum, as well as new occupations of tourism, men’s migrantlabour, and itinerant trade of artisan products. In some Tuareg groups, despiteofficial social stratum endogamy, there has been long-standing intermarriagebetween nobles and former slaves (Rodd 1926; Bernus 1981). Smiths remain themost endogamous. Although they ideally share a joking relationship with smithsas fictive cousins, most nobles still abhor marrying smiths because of lingeringpollution beliefs. Many individuals still appeal to noble origins to justify certainconduct, chiefly noble and maraboutique clans attempt to arrange endogamous,politically-advantageous marriages between close cousins, and appeal to Islam inattempts to preserve traditional social prestige in the face of impoverishmentfrom drought and danger from armed conflict.5There is sometimes, moreover,competition among marabout/Islamic scholars for influence within thecommunity, and conflict between traditional and emergent leaders and eldersand youths.6There are now upheavals in patterns of production, wealth, andconsumption. Song verses, for example, lament that former slaves ‘come and dowhat they want’, warn against jealousy, gossip over success, and theft of property.Women criticize men for returning from migrant labour without money orpresents for their families (Rasmussen 1995). In the Air countryside, smiths continue to manufacture silver jewellery andleather, wooden, and stone tools for their patron nobles, assist in arrangingnobles’ marriages, act as ‘ambassadors’ for chiefs, and serve food and sing praise-songs at their nobles’ rites of passage.7The traditionally symbiotic relationsbetween nobles and smiths are now becoming more asymmetric, however. Ruralnobles still depend upon smiths as a group for many goods and services; whereassmiths have alternate sources of patronage and income in the tourist trade.Many rural smiths today also practise oasis gardening, herding, and tailoring, aswell as their traditional work of forge and rites of passage services. Until recently,many nobles were more reluctant to take up gardening and tailoring because ofthe traditional stigma of manual labour associated with them. In client–patronrelationships in the countryside, smiths’ work for nobles is remunerated in somecombination of money, food, and tea. But nobles are now having more difficultysupporting smiths. Some nobles resent some smiths’ economic success. Islamic scholars act as scribes, healers, and legal adjudicators. Nobles requirethe blessing of marabouts’ amulets and Qur’anic formulae before any dangerousundertaking (formerly raids, today caravanning, well-digging for oasis gardening,migrant labour, and most recently, the 1990–1995 Tuareg nationalist/separatistrebellion). Marabouts’ amulets also protect against theft and togerchetpowers ofevil eye and evil mouth. Marabouts nowadays acquire animals through religiousalms donations, in hospitality arrangements, and by ritual treatments requiringPower, danger and agency among the Tuareg 139"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"animal sacrifice. One source of marabouts’ income is a religious tax, called zakat,paid for by all who worship at the local mosque (Keenan 1977: 166; Spittler1993). Marabouts ideally act as ‘men of peace’ and, like smith/artisans, shouldact as mediators and refrain from fighting. Recently, however, there are hints ofgreater political activity among marabouts in two arenas: during the 1990–1995Tuareg Rebellion, when their amulets against bullets were in great demand byrebel fighters, and recently during greater assertion, in the towns of Niger, byIslamic reform movements.Cultural values of nobles emphasize dignity, reserve, respect/shame, andrestraint from too-open or loquacious speech. Deeds are closely connected towords. The spoken word is a topic of great concern. Tangalt, which denotes‘shadowy’ or indirect speech by allusion, metaphor, or symbol, is emphasized bynobles, both for politeness and for protection from vulnerability to misfortune(Casajus 2000: 32). In local attitudes toward destiny and causation, God orAllah is eternal, all-powerful, and good, but also punishes and condemns. Someinexplicable conditions, such as blindness without any discernible illness cause,are explained as the result of past sins. Other types of personal destiny areexplained as caused by the actions of spirits, Qur’anic and non-Qur’anic, whooften attack persons who become vulnerable during isolation in remote places(also metaphorically, in psycho-social loneliness and nostalgia) or duringtransitions (Nicolaisen 1961; Casajus 1987; Rasmussen 1995, 1997). The contexts of these ‘witch’-like powers are therefore complex. There areeconomic and ecological upheavals, as well as changing ideas about reproductionand production that place stress upon new wealth flows and forms of redistri-bution, yet there are some efforts to retain the older bases of power. New notionsand practices of modernity and power affect Tuareg of different social originsin contrasting ways. In Niger until recently, the northern regions were notintegrated into wider political or economic infrastructures, and Tuareg tended tobe underrepresented in decision-making and benefits. Many Tuareg initiallyresisted colonial and postcolonial secular schools, regarding them as strategies toforce them to sedentarize, and abandon local language and culture. Frenchcolonial policies tended to favour the interests of the southern regions and thefarming peoples (Fugelstad 1983; Decalo 1996). There have been efforts to correctthese regional disparities. Following the Tuareg nationalist/separatist rebellion,the terms of the 1995 Peace Pact have brought more aid organizations intonorthern regions and efforts to repatriate Tuareg, for example, integrate them intothe army and government. Yet there remain problems throughout Niger: of privat-ization, unemployment, social ‘banditry’, and sporadic armed conflict betweenmilitia and former rebels. In the following sections, I argue that, while it is truethat global forces trespass on local worlds, these local worlds also actively resist,re-fashion, and re-interpret global intrusions. The challenge for anthropologistsnow is to convey these processes in their full complexity. This task requiresethnographic portrayals that retain the depth and intimacy of small-scalecommunity studies, but also address wider forces intruding into the local terrain.140 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Four ritual powers among the Tuareg‘Evil eye/mouth’(Togerchet)Togerchetconveys the idea that back-biting gossip, as well as praises from envyor complacency, can wound people and animals. I was often struck by its effectupon ethnographic field research. While I, as anthropologist, continually soughtclarification and precision in verbal descriptions, local cultural values oftenemphasized verbal restraint and caution due to fear of togerchet, which appears tooutsiders as evasion or vagueness. For example, one is cautious about praisesaddressed to others’ families or animals. Once, when I returned from the homeof a sick baby I had treated with an anti-dehydration remedy for diarrhoea, Iannounced to my field hostess with satisfaction, that the baby was now better.She cautioned me that it is safe to say ‘This baby is beautiful’, but not ‘This babyis healthy’, when a baby is cured of an illness, because the latter stimulatestogerchetand may cause the baby to relapse and die. Friends constantly warnedme against revealing my true desires, preferences, and goals. For example, a fieldassistant explained to me, after we had eaten several dates, that, ‘if someonewith togerchetsees how many date pits you leave and gossips about how muchyou eat, this gives you a toothache’. Key themes here are envy, desire, prolifer-ation of words, news, and opinions, flaunting of belongings, open eating, andtensions between sharing and hoarding. Togerchethas to do with perceived greedand hoarding, not sharing belongings, especially food. One should be very little inclined to speak about what one does oneself. Ahunter who prepares to leave on the hunt does not tell anyone, for if others seehim leave and speak to him about it, the success of his hunt will be compromised(Nicolaisen 1961: 134). Once during a visit, conversation turned to my ownwork in anthropology and ethnography. Suddenly, a friend who had accompaniedme stood up, and rather abruptly announced our departure. En route home, heexpressed worry that I had begun ‘to reveal the secrets of my life’ to the womanwe had visited. In another incident, while I was photographing a spirit possessionritual, my camera shutter stuck suddenly. I attributed this to the wind and sand,ubiquitous in the Sahara, but several women friends insisted that this was causedby the togerchet(or more generally, awal, denoting speech in general) emanatingfrom negative gossip by several persons present at the ritual. Although I hadrequested and received permission to take these photographs, there were somepersons there who perhaps coveted this new item of technology, then stillconsidered a luxury, rarer than audio-recorders in the region. Some cameracases, moreover, resembled gun-holsters. They evoked unpleasant memories ofattacks when Air villages were caught in the middle of battles between militia,separatist rebels, and ‘bandits’.These incidents and commentaries suggest the importance of verbal restraint:as with men’s veiling of the face, nobles, especially, must follow the shadowydetours of indirect speech by allusion, especially in praise.

Often at stake in togerchetwarnings are wider concerns with property andsuccess. One smith/artisan man, whom I will call Mounkaila, was born to thewest of Agadez in a small nomadic camp, where he began the work of the forgefor nobles at an early age. Later on he attended school in Agadez. He was brightand talented, and assisted a French ethnographer in the Agadez region, collabor-ating on a book. He also continued to manufacture beautiful Tuareg silverjewellery, and went to France to participate in artisan fairs. He was awarded aprize for a necklace he had made. His jewellery became popular with bothTuareg and Europeans, and he established a store in Niamey, the capital city. Healso acted as a liaison in arranging for a fashion show to come to Agadez. Thiswas highly publicized in newspapers, where models were photographed wearingostrich feather costumes for a French fashion magazine. In July 1999, Mounkailaand a business partner came to the United States, visiting New York, Washington,Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Houston, where they stayed in my home as guests.During their visit, they sold their jewellery and their wives’ leatherwork atHouston international fairs, import shops, and museums. When Mounkaila’s business partner returned to Houston in April 2000,however, he brought disturbing news. Mounkaila now suffered from a kind of‘mental block’, which prevented him from creating jewellery. He also feltdepressed, and his work declined. A marabout indicated that Mounkaila wassuffering from togerchet, activated by the jealousy of some other smiths over hisextraordinary success. The marabout made amulets for him from Qur'anic verses,and as of this writing, Mounkaila was feeling better and at work again.Not solely smiths, but also nobles, may experience togerchet, but severalhighly successful smiths have suffered from particularly acute cases of thisrecently. Togerchetin these contexts appears to be emerging as a counterbalanceto smiths’ traditional power of tezma. In the past, smiths were the ones whowere, reputedly at least, poor. As a smith man explained to me in the 1970s, ‘Imake jewellery for my noble women, but I do not wear it myself; I disdainjewellery. I do not imitate nobles, but (instead) I hover near them, buzzingaround like a fly; I am a kind of nobles’ journalist.’ By contrast, in 1998 a smithemployed by a noble to manufacture a wooden well pulley wore an elegantsilver-cased amulet around his neck, which the noble pointed out to medisapprovingly. There are hints here that smiths, in order to comment criticallyupon and mediate between noble social groups, cannot become too much likenobles. But nowadays, increasingly, smiths themselves accumulate property theywere once believed to covet from nobles. Indeed, everyone is vulnerable to togerchetunder certain circumstances: duringtransitions, for example, rites of passage, special precautions should be taken. Atthe name-day held for a third child by a noble man’s second wife, a maraboutwrote verses from the Qu’ran on a tablet, and the baby’s father washed it off forthe mother to drink to protect against togerchetfrom anyone there who might be142 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"jealous or resentful of the child and/or the mother. It was widely known that thisman’s first wife had been unhappy over his contracting of the second, polygynousmarriage.8Significantly, songs at name-days and weddings, settings of joyfulpraises and admiration, often contain verses repelling togerchet. Good fortuneand praise are desired, yet dangerous. Yet there is often no single diagnosis of misfortune. Disagreements revealconsiderable overlap between togerchetand other forces, for example, (ark)echaghel or ‘bad work’ (‘sorcery’). One woman of noble origins, married to aretired school supervisor, suddenly fell ill with aches in her ribs and a fever andvomiting. A clinic doctor diagnosed her with high blood pressure and heartproblems, and instructed her to get a series of shots. This woman took me asideand in hushed tones complained about additional problems: the togerchetgossipof some of her neighbours in the village, in a different descent group (tawsit),with whom her own had fought several years earlier. They hinted that her visitsto the distant clinic included trysts with a lover. Later, this woman was accusedby her husband of an extramarital affair with a smith/artisan man attached tonoble families of the old rival tawsit. Smith/artisan men are in principleforbidden as husbands or lovers, and permitted only to be friends and confidantsof noble women. Here, the force of togerchettargets the breaking of social stratum sexual taboos:illicit sexual relations between noble and smith, in an extramarital liaison. Thustogerchetremains, as traditionally, active in cases of greed and ostentatiousness:in the acquisition of too much food, too much wealth, too many wives on thepart of men, or too many (or inappropriate) lovers. But in this adultery case,there were new considerations: physical sexual taboos are traditionally intendedto channel property in appropriate directions, and to convert reproductiveenergy into productive property relations. These paths became diverted andreproduction was endangered by becoming detached from productive wealth.The connections between reproduction, wealth, and changing powers inmodernity are also shown in the interplay of togerchetwith other forces, forexample, echaghelor sorcery. For example, one couple’s marriage was threatenedby a pact with the spirits promising wealth. One year, the husband, Ibrahim(pseudonym), obtained a magic for becoming rich. In exchange, he had toslaughter a rooster each Friday, because the magic was a spirit bull thatnourished itself with its blood. If he did not do this, he would lose each child hiswife, Fatimata (pseudonym), gave birth to. Ibrahim at first followed these instruc-tions, but he eventually neglected to slaughter the rooster, and each time Fatimatagave birth to a child, as predicted, the child died. She sought a marabout’sprotection against her husband’s magic, and the marabout killed this bull withsorcery (echaghel). Ibrahim then lost his magic, and Fatimata went crazy. Laterhe became polygynous. One herbalist Fatimata consulted diagnosed her assuffering from Kel Essuf spirits, togerchet, and tuksi, a generic category of ‘hot’illness in the local counteractive medical system.9Fatimata’s son-in-law sacrificedan animal in the hope of curing her, and Fatimata also underwent the possessionPower, danger and agency among the Tuareg 143"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"ritual called tende n goumaten, whose possessing spirits are believed to be inheritedmatrilineally, transmitted through the mother’s milk.10Many local men explainedthis family’s misfortunes differently: they indicated that ‘some women in thatfamily have difficulty marrying because they cause men’s herds to die’. These disputes over power, causation, and agency address changing connec-tions between wealth and reproduction. Husbands and wives are caught inconflicts over ambiguous property ownership in recent sedentarization and men’smigrant labour. Over approximately the past seventy years, drought, colonialFrench and postcolonial Niger government policies, and aid ‘development’programmes have pressured many Air Tuareg to settle down, and practise oasisgardening more intensively. Many men have been constructing adobe mudhouses, which they own, next-door to their wives’ tents, and try to bring wivesto reside near husbands’ kin while husbands are absent on long-term new travel.(Whereas in the past, many men felt wives were better off near their own kinwhile men went on the traditional caravan trade 5–6 months a year.) Many menhave also constructed adobe houses. In more sedentarized communities, manymen at first reside in their wife’s nuptial tent near her parents, according totraditional custom, but later attempt to bring wives with them, preferably farfrom wives’ parents’ compound. Although Tuareg women retain the tent, andthe right to eject the husband upon divorce, with these houses, men no longerfear being homeless.There are additional marriage-related tensions. Polygyny, while still notprevalent among most Tuareg men, is becoming more common in semi-sedentarized communities among some chiefs, marabouts, prosperous gardeners,and merchants. Motives include men’s seeking of new, wider political andeconomic alliances and different homes in their diverse places of work, andsometimes, also, younger wives to bear more children to assist with gardeningtasks (Rasmussen 1997). Most gardens are owned by men; whereas women andmen both traditionally own livestock animals. Many women now feel greaterpressure to bear more children men insist they need in greater numbers, to assistwith oasis gardening. Whereas by contrast, in the old, more pastoral nomadiceconomy, births were spaced: it was shameful to have another child when theyoungest child was under 3 years old. Now, many women fear their husband willbecome polygynous unless they fulfil these increased demands of fertility. Femaleherbalists believe many fertility problems and birth defects are caused by amother’s anger while pregnant (tourgoum). Other women believe that Kel Essufspirits may prevent children or cause their deaths. By contrast, in many malemarabouts’ viewpoint, ‘only God does these things’, or as some men say, ‘Somewomen themselves (in matrilineal transmission), pass down certain misfortunes’.Thus more children now signify greater wealth, whereas in the past, morelivestock herds – including some herds passed matrilineally through women –provided greater wealth and security for women. These forms of women’swealth, calledakhu huderan(‘living milk’ property), in effect become symbolicallyinverted, and converted by some men in their comments regarding ‘dangerous’144 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"women, into ‘misfortunes for men’. Moreover, many postcolonial state legalarrangements now tend to position women as wards of men. For example, postaladdresses in Niger refer to women as ‘Madame + name of husband’, school andclinic records refer to women with the surnames of their father, and houses areregistered in the names of husbands.11Ibrahim’s new source of wealth, won and then lost, brings to light additionalconnections between witchcraft accusations, wealth, and sharing. Ibrahim,Fatimata’s husband, was supposed to give offerings to his tutelary spirit, but hereneged on this obligation. Spirit pacts should be used to benefit others, notsolely to enrich the individual. Togerchetis associated with pollution in food,sex, and medicine that threatens bodily and social boundaries, but these are notstatic or fixed. Moreover, togerchetand the more smith-specific power of tezmawere traditionally somewhat complementary to each other, counterbalancingand reinforcing ideally reciprocal social relations between nobles and smiths.Now togerchetpower increasingly expresses the newly problematic boundaries –of gender and social stratum and newly emergent class relations within andbeyond the household – in the changing moral and social system: namely,boundaries between technologies of good and evil (e.g. cameras can resembleguns); between persons (nobles and smiths, husbands and wives, and membersof different descent groups), as well as between substances (spirit pacts andQur’anic verses may be either protective, or become poisons or burdens). Smiths’ mystic powers (tezma)Tezmaattacks a region of the stomach through the orifices, and is manifestedby a swelling of the stomach, often fatal among children and animals. Whileevil mouth or eye comes from conscious envy or desire, the force of tezmacomesfrom a smith, allegedly unconsciously, in automatic punishment if one does notgive one’s surplus or justly compensate for services rendered. Nonetheless,smiths are blamed (Nicolaisen 1961: 136). In the countryside, smiths may stillask for or merely see something they wish for, even outside ritual and technicalwork situations, and nobles should give to smiths. Violence against smiths istraditionally rare because they are a protected people, nobles’ fictive cousins,against whom it is not appropriate to express anger without denigrating oneself(Rasmussen 1992). Recently, however, there are signs of increasing socialtensions between some nobles and smiths. While some nobles and smiths arebecoming business partners, many are rivals in an economic system whererewards are scarce, and some nobles view smiths’ work for tourists as a distractionfrom their traditional duties toward nobles (Rasmussen 1998). Accusations ofsexual transgressions and pollution appear as a kind of metonymy for otherconcerns. As shown in the case of alleged adultery between the noble womanand the smith man, alleged sexual offences figure in many of these tensions. Inanother incident, a smith man was accused of starting a ring of prostitution, andof engaging a young noble women in this for his own profit, in one ruralPower, danger and agency among the Tuareg 145"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"community. Local residents reported that such organized prostitution had neverexisted in the countryside before, only in the towns. Outraged, they flogged him,and ejected him from the community.Thus there is a changing political economy of wealth and of perceptions ofvalue. Some smiths are apparently sexually successful (or feared to become so)with the wives and daughters of their traditional noble patrons, now that theformer have greater access to wealth by selling jewellery to tourists and are nolonger so dependent upon noble patronage. But how do smiths themselves viewthis tezmapower and its extensions into current conflicts? Two elderly smiths Iquestioned explained, ‘there is a verse of the Qur’an that cures illness caused bytezma, which marabouts can read’. Many also indicated that, related to belief intezmais smiths’ lack of reserve; the reason for this is ‘so that they may acceptcompensation (remuneration) from nobles for their work, and therefore smithsand nobles must be kept separate. Smiths need this protection, in order topractise their work and receive compensation.’ Tezma, in other words, comesfrom smiths’ ideal lack of reserve in feeling free to ask nobles for goods, and fromnobles’ ideal reserve and hesitation to ask for something because of valuesemphasizing dignity and indirect speech as crucial to noble identity; it in effectvalidates client–patron roles and relationships. But these values are now moredifficult for both parties to maintain, when many nobles find themselves inneed, and many smiths are finding a new economic niche. Indeed, on rareoccasions, nobles allegedly activate tezma, and this is believed stronger than thatof smiths. According to two elderly smith men, however, ‘With some people,[smiths’] tezmais so strong a belief, that if a smith comes even for a short time, ifhe leaves (without doing anything), they are going to say that he did tezma’.One smith woman apparently experienced this ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ whenshe was accused of tezmaby one of her noble patron woman’s daughters, whofell ill after the smith woman had asked for and been refused sugar at this house-hold. The smith woman cried and vehemently denied this, but her client–patronrelationship with this family was broken. The breakdown was somewhatdisadvantageous for this smith woman, for several reasons. Most smith womenhave fewer alternative sources of income or customers than smith men in the newtourist trade, where there is greater demand for men’s silver and gold jewellerythan women’s leatherwork. Although this woman was a popular praise-singer, animportant role in the countryside, she was somewhat more impoverished thansome other smiths. Furthermore, rather than marrying a close cousin accordingto the usual smith custom, this woman had married a former slave man.Although the couple were now divorced, marriage to a former slave is lessstigmatized than in the past, and divorce does not bring any stigma to women,this smith woman had also broken a sexual taboo: she had two illegitimatechildren, disapproved of in Tuareg society despite tolerance of some pre-maritalaffairs. Thus this woman’s alleged tezmaseems to have been reinforced by hermore general marginality in the community at a time of heightened tensions,when some search for scapegoats.146 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"I was frequently warned about smiths’ alleged tezma, and advised to complywith their requests. On one occasion, my hosts surmised that I caught tezmafrom a smith man who was reputed to have particularly strong powers, in apuzzlingly violent but brief cold and fever I had suffered while I was staying inhis village (see Figure 7.1). I had experienced an intense night sweat and smelledan odd odour, but these had vanished suddenly overnight. My hosts explainedthat, because I gave him food belatedly after he came by, the tezmahad suddenlyleft me. Another friend believed this tezmawas cast upon me by another, elderlysmith man who had requested eye ointment from me, but whom I had to refusereluctantly because I had left the remedy behind, in a distant village. Expatriatesare replacing nobles in some contexts, in local client–patron relationships(Rasmussen 1998). Indeed, some Tuareg artisans in Niamey, the capital city, arenow working for French entrepreneurs in artisan workshops. Relevant here arewider policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Africa,which have imposed austerity measures and pressured the Niger economytoward privatization. While ostensibly ‘cost-cutting’, these measures have actuallycreated unemployment, delay of salaries, devaluation of local currency (the WestAfrican CFA) by 50 per cent, and caused shortages of medicines (Rasmussen2001). These conditions, as well as the intermittent violence of armed conflictsin the northern region, have forced men into more distant and prolongedmigrant labour than previous travel (caravans, raids) required.

Disputed interpretations and changingoutcomes of tezmaaccusations reflect upheavals in these relationships. ‘Bad work’ or ‘sorcery’(ark echaghel)Ark echaghel, or what some ethnographers call ‘black magic’ (Nicolaisen 1961:137), is considered a terrible force, sufficient to kill even from a distance.Some outsiders are believed to have this malevolent power, for example, somefamilies of Tubu origins, called Ikarkawen, former slaves of the Kel Geres con-federation of Tuareg, are believed to cause and cure this. Echaghelis thusattributed to persons slightly more distant than the perpetrators of togerchetortezma. Echaghelactivation, however, requires the services of an expert, who knowsthe principal ingredients and methods of administration. The base ingredientsare either fed to the intended victim, or thrown on the ground where he/she willtread. Al barakacan also come hand-in-hand with echaghel, and their boundaries– as friend and foe of the afflicted person – are by no means clearly demarcated.Thus social ties may be either affirmed or betrayed by this same power.One smith/artisan man, whom I’ll call Tafa, had been married for severalyears to a close cousin who resided in a neighbouring village where the coupleresided uxorilocally. Tafa had been ill for three years with a stomach ache (onesymptom of either togerchet, tezma,or sorcery – depending upon the context anddiagnosis), body aches, ‘craziness’ apparently resembling our own notion of‘panic attacks’, and also alleged spirit problems ‘of the head’. Various diagnos-ticians disagreed, however, on the relative severity and primacy of these afflictionsas causes of his malaise. Tafa initially saw marabouts, who diagnosed throughQur’anic divination a case of possessing spirits, but did not cure him. Tafa nextsaw a famous elderly female herbalist. She thought his mind was ‘touched’. Also,she diagnosed him as having a ‘hot’ (inflammatory) illness called tuksi. This, shesaid, came about when he ingested too much marabout vegetal ink medicine,but she conceded that he also had spirits called eljenan. Tafa’s most prominentsymptom was fear. The herbalist said this meant he was also the victim of sorcery:she diagnosed this when she touched his head, which had become diminished.This also caused him to be restless. The herbalist commented that ‘It is necessaryto do marabout medicine in stages, gradually, not too fast; and also, one needs totrust a single marabout in this’. Tafa finally saw a male non-Qur'anic divinercalled a boka. Tafa credited both the bokaand the herbalist with having curedhim, but the diviner insisted that he had chased his spirits away. The divinerdivined with cowry shells, and said that a black spirit had struck Tafa on his waywalking home, causing his feet to become heavy and making him collapse to hisknees. In order to reinforce the cure for this, people must neither greet nor askabout the patient for fourteen days of the cure, from fear of togerchet. Several months prior to his symptoms, Tafa had unwittingly accepted stolengoods from thieves from Mount Bagzan, and sold them in his store in his natal148 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"village. He had experienced some trouble with the police afterward. But thebokareassured him that all this was not his fault. He stated: ‘Spirits can attackat random, like a thief; they can ask something of someone and kill him. Youdid not do anything bad to bring on your illness, you merely encountered a spiritat random, like a thief. For example, if goats go into the wild, the jackal cancatch any goat by chance.’ After fourteen days of treatment with the boka’s treemedicines, Tafa felt better, but still rested at the home of a male cousin andavoided his store which, since his illness, had been closed. Tafa had begunstudying maraboutage, but did not yet practise it, although he had ambitionsin this specialty and wrote verses at home. He and his wife had not yet becomeindependent or moved away from this uxorilocal residence.12Tafa’s economicsituation was thus rather precarious. Professional rivalry over Qur'anic studymay also enter into this case. There were hints that Tafa had overextended him-self in Qur'anic studies and perhaps, attempted to claim too much competencefor someone at his level of study. One prominent marabout in the regionindicated to me that ‘a truly great marabout should not seek glory; he is ideally amagnet for, or reflection of God’. There is often competition among holy menfor followings (Gellner 1969), and concentrations of al barakamay be therebyconverted into accusations of sorcery.In this case, therefore, the sources of illness and cure and their boundaries arein dispute. There are hints that Qur’anic medicine can itself become poison orillness, if improperly used. Perhaps there was rivalry over the practice of mara-boutism involving Tafa, or perhaps his potential for developing al barakabecamepolluted by his great ambition or his contact (however inadvertent) with thethieves, causing him much psycho-social stress. In the currently uncertainpolitics of the semi-autonomous northern region and more general unemploy-ment and breakdown of security throughout Niger, some former fighters in theTuareg Rebellion and other disaffected youths have turned to ‘social banditry’.As with the boundaries of social agents, the boundaries of ritual powers andtheir agents are not clear-cut (Rasmussen 2001).Highlighted in the foregoing material are connections between sorcery andIslamic scholars/marabouts. For sorcery to have a truly successful, fatal effect,the help of a marabout is imperative (Nicolaisen 1961: 137). Also required isthe use of written, not solely oral words, in the form of curses drawn from versesof the Qur’an, or formulas of incantation drawn from Arabic manuals on magic.Thus al barakais not always rigidly opposed to echaghel, and the targets, agents,and interpretations of these powers are being re-formulated in current politicaland economic upheavals. A marabout can practise sorcery either in order toavenge himself against someone, or upon demand from a third party. One friendin Agadez related to me an incident involving a noble man who was a renowneddancer in a cultural exchange troupe due to go to France for a performance. Butthis man loved the same woman a marabout loved. The marabout becamejealous of him, so he activated a form of echaghelthat caused his teeth to sinkinto his leg and wound it, and thus he was debilitated and could not go toPower, danger and agency among the Tuareg 149"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"perform with the dance troupe in France. Marabouts, ideally benevolent,nonetheless occupy a curious position among the Tuareg. Since medieval Tuaregnobles initially resisted Islam and valued valour in war, some compromise wasnecessary in the social system: the only sacerdotal class was confronted by moraldilemmas, and had to provide standards to transform a warlike society (Norris1975: 20–21). Today in Air, marabouts are generally honoured for their wisdomand their al baraka, but also feared for their capability of using their knowledgein sorcery, or in other unexpected ways. Hence the ambiguity and indeterminacyof marabouts’ al barakapower.Marabouts’ Islamic blessing or benediction (al baraka)That life force, blessing, and benediction called al baraka, believed to beconcentrated in prominent marabouts and chiefs, is therefore complex. Norris(1990: 167) defines (al)barakaas ‘a divine blessing or grace bestowed upon Sufisin holy places, in their communal meals, in prayer from a specific and reveredShaykh, and also from the discarded khirqa(ritual Sufi) mantle’. The icherifannobles who claim descent from the Prophet seek to establish a rapport with theforce of al barakaand the chief of the clan also has this. Traditionally, thereexists a connection between the responsibility of chiefs concerning the fertilityof the country and their relation toal baraka. This applies particularly to theSultan of Air, the Amenokal in Agadez who, it is said, keeps bones of hisancestors as amulets. Everything that is living, that grows, that is good, containssome al baraka(Nicolaisen 1961; Rasmussen 1991). Even prestigious marabouts and icherifanwho possess al baraka, are stillsupposed to be obedient and modest, as servants of those they heal. Maraboutsmanufacture many amulets to protect against thieves: for example, one was onthe wall of an adobe house in the compound of my host family. It came fromNigeria, and was believed to cause a thief to lose his way. All these amulets aremade from forms of Qur'anic divination, done only for people the maraboutknows well, kin or like kin (see Figures 7.2 and 7.3). One marabout asked me ifI wasn’t afraid of local malevolent powers, and offered to make amulets for me.Ideally, therefore, ‘good’ marabouts make use of their al barakaas guardians ofthe local, ‘home’ cultural terrain. At night, marabouts’ tombs with al barakaarebelieved to become dangerous with evil spirits and attack passers-by withoutprotective metal, e.g. swords. Perhaps this belief is intended to discouragecertain forms of anti-social behaviour, for example, the breaking of sexual taboos(couples may fear having trysts there), or perhaps, it may discourage outsidersfrom wandering about the local terrain. But now this terrain is disputed andoften invaded. For example, one local chief and marabout forbade the cuttingdown of trees in a forest on Mount Bagzan, intending to benefit the localpopulations ultimately in preventing erosion, but some local herders resentedthis restriction, identifying it with a government agency called Eaux et Forets(Waters and Forests). 150 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"As guardians of sacred places in times of economic and ecological crisis, somemarabouts take a stand against what they view as dubious benefits of centralstate edicts, international aid programmes, and tourism agencies intruding intoAir. Following Niger’s independence, during difficult years of drought, somemarabouts’ powers to bring rain were marshalled, but also threatened. When anaid agency installed rain gauges one rainy season on the plateau summit ofMount Bagzan, the rains did not fall as expected. Local marabouts insisted thatit was these rain gauges that were causing the drought, by preventing the rainfrom falling. This veiled their fear of some political competition of outsideinfluences from these postcolonial central state authorities, in the form oftechnical aid. There was a conflict of modernities here: in effect, the maraboutssensed the competition for technological control, and possibly also for politicalpower from the aid agency, despite the general welcoming of some of its benefits.Perhaps in response to such fears, some marabouts are rumoured to bury ‘bad’sorcery amulets underground along some routes, to deter outsiders from enteringthe area. This was vividly shown during a dispute over when to begin tocelebrate Biannu, a celebration of renewal for the coming year. Its date of onsetis calculated by the lunar calendar, as are other Islamic holidays. One begins tocelebrate it upon confirmation, by marabouts, on their sighting of the moon.During the regime of Seyni Kountche (1974–1987), the then-president of Nigerdeclared that it was time to celebrate the holiday, that the moon had come. Theleader of the Air marabouts, however, disagreed, and refused to follow the centralPower, danger and agency among the Tuareg 151Figure 7.2A marabout man working with verses which he will insert into an amulet.(Photo by S.

Kountche sent several functionaries as representativesinto the region to initiate the celebration, but each time a car set out, there wasan accident and fatalities. Local residents insisted that this calamity was causedby the prominent marabout’sal barakaagainst Kountche. Subsequently, themarabout declared the sighting of the moon, thereby overriding, allegedly atleast, the late president’s declaration of when to start Biannu celebrations.These beliefs and incidents illustrate the transformations, but also continuities,in marabouts’al barakapowers during tensions between the northern Air regionand Niamey, the capital, the seat of central state and international aid agencyhegemonies. Marabouts, despite their traditional pacific roles, cannot avoidbecoming involved in political debates over the effects of aid policies. Inter-mittently, their al barakais drawn outward, and channelled into more contentious,outside upheavals, if not in ‘fact’, at least in ex post facto interpretations.Some marabouts are rumoured to manufacture amulets protecting againstbullets in the intermittent armed conflicts between some Tuareg separatists and152 Susan RasmussenFigure 7.3A child wearing special amulets which protect it against malevolent forces.(Photo by S.

One marabout, highlyesteemed for his amulets believed to protect rebels from militia bullets, had twosons who nonetheless obtained guns from a rebel front, and at first they resistedthe efforts after the Peace Pact to disarm. But many people believe that the(now former) rebel leaders, especially Rhissa Boula, have powerful maraboutiqueprotection against bullets. Following the Peace Pact, interestingly, the govern-ment appointed Rhissa Boula, formerly a rebel leader, as a minister. To someextent, this appointment was one measure fulfilling the terms of the Peace Pact:to integrate more Tuareg (heretofore minorities underrepresented in the nationalinfrastructure) into the militia and government and university. On anothermore unspoken, yet equally powerful, level, however, this leader’s allegedprotection by the al baraka-saturated amulets of prominent Air marabouts wasalso, surely, taken very seriously. Marabouts now publicly bless the politicalrallies of the Amana party, popular in the northern town of Agadez. Some marabouts are drawn into religious sectarian conflicts. Izala, an Islamicpuritanical-reformist sect, has gained some ground in Niger. There have beenseveral shootings in Agadez between marabouts recently. In August 1995, amarabout in Agadez was killed in an armed robbery. Prior to this, there wereonly rarely attacks on marabouts, ideally men of peace who, like smith/artisans,traditionally must not be the victims of aggression. Thus marabouts play roles innew forms of political economy, based upon longstanding and transformed ideasabout power and social relations.Conclusions: the interplay of ritual powers and social agencyBeliefs about alleged mystical powers reveal alternately competing, aligned,opposed, complementary, and overlapping social agents in different contexts.Even before recent upheavals and turmoil, the holders of ritual powers haveoften inverted the popular images of their powers (Rasmussen 1989, 1992). Insome contexts, marabouts’ powers are transformed into sorcery, particularly inpolitical resistance to outside intruders viewed as infidels. Smiths’ powers,despite their alleged danger, can also sometimes confer protection from spirits,for example, converting natural into cultural substances such as metals.Marabouts’ power, traditionally that of figurehead who pronounces the will ofofficial authority, addresses wider political concerns of the breakdown ofauthority. Smiths also still have access to indirect power, through their controlof unofficial negotiations surrounding marriage and their roles as political go-betweens and, increasingly today, also access to material wealth, whereas manynobles are becoming marginalized in the economic infrastructure. Yet therelationship between danger and opportunity is ambiguous. Tezmanow has theadded dimension of sexual pollution, and sometimes reverts back against theaccused smith perpetrator, rather than acting to his/her advantage as purely aneconomic levelling device, as in the past. Smith/artisans are becoming morePower, danger and agency among the Tuareg 153"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"victims of this themselves; rather than a source of control over nobles, it appearsto be converting into a source of danger for smiths (in more violent retaliation).Furthermore, as shown, some highly successful smiths are frequently afflictedwith togerchet, suggesting their loss of status as a traditionally protected people.Al barakais becoming more politicized in nation-state level violence, and alsoconverted more easily into ark echaghelto protect local cultural autonomyinterests. Yet the interpretation of al barakaappears to remain largely inmarabouts’ control; even cases of its conversion into alleged ark echaghelare notalways viewed as anti-social, provided they are perceived as benefiting thecommunity as a whole. On the other hand, when echaghel(or even al baraka) isassociated with selfish, individual gain, as in corruption of a spirit pact orcontamination by theft, it is believed to have dire consequences – in effect,‘blocking’ fertility of women, decimating livestock, and ruining business.More broadly, the four types of ritual powers among the Tuareg offer insightsinto processes of resistance and accommodation to historically momentoustrends in institution building. The Tuareg data suggest ways of investing morecomplex meanings to cultural forms assumed to be generated by responses tocapitalism (Taussig 1980; Willis 1981). Here, cultural forms arise from classpositions in an institutional order that is changing, but not in neatly predictableor unilinear fashion. Clifford and Marcus (1986: 178) correctly observe thatthere has been some anthropological bias toward emphasizing ‘pre-capitalist’dimensions of lives of ethnographic subjects. On the other hand, in my viewthere is also an equally problematic modernist bias in assuming that trans-nationalism and capitalism take the same form everywhere. Local culturalbeliefs and political economy continually inform each other, and small-scalecommunity studies add richness and depth to multi-sited ethnographies. Localnarratives of ritual power, agency, and causation show local residents’ creativityin the face of global changes. Yet local residents, in invoking these powers, arenot acting solely in response to modernist schemes. The effects of these changesare very uneven, and bring to light inconsistencies of ‘modernist’ schemes. Fromthis perspective, ‘global culture’ is a misnomer; there are only ‘global cultures’,in the plural.

Theseinvolve enforcing western-based concepts of free market conditions and loanrepayment, including for example, privatization, ‘democratization’ and curtailing of154 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"previous, more socialistic policies of some African governments of central planningand subsidies (see Sanders, Chapter 8). In Niger and elsewhere, many health-carebenefits have been cut, there is widespread unemployment, and the poor havesuffered most from these measures (Ndegwa and Stryker 1995). Additionally, Nigerhas been hard-hit by droughts (in 1969–1973, 1984, and 2000), and regional and‘ethnic’ conflicts. 3 From 1990 to 1995, some Tuareg groups in the northern regions of Niger and Maliwere embroiled in a nationalist/separatist armed conflict against the centralgovernments of these countries. In April 1995, a Peace Pact was signed inOuagadougou, Burkina Faso, but there have been numerous factions and sporadicmilitary confrontations in some regions. Some former fighters have been integratedinto the national infrastructure, for example, the army, but others have turned to‘banditry’ from the combined effects of political turmoil and economic structuraladjustments in Niger. Until recently, there were significant discrepancies in colonialand postcolonial ‘development’ policies in different regions of these countries, andwhile these often translated into ‘ethnic’ conflicts, in my view they are largelyregionally based. From French colonial to recent times, diverse populations in thenorthern regions have lacked access to health care, education, and jobs. On theother hand, some Tuareg in the south of Niger have become more integrated intolocal Hausa and Zarma-Songhay societies; and not all Tuareg, even in the north,supported the rebellion. See Bourgeot 1994, Charlick 1991, Claudot-Hawad 1993,and Rasmussen 2001.4 In pre-colonial Tuareg social organization, more nomadic nobles controlled thecaravan trade and owned most weapons and large livestock. They had rights totribute from servile groups in oases, as well as to domestic, herding, and gardeninglabour of newly-acquired slaves (iklan). Despite official social stratum endogamy, insome Tuareg groups nobles and former slaves have long intermarried. Some vestigesof traditional practices persisted even into the early 1980s, well after Frenchmanumission of slaves in the early twentieth century and official abolition of slaveryat Niger’s independence in 1960. By the mid-1990s, however, most of these privilegeshad completely broken down. More nomadic nobles (imajeghen) and moresedentarized oasis populations descending from servile and client groups (ighawalen)now trade, rather than practise traditional tribute (tiwse). Many leaders of the five-year rebellion and current cultural revitalization discourage emphasis upontraditional social origins, and encourage unity of all Tuareg, based upon commonTamajaq language (see Keenan 1977; Bernus 1981; Claudot-Hawad 1993; Nicolaisenand Nicolaisen 1997; Rasmussen 2001).5 Tuareg vary in devotion to Islam. In some groups, particularly around Mount Bagzanin the Air, there are numerous clans of influential and respected Islamic scholars(ineslemen), and the more revered icherifan, who claim descent from the Prophet andare believed to have special blessing and healing powers (Norris 1975, 1990). InNiamey and the large towns, secular courts predominate, and in the countryside localcouncils of marabouts and elders adjudicate disputes according to Qur'anic law(Sharia), and local cultural interpretation, and recently, also, former rebel/peacekeepingforces participate in this. Currently in Niger there is some resurgence of Muslimpuritanical/reform movements such as the Izala sect, from Nigeria and Sudan. Thissect is particularly prominent in the towns and among the Hausa, although officialSharia law has not been declared nationally in Niger as of this writing. It is difficultto predict future Islamic reform influence in Niger (see Gregoire 1993). 6 In the pre-colonial political system, chiefs from noble descent groups elected anamenukalor sultan of their regional confederation. At the local level, councils ofelders, chiefs, and marabouts adjudicated disputes. Beginning early in the twentiethPower, danger and agency among the Tuareg 155"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"century under French colonialism, nomadic camps’ political organization becamemore sedentarized and village-based. Some more paramount chiefs’ powers werestrengthened, reinforced by coercive force from the central government. Otherchiefs’ powers were curtailed, in allegiance to central state laws (Claudot-Hawad1993). Traditionally, chiefs ruled by respect, not coercion, and have also dependedupon belief in their al barakapower to rule. Recently, however, this power has beeneroded for some, but also, as shown, reinforced for others. During the Tuaregrebellion, some traditional chiefs were killed and some elders were disobeyed, or atleast their authority and decisions were questioned by many youths. Some fightersand ‘bandits’ in the turmoil in the north reportedly defied older leaders’ attempts toenforce traditional warrior codes of dignified and honourable conduct: for example,important taboos against raping women and against harming those who do not resistraids. In the past, many Agadez festivals on holy days and national holidays tookplace in the Sultans’ Palace courtyard, a place believed saturated with his al baraka.But since these conflicts, many festivals have shifted to the Maison des Jeunes(YouthHouse). Thus al baraka’s protection of self and others in some contexts remainseffective, but in others, is breaking down.7 Each noble family in the countryside still officially inherits a family of smith/artisans(inaden) as attached clients, and continues to rely upon them in rituals, hair-styling,and manufacture of jewellery and tools, and to some extent still, in marriagenegotiations. Nobles traditionally owe their inherited smiths special meat parts of theslaughtered animal (izouza) at rites of passage; a portion of caravan trade millet; andsugar, tea, millet, and cash during smiths’ praise-singing. Nowadays, there is greaterflexibility in these arrangements: each individual noble can choose a personal smith onthe basis of rapport or work preference for tools and jewellery. In the town of Agadez,these relationships have broken down further, where many smiths have inheritedpatron families still in rural areas, for whom some Agadez smiths now rarely work.Many Tuareg of diverse social origins hint of misuse of powers by both smiths andmarabouts. Some local residents say cryptically that ‘smiths give injections to women’.But many Tuareg agree that ideally, ‘If a person is honest, he/she does not fight with asmith, because a noble does not fight with someone beneath them’. Traditionally,nobles regard smiths are ‘next to slaves’ or similar to slaves. Smiths themselvesemphasize their difference from slaves. According to one elderly smith leader in a ruralvillage, ‘smiths are more important than slaves; slaves were bought; a slave cannot, intradition, inherit a smith’. But following the manumission of slaves in Air oases, a fewformer slaves did, in fact, inherit smith client families. Smith status is thereforecomplex. They are also compared to women, who traditionally, among Tuareg, enjoyhigh status and prestige and economic independence, and to cousins; the latter share ajoking relationship. Smiths are also identified with spirits: specifically, fire djinn, whowork on tiny forges underground and play tricks on travellers (Nicolaisen 1961;Nicolaisen and Nicolaisen 1997; Saenz 1991; Rasmussen 1992, 1998).8 While women sometimes divorce men who become polygynous, some couples remaintogether for their children’s sake. Many more prosperous and prominent men (chiefsand Islamic scholars) in more sedentarized communities are acquiring second, andeven third, wives (up to four are permitted by Islam). Many ethnographers agree thatin general, Tuareg women have enjoyed traditionally high prestige and independentsocioeconomic status. Women build and own the tent, are not secluded, may requestdivorce, and are not compelled to wear a veil. Rather, it is Tuareg men who wear aface-veil, a sign of modesty, reserve, and respect. Most Air Tuareg today practisebilateral descent, inheritance, and succession. There are vestiges of ancient matrilinealinstitutions, such as those forms of property called akhu huderanor ‘living milk’property (herds, date palms) that can be transmitted only to sisters, daughters, or156 Susan Rasmussen"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"nieces, sometimes referred to in English as ‘endowments’ (Worley 1991). ManyTuareg trace their early descent to a female founding ancestress, although in somegroups, notably those with many influential clans of Islamic scholar/marabouts, mentend to highlight male and marabout founders. There have also been many recentupheavals in which women’s rights are disputed. See Rasmussen 1995, 1997, 1998;Claudot-Hawad 1993; and Nicolaisen and Nicolaisen 1997.9 This tuksi, ‘hot’ category of illnesses, opposed to the generic category of ‘cold’illnesses (tesmut), is part of the more general counteractive local disease classificationand healing system, which is similar to Moorish and Latin American systems. ‘Hot’illnesses tend to refer to stomach and liver-related ailments, usually caused byexposure to ‘hot’ foods and other hot things like the sun and heated sand, and canalso refer to anger and other imbalances from sources ranging from psycho-social todietary, and thus includes many non-organic, as well as organic, illnesses. Itsopposite, tesmut, refers to afflictions caused by cold, but this is likewise, extendedmetaphorically to include a whole range of problems, for example, many STDs andurinary tract infections. Ideally, women are ‘cool’ and men ‘hot’ (Figueredo, personalcommunication, Aix-en-Provence, France 2000; Rasmussen 2001; cf. Sanders 2000). 10 See Rasmussen 1995 on Tuareg spirit possession rituals, in which women pre-dominantly, though not exclusively, participate in trance possession. Matrilinealimagery is apparent here and pervasive throughout many Tuareg healing rites(possession and herbalism, in particular). There is reference, for example, to the akhuhuderanliving milk property inheritance (n. 8).11 The state has been frequently deleterious for nomadic women as households areforced to settle. See, for example, O’Kelly and Carney 1986 and Oxby 1977. 12 Usually, newly-married couples spend the first two or three years in uxorilocal post-marital residence, until the groom has completed bridewealth payments and work forhis parents-in-law, in particular, until he has ‘pleased’ his mother-in-law and shepermits the couple to decide where to live and her daughter detaches her ownanimals from her mother’s herds. Many men attempt to bring wives to reside nearertheir own relatives and/or place of work, which is sometimes a source of maritalconflict (Claudot-Hawad 1993; Rasmussen 1997).BibliographyBeidelman, T.O.

Under ordinary circum-stances such murders, though rare, would scarcely attract national – let aloneinternational – attention. But these were no ordinary circumstances. For the boy’sbody was found skinned; the alleged murderers were attempting to sell the skinto a Malawian man. Within weeks, also in Mbeya Region, a second skin-lessbody was reportedly discovered. And in June, so said local papers, a third. Bymid-July a total of six youths had purportedly been killed and skinned, ‘the skins. . . allegedly offered for sale in Malawi, Zambia and the Democratic Republic ofCongo for use in witchcraft activities’, reported the London-based broadsheet,The Guardian.1For many Tanzanians, the rationale for such witchcraft killings wasall too obvious: private economic and political gain. As one paper put it, ‘Thehuman skins and other body parts, including vaginas and penises, are said to bein demand by sorcerers who use them to make powerful concoctions, which arepotent enough to make the rich richer, and the mighty mightier’.2Alarmist and patently moralizing reports filled Tanzanian and regionalnewspapers, radio and television programmes, all recently liberalized underInternational Monetary Fund pressures for structural adjustment. ‘Over the pastthree months’, one among countless news stories reiterated in September 1999,the obnoxious trade in human skin has taken root in Mbeya region.Criminals are said to skin their victims after killing them and sell them toZambia. It is said that an un-bruised human skin would fetch up to 5,000US dollars in Zambia where it is used in witchcraft . . . [A] joint operation[with Zambian and Malawian police] included an elaborate plan to huntdown the criminals of this inhuman trade.3Several months later, another report lamented that: ‘Human beings werebutchered by their assailants who later skinned their corpses to sell the“commodity” in Malawi and Zambia for 5,000 US dollars. Suspects who havebeen arrested say markets for un-bruised human skin can be found as far as theDemocratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Cameroon.’4Chapter 8Save our skinsStructural adjustment, morality and the occult in TanzaniaTodd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Sadly, such happenings may be more than illusory, as the front page photo-graphs of at least one skinned victim grossly attested (cf. Scheper-Hughes 2000).Yet what is particularly striking is how these few incidents in Southern Tanzania– inhumane, inexcusable, deplorable, without a doubt – rocked the nation andfired the popular imagi-nation; how they captured and crystallized, if for amoment, a nationwide sentiment that said somehow, something, somewhere,had gone intolerably wrong. When I visited Tanzania in the summer of 1999, urban and rural rumours hadit that ruthless human skin traders were now searching out their victims notonly in relatively remote villages, but also in the cities of Morogoro, Arusha andDar es Salaam.5It was here, after all, in large urban sprawls, that people could bedisappeared most easily, their skins sold for exorbitant prices, with little risk ofdetection. And even though, as far as I am aware, no skin-less victims have evermaterialized in any Tanzanian city, rumours that they hadran rampant all thesame. Rumours about trafficking in human bodies and body parts for occultpurposes are not unique to Tanzania, and are today recounted widely acrossAfrica (Bastian 1999; Colson 2000: 340; Comaroff and Comaroff 1999;Harnischfeger 1997; Mabiriizi 1986; Scheper-Hughes 1996, 2000; White 1997).Nor is it obvious that such notions – which are not new – will fade into oblivionanytime soon. If anything, witchcraft and other ‘occult economies’ (Comaroffand Comaroff 1999) in their various guises and disguises appear to be rising,rather than declining, across the continent and beyond.6This raises myriad questions, all of them pressing. Why here? Why now? Foreven though recent events are not without precedent (e.g. Jones 1951), thenagging question remains: Why, at this particular historical moment, haverumours about the occult-related transnational trafficking in human skins socaptivated many Tanzanians? And many others across the continent? Morefundamentally, perhaps, how can such beliefs survive, indeed, thrive in ourglobal and globalizing world? At a time when the World Bank and the Inter-national Monetary Fund (IMF) structural adjustment policies insist on efficiency,transparent fiscal policies and good governance the world over, when expansive,liberalized media and markets span the globe, should not witchcraft and otheroccult beliefs simply wither away? Of no less importance, should we in the west – morally, canwe – divert ourever-limited attention and resources from the things that reallymatter, from theharsh realities of political economies that govern, often with painful clarity,many Africans’ life-worlds? After all, the World Bank tells us, Sub-SaharanAfrica is in ‘crisis’ (World Bank 1981, 1989). Among Africa’s oft-cited troublesare ‘high rates of population growth, low levels of investment and saving . . .inefficient resource use, weak institutional capacity and human resources, and ageneral decline in income and living standards’ (World Bank 1989: 17). Byfocusing on recent rumours of occult trading are we not overlooking thosethings that matter most? This chapter suggests quite the opposite.Adjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 161"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"As we shall see, these two sets of concerns – human skin trading and occultforces, on the one hand, and the (de)pressing materialities of people’s daily lives,on the other – are inexorably linked. Following recent poststructuralist concernsto deconstruct the development enterprise (Escobar 1991, 1995; Ferguson1994), this chapter argues that the recent rise of occult idioms and practices inTanzania is directly related to the way structural adjustment has been presentedand implemented. Over the past decade Tanzania has been thoroughly ‘adjusted’ by the IMF andWorld Bank: markets and media liberalized, government bureaucracies ration-alized. These institutions have continually presented structural adjustment andthe changes it has unleashed as a technical matter of means-ends calculation and‘efficiency’, motored, in some matter-of-fact manner, by value-free economictheories. Such views render structural adjustment and social change, at least forits advocates, unproblematic, natural and amoral.7Ordinary Tanzanians, however, reject such claims, insisting that recentchanges raise a host of moral and moralizing questions that demand attention: atwhose expense do market reforms come? Who wins? Who loses? Is thisdesirable? Is it acceptable? And it is here, in light of these and related questions,that popular ruminations over occult dealings raise pointed and morally-probingquestions about the limitations and liberations of ‘the market’, the circulation ofcommodities across international borders, and the implications and desirabilityof such things both for individuals and for society as a whole. In this sense, ‘theoccult’ – by which I mean unseen powers, positive or negative – provides acompelling local lexicon for re-moralizing sterile World Bank/IMF stories aboutstructural adjustment and social change (Ferguson 1995).8But ‘the occult’ is not just a way to contemplate the moralities and immoral-ities of a changing world. It also has very real material consequences in and onthat world. For many Tanzanians, successfully managing occult forces has longbeen a logical prerequisite for gaining and maintaining status and wealth. For aslong as there have been powerful and powerless, rich and poor people, there hasbeen a ready-made market for occult powers. But today, with structuraladjustment’s relentless imposition of ‘the free market’, the possibilities formarketing the occult appear virtually limitless. Diviners now sell occult‘medicines’ across the nation at large, ‘liberalized’ markets; African witchesallegedly cross ethnic divides to exchange know-how and ‘medicines’ at con-ferences in Europe. Thanks to ‘the free market’ the occult itself has in recentyears been commodified in ways previously neither possible nor imaginable. Baldly stated, then, this chapter argues that structural adjustment has providednecessary and sufficient conditions for the rapid proliferation of occult discoursesand practices in Tanzania. To make this point I use ethnographic material fromthe Ihanzu, those Tanzanians I know best. The Ihanzu provide a particularly telling case since, for them, using humanskin, genitalia or other human body parts to occult ends has no local resonance.No Ihanzu I know ever suggested that local occult users, of whom there are162 Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"reputedly many, engage in such practices. And yet because the Ihanzu, likemany Tanzanians, were patently gripped by the stories of trafficking in humanskins for occult purposes, we must ask whythey find such trafficking meaningfulwhen the exact symbolic and practical linkages between human skins, occultforces and wealth creation remain elusive. The answer, as we shall see, lies inmuch broader understandings of occult forces, morality, the market and com-modification. But first, before providing any specifics, we must consider twogeneral, competing visions of the recent structural adjustment-induced changesin Tanzania. Millennial moments in the Tanzanian postcolony: official andunofficial storiesIn recent years Tanzania has undergone profound political, economic and socialchanges, driven by an array of internal and external forces (see Tripp 1997).Principle among the external forces have been the IMF and the World Bank,together with their policies of structural adjustment. When Tanzania (then Tanganyika) gained independence from Britain in1961, the nascent nation’s first president, Julius Nyerere, forged and followed aunique path of ‘non-Marxist socialism’ (Tripp 1997: 62) known as ujamaa.9Thenation’s guiding ujamaaprinciples were explicitly formulated in the now-famousArusha Declaration. Though fundamentally African in its philosophical outlook(Ferguson 1995: 134; Pratt 1976: 7; Stoger-Eising 2000), in practice ujamaafollowed a Sino-Soviet model of state centralization, whereby administrativepowers were highly concentrated in the central government and delegated tolocal level authorities in diminishing amounts. The Tanzanian state nationalizedmajor commercial, financial and manufacturing industries; imposed severeimport restrictions on foreign goods and currencies; and emphasized productionwithin the nation, for the nation. By the mid-1980s, for several reasons, ujamaawas on its last leg.10It was in1986, under the Republic’s second president, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, that Tanzaniabecame fully committed to an IMF-led structural adjustment programme; aprogramme that would forever change the face of the nation.So what is structural adjustment? Simply stated, structural adjustment isabout market reform, and ‘getting the price right’. It operates on the principlethat less government intervention in the economy is better; that economieswill work best, and most efficiently, if propelled by market forces rather thanbureaucrats. Structural adjustment, then, is a move ‘away from more autonomous,nationalistic, inward-oriented, import-substitution, state interventionist, andsocialist models towards laissez-fairecapitalism’ (Sparr 1994: 2).While at least initially structural adjustment was seen as being mainly aboutmacroeconomic policies (e.g. World Bank 1981), the IMF, World Bank andothers soon came to believe that ‘good governance’ and a politically ‘enablingenvironment’ were logical prerequisites for economic growth (World BankAdjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 163"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"1989, 1994).11Thus, when structural adjustment policies failed to improveAfrican economies, the IMF and other international agencies blamed ineptAfrican bureaucracies, assuming that ‘[t]he public sector lies at the core of thestagnation and decline in growth in Africa’ (World Bank 1994: 99). Practically,this meant African countries would have to undergo fundamental politicalreforms before they would receive further foreign aid.In Tanzania, beginning in the early 1990s under President Mwinyi, this dualinsistence on economic and political restructuring ushered in an entirely neworder (or perhaps more accurately, dis-order) commonly recalled as a ruksaor‘free-for-all’.12Emblematic of this (dis)order is the Zanzibar Declaration of 1991,as it later came to be known, which boldly challenged the 1967 ArushaDeclaration and led to a number of consequential ‘amendments’ to it; amend-ments that, in reality, radically undermined rather than updated the ArushaDelcaration’s original vision. The Zanzibar Declaration allows party leaders andcivil servants to own shares in companies, rent property and to engage inbusiness for private gain – all (legal) impossibilities under the ArushaDeclaration. ‘The symbolic importance of these changes’, notes Tripp, ‘cannotbe emphasized strongly enough, for the Arusha Declaration was the centraldocument in establishing the egalitarian, self-reliant, and socialist orientationthat Tanzania adopted’ (1997: 171). Other liberalizations followed suit: privatizingmany parastatals; abolishing foreign exchange restrictions; legalizing privatecommerce and trade; allowing local and foreign newspapers and magazines,radio and television broadcasts to circulate freely. Equally decisive in shaping the newly ‘adjusted’ nation was the TanzanianNational Assembly’s passage of the 8th Constitutional Amendment Act in May1992. This paved the way for Tanzania’s first multiparty elections, held in 1995,when Benjamin Mkapa became the Republic’s third president. In October 2000,Mkapa was re-elected for a second and final five-year term.From the outset President Mkapa and his administration have enthusiasticallysupported structural adjustment measures. Much more so, in fact, than didMwinyi. At home and abroad, with irrepressible determination, Mkapa hascontinually draw attention to the merits of ‘good governance’ and ‘liberalization’as well as to the evils of ‘corruption’. What is more, his proclamations have beenmatched every step of the way by further policy reforms. Consequently, when Anupam Basu, the Deputy Director for Africa Depart-ment in the IMF, visited Dar es Salaam in December 2000 – his first visit toTanzania since the 1980s – he found a radically changed world. The tangiblesigns of ‘adjustment’ were everywhere. The few government-owned newspapers,Daily News, Uhuruand Mzalendo, had been eclipsed by more than twenty-fivelocal and international newspapers, magazines and tabloids, in both English andSwahili, available on many news-stands; the single state radio station had beenjoined by manifold others from near and afar; urban and some rural Tanzanianscould watch the private television network ITV which broadcasts local andforeign serials and newscasts, as well as many American sitcoms, soaps and164 Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"action movies. No fewer than thirteen political parties had registered; and twomultiparty presidential elections had already taken place. Shops in Dar esSalaam, Arusha and across the country were bursting with foreign and domesticconsumer goods; the informal economy was bustling. From an official viewpoint, these have been unquestionably positive develop-ments. In the Deputy Director’s own words: ‘I always urge with my colleaguesthat you cannot judge a country whether it has improved or not if you have notvisited the country for ten or twenty years since your last visit. From what I havewitnessed in your country I can confess that Tanzania has very much developedand changed.’13By all ‘objective’ indicators, too, according to official reckoning,Tanzania is today well-adjusted – or at least adjusting well. An IMF press releasefrom April 2000 accurately captures the moment:Tanzania has made substantial progress in implementing economic reforms.During the past 4 years, inflation decreased to less than 7%, after manyyears of rates exceeding 20%, and the government has been repayingdomestic debt, after many years of borrowing in excess of 3% of GDPannually. Tanzania has also made a strong structural adjustment effort inrecent years, including far-reaching reforms in the external, financial, andpublic sectors.14Due to Tanzania’s ‘good’ fiscal and political behaviour all round, the IMF andWorld Bank in 2001 agreed to write off about one-half of Tanzania’s debt-serviceobligations to the year 2003, and about one-third thereafter.In official eyes, thanks largely to structural adjustment, Tanzania is rapidlybecoming a success story. And I emphasize here a story, for the story of structuraladjustment, as told in myriad IMF and World Bank publications, tells in somany ways of the triumph of the Market over the Command Economy; ofcapitalism’s success and socialism’s failure; of the righteousness of the west andthe wrongheadedness the rest. It subscribes unabashedly to modernity’s guidingmasternarratives, the European Enlightenment-inspired notions of unilinearprogress and development (Ferguson 1999; Englund and Leach 2000). This is ateleological tale, above all, of the triumph of neoliberal ideologies and policiesin our contemporary world. But it is not told that way, not officially anyway. Although in many places,especially in post-socialist places like Tanzania, capitalism and the market arepresented ‘as a gospel of salvation’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 2000: 292; forth-coming) – displaying what billionaire philanthropist George Soros (1998) hasdubbed ‘market fundamentalism’ – this has not been the story of structuraladjustment. Rather, as Ferguson (1995) has incisively argued, structural adjust-ment’s story is routinely told in cold, technocratic tones, where GDP, inflationfigures and other macro-economic indicators reign supreme. Here, the confidentrhetoric of social change is one of scientific objectivity, where ‘facts’ and‘findings’ are endlessly (re)presented as authoritative, logical and rationallyAdjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 165"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"derived (Apthorpe 1986; Bernstein 1990; Brydon 1999: 382). Official analysesare allegedly driven by considerations of ‘efficiency’, ‘pragmatism’, ‘hardheadedanalysis’ and the like (e.g. World Bank 1989: 162, 189; 1994: 204). The IMFand World Bank have remained dogmatically committed to the idea that theyhave no dogma.Telling stories in this way does several things. For one, it suggest there is ascientific, no-nonsense bottom-line, discernible through the careful applicationof macro- and microeconomic theories (Heilbroner 1973; Mehmet 1999).Moreover, it naturalizes ‘structural adjustment’ and ‘the market’, making themappear inevitable and beyond reproach (Pottier 1999: 98; Williams 1999).Finally, and not inconsequentially, telling stories this way allows ‘structuraladjustment’, ‘the market’ and ‘social change’ to present themselves as amoral –as neither good nor bad, but simply the natural, unavoidable course of events. Itwould be just as foolish, so the reasoning goes, to lament the sun’s rising in theeast as it would the advent of the free market. Both just happen. ‘The moralityof the market’, notes Ferguson, ‘denies its own status as a morality, presentingitself as mere technique’ (1995: 139). And so it goes with structural adjustment. Alternative visions of the momentWhile structural adjustment presents itself as scientific, natural and thereforemorally unproblematic, the radical changes it has wrought as so obviouslypositive as to merit no serious discussion, ordinary Tanzanians tell a differenttale. Underpinning it are some different facts and figures about the effects ofstructural adjustment policies, which: frequently compound many of the hardships, resulting in inflation inducedby devaluation and massive layoffs due to closures of uncompetitiveindustries. The inability of the state, generally the major source ofemployment, to provide adequate incomes and employment promptedindividuals, groups, and mutual-aid organizations to seek alternativesolutions to their worsening economic situations. The decline in real wages,coupled with rising rates of unemployment, led many urban dwellers to seekinformal sources of income to supplement their wages or to leave their jobsaltogether and go into private business or farming.(Tripp 1997: 22)Indeed, not a few scholars of Tanzania have argued that structural adjustmenthas ‘forced a majority of people [in Dar es Salaam] to use the informal sector as asurvival strategy’ (Lugalla 1997: 440; also Lugalla 1995; Mbilinyi 1990); andoccasioned a nationwide increase in religious and ethnic tensions (Kaiser 1996).Equally, in rural areas, ‘in “liberalized” Tanzania, farmers are growing more crops,risking more in marketing them, spending more in cultivating them, andearning less from their sale’ (Ponte 1998: 339). 166 Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Lest we forget, Tanzania remains one of the poorest countries in the worldtoday. Per capita income is estimated at $120 annually, with nearly 40 per centof Tanzanians living on less than $0.65 per day15– which explains why so manyTanzanians today spend such exorbitant amounts of time and energy ‘getting by’(Tripp 1997). Small wonder, really, that former President Mwinyi’s ruksaor ‘free-for-all’ has now given way to the era of ukapa(after President Mkapa): a termcoined and used in popular parlance which roughly translates as ‘lots of goods,no money to buy them’ (cf. Brydon 1999: 378–379). For many, it appears thatthis has been the austere outcome of Tanzania’s being ‘adjusted’ by the IMF,other international agencies and the government itself for more than a decade.As one Tanzanian recently lamented: ‘Deep down . . . everybody is groaning atthe economic hardship.’16On the other hand some Tanzanians havebenefited – some astonishingly so –from this recently arrived and liberalized world of goods. New Pajeros, LandCruisers and Range Rovers travel the roads like never before; businessmen andothers are sometimes seen in smart Armani and Hugo Boss suits. Problem is, forthe vast majority, participating in such a world is a veritable impossibly – whichonly heightens, with tedious regularity, the relativepoverty those denied accessto this new world routinely experience under structural adjustment’s reign.17Unlike the IMF’s confident metanarrative, then, the popular tale manyTanzanians tell about the current moment is one of queries, not convictions; ofgrave uncertainties about the nation’s present and future trajectory; of ever-increasing structural adjustment-induced hardships and poverty (Campbell andStein 1992). This tale speaks to the capriciousness of the market, the erratic riseand demise of individual fortunes, the promises and the perils of the newlyadjusted nation. Moreover, as we shall see, this tale is told in an entirely differenttenor, concerned as it is with the moralities and immoralities of recent changes.It suggests that ‘debates about market regulation and liberalization are notsimply about the mechanics of economic transactions . . . but are embeddeddeeply in normative discourse about social relations and political values’ (Gouldand von Oppen 1994: 4; also Appadurai 1986; Gudeman 1986; Parry and Bloch1989). This is not just a story of woes, but of both hope and despair, ofprosperity and austerity, one that seriously reflects on both the virtues and vicesof the country’s rapidly-shifting economic, political and moral terrain. Ratherthan speak in generalities about such things, I focus here on the Ihanzu,implying throughout that their experiences with recent changes resonate withthose of many other Tanzanians.The Ihanzu and market (im)moralitiesThe Ihanzu number around 30,000. Most lead an agricultural life in SingidaRegion, north-central Tanzania, the place they have called ‘home’ for over acentury. This rural homeland area is far from Tanzania’s major urban centres. Itis a nearly two-day drive from Dar es Salaam; and a long day’s drive from Arusha.Adjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 167"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Ihanzu are inveterate travellers. This has been true since at least colonialtimes when, beginning in the 1910s, many were forced to trek vast distances tocarry out migrant labour (Adam 1963), a trend that continues today. In the1930s Lutheran missionaries entered the area and they, too, cleared pathwaysthat a number of Ihanzu converts have since travelled: relocating to other ruralareas to spread The Word, or to Tanzanian cities for higher education, employ-ment and sometimes permanent settlement. In Dar es Salaam, Arusha andSingida, one can today find second- and even third-generation Ihanzu (many ofthem Christians), who, though born and raised in the cities, consider themselves‘Ihanzu’. Such urbanites frequently maintain links with their ‘home’ villages,where some occasionally visit kin, attend funerals and are buried.Whether urban or rural, Ihanzu experiences with recent macro-level changesin the political-economy have been remarkably similar: nearly all feel that, oflate, life has grown increasingly intolerable. In the words of one young IhanzuDar es Salaam-based businesswoman who I interviewed in late 1999: ‘Under[President] Mwinyi some things worked. But today, with [President] Mkapa, ithas become impossible to do business: taxes are collected by force, and we can’tafford to pay them. If you follow the law, you can’t succeed in business today.’And from another interview that year, in the words of an Ibaga-villageguesthouse owner (who only began doing business in Ihanzu in 1991, after beingmade redundant from his Dar es Salaam job as a medical statistician):In 1991 business was verygood; . . . By 1995 things began to decline. 1996wasn’t so good; and 1998 was just mediocre, but better than today. . . .Today, business is extremely bad for everyone. . . because we’re all lockedtogether by one thing, a thing called ‘money’. And the circulation of money– even at the national level – the nation itself is sticking (kwama) and isbemoaning (lalimika) the fact that there’s no money. . . . I’m a businessman.But here in Ibaga, there’s no money and no business. You’ll find anotherwith a shop, also moaning ‘there’s no money’....We’re all ruled by thecirculation of money.Such have been the deleterious effects of IMF-led restructuring on most,perhaps all, Ihanzu – and on many other Tanzanians. Based on my ownexperiences in Tanzania through the 1990s, I believe my informants when theytell me such things, when they say that life has grown increasingly difficult allround. But my aim is not to ‘prove’ this. I offer no hard economic data from‘before’ and ‘after’ to argue that the Ihanzu, or any others, have been hard doneby structural adjustment. My first concern, instead, is with what the Ihanzu sayabout the nation’s rapidly-shifting economic and political terrain, and with howthey say it. And this means discussing ‘the occult’. My second concern is withhow, in the era of structural adjustment, ‘the occult’ has itself been commodifiedand thus vastly expanded, both in the popular imagination and in its practicalreach.168 Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Markets, moralities and occult forcesThe Ihanzu, like many peoples across Africa, divide their world into two distinctrealms (Nyamnjoh, Chapter 2). The first is the manifest world, the world that isvisible, plain and ‘obvious’ to all.

The second world runs parallel to the first and isunseen. This is the realm of witchcraft (u~logi), ancestral spirits (alu~ngu~) and god(itunda). This occult (ushirikinaor mazingara) realm is very much a part of theIhanzu’s everyday lives – albeit an invisible part – which they understand aspedestrian and commonplace (cf. Ashforth 1996).These visible and invisible realms are thought to be causally linked inthat the former is animated by unseen forces from the latter. Invisible forcesdetermine visible outcomes. Thus, as with the logical of conspiracy theories, theIhanzu maintain that most or all everyday activities are guided and shaped infundamental ways by unseen forces. Our everyday world is simply a façade thatmasks a deeper, more ‘real reality,’ one that lies beyond our immediate compre-hension, one that harbours the engine of all this-worldly events (Ashforth 1996:1220; Douglas 1970: xvi). Because occult forces shape the Ihanzu’s daily lives, control over these forcesis crucial. There are many ways to tap into, harness and manage hidden forces ofthe universe. One popular way is by using ‘medicine’. Medicine (ikota, or dawain Swahili) is a broad term. It can refer to the concoctions of diviners, rain-makers or witches as well as to western medicines – including illegal drugs – anddehydrated and compressed foods eaten by soldiers and astronauts. As alreadynoted, the notion of using human skins or body parts for occult medicine isforeign to the Ihanzu. Even Ihanzu witches, people say, have no knowledge ofsuch things. However, few would deny that others across the country, region andthe continent routinely use human skins and body parts to generate illicitwealth through occult means.For the Ihanzu, it is common knowledge that people use certain ‘medicine’to amass wealth and to gain political position, as well as to protect suchthings once acquired. As one Christian Ihanzu man named Marko, a long-timeresident of Dar es Salaam who holds a Master’s degree from a prominent UKuniversity and is today director of a large Tanzanian parastatal, told me: ‘When-ever a government position becomes vacant, you will notice lots of people goingto [diviners in] Bagamoyo for medicine. The government knows about this butremains silent.’ There is nothing inherently problematic about employing occult forces inthis way. In both urban and rural settings, for instance, it is commonly assumedthat people use medicine called kı~sumbato attract such things as materialwealth, customers, lovers, rain, fish or, as Marko mentioned, even a better job.This might be seen as ‘good luck medicine’, or a ‘medicine of attraction’. Sincekı~sumbais said to harm no one, it can theoretically be used without fear of socialAdjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 169"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"reprisal. Another medicine, called kinga, is similarly considered morally tenable.Kinga, people say, functions solely to protect its user against more malevolentoccult forces. It is common, many mention, for shopkeepers, businesspersons,politicians, farmers, herders and myriad others to fortify their persons andproperty medicinally in this way.But medicine can also be put to more nefarious ends, as when witches use itto destroy the wealthy and politically powerful and to amass illicitly wealth andpower for themselves. For example, Ihanzu witches purportedly use medicine tokill people so that they can transform them into zombies (atumbu~ka) who thentoil at night on the witch’s plot. By killing and creating a nocturnal zombielabour force, witches misanthropically reroute others’ reproductive powers totheir own illicit ends. Needless to say, such exploitation of occult forces ismorally objectionable all round. Another apparent witch favourite, equally devastating in its effects, is ndagu~.Those who use ndagu~(a sort of ‘medicinal pact with a diviner’) reputedlybenefit, but only at the immediate expense of others. Thus, an ndagu~user mightgain political prominence, or become extremely wealthy in cattle, crops or shops,but only by first sacrificing one or several close kin. In Marko’s words: ‘In Dar esSalaam, there are people with, say, four children. They are told to choose theone they love most and kill him or her to get [for example] a job! This reallyhappens, to get a good opportunity or to become rich.’ From other Ihanzu I haveheard many such stories, often told in moralizing tones: a young man fromDodoma who allegedly sacrificed his brother for wealth; a Regional TradeOfficer who gave up his child for the same. In this zero-sum universe, the witch’sgain is the moral man’s bane (Sanders 1999). The Ihanzu Christian minority, who make up around 20 per cent of the totalIhanzu population, has a slightly different take on these matters. No IhanzuChristian doubts the efficacy of ‘medicine’ or that people regularly use it.Neither, as Marko makes clear, would any deny the veracity of witchcraft –many indefatigably noting that ‘witchcraft is in the Bible’. Yet their religionteaches them, as did early missionaries, that ‘traditional medicine’ and witchcraftare this-worldly manifestations of the devil which must therefore be steadfastlyavoided. To steer occult forces, then, Christians must instead pray to Jesus ordirectly to God – the most potent and benevolent of all unseen powers. TheChristian god thus overpowers rather than replaces other occult forces likewitchcraft (van Dijk, Chapter 5; Meyer 1992; Wild 1998). For Christians, then,drawing on any occult forces, their own god(s) notwithstanding, is seen as eviland immoral. In any case, Ihanzu Christians share with the non-Christianmajority the notion that occult forces must be managed; they differ only overhow best to do this, and in their moral evaluations of the different methods.There is a rather obvious difficulty here – and this is the point. Since noordinary Ihanzu has direct access to the hidden realm of powers, the ultimatecauses of this-worldly events can only be inferred, never once-and-for-allknown. The operation of power between invisible and visible worlds thus170 Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"remains profoundly ambivalent (Arens and Karp 1989; Geschiere 1997). Andthis ambivalence, in turn, makes it is impossible to know whether or not anyparticular this-worldly event is the result of moral or immoral conduct (cf.Middleton 1960). Is a man rich because he prays to Jesus, because he uses a (fornon-Christians) morally tenable medicine like kı~sumba, or because he usesndagu~, which all agree demands a human sacrifice and is thus irredeemablyimmoral? Is a politician powerful because he uses socially-sanctioned kingatoprotect himself, or because, through some dubious medicinal doings, he kills offhis adversaries? Does he feed people or feed onpeople? The manifest signs provide clues, but no definitive answers. Which is why theoccult, in Ihanzu and across Africa, provides a compelling local vocabulary fordeliberating over issues of entitlement and morality. By definition occult idiomsraise the issues: Who gets what and why? At whose expense? And, How desirableis this? (Auslander 1993; Bastian 1993; Comaroff and Comaroff 1993; Rasmussen1998). Let me provide an example of how the Ihanzu discuss ‘the market’ andthe rise and demise of individual fortunes in terms of occult forces; and how thisis, simultaneously, a discussion about morality.Bonifasi and his wife Maria, both of Chagga ethnic origin and devout RomanCatholics, first came to Ihanzu to do business in the 1960s. They opened a smallshop in the western village of Chem Chem and, some years later, moved toIbaga village. Their business grew slowly at first, and boomed in the late 1980sand early 1990s with the demise of ujamaa. They soon opened a shop in Dar esSalaam, and began to amass a considerable fortune by selling Ihanzu-boughtmaize and beans for a healthy profit in Dar, while acquiring modern consumergoods in Dar and selling them in Ihanzu. Over the past five years, however,coinciding with recent shifts in the political-economy, their businesses in bothlocations have faltered. They recently sold their shop in Dar es Salaam. Thesedevelopments have not gone unnoticed by Ihanzu villagers, and have occasionedmuch discussion and speculation. Bonifasi and Maria, for their part, publicly attribute their personal fortunesand misfortunes to God alone. Bonifasi insisted to me, as he has to others, thatwe can only pray to the all-knowing God for success and protection againstothers’ ill-doings. He claims never to have used non-Christian occult forces ofany type to gain or maintain his wealth and to have no knowledge of suchthings. Others beg to differ. This is how Hamisi, a 64-year-old farmer and formerIbaga village businessman, explained Bonfasi’s recent misfortunes to me:Bonifasi was the wealthiest in the village, but he was bewitched! Hischildren became drunks and wasted their father’s money. His wife now has astrange illness that causes her to be epileptic. She has withered a lot, andtheir wealth is beginning to end. They had cars, but now they are allruined. He used to live in Dar [es Salaam] but has now failed. He’s returned[to Ibaga] now to run the business himself, but it’s ruined. It’s not like in thepast. And these things surprise us. We see that this man was intelligent.Adjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 171"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Why has this happened to him? We know this is because of witchcraft oflocals who see modernity [and destroy it].When I asked Hamisi about how Bonifasi had become rich in the first place, hedid not hesitate: ‘He used kı~sumbaof course; and he used kinga, too, to protecthimself, his family and his riches.’Halima, a middle-aged woman from a nearby village, offered a somewhatdifferent perspective:Bonifasi has something witch-like about him (mazingara yake). Lotsofpeople say this. His witchcraft is that he doesn’t want others to get anything,that he [wants to] get everything for himself. . . . After trying [withwitchcraft] to ruin a particular [business?] person, he saw the effects of[counter-] witchcraft on his wife. She has become crippled, epileptic. She’sstill alive all right, like an ordinary human being, but her mind has beenruined by witchcraft!Other villagers told me that Bonifasi had made an ndagu~pact at his wife’sexpense (or at the expense of other unspecified villagers), causing her to becomehalf mad and epileptic for the sake of material riches – a pact that had apparentlygone terribly wrong, since even the riches had now vanished.The point worth stressing is that such witchcraft rumours speak directly toissues of morality, and more specifically, to the morality of the market. Theypose difficult questions about who gets what, how they get it, and at whoseexpense. Hamisi’s explanation highlights the fact that accumulation is notimmoral per se, but fraught with difficulties. He claims Bonifasi used medicinesto acquire and protect his wealth and sees no moral dilemma with this. Bonifasi,after all, was only attracting business, and riches, and protecting himself againstother evil-doers. The difficulty, however, arises when envious others turn theirwitchcraft against him, which occasioned the loss of Bonfasi’s wealth and hiswife’s health. Hamisi’s is a commentary on the perils of prosperity, the inherentdangers of doing business in an intensely competitive economic climate. And heshould know: Hamisi blames his own failed business ventures on fellow villagers’witchcraft, which he says made his children ill and caused two owls to dance onhis doorstep – a definitive warning, in his mind, of worse things to come, whicheventually did. Halima’s explanation and ones similar to it are more ominous. And moredamning. They suggest that Bonfasi’s economic rise and demise resulted from hisown gluttonous desires, expressed at the immediate expense of others. He waseither done in by his competitors’ superior witchcraft or for having agreed to anndagu~that went horribly wrong. His actions are deeply disapproved of, and saidto be wholly evil (mbı~tai).

No one gets something for nothing.Seen in this light, there is nothing at all ‘free’ about the so-called freemarket(soko huria). By its very ‘nature’ the market extracts a heavy toll in human lives.Far from being ‘natural’, ‘obvious’ and ‘amoral’, as modernity’s mouthpiecesinsist it is, the market is laden with ambiguities, uncertainties and profoundmoral dilemmas. One’s involvement in it, these days unavoidable, is as dangerousas it is potentially rewarding. With the recent wave of liberalizations that has washed over Tanzania thepossibilities for personal enrichment through the Market have increasedmanifold. This has also meant increased competition and conflict over scarceresources (cf. Kaiser 1996) as well as greater economic differentiation. Con-sequently, the occult has featured even more prominently. Niko, a middle-agedChristian man from Kirumi village, explained it like this:I’ve been to Arusha and Shinyanga and all over the place and, from whatI’ve heard, it’s true: everyone uses medicines to attract business! Also itdoesn’t matter whether they are Ihanzu, Sukuma, Chagga or whatever. Theyalluse medicine. There’s no other way in this difficult economy. Everyone isselling but very few are buying. There’s little money to go around. No onehas money. But everyone is trying to sell things to make a living. It is muchworse in the cities than here [in the villages]. This is because there are toomany people selling things, and there are never enough customers. Theyhave to be resourceful, they have to use medicine to attract customers. . . .Don’t think it’s ok. It’s not. It’s verybad. But what can they do?[Witchcraft] is much worse today than ever before.. . . In the past peoplewanted only a few things....Today there are too many things that peoplewant. . . . cars, bicycles, radios, nice houses, etc. . . . Everyone wants todevelop (kuendelea). But think about it....How is this possible? Peoplebecome jealous of what others around them have. Maybe that one has aradio and that one doesn’t, but he wants one....He might be so angry thathe bewitches the neighbour and his stupid radio. He might try to knockhim down, to cause him to go backwards (kurudi nyuma) so that he will notdevelop. This is why today witchcraft is much worse. It is developmentitself that brings witchcraft. More development means more witchcraft. Such comments speak volumes about ordinary Tanzanians’ yearnings for ameaningful modernity (in this case, an equitabledistribution of wealth) and,conversely, of their lack of interest in numerically-impressive but sociallyvacuous statistics on GDP and inflation. Such remarks also speak to the logicalinconsistencies in structural adjustment dogma, namely, the notion of infinitewants in a universe of finite possibilities.If the advent of the free market in Tanzania has increased speculation about‘the occult’ – about how best to connect means and ends, actions and outcomes,and to evaluate the morality and immorality of these nebulous processes – it hasAdjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 173"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"also provided the very mechanism by which such ideas and practices are spread.After all, the ‘free’ market is a place where, for a price, anything and everythingcan be had, occult medicines and powers included.Commodifying the occultI have spoken to many Ihanzu diviners (aganga), acknowledged experts in‘medicine’ for sale, who claim that their business has, in recent years, skyrocketed.All claim they deal in ‘good’ occult medicines rather than ‘bad’ witchcraft-related ones, even if they also regularly imply an intimate knowledge of both. Tanzanians today travel great distances to buy ‘medicines’ from diviners infaraway villages. I have met clients of one well-known Ihanzu diviner who camefrom as far away as Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Tanga, many well-educated andeconomically and politically well-to-do. Some suggested that, by visitingdiviners far from home, it was easier to remain discrete – always an issue whenpositive occult forces can all too easily be mistaken for negative ones.Many diviners at the turn of the millennium do reasonable business not onlyat home in the villages but across the country. Saidi, a well-known Ihanzudiviner, today spends much of his time travelling around the country overtly andcovertly practising his trade. Since the early 1990s, he claims, he has beensecretly summoned on several occasions by district-level government officials inKiomboi, who paid him for medicinally protecting them against witchcraft. Healso says he was paid for medicinally fortifying butcher shops, small hotels, barsand scores of everyday businesses en route. The fact that his humble home ispacked full of blankets, radios, chairs and other such modern wares suggeststhere is more to his stories than mere entertainment value. Other diviners Iknow are similarly well-off, and tell similar tales. These days, too, many diviners openly traffic their goods across the country atlarge, travelling markets (minada; sing., mnada), markets that owe their veryexistence to the recent wave of liberalizations. Such markets, which are nownumerous, are made up of small convoys of large lorries that follow regularcircuits around each district. On the same date each month, at regular locationsalong their route, they set up market. Literally thousands attend these markets.For some, it is simply to look and to visit with friends and relatives. For others,notably those in remote areas, it is because these markets are the only place tobuy things for miles. To the furthest, most remote corners of the country minadabring a host of consumer goods and goodies: pots, pans and plastic wares, driedfish, fresh meat, second-hand clothes. And occult ‘medicine’.Since the mid-1990s one such market has made a monthly visit to Ihanzuand set up just outside Ibaga village. Figure 8.1 shows a diviner at the Ibagamarket, a man from Tabora (western Tanzania), consulting with an Ihanzu client.Before them lie his medicines: various bits of root, bark and bottled-substances.Figure 8.2 shows a large, cloth banner standing beside him which reads: ‘SeniorTraditional Diviner, Elder Kipara, S.L.P. Igunga [village] Tabora’. Then follows a174 Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"list of illnesses and symptoms he claims to treat, and some of the medicines onoffer. To take just a few: (1) epilepsy; (3) shooting pains; (11) swollen feet; (19)love medicine; (29) bloody nose; (30) fertility medicine; (33) skin disease; and(34) dizziness. Also on offer are: (20) medicine to protect individuals againstwitchcraft; (21) business medicine; (47) medicine to protect a home againstwitchcraft; (55) removal (lit. ‘shaving’) of witchcraft; and (58) medicine to raisethe dead. Clearly, with the ‘free’ market, marketing the occult has become bigbusiness. This is one reason, as countless Ihanzu have told me, the occult is not what itused to be. ‘Witchcraft has gone mad (ovio) these days’, noted one elderly Ihanzuvillager. ‘It used to follow [within] the clan, but today you can buy it fromanyone, anywhere, anytime.’ Another from Matongo village remarked similarly:‘In the past, only a few elderly women understood such things; today anyonecan buy medicine.’Such comments conjure the distinction Evans-Pritchard (1937) long agomade, based on his time among the Azande, between ‘witchcraft’ and ‘sorcery’.Witchcraft, Azande believed, formed part of a witch’s innermost make-up andwas transmitted genetically. Sorcery, on the other hand, was a technique thatcould be acquired and used by anyone. Though the Ihanzu, like many Africans,do not distinguish linguistically between ‘witchcraft’ and ‘sorcery’ – they callboth u~logi(Swahili, uchawi) – it is clear that they dotoday draw this distinctionconceptually. And what their comments clearly say is this: ‘witchcraft’ isdeclining, but ‘sorcery’ is increasing dramatically. With the democratization ofAdjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 175Figure 8.1A diviner from Tabora District, western Tanzania, practising his trade at atravelling martket (mnada) in Ihanzu, June 1994.

Through the all-pervasive ‘free’ market, anyone who can afford it now has instant access tooccult forces. Note, the logic here goes beyond just ‘new market access’, toexplore the depths of the market’s apparent operation.Across Africa, the occult has always been about controlling the powers ofproduction, reproduction and growth. This is as true for ‘positive’ and theoreti-cally unproblematic occult forces as it is for ‘negative’ ones, like witchcraft,where such control nearly always implies direct predation on others. Throughoccult means, wealth and power can be produced, replicated and reproduced.Negative replication routinely requires illicitly rerouting one person’s repro-ductive powers and life-substances to the benefit of another. The difference now,it appears, is that occult powers of replication have themselves become, like the176 Todd SandersFigure 8.2The Tabora diviner’s make-shift, cloth banner which lists some of the symptomshe treats and the medicines available for sale, including medicine to get richin business, to protect one’s self and home against witchcraft and to raise thedead (dawa ya kuita mfu alive).

In ways previously unimaginable the occult nowappears to expand, and reproduce itself, quite of its own volition. Interestingly, since the market is now more vocally translocal and ‘freer’ thanever before, so, too, are the possibilities for this expansion and the exchange ofoccult powers. Newspaper and popular stories abound about occult practitionersmoving and trading on a truly global scale (cf. Parish 2000). One Ihanzu man,born and raised in Dar es Salaam, told me about a troublesome Tanzanianwho allegedly bought ‘medicine’ from a Ghanaian witch at a World HealthOrganization conference in Switzerland. The moral of these stories? ‘The market’,and its promises and perils, have now expanded to global proportions. No longeris the market – or the occult – subject to limitations.Conclusion: structural adjustment, the occult and traffickingin human skinsI have argued that structural adjustment and the changes it has unleashed arethemselves responsible for the recent rise of occult idioms and practices acrossTanzania. There are two principle reasons for this. First, the fact that structuraladjustment presents itself and the changes it has wrought as categoricallyamoral, even though they are not, has compelled people to turn to alternative,more familiar registers – like the occult – to raise and debate the (im)moralitiesof recent changes. Second, the fact that structural adjustment has, by usingforeign aid carrots and sticks, indefatigably forced the ‘free’ market on Tanzaniansand led inescapably to the commodification of the occult itself. In making this argument my aim has been to unsettle one of modernity’scomfortable masternarratives, to show how and why – paceany number of socialtheorists – ‘modernizing’ forces in one particular time and place have generatedthe very ‘enchantments’ they should in theory eliminate. In this context, it isperhaps worth considering what or who, exactly, has been enchanted. For itappears that structural adjustment itself possesses untold powers of self-mystification which bespeak modernity’s many enchantments. Neither is itobvious that ‘the occult’ is some pre-logical, ‘traditional’, unchanging relic fromthe past that, against all odds, lives on in the present. On the contrary, recentdevelopments in Tanzania and elsewhere suggest that witchcraft and otheroccult forces and discourses are profoundly malleable, dynamic and modern,indicative of a deeply engaged collective imagination about the world andpeople’s place in it. Wherever it is found, the occult frequently provides amoralizing discourse of the moment. But how, to return to our initial questions, is trafficking in human skinimplicated in the magical generation of wealth?’ Why, just now, has human skintrading to occult ends so captured the Tanzanian popular imagination? Andwhat meaning could such things possibly have for the Ihanzu and others likethem, who have a symbolically and practically impoverished understanding ofthe precise mechanisms at work?Adjustment, morality and occult in Tanzania 177"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The answer is surprisingly straightforward. ‘Why not?’, lamented one elderlyIhanzu woman. ‘There are no limits to what people will do these days formoney’. No limits indeed – which brings us to the crux of the matter. Tanzanians’frenzied musings over the marketing of human skins for wealth production are, Isubmit, musings over the (il)logical conclusion of unbridled liberalization – aworld where everythingis commodified through and through, a world wheresociety, culture, history and humanity itself have fallen victim to the caprices ofThe Market. At issue here is ‘a fear of the creeping commodification of lifeitself. . . . of a relentless process that erodes the inalienable humanity of personsand renders them susceptible as never before to the long reach of the market’(Comaroff and Comaroff 1999: 291), indicative of ‘just how vulnerable peoplefeel in a system which they see as draining them of their resources to the benefitof remote others’ (Colson 2000: 341). These skins, corporeal tropes of sorts, arebeing traded to far-off, transnational places to the benefit of a few, at theexpense of many. If Mauss was correct in suggesting a relationship betweenindividual and social bodies, then we might say that Tanzania is losing her socialskin: it is being systematically traded away, obliterated in the name of prosperity,much as the skins of the unfortunate victims of the human skin trade. Structuraladjustment insists on free trade across Tanzania’s borders to enrich the nation;ruthless occult traders reputedly remove and sell human skins for personal gain.The magic of removing boundaries to generate wealth apparently works onmany levels. Human skins, in this sense, are plainly ‘good to think with’.Yet for many, these are stories less about skins than stories told with andthrough skins (cf. White 1997). At least for the Ihanzu, and presumably forothers, there is no ‘deep’ cultural logic to be uncovered about skins and magicalwealth production. In fact, it is precisely because such notions lack specificcultural moorings that they can become meaningful across such a vast region.Ihanzu collective groanings about an occult-related trafficking in human skinsare ruminations over the perverse extremes to which some Tanzanians areapparently prepared to go to get rich – or just to get by – in the new millen-nium’s deeply unsettling economic climate. The language itself is telling.‘Obnoxious’, ‘inhuman’, ‘grotesque’, ‘evil’, these terms recur in newspapers, onradio and television, and in the stories people tell around town, in the cities andin the villages about the human skin trade. These caustic commentaries point tothe potentially disastrous consequences of liberalization run amuck, to a particularpostcolonial (dis)order gone catastrophically wrong. They insist on interrogatingthe logic and limitations of liberalization, how trade is conducted and, most ofall, the parameters and desirability of vastly expanded social, political andeconomic horizons. These are all deeply moral issues about social change thatsterile development donor discourses studiously avoid.This does not mean that, through such occult ruminations, Tanzanians arenecessarily ‘resisting’ things modern. Across Tanzania and across Africa peopleare simultaneously taunted and tantalized by ‘modernity’. Its promises of prosperityfor all are too good to be ignored and, as many discover, too good to be true.178 Todd Sanders"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Instead, what Tanzanians and many others are after is an ‘indigenization ofmodernity, their own cultural space in the global scheme of things’ (Sahlins1999: 410; Piot 1999). This is a meaningful modernity, a modernity that makessense, a modernity on their own terms. And there is no other way to get it thanby raising and debating the morally troublesome questions that ‘modernity’ and‘development’ inevitably pose.In probing such questions, occult idioms provide few definitive answers. Theanswers to questions of who wins and who loses, of who is deprived and who isdepraved, of what is acceptable and what is not, are rarely straightforward. Aswe saw with Bonifasi and Maria, even the same this-worldly events may beinterpreted differently by different actors, suggesting that the (im)moralities ofsocial changes are at the very least murky. Even so, while ‘the occult’ may notanswer such complex questions, it nevertheless provides a persuasive idiom –one among several (e.g. Campbell and Stein 1992) – in which to raise, discussand debate them. Official stories of structural adjustment tell of a better life for all Tanzaniansfound in The Free Market, and in a world of expanded and expanding horizonsand opportunities that accompany it. This ‘opening up’ is natural, rational andso obviously amoral and desirable that it scarcely merits attention, let alonediscussion. From the sidelines, ordinary Tanzanians tell a decidedly differentstory of the present through and with human skins and the occult. This is apresent of ever-increasing uncertainty, where hard questions must be asked, andtough choices must be made. The fact that Tanzanians voice such concerns,albeit in different registers, makes one thing clear: we would do well toscrutinize ‘structural adjustment’, its decidedly cultural claims and its not alwayscongenial consequences, rather than denying that such things matter.

Clearlythey can, and do (Comaroff and Comaroff 2000). Rather the point is that ‘structuraladjustment’ presents itself as being principally about science and objectivity, and thusbeing amoral.8 Of late, Foucauldian-inspired approaches to ‘development’ (e.g. Escobar 1991; 1995;Ferguson 1994; Sachs 1992) have been criticized for presenting development discoursesas unduly monolithic and unchanging (Gardner and Lewis 2000: 19; Leach andFairhead 2000; Moore 1999: 656). I am not arguing that structural adjustment hasremained unchanged.

As we have shown, it is somewhatweakened by elementary education and Christian teaching; and we believethat its disappearance turns on increased technical control, particularly inthe field of disease, on scientific education, and on the development ofinterpersonal relations. (Wilson 1967 [1951]: 135)I do not believe in it [witchcraft] myself, but I do not have disdain for thepeople who believe in it like most of our society seems to have. I understandit from the cultural roots....We [the black consciousness movement] donot reject it. We regard it as part of the mystery of our cultural heritage. . . .Whites are not superstitious; whites do not have witches and witch doctors.We are the people who have this. (Biko cited in Woods 1978: 166–167)Belief in witchcraft and related practices form part of a basic cultural,traditional and customary principle of Africans in South Africa, and Africaas a whole.(Ralushai et al.1996: 45)In the Northern Province of South Africa the execution of suspected witcheshas reached alarming proportions. According to an informed estimate morethan 389 witchcraft-related killings occurred between 1985 and 1995.2In onegruelling episode during April 1986, members of the Sekhukhuneland YouthOrganisation ‘necklaced’ 43 alleged witches. Police uncovered their corpses inpits and in bushes. A man told reporters that he had seen his wife burnt to deathwhile her assailants sang ‘freedom songs’.3Such episodes raise the crucial questions: ‘What is to be done about witchcraftin the new South Africa?’, and, ‘What legislative changes can be implementedto end violence against alleged witches?’ As anthropologists we might imagineChapter 9Witchcraft in the new South AfricaFrom colonial superstition topostcolonial reality?1Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"that we are legislators, and formulate proposals we believe present satisfactorysolutions, but we seldom have real power to enforce our prescriptions. In anycase, I believe that there is no generally acceptable solution to this particularset of problems. Any action against witchcraft beliefs, witchcraft accusations,and the killing of witches is based on prior assumptions about the meaningand morality of these phenomena. It is unlikely that a consensus would emergebetween those who perceive witchcraft as a real danger, those who regardwitchcraft as superstition, and others for whom witchcraft beliefs, but not witch-killings, have positive value. In a fundamental sense, witchcraft involves politicalcontestation. Under these circumstances the anthropologist might well makea more appropriate intervention by elucidating cultural meanings and politicsthat are encoded in actions on witchcraft and by assessing their likelyconsequences.4Against the backdrop of these assumptions this chapter provides a criticaloverview of the Ralushai Commission of inquiry into witchcraft.5The Commis-sion was appointed in March 1995 by the Executive Council of the NorthernProvince to investigate the causes of witchcraft-related violence; to reviewcriminal cases pertaining to witchcraft over the previous ten years; andto recommend measures to be undertaken by government to combat suchviolence. I shall comment on the report in the light of novel ways of dealingwith witchcraft that have emerged elsewhere in postcolonial Africa, and withreference to my own ethnographic fieldwork conducted in the Bushbuckridgearea of the Northern Province for intermittent periods from 1990 until thepresent.6Dederen (1996) criticizes the Ralushai report for failing to meet the require-ments of rigorous academic research and writing. He describes the report asbased on dubious fieldwork; as poorly edited and structured; flawed by theinclusion of unsourced facts from the literature; as containing rare attempts atthe critical analysis of data, and as including many unresolved contradictions.The report, he asserts, ‘fails to probe beyond the veil of mystery created byaccounts of witches, witch-familiars, and zombies’ (Dederen 1996: 3). While I share Dederen’s reservations about the scholarly merits of the report,I do not believe that we can underestimate its political significance. I endeavourto show that the Ralushai report presents an important shift in official discoursesabout witchcraft. I argue that during the eras of segregation and apartheid –from about 1900 to 1994 – the civilizing mission of colonialism that demandedthe eradication of witchcraft informed the state’s position on witchcraft. Bycontrast, the ideas expressed in the Ralushai report signal the advent of counter-colonial discourses in the post-apartheid era – since 1994. The new discourses‘subvert the self-confident rationality of imperial science’ (Ranger 1996: 271),accept witchcraft as real, and appropriate it as a marker of African identity. Yet Isuggest that the official recognition of witchcraft is by no means unambiguous:new lines of contestation are likely to emerge as witchcraft becomes embroiledin politics of African nationalism.Witchcraft in the new South Africa 185"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Colonialism, apartheid, and witchcraftDuring the eras of segregation and apartheid the civilizing mission of colonialismdemanded no compromise with any belief or practice pertaining to witchcraft.These were perceived as repugnant, baseless, and even as diabolic pagansuperstitions, which are deeply ingrained in the lives of ‘primitive people’, andwill only disappear with the spread of western civilization, education, andChristianity.7Colonial states also saw the prosecution of witches as a challengeto their authority. In the early colonial period, colonial regimes made a concerted effort toend the trials of witches. The German administration of Tanganyika (nowTanzania) hanged several diviners for naming a person as a witch, who was laterkilled, and also condemned the killers to death (Mesaki 1994: 50). Britishadministrations outlawed well-known methods of determining witches’ guiltsuch as the poison ordeal.8In pre-colonial Africa, witchcraft was a crime. Forcolonial rulers, it was a superstition, and the African judges and executioners ofwitches became murderers (Fields 1982: 572). Since about 1900, British colonial administrations systematized the legalcontrol of witchcraft throughout Africa. They enacted a series of laws thatprohibited witchcraft accusation and attempts to practise witchcraft. These lawswere, however, implemented with different degrees of severity. In NorthernRhodesia (now Zambia) people pretending to be witches, witch-finders, andeven those who commented that illness was caused by ‘non-natural’ meanscould be fined £50 and/or be imprisoned for three years. In terms of the 1922Witchcraft Ordinance of Tanganyika, the High Court could impose fines of upto £200 and/or prison sentences of up to five years. Ugandans could even bepunished for wearing charms.9In South Africa, the Suppression of Witchcraft Act No. 3 of 1957, asamended in 1970, consolidated earlier colonial laws into unified legislation forthe whole country.10In terms of the Act, anyone who indicates another personas being a witch, or attempts to practise witchcraft, can be fined up to R2,000,imprisoned for up to ten years, and/or whipped up to ten strokes. If a personaccused of witchcraft was killed, the perpetrator could be jailed for up to twentyyears. A second category of offenders are persons who approach ‘witch-doctors’to ‘smell out’ others as witches; advise others how to bewitch, supply them withthe ‘pretended means of witchcraft’, or attempt to put into operation processescalculated to injure other people or things. These offenders can be sentenced toa fine not exceeding R500 and/or imprisoned for a period not exceeding fiveyears. Even those who claim to possess the powers of divination can be finedR200 or imprisoned for two years.In practice, however, the manner in which colonial states dealt withwitchcraft often contradicted the ideals of the civilizing mission. Fields (1982)suggests that colonial regimes could not afford large-scale policing to rule solelyby force. Nor was there sufficient commonality between the rulers and the ruled186 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"that would have enabled the exercise of legitimate authority. In this context,she argues, order could only be sustained by not upsetting routine ways ofthinking and behaving. Hence the maintenance of African authorities,redeployment of African institutions, and preservation of indigenous culture,thus became paradoxical conditions for achieving the civilizing mission (Fields1982: 569).11In South Africa such ambiguities were pronounced. Whilst the NationalParty government certainly possessed the coercive capacities to enforce adherenceto the Suppression of Witchcraft Act, the segregationist policy of apartheidostensibly ensured African self-government. As in the case of British indirectadministration, the South African state reserved land for exclusive Africanoccupation, and allowed chiefs to enforce ‘Native law and custom’ on a dailybasis. In Parliament, speakers of the United Party opposition pointed out that by‘reverting to the tribal system’ government impeded that progress towardscivilization that would lead to the demise of witchcraft.12In Bushbuckridge, Northern Sotho and Tsonga-speakers were guaranteedrights of residence beneath the Moholoholo mountains by the 1913 Land Act,and by the proclamation of Native Reserves and Bantustans. In such areas Act38 of 1927 entrenched the authority of chiefs over their subjects. Such juridicalautonomy enabled chiefs to accede to the demand by villagers for the control ofwitches. Out of sight and earshot of the Native Commissioners, chiefs triedcases that touched on witchcraft, and mediated in witchcraft accusations amongcommoners. Chiefs authorized witch-diviners to determine the guilt of theaccused, condoned the ritual humiliation of those identified as witches, andensured that the bewitched were compensated in cattle for the crimes committedagainst them. Chiefs and their councillors also sought out and punished witcheswho stopped rain. By managing misfortune in this way and by protecting theirsubjects from harm, chiefs tapped a potent source of political legitimacy.The Native Commissioners seemed to have ignored these infringements,perhaps because they involved minimal violence. Only with the establishmentof Bantu Authorities in 1958 did chiefs become more directly accountable toBantu Affairs Commissioners. This, and also the unfortunate killing of a manwho had allegedly bewitched chief Seganyane II in 1959, placed chiefs undergreater pressure to comply with the stipulations of the Suppression of WitchcraftAct. But chiefs and headmen still occasionally intervened in cases of suspectedwitchcraft, in defiance of the Commissioners. The position of the colonial state was, moreover, not without ambiguity.Mesaki (1994: 50) comments that colonial laws did allow the accusers formallyto bring charges of witchcraft before magistrates and the courts. The BritishWitchcraft Ordinances of 1928 and 1958 empowered District Officers to deportalleged witches to specific localities. Moreover, line officers of the colonialadministrations often revised formulations of the witchcraft laws when imple-menting them.13Fields (1982: 85) notes that the bamcapiwitch-cleansingmovement, which swept large parts of central Africa in the 1930s, led toWitchcraft in the new South Africa 187"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"manifold violations of the witchcraft laws, colonial administrators maintaining apolicy of ‘watchful tolerance’ and allowing chiefs to have their localitiescleansed. Occasionally, the officers themselves utilized ‘traditional expertise’ todeal with witchcraft. In the 1940s, increased witchcraft accusations promptedthe District Commissioner of Ulanga, Tanganyika, to send mgangato conductmass shavings. (These were thought to suppress the powers of witches and toprotect people against bewitchment.) Within village communities a perceptioneven arose that colonial governments had appointed anti-witchcraft specialistsfor purposes of development (Green 1994: 29).Officers of the South African government, too, could not consistently ignorewitchcraft beliefs. In the 1950s, a prominent chief of the Eastern Cape com-plained to the Chief Native Commissioner that a man had been seen ridingaround his kraal at midnight, mounted on a baboon. The Commissioner savedthe alleged witch from serious injury by having him removed to anotherdistrict.14Since the early 1990s the South African Police Service have regularlyintervened in accusations of witchcraft in Bushbuckridge and have protectedthe accused from harm by confining them to a locality behind the Acornhoekpolice station (Niehaus 1998). The Ralushai Commission of inquiry documentscases elsewhere in which police officers have actually investigated allegations ofwitchcraft. For example, in 1994 police took statements after a 5-year-old boyhad disappeared from his home in the Tafelkop area of Lebowa. The boyreturned to his parents with a cut on his foot. Inside the wound was a smallstone, a piece of wood and herbal substances. The boy’s nails and hair had beencut, and he claimed that a man had pushed a piece of wire into his penis. On 27January 1995 teachers in Lebowa complained to the police that a soot-likesubstance was sprinkled into a schoolgirl’s food. The police sent the food to theForensic Chemistry Laboratories in Johannesburg for analysis, but no toxicsubstances could be detected. Neither case resulted in an arrest (Ralushai et al.1996: 99, 188–190). During the apartheid era the Suppression of Witchcraft Act was implementedvery inconsistently in areas currently comprising the Northern Province. TheRalushai Commission compiled 211 cases relating to witchcraft that appeared inpolice dockets or that were brought before the courts between 1985 and 1995.Very few of these cases resulted in prosecutions in terms of the Act, and thesentences that were imposed on those who were tried and convicted were veryuneven. Only 47 (25 per cent) of the 190 persons accused of having namedothers as witches, and of having threatened them with violence, were foundguilty.15Suspended sentences were given to 9; 1 was sentenced to receivestrokes with a light cane, 5 were sentenced to imprisonment (for periods varyingfrom three to ten months); and 32 to an option of a fine or imprisonment(ranging from R60 or two months, to R1,000 or twelve months). Of the 230persons accused of having perpetrated violence against alleged witches 71(31 per cent) were prosecuted for contravening the Act, or for commonassault, attempted murder, malicious damage to property, or arson.16Suspended188 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"sentences were given to 21; 8, strokes with a light cane; 4 were ordered to payR175 in damages; 5 sentenced to imprisonment (for periods of between threemonths and two years); and 33 given the option of a fine or imprisonment(ranging from R30 or ten days, to R1,000 or eight months.) Between 1985 and 1995 the courts prosecuted 109 (52 per cent) of the 209persons accused of participating in witch-killings.17Suspended sentences weregiven to 12; 4, strokes with a light cane; and 84 were imprisoned (for periodsvarying from 18 months to life). Judges often treated the belief in witchcraft asan extenuating circumstance. In the case of Statev. Mathabi, Justice van derWalt considered sentencing to death four accused who had pleaded guilty tomurder but he accepted their claim that they had thought the deceased was awitch and reduced the penalty to five years’ imprisonment, of which two yearswere suspended.18Witchcraft beliefs were also treated as a suitable ground for appeal, and attimes their recognition contributed to the passage of very light sentences. In1985 Neledzani Netshiavha was woken by a scratching sound on his door. Hepicked up an axe, walked outside, and chopped down an animal hanging on therafters of his roof. After it fell to the ground, Neledzani chopped it a second anda third time. Villagers, who came to see the ‘animal’, described it as a donkeyor a large bat, but it later assumed the shape of an elderly man who was areputed witch. Neledzani had killed this man. A judge of the Venda SupremeCourt sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment for culpable homicide. TheBloemfontein Appeal Court, however, reduced his sentence to four years.19In1991, six men who had stoned and burnt to death four alleged witches, wereconvicted of the murder, but sentenced to only five years’ imprisonment, whollysuspended on condition that they underwent 100 hours’ community service.20Hence the tensions between the civilizing mission of colonialism and systemsof indirect rule such as apartheid were profound. Such tensions gave rise tovarious contradictions and ambiguities that undermined the efforts of the SouthAfrican State to act decisively against witchcraft beliefs. In certain respectslegislation such as the Suppression of Witchcraft Act No. 3 of 1957, was moreimportant as a symbolic statement of the state’s ideological commitment tomodernization, than as a legislative attempt to eradicate witchcraft accusations.Postcolonial critics of the civilizing mission seldom give sufficient weight tothese contradictions. Regulating witchcraft in post-apartheid South AfricaIndependence saw increased agitation in many parts of Africa that the stateshould no longer remain indifferent to witchcraft. Some African intellectuals,who perceive witchcraft as real, have even reproached the courts for refusing tosentence witches. However, postcolonial governments have not responded in auniform manner. While governments, such as those of Tanzania, retained thecolonial outlook and legislation (Abrahams 1994), state courts in CameroonWitchcraft in the new South Africa 189"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"have freely convicted witches (Fisiy and Geschiere 1990), and in Malawi asystem of ‘traditional’ courts have dealt with witchcraft (Motshekga 1984: 12–13).Independence thus inaugurated new lines of contestation. The report of the Ralushai Commission, which is likely to be a centrepiece inofficial debates about witchcraft in the new South Africa, presents a decisivebreak from the civilizing mission of colonialism. It is informed by the worksof John Mbiti, a theologian; Gordon Chavunduka, former Principal of theUniversity of Zimbabwe, and President of the Zimbabwe National TraditionalHealers’ Association (ZINATHA); and Mathole Motshekga, a legal scholar.These influences are apparent in lengthy citations and in some passages thatfollow the sources very closely.Mbiti (1970: 9–10) castigates the colonial assumption that witchcraft is amyth which only exists in the mind of the ignorant, and appropriates it as amarker of African identity. He asserts that witchcraft is a traditional religiousconcept that continues to dominate the background of African people. Chavunduka (1982: 4) finds the definition of witchcraft, by Rhodesian law, as‘the throwing of bones, use of charms and other devices’ to be misplaced. TheNdebele and Shona terms umthakatiand muroyirather denote troublemakers,poisoners, and those who eat corpses, dance naked and cause misfortune.Chavunduka concedes that some claims – such as the one that witches can fly –are purely mythical, but he insists that other activities could be factual(Scheper-Hughes 2000). Poisoning has been verified by the examination ofsubstances. Confessions about witchcraft, with a striking degree of corroborationbetween witnesses, are also commonplace.21For example, three women separatelystated in court that they killed the husband of one woman by feeding him roots,snake skin, and powder from a lion’s heart, in his sleep (Chavunduka 1982: 13).Since the witnesses were not forced to confess, nor were they insane, and couldnot possibly have dreamt the same dream, Chavunduka concludes that suchstatements could be valid. Verbal threats and the placing of objects in footpathscan also have deadly consequences. The belief that one had been bewitchedmight induce prolonged tension, shock, a fall in blood pressure, and food refusal– leading to death.22While Chavunduka acknowledges that the laws preventinnocent people from being accused, he asserts that they do not solve theproblem of witchcraft. ‘It is as if one were to tell a physician engaged in publichealth work that he could eradicate malaria by merely denying its existence’(Chavunduka 1982: 19). Motshekga (1984) claims that in assessing blame for criminal cases involvingwitchcraft, colonial courts model their judgements on European standards of‘reasonableness’. He cites the example of a Kenyan court that, in 1922,sentenced 70 men to death for killing an old woman whom they believed tohave been a witch. Likewise, a South African court convicted a male youth ofculpable homicide. He had lived in a community haunted by the tikoloshe,entered a hut, and dealt several blows to the supposed tikoloshewith a hatchet.When he dragged it out he discovered that he had killed a small child, his190 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"nephew.23In both cases judges rejected claims by the defence that the accusedhad acted in ‘imaginary self-defence’, and argued that witchcraft cannot berecognized by English or Roman Dutch law.24Motshekga notes that the judge-ments did not express a humanitarian concern for the reformation of criminals,but a utilitarian objective of effecting social change through exemplary deterrence.He contends, however, that existing laws have hitherto proven ineffective ineradicating the blight of witchcraft (Motshekga 1984: 11).These scholars advocate a new legal approach, in which Africans are judgedby African norms, and witchcraft comes under the purview of the law.Chavunduka and Motshekga envisage an important role for ‘traditional courts’.Chavunduka (1982: 17) proposes that traditional courts should deal with thesocial aspects of witchcraft accusations, reconcile the disputing parties, andencourage deviants to conform; while formal courts should focus on the legalaspects of such cases.25Motshekga (1984) commends the Malawian system oftraditional courts. He cites the example of a man who, in 1974, threatened tosend a swarm of bees to the hostel where a schoolgirl lived, and to bury‘medicines’ at the entrance to cause all the schoolgirls to run amok. After anoutbreak of mass hysteria at the hostel, a Malawian traditional court found himguilty of imitating witchcraft. Motshekga (1984: 13) regards this judgement as‘exemplary’, but regrets that the Malawian courts admit only to the ‘pretence’ ofwitchcraft. The membership of the Ralushai Commission ensured a wide representationof African voices, previously unheard in the formulation of witchcraft laws. Thecommissioners, who were headed by Prof. Ralushai (a social anthropologist andretired deputy principal of the University of Venda) also included Prof. vanHeerden (a professor of law), Pastor Masingi (a former magistrate), Mr Ndou(an attorney), Mr Mphaphuli (a chief), Mr Mathiba (President of a SouthAfrican Council of Traditional Healers), Ms Madiba (a theologian), Brig.Mokwena (of the South African Police), and Mr Matabane (a former ANCrepresentative in Washington).Their lengthy report (288 pages) consists of data generated from fieldwork,some recommendations, and 150 pages of court material, pictures, andmaps. The commissioners undertook what Dederen (1996: 1) calls a ‘magicalmystery tour’ to interview representatives of 173 communities (includingAcornhoek) and 43 different organizations. The latter were associations fordingaka (diviner/herbalists), churches, health workers, policemen, civic organ-izations, chiefs, students, and political parties. They also attended eight peacerallies, and three rallies of chiefs. These investigations enabled the authors toclaim that the belief in witches is virtually omnipresent among Africans.Educated people reportedly cited Shakespeare to justify their beliefs. Zionistchurch members quoted Exodus 22, Deuteronomy 18, and Acts 8. Only theleaders of European-controlled churches ‘condemned witchcraft beliefs in thelanguage of the missionaries’, and spokespersons for a few isolated communitiesdoubted the existence of zombies (p. 18). Witchcraft in the new South Africa 191"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"In presenting this data the commissioners dissolve the spectrum of opinioninto impersonal phrases, such as ‘it is believed’ (Dederen 1996: 1). This mode ofpresentation supports the report’s contention that witchcraft is an expressionof a uniform and unique African culture. Though Indians marginally participatein these practices – for example by selling dihlare(herbal potions) to Africans –whites are neither perceived to be the perpetrators or victims of witchcraft (p. 25).By consistently using atemporal concepts, such as ‘traditional’, the authors alsorepresent witchcraft as primordial, and obscure changes in belief. The reportstates that: ‘our forefathers regarded witchcraft as an integral part of our lives’;‘traditionally’ mainly women were accused; ‘traditional healers’ sniffed outwitches; and ‘traditional courts’ punished witches by shaving their heads,imposing fines, drowning them, or by roasting them in fires (pp. 13, 21, 28). Theauthors claim that traditional beliefs moulded Christianity rather than viceversa. Religious teaching reportedly had little impact, and church people ‘stilladhere to traditional beliefs relating to witchcraft and the ancestors’ (p. 50). Inshort the authors invoke the past to explain the present.The report only contains a short description of contemporary witchcraftbeliefs. Witches inherit a craving for evil-doing from the maternal side, or buypoisons from ‘traditional healers’ (p. 23). The deeds ascribed to them includethe uttering of life-threatening curses; the causing of misfortune, illness, abortions,and death; and the sending of lightning to destroy people’s property. Numerousfamiliars and items of witchcraft are listed, but their symbolic meanings are leftunexplored (p. 22).26There is also hardly any mention of wealth, reproduction,and fertility. The authors insinuate that these beliefs are factual with reference to twoperplexing accounts of zombies.27In one account four naked women called aman from his sleep, and took him to a tree where they forced him to drink‘medicine’ that tasted like oil. At a house he was shown people who had diedlong ago. Villagers later found the man in a kraal (p. 18). Another accountconcerns Jack Mafikeng, an alleged zombie, who returned to his family 25 yearsafter he was buried (p. 19). The authors contemplate no alternative explan-ations for these events.The report none the less condemns the recent witch-hunts and killings as‘senseless’, ‘brutal’, ‘uncivilized’ and ‘barbaric’ (Ralushai et al.1996: 62, 121,270). It is estimated that at least 389 alleged witches were killed between 1985and 1995. This figure is acknowledged to be a vast underestimate, as manyrespondents were reluctant to give information about the killings in fear ofvictimization. The authors also condemn the destruction of the homes of allegedwitches, their banishment, and the refusal to allow their children to attendschool. The report does not offer a clear explanation for the violence, but lays blameat the door of the entire community. Male youths, known as Comrades, arerecognized to have been at the forefront of the violence, and it is acknowledgedthat political motives were sometimes involved. The execution of witches was192 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"apparently informed by the killing of ‘political undesirables’ in the urban areas,and aimed to discredit Bantustan governments and chiefs who had becomeupholders of apartheid (Ralushai et al.1996: 32). However, the authors arguethat adults manipulated the youth. Adults reportedly delegated responsibility forpunishing witches to the youth because the courts treat juvenile offenders moreleniently (Ralushai et al.1996: 32). In fact, the authors suggest that localcommunities saw the youth as ‘heroes and protectors’.‘Traditional healers’, who sniff out witches on the receipt of money, areidentified as key actors in the commission of these crimes (Ralushai et al.1996:29). The authors none the less empathize with the healers, and explain howyouths forced many healers to point out witches. Despite the missionaries’ con-demnation of traditional healing, they observe that there are about 10,000healers in Johannesburg whom 85 per cent of black households occasionallyconsult (Ralushai et al.1996: 47). Most inherit their skills from their ancestors,are clean and well-educated. Current disarray in the practice is seen to resultfrom improper control by rival associations of healers, with conflicting rules ofconduct. The associations do not always ensure that their members are wellqualified, and clients who are exploited cannot lodge complaints to theassociations. The authors criticize law enforcement agencies as ineffective. Due to theconcentration of police stations in white residential areas during the apartheidyears, African rural areas are deprived of effective policing. The arrests of witch-killers has also been impeded by the fact that existing police stations aremanned by the members of local communities, who are reluctant to investigatecases which involve their relatives. Many police believe in witchcraft and feelthat witches impose an unnecessary burden on them. Moreover, the courts havenot been able to build strong cases because witnesses are reluctant to testify.Consequently, serious offenders are easily released. For the authors the Suppression of Witchcraft Act is an unacceptable solutionto the problems of witchcraft and witch-killings. Respondents perceived the Actas unjust because it does not aim to punish witches, but those who name othersas witches. Some condoned the killings. Others felt that witches should be keptin special places, perhaps with the wild animals in the Kruger National Park(Ralushai et al.1996: 17). ‘Traditionalists’ believed the ‘old order’ should berestored, and that chiefs and diviners should be empowered to deal with witch-craft. ‘Modernists’ felt witch-killings should be ended by means of education,the church, and the mass media (Ralushai et al.1996: 15).The Commission makes the following recommendations: 1EducationIt urges government to embark upon a programme of educationthat would ‘liberate people mentally’, so that they would refrain fromperpetrating violence against witches. Workshops, rallies, music competi-tions,and media programmes should be organized to show the futility ofwitch purges; and ‘experts on African customs’ should design courses inWitchcraft in the new South Africa 193"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"school syllabi (Ralushai et al.1996: 60). The report emphasizes that churchescan play a valuable role, and commends the Zion Christian Church whoformed their own commission of inquiry into witchcraft. The Zion ChristianChurch assured the Member of the Executive Council for Safety andSecurity of their co-operation in the fight against witchcraft-related violence,stated that they disapproved of consultations with dingaka, and condemnedthe use of violence for political purposes (Ralushai et al.1996: 50).2ResearchAccording to the Commission, the development of sound policieson witch-killings requires more accurate information. Legal experts andeminent scholars – such as Gordon Chavunduka and Jean La Fontaine –should be invited to participate in educational programmes. The policeshould regularly submit more reliable statistics to the Member of theExecutive Council (MEC) for Safety and Security, and witchcraft should beresearched on a more regular basis. ‘Our universities, specifically the historic-ally black universities, should embark upon an intensive research programdealing with witchcraft and ritual killings as most students in these univers-ities come from communities in which these practices are still prevalent’(p. 62).3Legislative ChangesThe report proposes that the Suppression of WitchcraftAct be repealed and replaced by a Witchcraft Control Act. In terms of thenew Act, those who practise witchcraft would receive the harshest punish-ments. Any person who creates ‘reasonable suspicion’ that he/she practiseswitchcraft; puts into operation any process, which is calculated to damageanother person or thing, professes knowledge of witchcraft, advises anotherperson how to bewitch, or supplies him/her with the ‘means of witchcraft’would be liable to imprisonment for up to four years and/or a fine of up toR4,000. Persons who ‘without any reasonable or justifiable cause’ name, oremploy ‘witch-doctors’ to indicate another person as a witch, would beliable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding R3,000 and/or a prisonsentence not exceeding three years. People who collect money to employ‘witch-doctors’ to indicate others as witches, or force ‘witch-doctors’ toindicate other persons as witches, would be liable to a fine of up to R2,000and/or imprisoned for up to two years. 4The Control of Traditional Medical PractitionersThe Commission proposesthat, as in Zimbabwe (Chavunduka 1986), a Traditional Medical Practi-tioners’ Council be established to regulate the practice of ‘traditional healers’in the Northern Province. The council is to be a corporate body comprisingtwelve members – a chairman, vice chairman, five members elected by trad-itional healers, and five members appointed by the Minister.28The Ministershall also appoint a registrar to serve as secretary of the council, with theright to dismiss councillors who fail to comply with their duties. The proposedcouncil is to maintain a register of traditional healers and to hold inquiriesfor purposes of the Act (Ralushai et al.1996: 66). Only registered healerswould be allowed to practise for gain and to use the title ‘Traditional194 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Medical Practitioner’ or ‘Spirit Medium’. If found guilty of improperconduct the healer could be ordered to pay a fine, suspended, or expelled.Unregistered healers who practise for gain, falsify certificates, or use unauth-orised titles could be fined up to R2,000 and/or be imprisoned for two years.The Commission also proposes that a National Traditional Healers’Association, headed by an executive of 25 members, be established to uniteall ‘traditional healers’, ‘spirit mediums’ and ‘faith healers’ into one body. Itsaims would be to prevent quackery, promote traditional medicine and thebeneficial aspects of African culture, and to co-operate with ministries andother organizations involved in the field of health.Dederen (1996: 6) describes these proposals as too vague and general to qualifyas meaningful solutions. He laments the lack of specific information about theeducational programmes and questions whether the condemnation of witchcraft-related violence by churches would have much of an effect, particularly in thelight of the earlier assertion that religious teachings have had little influence onwitchcraft beliefs. Dederen states that it remains an unresolved riddle how theWitchcraft Control Act would counter witchcraft-related violence whilenurturing the very ideologies in which they are rooted. To these criticisms one can add that the proposals make no reference to thestatus of the courts of chiefs. Neither do they address the question of evidence.How would ‘reasonable suspicion’ of practising witchcraft, or ‘justifiable cause’for naming another person as a witch, be determined? For example, could asimilar solution be adopted as the one in the East Province of Cameroon wherediviners are allowed to act as key witnesses in state courts (Fisiy 1990; Fisiy andGeschiere 1990, 1996)? The proposals about traditional healers do not specificallyrefer to the pointing out of witches. The inclusion of the distinctivelyZimbabwean category ‘spirit medium’, and the lack of any distinction betweendiviners and witch-diviners, raises further concern. So does the neglect ofwitchcraft attributions by Christian prophets, and the assumption that Christianhealers would sedately accept membership of a national body for ‘traditionalmedical practitioners’. Witchcraft as postcolonial dilemma Though not a blueprint for action, the Ralushai report none the less indicates ageneral direction in the formulation of policy that might guard against the worstpitfalls that have arisen from modernization strategies embarked upon elsewherein Africa, such as in Tanzania. After independence, the Tanzanian governmentvigorously implemented ujamaavillagization schemes and replaced chiefs withappointed officials. They retained the British witchcraft laws to demonstratetheir opposition to the whole complex of beliefs and practices, and made hardlyany official provision for witchcraft accusations. This strategy has had disastrouseffects, and has led to fierce contestation between village communities and theWitchcraft in the new South Africa 195"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"state. In the absence of any institutional support, Tanzanian villagers haveresorted to self-help to eradicate witchcraft. In Sukumaland 3,072 witch-killingsoccurred between 1970 and 1988. Yet state courts have only prosecuted sevenpeople for these killings (Mesaki 1994: 52). In the 1970s, 12 people died whenthe security personnel of Sukumaland rounded up 897 suspected witches andcriminals. In response the Tanzanian government imprisoned four police officers,forced two Regional Commissioners and two Ministers to resign, and threatenedto take severe actions against the diviners who continued to identify witches(Mesaki 1994: 57). Yet these repressive actions did not have the desired outcome.In the 1980s the killings resumed, as Sungusungu vigilante groups arrogated theauthority for administering justice (Bukurura 1994).Evidence from Bushbuckridge, South Africa, shows a correlation betweenthe non-recognition of witchcraft by political authorities and the advent ofwitch-killings. Hardly any killings occurred before the 1960s, when nearly allchiefs actively mediated in witchcraft accusations between commoners. Chiefsencouraged household heads to report suspected witches to their courts. Whenhearing a witchcraft case, the chiefs required both the accuser and the accusedto deposit a stake of five cattle for safekeeping at the royal kraal. The chief andeach party then elected representatives to accompany the accused to a witch-diviner in Phundu Malia, near Venda. (They walked the entire distance, 200kilometres, each way.) If the witch-diviner pronounced the accused to be awitch, he would cut holes into his or her clothes and would shave his or her hairin a rough manner. The accuser would then collect the cattle from the royalkraal. If the accused was found not guilty, he or she blew a goat’s horn uponentering the village, and would be awarded cattle in compensation for beingwrongfully accused.29This measure dissipated the accusers desire for vengeance,and gave those accused of witchcraft a chance to prove their innocence. In the 1960s growing dependence on migrant labour, villagization, and theemergence of new forms of inequality heightened suspicions of witchcraft. Theimplementation of Bantu Authorities exacerbated these problems. When chiefswere prohibited from intervening in witchcraft, a perception arose that chiefssided with witches. This, paradoxically, brought about greater violence asvillagers took justice into their own hands and took revenge against those whomthey suspected of witchcraft. The prosecution of witch-killers only enhancedconflict between villagers and government. In 1986, political activists, known asComrades, exploited popular discontent, and killed more than 36 suspectedwitches in an attempt to eliminate evil, and so to attain legitimacy as a politicalmovement. Indeed, these attacks became linked to a broader challenge to thestate’s control of local government, the courts, and schools (see Delius 1996;Niehaus 1993; Ritchken 1995; Van Kessel 1993).The unbanning of the ANC in 1990 did not bring an end to witchcraftaccusations or to witch killings.30Yet it is significant that no loss of life occurredin the public witch-hunts that took place during the period of my fieldwork. Inthese dramas alternative forms of punishment came into play. For example, in196 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"December 1990, after several mysterious deaths occurred in the village of GreenValley, Comrades took about 100 suspects to a witch-diviner in Mbuzini, nearSwaziland. Thirty-five elders were identified as witches and were rituallypunished – they were beaten behind the neck with a switch, were commanded toundress, painted with black oil, and their hair was shaven in a rough manner.31At home ANC leaders ensured that no further harm was done to the allegedwitches, but forced them to burn their herbs.32Six years later Patrick Mnisi, aresident of Rooiboklaagte who worked as a malaria control officer at theDepartment of Health, started a truck to collect the other workers from work.Only 100 metres from his home two armed men stopped the truck, shot Patrickdead, and fled into a nearby forest. After Patrick’s death rumours circulated thathe had been a notorious witch and that the kin of his victims had hired theassailants. In contrast to the Green Valley witch-hunt in this case, the accusers’desire for vengeance found expression in homicide.While the institutional provision for witchcraft accusations may well suppresswitch-killings in the short term, experiences in the East Province of Cameroonshow that state intervention too can have dire consequences. Here individualswho protest their innocence have been imprisoned for periods of ten years onthe basis of testimony provided by certified diviners (nkong). Diviners have alsosearched the homes of suspects for evidence and dragged them before the courts.Fisiy and Geschiere (1990) see this practice as indicative of deepeningeconomic inequalities and of a novel alliance between state elites and thediviners. Since independence, elites have relied on the occult powers (djambe)of diviners to strengthen their positions, outwit their rivals, and to mediatebetween them and judges. In the eyes of the elite, witchcraft presents an anti-modern barrier to progress. Those convicted of witchcraft have invariably beenthe less fortunate who supposedly attack successful persons out of envy.33Ordinary villagers, who are alienated from the process of accusation, continue tofear witchcraft. They view the diviners as ambivalent figures, who can only helpagainst witchcraft because they too are representatives of djambe.By recognizingdiviners the government has thus strengthened the very forces it tries to combat(Fisiy and Geschiere 1990: 153). Villagers fear that the destructive tendencies ofthe divinersmay get the upper hand. They also perceive imprisonment as anineffective sanction because witches can learn new forms of witchcraft in jail.This diverges from their expectation that the nkongshould render the powers ofwitches harmless. As in Cameroon, witchcraft accusations in the Bushbuckridge area of SouthAfrica are intimately related to deepening economic inequalities. Since the1960s these accusations increased dramatically, partly due to the implemen-tation of villagization schemes that made people completely dependent uponmigrant labour. The greater inequities of a migrant labour economy were fertilebreeding grounds for feelings of envy and resentment, and for suspicions ofwitchcraft. Residents of Bushbuckridge conceive of witchcraft as the destructivepower of the subordinate. According to villagers, witches were deprived, marginal,Witchcraft in the new South Africa 197"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"and poorer persons, who were so envious and resentful that they attacked morefortunate kin and neighbours. My analysis of 291 witchcraft accusations in thevillage of Green Valley in Bushbuckridge shows that 18 (6 per cent) occurredbetween cognates, 120 (42 per cent) between relatives by marriage, and 153 (53per cent) between non-kin. Those accused have primarily been neglectedparents, siblings who have been deprived of their inheritance, wives who sufferexcessive domination, affines with no rights to the children of their daughters,jilted lovers, and unsuccessful neighbours who fail to make ends meet. Villagersbelieved that any sign of success could motivate attacks from enviousneighbours. For example, when Florence Nokeri took her ill child to a diviner,she was told that a noise at her home attracted the attention of her neighbours.Florence asked the diviner whether it could be the music system that herhusband had recently purchased. The diviner replied, ‘Yes. This can make sucha sound. Be careful! Your neighbours are on your heels!’ Witchcraft accusations have reinforced rather than challenged socialprivilege. Persons of relatively greater status and influence could manipulatethis cultural fantasy to their own advantage. By accusing poorer neighboursof witchcraft, educated young men who held well-paid jobs defended socialinequality. They legitimated their own success and defined their neighbours’desires for a better life as illegitimate and evil. After he had obtained a BAdegree from the University of the North, Ruben Malatsi held an ostentatiousgraduation party, but did not invite Ena Sekgobela his next-door neighbourwho was much poorer than himself. When Ena asked whether she couldsee Rubin’s cake, his sister believed that Ena wanted to poison the cake andchased her away. In this manner witchcraft accusations excused uncharitablebehaviour. Stadler (1994) and Comaroff and Comaroff (1999) correctly highlight thegenerational dimensions of witchcraft in South Africa. The supposed victims ofwitchcraft have often been youngsters, and the most notable perpetrators ofviolence against witches – the Comrades – are predominantly initiated butunmarried men. In contrast, those whom they have accused of witchcraft havepredominantly been middle-aged and elderly persons. This pattern of accus-ations does not diverge from the above-mentioned inequalities. Whilst theComrades, themselves, might well be poor and unemployed, the local characterof the struggle was such as to give them considerable political power. Eldershave become politically subordinate. Their power of adulthood slips away intoinfertility and infirmity, and their status rests purely on their control of esotericknowledge (cf. Heald 1986). The association of elders with witchcraft reflectsperceptions of increasing political marginalization. Hence, as in the case of Cameroon, it is likely that in the condoning ofwitchcraft accusations the South African state would entrench social inequality.Moreover, in the South African lowveld the regulation from above of diviners –who have until now derived their powers from ancestors and alien spirits ratherthan from political authorities – could fundamentally alter their basis of198 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"legitimacy.34It could also accord the Minister, who would effectively becomethe chief of all diviners, new powers in the realm of the occult.ConclusionsThe control of witchcraft by postcolonial states may well be as ambiguous andimpractical as the suppression of witchcraft was in colonial times. Postcolonialdiscourses have, in important ways, failed to transcend the central assumptionsof the colonial civilizing mission, which is that witchcraft is a residual survivalof a preliterate African culture. In the postcolonial vision of the RalushaiCommission, beliefs in witchcraft are no longer stigmatized, but are still amarker of a unique and primordial African identity.35This claim is not onlyinaccurate, but it is as improper as the argument that racism is an expression ofAfrikaner culture. Witchcraft beliefs are not unique to Africans. They are also encountered inpre-revolutionary Russia (Worobec 1995), in India (Bailey 1997), France(Favret-Saada 1980), and in tales of satanic child abuse in the United Statesand in England (Comaroff 1994, 1997; La Fontaine 1998). In South Africa thetokkelosiehas on occasions been described as Afrikaner folklore (Coetzee 1938:59), while fears of satanism and consultations of ‘witch-doctors’ are commonpresent-day concerns among whites (Chidester 1992: 60–66; MacCullum 1993).Indeed, after I participated in a discussion about witchcraft on the televisionprogramme Two WaysI received several telephone calls from distressed whiteresidents of Johannesburg’s affluent suburbs who earnestly believed that theyhad been the victims of witchcraft. As evidence the callers referred to consistentillness and misfortune, herbal substances they uncovered in their sitting rooms,and inexplicable cracks in their swimming pools. In December 1999, LavienaHuman, an Afrikaner woman from Louis Trichardt in the Northern Province,pleaded guilty in court to attempted murder after she paid a fellow Africanemployee R7,000 to get a concoction from a herbalist to kill her husband. Herhusband, Jasper Human, became violently ill after she sprinkled the smellymixture in his food, but he survived.36Neither is the belief in witchcraft primordial. In the lowveld, these beliefshave been marked by radical changes through time. During the earlier period ofsubsistence agriculture witchcraft accusations were inhibited by the vital import-ance of solidarity between the members of metse(extended households) andtheir neighbours. By attributing misfortune to ancestral displeasure or states ofpollution, people shifted the burden of blame onto forces that were less disruptiveof interpersonal relations. With villagization, the fragmentation of metseintosmaller households, and increased labour migration, these inhibitions disappeared.Conflict between kin and neighbours and new forms of inequality favoured morepersonalized theories of misfortune causation. At the same time the emergenceof a this-worldly and dualistic Christian worldview led to the formulation ofwitchcraft as the most concrete manifestation of evil (Niehaus 1997). Witchcraft in the new South Africa 199"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"While witchcraft may not be a discourse about modernity per se(Englund1996), it can none the less only be understood within the frame of contemp-orary social and political concerns. As I have argued elsewhere, the symbolicmeanings of witch-familiars, such as the ape-like tokolots ̆iand the snake-likemamlamboare intimately related to a people’s participation in the moderncapitalist economy as migrant labourers (Niehaus 1995). Fears of the tokolots ̆i–which is used by single adults to rape those whom they desire sexually – arose inthe context of an economic system which obliges wage-earning men to liveapart from their spouses for the greatest part of their working lives. The belief inthe mamlambo– which brings wealth, but demands human sacrifices in return –reflects upon the deprivations and the all-consuming desire for money which arekeynotes of the monetary economy. Stories of the occult also refer to witcheswho keep white persons as familiars, and use dangerous technologies describedas sekgowa(‘ways of the whites’). These include chemical poisons, trains,automobiles, and even remote-controlled devices. This symbolic associationbetween witches and whites contains important elements of a critique of whitedomination (Niehaus 1997: 123–159). Witchcraft accusations arise from con-temporary predicaments in South Africa’s rural areas such as the frailty ofmarriage; tensions about the diffusion of migrant wages; conflict overinheritance; competition for residential stands; rivalries among businessmen andchurch leaders; and enmities between richer and poorer neighbours. Witch-hunting occurred alongside other campaigns of the Comrades in their strugglesfor national liberation. Finally, colonial and postcolonial representations alike construct witchcraftas a bounded total system, torn loose from any social context.37This vision doesnot capture the fluid manner in which villagers situationally invoke witchcraftbeliefs as they encounter perplexing events – such as the appearance of snakesin their homes – experience prolonged conflict in marriage, or suffer unspeakablemisfortune – such as the untimely deaths of close kin. For villagers witchcrafthas less to do with civilization and African identity than with their experiencesof misery, abjection, illness, poverty, and insecurity in South Africa’s over-crowded former Bantustan areas (Ashforth, Chapter 10). Similarly, as Ashforth(1996, 1998, 2000) shows, the resurgence of witchcraft in the black urban areaof Soweto indicates increased inequality and the frustrations of ‘revolutionaryexpectations’ in the post-apartheid era, rather than retribalization.In these contexts, the law may well be more of an irrelevance than a decisiveinfluence. It is unlikely that either the existing Suppression of Witchcraft Act orthe proposed Witchcraft Control Act would stem witchcraft accusations. Thebest option for the state may well be a minimalist one: to allow local levelprocesses that limit violence against witches to proceed, to repeal all legislationrelated to witchcraft, and to charge those who perpetrate violence againstwitches under existing laws which deal with assault and murder. There can beno lasting solution to witchcraft-related violence if the predicaments, fears, andanxieties of the believers are not addressed.200 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Notes1 An earlier version of this paper was published in African Legal Studies(2), 2001.

These are obviouslyvast underestimates. According to police sources more than 73 people were killed aswitches in Lebowa alone in 1993 (New York Times,18 September 1994).3Sunday Times,20 April 1986.4 I have tried to emulate Ferguson (1990) who, in his study of development initiativesin Lesotho, focuses on discourses, their politics, and their real intended and unin-tended social effects.5 The Ralushai Commission was also required to investigate ritual murders. Yet theentire report refers to only eight criminal cases pertaining to ritual murders (pp.257–267), and makes no recommendations about this phenomenon. This is becausethe Commission chose to emphasize witchcraft. In the Northern Province ritualmurder is a topic of considerable importance.6 My research was conducted primarily in Green Valley, a village in the Setlharechiefdom of Bushbuckridge with an estimated population of about twenty thousandNorthern Sotho and Tsonga-speaking residents. 7 For the parliamentary discussions of on the Suppression of Witchcraft Act seeDebates of the House of Assembly (Hansard), 18 January to 22 June, 1957, pp.243–268, 328–330. 8 In the ordeal, chiefs administered poison to alleged witches. Those who died wereallegedly guilty, while the survivors were absolved of blame. See Evans-Pritchard1937, Douglas 1963, and Mombeshora 1994. 9 See Ode Brown 1935, Malinowski 1961: 94–99, Fields 1982: 577, and Mombeshora1994: 75 for more extensive overviews of British colonial witchcraft laws.10 The earliest witchcraft laws in South Africa were: Act 24 of 1886 and Act 2 of 1895(Cape of Good Hope); Law 19 (Natal); Proclamation 11 of 1887 (Zululand); andOrdinance 26 of 1904 (Transvaal). No witchcraft laws existed in the Orange FreeState. The Suppression of Witchcraft Act retained the essential clauses of the earlierlaws, but provided for the imposition of harsher penalties (previously penaltiesranged from £2 or fourteen days’ to £10 or three months’ imprisonment). 11 Fields (1982: 574) argues that missions could not provide the solution required byAfrican strategists. Missions produced African advocates for the empire, but also anacculturated elite who opposed colonialism. Moreover, converts were set aside fromthe moral community of the masses.12 See the speeches in parliament by Dr D.L. Smit, Mr Stanford, Mr Mitchell, MrSutter, and Mr Hughes. Debates of the House of Assembly (Hansard), 18 January to 22June, 1957, pp. 246–266.13 Frank Melland, a District Officer in Northern Rhodesia, adopted a sensitive stancetowards witchcraft beliefs and produced an amateur ethnographer’s treatise, arguingfor the coherence of witch beliefs, nearly fifteen years prior to Evans-Pritchard’s(1937) Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande. Melland (1923, 1935)criticized the colonial witchcraft laws as ‘politically foolish’ and pointed to flaws suchas the lumping together of ‘witches’ and ‘witch-doctors’.Witchcraft in the new South Africa 201"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"14 This case was brought to the attention of parliament by Dr D.L Smit, speaker of theUnited Party.

Mbombela, 1933 (cited in Motshekga 1984: 10). 24 In the light of the earlier discussion we can only conclude that Motshekga’s (1984)critique is somewhat misplaced. The cases he cites may be representative of thelegislative ideals, but not of actual legal practice.25 Chavunduka (1982: 18) claims that divination, the boiling water test, and thepoison ordeal are unsatisfactory methods for detecting witches that could lead to thepunishment of innocent individuals.26 Familiars listed by the report are the owl, bat, muswoo, cat, hyena, crocodile, snake,goat, jackal, duiker, donkey, tortoise, scorpion, pig, dog, leopard, tokoloti, monkey,and baboon. Articles used in witchcraft are purported to be razor blades, mirrors,sticks, brushes, pot lids, plates, horns, ball pens, gramophone records, books, mirrors,loaves of bread, and spoons (Ralushai et al1996: 22). A curious omission is themamlambo.27 See Comaroff and Comaroff (forthcoming) for a discussion and analysis of the beliefsin zombies in South Africa.28 In terms of the proposed legislation ‘Minister’ means the Minister of Health or suchother Minister to whom the Provincial Premier may from time to time assign theadministration of the Act (Ralushai et al.1996: 66). 29 Cattle were widely recognized as a form of compensation for the loss of human life.This was apparent in the case of bride wealth – where cattle were exchanged forwives – and also in homicide – where murderers compensated the families of theirvictims with ten head of cattle. The resolution of blood feuds amongst the Nuerfollowed a similar logic.30 Comaroff and Comaroff (1999) argue precisely the opposite. They suggest that‘appeals to enchantment’ have intensified in the South African ‘postcolony’. Theroots to such appeals can be found in a mixture of hope and hopelessness, and ofpromise and its perversions. In the postcolonial situation glimpses of vast wealth areaccompanied by a chilling desperation of being left out of the promise of prosperity.Comaroff and Comaroff see moral panics as symptoms of an occult economy – the202 Isak Niehaus"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"deployment of magical means for material ends. This view has considerable merit,despite the overt economism of their claims.31 These actions can be interpreted as symbolic killing. Lowvelders consider the back ofthe neck as the body’s most vulnerable part. This is where oxen are stabbed whenslaughtered. The haircut is an essential part of funeral rites. Relatives of the deceasedshave the corpse’s hair and place it in the coffin. Moreover, corpses are buried nakedand are wrapped only in white linen. By painting the witches in black oil, the witch-diviner tainted them with the colour of death and decay.32 See Niehaus 1993 for a more extensive discussion of the Green Valley witch-hunt.33 Fisiy and Geschiere (1990: 149) contend that, despite the totalitarian pretensions ofCameroon’s Ahidjo regime, there was no concerted effort by government againstwitchcraft. This practice was triggered by accusations from within villages, and courtsintervened at the request of local elites and the nkong.34 See Lan (1987: 207–222) for a brief, but informative discussion of the effects of thebureaucratization of spirit-mediums in postcolonial Zimbabwe.35 This contrasts with the manner in which witchcraft beliefs are appropriatedelsewhere.

And you cannever know what’s inside someone’s heart. You can think you knowsomebody, but you don’t. And people who have this spirit of hatred, thisbitterness, they can do anything.(Ashforth 2000: 74)1The presumption that the people amongst whom one lives have capacities forextraordinary action in the form of witchcraft creates an epistemological doublebind. On the one hand, one can never really know who has the motive formalicious action. The ‘bitterness’ in the heart, to adopt MaMfete’s terms, issecret. On the other hand, one can never really know what they are capable of,nor can one know how they achieve their evil ends for their methods and meansare secret. All one can be sure of is that if people have the motive, they can andwill act. Amidst the poverty, violence, and general hardship of life in Soweto, there isno shortage of plausible evidence that evil powers are at work. And despite thefact that the secrecy of witchcraft precludes certainty, when witches areexperienced as posing a real and present danger their potential for causing harmmakes discovering what they are up to imperative. In this chapter I intend totease out some of the implications of this double bind through a rudimentarysociology of knowledge focusing on problems of spiritual insecurity in Soweto.‘Witchcraft’, as most people with whom I have discussed the matter in Sowetoseem to understand it, is a term loosely applied to the field of illegitimate actionengaging capacities of human persons to cause harm or accumulate wealth andpower by mysterious means. In common Sowetan usage, the term – whetherexpressed in English, or its Sotho (boloi) or Zulu (ubuthakathi) equivalents –Chapter 10On living in a world with witchesEveryday epistemology and spiritual insecurityin a modern African city (Soweto)Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"refers to practices wherein human action directed towards evil ends engageswith invisible forces that are variously conceived of as either physical, human,or extra-human (spiritual) in nature.2Amongst other things, ‘witchcraft’ canrefer to the malicious manipulation of the powers of herbs and other substancesgenerally referred to as muthi(the same word as used for healing medicines), topacts with devils and demons, to innate supernatural powers, or to collectiveaction by persons engaging all of these forces. When people speak of witches atwork, they typically say people are ‘using muthi’ although they may haveradically different understandings of the active power of muthias anchored ineither chemistry, magic, or demonic powers.3Many uses of occult power and interactions with invisible forces or entitiesare considered legitimate in Soweto, most notably in prayer, divination, andhealing. Sometimes, too, suffering can be inflicted upon people by invisiblepowers as a form of legitimate punishment. Ancestors, for example, are thoughtto impose hardships on the living to remind them to pay respect to the dead(Kiernan 1982). Spirits can take possession of a person as a way of calling themto become healers (Campbell 1998).4When something is described aswitchcraft, however, the import of the statement is that a human interactionwith unseen forces has taken place which is unambiguously evil and directedtowards causing serious harm to others. The misfortunes that witches can cause are unbounded: illness, death,unemployment, car accidents, divorce, family discord are all within theircapacities. Ultimately, witches aim at death and destruction, and it is this thatdistinguishes their action from the salutary punishments of tutelary powers andrenders witchcraft essentially illegitimate (cf. Berglund 1976: 269). The distin-guishing feature of ‘witchcraft’ as a means of accumulating wealth or power (asdistinct from commonplace and legitimate occult procedures geared towards thesame end) is the killing of others.5Knowing when to ascribe an unfortunateevent to witchcraft, however, is no easy task. Typically, the action of a witch issurmised in retrospect after the onset of illness or affliction and confirmed by thediagnosis of a diviner. Even in the absence of marked misfortune, however,everyday life is lived with a lively sense of the potential of others to cause harmthrough witchcraft and a general awareness that this must be guarded against,both by being careful not to stimulate the motive of ‘jealousy’ and by securingsupernatural protection from healers.Sowetans generally are aware that there were, and perhaps still are, a greatmany ‘traditions’, in what they refer to as ‘culture’, about the powers and dangersof witches and other matters of life and death, particularly concerning relationswith ancestors, dangers of spiritual pollution, and customary prohibitions. Mostof the particularities of these traditions, however, have been long neglected.6The majority of the population (84.1 per cent) are under 40 (Morris 1999: 2.2)and few have grown up in families where the traditions of the ancestors werewell known and rigidly adhered to. In any event, tradition is not somethingundisputed. A great variety of Christians – European and African, Catholic andEpistemology and spiritual Soweto 207"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Protestant, Black, White, and Brazilian – have for more than a century beenpreaching such a variety of theological responses to indigenous cosmologies andreligious practices that no-one can say, without fear of contradiction, what is, oronce was, authentically ‘African’ (see Niehaus, Chapter 9). Furthermore, almosteveryone in Soweto has some formal schooling, with at least an introduction toelementary science. Everyone lives amidst the technologies of the modernworld. Consequently, the variety of opinions about witchcraft is every bit asdiverse as the variety of religious beliefs about a personal god that responds tohuman prayer. And while most people do not have access to sophisticated andfully elaborated cosmologies which they could present to inquisitive outsidersfully formed, they are generally mindful of the fact that they live in the worldwith witches. Sometimes they discover that this fact needs to be taken veryseriously. If all this were not enough to complicate the enterprise of interpretingrelations within these domains of power and their attendant feelings ofinsecurity, speculation about the powers of invisible forces in post-apartheidSoweto also takes place within a context marked by a stark socio-economicdifferentiation between ‘Blacks’ and ‘Whites’ that makes difficult the articu-lation of cultural differences without presuming, or confirming, historicallyiniquitous presumptions of African inferiority. My concern in this chapter is to examine, through reflection on fieldworkconducted during the 1990s in Soweto, problems of spiritual insecurity, thatsense of danger, doubt, and fear arising from troubled efforts to manage relationswith invisible forces deemed responsible for misfortune. I will suggest that theepistemological dimensions of the problem of spiritual insecurity complicate lifeand heighten the sense of vulnerability and exposure to unmanageable powers.Before attempting this, however, I will sketch a few broad historical andsociological features of life in Soweto, focusing particularly upon those aspects oflife that might be thought conducive to a general sense of insecurity.SowetoSoweto is a conglomeration of dormitory townships to the southwest ofJohannesburg (Pirie 1984b). Home to above a million people, Soweto covers anarea of about 30 square miles. In apartheid South Africa, Soweto was thebiggest, most ethnically and socio-economically diverse and the most politicallysignificant of the black townships. As Walter Sisulu, veteran leader of theAfrican National Congress and lifetime Sowetan, says (with characteristicSowetan exaggeration): ‘the history of Soweto is the history of South Africa’(Sisulu 1998: 7). Though created by government officials responding, in athoroughly modern style, to the imperatives of African urbanization by buildingracially segregated public housing for poorly paid black workers, Soweto cameover the years to resemble something living in shape and character and, despiteits inauspicious beginnings, Soweto became a place of homes. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, most Sowetans are either at schoolor are unemployed. Almost everyone between the ages of 7 and 20, about a208 Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"quarter of the total population, is at school (Morris 1999: 2.2), and many of theyounger children are in pre-schools and crèches. About two-thirds of the adultpopulation have spent ten years or more in school, although fewer than half ofthose who sat for their final matriculation examinations during the 1990s passed(South Africa Ministry of Education 1999). Although older women are likely tohave had less schooling than men, by the 1990s girls were attending school inequal numbers to boys and were more likely to sit for their matriculationexaminations (although less likely to pass). The quality of Soweto’s schools isgenerally poor.Most Sowetans are poor. About 60 per cent of households surveyed in 1997had incomes less than R1,500 ($300) per month (Morris 1999: 9), the averagewage for an urban semi-skilled worker in formal employment. In 1997, theestimated subsistence level for a family of five was R1,293 ($465) (Morris 1999:9): a loaf of bread cost about R2.50, a bottle of beer R3.5, a medium sizedtelevision R3,000, and a second-hand car R40–50,000. While many slepthungry, virtually no-one was starving, and virtually everyone had access to atelevision – either at home, in a friend’s or neighbour’s house, or in their localshebeen – that was constantly bombarding them with images reminding themthat they were not prospering despite the election of a government promising ‘ABetter Life for All’. In relation to the socio-economic profile of South Africa as a whole, Sowetois somewhere in the middle. There are many places where conditions are farworse. Black people in rural areas for example have much lower householdincomes (less than R1,000 per year [Whiteford and Van Seventer 1999]) and farinferior access to services. Indeed, Soweto has a slightly higher socio-economicprofile with a more substantial middle class than most other black townships(Morris 1999: 11). In comparison with the formerly segregated (and still mostlywhite) suburbs, however, conditions in Soweto – even in the relatively desirableparts – are inferior. For the past decade the black middle classes have been fleeing Soweto forhouses in the suburbs and new housing developments outside the townships.Over the same period, socio-economic inequalities among black South Africanshave increased to match the aggregate income difference between black andwhite (Whiteford and Van Seventer 1999). Most families have at least somerelatives who are prospering, but it would be very difficult to find a financiallysuccessful person in or from Soweto who has no relatives that are poor. Theimpact of this growing black income inequality has been felt in virtually everyfamily. All of the families I have been close to over the past decade have beenwracked in the last few years by conflicts over money and resentments about theredistribution of resources to less-well-off relatives.Most ‘breadwinners’ in Sowetan households are male (67.4 per cent [Morris1999]), and the ideology of family life is strongly patriarchal, with fathersclaiming the right to govern women and children absolutely. In practice,however, mothers dominate family life. Given the scarcity of cash in this placeEpistemology and spiritual Soweto 209"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"and the absence of other resources upon which to found their manhood, such asland or cattle, it is extremely difficult for most males, especially young men, tolive up to the predominating ideals of masculinity grounded upon the capacityto support and dominate women and children (Ashforth 1999). Older women,particularly, are inclined to view men in general as being ‘useless’. I once askedthe women in the house where I stay their opinion of the fathers in the 30houses lining our street. Only three of the 30 families had fathers who were stillin residence with their families and not adjudged ‘useless’. Poverty is particularlyhard on the status of fatherhood. When children sleep hungry, though theirmother suffers with them, she is no less a mother for their pain. In fact, sharingthe suffering of her family makes her more of a mother in the eyes of thecommunity. A father whose family suffers, however, is by definition a failure. Forit is a father’s duty to provide. Not surprisingly, many men flee the constantreminders of their failings. Paternal flight also makes more difficult the respons-ibility of maintaining relations with the father’s ancestors, who are the principlesource of welfare for the family.Most Sowetan breadwinners view themselves as ‘urban’ people (Morris 1999:4.11). Because the years of ‘high’ apartheid, during the 1950s to the 1980s, weremarked by ever-increasing efforts by the authorities to control the movement ofpeople to towns, and the fact that public housing construction in Sowetoessentially stopped after the late 1960s, most of the older sections of Soweto arepopulated by families whose youngest members are the descendants of severalgenerations of urban dwellers. The children in the house where I stay, forexample, are fourth generation Sowetans whose great grandparents came toJohannesburg in the 1930s and whose grandparents settled in the street when itwas built in 1964. The history of a family’s migration to the urban areas hasenormous significance for the character of life within a household. More recentmigrants are more likely to live in poorer neighbourhoods, with lower qualityhousing (Morris 1999: 9.10), and they are more likely also to have strongerknowledge of and attachments to rituals and traditions of rural life. Native-bornSowetans tend to view their country cousins with disdain, although they aremindful of the rural basis of what people refer to as ‘culture’ and the attendantreputation of distant parts for powerful witchcraft and healing.In 1954, the national government decreed that henceforth all townshiphousing should be segregated along ethnic lines (Pirie 1984a). About two-thirdsof the townships of Greater Soweto are thus segregated, divided broadly intothose dominated by Zulu- and Xhosa-speaking households, and those wherePedi, Sotho, and Tswana predominate. One township, Chiawelo, was set asidefor Tsonga- and Venda-speaking families. The oldest townships, such as Orlandoand Pimville, were not ethnically segregated and neither were the newer suburbsbuilt since the 1970s. Broad linguistic divisions remain throughout Soweto.From childhood, however, most Sowetans learn at least some variety of both themain African language groups of the region (Sotho/Tswana and Nguni) as wellas English. Most younger people, in their daily encounters, speak a distinct210 Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"urban argot known as iscamthowhich is all but incomprehensible to speakers of‘pure’ versions of the regional languages (Ntshangase 1993). Just as their languageborrows from diverse sources to create something new and constantly changing,so do the concepts expressed therein, including that of ‘witchcraft’.Virtually all Sowetans are at least nominally Christian. Like black SouthAfricans more generally, approximately one-third of Sowetans affiliate them-selves with particular ‘Mainline’ (European mission) congregations and anotherthird with ‘Independent’ (or ‘African Initiated’) congregations (Froise 1996:21).7The vast majority of regular churchgoers are women and girls. As well asbeing Christians, however, and in many instances despite the formal teachingsof their church, most Sowetans also participate in at least some rituals associatedwith indigenous practices of ancestor reverence and most will also consult a‘traditional healer’ when the need arises. The commonly cited figure forconsultation with a traditional healer countrywide is 80 per cent of black SouthAfricans (Select Committee on Social Services 1998). My experience in Sowetowould confirm at least this rate. I would also estimate that the number of suchhealers in Soweto is approximately 10,000. In addition, a similar number ofIndependent church ‘prophets’ are probably active in healing work in Soweto.There are two hospitals (one public and one private), 12 public clinics offeringlow-cost medical services, one private clinic, and about 30 or 40 private medicalpractices. Treatment at public clinics is much cheaper than treatment by‘traditional healers’. Healer-prophets of the African Initiated Churches tend notto charge as much as traditional healers, although participation in theirchurches can involve major investments of time and life-style change. In 1997,most people (76.7 per cent) reported themselves as in good health, although asignificant proportion (13.4 per cent) said their health had been ‘bad’ in thepast month (Morris 1999). Of women over the age of 50, 29.5 per cent reportedtheir health as bad (compared with 20 per cent of men) and 14.4 per cent ofolder people suffered from hypertension (Morris 1999). In 1998, 20 per cent of pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics testedpositive for HIV-1. At the end of 2000 the seroprevalence rate for HIV amongstpregnant women countrywide was 24.5 per cent (Department of Health 2001).When I first began talking to people in Soweto about AIDS in the early 1990s,the disease was laughingly referred to as the ‘American Invention to DiscourageSex’ and the government’s programme to dispense free condoms through clinicswas seen as a ploy to keep the black birth-rate down in the interests of whitesupremacy. By the end of the 1990s, however, death from AIDS was beginningto become commonplace in Soweto although there was a strong stigma againstacknowledging the disease as the cause of death. South Africa at the turn of thecentury is estimated to have the fastest growing rate of HIV infection and allindications are that the death rate from AIDS will increase dramatically in thenext decade (Whiteside and Sunter 2000). Few people know their HIV status,and when symptoms of illnesses associated with AIDS begin, many peopleidentify them as witchcraft-associated (Ashforth 2001). Epistemology and spiritual Soweto 211"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Soweto is a dangerous place. Each year more than 1,000 people are murderedthere, with another 15,000 attempted murders. Until 1994, political murdersand repressive state violence were also a major concern.8Approximately 13,000violent assaults, 2,500 or more rapes,9and more than 4,000 burglaries ofresidential properties are reported annually (South African Police Service1998). Sowetans have always been worried about crime and have always takenprecautions in everyday life to secure themselves against criminals. All houseshave bars on their windows; most have at least barbed wire fences and lockedgates. Approximately one in three households is affected by serious crime eachyear, and slightly more than one in ten is affected by violent crimes.10Morethan two-thirds of respondents surveyed in 1997 thought that crime had increasedin the previous five years. And the crimes that most people were most worriedabout were rape (34.1 per cent of respondents placed it at the top of their list ofworries) and murder (26.4 per cent) (Morris 1999: 7.2). There are 12 policestations in Soweto. The officers working in them are struggling against not onlythe legacy of their reputation as enforcers of apartheid, but the legacy of thegeneralized disregard for lawfulness that system instilled, not to mention thetemptations of bribery and the deep-seated incompetence of a poorly managedand ill-prepared force. Victims of crime in Soweto rarely turn to the lawenforcement system with any real expectation of receiving justice.On top of all the dangers of crime, the streets of Soweto are part of a networkof roads throughout South Africa that have one of the world’s highest rates ofdeath per vehicle mile travelled (Ministry of Transport 1997). Some 10,000people die on South African roads annually, with between 35,000 and 40,000suffering serious injuries. Approximately twice that number suffer minor injuries(Ministry of Transport 1997). I have no specific figures for Soweto, but haveseen enough carnage on the roads there to suspect that the Sowetan rates ofroad death and injury are commensurate with those of the rest of the country. Alcohol abuse contributes significantly to the mayhem on the roads, as itdoes to the general scourge of violence in homes and neighbourhoods (Parryand Bennetts 1999). Researchers report that South Africans are amongst theheaviest drinkers in the world and that some 30 per cent of urban Africans areat risk from alcohol abuse (Parry 1997). My experience in Sowetan shebeens –those unlicensed drinking houses, one of which can be found within about 100yards of any given point in the township – certainly confirms this finding.Surveys of criminal suspects and crime victims show a strong correlation betweenalcohol consumption and violent crime, with one reporting more than 70 percent of victims and suspects in assault cases under the influence of alcohol(Shaw and Gastrow 2001). Serious drug abuse most often takes the form ofMandrax (methalqualone, a.k.a ‘quaaludes’) tablets, a heavy tranquillizer which,when smoked with marijuana (a combination favoured by young men and boysin Soweto), produces hallucinations and is addictive.11To avoid unnecessaryinjury in Soweto, the first thing to do is to avoid places where young men aredrinking.212 Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Considerations of security intrude into virtually every aspect of ordinary lifein Soweto although they are not reckoned in the same way by everyone (youngwomen, for example, factor the possibility of rape into their every move; youngmen calculate the risks of assault). Woven into the fabric of social life, partic-ularly through the responsibilities of kinship, is the fundamental requirement ofmutual aid and protection. For young men, particularly, ‘brotherhood’ means awillingness to risk your own life for that of your friends. On the streets ofSoweto, young men are rarely far from situations where that commitment mightbe tested. Few people feel secure walking the streets at night. As well as living behind well-secured gates and doors, most Sowetans andtheir houses have, at some time or another, been protected against the threat ofwitchcraft through, amongst other things, the application of herbs to incisionsin the skin at joints (an operation known in Zulu as ukuqiniswa), the protectionof a house from assaults by witches and evil spirits by means of healers spreadingherbal mixtures around the property, or the presentation by healer-prophets ofthe African Initiated Churches of coloured cords to wear around the waist andwater that has been prayed over (cf. Ashforth 2000). In sum, then, Soweto is a working-class city where life is tough but notimpossible. Generally, people are poor but most live in a solid house and haveaccess to drinkable water and electricity. Most households also have a phone, ora family member with a cell phone; all have access to public phones in the nearvicinity. With some 60 per cent of households earning barely sufficient to meetsubsistence, most people live a financially precarious existence often made worseby addiction to alcohol. Many Sowetans, however, are thriving. Those who arenot financially strapped have relatives whom they are expected to assistfinancially, far too many such relatives to help them all. And every familyis intimately acquainted with a victim of disease, assault, fatal violence, androad death. Of all the families I have known since 1990, I know not a single onethat has survived the decade without someone in the not-too-extended familydying of a preventable illness, in a crime of violence, or on the roads. I knownone who can unambiguously proclaim themselves to be well off and free fromsuffering.Spiritual insecurity and the struggle for lifeThe existence of something we might call spiritual insecurity is not easy todemonstrate. When people build walls braided with razor-wire around theirhouses, as they do in Soweto, it is easy to conclude that they do so to enhancetheir feeling of security. When they attend a church or visit a traditional healer,can we conclude they suffer from spiritual insecurity? Obviously not. Thevariety of motives and meanings in religious and spiritual experience cannot bereduced to questions of ‘security’ without injustice to the richness and complexityof life. Yet, on those occasions when life is experienced as subject to maliciousforces bent on causing harm and misfortune, forces to be dreaded and fought,Epistemology and spiritual Soweto 213"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"then questions of security do come to the fore amongst other consolations ofreligious life. However, the fact that the crowded field of healing in both the ‘traditional’and ‘prophetic’ faith-healing domains encompasses activities directly related toproviding security from forces deemed bent on causing harm indicates that thematter of spiritual insecurity in Soweto is not insignificant. Moreover, whileindividual healers vigorously assert the legitimacy and integrity of their healingpractice, in the popular imagination a person who knows how to manipulate thepowers of herbs and others substances to heal is also, potentially, one capable ofusing that knowledge to evil ends.12Most of the time, however, questions of spiritual insecurity in Soweto are notpredominant. Unless being interviewed for some research project or debatingthe plausibility of some story doing the rounds, people mostly talk about witch-craft for amusement and all the malicious pleasures of scurrilous gossip (vanDijk, Chapter 5; Ashforth 2000: ch. 11). On occasion, however, the laughterand philosophical speculation disappears and witchcraft, or some other matterinvolving the action of mysterious powers, becomes a matter of life and death.These moments may be rare, but for the social researcher they are extremelyproblematic, particularly in relation to the misfortunes suspected as derivingfrom ‘witchcraft’. For the moments when witchcraft is most significant in people’slives is also the time when it is least discussed. Moments, such as the birth of achild, when families are most vulnerable to occult assault, are treated with greatconfidentiality. Indeed, to talk openly at such times is to court catastrophe. Forif word gets out that you are vulnerable, your enemies will make their move. If awitch knows that you have been attacked, the witch can easily switch to a newstrategy of attack. And if others know you are already vulnerable, they may addtheir own curses to your burden. While living in Soweto I have witnessed many occasions when dread ofunseen powers has come to dominate friends’ lives, causing them to expendprecious emotional energy and money combating evil powers. For example,Mama C once met an inyangain her neighbour’s kitchen. When her asthmaworsened shortly thereafter she became convinced that she was bewitched.None of the healers we visited could alleviate her suffering or the stress createdby her fear of the neighbour’s sorcery, all of which contributed to her hyper-tension. Convinced that nobody comes out of a hospital alive, she resistedmedical treatment until it was too late. She died of heart failure within the year.She was 56 years old. I have also witnessed occasions when friends have beenwracked with anxiety and anger after being suspected or accused outrightof practising witchcraft. After my friend M built her mother a house, someneighbours who still lived in shacks, seemingly beside themselves with envy,accused the mother of using witchcraft to cause the death of a local family whohad died the year before in a car accident. M’s mother, shunned by her oldfriends and fuming at the injustice of the accusations, began attending churchregularly as a precaution. Experiences such as these convinced me of the214 Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"importance of examining questions of witchcraft as insecurity. And because themanagement of dangers and dread named under the rubric ‘witchcraft’ requiresthe engagement of a host of other powers and forces, from the inherent propertiesof physical substances to the miraculous powers of Jesus and the Holy Spirit, Ithink it not improper to treat witchcraft as a phenomenon in the generaldomain of spiritual insecurity. Witchcraft and motive: the presumption of maliceKenneth Burke in his famous exposition of ‘dramatism’ identified five ‘basicforms of thought . . . which are exemplified in the attribution of motive’ (Burke1969: xv). These he summarized as: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose.Burke spent an enormous amount of time demonstrating that statements abouteach of these were always invoked whenever ‘we say what people are doing andwhy they are doing it’ (Burke 1969: xv). I want to paraphrase Burke’s questionand ask: what is involved when Sowetans say people are doing witchcraft andwhy they are doing it? And I will pilfer his five key terms of ‘dramatism’ to use asa framework for identifying the key epistemological problems of everyday life ina world of witches.When Sowetans talk about acts of witchcraft, the talk typically centres onevents surrounding premature death or events that could potentially have led todeath, such as serious illnesses, accidents, or brushes with violence. While thereare many ways of dying, three predominate: illness, murder, and motor vehicleaccidents. Any occurrence of such an event is an occasion for speculation aboutwitchcraft. The character and intensity of such speculation will depend primarilyupon the relation of the interlocutors to the victims; for strangers and distantacquaintances, the tone might be one of idle speculation; for close relatives andloved ones, the matter can be so serious it might not be spoken of at all. The keyto construing a death or potential death as an act of witchcraft is the imputationof agency to a perpetrator motivated to harm the victim. This perpetrator israrely an agent in the ordinary sense. Thus, a young man might be murdered byschoolmates for reasons of their own, and the incident might thus be treated –by the police, the media, and whatever ‘public’ might exist for the narrative – asyet another story of murder and senseless violence. The same event, however,especially if it follows on the heels of other familial tragedies, may spur privatespeculation about the agency of others orchestrating the events of which theimmediate agents, the murderers, were mere unwitting puppets.The scene, or background situation within which acts of witchcraft are almostalways played out in Soweto, as elsewhere in South Africa, is the household.Indeed, witchcraft is more often than not conceived of as an assault upon afamily. The other players in the drama are all situated within intimate networksof relatives, friends, neighbours, schoolmates, church congregants, workmates,and so on. Acts of witchcraft are not usually perpetrated by strangers. Essentiallythe limiting factor in determining who is potentially part of the scene, or agentEpistemology and spiritual Soweto 215"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"in the drama, is the extent of face-to-face community bounded by possibilities ofpersonalmotives for malice. Impersonal agencies of misfortune, such as theApartheid regime, were not generally thought to be responsible for witchcraft-related suffering, although the people commanding powerful agencies can bethought to bolster their strength through sorcery.13In principle, anyone can be a witch. All that is required to be, or become, awitch is the desire to kill and the capacity or know-how to do so. The desire atthe heart of otherwise ordinary human agents that transforms them into a witch,the ‘bitterness in the heart’, is the source of the jealousy and hatred that is theirmotive for acting. And this desire is hidden. Not only is it hidden by virtue ofthe fact that one can never truly penetrate the depths of another’s being, but ifthe bitterness motivating the desire to perpetrate witchcraft is in fact present,the witch, in order to avoid counteraction or punishment of his or her evil deeds,will keep it secret. When people speak of witchcraft as inherited, as theysometimes do, the thing that is passed down through generations can be eitherthis bitterness, or the secret knowledge of muthi, or both.Given that the motive for witchcraft is secret, and considering that theperpetrators have a strong incentive to conceal their motives, one way todetermine the identity of the agent behind a particular act of witchcraft is toassess the probability of particular persons possessing the motives of jealousy andhatred. There are two basic ways of doing this: first, to assess the distribution ofjealousy across particular social roles and correlate it with access to other meansof causing harm, most notably violence; and, second, to assess the possiblemotives of particular individuals by inference from their other words and deeds.Broadly speaking, capacities for witchcraft and capacities for violence aretypically perceived to be inversely related. Young men, for example, who arethe most violent category of individuals, are seldom thought responsible forperpetrating witchcraft. Older women, on the other hand, who have few directphysical outlets for their malicious desires, or for revenge, are prime suspectswhen it comes to the covert action that is witchcraft. When asked, Sowetans speak of all social roles as if co-existing on a spectrumof possibilities between pure witchcraft and pure violence. A jealous husband,for example, is presumed more likely to beat his wife and fight her lovers withfists, knives, and guns rather than punish them with witchcraft; a wife, on theother hand, if spurned, will have fewer options for violent retaliation and istherefore presumed more likely to resort to ‘using muthi’, that is, witchcraft.While the propensity for jealousy and envy are generally presumed to be evenlydistributed across populations, certain social roles are deemed more conduciveto the emotion than others. For example, mothers are considered more likely tobe jealous of the achievements of other people’s children than fathers becausesuccess in motherhood is rated primarily in relation to their children, whilefathers are expected to build their own status as individuals. No matter how thepropensity for motives conducive to witchcraft is inferred, however, the secrecyof the act and the secrecy of the inner motive determine that there will always216 Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"be doubt regarding a witch’s identity. To penetrate this secrecy, divination isneeded. To be sure about a diviner’s knowledge, however, a confession isrequired. Given the essential secrecy with which the truth about ‘bitterness’ inthe heart is masked, the only truly reliable way of obtaining knowledge aboutthe potential for witchcraft of any particular individual is through their positiveconfession (see Bastian, Chapter 4). Denials must always be doubted, for whatelse would a true witch do but deny? Positive confessions, on the other hand,especially because they expose the person making the confession to potentiallyserious sanctions, are valuable – even if, in fact, they are false or preposterous.14Only a positive confession of the desire to do evil can suffice to pre-emptsuspicions of that desire (see Berglund 1976). The agency of witchcraft, is, of course, witchcraft. Again, the tautology ismeaningful because the act is premised on secrecy. Nobody knows how witchcraftworks, except the witch. Thus, if an event is deemed to result from witchcraft,the means of causing it can only be named and countermanded, never com-prehended. In contemporary Soweto there are certain conventional techniquesthat are imagined to comprise the witch’s craft. These include such proceduresas blowing herbs in the wind, placing them in food or drink, laying them in thepath of an intended victim, creating familiars such as the legendary tikoloshewith his enormous genitals, domesticating certain animals in the service of evil,transmitting medicines through the sex act, and so on. The conventionalrepertoire of imagined witchcraft procedures mimics to some extent thepractices of traditional healing. However, the techniques of witchcraft are byno means considered as limited to tried and tested traditions. The presumptionthese days is that witches are constantly innovating their techniques, and thatthe ‘African science’ of witchcraft is every bit as up-to-date and potent as‘White science’.15In the absence of confession, life in a world of witches must be lived on apresumption of malice and with constant vigilance. Underlying all narratives ofwitchcraft that I have encountered in Soweto is the presumption that everyoneis jealous of everyone else, regardless of appearances. Thus it is wise to presumemalice in community life, even despite appearances to the contrary. Indeed, thispresumption of malice is wise especiallydespite appearances of comity, for witcheswill bewitch simply because they can. In the event of good fortune befallingyour family, it is wise to avoid any appearance of pride such as might makeneighbours feel their feelings of envy justified them taking occult action. Insecurity and uncertaintyClearly there are ‘objective’ aspects to danger and, thus, fear and insecurity.Similarly there are purely subjective fears that may never find an objectivecorrelative and generalized anxieties that need no object to evoke paralysingfear. Although it is generally not helpful to insist upon separating objective fromsubjective perceptions of threat, it is clear that conscious endeavours towardsEpistemology and spiritual Soweto 217"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"seeking security are predicated upon interpretation of the nature of threats andrisks. The distinctive features of spiritual security arise, it seems to me, from thecharacter of the epistemological problems they generate. These consist of apentad of uncertainties – ambiguity, indeterminacy, secrecy, privacy, and mystery– produced amidst a superabundance of interpretive authority.For people who live in a world of witches, the fact that evil forces are notordinarily visible in no way diminishes the possibility of accurately discerningtheir action in shaping the fortunes and misfortunes of life (Nyamnjoh, Chapter2). Invisibility, however, does present definite problems of interpretation.Typically, revelation of the action of invisible forces involves the interpretationof visible, audible, or generally tangible and intelligible signs. But these signs arethemselves inherently ambiguous, for the sign is not the power itself. The sign isalways originated by something else, the hidden reality that lies ‘behind’ theappearance of its manifestation. An illness characterized by persistent symptomsof coughing, for example, might be the sign that ancestors are displeased. Or itmight be a sign of witchcraft at work in the form of isidliso(‘poisoning’). Itmight also be tuberculosis, which in turn might have been brought on by anunseen virus named HIV sent by a witch. On the other hand, it might just bethe result of a nasty cold causing bronchitis for which nobody is responsible andwhich a visit to the doctor might relieve. So the work of interpreting signs isplagued by indeterminacy. As no-one but the witch can know the precise means of their illicit craft, sothose who would seek to counteract this evil work must gain knowledge fromaccess to ‘higher’ powers, beings such as ancestors or the Holy Spirit who canpenetrate the secrets of the witch’s craft without compromising their own moralcharacter (and who can communicate this knowledge to human specialists inturn without compromising them). But penetrating evil secrets is dangerouswork, and not open to all. Emerging from the secrecy undergirding the per-petration of witchcraft is the problem of privacy in authorizing the procedures ofdivination so central to the struggle to contain evil. The knowledge required tocounteract the witch’s secret power or divine the intentions of ancestors or otherbeings transmitting information about the dangers lurking in unseen domains isnecessarily private, deriving from particular communication with higher beings.Both traditional healers and prophets (I will refer to them both, here, as‘diviners’) partake in aspects of this privacy by founding their authority andpower upon particular and personal relations with spiritual beings. Their healingand restorative practices are not premised upon generalizable, or even generallyverifiable, public principles or institutions. Rather, diviners work through privatecommunications with personal empowering spirits: dialogues in which only theyhave access to the interlocutor. The ‘truth’ uncovered through these conver-sations is then opened to participation and corroboration in dialogue with theclient. A communication from a diviner’s spirits will be deemed true if it accordswith a privately known fact of the supplicant’s life to which the diviner had noprevious access or if the divination reveals a future course of events which218 Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"subsequently comes to pass. While a diviner might gain a reputation for greatpower and ability in such a manner, his or her authority in counteracting evilwill always remain limited because of the personal and private nature of theessential authorizing relationships upon which that power is founded.16Matters pertaining to questions of witchcraft also intrude upon consider-ations of what might be termed a theological problem of ‘unknowing’ in relationto unseen powers. I would argue that it is necessary to countenance somethingakin to the phenomenon known in religious experience as the Mystery inrelation to these matters pertaining to unseen powers, that is an engagementwith something transcendent beyond human apprehension. This domain ofmystery ought not be confused with that which is merely secret or hidden fromview, for the idea of mystery invokes a concept of the unknowable pertaining tothose realms of being wherein lie the ‘interior’ domains of personhood variouslyknown in the west as ‘mind’, ‘spirit’, ‘soul’, and what my friend Madumodescribes as ‘the whole set-up of unseen powers’. That is to say, the putativeaction of witchcraft, along with the very real fears relating to them, spring from,relate to, and are located in, realms of being which are both ineffable and opento transcendence – that are not subject to forms of knowledge adequately repre-sented by clear and distinct ideas (Nyamnjoh, Chapter 2). ‘Witchcraft’, in itsbroadest sense, refers to ways of being that are meaningful in connection withan orientation of openness to relations with the ineffable – that unknowableand unrepresentable something that is both ‘out there’ (in the rivers, themountains, the heavens, the cosmos. . .) and ‘in here’ (in the ‘heart’, the ‘soul’,the ‘spirit’. . .) as well as, as some would have it, ‘amongst us’. It is, in a word, areligious phenomenon. This sense of metaphysical openness can also coexistwith a sense of vulnerability, such as is confirmed by the widespread presumptionsabout the powers of witches, that can result in intense anxiety relating tostruggles to manage the action of invisible forces upon the course of life.Epistemic anxiety and the struggle against beliefThere is no such thing as a simple ‘belief ’ in witchcraft in twenty-first centurySoweto. With most people I know well, the recognition of the reality ofwitchcraft is coupled with a belief that, somehow or other, one ought not tobelieve in witches. For example, a neighbour says she ‘partly’ believes inwitchcraft: ‘Witchcraft. . . it partly exists. That’s true. But me, I don’t believe’.That is to say, she does believe, but would rather not. Yet she is alert to thedangers that can emanate from invisible domains. So when her house was hit bylightning, she was quick to seek protection from a local prophet. My neighbour’sattitude to these matters is by no means unusual.This second order ‘belief ’ (if it can be called that) regarding the undesir-ability of believing in witches has a very complex structure, impinging uponpeople’s attitudes to occult forces in a multitude of ways. In some instances, ittakes the form of a secular modernist assertion of the primacy of science. A visitEpistemology and spiritual Soweto 219"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"to the clinic that leads to a clear medical diagnosis coupled with swift andeffective treatment, for example, can trump suspicions of witchcraft. Similarly, afaith in chemistry can help alleviate the anxiety that might otherwise followrecognition of signs of sorcery in action, such as the time when my friend MC,in the middle of a battle with an aunt for possession of the family home, foundwhite powder sprinkled on the kitchen floor in a suspicious manner. Althoughrecognizing that the situation was dangerous, he told himself that he wasimmune to such nonsense, and, after a few drinks to bolster his courage,impressed his friends by dancing over the powder. Some resist the pull of witchcraft beliefs by embracing a ‘mainline’ Christianinsistence on the power and love of Jesus, while nurturing their faith in thepower of Jesus to triumph over the forces of evil such as might be evidenced inthe form of witchcraft.17Evangelical and Pentecostalist congregations, alongwith the huge variety of African Initiated Christian churches, tend to engagewith the struggle against Satan and witches more explicitly and, hence, theiradherents seem to have less concern with denying the belief in witchcraft thanwith combating the dangers it presents (van Dijk, Chapter 5).Sometimes, a deliberate reluctance to ‘believe’ in witches is seen as a practicalway of avoiding the psychological snares that await anyone seeking signs ofoccult forces at work. When we once found a substance resembling mud smearedon the wall in front of the house in Soweto, everyone made a conscious decisionto resist the temptation to think that it contained muthi, preferring to think ofthe act as vandalism rather than witchcraft. If, however, the discovery of themud had been accompanied by some serious mishap in the house, it might nothave been easy to discount the possibility of occult attack. Another reason for resisting the pull of witchcraft explanations for misfortunesis the belief that witches themselves can use your own mind to act against you.A person who becomes obsessed with questions of witchcraft might be layingthemselves open to attack by weakening their mental defences against occultaction. Thus my friend Madumo was instructed that ‘westernizing’ his mindcould help in reducing the actual power of real witches seeking to destroy him.Ignoring the witches in this view does not make them disappear into that realmof nothingness we call the ‘imagination’, as a good westerner might believe, butmerely renders them less effective. Living in a world of witches in a place likeSoweto at the turn of the century, then, almost always involves a struggle againstbelieving in witches despite the plenitude of evidence of suffering. Duringordinary times, when the forces of misfortune seem manageable, the ‘akrasia’(incontinence of the will) regarding beliefs about witches, the failure of the willto refuse belief, is of little import.18When calamity strikes, however, the strugglecan become all-consuming. When I have witnessed friends in Soweto faced with problems of spiritualinsecurity, when they have battled with a pressing need to manage the forcesconsidered responsible for their suffering or those shaping their destinies andfate in detrimental ways, the plethora of available interpretative schemes often220 Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"resulted in heightened anxiety about the nature and character of those powers.Given the widespread extent and uneven distribution of material hardship andviolence in Soweto, it is not difficult to understand how the effort to findmeaning in misfortune and to make suffering bearable (Geertz 1973) mightreadily lead to suppositions about witchcraft, even amongst people who mightbe inclined to scepticism. In the eyes of those predisposed to detect such signs, evidence of maliciouspowers at work is everywhere. Indeed, were one so inclined as to perpetratewitchcraft oneself, the probability of misfortune befalling the intended victimsor their loved-ones within a few months is sufficiently high to lend credence toconjectures of supernatural causation, whatever the actual efficacy of one’switchly efforts. None of the families I was intimately connected with throughoutthe 1990s survived the decade without experiencing serious problems they couldnot help but associate with witchcraft. But were their worries about witchcraftmerely a product of living in an insecure world?I believe that if people in Soweto could live lives free of worries about money,illness, and early death they would be less concerned about other people beingable to afflict them through witchcraft. Poverty and material insecurity makepeople feel more exposed to risks they are unable to manage, in ways that arenot only conducive to fearful speculations about supernatural powers, but whichalso exact a more mundane toll of depression and hopelessness. I also suspectthat if greater material security prevailed, the rituals, prayers, ceremonies, andhealing procedures that in times of crisis can become life-and-death strugglesagainst evil forces might perhaps serve more as markers of a renascent Africanidentity or joyful celebrations of community. Were everyone healthy, safe fromviolence, and financially secure, concerns about witchcraft might even come tobe subsumed under categories of individual ‘psychological’ disturbance. Such days, however, are not on the horizon. In the meantime, in addition toworrying about the ordinary woes of a hard life, people in Soweto must alsograpple with distinct problems of spiritual insecurity, particularly the fear thatothers – who, despite all appearances to the contrary – might be harbouring evilintentions. And the ways in which these problems of security are resolved, ornot resolved, through a presumption of malice can have serious ramifications inthe lives of individuals, families, and communities, and perhaps also in thedemocratic state itself.Notes1 My discussions with people in Soweto about these matters have continued since myfirst visit in 1990. During the early 1990s, I spent most of my time living in Soweto.Since 1994, I have visited for three months each year. For an account of my engage-ment with the place and a description of some of the people who have made itpossible for me to live there, see Ashforth 2000. When I speak of ‘friends’ these arethe people of whom I speak. When I speak of ‘experience’, this is where it happened. 2 Many Africans object to the terms ‘witch’, ‘witchcraft’, and ‘witchdoctor’, arguingEpistemology and spiritual Soweto 221"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"that they are derogatory and misleading. This is undoubtedly so, but the words areunavoidable. Not only are the English words common in African usage, but theindigenous terms such as the Zulu ubuthakathihave long been inflected with notionsderiving from Europe as much as Africa. Nor is it possible to insist on definitionalclarity and precision without obscuring the ways in which the words are actually usedin everyday practice. I prefer to use the terms loosely, much as my friends in Sowetodo, while teasing out from investigation of the context what they might mean. 3 The term ‘sorcery’ is unknown in everyday parlance in Soweto. It could, however, besubstituted for ‘witchcraft’ in most of what follows, since there is no firm distinctionin these parts, such as reported by Evans-Pritchard (1937: 21) in the 1930s Sudanbetween ‘witchcraft’ as an innate capacity and ‘sorcery’ as the skill of manipulatingsubstances.4 In a Christian context preoccupied by demons, spirit possession can be problematicand people undergoing the symptoms of such possession that would traditionallyhave been interpreted as a call to heal are often subject to exorcism. Oosthuizen(1992) reports that such exorcisms, often in the form of repeated baptisms, arecommonplace in African Initiated Churches. See also Jonker 1992 for discussion ofthe demonizing of ancestral spirits in Zambia.5 Killings related to these forms of ‘witchcraft’ are typically thought to take threeforms: ‘muthi-murders’ (also known as ‘ritual killings’) in which body parts are used inmedicines (Commission of Inquiry into Witchcraft Violence and Ritual Murders1996); zombie-making, in which a victim is reincarnated as a slave double (Comaroffand Comaroff 1999; Niehaus n.d.); and human sacrifices to mystical beasts such asthe snake maMlambowho is said to require the flesh of a relative (preferably one’sown child) in recompense for her grant of wealth and power (Wilson 1961). Foraccounts of muthi-murder in the 1980s and 1990s, see the Report of the RalushaiCommission on Witchcraft Violence (Commission of Inquiry into Witchcraft Violenceand Ritual Murders 1996).6 My point is not that there has been a ‘loss’ of culture. Rather, in the vibrant worlds ofurban life, there is a superabundance of interpretative authorities seeking to givemeaning to life (Mugo 1999).7 For discussion of the Independent churches in Soweto, see West 1975. On the AICmovement more generally, see Sundkler 1960 and Oosthuizen 1992.8 In the first four years of the 1990s there were some 6,361 deaths attributed topolitical violence in the region around Soweto (Bornman et al. 1998: 18). 9 The statistics on rape are notoriously unreliable. South Africa has the highestincidence of reported rape in the world (Human Rights Watch 2001). A survey ofwomen in the south of Johannesburg, the region encompassing Soweto, found that20 per cent of young women experienced sexual abuse by the age of 18 (Anderson etal. 2000).10 I arrive at this estimate by dividing the number of crimes reported in 1997 by theSAPS for Soweto (24,464 violent crimes; 67,765 including crimes against residentialproperty) (South African Police Service 1998) by the number of households(178,338 including in this number those with backyard structures) estimated by theWits Survey (Morris 1999). These are rough approximations only and probablyunderestimate the incidence of sexual and domestic violence. The ‘household’ unithere contrived gives a rough approximation of the social universe most directlyaffected by crimes. When the Wits survey asked respondents to rank the ‘problems’faced by their households, 27.7 per cent rated being a victim of crime as their biggestproblem (University of the Witwatersrand Department of Sociology 1997: 6.2.4 ). 11 A survey of drug use amongst criminal offenders found that 56 per cent of young maleoffenders under the age of 20 were using this combination (Louw and Parry 1999).222 Adam Ashforth"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"12 For an example of these sensitivities, see the account of the healer Sarah Mashele’sattitudes in Simon 1993. When arrests are made in connection with ‘ritual murder’cases involving human body parts, the stories typically refer to the involvement of‘traditional healers’. For example, see the South African Press Association report‘Ritual Murder: Healers in Court’ (SAPA 18 May 2001).13 During apartheid, there was widespread suspicion that ‘traditional authorities’ wereusing ‘muthi’ to maintain themselves in power at the people’s expense (Commissionof Inquiry into Witchcraft Violence and Ritual Murders 1996). In the late 1990s,too, I heard many rumours that the leader of the Zion Christian Church, the biggestreligious organization in the region, Bishop Lekganyane, maintained a storeroom ofhuman body parts which he drew upon to secure the success of his church. 14 For an example of a self-proclaimed African witch’s confession, see Bannerman-Richter 1984.15 Perhaps the most powerful analogy lending plausibility to the witchcraft paradigmtoday is that of western science against which is posited the equal potency of‘African science’ as practised by witches and healers. Living in a world where themiracles of remote control and mobile telephones are everyday realities and imagesof nuclear explosions or space travels commonplace, no-one doubts the power ofscience to effect action at a distance and transform the world and its inhabitants.Commodities embodying such science, however, just like the classes in PhysicalScience taught in schools, images of industrial and technological power, or thedoctors staffing clinics and hospitals, have an irreducibly alien feel in this context.They are not indigenous, not African. They are ‘things of Whites’. Even when thescientists or doctors are black and African, they are not practising Africanscience.African science is another, secret, sphere of knowledge. While no-one will admit tohaving mastered African science, to doubt that it is every bit as powerful as ‘White’science is tantamount to betraying a lack of faith in the African ‘race’.16 In historical times the king, whose ancestors ruled over the fortunes of the wholepeople, employed the services of diviners who, by virtue of their standing (sometimeshereditary) in relation to the king were viewed as possessing powers capable ofpreserving the fortunes of the whole nation and diminishing their enemies (Pettersson1953). Such arrangements may persist in some of the rural polities, but people inurban areas, especially those long-settled in towns beyond the purview of chiefly rule,have no access to such spiritual power outside churches. 17 Christian evangelists have long wrangled with questions of how best to engage withbeliefs and practices associated with witchcraft.

The main goal of the research programme was to gather empiricalevidence on witchcraft phenomena and its impacts on development – moreprecisely, to come up with policy prescriptions on how best to fight suchphenomena. At the outset, a critical assumption, based on anecdotal evidence,was that witchcraft was a major barrier to development in the country. Forreasons that are quite interesting in themselves, as we shall see in the secondhalf of this chapter, the project never really took off. Yet it triggered a long seriesof articles by Fisiy on ‘witchcraft’, especially on the judicial aspects of thegovernment’s efforts to deal with it.For Geschiere, the confrontation came somewhat earlier, when he startedanthropological fieldwork in the early 1970s in a set of neighbouring Makavillages in the East Province. The aim of his project was not to study ‘witchcraft’.The focus was rather on changing relations between villagers and the state; anddevelopment projects, as possible bones of contention, were to provide concretepoints of entry into understanding these relations. However, one of his morestartling findings was that it was state officials who, when addressing develop-ment issues, constantly referred to witchcraft. Indeed, a recurring theme in theiradmonitions – harangues might be a better word – to villagers was that theyshould stop sabotaging the state’s projects, or le développementin general, withtheir witchcraft. At least initially, villagers were somewhat reticent to discussdjambe(now generally translated as sorcellerie). But once they agreed to discussthis more hidden side of everyday relations, there seemed to be no end to thestories they told about the working of occult forces, notably in more ‘modern’contexts (school, football, the rise of a new elite, etc.).Our personal experiences, therefore, correspond to an initial suggestion bythis volume’s editors that ‘development’ might offer a more concrete startingpoint – than, for instance, the broad notion of ‘modernity’ – to explore theChapter 11Witchcraft, development andparanoia in CameroonInteractions between popular, academicand state discourseCyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"resilience of witchcraft representations in modern contexts. One could objectthat development has become as vague a notion as modernity (or witchcraft).However, this was different in the 1970s and early 1980s. In those days‘development’ still provided a confident metanarrative, anchored firmly inpowerful institutional settings (Ferguson 1999; Escobar 1995). In some sortof rebound with this firm notion of development, even witchcraft seemed, atthe time, to acquire clearly outlined contours: it figured in this context as athreatening, levelling mechanism – a hidden, traditionalist refusal of everythingdevelopment stood for. In conjunction with a dirigiste state agenda, develop-ment discourse was conceptualized as a linear process, the ultimate destinationof which was the production of modernity, a modern state. Anything that stoodin the way, witchcraft beliefs and practices included, was considered a legitimatetarget for state intervention. Since the 1980s, matters have seemingly become more complicated. The per-ception of development as a destination which should be pursued collectively bythe state as part of the common good has been muted. The pursuit of modernityhas become a personal enterprise based on the accumulation of individualwealth. The old role-model of the fonctionnairewith his school certificates andhis career in government service tends to be replaced by people’s fascinationwith the feymenof Cameroon or the 419s of Nigeria – unscrupulous fixers whohave become dazzlingly rich.2And these shadowy figures are often related to avery different aspect of ‘witchcraft’, to what could be called its ‘accumulative’side.This apparent shift in the way ‘witchcraft’ is linked to ‘development’ – from asupposedly levelling force in the 1960s and 1970s to more emphasis on itsaccumulative capacities in more recent times – is especially intriguing. Elsewhere(Fisiy and Geschiere 1991; Geschiere 1997) we tried to show that it is preciselythis ambivalence of being a force for both levelling and accumulation of powerand riches that explains why witchcraft remains such an omnipresent image inpresent-day Africa, despite all modern changes. Witchcraft is often associatedwith jealousy – that is, with hidden aggression by the weak against the rich andpowerful. It is this levelling side that mostly comes to the fore in formalaccusations when those in power accuse people in a weaker position of trying tobring them down. However, at a more hidden level, witchcraft is equallyassociated with those who are doing well. Rumours also link it to the rich andpowerful who allegedly owe their success to the use of varied occult sources andforces. Even if this supposed link between accumulation and witchcraft is notoften expressed in public accusations – how could the weak dare accuse those inpower? – this association seems to be currently accepted as self-evident. It is thisambivalence of witchcraft, its Janus-faced character, in relation to the newinequalities that makes these beliefs so all-pervasive and resilient. It is also clearthat the emphasis can shift from one side to the other – from people being morepreoccupied with the levelling side of witchcraft to more gossip about itsaccumulative side and vice versa, depending on the context and time.

Therefore, we propose towrite them in the I-form: the ‘I’ in each part referring to the researcher concerned.‘We’ refers to our joint interpretations.Fieldwork among the Maka: witchcraft as popular reaction orofficials’ paranoia?When I (Geschiere) began fieldwork among the Maka in East Cameroon inthe 1970s, I was determined to follow more ‘modern’ currents in anthropology.For one thing, I wanted to move beyond the restrictive focus on ‘the local’ thathad, to then, featured so integrally to the ethnographic enterprise. At the time,the notion of ‘local level politics’ (Swartz 1968) was quite fashionable: anthro-pologists should learn to study the politics in ‘their’ community not as localaffairs, but rather as part of a broader political framework – most notably, thatof the state. My aim was therefore to study how local relations of authoritywere affected by broader political changes, especially de-colonization and theformation of the postcolonialstate. This also meant, so I thought, that onlylimited attention could be paid to the more ‘traditional’ aspects of village life.I was prepared to take kinship seriously, as an important framework for localstructures, but I was less interested in topics like bridewealth, witchcraft andso on.It soon turned out that, as far as bridewealth was concerned, there was littlechance of my ignoring it. The people of the lineage that adopted me because Icame to live in their part of the village – to them it was self-evident that thismade me mwane Andjag, child of Andjag – simply insisted I attend all their bride-wealth negotiations. The least I could do in return for their hospitality, after all,was to strengthen their numbers at such negotiations with my presence as atangue (lit., a pink one). This meant my sitting for many long afternoons throughrowdy confrontations between the bride’s and groom’s groups, drinking toomuch palm wine, and feeling rather uncertain about my role in all this tumult.With witchcraft, things were somewhat different. At the time, no one spoketoo much or too openly about la sorcellerie. The ideology of the one-party state –that certainly had some local resonance, albeit often at unexpected moments –emphasized that la sorcelleriewas something backward that had to be overcomeas quickly as possible.3One of the local village elites where I lived, a regionalinspector for education who also held high positions in the Party and themunicipality, had an admonishing notice above the entrance to his office:‘Be brief. We have to do in four decades what Europe did in four centuries.’Talking about witchcraft – certainly for an anthropologist – meant primitivizingCameroon and denying it the progress it had made towards development. I thus228 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"found it all the more surprising that none other than the sous-préfethimself raisedthe issue on one of his visits to the village to inspect a development project.The main reason I had settled in this particular village was precisely becauseof this development project. Just before my arrival in the East, the governmenthad launched a new co-operative organization, ZAPI (zone d’action prioritaireintegrée), with strong support of French development experts. ZAPI was stronglyinfluenced by the ideology of animation, the French version of ‘communitydevelopment’. Its aim was to strengthen peasants’ involvement in the develop-ment of cash-cropping (particularly cocoa and coffee). For this, the peasants hadto be organized and encouraged to take responsibility for running their own co-operatives. Of course, this more democratic approach was difficult to reconcilewith the highly authoritarian and bureaucratic approach of the one-party state,and, for this reason, the sous-préfetkept a keen eye on developments in theZAPI area. The ZAPI people asked me to work in one of their new zones, sothat I could write reports on issues of importance to their projects (e.g. access toland, relations between the villages, but especially issues of leadership). Thesous-préfet,whose authorization I needed for all my activities, seemed to see me asa welcome informal source of information on what ZAPI was up to in this zone.In the village where I settled, ZAPI wanted to establish a pilot project theyhoped would demonstrate to locals the advantages of their approach. Thevillage had asked for a new school building. ZAPI provided the necessary fundsfor building materials, and villagers themselves promised to do the necessarywork. Not unexpectedly, this latter part proved to be the weakest link in theproject. Every Thursday – then officially the day for communal work in thewhole country – the village chief paraded up and down the village in search oflabourers, but mostly in vain. Most people left early for their own plantations inorder to avoid the corvéefor the school building. Apparently, they were moreinterested in working for their own benefit than for the village school. It was inthis stalemate that the sous-préfetintervened, clearly delighted to show that hisauthoritarian approach was the only effective one. Yet, his interpretation of theproblem was somewhat unexpected. He made the village chief announce thatthe following Thursday he himself would survey the school works and thateverybody had better be there. Indeed, that Thursday quite a crowd gathered –in those days, people’s fear of the gendarmesstill lent force to the words of a sous-préfet. The latter arrived as usual in a hurry and his speech was, again as usual,brief but effective: the government was following the school project with greatimpatience, the village people had to take it more seriously; otherwise he had tointervene.4Yet, towards the end of his speech, he was suddenly impassioned ashe shouted at the crowd: ‘I’ll tell you one thing. You have to stop sabotagingeverything the government is trying to do for you with your damned witchcraft!The persons who are behind all this may think they remain invisible. Well, I seethem and I know how to get them.’5To this official, la sorcelleriewas apparently the main impediment todevelopment.

It was seen as one of themost backward parts precisely because it was supposed to be infested withwitchcraft. A brief scene, quite comical but at the same time shocking, illustratesthis point.In 1971, at the start of my fieldwork, Mr Ayissi-Mvodo, then Minister ofTerritorial Administration and often mentioned as a possible crown-princeto President Ahidjo, came to visit the East Province. The UNC, the one-party, had organized an impressive welcome at Abong-Mbang, the maintown in Maka land. The school children stood ready in their uniformswaving small flags. Shops and offices had been closed and the gendarmessawto it that everybody had joined the crowd to welcome the venerable guest.After making the people wait for two hours in the hot sun, the ministerarrived. He mounted the platform decorated with palm branches. Thenational hymn was played (luckily from a tape, since the crowd did notjoin in – clearly this was not even expected of them in the strictly directedceremony). Then the minister started his speech. The first phrase was astrong one: ‘Before I came to the East I had the impression that the peoplehere were only interested in arki(local liquor) and sorcellerie.’ Clearly, theminister wanted to go on to say that this prejudice had now been dispelled.But, unfortunately, before doing so, he paused briefly. The applause master,interpreting this as a sign for him to become active, beckoned the crowdwith furious gestures to applaud, which they did obediently. Whatever theminister’s intentions, he had once again confirmed the usual stereotypeabout the East.At the time, this association with sorcelleriehad specific, political implications.The one-party ideology of the Ahidjo regime, simple but repeated encore ettoujoursat any official occasion, was based on a Manichaean opposition of twobasic themes: ‘unity’ versus ‘subversion’, with ‘vigilance’ as the crucial link. Thespecial circumstances of Cameroonian independence – marked by a tenaciousguerrilla movement of the UPC-opposition (the first nationalist movement inthe country) in the Centre and west of the country – made for a heavy emphasison an omnipresent danger of hidden ‘subversion’ that, supposedly, threatenedthe admirable national ideal of ‘unity’ behind President Ahidjo. Indeed, underthe strict police control that the regime imposed on the nation, a simpleaccusation of ‘subversion’ could be enough to occasion someone’s disappearance– probably (but one was never sure) to Tcholliré, Ahidjo’s feared concentrationcamp in the North. The official insistence on ‘vigilance’ as the main duty of allparty members and, indeed, of all Cameroonian citizens further reinforced theidea that ‘subversion’ lurked everywhere. Moreover, the emphasis on the hiddencharacter of ‘subversion’ made it easy to link to sorcellerie. Since the early 1970s,the Ahidjo regime had succeeded in suppressing nearly all forms of open230 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"resistance against the new state. Its ‘hegemonic project’ (Bayart 1979) assumedever more totalitarian pretensions, aiming to control strictly all aspects of dailylife. In this extremely centralized conception of a complete bureaucratic surveil-lance of society – a conception that had concrete effects, even if reality wasoften quite different – la sorcellerieremained an uncomfortable exception:apparently very real to the people, yet very hard to control because of its hiddenand diffuse character.Like the sous-préfetquoted above, Minister Ayissi-Mvodo was, therefore,evoking a heavily charged topic when he linked the East to la sorcellerie.Particular aspects of the societies of the area can help explain why officials madethis link so easily. Maka society, like other forest societies, was up until thecolonial conquest (1905–1910) extremely segmentary in nature. Small patrilinealsegments formed autonomous villages under the leadership of elders. Commondescent but even more marriage and affinity created links between the villages,but these could at any time be ruptured by feuds. There were no central positionsof authority above the village level. Moreover, village life was (and is)characterized by strong levelling tendencies: the ever-present tendencies towardsfission implied in the kinship organization, and the impact of jealousy andwitchcraft.6This mixture of segmentary tendencies and powerful levelling forcesmade these societies very problematic for colonial attempts at ‘pacification’ (seeGeschiere 1982; Wirz 1972). In postcolonial times, with the rise of an ideologyof development and animation, the same traits led to a quite frantic search for‘responsible leaders’. Typically one of the first topics that ZAPI (the parastatalco-operative in Maka land, mentioned above) required me to research wascomment déceler de vrais leaders?(how to detect true leaders?). To the ZAPIpeople, their more participatory approach to involve the peasants in projects toraise the productivity in the zone – in contrast to the high-handed bureaucraticapproach of both the colonial and the postcolonial state – required first of all tofind ‘real leaders’ who could speak on behalf of the peasants and ensure theircommitment to ZAPI goals and projects. But the contradiction between astrongly egalitarian ideology at the village level7and the extremely authori-tarian impositions by the (post) colonial state seemed to make the quest for suchleaders illusory.The Maka discourse on djambe(now generally translated as sorcellerie) reflectsthe segmentary and levelling implications of this loose, socio-political order.Djambeis a highly diffuse and open notion. Like evu(the parallel notion amongthe Beti, the Maka’s western neighbours who now play a prominent role in thestate under ‘their’ President Paul Biya), it encompasses myriad hidden forces.The djambe imaginary has a horrible, black core: the image of witches(mindjindjamb) leaving their bodies at night and flying off to meet their fellowwitches. Each witch must take his or her turn in ‘offering’ a relative for acannibalistic feast. The victim will then fall ill and die unless a traditionalhealer (nganga) removes the spell.8It is the betrayal of kinship, even more thanthe act of cannibalism, that is most shocking to the Maka. But such imaginingsDevelopment and paranoia in Cameroon 231"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"do not preclude that the djambecan also be brought under control, for instanceby the good services of a nganga, who actually himself can only help since hehas learnt to restrain his powerful djambeand use it for healing. Indeed, once thedjambeis brought under control, it becomes a positive asset and can be used forall sorts of constructive purposes. For this reason, one can even use the term tomean a special kind of energy as, for instance, when someone compliments ahost for preparing a nice reception by saying that his djambeallowed him to doit. Moreover, the Maka tend to believe that, potentially, virtually everyone has adjambein his or her belly; but that only some endeavour to develop it to gainaccess to special kinds of powers. Because djambeis such a diffuse notion –because it covers such an array of aspects, both negative and positive – it is, inpractice, decidedly a-moral. Again, this contrasts starkly with the morehierarchical societies of the west (Bamileke, Bamenda) where the witchcraftdiscourse is much more ‘compartmentalized’, and various institutionalmechanisms serve to separate, at least conceptually, more destructive from moreconstructive expressions of the occult, even though in practice these are oftenmore confused.9For the Maka, djambecan therefore take many forms. But it is clear that oneof its basic expressions is closely linked to jealousy. In this sense, djambeis aconsequential levelling force. It must have been this strain of djambediscoursethat figured in official discourses – of both state officials and developers – as afundamentally anti-development force. For villagers, too, djambehad suchimplications. It was supposed to function as a weapon of the weak and thejealous against their more successful kin. Therefore, since development clearlybrought new inequalities, djambewas, indeed, seen as an acute danger to thosewho tried to profit from the new opportunities.My fieldwork provided many examples of this. A striking one was the gbati, anew form of witchcraft that had suddenly spread in the area, a few years beforemy arrival in 1971 (see Geschiere 1980). People were still searching franticallyfor ways to combat this new threat, that would have come from the Mvelle tothe northwest of the Maka region. It was especially frightening since it wascarried by young boys. Normally, elders were seen as the undisputed masters ofthe secret world of djambe but, with gbatithe young were suddenly the masters ofthe old! I witnessed palavers that were strongly reminiscent of the Salemwitchcraft trials in eighteenth-century New England, in which young girlsplayed a central role. Similarly, in the gbatitrials, young boys confessed to hideouscrimes: some claimed to have eaten holes in the local village school teacher’sheart; or to have buried bamboo splinters under the doors of their parents’houses to make them ill or even die; or to have stopped the Presbyterian pastorfrom preaching at the village chapel (van Dijk, Chapter 5). This formerlyunknown evil was so new that established ngangawere at an utter loss for how tocombat it. My good friend Mendouga, a prominent ngangaalong the piste,losther reputation because she was wholly incapable of dealing with this novelthreat. In fact, during one of the gbatipalavers she claimed to have been nearly232 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"overcome herself – she was only saved by her dog whose furious barking hadwarned her only just in time, or else she would have been ligotée(tied up) bythese treacherous child-witches. But a new ngangaemerged, Ayindale, from aneighbouring village, who knew how to deal with this threat: during a bigpalaver, he forced the boys to eat enormous quantities of very greasy food (lotsof oil and meat) until they vomited. From their puke, he produced several piecesof cord with knots in them – each knot stood for one victim.10The story of gbatiis a continuing one: gbatihas evolved and it still crops up, now and then, invillage rumours, though it has lost much of its frightening character; peoplehave become accustomed to it. In the context of this chapter it is of specialinterest that this gbati, when it entered the region at the end of the 1960s, hadsuch a strong anti-developmental stance. The gbatiboys directed their angeragainst everything that stood for development in the village: the school, itsteacher, the church, the village elite.A similar example of witchcraft directed against development was a popularsaying that several people, especially elderly ones, quoted to me in 1971 – thougheven then they insisted that it applied more to former days than to the present:‘No man who plants a cocoa tree will live to reap its fruits.’ This is, indeed, astrong threat since normally a cocoa tree begins producing only four years afterbeing planted. The implication was clear. Cocoa was the first successful cash-crop in the forest area (it spread rapidly especially since the late 1940s). Thus itsymbolized the new riches of ambitious planteurs. However, my informantsremembered that, in former times, people were afraid to follow the government’sadmonitions to join in the cocoa boom. Was it not dangerous to kindle thejealousy of poorer relatives? The admonition that ‘. . . you would not live to reapthe fruits’ was, at the time, a powerful caveat. Again, this provides a clearexample of witchcraft as a barrier to development. However, in this case, thedouble meaning of witchcraft is quite apparent. My first reaction when I heardthis particular popular wisdom was to point out that since the 1950s manyvillagers had planted cocoa trees, and with considerable success. Since the1960s, each village in the region could boast of a new elite of grands planteurs,who were proud of their extensive cocoa plantations. At this, my informantsnormally replied that, indeed, people had understood that this witchcraft banon cocoa was nonsense. However, on closer inspection, this common-senseexplanation turned out to be far too simple. Striking was that, in one way oranother, nearly all the grands planteurswere easily associated with witchcraft.Indeed, as one of my most valuable informants – a true ‘peasant intellectual’ –remarked: how could they be ‘innocent’ if they had dared to brave the threat ofjealousy, that is witchcraft, of their poorer relatives by joining in the race for thenew cocoa riches? They must have had some sort of occult protection. Suchsuggestions clearly indicate that witchcraft had not only levelling implicationsin relation to development. Yet, in general, it is clear that to villagers as well djambecould have levellingeffects. Less clear is whether they really saw djambeas a ‘subversive’ forceDevelopment and paranoia in Cameroon 233"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"directed against the state and its projects, or against le développementmorebroadly. On the contrary, ordinary villagers seemed rather taken aback by thesous-préfet’s and other officials’ accusations against them. Moreover, I neverheard any rumours that villagers were actually using, or were trying to use, secretforces to undermine such ambitious projects (which is striking in itself, giventhe sheer number of constantly changing witchcraft rumours on every topicimaginable). Rather, occult assaults were supposedly directed against specificpersons, mostly relatives – which, indeed, corresponds to the highly personalizednature of djambediscourse and the emphasis on the close links between djambeand kinship (bjel).11It seems, therefore, that the image of la sorcellerieas thesupreme form of subversion was more the result of official paranoia than ofanything else. The link officials made between ‘witchcraft’ and ‘subversion’ –supposedly directed against the state, the new national order and, therefore,development – clearly corresponded to the rigid one-party ideology, obsessed asit was with the need for constant vigilance against omnipresent but hiddensubversion. For villagers, djambewas rather about hidden aggression againstindividuals and, more specifically, aggression from ‘within the house’.We will return in this chapter to the subsequent collapse of the developmentdream in the region with the crisis of 1987, and the implications for witchcraftdiscourses. As already noted, witchcraft then seemed to show another face inrelation to development. But first we want to explore how the official vision ofwitchcraft as a barrier to development manifested itself in other fields.The state against witchcraft: the search for rationalityin the occultApart from occasional harangues, as illustrated above, by préfetsand sous-préfetson the anti-developmental nature of witchcraft and the government’s determ-ination to fight these practices, there was little in the state’s armoury to carryout such a fight. The basic strategy for dealing with the topic was to approach itas a matter of law and order, and to classify witchcraft as a crime againstindividual safety and group security. In fact, the attempt to incriminate suchpractices was captured in the loosely-worded Article 251 of the 1967 Penal Codeas follows: Whoever commits any act of witchcraft, magic or divination liable todisturb public order or tranquillity, or to harm another person, property orsubstance, whether by taking a reward or otherwise, shall be punished withimprisonment for from two to ten years, and with a fine of five thousand toone hundred thousand francs.Practical guidance given to magistrates on how to apply the law stressed that theincriminating facts should be those that are liable to disturb public order andtranquillity or to harm another person and/or his property. What the constitutive234 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"elements of the crime were, in terms of actus reusand mens rea, were never fullyspecified. It should therefore come as no surprise that this legal instrument fordealing with witchcraft proved to be a rather blunt and ineffectual tool forfighting anti-developmental tendencies. The ambivalence in the interpretationof this text was such that it could be used to persecute alleged witches but alsothose members of the community who devoted their time to fight witchcraft as‘witch-doctors’, so long as their acts could be classified as falling within therealm of witchcraft, magic and divination. The fundamental question is why the law insisted on incriminating anactivity or belief which the law itself could not even define. To what extent didthe practices enunciated in Article 251 disturb public order and tranquillity? I(Fisiy) would argue that the concept of public order and tranquillity is at thecentre of this offence and that it has to be seen as an extension of state controlover local communities. Any alternative source of power not mediated by stateinstitutions was seen – especially by local level bureaucrats such as the préfetandsous-préfet– as undermining the core attribute of command and control. Theelusive nature of the witchcraft enigma and the lack of materiality in itspractices and manifestations rendered it even more ominous to the adminis-tration. It was perceived as a countervailing force that could not be handled in acommand and control power context. Almost twenty years after the enactment of the Penal Code, the limits of thisinstrument became obvious to the politico-administrative elite. Despite the law,stories of witchcraft accusations and counter-accusations provided the basiccontent of local tabloid newspapers. It had simply become a major societal viruswith no cure. It is therefore not surprising that with the persistence of witchcraftdiscourse and praxis, the government commissioned the Institute of HumanStudies (IHS) in 1985 to investigate to what extent witchcraft was a hindranceto development and what should be done about it. An interdisciplinary approachwas adopted, bringing together social scientists, economists, philosophers, andlawyers to assess the impact of ‘the belief in witchcraft’ on developmentprogrammes. Framing the issue this way, in terms of the ‘belief ’ in witchcraft, was already asubtle departure from the initial question. First, the location of the study withinthe Anthropological Department (Centre de Recherches en Anthropologie– CREAof the IHS) was quite indicative of the field of study. Second, the predominanceof philosophical research at this centre, headed by a philosopher, structured themanner in which the witchcraft problematic was presented. In fact, a prioriassumptions led to the framing of witchcraft discourse and research proposal interms of belief. Preliminary discussions among the philosophers on the teamdrifted towards more general notions of African belief systems and cosmology. Rather than pose the witchcraft problematic in terms of cause and effectresearch questions, researchers instead sought to establish the causal linkbetween the relative underdevelopment of certain regions of the country andthe preponderance of witchcraft beliefs. The challenge was not how to establishDevelopment and paranoia in Cameroon 235"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"this link, it was one of seeking solutions to sever this link. A more probingapproach would have been to pose the initial question suggested by the Ministriesof Territorial Administration and Social Affairs – to ask whether witchcraft wasa barrier to development. However, my colleagues seemed to assume that thiswas, indeed, the case. Thus the main question for the team became rather howto help the government fight witchcraft since it was seen to be a self-evidentroadblock to development. The search for effective instruments for dealing withwitchcraft became the object of study. This entry point justified my own focuson how to establish proof in witchcraft cases. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggested that educated elite from certainparts of the country, including the East Province (where Geschiere did hisfieldwork and the examples above come from), were particularly prone towitchcraft attacks and were therefore reluctant to return to their home areas forfear of being ‘eaten’ by witches. In fact, there was a common saying in thoseparts of Cameroon that the tombstones in front of every beautiful modern housewere the last abode of elites who ventured to build in their home areas, but whowere immediately killed by their jealous kin. Getting elite sons of the land toinvest in their home areas was seen as a major developmental challenge. Thiswould account for the backwardness of especially the forest regions of thecountry. Moreover, this fear of the homeland would be a major factor contri-buting to the rural exodus. This was the background to the aforementioned research programme. Initially,my colleagues were quite excited at being called upon to research and proposepolicy changes on how to deal with witchcraft. But their enthusiasm soon fadedwhen we began to carry out our programme and numerous conflicting commit-ments emerged. In fact, during the few meetings on the topic, some colleaguesexpressed their reservations about whether they really wanted to be associatedwith the study. Some claimed that all those who studied witchcraft were eitherwitches themselves or would be consumed by the phenomenon and wouldconsequently die. For me, as the law expert on the team, it was much easier toapproach the study from a technical platform that sought to establish proof inwitchcraft cases. By avoiding broader epistemological questions, I could continueto examine court files, and talk to judges and expert witnesses. Although the local papers were full of witchcraft accounts, most of theseaccounts reported incidents of mob justice, lynching, and/or trial by ordealprocedures implemented by traditional authorities. There was little systematicevidence that the courts had pursued a rigorous anti-witchcraft policy. On closeranalysis of why the courts were not aggressive in their pursuit of witchcraftcases, it became evident that their main problem was how to establish proofbeyond a reasonable doubt. The judges had to deal with the dead weight ofbinding precedent bequeathed by the colonial legal system. A comparativeanalysis of the colonial and the postcolonial legal systems highlighted somestriking differences. The colonial courts invariably situated witchcraft accusationwithin a discourse of modernity. As Seidman (1965a: 1140) pointed out, for236 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"witchcraft accusations to stand in court, ‘the threats must be physical not meta-physical. The threat must be such that a reasonable Englishman would recognize,not the sort which would seem frightening only to an African steeped in theculture of the bush.’12The colonial assumption was that witchcraft beliefs were based on a ‘pre-scientific’ perception of events. If only the people were better informed aboutthe laws of causation, they would give up such pre-scientific ideas and adoptrational behaviour. Consequently, the colonial strategy was to emphasize theimportance of education, especially of women, who were seen as the primaryeducators at home, and as agents of change for future generations. A broadermodernization programme – as part of the civilizing mission of the colonialpowers – was supposed to bring about the eradication of witchcraft. Belief in thelatter was attributed to the forces of darkness; hence the expectation that theintroduction of electricity would bring an end to the entire witchcraftphenomenon. From the standpoint of the colonial courts, the belief in witchcraftwas therefore a result of knowledge deficit. Broadening the knowledge basethrough education would be the answer. Seidman (1965b: 59) postulated that‘the Africans who now control their countries, educated as they are to thehighest standards of European culture, will not accept a pre-scientific standardof knowledge and behaviour’ (see Nyamnjoh, Chapter 2). After independence the official perception of witchcraft began to change. Itwas no longer seen as just a form of pre-scientific knowledge that woulddisappear with modernization, but rather as active resistance against modern-ization and development. The new Penal Code of 1967 – and the way it wasenacted – constituted a turning point. Under the colonial system, witches weresystematically set free when charged with the practice of witchcraft because itwas impossible to prove the crime in court; instead those who used traditionalmeans of proof against alleged witches were sentenced for assault or relatedcrimes. No wonder the local population saw the colonial legal system as an allyof the witch against the people. However, people expected this to change withindependence and the Africanization of the state apparatus. And, indeed, aftersome initial hesitation, it became increasingly clear that under postcolonial rulethe courts began to approach the same offence differently (see Niehaus, Chapter9). It was notably the vision of witchcraft as an anti-developmental force thatencouraged the forces of orders to try and act against it.By framing the belief in witchcraft as a developmental challenge – and not asa modernization problem that would disappear with the acquisition of Europeanculture – the administration and the judiciary crossed some critical thresholds:witchcraft ceased to be seen as only a threat that originates from ‘the intimacyof the house’ (Geschiere 1997: 46). It had now been transformed into a broadersocietal crime that the courts were mandated to punish. Thus, the predominantnotion that witchcraft was based on some form of mystical cannibalism of kin,was expanded; witchcraft was now seen increasingly as a broader societalchallenge whereby witches used their occult powers to thwart developmentDevelopment and paranoia in Cameroon 237"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"projects. It was especially this broadening of the scope of witchcraft beyondkinship bonds to cover a much wider array of unexplainable happenings thattipped the scales in favour of using the law to protect development. However, byturning the judicial system into an instrument of a development agenda, thenew nation-builders also undermined the basis of the law as a neutral arbiter inregulating societal interactions. Moreover, it is quite clear that, even thoughthere was heavy pressure on the courts to intervene, any action against witcheswas complicated by considerable judicial problems – notably the question ofhow to establish proof in this shady domain. For this, clearly, a judge would haveto go directly against colonial precedence. I decided, therefore, to focus my research for the larger IHS programmementioned above on Sorcellerie et Développementon a series of court cases in theEastern Province that had attracted considerable nationwide attention. Around1980, the Eastern Courts quite abruptly began to condemn ‘witches’ to quitedrastic punishments: up to ten years in jail and substantial fines. In Cameroon,people generally saw this as a major breakthrough: finally the law showed itselfready to deal with this major threat. But the general sentiment was also that itwas no wonder that these cases took place in the East – a place where, after all,everybody knew witchcraft was running wild. Eventually, I was able to gainaccess through personal contacts to a set of thirty files on recent witchcraft trialsbefore the Court of Appeal of Bertoua (the capital of the East Province),including reports on earlier judgements by various tribunaux de première instancein the East.Elsewhere we published a more extensive analysis of these files, focusingparticularly on the crucial role of local ‘witch-doctors’ (nganga) as key witnessesfor the prosecution in these cases (see Fisiy and Geschiere 1990; Fisiy 1990a,1990b). For the present chapter, two aspects of these files are of particularinterest. First is the emphasis both judges and state attorneys put on witchcraftas a major threat to development – completely in line with the examples above– in order to justify their drastic interventions against this hidden threat.Striking is, for instance, the almost passionate appeal of the state attorneybefore the Bertoua Court: We are all Africans. We should not pretend that witchcraft does not exist.It is very much alive here in the East Province. We cannot allow all theseprimitive villagers to threaten government agents who are transferred towork here in the East. It is witchcraft that is drawing back development inthis province. (Fisiy 1990a)A second relevant aspect of these files is the thorny issue, already referred toabove, of how to establish proof. The courts’ problem here is perhaps best sum-marized by the judge of the tribunal de première instanceof Batouri (also in theEast Province) in his summing up of the case against a woman who was involved238 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"in an extramarital affair with a policeman in 1984; she was accused of renderinghim impotent – or, in any case, incapable of having sexual relations with anyother woman except her. In the judgement, the Court of Appeal said, per curiam:Considering the fact that witchcraft cannot be established scientifically;Considering the fact that modern medicines was ineffective in this case;Holds that only the firm conviction of the judge can guide him during thesubmissions in court.This is a classic example of how the courts try to reconcile different forms ofknowledge. It acknowledges that witchcraft cannot be proved scientifically, butit also emphasizes that modern medicine was ineffective in order to justify itsconclusions that the impotence must therefore have been caused by witchcraft.The court decided, indeed, that a genuine case had been established, and theaccused was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison. The final proof inthis case, as in many others, rested on the nebulous concept of the judge’s firmconviction (l’intime conviction du juge) (Fisiy 1990a). The wide discretionary powers of the judge were based on a new form ofmissionary zeal to fight anti-developmental practices which rendered certainregions inhospitable to civil servants and resistant to the state’s agenda. Thecourt felt that by meting out such harsh punishment it would soften the groundsand make it much more conducive for foreigners to live in the locality. It shouldbe borne in mind that this wave of witchcraft incriminations was targeted againstsupposedly anti-communitarian occult practices. This case shows again how witchcraft was shifted from a domestic affair to anoffence against public order and tranquillity. To justify this, the courts usuallyapplied Article 251, cited above (p. 234), in conjunction with Article 228 thatpunishes ‘dangerous activities’. But even a combined reading of both articlesdoes not provide the courts with any clear guidance on what course of conductto follow. Hence, the interpretation and incrimination of the offence of witchcraftunder the law has remained essentially discretionary, dependent on the judge’swhims and caprices. This might also explain the considerable regional variationsin the judicial action against ‘witches’: quite common in the East since 1980,but until now much less so in other provinces.All this raises the question of whether the law is, in fact, an appropriateinstrument to regulate culturally-grounded beliefs like witchcraft that areconsidered anti-developmental. The judicial basis of such actions seems to bevery shaky. In our earlier article (Fisiy and Geschiere 1990) we also pointed tomore practical reasons for doubting the efficacy of the judicial action on thisscore. Towards the end of the 1980s, some of the ‘witches’ who had beenconvicted and jailed reached the end of their term and were released. However,this raised the colossal question of their re-integration into society. The normalway to deal with dangerous witches is to invoke a nganga’s assistance toneutralize witches’ dangerous powers. The state’s sanctions have proved muchDevelopment and paranoia in Cameroon 239"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"less effective. Sending people to jail does not neutralize their powers. On thecontrary, people say that this is where one meets reallycunning maraboutswhoteach unknown secrets. No wonder the return of convicted ‘witches’ has createdenormous practical problems. There is, indeed, good reason to doubt the state’scapacity to deal with witchcraft.The collapse of development: a new face of witchcraft?In the end, it may not have been witchcraft that brought down the dream ofdevelopment in the area, but rather some dramatic changes in the broadereconomic and political environment. Especially after the onset of the crisis inJune 1987, formally announced by President Biya on TV and radio, it becameclear that development – in any case, the recipe tried out until then, roughly sum-marized as a combination of cash-cropping and jobs in public service – was rapidlycollapsing.The first signs were the increasing difficulties in the 1980s of ZAPI – the co-operative that had a monopoly to buy the main cash-crops, cocoa and coffee –to pay farmers. There were constant rumours about financial malversations. Thewithdrawal of the French agents techniquesmade it all the easier for those inpower, from inside but especially from outside ZAPI, to ‘borrow’ from its fundsand use them for other purposes. During the annual cocoa and coffee campaigns,ZAPI was regularly forced to pay farmers with certificates that were of highlyquestionable value. However, people managed to circumvent this by smugglingtheir harvests out of ZAPI zones – for instance, by bringing them across the river– to districts where private traders were still allowed. The real blow came in1989 and subsequent years when world market prices for both cocoa and coffeecollapsed. The national caisse de stabilisation, whose job it was to accumulatelevies during years of high prices in order to compensate farmers in years whenprices fell, proved to be empty. Again, it was quite clear that the funds accumul-ated during the preceding years had been used for other purposes. Theconsequences were dramatic. In some villages, bags of cocoa stood rotting by theroadside since no one came to buy them. In 1991, the people of ‘my’ villageasked me desperately whether I might be able to organize some way for them tosell their cocoa and coffee since nobody seemed to want it anymore.During the 1990s, this implosion of the cash-crop sector was complementedby the crisis of the state. Whatever structural adjustment may have done inCameroon, it dramatically effected the position of civil servants. The shrinkageof the state apparatus led to dismissals and forced retirements on a large scale.Many civil servants had the shock of suddenly receiving, without warning, a‘zero pay-slip’, meaning that their employment had come to an abrupt end.Especially at the beginning of the decade, salaries were not paid for months onend. But it was, above all, the dramatic decrease of the salaries that had a lastingeffect. Due to several consecutive cuts, by 1993 salaries had been reduced by asmuch as 60 per cent. The subsequent devaluation of the FCFA (by more than240 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"50 per cent) further reduced the real value of civil servants’ income.13Even thefilles libresof Yaounde started to complain that it was no longer any use to go outwith a fonctionnaire.All this meant that the notion of development has acquired an ironic – orrather a sarcastic – ring, even in Cameroon.14It is quite striking that in thiscontext ‘witchcraft’ also became much more ambiguous in its daily implications.The rather simplistic, official version of witchcraft as a levelling force and as abarrier to development is no longer tenable. As already noted, the witchcraftdiscourse is much richer in its implications – or, to evoke a less positive image, itis like the many-headed Hydra snake of Greek mythology, producing a new headeach time Heracles chopped one off. In a similar vein, witchcraft discourses areapparently capable of producing ever-new meanings: there are obvious levellingovertones, but they can easily acquire accumulative implications as well.Among the Maka,djambe– like evuamong the Beti – is, for instance, seen asindispensable to any chief or leader. Under certain circumstances it encouragesand protects the accumulation of wealth instead of undermining it. It seems thatthe development ideology of the 1960s and 1970s, with its Manichaean contrastbetween ‘the modern’ and ‘the traditional’ – combined with a one-partyideology with parallel accents – imposed a specific reading of witchcraft asbasically anti-development and, therefore, anti-modern; but subsequent develop-ments have tended to favour other interpretations.Lately the rumours of Radio Trottoirdwell on different themes: secret ways toget rich; access to global, occult networks; the cunning of entrepreneurs –especially younger ones – who dare to go outside the established frameworks of theformal economy (Parish, Chapter 6). The increasing ambiguity is reflected inrumours about the ‘new witchcraft of wealth’, differently named in the differentregions of the country – ekongin Douala, nyongouaround Mt. Cameroon, famlaor kupe in the West and North West, kongin the forests of Central and EastCameroon – but referring to a similar set of representations (Fisiy and Geschiere1991). Ardener (1970) reports on the emergence of such notions on the slopesof Mt. Cameroon in the 1950s and de Rosny (1981) shows that in Douala, theekonggoes back as far as the eighteenth century. Yet, especially over the pastfew decades, these representations have become country-wide preoccupations.Moreover, people insist that these are new forms of witchcraft, as compared to‘normal’ forms of the ‘witchcraft of eating’ where witches give their relatives totheir fellow witches for nocturnal cannibalistic banquets. In contrast,ekong,famlaand other variants are about a witchcraft of labour. This new type of witchreputedly turns victims into zombies that are forced to work on ‘invisibleplantations’ on Mt. Kupe (in the South West, more than 100 kms to the northof Douala).15This, in effect, is the secret of their riches, for ekong, famlaand theother novel forms of witchcraft are invariably associated with the nouveaux riches.In such conceptions, the levelling version of witchcraft representationsremain. They express people’s shock about the supposedly illegitimate ways thenew rich have attained such dazzling wealth. Ardener (1970) details how suchDevelopment and paranoia in Cameroon 241"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"representations can discourage people, at least for some time, to profit from newopportunities for enrichment. However, these rumours’ message is clearly double.For the rumours also express people’s fascination with secret get-rich methods.Leaflets on how to get rich, with Mt. Kupe’s magic profile on the cover, sell verywell indeed on the free markets (see Sanders, Chapter 8). In his seminal study ofL’Esprit d’Entreprise au Cameroun, Warnier (1993) notes that nearly allsuccessful representatives of the new Bamileke bourgeoisie from the western partof the country, who now supposedly control the national economy, are popularlyassociated with famla(the local variant of the new witchcraft of wealth). But headds that such rumours do not seem to affect their prestige. Famlais increasinglyseen as a current aspect of entrepreneurial success.This fascination with the riches such occult forces can bring comes evenstronger to the fore in popular rumours about the feymen, the young successfulentrepreneurs (see p. 227), with their dandy-like behaviour and their amazingwealth that seems to come from nowhere. This whole notion is very new; it is aPidgin term, stemming from faire quelqu’unin Cameroonian French, meaning‘to trick someone’. The term feymanonly gained currency in the mid-1990s, butwithin only a few years the feymanhas become a new role model, especially forthe young.16In his challenging research proposal, Ndjio (2000) quotes a sketchfrom a popular Cameroon television programme, ‘Just for Fun’: an ageing fillelibre decides to disclose to her children the identity of the various men who haveengendered them. The eldest child is dismayed to hear his father is a professeur;the second is equally unhappy that his father turns out to be a journalist; thethird nearly attacks his mother when he hears his father is a military man; butthe youngest is overjoyed when he learns his father is a feyman.An essential element in the many stories about feymenis the magical qualityof their wealth and the global span of their operations. The archetype, DonatienKoagne, may now suffer in a prison in Yemen, but he is rumoured to haveconned several heads of state in Africa and leading French politicians with hisfalse money tricks. Actually he would have been immediately executed by theYemenites, were it not for the heavy pressure by the French who, at all costs,want to lay their hands on his carnet that contains such vital secrets (cf.Malaquais 2001). In Cameroon, his reputation was solidly established throughhis magnanimous and well-published contributions for the preparation of thenational football team for the World Cup in 1994. Other feymenalso enhancedtheir prestige through their ostentatious largesseon occasions like the recentFrance–Africa summit in Yaounde or in support of the Biya regime at electiontime. No wonder the national leadership is prepared to accord all sorts of favoursto the organizations in which feymenare supposed to participate – like SYNES-JAPCAM (Syndicat des salles des exploitants des salles de jeux et d’amusementpublics au Cameroun) or ASSOJHAC (Association des jeunes hommes d’affaires duCameroun).The contours of this enigmatic group are still far from clear.17Yet it is clearthat the magical qualities attributed to their enigmatic accumulation of wealth242 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"make the official version of ‘witchcraft’ of the 1970s as a levelling force severelyoutdated. Apparently, the forms of enrichment that have come with economicliberalization have given witchcraft discourses yet another new lease on life.Is the link with development helpful to grasp witchcraft? Can it account forwitchcraft’s surprising resilience and polyphony in present-day Africa? Theforegoing has shown that linking witchcraft to development highlights howdirectly these enigmatic and volatile discourses relate to mundane and practicalproblems. Especially in the 1960s and 1970s, at a time when ‘development’seemed a self-evident notion, ‘witchcraft’ as its counterpoint seemed to beequally unequivocal a notion. The subsequent proliferation of witchcraft and itsmany ambiguities seems to reflect the disappearance of a confident metanarrativeabout development’s trajectory. Of course, such growing uncertainty is notparticular to Africa, and cannot easily be separated from a broader loss of faithin the possibilities of social engineering. Similar uncertainties seem to become ageneral phenomenon in our globalizing world with the defeat of the state –whether of the welfare or the authoritarian type – by the requirements of ‘themarket’, leaving society at the mercy of an economy that seems increasinglyunpredictable and out of control. No wonder that, at the beginning of thetwenty-first century, magic seems to become a fixed corollary of modernity, notonly in Africa, but also in the richer parts of the world.18Notes1 We fully realize that both terms raise serious terminological problems. We use‘development’ not so much as an ideological term but rather to denote a set ofinstitutions and practices that have become an integral part of everyday life in manyparts of Africa (as Chauveau 1994 puts it: le développement est un dispositif; alsoOlivier de Sardan 1995). While we realize that ‘witchcraft’ (like sorcellerieand otherWestern terms) is an unfortunate translation of African notions that often have abroader and more ambivalent set of meanings and associations, we prefer to retainthis term due to its popularity in many parts of Africa (see also Geschiere 2000).2 We will return to these enigmatic figures, see p. 242 and n. 16.3 In the 1970s it was still the UNC (Union Nationale Camerounaise) of AhmadouAhidjo, Cameroon’s first President, that monopolized politics from the national topdown to the local level. After 1984 it was succeeded by the RDPC (the RassemblementDémocratique du Peuple Camerounaisof Paul Biya, Cameroon’s second President), thatwas equally centralistic and authoritarian. The latter party is still in power, despite theformal political liberalization since 1990. In retrospect, the heavy, not to say obsessive,one-party jargon of the 1970s and 1980s may seem to have been artificial and evenclumsy (see also p. 230). Yet Mbembe (1992) convincingly showed how deeply itaffected the relations between political elites and les masses populaires. Elsewhere(Geschiere 1997), I tried to show that it created a political atmosphere that was highlyconducive to witchcraft rumours: it was often hard to distinguish stories about secretmachinations within the one-party-top and political confrontationsbehind closeddoors, from the popular rumours about nightly confrontations between the witches. 4 There was (and is) a striking difference between the dry and authoritarian tone ofState officials and the long, dramatic shows of eloquence of local leaders in thevillage palavers (see Geschiere 1982).Development and paranoia in Cameroon 243"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"5 This is a good example of the ambiguity of witchcraft discourse. The sous-préfet’sremark that he could ‘see’ the witches was certainly interpreted by the villagers as anallusion that he, too, had acquired a ‘second pair of eyes’ – which in this part ofAfrica, as in many others, is seen as the first and indispensable phase in one’s initiationinto witchcraft. The Maka say that someone who sees witchcraft everywhere is like theowl: he is the first to leave for the witches’ nightly meetings. In practice this meansthat it is very difficult to talk about witchcraft without being implicated in it oneself. 6 Cf. the contrast implied by Warnier, in his magnificent study on L’Esprit d’entrepriseau Cameroun (1993), between the levelling impact of kinship in the Cameroonianforest societies and the stratégies de désaccumulation, permitted by the kinship normsamong the Bamileke of West Cameroon (from whose ranks an enterprising economicbourgeoisie emerged since the end of the colonial period).7 The emphasis here, of course, is on egalitarian ideology; in practice these societieswere (and are) certainly not egalitarian; indeed, there are marked inequalitiesbetween elders and young men, and even more between men and women. However,there is a strong emphasis on the basic equality of adult men that time and againserves to bring down all-too-ambitious leaders (Geschiere 1982).8Nganga(singular and plural) can be both men and women.9 See Geschiere 1997: 209–210, where I tried to show that the basic ambiguity ofwitchcraft discourse always turns such attempts at compartmentalization into a fairlyprecarious struggle. This ambiguity gives witchcraft discourse a subversive quality: itscapacity to dilute and confuse each and every apparently clear-cut opposition makesit the despair of anyone who tries to control or at least to systematize it (includingthe academic observer). In view of some criticisms on my book on this point (e.g.Toulabor 2000), it might be worthwhile trying to clarify the point I am trying tomake on these pages. It certainly seems that Maka or Beti discourse on ‘witchcraft’(djambe/evu) is extremely fluid, covering an array of images, both extremely negativeand rather positive ones; other societies seem to go to greater lengths to distinguish(‘compartmentalize’) more morally acceptable and less acceptable manifestationsof occult forces. However, it seems that such distinctions are always under heavypressure and subject to constant re-interpretations. I think it is important to emphasizethis, since many anthropologists and social scientists tended (and tend) to take suchnormative oppositions as givens, rather than asking howsuch normative distinctionsare maintained in practice in the slippery domain of the occult and howsuchdistinctions are reproduced in the face of constant change. The ambiguity of witch-craft categories – their poly-interpretability that may be precisely the source of theirremarkable power and resilience in the face of great changes – tends to underminesuch distinctions and make them subject to constant struggles. 10 This cure highlights a recurrent element in the gbatistories: the gbatiboys wereobsessed by things they did not (yet) have access to. Young boys normally onlyget the leftovers of the adults’ meals, hardly any meat or oil. A fixed element inthegbatiimaginary is also that it can only stay with boys who are virgins. In the1980s I recorded a case of a gbaticien,a bachelor in his fifties (indeed, quite oldcompared to the gbaticiens of the 1970s who were only teenagers) who claimedthat his gbatiallowed him to leave his body at night and sleep with any woman hewanted to; after he had had intercourse with her she would remain sterile for the restof her life. 11 This is also one of the reasons why the characterization of djambeas a ‘popular modeof political action’ – the notion is Bayart’s (1979) – is somewhat difficult to maintain(Geschiere 1988).12 In practice, however, even the colonial authorities were often less unequivocal intheir policies. For instance, there were also in those days protracted debates among244 Cyprian F. Fisiy and Peter Geschiere"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"civil servants on the issue of whether a ‘witch-doctor’ who had acted against ‘witches’really should be persecuted for manslaughter (see Fields 1982; Geschiere 1997).13 Characteristically, the only salaries that remained stable or rose were those of thepolice and the army. See Margaret Niger-Thomas (2000) for an evocative image ofwhat all this meant to people’s daily life.14 We should add that over the past few years there are some signs of economicrecovery. Official figures indicate substantial economic growth (5 per cent), thoughthis seems – even in the realm of formal figures – to be largely outdone by thecontinuing rise of poverty. For the forest part of the East, involvement of the localpopulation in the rapidly expanding exploitation of tropical hardwood seems to offera new promise for enrichment. However, compared to cash-cropping, this is a farmore adventurous road. Even though the forest law (1994) recognizes the localcommunities as important stakeholders, it is not at all clear how, in practice, theywill profit and, especially, how it can be guaranteed that the exploitation – either bylogging companies or local communities – can be ‘sustainable’. Until now, the woodeconomy rather seems to correspond to popular images of magic money-makers likethe feymen(see p. 242 and n. 16): sudden windfalls for a few clever persons and hardlyany benefits for most of the people.15 A recurrent element is also that the zombies are ‘sold’ to other employers. Hence theserious implications of expressions like ‘I’ll sell you’. Such expressions highlight thelink with the trauma of the former slave-trade (see de Rosny 1981; Shaw, Chapter 3).16 Compare the rapid emergence of the similar notion of ‘419s’ in Nigeria. 419 is thearticle in Nigerian law against various forms of fraud. Like feymen, 419s are supposedto specialize in abuse of confidence – in particular with computer tricks on a globalscale: these are the Nigerian ‘businessmen’ who reputedly empty European andAmerican bank accounts through electronic means (also Apter 1999). 17 But compare the very interesting research by Dominique Malaquais (2001) andBasile Ndjio (2000).18 See Comaroff and Comaroff (2000) on ‘occult economies’; Meyer and Pels (forth-coming) on ‘magic and modernity’; Geschiere (forthcoming) on ‘witch-doctors andspin-doctors’.BibliographyApter, A.
