A CAMP ALTAR IN KALDIA HAVING sketched what we may call the five unwritten Faith-ideas of early man —which, though possessing no regularly defined Bibles, no Sacred Scriptures, were never, as far back as we can see, without rituals and literature of their own—we shall now pursue the more defined and easier, though still difficult task, of tracing religious development in one of the earliest cradles of the race in western Asia, the home of those great peoples who grew to a considerable maturity all along the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris. In taking them up first in the order of nations, I do not wish to imply that we have amongst them the earliest and profoundest development of man and his religion, for I do not think we have; but Europe has been accustomed to associate Kaldia with primeval man, and the question here matters little, as we have not any positive, though a good deal of circumstantial evidence, for disputing Babylonian priority. This will appear more clearly in Chapter VIII. We have here, then, to endeavour to trace up from the very earliest times not only the history and faiths of one of the most important sections of our race, but we must be content to do this from faint and disconnected records, as yet only commentated and explained to us by those who do not seem to be conversant with the lore and gross Faiths we have been depicting, or who think these mere excrescences and impurities not worth in-vestigating. We have also in this chapter to lead the reader step by step towards the first western Book-faith of man, that first of Eastern no less than Western heresies, and one which culminated in the development of a splendid religion—Zoroastrianism, to which Europe owes most of its early cosmogony, and nearly all its faith. In every clime and age the story of religious development has been the same, and if we carefully study the workings of the human mind from the plains of Kaldia to the mountains of Asyria, Syria, and Media, and away into Parthia, Bactria, and High Asia, we shall find no more deviation in mental laws, which the great and in- "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 2comprehensible Ruler of the Universe has framed, than in the eternal and immutable ones governing the world of matter. From rude fetishes which enslaved the early nomad, man passed to the worship of the wondrous mysteries of nature’s generative agencies—and then, lifting up his eyes to Heaven, he bowed before the circling orbs which brought him in their season, health and happiness, abundance of fruit and seeds, fertility to his flocks and herds and to the varied inhabitants of the waters. By-and-bye he gave names to the recurring stars and constellations which seemed to denote and preside over certain good and evil influences, and called the creative organs which Sun and Moon, Fire and Water, seemed to use in causing fertility, the symbols of, nay, the very gods of creation. The lovely Tree seemed the result of the union of Ge and Ouranos; the seed sprang from Zervan-Akeran, “The Ancient One,” or “Boundless Time”; it pierced the earth, and in doing so, sprang into a thing of beauty, which blossomed and seeded again and again as inspired by Salacia, and fed by fertile Varooni, the Queen of Heaven, of Love and Abundance.1 Pondering on these things the wandering nomads sought to settle on earth’s favoured spots, and to cultivate trees and such seeds and cereals as they saw were “good for food,” rather than wander for ever unclothed and unsheltered from stormy Typhon or scorching Mithras. On the Euphrates, as on the Oxus, the Ganges, and the Nile, the time had come when man resolved no longer tamely to submit to every vicissi-tude of the seasons; and mythic history opens shortly after he had built for himself great cities, around which, however, still roamed in primeval wildness those hordes who had not as yet learned to buiold, and to store for the winter the riches of their summer. The founders of Sabeanism on the Euphrates were no doubt the first great agriculturalists of Western Asia—the leaders of that civilization which Toth, Amon, and Osiris gave to Eastern Africa; but here, as elsewhere, a gross Fetishism preceded phallic faith, also of coarse and disgusting simplicity; which, however, as the races settled and took to the arts of civilization, grew into a systematised but complicated Phallo-Sabean, and Fire faith, with angels and archangels, gods and goddesses, presiding over every joy, fear, hope, and aspiration of man. It was out of this chaos that a great faith sprang, cultivating profound spiritual aspirations, and led—how far we shall probably never know—by a great leader, called by the earliest Greeks, Zoroaster, who, their most learned ones asserted, lived about nine thousand three hundred years B.C.2 This religious leader, though he was the first, and existed in the darkest and least historical ages of the race, seems to have had views as lofty and pure as those of even the latest of the prophets of earth. We must begin our sketch of the early Faiths of Western Asia at a period long prior to that when the faith of Zaradusht was dominant in this part of the world, although I feel confident that there existed in central Asia and Bactria a kind of 1 See the Tree-Idea, page 73, and Ceres and Juno, page 368 of Vol. I. 2 Plato puts Zoroaster’s birth as 9000 years before his time. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 3Zoroastrianism, when we first get cognizance of the great cities of Mesopotamia. It is now generally acknowledged that before the Kaldians, whose history we can scarcely yet investigate, there existed a great Aithiopic, Phallic and Serpent-wor-shipping race, embracing peoples variously termed Kuths or Cusites, Skuthi, Kuklopians, Kabiri, &c., with a considerable civilization, who were some three thousand years or so B.C. pushing westwards to teach Egypt and Europe, as they had taught some parts of Asia, to build and trade; they were called giants, valiant and bold men, and must have attained a very advanced state, probably 5000 to 6000 years B.C. It may have been from amongst them that an heretical Zoroaster sprang some thousands of years before our era (like most prophets, not valued or much known till long after his death), at any rate, we seem to owe more to this race and sect than we are ever likely to ascertain. It seems clear that the first settlers came from the north, and were called Aithe-Opes, from Ath or Ait, and Ops, here worshipped as the Sun and Serpent. Herodotus rightly says that the Asiatic Aithiopians had not frizzled hair like the negroes of the Nile, and many things point to a great Athi or Ardi people having been the parents of even ancient Burburs or Akads—those who changed the name of the Moon city of UR to Kaldia, as signifying this in the language of their Armenian or Colchian highlands, for such is said to have been the Akadian cradle-land. Berosus tells us of Medes—perhaps the Urada or Ala-rodians of whom Herodotus speaks—descending from here about 2458 B.C., and driving all the dwellers off the alluvial portions of Mesopotamia; so these were clearly opposed to the ancient Kooths, whom Jews said were the descendents of Am or Ham, and whose brothers were Mizraim and Phut, by which is usually understood Egyptian and Ethiopian Africa. Theose Burburs or Akads who erected UR would probably be Turanians, that is, Ta-Ur-ians or Tot-Aur-ians, and therefore as we shall presently see more purely Phallic worshippers than the later Aryans. The Armenian geographers, says Mr. Geo. Rawlinson, apply the name Cush (Koosh, or Kooth) and Ethipia to all the region from the Indus to the Tigris; the Greeks called all east of the Tigris, Kisia, Kosia, or Elam, and we still name many parts here Koos-is-tan, or Kooth-stan. The name of the enormous alluvial tracts in the eastern delta of the Indus adjoining Gujerat (Kuth-erat) now known to us at Kutch, Cutch or Kooch, may come from the same stock. Mr Rawlinson thinks that the ancient Aithiopians and Kaldians were of the same stock. Hesiod and Pindar say that Mem-non was a king of Aithiopia; he was the son of a Sisian woman, says Eskylus, and the founder of Soosa and Elam, from whence sprang the first Hellenism—Kaldian Sun-Worship.1 He led Soosians and Aithopians to assist his father’s brother at Troy, and the Egyptians say he was their king Amen-ophis III.—the “vocal Memnon.” He had palaces or Memnonia in Egypt and Soosians, and a tribe in the very ancient land 1 That Greek Hellenism was but the Ellamism of Kaldia and Media, Bryant, III. 153, et seq, makes clear. Greek scholars not being also scholars of Faiths and of Kaldian history, have heretofore thought that only Greeks were Hellenists, but now we are told there never was a Greek Hellen! See Rev. A.H.

There is a Sen-ar or Shem-Ar on the Nile close to Meroe, as the Jew said there was one close to Soosa, and Meroe says it gave priests to Egypt, that its people came from India; it often gave kings to Egypt.

Hitherto the old Jewish writings have kept us in bondage, for we have been taught from youth to age to consider these as history sent direct from heaven, regarding which all further research or enquiry is both unnecessary and impious; these views no longer impede research. The last quarter of a century has consequently yielded a perfect harvest of historical and religious matter, and in regard to general history we may reasonably hope that we are yet only in the first chapter of a most voluminous work; yet I suspect that in the matter of the Cults of Babylonia, there are no more very important revelations awaiting those who have thoroughly mastered the practical working of Eastern Faiths, for these are intensely conservative. It will be seen as we proceed in our description of the Gods, rites, and ceremonies of all the peoples in the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris, that Kaldia of even the 30th century B.C. had precisely the same religion as Babylon of Nebukadnezar’s day. Of course we hope yet to obtain a vast number of facts and most interesting matter exhibiting the detailed working of the Faiths and the movement of the religious minds of the peoples; and this, combined with their correct ethnological, political, and geographical history, will unfold a rich field; but as the gods and their characters are now clear to us, so is their whole faith. TOPOGRAPHY.—Kaldia may be considered as composed of two provinces, em-bracing the Delta and alluvial protions—some five hundred miles in length from the Persian Gulf to Hit or Is. The lower province embraced only the Delta, and had for its capital Ur, Hur, Har or Hoor on the right bank of the Euphrates. The other province—Kaldia Upper or Proper, the capital of which was Babel or Babylon—extended up to "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 5Hit or Is on the Euphrates, and to Samara on the Tigris. The two together may be called the Kingdom of Kaldia, bounded by the Arabian deserts on the south, and the Mountains of Elam or Soosiana on the north. The Persian Gulf no doubt extended at one time close to the great capital of Lower Kaldia which probably rose, like Calcutta, from a fishing village to be a trading depôt, and then one of the first capitals on earth. Its previous inhabitants were clearly Ur-ians—perhaps Ta-Urians or Turanians, from the north, who, after a long residence near Arabia, would soon show an admixture of Shemitic blood. It is usual to say that in the 25th century B.C. they yielded to an Aryan influx from Central Asia, or to highlanders from the lofty mountains on the north, called afterwards Media and Armenia, and that the new comers in turn yielded to Shemitic Arabs, who have for three thousand seven hundred years disputed with all comers, and successfully, the dominance of the rich northern border-lands of their Arabian Cradle. The actual displacers of the first Urites, were clearly tribes of Am-ites, Am-Onians, or Kooths under the designation of Burburs or Akads, who translating into their own language UR—“the city” of the Moon or Light—called it Kusdim, Kuthim, or Kaldia,1 and it was under these Kuthim that Lower and Upper Kaldia rose into one kingdom and became a great empire; many must have remained owing allegiance to Ur and been called Urians even in the days of the Jewish captivity,2 and we have inscriptions of the 9th century B.C. giving us facts regarding them. The general movements of the race seem always to have been, just as in India and China, from the Delta towards the north-west—that is to the higher lands of their loved and no doubt sacred rivers. It was on the decline of the Babylonian power that we find in the north-west a settlement of a more stalwart race, doubtless due to a more invi-gorating and temperate climate; these finally grouped themselves about the beautifully forked valleys formed by the Tigris and the great Zab, and at the apex of this triangle they founded their first great capital, Asher, which gives to the whole land the name of Asyria,3 and which my readers will recognise as called after the great Father Deity A-eshwar, or Maha-Deva. Inside this triangle was a host of glorious cities, beginning with Kala or Nimrood and Nineveh, and ending with Sargon’s capital of the 8th century B.C. In the north, on the sculptured rocks of Bāvian, we see remnants of this people’s faith, and scraps of history. On the right flank lay Arbel, or Ar-ba-il, la orba, said to be called after the four-fold phallic deity—a site where Zoroastrian supremacy awaited and found its doom, some two thousand years after the time we are consider-ing. Guarding this centre of Asyrian wealth and civilisation from the restless, bold, and valiant hosts of that great sandy continent to the south, lay the long range of the Senjar Mountains, garrisoned no doubt from Kala, Nineveh, and Sargon, and not without need; for in spite of every precaution, year after year, and century after century, Arabs continued to surge up on all dwellers in the great cities of Asyria and 1 Rawlinson’s Anc. Mon. I. 71. Gen. xi. 31. 2 If U = A, then Urian = Arian, and A = L. K is often only a euphonic addition, as we shall see hereafter, so Ur may be Kur, whence Kurios. 3 The land of Asher, Aser, Astria, must not be confounded with Syria, Tsyria, or Sooyra, for rea-sons already given.

PERSEPOLIS or ISTAKR is said by some to have been founded 4600 years ago, or 2730 B.C. It was full of riches in the days of Cyrus, and was burned to the ground, some say, by Alexander the Great in a wild revel, 331 B.C. Many aver that it was only a royal burial-place with some country palaces, as neither Herodotus nor Ctesias speaks of it, and it was only after Alexander’s time that writers begin to mention its greatness. It lies in the well-watered vale of “Hollow Persia,” about thirty miles north-east of Shiraz, and forty-miles north-east of it was the Akaimenian capital PESARGADE—now Moorgāb, where the supposed tomb of Cyrus is still shown. PERSEPOLIS is famous for its “Hall of Xerxes” or Cheel Minar of forty pillars, of which only fifteen remain; they were about twenty feet high, masterpieces of masonry, fluted, and with heavy capitals. Here also are various small buildings said to have been temples, all Kuklopian in structure and with highly-polished black-marble doors and window-frames. Persepolis was the capital of Darius, Hystaspes and Xerxes, 520 to about 420 B.C., and remained the Akaimenian capital, though these Kings occa-sionally resided at Soosa. Many entrance-gates of the buildings are ornamented with bas-reliefs representing a full-sized man seizing a goat by its horns and stabbing it, the goat having one foot on the man’s chest, and the other on his right arm. The goat is thought to be Alexander the Great, and some writers say that owing to this sculp-ture the conqueror destroyed Persepolis. PESARGADE, Persargadæ, or Pasargade was the capital of Cyrus and his son Cam-byses, and therefore the first city of the Akaimenian monarches—560 to 522 B.C. It is called after Perseus the Son of Helios by Persi, daughter of Oceanus the Kuthite and Titan, and was the seat of the oldest Persian tribe—the Pasargadæ. There are only two remnants of the city left, a platform of handsomely worked stone-masonry, some 250 by 260 feet, on the side of a hill overlooking the plain, whilst on the plain, as was the case at Shinar, is one pillar like an Indian Lāt having neither capital nor base; but here also exist the foundations of large buildings, possibly palaces and temples. Arrian and Strabo tell us that there was here a structural tomb, like a child’s Noah’s ark on a high platform, and surrounded at a great distance by the remains of columns; and that this once contained in a golden coffin the body of Cyrus, consigned here after its recovery in 529 B.C. from the Skythic Masa-getæ. An ark on a hill, pillars round it, a golden coffin, and the fact related by Herodotus as to Skuths and Persi worshipping the Sun, and the very name of Cyrus or Kur-us, are all signficiant, especially as Herodotus says that Persians “sacrificed the swiftests of all animals to the swiftest of all the gods.” It is more reasonable to suppose that the so-called tomb was a temple to the Kurios or Belus, as it is undoubtedly in character like other solar temples at Birs Nimrood, and the arks on all hills, the temple of Minerva on the Akropolis, the Caput on the Capitoline, etc. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 8At Persepolis there are now only the skeletons of the buildings—the strongest stone masonry, all the masses of brick or wood-work having gone for ever. The great platform overlooked from here the plain of Beudamir containing the leading public buildings, doubtless also the dwellings of the Kings, but the latter have disappeared, being of less durable materials. On the platform is still the Palace of Xerxes and some smaller buildings, no doubt erected by Xerxes and his father Darius.1 Not far from the town, at a place called Nakshi Roostam, are tombs and temples, and especially noticable is the Tomb of Darius. From it was can discover the probably style of the Palace, and also observe that not only the Asyrian architecture was copied, but that the faith of the Akaimenians differed but little from that of the Asyrians; for on the front of the main block stands that god Asher passing through a circle, and under-neath is the Monarch holding Venus’ bow in adoration, while opposite him is a Fire or Lingam shrine and altar, and in the upper angle, Helios himself. All drawings of what are ordinary considered “Magian Fire Temples” not only agree with the so-called Nakshi Roostam tombs and that at Pesargade, but evidently with the pre-Moslem Kibla or Al-Kaba of Meka,2 and such buildings clearly mark the old faiths of the countries where the are found. They were sacred to Black or White Stones, that is were Krishnaite or Sivaite temples, then perhaps snake shrines, and eventually became fire temples, for all these were the gods of the aborigines and the ancient tribes of Pesargade at, and previous to the time of Cyrus. No doubt, as Rawlinson says,3 they were open-air worshippers to a great extent, and Nakshi Roos-tam, the lingam shrine of Nomads. It was built, as we still often find those in India, with a high entrance or a temporary walled-up door to prevent the ingress of cattle, etc., for the door of the Al-Kaba, like the doors of the Irish towers, and the so-called “tomb of Cyrus,” is high up in the wall, requiring steps or a ladder to enter by. Many of the rocks of the Valley of Pesargade were sacred, and often sculptured to a great height. It is thought that the Medes, as dwelling near the wooded parts of the Zagros mountains, first introduced the columnar buildings, the prevailing feature of the Akai-menian architecture, and which they reared in the most exquisite taste in stone. Mr. Fergusson thinks this was probably the source whence Greece got her Ionic columns; she doubtless got much else from Asia; even her Doric architecture, though coming from Egypt, was there second-hand from Asia. No reader can fail to perceive that the faiths of Babylonia during the various stages of its civilisation differed in no important particular from those of all other lands in the same greade of progress. Hoor, the fishing village, and Hoor, the capital of lower Kaldia, had alike their “Moon God,” but the one was probably a red daub or crescent on a rude stone or baked mound, while the other was represented by a magnificent 1 Rawlinson’s Anc.

We are still excavating among these to try and discover their treasures, and time may unfold further details, but I think the great facts are established, for we can now read all such religious riddles in Indian temples and palaces. No one who knows and has studied the valleys and faiths of the Ganges, can be at all puzzled with those of the Tigris and Euphrates, and their well marked similarities. Our memory recalls many an Ur in lower Bengal, hid amid the marshy banks and alluvial creeks of the great Ganges, full of Phallic and Sabean faiths, which may rise to be an Erek or Siparvaim, as Calcutta has risen to be a Babylon; but here our northern Aryans have driven out the original Turanians, and not as in Kaldia, succumbed to Shemitic hordes. TABLES.—It is impossible to understand the progress of Faiths unless we grasp the historic growth, if not the geography of the nations which gave birth to, or yielded obedience to them. I have therefore prepared, after great labour—for history is not made to our hand here—a somewhat elaborate synchronological table extending over two thousand years, of the leading events in the western monarchies from B.C. 2500 to 250, in hopes of helping my readers in a thorough investigation of the subject. Great attention must be given to the nomenclature of the gods, kings, and temples, no less that to the rise and fall of nations, for names in this lore are far more important things even than dates; neither chronologists, kings, nor peoples can change these, and most names of great nations, kings, and faiths are derivable from those gods or hallowed emblems which the masses hold most sacred. The root, sign, or symbol of an old and holy name can rarely be discovered by mere philological enquiry; to do this, we must study not only the Faiths but the actual emblems, for these were alike the gods of Turanians, Aryans, and Shemites, because these were men and women in a like stage of culture. A word more as to this before we enter upon the Tables, abounding as these do with names. I have for years felt the truth of what Niebuhr long since proclaimed, and have in this work endeavoured in a careful manner to carry out in some respects the views and ideas of the great historian. “Unless,” he wrote, “a boldness of divination, liable as it is to abuse, be permitted, all the searches into the earlier history of nations must be abandoned;” and I have therefore found it necessary to insist that we must not be too much tied down to the received modes which our pastors and masters, nay, which great philologists have laid down for acceptance in the matter of the origin of the words which continually meet us in the Bibles, rites and ceremonies of Faiths. The rules of language are no doubt immutable, if we only per-fectly knew these; those we do know are excellent and sound in their way, and few of them, indeed, can be set aside, and none may we lightly pass over even in this our difficult and somewhat exceptional journey, but there are paths here, as in the life of each of us, when we must step aside—of course at our peril—from the advice of most if not all around us, and march boldly as our own spirit guides. To get at the roots of Faiths, we must go beyond even the ken of philology where this concerns itself only with the roots of words, and seek in the signs and symbols themselves, the ideas which "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 10gave rise to the leading objects of Faiths being so represented, and this necessitates at least temporary departure from the laws which rule regularly formed language. The learned writer of Dates and Data1 says: “The many varieties of written characters employed by manking have been derived from rude pictorial representations of objects; . . . . . and every form of linguistic expression, if at all abstract or signifying the results of complex contrivance or thought, has been constructed of syllables or words, originally intended to convey only the most concrete and simple ideas.” Thus then, words com-pounded or connected with Solar and Fire phenomena, as DEVA, TAU, TOT, ADAM, and such like, must be investigated down to the first “rude pictorical representation of objects,” and not merely to the syllables, as De, Ta, To, Ad, &c. Bishop Colenso points out that the word UBOMI is now used in the Zooloo language to imply the highest perfection of excellence, and in that sense is applied to the Deity, and yet literally signifies “Meat more than half putrid and alive with maggots!” so to analyse UB-omi, as we might do through the roots Ab and Om, &c., would yield no result such as we here care for; but to investigate why it is a maggot and “Flesh,” and why the Logos or WORD was also Sarx or Flesh, and this the Hebrew Basar of the Old Testament, which was circumcised, would of course lead to very important results,2 which my readers can think out for themselves. The author of Dates and Data writes that “it is a mere waste of time to attempt, as is so frequently done, to define ‘religion’ and ‘superstition’ by reference to the primary meaning of the Latin words from which those terms are derived.” Greek derivations he thinks of some avail, but “non-Latin languages, perhaps without exception, make no show of distinguishing religion from superstition.” This is the true way to get at “the vague expressions and unwarranted speculations of untutored men, which form the bases of all superstitions, whether exist- ing in their original baldness among savages, and in the nurseries and lower ranks of cultured society, or among educated people, wrapped up in the traditional verbiage and sterile conventionalisms which still pervade the teaching of our schools and colleges.” Thus Ad, which Latins so largely compound as a mere preposition or adjunct, may be AL, AR, or AM, for all these consonants interchange, and as M was represented as the ripple of water, ~~~~~~~, and is water or woman and the furrowed field, so A is the Cone, and the universal letter in the earliest alphabet—the Cone-iform, or, as I spell this, the Cuniform; but it is also the ploughshare, or that which stirs up Terra to fertility, and the ploughshare in the Lingam, and Sign of RAM whose wife was Sita, “the field furrow” or Sulcus, as already noticed at page 33, Vol. I., and to be else-where discussed. It is from this AR, and not as ploughers, that races were called AR-yans, regarding which much will appear further on. Readers of this chapter should specially bear in mind the following words, some of which are commented on in Dates and Data already referred to. 1 Op. Cit., part I, p. 21.

BOORBOORS, perhaps Aryans, descend upon OORIANS, and call Oor or Hur, KALDIA. Asyrians from Central Asia desecend upon India. Tablets speak of “Kings of four races,” or tongues, moving about; probably KOOSHITES, TURANIANS, ARYANS, and SHE-MITES. (Anct. Mon. I. 69, &c.)—the latter improbable. Elamites, or El-An-ites overrun Babylonia, and hold it for 200 years. Establishment of KOOTHITE KINGDOMS in lower Kaldia, with Turanian and Shemitic blood according to Anct. Mon. I. 8, but this last can only mean Ancient Arabians. King of Elam—KUDUR-Nanundi carries away image of Nana, goddess of Erek, and ravages whole country. Some contend for the year 2286, or first year of BELUS (Syncellus). ZOROASTER at this or some previous date (Berosus). IZDUBAR or NIMROD slays Humbaba, King of Elam, and re-establishes Kaldian Kingdom. Babylon already built; and before this, Median Kings ruled in Kaldia (Berosus). Regular Register of STELLAR OBSERVATIONS up to this date obtained by Alexander Magnus. First MEDIAN DYNASTY ends, having lasted 224 years (Berosus), or from 2209 to 1985 B.C. (Palmer). NIMROD, son of Koosh, say Jews, rules in Kaldia, and BEL-NIMROD, alias BILOO-NIPROO is worshipped as a God. Eleven Kaldi Kings rule till 1976, being First KALDIAN DYNASTY. SEMIRAMIS thought to rule, probably a Queen called Devi-Ram, or Swami-Ram. Ctesias’ List of Kings goes back thus far. Tablets mention as Kingdoms in connection with Kootha and AKAD, SURARTU, MARTU of SYRIA, Gutin or Goim, Elam, Assam, Lullubu, Lutu, Kassi (Benares?), Kissati, Nituk or Asmun, Sumir, &c.

Rawlinson gives us from 910 to 640 B.C. These two harmonise, and give a tolerably correct Asyrian chronology from about the close of the Empire to 10th century B.C. In my Synchronological tables here, I have shown a great deal of the data which M. Layard, with the two Rawlinsons and other investiga-tors, have so laboriously worked out, though we must not yet assume that all is quite correct. There are great prejudices to be overcome, especially in the orthodox mind, and these seriously interfere with the acceptance of all dates thought to clash with so-called “Bible History.” Thus, Mr. George Rawlinson will having nothing to say to Manetho, Ctesias, or even Berosus, where these authors do not chime with certain forgone conclusions as to the Jewish writings, though occasionally he rejects them for reasons very much sounder, though not, I think, sound enough. On the other hand, the slightest corroboration from the unknown writers of even such fragmentary books as Jonah and the Pentateuch are sufficient to clench any arguments against tablets and sculptures. He guides us sceptically and wisely in the history of both Babylon and Asyria where nothing militates against writings of the Jews—the poor slaves of these great nations, and even admits some unorthodox but very wise doubts as to the centuries when an Abraham and Moses flourished, but scorns the idea that Berosus’ early kings could have lived a hundred years and more, though he accepts the absurdities of Jew-ish writings which state that the lives of many men extended over several hundred years. On these Mosaic years, also, hang all so-called biblical data and pseudo-history. Nor can I agree with our historian as to the following, for the meagre facts yet before us regarding Indian and Chinese history do not permit of our speaking so strongly in re-gard to Kaldian Archeology. “Less ancient,” he says, “than the Egyptian, it claims the priority over every empire or kingdom, which has grown up in the soil of Asia. The Aryan, Turanian, and even the Shemitic tribes appear to have been in the nomadic condition when the Koothite settlers in lower Babylonia betook themselves to agriculture, erected temples, built cities, and established a strong and ethical Government. The leaven which was to spread by degrees through the Asiatic peoples was first deposited on the shores of the Persian gulf; . . . hence civilisation, science, letters, and art extended themselves northwards, eastward and westward. Asyria, Media, Shemitic Babylonia, Persia, as they derived from Kaldia the character of their writing, so they were indebted to the same country for their general notions of government and administration, for their architecture, their decorative art, and still more for their science and literature . . . Kaldia stands forth as the great parent, and original inventress of Asiatic civilization, without any rival that can reasonably dispute her claims.” Now with profound deference to historians like Mr. George Rawlinson and all who follow him, and who assume, if I understand them aright, that Babylonian history and civilization are the oldest in the world, I would urge "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 27that we are all still very much in the dark as regards both Kaldian and Egyptian his-tory, that we know far less of Indian than either, and that nothing whatever is known respecting the cradle of the Aryan race, and very little of the Chinese or Dravidians of Southern Hindostan. It is but seventy years since Grotefend discovered a key to the reading of the cuni-form languages of Babylon and Asyria, while the great libraries of the latter still lie un-read, and are to the world unreadable. There are two if not more languages written in cuniform, that of ancient Kaldia—probably Turanian—and that of Babylonia and Asyria —Shemitic tongues, and following these the cuniform of the so-called Persian rock inscrip-tions, which some say is an Aryan language, and posterior to the Zend of the Zend-Avesta. We have now (1874) many good scholars of the cuniform, and Dr. Birch ever and again issues sundry translations from it, in small volumes, entitled Records of the Past, though under the sanction of a Society of Biblical Archeology—a sectarian name, which might prejudice a number of readers against them, but so far as I have seen needlessly.1 Records of the Past are wisely confined to mere translations of the cuniform, and give us all but unalloyed, sound matter. I say “all but,” for we lately observed that in translating Cols. III. and IV. of the Izdubar legends, Mr. Smith suppressed matter, because in his opinion it was hardly adapted for general reading. Truth is too precious, and our soucrces of history far too scanty, to allow of our suppressing anything; and these grosser parts of records often give the key to the whole. Thus, had the real meaning of Bible names from Aleim to the later Jahvh, and from Adam and Eve to Messiah and Peter, been made clear to us, and no figures or cult been hid from the masses, we should have been saved centuries of idle “Readings” and “Commentaries,” and been aware many years ago of what only a very few yet know anything about. We should not now have our cuniform and eastern scholars ever and again horrifying those attached to Biblical stories, by suggestions that these came from “Pagan” nations who gave gods and languages to the Jewish tribes, and who had a vat and enduring civilization long before the biblical cosmogony, as well as a regularly flowing history, which had never been inter-rupted by any such cataclysms as Jews imagined real; for those from whom Jews bor-rowed probably only aimed at showing in the form of such allegories, the ebbing and flowing of faiths, or of new mental impulses; this at least is the mode in which we find enlightened and liberal Christians trying to gloss over the strongly stated “facts” and details of the Pentateuch. None of us are yet prepared to say which was the oldest nation or language of man, and probably never will be. When we first hear of Babylon, we find there were there races call Aithiopes, Soomirs, Akads, &c., called variously Turanians, Aryans, and latterly Shemites; but the whole country was dotted with names be-longing to all these groups of languages. Turanians called “Sumir” Kame or Ke-engi, and Akad, “Urdu” or Oor-doo; but the Shemitic race and tongue 1 Records of the Past, being Eng. trans. of the Assyr. and Egyp. Mons.

King Sargon, of 708 B.C., wrote that: “from the remote days or UR to the Kings, my fathers, of Asyria and Kar-dooniyas” (Babylon), there were three hundred and fifty kings,1 which would put back the ancient kingdoms to 9100 years B.C. according to the lengths of the reigns of the Asyrian sovereigns we do know of, between 1850 and 607 B.C.;2 the translator thinks this god-king Ur was the first mythical King of Berosus—Al-Orus, probably Al-Or, or God-Oor—the moon. This tablet state-ment by Sargon enables us to apply a test to the “years” of Berosus, which are clearly not years when tried by the number of his kings. In all, he gives us, as below,3 two hundred and eighteen kings before Pul and Senakerib of the 7th or 8th century B.C., which, and twenty-four years each, takes us back to (5232 + 700) = 5932 years, and we are therefore perhaps justified in accepting the priest with his detailed history of two hundred and eighteen kings, as recorded in unmutilated tablets to which he had access, in preference to the round, grandiose statement of a monarch, who boastfully avers that he is one of a race of three hundred and fifty kings. Now, 5932 to 6000 B.C., or there-about, agrees tolerably with a great deal of important assertion made by many learned old writers, as to the early settlement of mankind as agriculturalists; see Chart. The figures are not disputed in the writings of Aristotle, Pliny, “The Septuagint,” Syncellus, Manetho, Dufeu, Drummond, Phillips, Dr. Lightfoot, &c., so we must give Berosus his fitting place in the list of old historians, accept his kings, and hold him blameless for the notation which may be Turanian, at least on a basis we do not yet understand. We know very little yet of any Western Turanians, their works, words, or ways, and there is here a wide field open to research into which many are now seriously entering. Languages, too, are changing sides; Cyprian, or rather Kuprian, we first thought was Turanian, but as now deciphered it is found to be Aryan; Akadian and Soomerian we fancied were languages of a complex syllabary which finds a modern parallel in Japanese, but now we learn that they are two dis- tinct tongues, and M. Jules Oppert says we have a specimen of the last— 1 Records of the Past [first series, vol. iii], p. 4 (Smith). 2 52 Kings reigned from 1850 to 607 B.C., see my Tables, and the list given in p. 1 of Smith’s Assyria. 521243 = 23.9 years, or say 24 × 350 = 8400, to which, adding Sargon’s time, 700 years = 9100 years. 3 CHRONOLOGICAL SCHEME OF BEROSUS, GIVEN IN GEO.SMITH’S ART., VOL.

These inquiries into ancient history, which the Jew thought he had ages ago settled, have been long watched with anxiety, if not horror, by many good biblicists; even the President of the Biblical Archeological Society, though ever and again comforting and pacifying, alarms one at times by such remarks as: “It cannot be concealed that the chronologies of the Jews and the Assyrians, as they at present stand, do not harmonise —there is a want of synchronism. It is not possible to decide at present where the error lies, (!) but nothing save an act of violence, such as the alteration of text, or the forced hypothesis of an omission of years in the Assyrian canons, can at present reduce them to a common level. (!)”1 Even those European classical writers who erroneously give to the Greek language and civilization an Egyptian origin, cannot avoid showing us that the Greeks attributed their genius, impetus, and intellectual advancement to Eastern life and thought emanating from Koothite Kaldia. Most Grecian myths—in which we have yet to discover much history, came direct from the East with those races whom Greeks supplanted, and so also did Hellenic faith spring from Kaldian, Ionim, and Ellenes. This particularly strikes men who have carefully studied India and her still dark history. A learned writer on Northern Antiquities thus indulges in a flood of eloquence in support of the Eat being the cradle of mankind.2 “When we strive to pierce the gloom that shrouds an infant world, it is the heaven-aspiring peaks of Central Asia (see side note) that we first discern, illumined by those primeval myths, which, like the dazzling corruscations of a polar winter, play fantastically amidst the night of ages, ere history’s dawn has yet streaked time’s hoary horizon with its earliest ray. When at length the opening morn disples these visionary splendours, we behold the luxuriant plains of the Ganges already occupied by an intelligent people, with its sages and philosophers attempting, by rendering matter the shadowly phenomenal of mind, to idealize the metempsy-chosis of nature into an eternal self-emanating and self-absorbing unity.” This philosophy and age the writer speaks of elsewhere as “at least forty centuries old,” and none will object to this who acknowledge the orthodox age of the events related in the Mosaic Genesis, which, according to the churches, places the birth of Noah in the middle of the thirtieth century B.C., and says that “Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh” were the cities of his grandsons.3 The old city of “Accad” (which we should perhaps spell Ark-ad, as signifying the Ark of Al or Ad—the sun) signifies, according to Cruden, “a vessel,” that is the Ark. In Koothite tongues, we are told it meant “the City of the Sun,” and in old Irish, Achadh is a “field,” which is symbolical of woman and Isis. The Septuagint writes 1 Dr. Birch, as reported at Oriental Congress of 1874. 2 Bohn’s Ant. Lib., p. 43. 3 Gen x. 10. N.B. —Himalaya signifies, he says, heavenly Mountains. Sanskrit —Himala.

Ak-Or, Achor, or Ach-Ur was the name under which “the Sun was worshipped by the Ethiopians or Cuthites, as well as by the Egyptians; and they esteemed him the Theos Apomuios.”2 Ak-or-ana is Akor-ain, “the great fount of light,” in which Or = On = Sun. So the sacred city of the Palaistini, which is in the Old Testament translated “Ekron,”3 should be Ak-Ar-on, as in the LXX. The learned Bryant says Kadmus is only amplified in “Achad-ham, rendered by Greeks Acadamus, Academus, and contracted to Cadmus; hence Academia,” the place of learning. The countries around the Persian Gulf have always been looked upon as the cradle of the great Phenician people, and Jews, perhaps to magnify their race, said that Abra-ham sprang from the ancient capital of the Ur-Kaadim, now Mugheir; they relate that he tarried at Haram, or “on the Road” in the language of Akadians. PHENICIAN ABRAM.—The Pheneicians have always had Gods called Elohim or Aleim, a cosmogeny such as is related in Genesis, and tales regarding a great patriarch sacrificing or proposing to sacrifice his Son. Some hold that the Armenian highlands around Ar-a-rat or Ala-lat at the sources of the Ar-As or Araxes, as well as the sacred waters of the Euphrates and the Tigris, were the early home of all Ar, Al, El, or Elohim worshippers; and from these districts came the early Boorboors, who first occupied Oor or Kaldia, but not the Shem-ites, Jah-ites, or Jehovists. Rocks and tablets, written in characters long anterior to the date of Jewish writings, give us details of the Phenician patriarch-god offering up his eldest son Ye(d)ud, or “the beloved,” as a sacrifice, on a “high place,” to appease the father-god in a time of war and pestilence; and this the ancient literature of Babylon calls, says the Rev. Mr. Sayce, “a holocaust offered up on a high place on the first month of the Akadian year as ‘the sacrifice of Bel,’ or ‘of Righteousness’ (‘Sun of Righteousness’), symbolised by a Ram as one of the zodiacal signs.” “The Phenician story” states that this was “the sacrifice of the eldest born by way of ‘first fruits,’ at the beginning of the year,” now continued by the churches as the sacrifice of Jehovah’s “first begotten son.” Kaldian inscriptions also give us legends connected with two stones; sundry very curious sacrifices; destruction of a bull or bull-calf; a bull man; cures by serpents; a flood, &c., which, although all very different to what Ezra in far later years told his tribes, yet clearly could furnish a nucleus for these tales. The Phenician Usous invented clothes, fire, boats, and the worship “at Tyre of two rude stones or pillars TO THE FIRE AND WIND, worshipping (sic) and pouring out to them the blood of such wild beasts as had been caught in hunting;” now the Asyrian inscriptions tell us that “Usū was a name or suburb of Tyre”—pos-sibly it was an ancient name of this place—so famous for Lingam or Sun-stone, Tsoor or Soorya worship. Usous, says the Rev. Mr. Sayce, is connected with Esâu, meaning “hairy,” and if so, with Esau and Edomites, which Jews certainly were; such tribes also claimed to have sprung from Gan-Eden, which is possibly Gan-duni, the name given to Bablyon 1 Proper Names, Old Testament, p. 6.

The Tigris was then called Hidekil, Idikla, or Idikna, and Dala; and the Euphrates, Purrat, or “the Great Water,” which, in the palmy days of Kaldia, appears to have named Ar-ak-tu; but as this was an Akadian term, some think it was so named after their first known holy river, Arakses, which dis-appeared from its bed, and might thus have been thought to “compass the whole land of Cush”—their cradle. A great river is always called after the great goddess of a land, so some form of Ar-ak-tu must mean Anatoo. The Asyrian Genesis speaks of only one sacred tree—the Fire or Pine, and the deities and their attendants always car-ried the seed cones of this, as symbolical of the worship of the fertile energies. On coming south the race had of course to substitute the Palm for the Pine. I must ask a little attention to the Phenician and Akadian cosmogenies, although I fear somewhat in repetition of what appears elsewhere. The Phenician creation emanated from “A Trinity”— Ba-Au or Chaos. Spirit or Desire. Mot or Vlomos, Slime or Matter, Time and the Egg The first, Ba-Au, marries Kolpia, or Wind—the Vedic Maroots, and Greek Hera; and so from Sky and Earth (Ouranos and Ge) sprang all things.

I give a drawing of it, Fig. 1, Plate XIV.,1 in which the organs are veiled by the Phallic Cross. Wilson writes thus or the Arda-nari:2 “The supreme spirit in the act of creation became, by Voya, two-fold; the right side was the male, the left was Prakriti. She is of one form with Brahma. She is Maya, eternal and imperish-able; such as the Spirit, such is the inherent energy (Sakti), as the faculty of burning is inherent in fire.” In her right or male arm is a serpent and triad, in the left or female the opened flower or seed. But we are digressing somewhat. Bryant gives us, in his third volume, an immense deal of good matter in regard to the ancient inhabitants of Western Asia and Southern Europe, and clearly had a men-tal key which later writers have missed. His authorities range over the whole field of Greek and Latin literature, including Sibyline poetry, Berosus, “Sankuniathon and Doric hymns, orginally written in Amonian or Cuthite language.” He believed the Koothites, or Babylonian Aithiopians, amalgamated with Mizraim, and Caphtorim, or Egyptians and Kopts, who, as related to their father, Ham or Am (for the learned old author receives every word of the old Jewish writings as true), hence got the name of Amonians, who were great and pure Phallic worshippers. We must carefully dis-tinguish between the very ancient peoples and the long after immigrants, known as Kymri, Kelts, &c., while at the same time we should not draw the lines too tight or become dogmatic. Bryant tells us that in classic literature we will find the “great building race” called—Giants, Titans, Kentaurs, Phenicians, Kabiri, Demons, Formians, Shepherds or “Shepherd Kings,” Makarians, Skythians or Skuthi, Indi, Iberians, Heldæ, Hyperboreans, Idæi-Daktyli, Lamiæ, Iapitiæ, and Ethiopians; but in general, Kooseans or “Cuthites,” “descendents of Chus,” or the mythic Ham. From more certain records—the Cylinders, recording events in the reigns of Esar-hadon and Asher-bani-pal, in the seventh century B.C.—we learn that certain Kymerians had invaded Asyria, where some of their chiefs were captives at the Asyrian court; and from re-marks of the same date as to the Skythian invasion of that time, it would appear that about that period the Kymri were a portion of those great Asiatic hordes residing on the borders of the Asyrian empire, and being then pushed onwards.3 We probably approach the truth, as nearly as we at present can, when we say that Koothites, Kymri, Iberians, &c., were Skyths, but that all Skyths were not Koothites, Skoothi or Kymri; and that the earliest accounts we have, correctly describe them as a great and learned race ruling not only in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, but over all Asia Minor and Southern and Northern Europe. The Kelts acknowledge such peoples to be their ancestors. Bryant, quoting Eusedibus, tells us that Skyths or Koothites, in ancient Kaldia, were called the descendants of Ion or Ionah, that is, were “Kaldaic Ionim,” Ell-Anes, and great worshippers of the moon or female principle—in fact, Yonites; and we shall be-and-bye see that from these sprang Greek Hellenism or Sun-worship. Here, as in the West, Ionim once dominated over Babelites or Linga- 1 [Copied from Inman, Anct. Faiths., ii. pl. II.] 2 Brahma Vaivarta Purana. 3 See A. Mons. II. 487, and Herodotus"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 33ites, and established an Ionian kingdom. Bryant says that all these races, “down to Serug the seventh from Noah, continued a Skythian succession,” which, according to Bible chronology, would be Enos (“seventh from Noah”); and thus the great Skythian age terminated about 3700 years B.C. Other old writers, besides Eusebius, agree as to this, and also call this period “the Cuthic Age, or Cuthismus, Kuqismoj.” It is possible that the legend regarding the Tower of Babel arose from the trial on the part of a great ruler, Chus or his sons, to bind mankind into an early empire, which they resisted and forced the projectors to fly the country. These Koothians were always represented as energetic and intelligent beyond all old races, and on this account would be most distasteful to inert and unprogressive Egyptians, who we ob-serve eventually drove out the “Cuseans or shepherd kings” from Egypt. Sometimes the race were called Indi or Sindi, and were identified with the most ancient settlers of Phenicia, where they were called Pœni, Penikes, and in Ireland Fenices, and latterly Fenians.1 Sankuniathon, who learned much concerning them from very ancient Amonian records obtained in the innermost part of a temple, says, according to Philo Byblius, that these people were great worshippers of their ancestors and writers of their own and their fathers’ doings. Bryant holds that “the Skythians ruled the world long before the Asyrian empire,” but in order not to run foul of the Jewish flood, he is obliged to put their rule after Archbishop Usher’s orthodox Noah! adding that “their empire reached into India and was that of Nimrod Belus, or Elorus,” that their faith was purely phallic, but inasmuch as the mighty Lord Belus (Phallus) was a Euphrates name, therefore India, he thinks may have got this worship from Aithiopia. I incline to think that the reverse is near the truth, for we now know that the Babylonians and Asyrians were Shemites, which Bryant did not. He says that the Koothites entered upon and conquered Egypt as “Shepherd Kings,” and that the cause of their occasionally being called Indi was on account of their coming from the Indus. We shall hear a great deal more of them as we proceed onwards, meanwhile we must investigate the orthodox patriarch NIMROD. Mr. Rawlinson adheres to the Bible story that an actual person Nimrod founded the Kaldian empire, because the unknown writer of the Old Testament narrative and Moses Chorene, a writer with all his countryman’s prejudices in such a matter, speaks to this effect. Our historian also boldly asserts that we actually find this name Nimrod in the history of Kaldia as the “Lord of Nipoor” or Niproo. We are told that he is Bil or Enoo, which it is “proposed to read Niproo”!2 a word translated by our un-known Jewish writer as the “Mighty Hunter,” a phrase which has entirely misled the European world and thrown them completely off the scent; for if so translated, the meaning is not a hunter of game, but a male hunting females—a term applied to Siva and to all bulls, dogs, and even loose and lascivious men. The better trans-lation is “The Establisher,” “A great strong one”3 like Am-On, Siva, Belus or Asher; “the Erector of the Tower,” “the Procreator,” “the Father or Lord of great peoples,” the Sun or “fertilising god,” for Sol is always “a Hunter,” as even Mr. Rawlinson 1 Keane’s T. and T. of Ireland, p. 224. 2 Anct.

The cuni-form, says Smith, gives him the character of a warrior, Hunter, Hercules and Mars; tablet K. 133 says he is “like a Bull . . . he rode over seed, he begat,” and is so vio-lent in the pursuits of fertilisation as to kill his own offspring.2 Nip or Nin is usually the name applied to any high or upright mountain, and corresponds to Al, El, or Ar; as in Ararat or Alalat, that is the hill of Al. This hill was also called the Nim-rud or Nim-tagh—rud being a great mountain, as witness the range over Lake Van culminating in Ala-Tagh, and then Ala-lat, portions of what others called a Hemus or Hermon, probably El-mut or El-mus the hill of El, the early Hebrew god. It was a Nin or Nim as the great Patriarch or Herakles of the race, that Asyria here symbolised in this wonderfully grand way, called him Bar-Shem, the Son of God (Shem) or son of the Sun,3 meaning the robust and irrepressible fertilizing powers of Nature. Herakles as the Sun was an ancestor of Ninus, but here we are at the root of the matter, for this Ninip is called in the tablets more than Apollo; he is “the Lord of the seed of his father,” and one who “violently proclaims” his universal rule or sway over all nature. Irish and Koothite peoples called Nin or Nim, Neimh, Neim, or Neamh, “Brightness,” “Heaven,” and curiously enough “Poison.” Now Siva is often called 1 Anc. Mons. I. 149. 2 Trans. Soc. Bib.

Our own island honoured and worshipped just such a god in Hu, Deon, Nav, Nev, Neiv-ion, &c.; and in the Asyrian Nin, Nip, Neb, &c., we are very near the old Keltic Nav “the Lord,” the “Creator.” Nev was his heaven, and as Dwy or Duv he was “the cause,” and as Dwy-van, “the lofty cause,” “high Creator,” or Most High God (Eliun) of Phenicians and Jews; see Gen. xiv. 18, 19. His queen was Dwy-Vach (Duevach) “the lesser cause” or “mother.”2 The Rev. Mr. Davies “infers that the patriarch Noah received divine honours,” as Neivion or Nâvhl that Nöe, was Dëon,3 and that both were “HU the mighty” whose chariot was drawn by solar rays; this deity also held the place of Bacchus, Osiris, &c., because he taught husbandry, and settled the race in towns and communities. Nor is there any doubt as to the ancient Kymri knowing all about this patriarch Nêv, Nöe, or Hea, long before Christianity, for the Reverend author says that the deifying of this god of the waters occurs “in horrid profusion” (for he recoils from Bible stories being so represented) among the very oldest bards.4 This Nöe, however, he insists from the facts before him, is Eseye, Hu or He, and Kid, or the chief Serpent god (Bel), and Ceres or Ceto;5 and Hu, he shows, was repre-sented like Jove and Vishnoo by the Eagle and called “the splendid mover”6 and “he with expanded wings;” so that these Kymri must have known all about the Hea of Asyria and the eagle-headed figure of her temple-palaces. Ancient Kelts called Hea, Pen-Annwyn, “the ruler of the abyss,” and worshipped him as FIRE. BAR-DEUS.—We have another name, BAR, still common to Kelts in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, which, says Rawlinson, was one of the names of the Asyrian Nin.7 Bar may be Pwr, Pyr, or Par—Fire, for he was a god like Horus, Apollo, Osiris, or Zeus. In old Irish “the Son of God” is called Bar-in-deus for Bar = Son = Ban, and Hebrew Ben; and with old Fins, Fin-Bar was “the Son of Fin,” or Neim, or the Son of God. His representative was shortened into Tin-bar, now known as St. Bar, our Barry. The first temple of Barindeus was at Goo-gane-Bara, eighteen miles from Macroom, where he warred with and vanquished a mighty dragon. This is one of the holiest spots in Ireland, and as usual is an island with a holy well, for he was the fish god, ever carrying his rod in front of him in his right, and the mystic basket of plenty below in his left hand, as I here give him. His mitred head-dress is left very open, for he is clearly androgyne; with rod in hand he strikes the waters, as a veritable Moses or Bac-chus. He appears elsewhere with the phallic cone instead of the rod as in the large figure given by Rawlinson (I., 167),where he de-nominates him “Nin, the Fish God” (for Nun signifies fish), and gives him drooping wings. 1 Keane’s T. and T.

Thus we see a heifer or cow with a woman’s breasts and head; the garooda or eagle of Vishnu and then of Zeus, with occasionally a man’s head; and the lion, bull, &c., with the wings of a bird to denote swiftness, universality of empire, godlike properties, &c.; but the bull, cow, tiger, lion, fish, &c., have also other well-known characteristics which were much revered by Phallic worshippers, and thought to be the special properties of Deity, and of all persons whom Jehovah loved. An eagle head, and wings to animals, may in almost every instance, be read as “continued” or “continuing energy” or “fertile force,” just as the figure of the serpent must be read “active passion.” BAR-CHUS AND MOSES.—It is not pleasant when in the midst of orthodox Eng-land to tell people they know nothing about the names and characters in their Bible, else I suspect many learned men whould long ago have explained to the churches a great many curious things, and amongst others, that Nimrod was Bacchus, the Phallic demi-god, rearer of vines and general introducer of fertility, and signified the same as Asher, Brah-ma, or A-bram, and now we are told the Izdubar of the tablets. The name Bacchus is Barchus, or the son of Kus or Kooth, which the Jews said Nimrod was, for “Bacchus is called Nebrodes, which is the very same is Nimrodes,” and he wore a tiger’s skin, and had a chariot drawn by tigers, which animal, in Hebrew and Kaldi, is called Namur. Bar, the son or male sign—the Za-Kar, is also Neb or Nim, the Nib or Point, and Bacchus was also Zag-reus, a name signifying in Greek “a hunter,” and with strange affinities.1 Nag, in Sanskrit and several other languages, is what Haig and Hag is in Keltic tongues, the Phallic serpent or serpently inclined creature, so that Zo, Zak, Zag, Bak, Bar, Hag, Nag, Nar, Nib, Nin, &c., are evidently Kus or Koothite roots connected with, or perhaps meaning the Phallus, and therefore applicable to all great Patriarchs, or those valued as propagating creatures, whether males of men, dogs, or cats; and hence Nimrod is quite a different kind of hunter from what the ordinary bible-reading public imagine. The two Phallic lord, Bar-Chus and Nimrod, were also similar in character, for both introduced and were cultivators of vines—so that the identification of these demigods, enables us to say that their followers were here the first settlers and intro-duced the amenities of life. As we are also told of the Indian travels and con- quests of Bacchus, we may gather that these Westerns held that this Faith and its civilzation had come to them from the East. Between Moses and Bacchus there is a very strong similarity—both had two mothers, the latter being called Bi-Mater, and both were Arabians and lawgivers. Orpheus calls Bacchus Mosen, Moshn;2 both were Bi-cornis or two-horned. A dog was given to Bacchus, so Kaleb, which is 1 In Tooke’s Pantheon the full authorities will be found quoted at p. 70 et seq. 2 Ibid., pp. 70, 71."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 37the Hebrew for a dog, was given as a companion to Moses. Both brought water from a rock by striking it with their rods; and as Bacchus dried up the river Orontes and far mightier Hydaspes with his wand, so did Moses the arm of the Red Sea. Wherever they went they conducted their children to a land flowing with wine, milk, and honey. One of Bacchus’ followers threw an ivy stick on the ground, when “it crept like a dragon, and twisted itself about an oak;” and in India, Bacchus commanded darkness to cover the people whilst he enjoyed complete day.1 Bacchus also wrestled with the great deity Pallene—that is Pallas, just as Jacob wrestled with his Phallic god; those who looked into the ark sacred to Bacchus were stricken with madness, and all who neglected his ceremonies (these having been introduced by Pegasus from Beotia) has to erect Phalli in his honour. Can two histories be more alike, and can we doubt the origin of their resemblance when we know that Ezra and his scribes wrote the Old Testament between 450 and 285 B.C.? Scholars tell us that the Kaldian Hea and Nebo were symbolized by the Phallic arrow-head or wedge, of which we see the worship on an altar sculptured on the glans of the large Asyrian Phallus, in the British Musum, and on the one given in the pre-vious vol., p. 207, which accounts for Nin or Nebo being the Hermaic cone God. The consort of Nebo was Urmitu (Oor, City or Moon of Mamitu the Akadian Lingam?), and both were divinities of writing and learning, and instructors of the Asyrians, for did not the manipulations of the arrow or wedge comprise all knowledge, just as was said of the Egyptian obelisk? No other symbol was admissible in writing, which is the reason why Toth, Hermes or Mercury, and Ninus were the deities and patrons of Wis-dom. “Nebo had a temple at Calah, and another in conjunction with Merodach (whom Mr Sayce called Nimrod) at Nineveh,”2 but Nebo—“the eastern sun in the height of heaven”—originally came from Borsipa to Babylon. Bel and Merodak are looked upon as the same, but Merodak’s consort was Zirat-banit, whom Hebrews called Sukoth-Benoth;3 Nergal, like Ninip, was a hunting and fighting god; and Nin, Nip, Net, Nef, seemm to have been represented in Egypt under the form of K-Neph, the creative power—that is, the creating parts of Godhead, by which we must understand that Kneph was the Lingam or “divine limbs of Osiris”—the material part of “the Primeval Soul.”4 “Nin, the planet Saturn, was the Fish God of Berosus,” and, says Mr. Wake, can be shown to be “really the same as the Asyrian national deity Asher, whose name and office bear a curious resemblance to those of the Hebrew leader Joshua,” “the Saviour,” whose father’s name, we may remember, was Nun, the phallic fish. Mr. Layard5 thinks that Athur or Asher was a “Lieutenant” whom Nimrod sent to build Nineveh, which is crystallizing a symbolism. The Kaldian word N-N is very pro-bably Ling, a mark or “standard” like the NISSI of Jahveh, or the Persian Nish-ān, 1 Tooke’s Pan., p. 72. The ivy wreaths of Bac-chantes were to be got from Meru, Siva’s heaven. 2 Smith’s “Asyria,” Christ. Know. Soc., p. 12. Trans. Soc. Bib. Arche. II. ii., 246. 3 2 Kings xvii. 30. 4 C. Stanisland Wake.

Birs Nimrood was the Kaldian holy mount, and is by some still considered the great Biblical Tower of Babel, but Sir H. Rawlinson thinks it was merely a Palace-Temple of the time of Ne-bukadnezar, and that the ruins of Babel will yet be found further south near Ere, Mugheir, and Sinkara.1 All travellers have found ancient and rude peoples, as we in India have found aboriginal races like Santals, Beels, &c., bowing down to what they call their “great mountain,” that is, their Phallic God, for great mountains are Sivas.2 Santals, like most Aborigines, symbolise him very grossly, either as like the whole organ as possible, or the mere glans, which I have seen wonderfully depicted on a tree, pillar, or wall. The earliest instance I know of Phallic worship or reverence, or at all events of Phallic drawings, is that mentioned in the Moniteur of January 1865. There it is related that in the province of Venetia, Italy, in a bone cave beneath ten feet of stalag-mite, and amidst post-tertiary remains, beside a bone needle, was found a rude draw-ing of a phallus scratched “on a plate of an argillaceous compound;” surely a very primeval idea of the Linga-in-Argha! I will now say a few words about Nineveh and its remains, for without an accurate knowledge of details, we cannot arrive at sound conclusions. NINEVEH, now Mosul, the last capital of Asyria, had two celebrated Mounds called Kouyoonjik and Nebi-Yunus, that is, Mound of Yuna, IOna or Jonah, which has no reference, however to that wondrous man of Joppa, but evidently has to this Yoni or IOnic name, for the city was IOnic in form,3 having walls washed by water and some three miles in length, aud this Nebi Yunus mound rising in the centre is the Omphe or Argha, around which the IONIM would congregate as would Lingamites around Kouyoonjik. The city appears to have had a circumvalent wall of about eight miles, and probably, as Diodorns affirms, 100 feet high, with a base of 50 feet. The most prolific of its ruins is the mound of Koujoonjik, of which the most valuable part is the Library of Aser-bani-pal (Sardinapalus), discovered by M. Layard. The Libraries of Senakerib and Esarhadon are at Nebi or Nepi Yoonas. One of the most ancient Asyrian inscriptions yet unearthed, was found by Mr. George Smith at Nimrood, which is held to be the Kala of Genesis. It states that Shalmaneser, a king of nations, was a son of Voolnirari, also a king of nations, and it was probably this Shalmaneser who built the last Nineveh—1300 B.C.4 It must have been an old capital then. Kouyoonjik is believed to contain older remains than the sites of the palaces of Senakerib and Aser-bani-pal. Mr Smith obtained tablets of the time of the Asyrian king, Asher-risilim, of about the middle of the twelfth century B.C. At Nimrood, bricks have been found belonging to a temple of Ishtar, dedicated “to Beltis, his lady”— 1 See London Athenæum, of 27th March 1875, as to this. 2 Staniland Wake comes to the same conclusion. 3 Diod.

In. the northern palace was found the translation of the very ancient Babylonian inscription of fourteen centuries before Aser-banipal, that is of about 22 centuries B.C., “which he ordered to be made.” We are here told that Agoo was the very early Babylonian king who built the temple of Bel; that Agoo was the son of Tasigoorooba, son of Abi, son of Agoorabi, son of Amiziriti, of the tribe of Soogamoona. Agoo recovered the images of Merodak and Zirat-banit, which had been carried away north-east of Babylon to the land of Hani. This Agoo is held to be the name of the Moon God in Akad, and the race was therefore Lunar. King Agoo called himself “king of Kasoo and Akad, king of Baby-lon, of Padan and Alman, king of Gooti, and of the four races.” Kasoo may be Mount Kasius bordering Egypt and Arabia Petrea sacred to Zeus-Am-On, or that which owned the travelling Zeus of Cilicia and of the Indian Punchea, whom I speak of elsewhere. In Agoo we possibly see the divine ancestor whom Sankuniathon describes as Ag-reus (Ag-Theus?) the first worshipper of Fire when Haliea (Truth?) was deified in Egypt. The Asyrian tablets always allude to the inhabitants of the Empire as “Sumirs and Akad” occupying the country from the sources of the two rivers to the Persian Gulf. M. Menant1 assigns the districts about Ararat—“Ur-Ar-thoo”—to the Akads, believing that one race was Aryan and the other Turanian, but that when the Empire flourished they were closely blended. He attributes the cuniform writing to the Turanians, and thinks it impossible to identify Aser-banipal with Sardanapalus. A tablet discovered at Nineveh2 says that the Medes conquered Babylon in 2280 B.C., so that, following Berosus in his list of kings which preceded the dynasty when this conquest took place, would give 5150 B.C. as the “Babylonian historical era.” Herodotus assumes that some Medes were long subject to the Asyrians, but that as a people the Medes “began the revolt from the Asyrians after they had maintained the dominion of Upper Asia for a period of 520 years”3 which points to the Medes being rulers in the North, as in Baktria and along the Caspian, and therefore as having Magi, Fire, and Sun-worship there about 1400 years B.C., when the Aryans, whom we later call “Persians,” were worshipping Sooranya (Sun) and Venus, and were therefore the Western Vishnooites or IOnim. ROYAL LIBRARIES.—Let us now look to our records, for we must clearly under-stand on what authority all Kaldian, Babylonian, and Asyrian history stands; and happily before this went to press, though several years after the chapter had been first 1 Asyrian Annals. 2 Sir Henry Rawlinson at a meeting of the Society of Biblical Archeology, Record, 6th Dec. 1872. 3 I. 95."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 40written, a great number of most interesting works appeared, which have placed before us in the clearest manner the foundations of our historical structure.1 Fortunately we have not here to deal either with “Inspiration” or garbled paper, leaf, or leather documents, but letters stamped on soft clay and burnt or allowed to dry in the libraries of various monarchs; and these are abundant beyond our fondest hopes, and will yet yearly add to our knowledge. The priestly and Imperial collection began in Kaldia. from the very earliest times, and in Asyria with the rise of that monarchy. Tiglath-Pileger I1 had done much about 745 B.C., towards collecting and copying all the inscriptions of his prede-cessors and others, and Sargon in 722 had made great additions thereto, especially in matters astronomical and astrological; so that in 650 or thereabout, the imperial library was complete, embracing every subject which the learned world cared about, as religion, the various cosmogonies invented by the fancy of man, grammar, mathematics, law, his-tory, mythology, and tales of wondrous lives and characters founded on fact no doubt, though held to be “Gospel,” and often averred to have been written by divine inspira-tion, or received direct from the gods. Al1 that Egypt has, or probably ever will furnish us with, is nothing in comparison to the many thousands—some say a hundred thou-sand—of closely and carefully written Asyrian tablets. This Imperial Library appears to have been first systematically dealt with at Kala, long before the days of Senakerib, who in 705 B.C. removed it to Nineveh, but the collection dates back to probably 3000 B.C., though Mr Geo. Smith (who, by-the-bye, is ever telling us that he puts all dates “as low as he possibly can,”2 apparently to avoid the upsetting of Biblical matters) adjudges “two literary works . . . to be certainly older than the time of Urukh,”3 that is Erek, a city which we shall yet probably find. goes back to 5000 B.C. These are, he says, “the great Chaldean work on Astrology . . . the ex-ploits of Lubara” (who, he thinks, is Nimrod), which is written on seventy-five large tablets and belongs to Akad. It contains glosses, apparently later additions, mentioning kings of the period 2000 to 1850 B.C. About this date, also, comes the “History of Izdubar, the Flood, and Nimrod, probably written in the south country at least as early as B.C. 2000,” after which we have the tablets relating to “the Creation and Fall,” which seem to have “belonged to Akad or the upper division of the country.” There appears to have arisen about this period, both here and at Kootha, a mania for “collecting and developing various traditions of the Creation. Flood, Tower of Babel, and other legends,” so the source of the Jewish Pentateuch and cosmogonies of Berosus of Babylon, and Ctesias, are thus laid bare to us, for of course all would borrow from these great national records. Ezra, being a Jewish priest born and educated in Babylon, would gain a smattering of some of these various records, and naturally compile the best cosmogonies he could for his own people when permitted to return to Judea; and we 1 Assyrian Discoveries; Assyria for The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; and Chaldean Account of Genesis, by Geo.Smith.

As Sargon was consigned to an Ark of bull-rushes, and fed and preserved by the Solar God on the bosom. of the Euphrates, so, said Ezra or the other compilers and composers of the Old Testament, was Moses preserved from an angry Typhon and kept by Jahveh, also a Solar Deity. As Sargon or Sargina II is said to have written, in B.C. 1600, very sacred and important records,1 which we have now deciphered, so Moses was said to have written inspired records for his tribes, but which have unfor-tunately all perished;2 so at least we gather from Ezra, who with his scribes endeavoured to reproduce them, and the result is our Old Testament. The great monarch and conqueror, Asher-bani-pal, appears to have most diligently sought for records all over Mesopotamia, and to have transcribed from ancient docu-ments in some parts almost illegible. In one case there is actual proof of the antiquity of a text “from the original being found, and a thousand years older than the Asyrian copy.” It is also generally acknowledged that all we have found in writing, probably “existed as traditions in the country long before they were committed to writing.” Our various cuniform translators say that “we cannot consider the present discoveries as anything like sufficient to give a fair view of the literature of Asyria and Babylon, though what we possess takes us pretty accurately back to the time when Urukh, king of Ur, flourished some 2000 years B.C.”3 We have now before us records of the very ancient kingdoms of Karak, Larsa and Akad, all names telling us of Kor, Ak, Lar, Hur, or Ar, and signifying an intense Phallo-Solar faith; nor were these records “isolated,” but, as Mr. Smith says, parts of regular “collections or libraries which were placed in the different cities.” “In Asyria, the first centre of literature and seat of a library was the city of Assur, or Kileh-shirgat, and the earliest known tablets (there) date about 1500 B.C.;” but unfortunately few of these remain, though probably copies of most. In 885, however, Assur-nazir-pal, who rebuilt Kala, probably began collecting, and scribes were placed in the royal library of his son, Shalmaneser, in 850, to copy from Bablyonian tablets; and we find that the monarchs of 812 and 755 continued the good work, and that in 722 there was an “Asyrian royal library worthy of the Empire . . . with Nabo-sugub-gina ap-pointed as principal librarian.” After this “the study of early literature became a marked feature of the time.” In 673 Asur-bani-pal became “magnificent in his pat-ronage of learning . . . adding more to the royal library than all the kings who had gone before him; . . . his agents sought everywhere for inscribed tablets,” ransacking “the literary treasures of Babylon, Borsipa. Kootha, Akad, Ur, Erek, Lama, Nipoor, 1 Smith’s Chaldean Account, p. 28, but see the actual translation by Mr. Talbot in Assyrian Texts: Records of the Past, vol. v, 2.

It would seem also that these records must be immenaely older than our orthodox translators state, if written at all near the times they refer to; the Izdubar series call this Demi-God a “Lord of the oaths or pledges of the world”2—that Jupiter Fœderis, or pillar-God before which Jacob as well as Josiah swore, and say that he existed with Ishtar and Solar Bull-worship, for Izdubar and Hea-bani, (son of Hea), fought against the Bull (Solar worship) and killed it;3 on which Ishtar, or “the Principle of Fertility, descended into Hades, Hell, or region of Sterility” of which more hereafter. The Records of the Imperial Library were sytematically arranged in the upper rooms of the west and north palace buildings of Kouyunjik, and therefore suffered in the great conflagration of 607 B.C., when the last monarch committed himself, his family, and all the state records and valuables to the flames. A dark year this in the annals of literature, but not so bad as it would have been if the records had been like those of most peoples, on leaves, leather, or paper. All were dried, or perhaps slightly baked tablets of clay, from an inch to a foot square. They seem to have “been arranged by the librarians according to their subjects; . . . stones com- menced on one tablet being continued onto other tablets of the same size and form. In some instances the number of tablets in a series, and on a single subject, amount to over a hundred; each subject or series having a title formed by the first phrase or part of phrase in the subject,” a better plan than our mere “catch words.” To make reference more secure “at the end of every tablet in each series was written its num-ber in the work, . . . and to further preserve the proper position of each tablet, every one, except the last in a series, has at the end it catch phrase, consisting of the first line of the following tablet.” Then again, “there were catalogues of these documents, . . . and other small oval tablets with titles on them, apparently labels for the various series of work.” Of course there were custodians, as well as buildings ex-pressly constructed as libraries, and, adds Mr. George Smith, all these regulations were of great antiquity.4 No old nation can show anything of this kind, and all old writings, especially from 2000 to 600 B.C., we must therefore narrowly and warily scan, as likely to have been borrowed from this great Mesopotamian warehouse, with which only Egyptian, Indian, and Chinese stone tablets can compare. The most ancient records transcribed from Kaldia and Babylon do not unfortunately give us the dates of the originals, for ancient peoples did not like to dabble in dates. Egyptian, Jew, and Greek are equally chary of giving these strong keys to the opening up of their mysteries, or upsetting of their narratives; so only exhaustive research and critical acumen will ever reveal the chronology of these old kingdoms. But more than accuracy was attempted by the old Kaldian writers; they cultivated style, and expressed 1 Chald. Acct., p. 36. 2 Ibid., p. 34. 3 p. 7. 4 pp. 19-31."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 43themselves “in a noble style of poetry, appealing to the strongest feelings of the people, . . . and registering the highest efforts of science.”1 We find psalms and songs and prayms and hymns in wild profusion; “germs of thought,” says Dr. Birch, “which grew up into blossoms amongst other races long after the parent stem had lain a sapless trunk in the distant regions of the Euphrates.”2 Thus, then, we see the source, even in this particular, of that poetic style and force for which Hebrew sacred writings have been long famous. Their Sanhedrin and leading schools of thought had long existed in Kaldia, from which also they borrowed their square written character; and, says Mr. George Smith, “this classic style (of Kaldian literature) remained down to the Persian conquest, or about 500 B.C., that is to Ezra’s time.3 Language, however, like religion, does not stand still, and that of the tablets gradually diverged, and finally became quite different from that of the people. Ezra and Nehemiah found that the Jewish tribes in Syria did not understand them, and similarly, all or any records which they may have carried out of Babylon with them would in time be unknown even in the land of its birth. BEROSUS.—Berosus tells us, and, as a priest of the first temple of Kaldia, he should know (though deeply tainted with all the views of Ezra and the Jewish schools of Kaldi priests), that in Babylon “there were records kept with the greatest care, comprehending a period of above fifteen myriads of years . . . containing histories of the heaven and of the sea; of the birth of mankind; of king and their memorable actions.”4 These records, he says, relate that in the earliest times there came forth from the Erythrean sea, adjoining Babylon, an animal—“extraordinnry being, or immortal (¢fqiton) living creature”—endowed with reason, whose whole body was thtat of a fish, but the hands, feet, and voice that of a man, but with a fish’s tail behind, and a fish’s head over a man’s head.5 He taught the rude inhabitants the use of letters, arts, religion, law, and agri-culture, and at long intervals other similar beings appeared and communicated the same precious lore in detail, of whom the last was called O-Dakon. In time this lite-rary monster would no doubt become the DAGON (Dag-On, or Da-Gon, i.e., “Son of the Sun or God?”) worshipped all over Asia Minor by Hebrews as well as others. Even Kitto seems to think the story of Jonah, Iona, or I-Oan suspiciously like “the Baby-lonian fable of this sea-monster Oanes—a name not unlike that of Jonah.” It may be connected with the first person of the earliest Kaldian Trinity, An or Anu, and as Jesus is said to liken himself to Jonah, this slightly connects him in some manner with Oanes, Dagon, and the ancient phallo-solar mythology. Oanes, we are told, was often slain, and descended into the unknown abyss, or Hades, to rise again. The “sea-monster” which swallows Oanes is the same as that devouring monster in the Greek tale of Perseus and Andromeda, none else than 1 Chal. Acct.

We have similar tales from Classic and Skandinavian mythology, and many such in the writings of India. If Oanes, the Fish-god, founded Kaldian arts and civilisation, of even the most ancient kingdom, so did the Northern empire say that Nin or Nun established it; Asyria declared Nin was the beginning “or bubbling up of life;” the name is connectcd with the queen of the waters —Nun, the fish, if not with Nabe the navel.1 As a goddess, she was called “the queen of the land,” but Nin was also male, probably with only the difference of some vowel point, the loss of which occasions exactly the same confusion as might happen in the case of Ish or Isha, Siva and Sivi, namely an inverting of the genders. We observe that when spoken of in connection with Asher or Nergal (Mars), Nin is undoubtedly the female energy. Yet Nin is the Adam of Kaldia, Arabia, and India, of which Abram, a name unknown on the tablets till the 7th century B.C., is the Shemitic type. Nin-rah, says Inman (II. 384), is a euphemism for Yoni, the celestial mother, and od or ad is is “duration,” “a circle,” or “eternity;” whilst Nimrah is the Nekabah2 —Hebrew for Yoni, or “the female indented form.” In Asyrian sculpture, Nin though usually the winged bull, is also the fish with a human head, but spoken of under a periphrasis. There is little difference betwixt the n and r, at least in Asiatic language, and we know that Nir was a very early name for a man, lion, or any brave creature. Ar, a common name for a river, when pronounced hard, was Ak— the celestial source of fertility, as Ar was the terrestrial. Berosus tells us that the creation of heaven and earth sprang, in Kaldia, from Belus dividing the female principle or Being, Omoroka, Thalat, or Thalassa, the sea. Belus destroyed the animals in her “abyss,”5 here again used as the womb, and connecting creation with destruction, as India does in Doorga and Siva. This may be the origin of the Flood-idea, “for the whole universe then consisted of moisture,” and so Berosus is made to say that before this Deluge, there were ten great Kaldian monarchies—pro-bably meaning dynasties—which lasted for 432,000 years and which, in Turanian mea-sures or moons would be 33,212 year, a not unreasonable period in regard to the creation of man. The first ruler was Al-Orus, and the last Xisuthrus, son of Ardates, who was warned by Kronos to write a record of all past events, bury it in Sipara, “the city of the sun” and then construct a huge vessel for himself, family, some birds and quadrupeds. This says the quasi Berosus he did, and landed on the side of a great mountain in Armenia, where he at once offered adoration to Ceres—the Earth, burnt offerings to the heavenly gods, and then disappeared. He was a real Mahadeva of the race, and after his translation was termed “the answerer of prater, replying” say the early tablets, “to those who called upon him by voices from heaven.” It is now known that Berosus never mentions a Noachian Deluge.

Much more might be written on the TEHU and BEHU—the “Form”2 and “Void” of Genesis i. 2, which a learned writer tells us strictly conveys the meaning of the Form of the Obelisk and the Egg;3 but this I will not here enter upon. The consideration of the Hebrew word ALEIM—Gods—goes to the very root of the matter of Creation, for as already stated the modern Jewish term Elohim (Gods or Els) has no place in the Bible. The real word is Al-e-im, which good Hebraists say is Al, a “ram,” “the sun,” or “a strong one” (and hence a god—but bi-sexual), e “these,” and im the plural affix, hence Al-e-im, “those strong creating ones,” “suns,” “rams,” &c.4 but usually “gods,” though applied to Ba-al, 1 Kings xviii. 21, to a female deity, xi. 5, and to a male image, Ex. xxxii. 1, to “angels,” “kings,” “god-like images,” &c.5 SABBATHS.—The Asyrians had twelve great gods, clearly corresponding to the twelve “houses” or months of the great Fertilizer, just as all great leaders had twelve followers, twelve tribes, &c. The great old Trinity of ANU, HEA, and BEL, was claimed respectively by the very ancient cities of Erek, Eridu, and Nipur, where was elaborated a Theogony and Theology, which was old and stereotyped long before 2300 B.C., and “remained so,” says Smith, “with little change down to the close of the kingdom.” ANU was the great heavenly and somewhat abstract idea of God, the Lord of Spirits, Hea of the waters below, the emotional and passionate energies; and Bel was the Creator, the Fertilizer, Father of the Gods, and of all the world.

It seems, indeed, impossible to point to a single feature in present faiths which cannot be paralleled in these very old ones; thus a very distinguished philologist and clergyman of the Church of England points out that Asyrians had their Sabbaths just as Europeans have. He says that amongst the various festivals it was the most important, although the commonest; it was “the going forth of the moon on the 7th day,” and the Asyrian month was lunar; therefore “the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th were termed days of Sulum or Rest, on which certain works were forbidden to be done.” But the day was older even than Asyria,1 for, continues our philologist, Sulum is “but a translation of an older Akadian equivalent, which signified ‘Dies nefastus.’ ” A cuniform inscrip-tion commands that “the 7th days be the festival of Merodak and Zirpanitu; a holy day; a Sabbath for the ruler of great nations; sodden flesh and cooked food he may not then eat; his clothes he may not change; new garments he may not put on; scrifices he may not offer; the king his chariot may not drive.” Scotchmen may rejoice to know that they thus have here even an older authority than Moses for such restrictions, though they were instituted in honour of Merodak—Mercury of Maha-Deva—and note Aleim or Jahveh. This cuniform edicts goes on to say that not even the king may on this “Sabbath-Rest” sit in, or “establish a place of justice;” he may not legislate, nay, not even “take medicine for the ailments of his body;” he may not “make a measured square”? but he must, on the eve of the Sabbath, “in the presence of Merodak and Istar, erect an altar, make a sacrifice, and, lifting up his hand, wor-ship in ‘the High place’ of the God;” and we clearly see the God and his high place, and the meaning of the uplifted and open hand in the sculpture found in these parts, and supposed to belong to the Parthian monarchy, which I give on p. 139. The god is a Lingam on a high altar being worshipped by a Magus and others with open uplifted hands. The cuniform hemerologe which Mr. Sayce quotes from, prescribes that the Sabbath of the full moon, the 14th, shall be sacred to Nergal and Beltis, the 21st to Sun and Moon, and the 28th to Hea and Nergal, when “no white garments may be worn, and sacrifices must be performed at dawn.” The 19th of every lunar month was “the white day,” and sacred to the goddess Goola. Neither the name of the Sabbath nor its spiri-tual meaning was unknown 3000 to 4000 years ago, for the word Sabbattu was actually used, and said to signify “a day of rest of the heart.”2 How strangely consistent and uniform is our practice! Here is a writer for The Society for the Promotion of Chris-tian Knowledge able to assert that \"“he enactments (of ancient Akad, Babylon, and Asyria) were similar in character to those of the Jewish code”3—yea, verily, for here the poor captives from the Syrian highlands learned almost all they knew. 1 See Geo.

As the French and Irish prefer the softer and feminine form of Christianity, which per-mits the adoration of a lovely mother and child, to the Protestant worhip of a man-god only, so when Jews picked up their theogony or faith from their various masters, they still adhered to Baal, Baal-Peor, the Serpent-pole, and Bull Calf or Cone, that is the Sivaite rather than the Vishnooite form, although, of course, there were both sects amongst them as amongst all nations; thus we see why the “Creation tablets” relate that the Babylonians considered the moon the principal body, whilst Genesis makes the sun the greater light;1 the former here alluded to Yonites, and the latter to Lingam-wor-shippers, at all events until Moses introduced his Ark, and that was resisted, and had to be accompanied by the Serpent-pole and Fire to make it in any degree popular. “The Tree of Life,” mentioned in Gen. iii. 22, “certainly appears,” says Mr. Smith, “to correspond to the Sacred Grove of Anu, which a latter fragment of the creation tablet states was guarded by a sword turning to all the four points of the compass;” and there, too, we have allusion to “a thirst for knowledge having been the causes of man’s fall;”2 the gods curse the dragon and Adam for this transgression. This Adam was one of “the Zalmat-qaqadi, or dark race,” created by Hea or Nin- zi-ku, a name pointing to Hea being a Nin or Creator, whilst Adam is called Adāmi or Admi, the present eastern name for “man” and the Lingam, and no proper name.3 Hea mentions the revolt of “the Dragon of the Sea or of Tiamut,” and calls it Karkar,4 the name of a very ancient capital, which leads us to infer that Karkar was the original great seat of Kaldian Ophite Worship, which the Hea, Nin, or Izdubar form of faith—probably a Lingamite revival—was trying to supplant about 2000 B.C. RELIGIOUS REVIVAL.—The impression that I get from the legends of Izdubar, a Flood, or even the Creation Tablets, is simply that these were Religious Revivals; nearly every illustration of Mr. Smith’s last volume shows the serpent as an evil influence; thus we see it standing up behind two figures in front of a sacred fruiting tree (p. 91), so Bel with the sickle-like scymitar in hand is trying to cut it down (p. 95), as the scythe of Time cuts down all faiths. On the Plate opposite (p. 174) we are shown Izdubar, or the hero of the flood—Nimrod and Noah—firmly holding the Elamite lion ram, or sun by his claws, and strangling the serpent; by which we conclude that he is Siva desiring more especially the worship of himself—the Nin or Lingam; whilst the figure on p. 239 shows us both Izdubar and Hea-bani fighting the lion and the bull, and the figure on p. 262, exhibits the gods of that period shedding refulgent rays on the emblems of an unmistakeable worship; here, two rampagious-looking scorpion-men, with very conical helmets and a unicorn horn, are shown revering a phallus or the glans on a stand under the solar ray, from which proceed two croziers; see Fig. 207, VII. and XI., where Hea is the Bull-Man and Izdubar, the man with his hand on the Ram’s throat. Now, if I am right, and all I have read elsewhere tends to the same conclusion, then all these 1 Chal. Acct., p. 75. 2 Ibid., p. 88.

If my readers will glance through the illustra-tions of Mr. Rawlinson’s Anct. Monarchies, they will see abundant verification of war with dragons, such as that fine plate which Mr. Smith gives us opposite page 62, where Bel, the sun, armed with the double-headed Trisool of Siva (but here clearly signifying wavy fire), is driving out the winged draconic monster, representing that phase of faith which, it was thought, usurped more than its share of phallo-cult. This is paraphrased in all religious writings down to the apocalyptic tale of Michael or Mahi-Kāl warring with the dragon, “the old serpent,” who is in these later days called by Christians “the Satan.” That he is also Bel, the solar god, we see by the highly phallic sculpture of him1 standing on the tiger, with the bow and arrow—a Sri-Linga—in one hand, and the other upreared and open, giving his commands to a man holding a closed fist, with thumb passed through it upwards, and having two rearing unicorns behind him, with Luna as Ishtar overhead, and two fruitful palm trees on either side of the group. One of the oldest tablets gives, I suspect, the original of all the western world stories of Typhon warring with the gods, as Arkites like Moses warred with Aaronites, saying Jahveh killed those who opposed the ark and its god; as Gibeon or Ephodites fought against Baalites, and as in India, Lydia, and elsewhere, the Heraklidæ fought with and displaced the Yonites or Atyadæ, the first great dynasty of the coasts of Asia Minor. In all cases, those who overcome are Gods, and those who fail, Demons, Titans, the followers of Azazel, Satan, or “the Adversary.” ZU’S WAR.—Mr Smith gives us in the original three very important words met with on the tablet about Zu’s war, being unable as yet to translate these, viz., Um-zim-i, Parzi and Terete, the former of which he justly thinks “is some talisman or oracle in the pos-session of Bel which was robbed from him by Zu.” The whole “story of the sin of Zu” reminds Mr. Smith of the outrage of Ham on his father Noah, and the mutilation of Ou-ranos by his son Saturn.”2 It is necessary to bear in mind that this “mutilation” con-sisted of depriving the fertilizer of his virilities, as we see being done by the Scorpion in the picture of Mithras, Vol. I., p. 461, and that this merely signifies the wintry destruction of fertility, which every object in this picture of Mithras assures us of. Thus then I would understand that when Zu says as in this tablet: “12. Let me carry away the Umsimi of the gods. 13. And the Terete of all the gods, may it burn,”—that the Palladium or male Triad is what this Ouranos is to be deprived of, and that this was valued as Ireland valued her stone of Tara, and Scotch and English monarches their stone chair—“the Cadair or Cell of the Cow,” on which our Queen was the last to sit, though it was Uthyr’s or Arthur’s, the Solar king’s own peculiar seat.3 1 See Geo. Smith’s Fig. on pages 99 and 100, where he calls Bel, Merodak, and Michael all one. 2 Chal.

"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 50This wicked Zu, who elsewhere appears as “a bird of prey,” longs to establish a throne, and to “possess the Parsi;” but he casts this away, after obtaining “the Umsimi which he took in his hand,” when all became darkness and disorder in the kingdom of Bel; and, Anu and Vool had to be solicited to restore order and life to gods and men. Clearly Zu is winter, and another tablet actually calls him “the storm-bird,”1 that is the Bran or Raven of Kooths and Kelts, which is said to shut up the Ked or Ark of Caer or Ceres. None but great Anu can arrest Zu; Nebo is begged by Ishtar to “slay him with thy weapon,” that is the lingam or fertility, but he like Vool and Bel only appeals to Anu. It is clear that Zu is equal in power and greatness to Elu, and is the Aleim or El-Shadai of the Jews, for Zu appears on one occasion as Sar-turda2 the great god worshipped by Izdubar, who, say our translators, is Noah and Nimrod; now Noah’s god was Al-e-im or El-Jah. NIMROD AND FLOOD.—Our Asyrian and cuniform students do in reality quite upset the Biblical story of Noah and his flood; Mr. George Smith, after years of patient in-vestigation, having arrived in 1876 at the conclusion that Nimrod, who was the grandson of Noah by Ham and Kush (that is an Amite or Amorite, and Koothite) was Noah or a king in Lower Kaldia under the name of lzdubar, the companion of Hea-bani or Son of Fire.3 Now this Izdubar was an Interloper, and Hea was his Magus or priestly adviser, and they two warred with the lion and bull, by which we seem to be told that they opposed the Tauro-phallic cult of Elam and Asyria, and tried to establish Fire-faith, but were foiled, metaphorically by a deluge, that is by the faiths of Dagon, OAnes, or the salacious energies which water represents. They attacked Ishtar, the principle of fertility, who offered at first to coalesce with them, but she, driven by them to Hades, made sterility to reign over all Babylonia, which finally caused an uprising of the people, who, like a flood, swept Izdubar and his followers away into the mountains of Armenia where fire ever had and still has an abiding-place, and from which it ever and again descended, till finally and almost entirely forced out of Western Asia by the Moslem, its scattered votaries effected an escape to the Indian coast, where we know them as Parsis. This appears to me as reasonable an explanation of the tales of Floods as we can at present urge, though such are susceptible of other interpretations, as I have elsewhere suggested; apparently these tales had different meanings at different times and among divers nations. According to the tablets, Izdubar was deified and had prayers offered to him,4 as I have elsewhere shown from writers who divined thist long ere the world had found or could read tablets. No possible reading of any tablets describe such a flood as Jews and Christians believe in. The Nimrod or rather “Evechus” of Berosus was, though perhaps not then thought so, clearly a faith, not a man, for “he 2400 years”;5 some: writers make him “con-temporary with Abraham, the inventor of idol-worship and a furious worshipper of fire.”6 1 Chal.

Rawlinson thought Nimrod was the deity Ner-gal, because this signifies “great man;” the Rev. Mr Sayce identifies him with the god Merudook (Merodak) whilst Canon Rawlinson thinks a Nimrod reigned about 2400 B.C., and Professor Oppert believes Nim-rod to be a mere geographical expression. The Izdubar tablets tell us that Izdubar had a mother called Danat, i.e., “a goddess;” that he was a native of Amurda or Marad (the Akadian name for Merudook), and worshipped the god Sar-turda;1 that he had a strange dream which none could interpret till the sage Hea-bani,2 a very salacious looking crea-ture, was found; he became a great friend of the king’s, and the story is here a parallel to those of Joseph and Daniel. This Hea-bani was a sort of Satyr or Faun, with very prominent parts (see Fig. 207, XI.), and the feet, horns, and tail of an ox; he lived with wild animals in a cave, and was with difficulty induced to go to the city of Ur; unfortunately Mr. Smith does not tell us all, saying that it is “hardly adapted for general reading”!3 Thus the key of the two characters is hid from us by that absurd modesty which has so much misled us, from the multitudinous translations and com-mentaries on that most indelicate of books—the Bible—to the last discovered tablet. The great enemy of this Izdubar was the Elamite monarch; his people were called “pine trees” (Lingamites?), and he himself Hum-baba, probably “Father Um or Am,” that is our “Baba-Ad,” or Adām (Siva) of India. This Hum “is thought to be the last of the dynasty which, according to Berosus, conquered and held Babylonia for two centuries between 2450 and 2250 B.C.”3 but which came into power about 34,000 years, or if we take this to mean Moons, then 2600 years before the Flood,4 Kaldia having had eighty-six kings of her own before this period. This entirely throws out the above conjecture, and however we may treat the years of Berosus, we must give due weight to his eighty-six Kaldian kings after his flood; and then eight Median kings. I gather from the cuniform translations that Izdubar and Hea-bani were Solo-Arkites warring with the Lion or Lingamites of Elam, for they seized and destroyed the bull just as Moses did the calf or cone of Aaron; Hea-bani “cut off the member of the divine bull and threw it to Ishtar,5 who, with all her maidens, fled horrified, when Izdubar took the mangled hull “to the ark of his god Saturda, and dedicated it and worshipped (before) his fire.”6 So Moses ground the golden calf to dust before Jahveh; the parallel is complete, and the Izdubar tale but a mode of showing us a change from Lingamism to Solar Yonism. We have a wonderfully fine rhapsody of grief in the hymnal dirge from Hades, where Ishtar consigned herself, on which occasion Shamar (the Sun) weeps; part of it runs thus:— “ The cow with the bull will not unite; The ass, the female ass will not approach, Nor the female slave the vicinity of the master; The master ceases his command, And the female slave her gift.” 1 Chal.

These scorpion men have in their upraised wings and prominent unicorn, some of the characteristics of Hea-bani, for the latter is strictly the type of fertile force as we see from the tablet which says that Izdubar deemed it time to fly on losing him, because the land at once became sterile and dead. So on his death, Izdubar flies with his ark to the northern mountains of Nazir, and “pours out his libations to the four winds, and builds an altar on the peak of the mountain,”2 like a good Igni-Solar Arkite. It is evident from what we read in the tablet that the Kaldian also gave the Jew his idea of Jhaveh liking “a sweet smelling savour,” but not here of flesh and fat and blood as the O.T. avers, but of sweet smelling woods, as “Reeds, Pines, and Simgar and seven herbs.” “The gods,” says Izdubar, “gathered like flies over the sacrifice,” on account of “its good savour.” There is no connection, however, between the so-called flood of Izdubar, and that of Noah, the one lasting a year, and the other only fourteen days, when not only was the Kaldian ark raised to the height of the highest mountains, but swept away up to the far-off ones of “Nazir,” which our translators believe to be upper high Media or Armenia. There is, however, a striking parallel between the tale of the emasculation of the Kaldian bull and that of Osiris (who was the bull of Egypt, and on whose account Isis, like Ishtar was utterly discomfited)3 as well as in the story of the destruction of the bull, bull-calf, or cone of the Hebrews in the presence of the Arkite chief Moses. It “cannot also be accidental,” as Mr. Smith says, that all these peoples had ten great chiefs, viz.— KALDIAN KINGS EGYPT.  JEWS. Al-orus . . . Ptah . . . Adam. Ala-paras . . . Ra . . . Seth.

I have with much labour condensed into these chronological columns a great deal of important matter, especially concerning the gods, temples, and periods of holy rites, which can only be found by searching through a vast number of learned works. Space will not permit of my here entering into many details, but I refer my readers to the excellent works on Western Asia. by Layard, George Smith, &c. and especially to “Ancient Monarchies” by George Rawlinson, the Rev. Canon of Canter-bury, to whose valuable works every student of history must feel much indebted. In various important conclusions I have been compelled to differ from this learned author, but necessarily so; we start from a different basis altogether, he accepting of course the entire truth and inspiration of the Jewish writings, and therefore investigating with foregone conclusions, whilst I simply take all histories and faiths for so much as, and no more than these commend themselves by their intrinsic merits to my judgment. I am, of course, heedless of the consequences to which inquiry may lead, as to the downfall either of creeds or so-called histories, being concerned only with the attainment of truth. LANGUAGE.—I have spoken elsewhere regarding the language in which the history of Asyria has come down to us, and several facts in connection with this can be gleaned in the right hand column of the Chart, but must here remind my readers that in the seventh and eighth centuries, the Kaldian. tongue had entered upon what Jews and Christians would call its Hebraic phase, and was beginning to be written in a square rather than the pointed Akadian or ancient Kaldian character.1 This, in the days of the earliest tablets, must have been Turanian, then Aryan, and later, Shemitic, and of course more or less at times a mixture of all of these. It is usual to call the most ancient language which has come down to us, an Armaico-Shemitic dialect. The Jews would speak a Pheni-cio-Shemitic tongue when first taken away eastwards, and this we see they had for-gotten when Nehemiah tried to instruct them on their partial return in the fifth cen-tury B.C. He and Ezra had clearly to translate the older—evidently a dead language, for in such most priests prefer embodying their sacred writings. I say “most,” for plain-spoken, reasonable men like Boodha and Confucius avoided this blind of priest-craft; the former as well as his disciples wrote in the commonest dialect of the people, so that every man should understand, and not the learned only. Boodha despised the sacred Sanskrit of the Brahmans, just as the honest teachers of these days throw aside Latin or Greek when they wish to instruct the people. The Asyrians of the Empire were a Shemitic people with an admixture ofAryan blood, but the ancient Kaldians came from the North, and were Kooths, Kyklops, or Aithiopians, and connected with Egyptians. Memnon, king of Aithiopia, Rawlinson holds to be the son of a. Cisian woman, i.e., a Soosanian, while the Egyptians hold that Memnon was their Amoonof III., whose statue is the “vocal Memnon.” There was a tribe of Memnones at Soosa as well as at Meroe, regarding which fuller details will 1 Anc.

These lands still abound with abundant remains of both their faith and their labours, and in names such as Larissa, Lars, Pals, Bel, Ben, Bars, Ar, Ak, Pi, Pa, &c., we are constantly reminded of the stern facts of their history. Kaldians and Asyrians, we see by their remains, were deeply immersed in all the first symbolic faiths before we have any written history of them. When known to us, they were ardent Phallo-Solar worshippers, which they continued to be up to the fall of the Persian Empire; at times fire and many purifying influences dominated, and of course there were many bright and pure spirits and writers amongst them, just as we see in the Jewish tribes, sunk though the masses were in every abomination. In trying to establish this, we must not insist on the too minute identification of each god with our well-known Phallo-Solar gods of these days. Europe is too unyielding in this respect for the Asiatic or ancient mind. Thus Siva has over a hundred names, because he represents Life and Destruction, the Poisoner, and Life-giver, as well as all the various tempers, passions, features, and ideas of man. During a month’s march in India one may come across scores of Ashers and Ishtars, without hear-ing them called Sivas and Sivis half-a-dozen times; yet that Siva is Asher, the great creating Almighty One, no student of Babylonian and Indian faiths can for a moment doubt. It is probable, also, that Asher was as purely worshipped in Mesopotamia five thou-sand years ago as he is this day in India, but it may be also true that his female form gave as great occasion for the indulgence of lascivious desires, frolics, and libidinous paintings and sculpturings, as does the softer religion of Vishnoo. Siva and Asher were severe and ascetic gods, which the writer of Anc. Mons. does not seem to be aware of. Asher, like Siva, was a Trinity and a Unity, and called also a hundred Trinities and a hundred Unities. He was Al, El, Il, and Ra, Love; yet also Anoo, Bel, Shams, and Sin, and the Western Amon, Zeus, Pluto, and Neptune, according to the idiosyncrasies of his followers. Ashat, Shallat, and Saklat (Sanskrit Sakti), were Asyrian names for a wife, 1 Anc. Mons. I. 611."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 55and Ashat-zu was “his wife,” but the wife of a god was called Dam, which may be the origin of our Dame, a word used by Kelts and the Septuagint translators. Ashrat were any divine Asyrian images, such as the Hebrews call Ashra. Ash-mar is a spear, Ashal the Asyrian sacred tree (Hebrew, lca, Gen. xxi. 33), and Ash-lish is “like a tree,” whilst Asah-el is to get or create, as El creates; so that Ash means an upright growth as the Tree or Lingam-God, and like him also Fire. Ash = A-esh, or A-ish, and combined with El, the God Ash, very commonly the Ligneus penis.1 The “Horned Astarte” or Ashtaroth Karnaim of Gen. xiv. 5, is held to refer to Isis;2 and Ishtar, plural Ishtarat, is the Hebrew Ashtaroth and Greek Astarte, contracted, says Gesenius, in 1 Chron. vi. 71, from “the temple of Ashtara.” Nineveh was called “the city be-loved by Ishtar,\"”and Asoorita was her Ship or Elipse, which the devotees addressed as “My Lady.” Ini, “the eyes,” is also a word much used in connection with her, see page 72, Vol. I. CHIEF GODS.—Ilu appears to have been a general term for God, as Deus, and Ilim, its plural; so Asher-resh Ilim, signifies “Chief of the Gods,” and Ilu-Sha-Akhari, “God of Foreigners,’ like the Hebrew Aleim Akharim. Ish-tar is a cunifor word signi-fying “Star of Love” or “Queen of Stars”—occasionally applied to the Virign Mary. The cuniform character disappeared with the Macedonian conquest, but we have many important words—ancient Egpytian, and Sanskrit,3 the roots of which can only be found in the cuniform. Let us look at the earliest deities of the old Kaldians, and trace these according to the Eastern and not Western mode, which many writers on Babylon adopt; thus, though we have first cognisance of Hoor or Kaldi, the Moon City, we must not on this account fancy that any people place her (or, at times, him) before the Sun. The Supreme Gods, here as elsewhere, are AL, EL, or IL, AZ, etc., or shortly A, the male symbol; this yields such words as Alah, Asher, &c.; and all the subsequent manifestations of him. A is often in the East understood or is an unpronounced prefix, and may be so in A-Esh, A-El, A-Ir, &c., for which we may simply say Esh, El, or Ir. In early Kaldia we have the MALE trinity. ANA or OANES, represented by the number 60. BEL or ENOO or NIPROO, represented by the number 50. HOA or HEA or Serpent, represented by the number 40. The FEMALE energies are ANAT or ANOOIT. BELTIS or NIPROOT, or ENOOTA, or MULTIA. 15. Dav Kina. 1 Talbot, Jour. As. Soc.

The planets also have female Energies. SATURN or HERCULES has NIN or NIP. JUPITER has MERODAK. MARS has NERGAL, 12 VENUS has ISHTAR. MERCURY has NEBO. NIN being the Asyrian Hercules, so in Kaldia; KAL = NIP, KALNA = NIPER, KALA = NIMROD, for KALA is SIVA. His wife or female energy was ZIR-BANIT. The Lion-Man, the NARSINGH, NARITEN, or VISHNOO, the fertilising Sun. His wife was LAR, or LARS, i.e., the Yoni. Woman-Fish, WATER, an ARK, FERTILITY. Hence “Holy Water,” Holy Wells, &c. His female energy is WARMITA, and occasionally ISHTAR. He is usually a tall, upright man, with his hands crossed in front. In Egypt P’tha or P’Ra meant Sun, and as he was King of Heaven, so the earthly King may have been called Phra-aoh or Pharaoh, but vowels and aspirates are here of little account. As a rule, each male was worshipped wherever his female Energy was, because she was his Ark, House, or Abode, so Bel was worshipped in BELTIS and UR, as well as in special dwellings of his own, as at Dooraba. 1 Hislop’s Two Babylons, p. 38.

That “Asher is the great Lord—Supreme over all Gods.” 2d. ,, “Bel is the Father of Gods—Lord of World.” 3d. ,, “Sin is a Leader—Lord of Empire.” 4th. ,, Shamas is the Establisher of Heaven and Earth. 5th. ,, Iva [Vul] is he who causes tempests to rage over hostile lands. 6th. ,, Nin [Abnil or Ninip] is he who subdues Evil Spirits and Enemies. 7th. ,, Ishtar is the source of the Gods—“Queen of Victory,” who arranges battles, and corresponds to the Máya of India, “the Queen of Heaven,” as distin-guished from Venus, Love, and its passions, which, however, she also represents. ANOO.—AN, ANA, IL, and RA are thus the same God, varying only according to the age and speech in which he is addressed. Probably from ANA comes OANES or ANEDOTUS, who is also thought to be the Deity Hoa-Anes or Gods Hoa and Anes, more especially worshipped by I-OANES, IONIM or IONIANS, from whom of course must have come Jahveh’s “prophet Jonah” or Iona.3 With most writers, Anoo is the great abstract Almighty. Appeals lay to him when all aid from other gods failsed, as when gods and men besought that the hand of the wintry Destroyer, the Kaldian Zu, should be stayed. Zu was Anoo’s agent, sometimes called Lubara or Dabara, Pestilence and Destruction. Mr. George Smith thinks Zu a form of Ninip and a friend of Ner, a deity of Desolation and of Hades. Itak—such another—was a forerunner and companion of Pestilence, and one who specially “set his face towards Syria,” and was also only amenable to Anoo. Thus Anoo was a god exactly like Jahveh, often trampling down old and young, and making even “the good gods” like Elu (Elohim) ashamed and secretly wrathful, though obliged to restrain their anger.4 It is a pity our translators so often use biblical words such as “Syria,” &c., for the original word, nay letters, would be far more valuable to us, and would no doubt often tell us of the ancient land and its faith, which a modern word like Syria hides. 1 [Ishtar was said to be the daughter of the moon god Sin. See, e.g. Records, i. 145. — T.S.] 2 Anc. Mons. II., 311 [Also in Records of the Past, vol. v., 5 sqq.] 3 Ibid., i., 145 4 Geo. Smith’s Chal.

The great son of Anoo was called Bil-kan or “Lord Bel,” meaning “the active power of the Sun” and therefore Fire; so that Bel comes to be often identified with Vool or “Vul” (the Vulcan of the Latins and Tubal Kain of Hebrews), and as B and V are interchangeable, and the vowel in Bel may be as in Hebrew o or indeed u, there is clearly no difference. So Bel is often Elu, and Balim, Elohim, whose Saki, Ark, or “Sanctuary,” is Ishtar, the Star of Passion.2 VOOL is usually known as “the Air god,” but he has also the titles Pur (Fire?),3 Raman or Rimon, “the self-existent,” that is male and female energies of heaven and earth, as Rimmon the pomegranate; the Fire is male and female as the Energy of Terra. VOOL is also called Tuban and Ben; in Armenia he was Teiseba, and in Syria and Arabia, Daddi; everywhere he was worshipped and considered a specially active god, controlling the atmosphere and wielding storms and the thunderbolt. Hea as the great creator of the Trinity gave him orders, and so we find that when wickedness became rampant on the earth Elu or Bel (Elohim or Jahveh), appealed to “Vul to drink up the rain,” so “the ground was har-dened . . . corn ceased and blackness spread over the fields which then brought forth thorns”4—a curse one would think not likely to put an end to wickedness, but on the contrary well adapted to increase both crime and misery. THE TRINITY AND TWELVE GODS.—Including the Trinity, there were twelve great deities, and this from the very earliest to the latest days of Babylon, so this faith had a long and enduring reign, extending over some two thousand years. Of course the number twelve refers to a Solar origin and Zodiacal signs, and as Anoo had an abstract and purely passive form as well as an active one such as Sol and Apollo, Osiris and Horus, and indeed as in the idea of Jehovah and a Messiah, so we see that Babylon or Egypt set this example to the west, of a great god accompauied by twelve attendant deities and also “a Trinity in unity;” for there were no hundred gods here but a duality, or good and evil ones. I here give the names, powers, titles, and principle residence of the other nine deities. The 4th. SIN . . . . of Ur—King of Brightness—the Moon. ,, 5th.

NURKU (Universal)—The lofty One who holds the sceptre. ,, 11th. BELAT or Beltis of Nipoor—Wife of Bel and mother of Gods. ,, 12th. ISHTAR (Universal)—The Eldest of heaven and earth—Love and Passion. Below these came all other gods, then the IGEGE or heavenIy angels, and the Anun-naki or “Angels of Earth,” and lastly the GENII or “SPIRITS of good and evil;” prominent among which were the Sedu, Vaduka, Gallu, &c. 1 Geo.

AN was the Man-phallus, and when Asyrian left Asher, the first capital, they called this new one which they founded higher up calanh or Kālāne (Kalne), according to the Septuagint and Talmud. Yet Tiglath Pileser even in 750 B.C. preferred Asher as his residence, and it was flourishing then, as we have records of a Moabitish king, “Solomon, sending tribute” to him here.2 It is possible that this is the Solomon the Jews claim as their king, for not a record on leather, papyrus, or stone has ever yet turned up to prove there ever was another. These Moabites spoke a Kaldi and Hebraic dialect, and owned “Kamus,” that is Kemosh, or the Sun, as their god-king, according to the inscriptions. NIPROO.—At a loss to discover the Jewish Nimrod and account for his being “a mighty hunter,” Mr Rawlinson tells us to “read Nipru or Niprut,” because something like the Hebrew word Nimrod or Nebroth!!3 but not a vestige of authority is offered for such a request; having granted him this, he then asks us to add Bil to it, and so accept Bil-Niproo as “Thank the Lord,” a name held suitable for king and city! He who loves true history, however, will reject both this Nimrod and Talmudic Nebroth, as mere fancy-building on a foregone conclusion. If anyone called Nebroth founded a city, we have no authority for identifying him with Bel the Sun-god, or any other. The He-brew legendary writings probably refer to Nipoor, Nifer or Kalne, and Bel was no doubt a Sun or Phallic god, and therefore as already explained “the hunter” of that city. Ni-proo may be from the root Napar ‘to pursue,’ but if a Phallic deity, as all the gods were, the pursuing meant was that of male after its kind, and is a term so applied to Siva. Nothing but ignorance of Phallic lore, and a considerable number of hunting scenes, could lead any one to suppose that the pursuit of passion was the pursuing of game. Probably the word is altogether a mistransalation, as pursuing meaus “to govern,” even according to our author.4 The Hebrews say he was a pursuer “before the Lord,” which may mean merely that the person Nebroth served or worshipped this god—the sun or Maha-Deva. Kala or Nimrood, and Kalne or Nipoor, were great cities celebrated for devotion to Bel, and perhaps we may therefore conclude that Ka or Kal was an early term for the Sun- god—for Ka-Ra became Babil. Mul seems to have been the Hamitic Babylonian for Bel; and hence Belta, and Mulita or Mylita of later days, was Bel’s female energy or Beltis.5 Rhea latterly became a name for mother Beltis, because 15, her symbolic number, was pronounced Ri by the Kaldians. Ba-al, Bol or Bul, lob, signifies “My Lord the Sun 1 The East had probably at this time Brahma and Maya. 2 Jour. As. Soc. III. i. 1867. Talbot. 3 Anc.

Bel in the Assyrian inscriptions may well have frequently been Ashur, but the Bablyonian Bel (e.g. in Herodotus) was Marduk. Beltis was usually, but not always, Ishtar; she may in some instances have been some other goddess considered a subordinate divine consort of Ashur. — T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 60or El,” and Ba-alim is the plural and embraced gods whether male or female. Ba-al may be compounded of Ab, father (or Be, in Keltic, “Life”), and El, Saturn, written la-ba, and the worshippers would be justly called Is-Ra-El or men who serve Ra-El the Sun-God. We see the full meaning of Ba-al in the Sanskrit Bala, “the strong One.” Jews loved him, and Saul, Jonathan, and David called their sons after him.1 Goo-Baal, a great king of Byblus, was also named Sibith-Baal or the “Host of Baal,” or “the Starry Sky.” Baal-Peor, rwop-lob, “the Lord the opener” of the wombs of all creation, was he after whom chieftains and lords claimed the “Droits de Seigneur,” which Europe only abandoned at the Revolution (Inman), and Ireland used to grant in the days of our fathers, and which India, if not a considerable portion of Asia, still freely yields. The right is but the con-tinuation of that sacrifice of the hymen at Babylonian temples described by Herodotus, perhaps corresponding to the sacrifice of the prepuce of the male, and in lieu of the older human sacrifice. Some think the dedication to Mulita2 to be a “remnant of a com-munal system” which made every woman in the first instance the property of the com-mune or tribe, and that this single sacrifice of herself in the temple sufficed to mark this ancient rule, and to remind men as well as women of the fact that we are all bound to one another, and that womanhood is the first common property of the tribe.3 In Babylonian days the sacrifice was clearly a religious act, as we see by the words addressed to the women, and by all the surroundings, of which much appears elsewhere. BA-AL.—Baal formed part of most religious names. We have Baal-Tamar—rmt-lob—Baal, the Palm-tree, or My Lord, the erect tree,4 in which combination, says, Fürst, the Tau, t, or older T “may perhaps stand for the Phallus, like Ar. Axmar, to stand up straight . . . the membrum virile.” Tammuz is the Sun, or a vigorous fertilizer; Tenah or Taneh, the “fig-tree, the fig,” and “copulation,” Portuguese, Figueria, but also the Banāna or Plantain, a peculiarly shaped and much prized fruit, which the Tamil Dravidians call Bala. It was the Taneh leaves, that Adam and Eve applied to cover their nakedness.5 The very verb Tan also signifies “to lie down with,” “to bow down,” “to copulate.” Baal-Perazim probably signified one of those sacred Sun-clefts through which people passed to purify and regenerate themselves. It is really “Baal of the clefts,” from paratz, “to cut open.” Many such clefts are given in my Plates. As Baal-Shalisha (hclc-) we have Baal as a Trinity, or Lord of the Mystic D, Delta, or triangle, “the perfect figure,” whom Zoroastrians worshipped in the more spiritual forms of Ormazd, Zern-Ane Akerene, and Ahriman, and Phenicians in Kronos, Pothos or Desire, and Omilke, Vapor. These the Greeks spoke of as Chaos,6 Erebus, and Ether, who produced that wondrous and universal egg from which sprang 1 1 Chron. viii. 3. Bala brother to Krishna. 2 Herod.

The celebrated temple where Herodotus says the women offered themselves to the worshippers was called Beth or Bit-Sh-g-h, hgc-tyb a word of important meaning, re-garding which students should consult Fürst and Inman (I., 365). It seems to me to signify the house of “the great Sacrifice,” meaning either fornication or seduction, for Shagah—still coarsely used, is “to press into,” “seduce,” “sing,” “celebrate” (Fürst). Sha-gal is “to burn,” and “cohabit.” The actual stone Hermes, Lingam or Mercury, the Kaldians called Mer-Kalis,1 Merudook or Amaroot, and his temples Beth-Kalishy, equivalent to the Irish name, Kol-tail, as is Aeasar to Asher, and Karam Loaoch to the celebrated Kromkruach, the Greek Steli, and Hebrew Matzebah, mildy termed “stones of prayer.” But we are wandering a little. HEA or HOA, the Serpent-god, was at one time a mystic half-man, half-fish, a king of fountains and rivers, and the ruler or husband of all founts, seas, and great deeps—that is of female principles. He was Maces, or the “Sea of Milk,”2 that by which Vishnoo created worlds, and his sign was the same as Asher’s or Ana’s, the wedge, arrow, or obelisk; he was the “God of Life,” or “Good-Giver,”3 and his city, Is or Hill, that which Greeks called Aei-polis, for he was Aei. As the upreared hooded snake of seven heads, the Asyrians called him Siba-Nakad, but in very ancient inscriptions he is Tsir-Maki, or “finely long,” “straight,” and “the growing one,” an epithet also applied to tall timber trees. bulls and lions, and therefore clearly meaning salacious and obeliskal objects. Brahma, say Hindoos, sacrificed 1000 horses to Vasooki; that is Hea, the King of Serpents, at his great tempIe at Prayág,4 and every Hindoo tries to visit Vasooki, especially at his festival season, the Naga-panchami, for a bath at his sacred ghat in the Ganga: this is the most re-generating ablution which the sinner or weary pilgrim can have. Merudook was the eldest son of Hea, and as the planet Dil-gan his Spirit. Hea was primarily the Earth, and latterly the god of Rivers, Hearths, and Homes.5 All the Kaldian gods had apparently not only distinct signs but numbers attached to them. The veil of obscurity still hangs over many of these, though tablets and paintings on palaces may hereafter throw light on them; I have shown those only I feel certain regarding. THE MOON. In Kaldi the moon was Hur, rwh, “the white one,” or perhaps Hor, a hole or cavern, also Hurki, Sin, or Ser; in many instances it was male, bnt godlike gender is deceptive; and neither uniform nor continuous.

The Asyrian monarchs placed Sin on their right, and Shamas, her consort1 of Nineveh, on their left. The Hebrew called her Lebanah, hnbl “the pale shiner,” and Yareach, “that which makes a circuit,” or “walks majestically;2 it was thought she could ‘secrctly entice’ the heart, and the so-called monotheist Job said in a very peculiar way that he had resisted her, not allowing “his mouth to kiss his hand,” a signifcation which can only be understood by the mouth and hand being taken in their old euphemistic character, as we see in the two ancient coins, Figs. 4 and 7, Plate XIII. There the naked Isis and Horus or Harpokrates are seen kissing hands, the former, whilst on the lotus or “Moon-flower,” with an olive or other yoni-like leaf, and the latter with a wreath of upreared serpents and the dove on his baton. The moon, it is acknowledged, is the MENI of Isaiah lxv. 11, who with Gad or the Demon (no doubt, a Peor or Lingam which this prophet so hated) has “tables” or sacrifices prepared for him by these great phallic-worshipping tribes. In Pontus and Phrygia were temples to Meen, and Homer says Meen presides over the months,3 whilst in the Sanskrit Mina, we see her connected with the Fish and Virgin. It is not improbable that the great Akai-Menian race, as worshipping and upholding Sun and Moon faiths, were called after Meni, the moon. We often find her androgynous, but usually as Rhea, Selene, and Ceres; we have also “reaping moons,” “wine moons,” &c., but in all countries she is best known under this beautiful figure of the unveiling Queen of Heaven, of cruciform and lozenge, or yoni-shape, bearing her lord’s arms, the crescent, on the cone, standing on the horned one, and surrounded by the expressive terms, KAM-ION, interpretable from the Sanskrit as “Love,” and “Place of Fire.” Bryant gives her with the superscription JUNO SAMIA SELENITIS cum peplo sacro.4 She was “Luz, the almond-shaped one,” and Ishtar, the wife of NERGAL, “the crusher,” la-grn, Negag-El,5 and also Multa or Molidtha, “the one before the driving one,” whom Assyrians made Belat, Belta, and Beltis, and Herodotus Mylitta, though Mul, Be and Gul seem all to have been equi- valents.

Hindooism says that the moon, Soma, was turned into a female called Chandri—“the white or Silvery One”—by Siva, because he frequently discovered his wife Rohīnī in company with other gods; now this must have happened a very long time ago, as Chandra is a very old name in the East, and the “Silvery One” was common in Kaldia, when Mulita, Belat or Belta, was called par excellence “My Lady The Goddess.” There can be no qnestion that we have here the Moon with the Triform god and the worship of Fertility. I would ask the reader’s attention to these three important gems which Dr In-man gives us from the Babylonian researches of Lajard in his Culte de Venus. We have yet to interpret the Pelevi or other characters, but I think Love or Venus is the eight-rayed star between the two figures in Fig. 200, and in the medallion—Fig. 201, the small globe in beween the Sun and Moon, the latter being shown in both as the Cup and Yoni. Osiris and Isis are rudely depicted below. Lajard gives Fig. 201 from the Imperial library of Paris, saying it was found at Cnidus. Fig. 199 requires no expla-nation. The Triune is the object of worship, and the figure behind is the Arbela., and exactly like the old medieval form of the Holy Ghost.

It is as the lliuminator of Heaven and Fertilizer of Earth that he is the special God of Larsa or Larisa, Elazer, and Sipara of lower Kaldia; which Lars is no doubt that “wanton goddess,” Laz or Luz, {wl, “the loose one,” a common compound in Asyrian and Baby-lonian names. LARISSA is the female symbol, as the Penates is the male. It is the womb or citadel—the Arkos or Akropolis—the ark of the polis; Greek Lexicons tell us that Larissa is “a kind of kettle,” and if we turn to the corresponding word in Hebrew we find that Neksheth signifies the metal used for vessels, as brass and copper, but that it also means the basis of an article, the ground, Ge, or support, and also the Pudenda. Hence we see it simply means the Argha or vessel in which the polis is situated—the seat or ark of the Lingam in which we continually see the Serpent or Nachash, as passion, moving; see Fig. 42. p. 123, Vol. I. Nechash in He-brew is brass and the brazen serpent is the Nechhash Ne-chsheth. I have elsewhere shown that the Lares and Penates of Rome are still represented on many eastern home-altars by small sacred forms of Lingams and Yonis. We have yet to learn from cuniform records if Kaldians had the same stories of Sol being born in the winter in a cave, &c., as the early Magian and Mithraic lore teaches us. Macrobius, a very learned Roman writer of the fourth n.ud fifth centuries A.C.,1 tells us that from the earliest times all peoples said the sun was a god, who came forth as a babe from a cradle in a rocky tomb at the time the days begin to lengthen, and that all ancient races then displayed him as a babe in their temples, and directed that he should be so worshipped. This the historian calls “the infant of the Egyptian Mysteries,” and both he and Plutarch assure us that the goddess Sais was then held to exclaim, “this infant Sun is the fruit of my womb.” Macrobius states that the mysteries of Christ’s passion were just like those of the Phrygian Atys, and called the “Mysteries of Night,” because of the Sun’s triumph. over the Autumnal Scorpion; and so perfect appeared the parallelism to Justin, Tertullian, Fermicus, and others, that they said the devil had come and travestied their Christian rites so as to deceive men. We must remember the ancients thought that the annual age of the Sun was only nine months; while many, like the early Romans, only acknowledged as the beginning of the year his brilliant and vigorous spring rising—end of March, although all considered his birth in the depth of winter as a period to be revered and rejoiced over. The Asyrians called an Ark temple of the Sun Bet-Para, and as r = l, then 1 Macrobius was named Ambrosius and Theodosius, and if so, must have been a Christian. He wrote many works, and notably Saturnalia Convivis, Cicero’s Dream, &c. [Macrobius was a hack writer of the period of Roman decay; his works are essentially compilations. Saturnalia contains some useful information at third or fourth hand, but promotes a crude solar syncretism. — T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 65 Fig. 203.—SOL IN CONJUNCTION WITH LUNA.

The He-brew word is horp, Paroh, Prince or Leader, and the Koptic Pouro, “the king.” Pharis, F£rij, was with Greeks the Son of Hermes, and the King of Egypt, as Bunsen urges, “was not Phre but the son of Phre,”3 whom Rosselini and Wilkinson tell us “was the Sun god RA,” that is, he of Love or Connection, for Phre = P’RE or P’RA. From Para, “Day,” we readily obtain the cognate God Pur and Tor, the Fire and Tower, or, as Greeks called this, the Phar-os, a peculiarly Phallic emblem being a Tor rising out of the ocean or an Argha-like bay. We hence see the origin of such common Mesopotamian names as Si-para, San-para, or Sapavam, Heli-Ops (Sun-Serpent), and Heliopolis, the Sun-city where his stone of Sun-Standard, &c. is set up. The Sun in conjunction with Selene is commonly represented as here and before he departs from her we are to suppose that “water has flowed from his feet,” or that impregnation has taken place,4 and that the young Sun is that faint glow we so often see in the arms of the new Moon. The Mi-mi of 2 Kings is “fire-water,” and Mi is the Sun’s name and gold, on the seven notes of the musical scale,* and as already stated the name for fire in Barmese, Siamese, and cognate tongues. The Sun, son of Saturn, superseded his father, so Saturn’s day became sacred to the Sun, and also to him who, in the eyes of millions, has nearly superseded God himself. The planet Saturn is now called Kookab-Shabath “the Sabbath Star,” or Shabeti, ytbc, “Jah is Saturn,”5 and Ilion is Helios. The Jews of course only got their Sabbath from the Babylonians about 700 B.C.6, yet Sol’s day dates from time immemorial and was always a sacred and lucky one, especially with sailors. Sol or Bel mostly clung to Sipara, as Nebo to Bor- sipa and Hea to Hit; though, in the later days of Nebu-kadnezar, Bel, Merodak, and Nebo were called the gods of the capital, and Nergal or Mars the special tutelary god of the whole nation; these are more commonly met with on the cylinders than any other. Nebo, being the conical Mountain-god, was naturally the tutelary deity of the high cone of Borsipa or Birs-Nimrood, and there identical with the Sun, for this temple was his Ark—Bet-Tsidee or Sidi, 1 Parah, hrp, is a hole, pit, heifer, that which brings forth, and therefore feminine of Pal. 2 Josephus’ Antiq., VIII., vi. 2. 3 Bunsen’s Egypt, II., 14.

Bel’s special temple in Babylon was called Bit-Sagath; in Niferi Karis-Nipra both names recalling many associa-tions already touched upon; and in Sipara, Bit-Para, which may be here Pura, or fertile fire generally, or as already stated Bit Ph-Ra, or P’-Ra, “the house of the mouth of fire,” of either sex. Usually the temples are merely called after the popular name of the god, as Bit Anu, the temple of Anu, Bit Anat, the house of Ana or Anat, so that such a name as Bit P’Ra is very significant. But we must pass on, for volumes could be written on these subjects. GOOLA was the great Asyrian goddess and held to be the feminine energy of the Meridian Sun. She was worshipped all over the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates at least four thousand three hundred years ago, and especially so in the great cities of Sipara and Larsa or Larissa.1 She was the progenitor of all “Virgin Maries” and such ideas, and held in these old days a firmer sway than Mary does even now in Rome. Siparvites called Goola, ANA-Melek or “My lady Ana,” and she was Queen of heaven and chief god-dess of the Amaleks, those great Phallic and Tsabean worshippers whom orthodoxy correctly alleges in the Jewish Genesis, as existing some 2400 years B.C. As Ana-Melek or Anam-Melek, “Anam My Lady,” she was called the energy of “the glorious one” or “Fire-King,” who was then named Arda-Melek or “Adrammelek” to whom Si-parvites, as in duty bound, burned their children, and after whom King Senakerib named his son.2 This Ana is a well-known Koothic and Keltic goddess. All the most ancient Irish legends make her the mother of Tuath-di-Danaan, who in Western Asia may have beeh Toth-de-Knaan, and elsewhere Canaan, or perhaps Daran, Darian, or Dorian, for as elsewhere seen these Danaans were much mixed up with Dorians and their ways. Goola is usually represented by a star of six or eight rays. In the best known periods of Asyrian history, she was not such a favourite with the people as Ishtar or Venus, but always very much identified with the Sun himself for Kala is Gala or Goola and Siva as Kala, is the Sun.3 Gula or Goola was often called Bilat, Il, and Hoa. VOOL, IVA, AO, &c. This Deity is the least underatood of the whole Asyrian Pantheon, although the third person of that Trinity. Some European writers even cast doubt on the very name, though I think unreaaonably; those Hindoo friends I have consulted in regard to his history have never hesitated to declare him “Fire,” “Passion,” “Tortuousness,” or “the thunderbolt.” He is usually placed between the Sun and Moon, just as Venus the Planet is in Figs. 200-1, for she is Passion, Heat or Fire, and this is the most con-spicuous element in every Phallic Trinity. On the sacred official collar of the kings, Vool stands next to the Lingam, see Fig. 207, VIII, p. 77, and when he acts, he is the whirlwind of Passion which sweeps all before it in the world of animal and organic life. Iva or IOA is the uniting breath, AIR or HERA, which feeds Life; and we recognise Vool in 1 Anc. Mons. I. 162. 2 2 Kings xvii. 31; xix. 37. 3 Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.

This is Jupiter Mercury, or the SUN-MAN probably the base of Mard or Martiya (Persian) or Mardak, a man,2 for in Asyrian we have Mut or Moot a husband, equivalent to the Hebrew tm, Latin Maritus and Vir. Markand, or Martand, is a common Indian name for the Sun, as I pointed out in treating of solar temples in Kashmeer, &c. Merudook was called the tutelary god of Babylon, the “ever upright” and “advancing One;” perhaps meaning “protruding One,” as the placed him at their gates, and called him “the holder of the gates,” coupling him with Asher’s emblem. It is clear that he is the present Elājee of India whom I have described in Vol. I. p. 47, and that Babylon in all such matters was like our large Indian cities. The “holders of the Delta or Gate” are the bull and serpent,3 to whom the Egyptians in their entombing era added Cerberus; Merudook is therefore Siva, and talking the Kaldi words Mara, arm, “the Lord” or “High One,” and ]wd, Duk, he “pounds” or “beats,” it would seem he was a kind of Tor, the “Lord Bruiser,” or he with the hammer, words often applied to the Jewish and Babylonian deities.4 His Akadian name was Amardu.5 NERGAL was properly the Mars of Mesopotamia, and the peculiar and favourite god of Koothites. In Syria, we are told by Jews that Kooths made Nergal their god, and that he was a “lion among men,” that is, as the Indian Aryan would say, the Nara Singha or Man-lion Incarnation of Vishnoo the Sun. Even Shemites called Nergal, Aria, the Greek Ares, and we hence get at the root and the mistake of Jews who made out as already explained that the Sun, when in Ares, was the Agnus Dei. Nergal was shown in all respects like Nin, Fig. 195 p. 34, except that he was a lion and that is a man-bull. I will not dwell more on the gods in detail, out a few words as to ISHTAR or NANA,6 though fully treated of in other places. ISHTAR—I may state that all the author of Anc. Mons. writes in regard to these oId faiths thoroughly supports what I urge, though he is far from looking at their features as I do, for he clearly knows very little of Eastern Phallic faiths and their interpretation. Ashtoreth is Ishtar or woman, the Star in more senses than one; the Phenicians called her Astarte, but “the present Mendean form is Ashtar,” and the plural Ashtar-oth. Bunsen derives this repres.enmtive name from the very coarse, but I fear perfectly correct source, “the seat of the cone—Has and toreth;” for this is true to the 1 Anc. Mons. I. 164. 2 Persian. Anc.

(.)SemiramisShoami-Ramiidea of all Hindoos, and shows us that the terms “male” and “female” originally meant the organs pur et simple, which indeed the quasi-inspired writer of Gen. i. 27 ex-presses in the words Zakar and Nekabah, hbqnw rkz. In all African and Arabian dialects Nana and not Ishtar is the commonest terms for Mother, the usual initial being Ma, Ya, Ye, Ni, and rarely Om and On; see the long list of over a hundred names given by Sir John Lubbock1 as those of “the non-Aryan nations of Europe and Asia,” and of “East Africa.” There we see Ma and even Ama occasionally used for Father, perhaps because among some tribes the strange custom existed of his going to bed to protect and warm the infants as soon as born. The almost universal initial sounds for the male ancestor are, Pa, Fa, Ba, and in a few instances Da, and Ad, and once Od and Ta. In Asia Baba, Aba, Apa, and sometimes Ama, occur; now what we want above all things to know is the origin of these sounds, but here philology is silent with seemingly no power to ad-vance.2 This is not the cage, however, in regard to the objective roots of religions; here we work with reasoning creatures, and can see that the child continues, and that all mankind have ever continued to male and female forms, whether in their own kind or in their gods, the same A’s, P’s, F’s, D’s, to males, and M’s, N’s, Om’s, Y’s to females, and we therefore con-clude that these were man’s earliest symbols and names for the organs of sex, the Omphe or Mamma of the mother, which man had first cognisance of, and the A, Ab or Pa which he noticed as the characteristic of the opposite sex. The Asyrian often represented Ishtar as the upright fish, drawn like a naked female as this on the right, probably because of the immense fecundative powers of the fish and as the creature par excellence of water. The great mythic queen, Semi-ramis, wife of Ninus, the founder of Nineveh or Ninus, was said to have sprung from a fish some twenty-three centuries B.C., and to be representative woman, Eva of Mary. Let us pause for a moment over her history, regarding which there has been much controversy, ending in grave doubt as to whether there ever was such a person. I believe, however, in this half mythic Semiramis, and even in Oanes and Ionah or Jonah, in a Romulus and Remus, Mithras and Christ, although there is no “real history” nor anything approaching to true histo-rical evidence regarding these; still I would urge that they may be real historical characters, although substantial history regarding them is wanting. The mythic genealogy of SEMIRAMIS begins with a fish and ends as shown in mar-gin with Ninyas. Her mother was Dorketo, the Fish-Goddess of Askalon, in Syria, where she was worshipped as Astarte, or Aphrodite. She was famed down to the days of Augus-tus for her beauty, voluptuousness, virtues, and vices. There seems no doubt but that 1 Origin of Civil., pp. 284-288.  2 M. Müller’s Science of Lang., p. 373."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 69there was some ruler called Semiramis who conquered most of Western Asia, Egypt, and part of Ethiopia, and who attempted India. Her fish origin is simply due to her being a woman, and to her marrying On or On-es, or probably Oanes or Ho-Anes, the Serpent fish, or recognised God of Passion both on the lower Euphrates and the lower Nile. Her conquests may merely signify that the race who had faith in her con-quered, or that certain conquerors embraced the worship of the Sun Goddess. When Kaldia fell to Asyria, she was very naturally made to marry Ninus, or the strong Bull-Man which this name signifies; she was preserved by doves, or the God’s Spirit, and was finally taken up to heaven by doves, for these birds were sacred to Aphrodite. Mr. Rawlinson believes that the origin of the myth lies in Ivaloosh’s Queen of the eighth century B.C., who was possibly a Babylonian, and shared in the Government with her Lord, but there is little doubt that there was such a queen or goddess. Her name, if em-bracing Sun and fertilizing energies, would naturally be Swāmi or Sami (God), Rames, Rami, or Ramesi—the Goddess of the Sun, in fact Ishtar, which Wilford calls her,1 saying these names mean Isis. The Asyrian story is, that she sprang from a dove or Yoni, which Capotesi would signify, and this in the Indian manifestation. Semiramis or Sami-Rames worshipped obelisks, erecting one in Babylon 130 feet high, says Diodorus Siculus, and another at Ek-batāna, or rather on the rock of Bag-istān —“the place of God or Bagavān”—midway between Babylon and the Caspian, in Media Magna. On this mountain (1700 feet high) and two centuries before his time,2 Diodorus says that Isadore and Charax saw the pillar and statue in or beside a city, and he also describes the arrival of the Queen, her establishments, her gardens at foot of hill, and her engraving certain Asyrian characters on the scarped surface of the rock. The historian calls the hill Dios-Oros, “the hill of god” or the Sun, such as Jews called Horeb, and Armenians and Baktrians, Deva-Vend or El-wand. High up on the Bagistan or Behistoon cliffs we still see Asyrian, Persian, and Ars-ak-idian inscriptions of conquests, etc. OANES.—It is said Oanes was a man-headed fish, and the earliest Hermes or Mes-senger of God to Kaldia. Berosus says he ate not, yet taught all the arts of geometry, and the harvesting and storing of fruits and seeds. Every night he retired to the sea (the Female and Holy Spirit), and after him came Messiahs.3 Helladius called him Oes, but says he had the feet of a man, and sprang from a mundane egg, as 'Wj testifies. He had a fish’s skin, and Hyginus says he first taught astrology in Kaldia. The mother of Oanes was worshipped as Venus Atergates, “the good spirit,” and Oanes himself possibly signifies “the first-born of the Yoni,”4 the Protogonos of Sankuniathon.5 The Japanese represent their Messiah emerging like Vishnoo from a fish, and as such call him Kan-On or Kūan-On, and his temple, On-ius, and make his spirit repose on twelve cushions, just as they do in the case of Fo or Boodha, showing clearly the solar significance of the whole. So we see a close connection between the Kaldian 1 Higgins’ Ancalypsis, I., 352.  2 Anc. Mon., III. 31.

In Armorik, Oan and Oanie, and in Irish, UAN is a lamb, and in Hebrew Ionas signifies the gentle one “a Revealer,” or word from God, and a Dove, so that the sum of the whole points to the Sanskrit Yoni. Pan, Jove’s senior brother, used to be called “a whale-like fish,” and he entangled Typhon in his nets and caught him, and yet who so unlike a fish in chnracter as the goat-footed god. So Boodha is called Dag-Po, or Fish-Po; Vishnoo appears in the first Avatár as a fish, for he is Viçoo, Fiçoo or Fish-oo, as Christ is Ischa in Ireland, which is the Welsh Fischa. In all lands, Fish have proved the saviours of many men, and among fish, the Dolphin, as the Delphus or Womb. She who has dedicated her life to her god we call a Nun, and this with Hebrews is a fish, {wn, and the Yoni. Fish and birds were called in Asyrian Nunu-Itsuru, yet a fish spoken of in opposition to a bird was Ka, and a bird, Khu. Isis was a brooding bird, yet is generally seen with a fish on her head. The fish was the first to swallow up the genitals of Osiris, when Typhon caused him to be cut into pieces and thrown away. Eating fish was considered to induce venery even more than beef or garlic,3 and Shemitic races recommended or ordered such repasts on Frig’s Day, or Night—their Sabbath or Sabbath eve. Among the Druses of Syria, Layard assures us such matters are still carefully attended to on Venus’ or Frig’s eve, adding that “in secret vespers” these pious persons “offer a true worship to the sexual parts of the female.” Sir H. Rawlinson assures us, asj we might expect, that no changes, have been discovered between the earliest and latest faiths of Kaldia; all the tablets have tle same langunge, writing, and religion, and the same traditions are everywhere ob-served. Temples built in the earliest times received the veneration of successive generations down to the time of Shemitic Nabonides,4 when we hear of the Hebrew names of Aram, Haran (a connection of Asher’s), Padan Aram, Aram-Naharaim or Mesopotamia, applied to vast tracts, celebrated for peculiar conical hills, volcanoes, and sulphurous springs.5 These were the lands of the mythical A-Brā—Creator or Abram, a name his posterity would certainly have borne, as in India, but for phallic Seth or Shem. Every city bespoke the phallic faith, and even in the crumbled ruins do so still. Take for example Kala, whose once so famous tower dominated over a vast expanse of the Asyrian plains; if not called after Siya (Kála), it may well have been. Xenophon called Kala, Larisa, and said its tower reached to heaven; just as the Septuagint tells us Babel’s did, and frightenedthe Jewish Elohim so much that he went down to see what the Babylonians were about, and apparently knocked it down and dispersed the builders, of which very prominent and important occurrence we ought surely some day to find confirmation of on a tablet or cylinder. The inhabitants of the Zagros mountains or Highlands of Asyria, were from the 1 Book of God, pp. 305, 325.  2 Whiskey, or “Water of Life.” 3 The Skate was particularly sought after for such matters, perhaps, as the Ray, a fish which usually basks in the sun, and has a Sun-like circular disk. 4 Rawlinson’s Herod., I. 441.  5 Anc.

They were totally distinct from the dwellers on the plains, for Mr. Rawlinson clearly demonatrates that Babylonians and Asyrians were Shemites, not Aryans, and were hence the ancestors of Jews, that their language was analogous to Hebrew, and that they were in their way a highly religious people. He says they set up emblems of Asher (Maha-deva) wherever they went. Like the Jews, they dedicated much of their plunder to their gods, and they destroyed or took away the gods of the people they conquered. Both declared they fought for the honour of their god, and yet both set up the gods against which they had fought. Both delighted in cruelty and carnage. David “harrowed his enemies” as we do weeds, and in Asyria the prisoners were occasionally treated in a similar manner, but both Asyrians and Jews usually preserved women for themselves, their priests and God, though the latter doubtless implied the former. These poor victims of human passion learned to accomodate themselves easily to a change of home and master. Hebrews, Armenians, and Greeks constantly express their wonder at the vastness and beauty of the great buildings which covered these old empires, usually ascribing them to the very ancient races of Akadia and Kaldia, whose Patriarch most caIled Ninus, and later Patriarchesss, Semiramis. The first builders were probably the early Aithiopians, and if so, they here leamed their trade in a good school, and with easy material—the soft mud and cement of these delta lands; this was good practice for a race who were in after-times to astonish Europe with their great works in cut and un-cut stone. They were equally celebrated as carpenters during all Roman dominion. The Palace-temples and Tsabean towers of the old monarchies were similar in character and generally in materials to the Temple of Belus, which exaggeration has very nearly made mythical in the so-called “Tower of Babel.” I will here try and state, from the best authors, the facts concerning this religious structure. It was the greatest temple or building of Kaldia, and was dedicated to Bel, Ba-El, Ba-al, Pal, or P’Al, or as later peoples called this, Belus—the Sun, in his active or fructifying capacity. It was a correctly oriented shrine, composed of tower upon tower, each about 60 feet high, and located in a square enclosure of some 30 acres in"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 72extent. Its base was a square of rather more than 200 yard on each side, from which rose eight square stages to a total height, as now generally accepted, of 480 feet. It was a pyramid like this Fig. 205, and built of sun-dried, or perhaps, in part, of partially baked bricks, cemented with mud, reeds, and bitumen. If the stages were equal in height, each must have been, as here, upwards of 60 feet high. So far as appears, the upper stage, on which was a shrine of the Sun, was solid, but the seven lower tiers must have been pierced at all events for the stair, which seems to have been run up the outside of the upper stage. It was perhaps intended to fill up the steps of the lower tiers, as we see in the case of most Egyptian pyramids. Strabo makes the total height 606 feet, and calls it “the tomb of Belus,”1 but it was really a shrine dedicated to all the “Host of Heaven,” but especially to “Bel the Fertilizer.” It had various seats or resting-places in the ascent, and all the tiers were dedicated to the seven favourite planets, and coloured as these are traditionally held to be. Thus, the first tier above the basement was called Saturn, and coloured black; the second, Jupiter, coloured orange; the third, Mars, was reddish; the fourth, Venus, was besmeared yellowish with sandal, that perfumed wood with which women powder their persons; the sixth was Mercury—the blue god, Siva or Bodh; the seventh was the silvery Luna, and the column on the summit was the golden ray of Sol, which “was crowned,” says Diodorus, up to at least the sixth century B.C., by a glorious shrine, containing the three colossal images of Bel, Beltis, and Rhea, by which, I suppose, is meant Zeus, Ceres, and Proserpine, for ordinarily Beltis, Rhea, and Ishtar are but different names for the Queen of Heaven. “Before Bel stood two golden lions, and between Bel and Beltis were two enormous serpents of silver, each 30 talents in weight.” There was a golden table 40 × 15 feet in front of the three statues, on which stood two great cups, as heavy as the serpents. Beside these were three drinking cups, and two censers. Herodotus says that 1000 talents weight of frank-incense was here offered annu-ally at the festival of Bel. In his time there was a shrine at the base, which contained a sitting image of Bel made of pure gold, and there was a table in front of it, with a stand also of gold, which it is believed the Persians had plundered.2 The upper shrine had no image, but only a table and handsome couch covered with drapery, which barren women often frequented in order to obtain offspring. All the symbolism here is what we should expect in a shrine to Siva and Parvati combined. Fertility was clearly the object, and all too practically solicited from the priests, and graphically illustrated in Māya’s great yawning cups wreathed with passion. Rhea and Ishtar were the tutelary goddesses of Babylon, and here they are shown as waiting on the fecun-dator and fecundatrix. No wonder the Jewish Jahveh is represented as saying in the case of so unique and grand a temple, “Let us go down and see what they are doing,” but our translation of Gen. xi. 4 in regard to the words “whose top may reach unto heaven, is not only erroneous, but shows obtuseness or worse in regard to the actual meaning of a phallic tower or column, and especially so as to the summit of the Meroo, “whose top is dedicated unto heaven,” that is to Juno, Hera, 1 Bohn’s Ed., 1857, III, 145. A Tomb is an Ark or Cave. 2 Compare Anc. Mons., III, 343."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 73Air, or the feminine principle,1 for this pyramid was the Kaldian Meroo. So again, we are blinded in the English translation of the next line, “let us make us a name;” it should be “a Shem,” or “the sign,” or “signal,” as Cahen’s Hebrew Bible translates \\c into the French. meaning “a standard,” Nissi or Nishān of the god. The race built “the Shem” in Shinar, and after describing it proceed to tell us “these are the generations of Shem” (verse 10), so that a phallic column was the usual and appro-priate symbol of their demi-god, the elder son of Noh, and forefather of the race. I believe the ultimate meaning and foundation of the word is from Shams, the sun, in his fertilizing capacity, and we know that in the adjoining plain of Dura, nearly 1700 years later,2 when there was no lack of knowledge and learning on the part of the leaders of a great vietorious empire, the king and people erected a Sun-Stone or Phallus 90 feet high and 9 feet in breadth (probably average breadth), and required princes and people, vassals and slaves, to go and worship before it.3 It must have been very similar to the great Lochmuriakir shaft of Bretany, which will be seen in this Plate IX., 12, though somewhat longer. We see from the name of the plain on which the great temple was built that all here was sacred to Sol, for Shinar=Shanar=Shan, the Sun, and Ar=Al=God; Ar in Hebrew is “Lion,” and so we have Ares for Mars, the very masculine and activc form in which the Sun was worshipped in Kaldia, and in Egypt as Am-On. Aran is the Hebrew for a wild goat as well as for “a beam” or “a rnast,”4 whilst Aras signifies “to erect,” “to long for union.” In Greek Erōs is the “God of Love or Desire,” and the Hebrew points to this source when it says hwro, Erva, is the pudendum of both man and woman, and therefore the four objects or Arba-el, although I see no necessity to go to the Aramaik for Arba, “Four.” The word Ar-ba is but Ar-Ab, or the male Triune Father, and seeing that Erva signifies the organs of both sexes, the Ar-ba-el is clearly the united or four organs, and therefore in ancient ideas and nomenclature, a fourfold Deity of Fertility. Or=A.r in Hebrew, so Am-Or, or Ham-Or—rwmh,5 means “the dark red,” or “swelling up one,” “sudden in rising,” also “an ass,” as notoriously salacious, and to whom, on this account, Tacitus likened the Jews, calling them “projectissima ad libidinem gens;”6 see Onolatria in my chapter on Hebrews. The Arabs still call the Babylonian plain Shin-Iar or Shan-Iar, that is, Sun-god, for in the oldest Keltic, as well as modern Drnvidian Tamil, I-AR is God; even in Arabic he was the Zu-piter of the groves. Am-on, Mars, and Jove wera all symbol-ised by a Ram, and Sir William Drummond tells us that the Kaldian appelation for the sign Ares or Mars was “a young ram,” or lamb, and Aries was Agnus, in Egypt called Amon or Ham-On, and by Hebrews Amor, all having the significiation of Love7 1 Ether, rto, was one of the second Asyrian Trinity, colleague of the Sun and Moon, and corre-sponding to the heavenly Eve, Iva, Er, Vool, &c. 4 This is one of the meanings of Nis-rok, the eagle-headed god, who is often seen fighting with the Asyrian bull. 2 Tower of Babel = Obelisk of Dura = According to Orthodoxy = 2246 550 —— 1686 B.C. ,, yrs. 3 Daniel iii, 1-7. 5 Gen. xxxiii. 19. 6 Hist.

Fire, and therefore named very properly “The Lamb of God.” So in the case of Am-Orites, who were so called after their deity, we observe that they dwelt on Mount Heres of Aijalon, or Heres (Sun) of the Ram—all terms denoting the Sun. Now as he or Apollo is represented in the Serpent, we see why these old Kaldians called him Arad or Ar-vad—syllables which remind us of two important terms of Deity and father-hood; so the stars of the sign Scorpio (sign of Dan) they called Ak-ra-bhim, placing them opposite Taurus. It is now held by the best critics that the whole passage from Gen. x. 32 to xi. 9 is an interpolation of a later age than the Elohist narrative, pro-bably inserted in order to try and account for variety in of language. But to return to the tower. Within the enclosure of the temple of Belus were two altars, one of gold for the more precious votive offerings, and another, probably of stone, for sacrifices, and of course there were poles and pillars with serpent streamers and gorgeous banners; beautifully carved or otherwise ornate pavilions—gilded for Sol and silvered for Luna —so arranged as to afford shade and protection to the numerous priests, attendants, and worshippers; nor would such a shrine be without hoses for the women, nay, nor for the loathsome Kadeschem. One account tells us that on the high summit of the tower there was a colossal right hand of the Almighty ANU,1 which is an invariable sign of Siva, still well-known in the East. We often find it engraved thus on sacred stones at village gate-ways, or in an open sort of trysting place in the village, or a sacred grove. This is a sketch of one which I have frequently observed. The Youthful dancers are clearly plighting their troth before the budding “Tree of Life” (veiled as Siva’s “hand”), and in full presence of Sol and Luna, and asking for marriage favours from the Upright God. Mr. Isidore Heath thinks that it may have been from seeing this great right hand of the Almighty on the Babylonian—perhaps we should say the Borsipa temple, as that high mound is thought by the best critics to have been its site—that captive and wandering Jews were led to speak so much of “the right hand of Jahveh.” These and all ancient, and indeed most modern people, attach much importance to holding up of hands in adoration, or when blessing; see Moses, whose hands had to be sus-tained else his tribe would have been conquered by Amelekites. Most easterns connected heaven with “seven stages.” Warka had a famous “tower of the seven stones,” and seven is a sacred number alike with Jews and Christians, which they have inherited from the followers of Anu and Belus. Zechariah has evidently the idea of the planetary hues and stages in his mind when he speaks of the seven eyes of the deity running “to and fro through the whole earth,” for others than this Jew held the planets to be the eyes of God. The “headstone” of Zerub-Babel’s temple (note the solar name) is Christ, say Christian commentators, but a Jewish Messiah yet expected, say the Jews;2 nevertheless, this builder who gloried in the name of the place of his birth—“he of 1 Phen.

Bible, Zechariah iv."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 75Babel” (lbbrz) had here a shrine very full of solo-phallic emblems, as when he speaks of a gold candlestick carrying “a bowl upon the top” of it, as is not the custom of candlesticks, but of Siva and Osiris (see my Pl. XIII, 13), and having on each side of the shaft an olive tree, which we all know to be a feminine, round, and fruitful oil-yielding tree, and used generally in contradistinction to the conical and upright pine or cypress —male symbols. The same idea is expressed in Fig. l, Pl. V., p. 104, Vol. I., where, at the base of the strange shaft—here the vagina, we observe two sheaves, or bunches of corn. Great exertions have been made from time to time by orthodox churchmen to substantiate what Mr. George Smith, in his late writings on the records of Babylon, calls that “most obscure incident in the book of Genesis, the building of the tower of Babel.” He says that it has been usually asserted that Berosus confirmed the Biblical record, but that that this is an entire (I fear not unwitting) mis-statement on the part of Bib-licists. Mr. Smith thus summarizes the results of all his researches amidst Asyrian ruins on the Tigris, and in the vaults and libraries of the British Museum: “So far as we can judge from the fragments of his copyists, there was no reference to it (the Biblical story of the tower) in the work of Berosus, and early writers had to quote from writers of more than doubtful authority, in order to confirm it. There is also no representation on any of the Babylonian gems which can with any certainty be described as belonging to this story.”1 This statement, by a most orthodox member of the Biblical Archeological Society, and on this particular subject perhaps the best authority on the staff of the British Museum, and put forth in a volume expressly devoted to the substantiation of the Jewish Genesis, seems to settle the question. Mr. Smith here also gives us all he can glean as to pillar or tower-building in Baby-lon, and this consists of some men rubbing or anointing small columns which strike me as Lingams, or Lion pillars. Two have lions on them, whilst the persons engaged anoint-ing—that is worshipping—have Sri-Lingams and horns on their heads, which shows they are Kentauri or priests of tribes worshipping Kubele, &c. (see p. 171 Fig. 207, x.) One stands between two budding or fruitful mounts, as we very often see in the case of Siva or Agni—the flaming God. There is a closed sistrum, Yoni, or “Tree of Life”-like object behind him—surmounted by a star, and with a male triangle at its base; whilst in front is the open double triangle, through which runs a shaft, bearing a brilliant seven-rayed star. A similar shaft, carrying a Lingam or fruit extremely like the male Triad, is shown betwixt one of the columns and its builder or anointer. My Figure is only part of the sculpture, which Mr. Smith gives us in more detail.2 I should here mention that when the above was going to press, I observed in this writer’s last work a statement that he has discovered a fragment of a cylinder on which it is written, that because the people were wicked they were “scattered abroad” and “confounded” (!), and that “a strong place,” which they built up in the day, “the father of the gods” (who was of course Anu, not Jahveh) pulled 1 Chaldean Account of Genesis, p. 158.

Thi is only important inasmuch as it shows us on what very fragile foundations Ezra, his scribes and successors, probably constructed the “very ob-scure incident” of “the tower of Babel,” and so launched upon the sorely perplexed philological world the theory of the magical creation and dissemination of languages. The real facts which the tablets seem to be unfolding are, that one sect tried to raise a solo-phallic temple, and others to pull it down (very much what we are still doing, at least theoretically), whilst many “great mounds” were thrown up in mere defence against Elam or Soosa, and as soon as raised, destroyed or pulled down by the enemy. The scattering abroad of the tribes was always a common device of monarchs, on the principle of “divide and conquer.” It is clear that no tower which was nightly thrown down can have any reference to the Jewish Babel column, which “reached unto heaven.” Mr Smith has so far forgot the office of the mere translator of the cuniform here, as twice to use the words “confounded their speech,” but further on he confesses that he has “never seen the Asyrian word with this meaning,” and that he has only translated it “speech,” on account of “a prejudice,” I suppose, to establish if possible the truthfulness of the Biblical text, so my readers will see that every effort has been made, but without avail (some may justly think even beyond the bounds of strict historical writing),1 and by the most orthodox translators, to substantiate the Jewish sacred records, and the reading of Genesis xi. 1. It is very probable that the “dispersion” and consequent dissemination of languages, arose out of a religious war which drove the great early builders—Kuklops, Aithiopians, Kooths, &c., out of the valley of the old rivers, to the Aram, or highlands and coasts of Phenicia, where they got their later names, Kanaans, &c., and were variously looked upon as gorgons, giants, Kabiri, Kentaurs, &c., and men of the Phin, P’in, or one horn as in these Kaldian sculpturings. Ezra the Jew hearing of this great Kaldian shrine only through the mit of some twenty long dark centuries, and from tablets which, if accessible to him, he could not decipher, may well be excused for so crystallizing and passing on to his tribe as he did, the wild and impossible tales which it is averred, however, were written in the fifteenth centnry B.C. Indeed we have something approaching to “evidence” in favour of my hypothesis; and evidence, too, showing that Kaldian peoples were about this time broken up and “scattered abroad” “because of their wickedness.” Brynnt says that one reason amongst others why Kuthites were utterly extirpated from Babylonia, was because they seized their neighbours and sacrificed them to their gods, and hence the poet says they were overthrown and driven into Tartarus, which, after all, however, meant only the lands in which we now dwell comfortably enough; for this Tartaros was Ades, the West, or Europe, which last then meant the cold, wet, and unknown black forests of the Danube, the Rhine and their affluents. Tartarus was held to be a great pool, Erebus, darkness, and perhaps the Atlantic, for poor expatriated ones were often known to put off from the coasts of Europe into “the great unknown land,” and so reach our 1 His actual words are, “I have translated the word ‘Speech’ with a prejudice.”"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 77own and other isles. The Irish have a tradition that such races emigrated to Erin from Tethgris, possibly Tigris, but this will be treated of in a future chapter. No doubt human sacrifices prevailed among all Kuklopians and Kooths, of course to the god and goddess of procreation, who in the act of creation (as I hope to show hereafter, if I can procure original and sufficiently veiled statuettes) do also “destroy in order to make alive.” We are told that “wherever these peoples founded any place of worship and introduced their rites, there was generally some story of a Serpent.”1 Nor have their old hands yet forgot the old faith, for we read the other day that some English travellers failed to induce the Arabs—Moslems though they be, to kill a most destructive snake in the neighbourhood of the Syrian Highlands.2 Let me here introduce to the reader’s notice a very important. group of ancient sculpturings, paintings, &c., and cxplain them, as they bear upon much already, and yet to be, said. Most of them will be found in the various museums of Europe, especially the British collections of Kaldian and Asyrian sculptures and paintings, and also in such special works as Mr. George Rawlinson’s valuable repertory Ancient Monarchies, and Mr. George Smith’s works3 which the reader should consult for fuller details.

Numbers 6 and 7 make the incense vase-idea very clear, but the Scorpion men leave us in no doubt as to what they are adoring. Their persons—half Scorpion—denote that Sivaism is pytho-phallic; their conical hats are undisguised phalli, reduplicated by the prominent central horn of the Kentaur or mythic Unicorn—a pure phallus and here no natural emblem, but one we still retain like the crown and prism so prominently dispIayed as elsewhere shown at our coronations. Notice here also that “The Eternal One,” he who alone can bestow fertility, is overhead pouring down his effulgent rays on the phallic censer, and stretching forth his Crozier horns or hands as he is never seen doing except over the organs of reproduction—“the Tree of Life,” or budding phallic column, &c., see pages 199, 200, 213, &c., Vol. I. Fig. 6, if taken by itself and only in in this or very similar forms,1 might lead us to the conclusion that only sacred censers were intended, which indeed I used to think, till the continued and often strange recurrence of this forms at the centres of all worship, and the fact that this faith never admits a form, line, or dot, without a mean-ing, and also that they more especially only symbolised the Glans, see Figs. 87, and 88, p. 206-7, forced upon me the conclusion that if these censer tops were first only made in this shape because of its sacredness, they in time came to be worshipped as here because of their shape. It was customary to set the sacred symbols upon stands as those seen in 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus on one side of an altar table is a Lingam cone on a high pedestal, being anointed by two females, not “unbearded men” as some say, or by a man and woman, one being sometimes seen with the mystic bag. On the altar table Maya or Luna is represented in the sacred boat or cup, Fig. 1—parent of our Chalice—and the Creator by a glow or halo of rays (very applicable to Asher) which always looks to, or sheds itself towards the phallus or chief emblem; see Fig. 194 heading this chapter. On the other side of the altar we observe two poles generally wreathed with streamers or serpents carrying the solar and probably lunar disks, the one rising from a round barrel, or ark-like stand and the other from a square pediment. Mr. Rawlinson rightly describes the whole as a “camp altar,” and my readers will find a great deal of interesting matter regarding these and similar emblems if they consult the writings of this historian quoted at foot.2 The same phase of worship, viz., that of the glans, was customary in Greek and Roman days; in Fig. 208 I give a drawing of two Grecian women going to worship it precisely as in ancient Kaldia and as is done now all over India. The worshippers have usually each a tray of flowers and spices, &c., on which may be seen little silver and brass cups containing these, sweet oils, or other unguents; they are respectfully holding back their flowing garments as is the custom, and one strictly incumbent on all female worshippers, for it would be a heinous sin and great misfor- 1 Anc.

The glans here is the usual Pine Cone, such as the Serpents are seen so excited before in the Pom-peian pictures.1 This Fig. 208, now in the British Museum and seen in Smith’s Clas. Dic under the head Canephoros, is quite misunderstood in Europe; most writers describe the worshippers as “Canephori approaching a candelabrum!” Sometimes Fire takes the place of the phallus on the stand, as in Fig. 207, iii., but some call this a Lotus, though I think it is rather Vool. The meaning would be the same, viz., “Fertility,” but seeing that men go toward it in wor- ship,2 I believe it is Fire. Let us continue an examination of the ancient cities and their symbolism. Korsabad was another important city, with a temple and tower like Kala. It occupied a very ancient site on the River Kaus, where this passes the end of the Maklaoh Hills, some eighteen miles nearly due north of ancient Nineveh. Mr. Layard believes that the name is from “Khosroes—his abode.”3 The great edifice, which M. Botta about 1845 here partially exposed, is held to be the palace of Esarhadon or Senakerib. The principal mound was found to contain a tower of seven stages, while Bira Nimrood had only one stage. Xenophon said it was two hundred feet high, and Ctesias asserted that it was more than a mile, but it is clear we have yet to discover the stadium of the latter. In the basment of these lofty shrines was the very holy cell, or chamber of the God, precisely as this is still seen in many very sacred Lingam temples in India. The cell “corresponded to the Greek Pronaos,” and was so arranged that persons passing by the outer doorway were unable to catch a sight of the shrine.4 The entrance was guarded by lions or bulls, or semi such, as we observe in the case of many Hindoo and other temples. The animal or Gorgon is such as the faith most loves or fears. Even the shrines of Boodha, Confucius and Laotsee have similar alarming figures, “to frighten away the sceptical.”5 In pure phallic faiths these objects exemplify some attribute of the deity, as virile power and passion, and Asyria pourtrayed these in very diversified forms, as in “Trees of Life,” of canopies of upreared hooded serpents, thought to set nature in a blaze, or, as in this sculpture, Fig. 209 where two winged bulls excited 1 See Vol. I. p. 32 ante, and Gall and Gandy’s Pomp.

The Maha-Deva or Devi of Akadia was called Nambaru or Sakba—probably Sakti or Yoni, and in Asyrian Mamit or Mamita, “The One God,” see Trans. Soc. Birch. Arch.

Fig. 211.—PHALLIC HAT AND ORNAMENTS OF ASYRIAN KINGS. to madness kneel before and butt the emblem. It requires little but practical acquain-tance with Sivaites to read these pictures, which accounts for European writers giving us them without a word of comment.1 Babylon, Aysria, and Egypt, all freely borrowed figures and ideas from one another, as I believe future discoveries will yet more fully prove, and it was most natural that peoples with similar faiths should do so. That we have not seen this more clearly is because writers on these nations have not recognised the close kinship of Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions; now Rawlinson points out that “the earliest specimens of Asyrian art are most un-Egyptian in character,”2 and that the adoption of Egyptian symbols probably took place in Sargon’s time, or 700 B.C. We find in Nimrood heads of Isis exactly like those of Mary or Maya, given in Vol. I. page 45, only in place of the stars are Yonis or lozenges encircling a very oval head and moon-shaped face. There are many other modes of delineation, beautiful as well as coarse, like this celestial mother and babe of Kaldia and Asyria, which is very similar to many little idols still found throughout India.3 A Yoni head-dress is meant to denote passion or fertility, and so we find the robe of Indra—Jupiter Pluvius, similarly adorned, and strangely enough, even that of the ascetic Boodha, see also the Egyptian Fig. 7. Pl. v., vol. I. The very peculiar “Pestle and Mortar” (as it has been called), head-dress of Amon, with its shepherd’s or bishop’s crook—perhaps a serpent—is probably a development of the Asyrian king’s official helmet, which I give here. It very forcibly reminds me of some of the coarser Lingams we see in India, and is re-duplicated, a common circulstance in this faith; the upper portion being a clear section of the Linga-in-Argha. Rawlinson shows us that both crook and radi-ating crest commonly denoted “soliders of the sun,” acknowledging a symbolism which he does not, however, follow up to its legitimate source. That we may here make no mistake, I will repeat these figures, which appeared on page 185, and consider further the details.. The radiating sun helmet—last of second line Fig, 212, is still in use for our Dragon or Dragoon regiments, and the first Tatar, or rude-looking Central Asian hat, is the precise “coloured terra-cotta-cone” which, together with lozenge4 or yoni-like patterns, Rawlinson tells us was “the favourite external ornament for houses.” 1 Anc.

We have many good instances in Mr. Rawlinson’s volume2 of hats denoting profession, sect and status, thus we see a person of rank with Isis’ horns and an open hand, whom we rightly con-clude (as we would in India) to be a Sakti, Yonite, or worshipper of Doorga, while another is a king or great one, with a phallic and sun head-dress, admiring a crux ansata or open-hand (Siva), which he holds in front of him, and so we call him a Sivaite. The musician’s hat was a fish with its tail uppermost; the common priest’s hat a simple cone, but of very considerable dimensions. All these have been found in Koyunjik, that large northerly lingam-like mound of Nineveh, now called Armous-heea, and adjoining which is the so-called “tomb of Jonah,” only called so because some ignorant Chris-tians here built a chapel,3 and called it after that very mythic saint, being igorant of the meaning of IONA. The development or growth of the Phallic-hat idea is very apparent if we examine all the figures and sects in detail. The first here is the plain Tatar phallus, the second re-duplicates with an obelisk, the third adds a circle—possibly yoni and fire pyramid, the fourth is what India calls “the complete figure,” for it is a column in a cup, on an olympus or omphe; the fifth slightIy veils all objccts, as when Siva stands upholding Luna at Somnāt, and then the decent period intervenes, which has succeeded in nearly hiding the faith from all save its votaries. In the West this culminates in such objects as our kingly crowns, or in the highly ornate top—a pine cone, still the top of the Bacchic Thyrsus, which I place last of the above figures. The radiating tiara with crosses (found on the headband of the Babylonian Bacchus), and the high hat with stars, mark the complete dominance of Solar faith. Of “the spear and tuft” I have elsewhere spoken; it was man’s earliest, and probably grossest idea. Skuthians so symbolised their Creator, and Romans did much the same in their Quirinus and his Quiris; javelins and spears wherever occuring in ancient rites in-variably represent the Phallic God, Fertilizer, or all attribute of Fertility. The Phallic crux ansata or Onk—“the symbol of life,” is very common in Kaldia and Asyria. It is twice prominently given as the seat and base of power in the cele-brated ivory panel of Nimrood,4 and is clearly and everywhere as much a sceptre or badge of dominion, marking a great god or patriarch, as are the king’s or priest’s head-dresses the mark of their offices and faith. In the centre of this ivory panel 1 Anc. Mons., II. 203.   3 Layard, I. 22. 2 Ibid., I. 133, II., 99, 244.   4 Anc.

We see four cruces ansatæ suspended from this head of the Asyrian Goddess, who has here horns like Isis, on which rest three globes carrying three vase-like forms of the Bood-hist Dharma or Trinity which bud forth into three Fleurs-de-lis. Notice the strictly Egyptian form of the head-dress,1 and also that in Egypt woman is hieroglyphically represented as the kneel-ing figure holding the cross or symbol of life, see W., Fig. 73, page 191 of Vol. I. The worship of the Asyrians, I think, was pre-eminently that of Venus—Vishnooism rather than Sivaism; the very name of the Pala-dium—Mamitu or Sakba,2 probably Sakti, and early Moon worship seems to denote this. We have numerous terra-cotta figures from Asyria, see Fig. 84, Vol. I., p. 205, and others, prominently displaying Sakti worship. These go by the general name of Venus or Kun, she whom Jews defined as “Kiun your God.” In the British Museum we have a bas-relief from Soosa of “a naked Kun” holding in her hands the Argha in the same manner as the Hindoo Devis usually do, if not of the Sivaik type; for we very rarely find Parvati naked, only the Vish-noo and Krishna goddesses, especially Krishna’s wife, Radha. I am not aware that the Lingam and Yoni have been found in conjunction on Asyrian remains; such Lingams as I have seen were principally charms, at all events juvenile, and not like the usual Indian objects of worship; I therefore think the Empire, at the period of which we have remains, were Yonites, nevertheless we may not yet know the truth in these matters, our discoverers and historians being so extremely modest. What would the history of Europe be, devoid of Mary, the Logos, the Dove, and “the Gospel of the Circumcision.” Let us dwell a little on their representatives in the old empires, for we everywhere recognise an Apollo, Creator and Venus. In this Egyptian Kiun, Fig. 214, riding Passion, and holding two snakes and budding flowers,3 we are re-minded of the Asyrian King praying in state, and also standing or treading on a Tiger or Leopard, as in this Fig. 215. The King is the representative of God, the bearer of the Sun, in which lies the mystic six-rayed star of love; and all his postures, as well as rights, are those of a God, one of which—Le droit de Seigneurs, a marital one—we have already stated is not yet obsolete.

So Kubele or Cybele is transported about only by Lions—those symbols of royalty from the Nile to the Ganges. The priestly kings of Anaradapoora, in Ceylon, and Solomon of Judea alike loved lions,4 but the chariot of the Venus of Skands was drawn by Cats. If the Queen of Heaven was well and continually represented, no less so was the God of Day, though rarely symbolized by a mere Lingam. In Asyria, Shems or Duian-Nisi was the holder of the bow and darter of the arrow, the Dainu-Tsiri or Supreme Judge,5 he who passes through the circle of life, and not only darts forth arrows to quicken all creation, but who softly sheds his rays on the just and the unjust. He has here as usual the characteristic hat; elsewhere he is promi-nently represented as a phallic god passing through his aerial path, as on “the tomb of Cyrus,”6 where he holds in his hands the two organs of creation, and travels, as a winged god, on a winged sun; and as if this were not clear enough, a Yoni is placed in front of him, and a crux ansata behind, while the solar orb appears close to his high conical hat. We see a very similar idea in the national “Banners” of Babylon and Asyria, and these official symbols are at all times valuable aids in the comprehension of a national faith, although in our days of intellectual free-thought one would scarcely arrive at a correct idea of the faith of educated England from “the red cross banner,” or “St. George and the Dragon.” A foreign enquirer would, however, even here not altogether misjudge the great mass of the lower middle class, if he said that they were highly super-stitious and credulous, and still followed the teaching of the successors of St. George, and honoured their belief and church. I give here the best known Asyrian Nisi or Standard, in which all emblems and “Passion” are depicted on an upright pole. Of course there are many others with additional insignia, though this seems to depict quite enough to allow us the symbols of deity which the cohorts worshipped and fought under; it deserves the most careful attention, 1 1 Kings xi. 5-33.

As Bellerophon (Bel-Ar-ophis, “My Lord, the Solar Python”), a man on horseback is usually seen over the “Shedder of light” with a skull and knife in hand, and instead of the seed in centre of the orb (Fig. 188, Vol. I., p. 509), a man passing through it. Now Siva is the Sun, and holder of the knife and skull—creation and death, for he tramples out life during the act of creating, and I have before me a very curious sample of this Deity in the act, which I will here describe although I hope to present it to my readers in a plate in my Chapter on Hindoo Faiths (it is given on p. 454). SIVA.—The figure is well executed in fine brass, set with small jewels, and has on the head, wavy tapering hair meant to represent Agni or Passion as consuming the God. His head (the phallus) has passed through a female who is spread out as it were over his body, her head with dishevelled hair lies by his waist and one leg and arm is on his chest; the lower part of his person is composed of an aqueous monster, half-turtle, half-frog, whose head appears behind the God’s right arm, which is upraised, and holds a sceptre, the head of which is a royal crown like that of England, see page 77, ante; the shaft is embedded in the Concha Veneris. The downward left arm to the elbow, forms an evident phallus, and in the left hand is a casket, symbolizing the womb, ark, or Bhāg. The left foot of the God, is firmly pressed into the reclining figure of a nude female which forms his pedesta1, and, as the Hindoo would say, the foundation on which creation rests, for this foot in the Yoni, supports the whole great figure of the Creator, another incontestible proof of what I elsewhere urge as to the double entendre of this limb with all ancient peoples—Jews as Gentiles. The other foot is upraised over the phallus, as so commonly seen in all Hindoo sculptures and paintings. The Sun is often depicted by the Sacred Skarib or Beetle, with quaint outspread sort of wings and tail, if male, and with a brond expanded and seat-like form, if female; and with these objects will be frequently seen open hands, circles and crescents. As Bel, “the Irradiator,” the Sun is seen with rampant figures, half-man and half-bull,2 crosses, cups, and Yonis; very suggestive triune figures have the three objects above an horizon line and a fan of rays as fertility below, are called emblems of him and of Asher. The European world has had much controversy as to what these emblems really mean, though whether with or without the male in the circle or even the wings, no Hindoo whom I have ever consulted has failed to recognize the Deity at first sight, and has usually described him as “El Shadai,” or “El the Shedder,” a Jupiter Pluvius, he who promised progeny and existed long before Jahveh.3 The Septuagint truly calls him “God Almighty,” or El Omnipotens, and this I hold, is the 1 Anc.

Indra-ic or Hindoo form under which the Almighty Sun-god was worshipped by Kaldians, Babylonians, Asyrians, Soosanians, Medes, and Persians; all acknowledged him of the circle, rays and wings. The author of “The Five Ancient Monarchies” admits that there is the most “striking resem-blance between the Pantheons of Greece and Rome and Kaldia,” yet he totally fails to see in their Faiths the de-velopment of a far wider and more powerful one than all the “Book-faiths” of man put together. In the later days of the Western Em-pire we find the Persian sculpturing the Sun on his rock temples as a vast semi-globe supported by nudes with a winged Apollo seated on it, worshipped by man, and surrounded with all the creative emblems. Agni, the Fire-god, bursts from a pillar, under Luna or Sol, on the right, and adjoining the Lingham; while IO the heifer is on another pillar beside “the man of god” on the left. I give this sculpture,1 which some call Baal-Berith or Jupiter Fœderis, “Lord of Covenants,” he before whom all must bow,2 and to whom the god in turn promises all the blessings of fertility, manly vigour, &c., as Jahveh promised to his worshippers.3 In one of the Asyrian gems which Layard gives us in his large Plate 69 , we see the winged god with the Yoni form of Luna above him, and two arms reaching down to earth, protecting the Pillar god and the Triune, here a javelin with side bosses. In Layard’s Plate 3 we see the priest with the usual extraordinarily developed phallic hat4 presenting the very symbolic citron fruit, whilst ornaments such as a radiated solar couch, upreared and winged serpents sitting on poles, and adoring emblems like suns and enormous acorns in their cups, are common. Now we must not forget in looking at these advanced pictorial forms of the Faith of the ancient Empires as symbolized by their learned ones on Palaces, Towers, and Tombs, &c., of kings and nobles, that these give us far too exalted an idea of the faith of the masses who thronged the vast plains and swamps of the great rivers, and the ad-joining rugged heights, and lofty highlands in the north, east, and west, as well as of those scattered hordes, dwelling around the oases of the dreary sand wastes to their south. The faith of the Prophets and Seers of a King David or Josiah gives but a poor 1 By the kindness of Mr Marcus Keane. 2 Judg. viii. 33; Bagster’s Comp.

Where a king of Asyria had a finely carved bull, rare amulet, symbolic hats and collars, the masses of his people would only have, as we now see in India, the undisguised emblems of fertility in man and beast. Just as the bull meant virile power, and the Sun and Moon the two energies of fertility, so the Lingam and Yoni would be seen in every village green, and under every holy or umbrageous tree. We would douhtless find rude bulls and buffaloes of all sizes composed of straw and mud, with wonderfully developed organs, just as we do in the wilder parts of India to this hour; see in illustration of this the large rude elephant-like horse called Mamojee, at page 72, Vol. I.—and the same object but quaintly and indelicately formed, under the holy fig-tree, page 31. We know from the tablets of Akadians and Kaldians that they had such “a Savior,” or “Salvation,” in MAMITU “their Jewel,” Sakba or Sakti and Nam-baru, that which “dwelt in the midt of the heavenly abyss,” and fell from heaven like the Palla-dium of Troy, or Ancile of Latins.1 ARKS AND BIRDS.—The “Bird of the Sun”—the cock, receives his full share of attention from the ancient empires, indeed, the Hebrew commentators conjecture that Nergal—the idol of the men of Cuth—had the form of a cock.2 As he reminded Petra “the Stone,” of the words of “the Sun of Righteousness,” so had Kaldia recognised him three thousand years before as the morning announcer of their Lord calling them to the active duties of life. I give here an important group of pictures exhibiting many phases of old Mesopotamian faiths, of which Figures II. and VI. show us sun, moon (or ark) and Lingam worship, where the Sun is represented as the awakening bird. Mr. Layard writes in regard to this Fig. VI.: “Another interesting gem obtained by me at Babylon is an agate cone upon the base of which is engraved a winged priest or deity standing in an attitude of prayer before a cock on an altar; above this group is the crescent moon.3 Fig. II. is a copy of a cylinder in the Brit. Mus., and gives us, says Layard, “a. priest wearing the sacrificial dress standing at a table before an altar bearing a crescent, and a smaller altar on which stands a cock.” Surely the author saw the Phallus on the nearer altar, and if so it is a pity he did not say this twenty years ago, for such modesty has kept us all back and led men. on the wrong track. The Phallus here bears the crescent just as Siva did in that wonderful Som-Nát shrine, and is precisely like the Polynesian phallus given on page 444, Vol. I.4 The priest has the mystic bag in his right and a cross in his, left hand; so in “the gem” Fig. VI. we have the worshipper with the bag, but the cock there stands on the ark itself, thereby making it a very per-fect and complete ohject of worship, and equivalent in all respects to the upper altar with the Phallus and Selene, and exactly such an object as the Jewish Ark, and Eduth 1 Trans.

This is seen on the sacred poles of all Bar- mese Temples or Paiyas3 situated on the standard or firm portion at the base of the quivering or oscillating top of these; it is a Boodhist type of Vishnoo’s goose which was sent to awaken the wearied Brahma when “he rested” as Elohim did after his six days of creative energy. 1 In the article quoted from Trans.

He describes the visit thus: “It was some time before my eyes had been sufficiently accustomed to the dim light to distinguish an object, from which a large red coverlet had been raised on my entry. The Kawal drew near with every sign of respect, bowing and kissing the corner of the cloth on which it was placed. A stand of bright brass or copper, in shape like the candlesticks generally used in Mosool and Bagdad, was surmounted by a rude image of a bird in the same metal, and more like an Indian or Mexican idol, than a cock or peacock. Before it stood a copper bowl to receive contributions . . . . There are four such images, one for each district visited by the Kawals. The Yezidis declare that . . . . no Melek Taus has ever fallen into the hands of the Mussalmans . . . It is not looked upon as an idol but as a symbol or banner,” which is also the case with the Boodhist Hans, and probabIy was so latterly with the Serpent pole of the Jews. Fig. No. IV. here is copied from a cylinder of translucent green felspar called “Amazon Stone,”1 and is thought by Layard to have been the signet or amulet of King Senakerib who seems to be the figure in the arched frame, as this monarch is so depicted on the rock tablets of Bavian, and at the Mahr-El-Kelb in Syria. Mr. Layard says “he holds in one hand the sacrificial mace, and raises the other in the act of adoration,” but I think it is the sacrificial knife, and that the raised hand, with projecting finger, forms a Phallus and Yoni, for the thumb and forefinger are joined. The frame forms that double meaning—the Lingam God, as we see in the case of Siva or Agni, Vol I., page 122. No doubt the phallic hand is also raised in adoration of the giant Tree of Life seen standing before the two figures and covered with acorns, which spring from a stalk, or it may be from the cleft of fire, such as we see fruiting abundantly in the Babylonian jasper Cylinder No. III. Rampagious fertility prances behind the priestly figure upon a double lotus emblem of female power, while over all is the Triune God as a Sun shedding rays and fleurs-de-lis, or lotuses. No. III is a beautiful and very complete ideograph of worship and sacrifice offered to the god and goddess of Fertility; the figures supporting the Sun-god—here partly injured—are half-man. and half-bull having on the right the phallic cross and on the left the Yoni. The sacrifice is the usual goat of the Korsabad sculptures. No. I. is from an Asyrian cylinder,2 and is also very suggestive, for here is a man with a hooked finger soliciting favour, says Layard, “from an Asyrian goddess, perhaps As-tarte or the Moon, surrounded by ten stars and with a dog seated before her.” Her hands are open and an upreared serpent seems to issue from the upper one, and I half think the staff behind her on which she leans is another serpent, or as more common 1 Nin. and Bab., p. 40. 2 Ibid., p. 516-17. American Ed., 1853,"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 89a phallus. The dog before her looks happy and complacent, and is suggestive of Passion, whilst the character of the implorer is clearly depicted by the budding tree, on which prances a goat. The cylinder is an agate of the same period, Mr Layard be-lieves, as the fish-god and signet-gems of Senakerib. Thus the old sculptures and gems of Babylon and Asyria furnish sufficient proof of the worship of Fertility, but writers and readers have alike lost the key, or purposely skipped the subject, and this we have a prominent example of in the case of the beautiful Asyrian cylinder exhibiting the worship of the Fish God, which Mr. Rawlinson gives us without a comment.1 There we see the mitred man-God with rod and basket adoring the solar Fructifier hovering over the fruitful tree from which spring thirteen full buds,2 whilst behind him stands another adoring winged deity backed by a star, a dove, and a yoni. On the opposite side of the Tree of Life is fire, and another man in the act of adoration, probably the Priest of God, pleading with both hands open, that the requests of the other two figures may be granted. Without such explanation no ordinary reader of ancient history can understand it aright, and often not even a hint is thrown out to put them on the right track, so that it is no wonder, as Mr. Rawlinson writes in regard to the mythologies of these ancient peoples, “that scholars have scarcely penetrated below the surface . . . baffled by the obscurity of the subject.”3 It is not indeed the scholarship that is at fault, for any intelligent though illiterate Brahman, tolerably conversant with Sivaik faiths, if judiciously interrogated, will soon explain what writers like Dr. Inman and myself have thus described; he from long and deep research amidst the obscurities of histo-rians, and I from lengthy study of what I saw going on around me. ROYAL COLLAR.—We have a great clue to the “obscurities” in the highly symbolic Royal Band or Collar which I have given as No. VIII. in Fig. 207, p. 77. On this, says our historian, “were hung the monarch’s sacred emblems, the crescent or moon-god, Sin; the four-rayed disc, the emblem of the sun-god, Shamas, and the six- rayed or eight-rayed disc, the emblem of Goola, the sun-goddess.” So far clear and good—but in the other two the author quite misses the mark,”the horned cap being,” he says. “perhaps the emblem of the king’s guardian genius” ! No doubt! but still a lingam or fascinum, the guardian from evil, and representing the great tutelary gods or patriarchs, Asher, Hercules, &c.4 Such emblems appear to have been pretty commonly worn by all ranks, in the Babylonian, Asyrian. and Roman empires, as they are at this moment by most pious worshippers at the shrines of Maha-deva in India. “The fifth emblem is that of Iva—the God of the Atmosphere”—Yes, but as divine fire or Passion, which in its season moves all these gods and animals, and with-out which Maha-deva never acts. This Iva is Vul or Ool, the son of Anoo or Anu, “the Herald of the Gods,” the Ruach or creating spirit of Genesis. He was not Va-lua 1 Anc. Mons., I. 475. 2 The annual periods of the female. 3 Anc.

"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 90or Bar, or Ninip, which were three names given to the Light of the Gods, or that which irradiates all peoples—the Dyaus of the Vedas, the Zeus of the Greeks, and pro-bably the Manes of the Egyptians. The centre emblem of the collar is one which is very often shown as the chief emblem of creation, the acme or “perfection of Life,” the goal of existence or completed union. It is Venus or Sivi in the arms of Sol—the clasped masonic triangles or strange complications we see in Fig. 99, p. 228, Vol. I., perhaps that moon-faced one of ser-pentine rays or hair within the winged Python or Mercury’s Caduceus; so, at least, have the followers of Siva said in answer to my enquiries. In the fourth, or fascinum, we see the origin of the sacred helmet hat which every monarch wore on state occasions, or when going to worship, when he aho held in his hand the royal mace, or phallic-rod, emblem of power and manliness. Ear-rings, armlets, or bracelets partook of the same character, the ornaments being commonly adorned with wreathed serpents. In the Royal Garden scene at Kouyunjik, which Mr. Rawlinson gives us (II. 107), we see the same helmet article1 which so “baffles the scholars of Europe,” but regarding which, when I have sought for explanation from Hindoo gentlemen, they exclaimed without doubt or hesitation: “Verily! Maha-deva,” whilst the objects on the altar-table show the radiant Sun-god and Cup or Luna—Asher’s refulgent home. The Camp Altar heading this chapter, and Figs. 86 and 87, p. 206, and the cone of the lower altar in 104 of p. 232, Vol. I., all illustrate this subject. The high, thick, lighted altar-candles of Europe are but the coarse uniting of the two ideas symbolised in gems four and five on the Asyrian monarch’s collar. In the adjoining eagle-headed figure, No. 220, possibly the Nishrok ]rsn of the Hebrew, and representing Jupiter as the eagle of the Heavens—power and swiftness, which Mr. Layard dug out of the N. W. Palace of Nimrood,2 we see but another form of the royal and priestly worshippers before the Yoni Tree of Life, which is given on page 213 of Vol. I. Some have thought that inasmuch as Siva is “Lord of Wombs,” this bag may represent the womb of creation, and if so the two hands would. typify the right and left hand sects, Lingamites and Saktis, but I doubt this, inasmuch as the testis is always a prominent object amongst phallic worshippers. In the early ages we are speaking of, all peoples worshipped the creative energies according to their varied views of the causes of Fertility. One said, “It is the sun, and once-a-year he fertilises animal and vegetable nature.” “Comfort me with apples, for I am sick of love,” said the Sabean worshipping queen to her Lord; to which he replies: “rise up my love, my fair one, and come away, for lo, the winter is past, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come.”3 If sun or fire was, supposed to fertilise the creative organs of vegetable and animal life, then the sun and fire, and not the organs themselves, were worshipped. If lunar influence seemed to some 1 Anc. Mons. II. 107. See the kings’ helmets of pages 64 and 80, and the Gods, p. 83, ante. 2 Nin. and Bab., I. 64. See 2 Kings xix. 37.

NISROK? more especially to act on the fertility of their females, then the moon was revered and called “kind Luna,” or even a male god, but if the rude mind was unable to soar so high, and could see nothing but the organs themselves as the cause of all their joys, and the source of all their wealth in population, flocks and herds; then naturally their vows1 and prayers were offered to the organs of the genus they longed for, while sacrifices were freely made to all the deities of the air, and hills, and plains, to mollify their wrath and keep them innocuous. The very fascinum we find is termed “a be-witcher,” and our ordinary Latin school dictionaries tell us its meaning in language which I need not here repeat.2 Romans hung the symbol round the necks of children, “as a charm to drive away mischief,” as the ancient monarchs of Mesopotamia had done two thousand years before. UNIVERSALITY OF THE FAITH.—The intercourse of nations with each other, except where seas intervened, was very much as it still is in the case of uncivilised peoples; all knew each other’s gods, and as none seemed astonished at what they saw, we may conclude that this faith was the prevalent one over the whole earth, varied only a little more or less with fetish or Totem-worship. The passes from Nineveh to the Black or Caspian Sea; from the Ekbatanas to the Oxus, and the Indus, are still very much what they were then; and then as now daring traders in strong bands, unclothed religious preachers and mendicants, freely passed from land to land; the former being especially welcome at the courts of kings and queens on account of the “ivory, and peacocks,” the pearls, corals, spices, and charms which they brought. The voluptuous Semiramis, of Phallic proclivities, but whom history does not yet vouch for, probably reached India as well as the man-god Dian-Nisi or Dionysus, or rather a ruler of that name devoted to Lingam faith and the company of fair ladies. Indian elephants, and other products of the far East, we find depicted abun-dantly on Kaldian monuments.3 Nor were ancient Greek and Latin writers, “baffled,” 1 See the oaths of the Jewish Patriarchs, then believed to be contemporary history and note, p. 89.

Ptolemy and the historians of Alexander reveal the faiths through their maps, for they put down “Larice,” or “Lares,” or “Larissa,” as the names of towns from the Indus to the Nile, wherever they found Sivaism rampant; and they show us a “SHEEVA” or “Sivu” as the Amon Fount in the Lybian desert, as well as a “Larice” on the coasts of Kātyār (Kāl-Eswār?). Thus by these names they describe to their people, succinctly and clearly, the faiths and proclivities of the nations and cities which they had seen. As “Asher is known by his emblems,” so is Katiwar by its penchant for “elongated stones” and so were Roman citizens by their love for their household Lares and Penates. To be an enemy of Asher was to be an enemy of the populator and populations of Asyria. Asher was the Abram or “the strong one” of Syria—“the progenitor,” “he who lived in the circle of life” or creation. Nay, he has been called “The Dove” with outspread wings, as well as Venus;1 “the holder of the bow;” “the discharger of the arrow;” “the destroyer, and he who maketh alive again;” “the Triple god,” or “Trinity-in-unity.”2 “The triple figure shows him to be in temporary combination,” says Rawlinson, “with two other gods,” which is perfectly true, though the author does not, I fancy, attach to his words the full force they merit. With Asher is ever associ-ated “the tree of life,” or “life-giving tree,” which we occasionally see divested of all or-nament, and therefore clearer in its signification. It is then a plain column—the Column universales—with rounded top, and flaming hood or Baldachin of expanded serpents over it; and hence those who desire to stand as a god-king, “man of God,” or high priest, in the eyes of the world, are shown in the position of the column, and sit under a Baldachin. In Vol. I., Fig. 25, p. 73, I give an imperfect idea of the budding column.3 Where shown plain by Asyrians, there is usually seen (as in Fig. 219, 3, 4) irradiating from its sides long, slender stalks carrying the very Phallic forms of acorns in cups as a species of bud; so holy men or women and holy objects are often exhibited as ir-radiating light and flowers, and if the holy ones be imaged with a bird’s head, we find a radiant comb as in the gods or demi-gods usually worshipping the feminine tree of life. This last, however, is a highly ornate and more complicated symhol than “the Pillar God;” and here, too, we see the Baldachin of serpents crowning “the holy door of life,” which Dr. Inman explains from a professional point of view.4 It is a long caveum not always shown open, as here, but as in Fig. 25, above noted, which sug-gests the idea of the Zoroastrian Atāsh bairām, the cleft or niche of fire. 1 Anc.

Asher, though the Phallic god, was often considered the Lingam in the abstract, as well as the Omphe. Thus “the ‘mound of Anu,’ in the city of Asher, was called Tel-aney, a local name for the Creator,”3 (probably Ta-El-Ane,) which I think, however, is only so far correct, that the Jahveh—Eduth or Tes-timony of the Ark or Omphe, is identical with it. All the gods—Bel, Iva, &c.—could wear Asher’s helmet-hat; and Bel, Il, and Ra, all had their temples in ancient Asher; and it is believed that the three Lingams (our author says “helmets”) on the rocks of Bavian represented the Asyrian Triad, Anoo, Bel and Hoa.4 So Bel reads Dagon, and either or both are Bel-Dagon, which, however, is properly Bel and his fecundatrix the fertile fish-god, the god of the waters. It will be profitable to look a little closely at the word Asher or Asar, and a very competent Hebraist sends me the following notes on it and its etymons:— r`a = ashar, “to be united by love, marriage, &c.” larCa = asarel, a man’s name; El is united. 1 Chron. iv. 16. rCa = asar is equivalent to the Phœnician rsa, Osiris, an epithet of Baal, husband of hr`a = ashe-rah. The lca, Ashel of Abram was probably Asher. r`a = asher, happy; the name of a son of Jacob (Gen. xxx. 13), and capital of the territory of Manasseh (Josh. xvii. 7). The ` = sh and t = th, are interchangeable. rw`a = ashur, is the name of the ancestor of the Asyrians. rw`a = ashur, is also a level, a plain, and is the name of the land of Asyria on the east side of the Tigris (Gen. ii. 14). rta = athar, is a step, a walk, a track, in Kaldi. rta = athar, is a Hebrew verb, to spread out, to stretch wide. `ya = Ish, is a man—ca = esh, is fire. }wca = Eshun, is “blackness.” The a aleph and the o ayin are interchangeable. trt`o = astereth, a married female companion; hence Astarte or Venus. Asur (Asher) looked at from a Turanian point of view, says the Rev. A. H. Sayce, comes from A “water” and Sur “bank or field,” which yields, therefore, a dual or bi-sexual god A, and Isis, “the field,” “delta” or “yielding Terra,” through the agency of A, “fertilizing water.” A-Sur would therefore be a dual god, the Zakar and Nekaba or male and female of Gen. i. 23.

In India he is very commonly still “streaked,” and symbolises Hea, God of Seas and Serpents; see Fig. 4, p. 39. The word Asher would be at once pronounced by every ordinary Eastern linguist to be derived from Ish, “man” or Esh, “love,” and Ar, the god or active power; and as connected with Aish-oo-Isherat, “sexual pleasure;” we would expect to hear that the great city called after the Mahadeva was at the junction of two rivers, the Great Zab and Tigris, which it is. Xenophon called this city Larissa, for it was the Rasena of still more ancient times. Asher, or as also anciently pronounced, Athor or Ather, (the exact Egyptian name for the Goddess of Love and Beauty), was the name given to the whole country of the lower Tigris. This is now very commonly called Louri-stan, which I would rather not translate otherwise than by saying that it signifies a place devoted to the worshippers of the phallic emblems. The old eastern word Louri is still very common over all India and its coasts, and is used indiscriminately as a term of abuse, to both male and female, though words of such etymology as Kun, &c., are commonly applied to the female. WATER.—A few words in regard to the worship of Water. Hoa or Hea, the Hu of our Keltic ancestors, whose symbol was the shield and serpent, was specially worshipped near rivers or lakes, and if possible on the sea-shore, where were offered to her such em-blems as a golden vessel, boat, coffer, or fish, and she was then named Belat Ili, “the mistress of the gods.” All water was holy to her, for she was here Salacia, Canopus, Varoona, Maya, Venus, Ourania, &c., nor are such goddesses yet neglected; I have myself been often blessed for dropping a rupee into a lake or river, or an angry im-petuous stream, as I was crossing it, and we see from many accounts of Himalayan travellers that this is still a common practice. Water, perhaps more than Fire, has always been used as a purifier; rivers and seas being preferred to lakes and stagnant pools, and perhaps salt water (as thought to be more connected with generative matters) to fresh. Christians have but imitated the ancients, in the use of Lustral water— now-a-days called Holy water, and into which salt should be freely put; all ancient priests and people used to dip their fingers in the Lustral water when they entered a temple to sacrifice, and shrines sacred to water are found in every land, generally standing on a river bank or the sea coast, or, failing these, on a lake, otherwise beside a well or artificial basin. Sea temples are usually of as large and costly dimensions as can be constructed. The Cibola tribes of New Mexico, says Francis Vasques, “pay no adoration to anything but water,” as being, they say, the one chief support of all life. At certain seasons, the Greek Christian Church and the Hindoo faith prescribe adorations, sacrifices, and other water rites, and hence we find all orthodox clergy and devotees have much to do with rivers, seas and wells, especially at certain annual Solar periods. "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 95Towards the close of the northern winter, all ranks of Russians from the Czar to the lowliest cottar, crowd with their clergy of all denominations to the Neva, and with solemn pomp and prayer break its ice, bless the waters—then held to be of virgin purity, and sprinkle them on Czar, nobles, and peoples. The public press lately recounted these proceedings thus. An Imperial and Arch-episcopal procession was formed, con-sisting of, first, the high priest of the empire in all his most gorgeous robes, the two masters of ceremonies walking backwards (probably because not of a holy enough order), long double files of white and gold-robed bearers of sacred flambeaux or candles, for Fire must enter into every ceremony, whether it is the male or female energy which is being worshipped. Following these Religieux came all the sacred relics and fetishes of the Church, as Maya’s holy cup for water, all holy books, crosses, banners, with sacred emblems in their order, and finally the Czar, humbly, and, like all his people, on foot, followed by courtly throngs. These all proceeded to a handsome pavilion or kiosk, erected close to the edge of the water, when the Metropolitan of the Church reverently made an incision in the ice, and took out a little water in a sacred golden cup bearing strange devices. The firing of guns accompanied these solemn acts in all their stages, and wherever the grave procession moved, it always did so with mea-sured tread, chanting sacred verses to the old, old deity of our race, and surrounded with all the pomp of war; whilst at intervals, peals of Christian bells and the booming of near and distant guns added to the solemnity of this water pageant. After the filling of the golden cup, which of course represents the earth and its fulness and, at this season, the now expected increase, the High Priest placed a golden crucifix on the virgin water and blessed its return from wintry death, invoking the precious fluid to vernal life and productiveness, when lo! a holy child suddenly appears upon the scene, reminding us that this is everywhere the outcome of “the waters of life” in all animal as well as vegetal production—Boodha in the garden of Loobini through which flowed a holy stream, and Christ by the brook at Bethlehem, nay, the first pair in the garden of the four rivers, are all the same idea—fertility and creation. The High Russian Pontiff now slowly and solemnly stooped, and taking up some of the holy water, proceeded to sprinkle the vernal child—Jesus, whispered these crowds, but the ancients said Horus. The sacred fluid was then sprinkled on the clergy, Czar, and all dignitaries, and finally on the sacred emblems, banners, guns, &c., &c. Men and women, ay, wise as woll as foolish, of every rank, now crowded forward, and on bended knee besought their Patriarch to sprinkle and to bless them. Finally, the great Czar put the cup to his lip, humbly and reverently, and then filled it to over-flowing with a wealth of golden pieces, for it is the still living representative in the nine-teenth century A.C. of “the golden boat” of Hea of the nineteenth century B.C. In Scotland there used to be ceremonies similar to these. At certain fords, on a par-ticular day, the priests assembled and sprinkled the people to keep away from them malignant influences throughout the year; and the same rite was observed at a "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 96grand annual festival in Ceylon. At midsummer tide, at the Ganorooa ferry, Kandia, the chief priests of the four principal temples sit in canoes or State barges, like those of our Elizabethan days, from midnight to the first streak of dawn, when all are roused to life, and the high priest takes a solar or golden sword and solemnly de-cribes a circle on the water, after which all the clergy fill their pitchers, and then go in procession to the temples with the mystic fluid, where it remains till July follow-ing. So once every year, if not oftener, we see crowds of pious Hindoos, where they reside near the ocean, making solemn festival on its shores. They advance towards the waters with reverent step and solemn chant and prayer, burning incense and offer-ing of their abundance; but as a rule, more of Phallic or creative energy is here sought for from Salacia, and there is less of Solar mythology than in that on Neva’s banks. To return to Asyrian faiths. FAITH OF SENAKERIB.—Senakerib worshipped water, as his Tsabean name and lineage would lead us to believe, and much as I have shown in the case of Hindoos and Christians, and his doing so on the sea coast, which cost him a laborious march of many hundred miles, is thus duly recorded, says Mr. Smith, on the Imperial tablets:—“At the place where the Euphrates mingles with the ocean (always a holy spot) Senakerib performed sacrifices to Hea, the gods of the sea, and with grand cere-monies rode out into the ocean, and dropped into the water images of ships and fishes (women) made of gold as offerings to the deity.”1 It is no wonder that this king went here to sacrifice, for he knew of the tradition which Jews appropriated to themselves and their Moseh (one “saved by water”),2 that his great predecessor, if not ancestor, Sargon, king of Akad, had been preserved by the waters of this holy stream, when hid away by his mother for safety on them, three thousand years before Sena-kerib’s day, in “a little cradle of bull-rushes coated with bitumen.” The god whose name he bore—great Ak or Aki, the Sun, then befriended his namesake, for Sar and Ak signify the same, though possibly none but the inventors of the tale ever knew it; still we cannot doubt that the whole of such stories are allegories of Solar phenomena. The Jews say their Moses floated in a bulrush cradle on the Nile between the thir-teenth and sixteenth centuries B.C., and 3800 B.C.3 is the time Asyriologists allot for the birth of the early Sargon of Akad. Sin-ak-erib himself is named after the moon, Sin, which, as already stated, may have been a male deity, for in his day it was commonly symbolised, say many writers, as the man we constantly see at prayer or sacrifice with outstretched open hand, though I rather suspect, as the open hand is always Siva that this man is more likely to be engaged in prayer to Siva with the male god’s emblem as an offering, this being the usual mode of approach, see Plate XIII. 2, and the Egyptian figure Vol I. p. 184. The Asyrians had gods or genii of rivers, marshes, forests, &c., like all other peoples, and offered sacrifices to all their gods as the Jews did to their Elohim and Yahveh; indeed, from these great nations, the outlying tribes must have gathered all their rites and religion. 1 Assyria, written for Christ.

Mary, however, we must remember, is not always the Mary common to all—“the virgin of heaven,” “the mother of God”— but she is also special, as “Mary our mother,” of this place, or of that town, nay, and of that chapel, just as Rawlinson tells us “Ishtar of Nineveh was distinguishcd from the Ishtar of Arbela, and both from the Ishtar of Babylon or Akad, separate addresses being made to them in one and the same invocation;”1 yet is “Our lady-mother,” like her son, “not three deities, but one;” and so it is with the male gods, and, indeed, all other female deities. Asher, as well as Nebo, of the conical moun-tain, had an Ishtar to wife, and so every Hindoo god has a Sakti; and yet we find Nebo and Ishtar spoken of as the same! and most Christians, that is Roman Catholics say, that praying to Mary is praying to Christ—nay, to God. So Jupiter and his Olympus were often identical, which is but Nebo the cone becoming Nabe the navel, navis, boat, or that Yoni model, the Os tincæ2 which Dr. Inman often alludes to. It is languages or dialects more than anything else that have multiplied the gods, for when we go to the root-idea they are much the same. Ishtar is really Sakti, (Sakba?), “the door of life,” and that shapeless Omphe we see at Eastern city gates; she is the Arabian Alita, the Persian Mitra,3 the Greek Mylita, the Trojan Moorina, and the Babyloniun Alata, whom Rawlinson thinks is merely the feminine Al, that is Alta. Mul, we are told, is the same as Bel or Nin, the Lord, and Mula but a variant of Gula,4 and the origin of our very feminine term Molly from mullÒj, the pudendum; hence mull£j, a prostitute, and the “Mollies,” who, we learn, are the Jewish Kadeshim,5 \\ycdq so that tracing such matter to their source always lands us in the same unpleasant pools of unclean animalism. Moladah, hdlwm, signifies “birth,” but Malatzah; “she is lovely, pleasant,” and as all oracles are connected with the mouth and eloquence, “she who is eloquent;” this is equivalent to the Keltic Ashtoreth. Ish-tar was but a form of Beltis and Gool as well as of Mamit, that “Treasure of the gods, and of heaven and earth, which passes not away.”6 Elsewhere we find her called UM-MIR, which also signifies “Mother Water,” and is associated with the idea of a bird, reminding us of “Venus’ bird of Love,” and sundry matter already spoken of.7 In Sanskrit and current Eastern tongues, Um-mie and Ama mean “the great mother,” and the root of all such words is Ma or Mē, Mwē, or Mwyē, which last signifies in Siamese and Barmese, Fire-water, for Mwe is there also the colloquial for Fire. In Asyrian, Ha is ordinary water; Hi, yj, is in Hebrew, Life, and in Asyrian, “the female power of the Sun,” whilst in Egyptian, Ma-On means the “pudendum of ON.” The primitive mother in Bengal is often called Basoola or 1 Anc.

Every name, whether of man, woman, or town, was compounded in ancient days with the names ot the gods—that is of the symbols of Fertility; latterly of sun, moon, and planets, but at first, merely of the creative emblems, as Pal and Fal or Fan and Ash and Isha. These histories abound with Ashers, Pals (Palus or Phallus), Bars, Bans, Fans, Asher, Assir, Asar, Assur, Azir, Esh, Ish, Az-Tar, Esh-tar, Estar, or Esara, &c., running into the Sanskrit Eswar and Northern Esir. Thus we have Assur-zakir-Eser, or Ninip-tugal-Assuri, the Asyrian king of 1600 B.C., Nabu-dan of 1500 B.C., Ninip-pal-Esar of 1200 B.C., Assur-dain-pal of 800 B.C., and Assur-bani-pal, the last great emperor of his race, of 650 B.C.1 For Bal, Pal, and Pala, see vol. I., pp. 296-319. The feminine in Hebrew is formed by adding h, so that Bol, “Lord,” lob becomes hlob, “Lady.” Bani, Ben, or Bar signify a son, or the male who “erects” and “builds;” also “corn” as the animal builder. Of Nin, Ninip, and Nebo, enough has already been said. It was natural that ignorant. masses should confuse the gods and goddesses when told by their priests to look upon the somewhat complicated figure of a highly ornate wheel, probably with radiating phalli, and within the crescented Luna, and commanded to call the whole, “God,” Asher or Esar, Hur or Sin, Shamas or Baal. Hindoos, Jews, and Christiana have at times confused the sex of their gods; thus in Gen. i. 26, Elohim is both “male and female like unto us,” but the Holy Ghost was a female, and Arda-Nari-Iswara, Pl. XIV. 1—partook of both genders. All the emblems and ideas were universal, but at first most gross, especially amongst hill tribes, as the dwellers on the Zagros, Median, Lebanon, and of course, Judean hills, although pious Christian writers who cling to Jewish faiths, would have us believe that these peculiarly sensual tribes were better in this respect than the great nations who so continually instructed and held them in bondage.2 ASYRIAN PIETY.—The Rev. Mr Rawlinson bears emphatic testimony to the highly religious character of Asyrians. Their faith was deep-seated, sincere, and thoroughly earnest, and evidently entered into every duty of their lives, public or private, far more than ours. He truly says: “They uttered sincere prayers, and we are bound to credit them with an honest purpose,” but this is saying too little, for nothing but foolish prejudice or arrogance on our part could lead us to withhold this poor modicum of credit from any brother man, and these people were no ordinary worshippers. Many, indeed, are the thoroughly sincere and pious fellow-labourers with whom we daily read and work in the East, and whose faith we must classify with that of Asyria, who put to shame, in their earnest prayerful lives, not a few of the constant frequenters of our own phallic-crowned, Solo-Christian temples. Without going back to the martyrs of long past days—and none have shown such carelesanesa of life in the matter of faith 1 I here adopt the usual spelling of Asyriologists, although I think it is needlessly profuse in consonants and arbitrary in vowels.   2 See Anc.

Who of them would keep his hand clenched until the nails grew through the flesh; or hold a limb in one cranked position until every muscle grew rigid; or starve his body to emaciation, and otherwise punish and torture himself, making life one long term of trial, and but a waiting for the end? Yet all this thousands of our fellow subjects are continually doing to please the great Creative God, whom sheer custom has taught them to look at in the light of only one of his attri-butes. It is the height of ignorance and prejudice, due to false teachings and isolation, to imagine that our own lives and prayers are purer or more valued in the sight of God than those of other men. Our culture has risen above that of Easterns, because we have to some extent avoided one of their grievous faults, viz., a proud isolation which they courted, and which ended in the execrable system of caste, which more or less, however, exists in every land, like ignorance, prejudice, and pride, and clings alike to the followers of Christ, Vishnoo, and Siva. It is more than probable that in the eyes of “The All-Seeing One,” the purlieus of unenlightened Benares are neither dark nor impure, compared with the misery, sensuality, and vice of every hue and kind which degrades our brightly illumined Christian capitals, and this, I fear we must acknowledge, whether we extend our researches into the homes and habits of our poorer brothers and sisters, or seek the pleasing haunts of indolence and wealth. But to resume. The following exhibits approximately the ages of the old monarchies of the Nile and Western Asia, which readers may glean more accurately from the Synchronological tables and my large Chart. There are errors, I think, in regard to Egypt, Kaldia, and Asyria, owing to Jewish and Christian writers being trammeled by inspiration theory, patriarchs, and the mythical deluge, which was clearly only a local upheaval in con-nection with the great lacustrine plateaus of Western Asia.

Asyria asks for as high an antiquity as Kaldia; but as “Rome only lasted as a kingdom, commonwealth, and empire twelve centuries,” Mr. Rawlinson thinks that Asyria. could not have been a kingdom in Kaldia's early days. In this, however, he is clearly swayed by the unknown writers of Genesis, stories of the Jewish patriarchs, the Mosaic flood, Jonah, etc., which tales a large and increasing body of learned men are rejecting as unworthy of credence, asserting that the earth was populated and that great kingdoms existed long before the days treated of even in the tablets of Akadia. Such persons are now giving credit to many old writers which Christian orthodoxy1 cannot of course grant, unless it puts aside the Bible as a mere collection of stories more or less correct which ever and again reached the Jewish tribes. It is not to be doubted that cities of great im-portance did exist on the remarkable sites which the Asyria of history claims, and especially at and around ancient Asher and in Kaldia, possibly even before the times of the Erek, Akad, or Hur now so well known to us. Ctesias tells us that a great Nineveh was destroyed in 875 B.C., but inasmuch as this is long before the time of Jonah, this statement is pooh-poohed,2 and the story of the whale adhered to instead, as much more credible. Ctesias was here clearly wrong, and may not be otherwise trustworthy; but Jonah’s travels are no reason for rejecting any writer’s statements. Ctesias3 lived 400 years B.C., and some hundred and twenty years before Berosus, and we shall probably find that, as in the case of Manetho of Egypt, if we search more inde-pendently, he too will enable us to antedate and improve our chronologies, even as orthodox Egyptologists have gradually of late had to acknowledge the trustworthiness of much abused Manetho, and not of Hebrew records. Berosus was a Kaldian pricst of Belus who wrote, he says, from the archives of the temple of Belus, between 261 and 246 B.C., but unfortunately we have only frag-ments of his writings presented by Josephus, Eusebius, and Syncellus, and here and there in the Christian fathers—all highly untrustworthy transcribers, especially Euse-bius and Josephus, where their own faiths are concerned. Berosus is made to say that “a great tower was erected at Babel by giants in order to make war with the gods,” which the weather beat down, and naturalIy so, as it was constructed with only sun-dried bricks. It is not to be believed that any priest of Belus would say that one of the most sacred and noble structures of his country, and a phallic emblem such as a tower, was constructed in order to anger or make war upon the gods. This is clearly an ignorant Syrian idea, which none of the astronomers of Kaldia could imagine. It is only reasonable that Ctesias should not agree with Berosus; the former wrote from the Asyrian and Persian point of view, and the latter, says Professor Schmitz, “from 1 See rejections in and about II. 250 of Anc. Mons. 2 See Anc. Mons., 285, Note II. 3 He was a physician of Karia in Asia Minor, and accompanied Artaxerxes Mnemon in his war against his brother Cyrus. He wrote works on Persia andIndia.

It is, however, doubtful if the extant fragments of Berosus were the writings of the original priest, or of a Greek who took the celebrated Babylonian name of Bar Oseas, or “Son of Os,” for the fragments we have are all in good Greek. RISE OF SHEMITES.—There are good grounds for believing that Mesopotamia threw out emigrants westwards into Syria and north-west into the Aram,—the earliest name for all the northern and mountainous parts of Syria (signifying literally “the highlands” of a country),2 about 1900 B.C.; or more likely 1600 B.C., for the Rev. A. H. Sayce tells us that Shemitic was unknown till 1600 B.C. in the valleys of the Euphrates.3 From this race the Jews desired all nations should believe they were descended in the person of a Kaldian Shek called Abram or Brahma, the “High Father,”—a name of Siva, as the dweller on Kailāsa, as this AB or Father was on the Aram of Syria. Probably the wars of one called Kedor-leomer (“the sheaf of corn”), a king of Oelam (\\lyo), led to this emigration or disturbance of the sun and lingam-wor-shipping races of Syria and Arabia Petra, as the Amalekites, Amonites, etc. HEBREW STYLE.—Asyrian history constantly reminds us that the Jews, whether Arabs of Edumea, as I hold them to be, or of the Babylonian Shemitic races, borrowed the best portions of their faith, language, and style from Asyria, as Mr. Talbot makes very clear. Tiglath Pileser of the eighth century prayed and taught much as Isaiah, Ezekiel, and many a writer of the Pentateuch did ages after him, as the following freely translated inscription of the pious monarch will show, and he wrote in the usual style of those days4:—“In the beginning of my reign the great Gods Anoo and Ina com-manded me to repair this their temple, and from its foundation to its roof I have rebuilt it. I have reared up unto heaven two lofty towers or pillars (such as Solomon is said by Jews to have done also); a noble hall have I consecrated for the use of the great Gods and their votaries, numerous as the stars of heaven; a secret adytum, or Holy of Holies, have I also built for the special service of God; and oh, may He preserve me and bless me, my government, and my people, and send rain and fruitful seasons, making even the desert to rejoice. I will let the Lord guide all my steps, and may He grant unto me His servant, and to my children after me, peace and empire. To Him, the one great God Asher, do I offer prayer and sacrifice, and abundance of victims for His altars. Whosoever shall injure the house of God, the sacred tablets, or hide them from God’s people, his name shall be consigned to perdition, and he himself be cursed everlastingly. May his sovereignty perish, and his offipring not survive him; may his troops fly before their enemies, and famine and misery desolate all his lands; may no day of his life be joyous to him, and may his race be finally and for ever extinguished.” Very Jewish, orthodox, and pious ecclesiastical language, from which, however, every religious man must turn with loathing and disgust. 1 Smith’s Dic.

He justly points out the close connection between the religious feeling of Jews and Asyrians which it manifests. I cannot, however, agree with him that there is any worthy parallel between the little temple and houses of the Hebrew Solomon, or even the kingdom of so called mighty David, and the empires, “temples, palaces, and piles stupendous” of Babylon, Asyria, and Egypt; but in truth history proper knows not of any of David or Solomon, so no parallel need be drawn.1 NEW BIBLICAL INACCURACIES.—The difficulties which orthodox writers have to meet in contending that the Bible is an infallible historical document are indeed enor-mous, and are increasing with every day’s advancing knowledge, scientific and archeo-logical; and the feverish anxiety with which writings on ancient histories and religions are now received by the churches, and those who, understanding the scope of literary criticism, still cling to them, is painfully apparent. Writers see the weak points in the orthodox defences which the masses do not, and wisely avoiding the onslaught, they watch only for holes in the armour, a process which but perfects every fresh attack of their oppon-ents. If, for instance, Shalmaneser I. only founded Kala or Nimrood about the year 1300 B.C., then the historian sees that this overthrows a great deal of pentateuchal story in Genesis as to Moses having heard of this great city. This the author of Ancient Mons. aknowledges, and in consequence ever shifts his ground, saying that the date of Moses is very uncertain, and this part of Genesis “very possibly an addition of Ezra’s.”2 So that not only is poor Ezra placed in a very invidious position, but the idea of penta-teuchal inspiration is upset, for which nevertheless the chronologies of Kaldia and Asyria have been anxiously curtailed or modified, so as not to interfere with the pseudo-flood of Genesis. AUTHOR OF O.T.—Now, as Ezra—the real writer of the Old Testament as we now have it—was given to making “additions,” why should we hesitate to say that he in-serted the Zend and other Aryan tales of a “Flood,” made the Eastern Patriarch Brahm into an Abram for his own people, and said that he too walked, talked, and ate with “the gods” or “EIohim” as he would naturally translate the Eastern terms Dyaus, Deva, &c.? So the first Sargon—“Prince of the Sun,” of ancient Akad, would become Is-ra-El, a Hebrew “Prince of El” or the Sun, and the leader of the race out of obscurity to power, and would naturally (as Sargon was found on, the waters in a cradle of bul-rushes) be so pictured as entering the land of Egypt—saved by a Princess of the Sun—Phar-aoh, because Sargon was so saved by Akad, the Sun! What is more probable than such “additions,” when we know that the continual captivities of the tribes, but especially this last long and severe one, from which Cyrus permitted Ezra and some of his people to emerge, had again and again destroyed the unity of the people, and left, so far as we know, not a fragment of any religious records they may have had in Josiah’s days, or say 700 B.C.? It was three hundred and fifty years from Hezekiah 1 Only the writings of a Jew. 2 Mons. II. 303. Of course Ezra wrote the greater portion of the O.T.

The Jews themselves always accept Ezra as the writer of the Pen-tateuch,2 and attribute to him the same degree of inspiration which Christians—anxious to go still further back, ascribe to Moses; but the latter say that Ezra compiled, not composed, the record, although we have not a shadow of proof that there was anything to compile from, and Ezra or Esdras distinctly states that all “the law is burnt, and no man knoweth the things that are done of thee,” Jahveh, but that he “opened his mouth, and gave him to drink” of inspiration a cupful of water like unto fire, which, when he had drunk, his “heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in his heart,” and his spirit strengthened his memory. Then he took with him, by his God’s com-mand, five men and went into a field, and there they wrote in forty days two hundred and four books, of which he was told to give abroad to all the tribes one hundred and thirty-four, and keep secret the last seventy, as only suitable for the very wise,3 scarcely so sage an order as Asher gave to T. Pileser. Thus this revered prophet dedared “no copy remained” of all the holy records of his people and that he who had been born and bred in Kaldia, was commissioned to write according to what he held was inspiration, facts universally accepted by a people who for the last two thousand years have been extraordinarily jealous and conservative in everything relating to their supposed sacred records. Dean Prideaux says that “more ancient evidence than this (of Esdras) we eannot have from any writer,”4 and though the English Church now calls 2 Esdras or Ezra apocryphal, yet all the Roman and Greek churches accept it. Prideaux, like Canon Rawlinson, says that “Ezra inserted in several places such interpolations as he thought necessary,”5 and this agrees with the statement which the Dean quotes from Jewish Rabbim, who say “Ezra was another Moses who revived and restored the law after it had been in a manner extinguished . . . Ezra was a second founder . . . even if the law had not been given by Moses, Ezra was worthy by whom it should be given.6 In these views also con-curred Ireneus, Tertullian, Clemens Alex. Basil, Jerome, Augustine, Chrysostom, &c.7 The 12th chapter of Nehemiah has been a “thorn in the flesh” of Revelationists, for it neglectfully carries down chronology to Jaddua, who lived in the time of Alex-ander the Great, 330 B.C. The words of Prideaux, as the best champion the Church has had, are here weighty, and show us that not only did Ezra “interpolate” and “perfect” the Old Testament books, but that the Jewish Sanhedrim and a whole host of other men did so, from Ezra in 458 to “Simon the Just” in 283, or for one hundred 1 See especially all the last chapter of 2 Chron. 2 Especially Eben-Ezra, Spinoza, Maimonides, Father Simon, &c.

Thus we do not know what was added or rejected during nearly two hundred years, by hundreds of writers, copyists, &c., whom we are not, as in the case of Ezra or Esdras, even asked to consider inspired; and no evidence, not to say proof, has ever been advanced that Esdras had any records to start with. Such, if ever existing, should by this time have been forthcoming, for we have discovered a good deal of other Old Testament matter, in the ancient tales and tablets of the old monarchies under which the tribes were so long, either in captivity or vassalage. There is then undoubtedly good reason for saying that Ezra appears. to have “added” to “the inspired Word,” and far more than most of my readers are aware, for churches have naturally been shy in alluding to these weighty matters, inasmuch as he who adds, also usually, and with equally good reason, subtracts, divides, and multiplies at will, and so people justly ex-claim: “Is this then what the Church calls the inspired Word of God?” Verily it is! Other difficulties like those already pointed out everywhere occur to the orthodox historian of Kaldin and Asyria. For instance, the Asyrian King Ashar-ris-ilm is believed by Mr Rawlinson to be Chushaw-ris-Athaim of Judges iii. 8, who held the Israelites captive for eight years. Now, the tablets give us 1150-1120, or say the first half of the twelfth century B.C. as the date of this ruler, and relate that he was a great conqueror in Aram, or the highlands of Phenicia; whereas the Old Testament makes him live aoout 1400 B.C., a little matter of nearly 2¾ centuries! which, however, is said “not to be insuperable,” as “chronologists regard the period from the Exodus to Solomon as most uncertain.”! Bunsen puts the Exodus B.C. 1320: Lepsius 1314, and Miss Corbaux 1291,2 but there is no contemporary or historical evidence of such an event. Other difficulties, such as the identification of the Hebrew Pul, are got over by saying that the two names of Ivalush and Pul “are not so very different,” the Ivalush IV. of Rawlinson being the Vul-Nirari III. of Smith, 812-783.3 8th C.B.C.—The palmiest days of Asyria were early in the eighth century B.C., in the reign of this Ivaloosh IV., when the northern Shemitic empire had firmly and some-what furiously grasped Babylon, Aram, all the coasts of Phenicia, and great part of Edu-mean Arabia; it then ruled severely from the shores of the Persian Gulf to Gaza, or even Pelusium.4 Ivaloosh IV. is the king whose wife, “Samuramit,” Rawlinson takes to be that ancient Semirmais, around whom so many myths have clung; she was allowed it is said, to share the government with her lord, who married her when a great Kaldian princess, in order to confirm his dynasty over Babylon. This accords with the state-ment of Herodotus as to her origin, and nearly with his chronology, but not with the 1 Geol. of Penta., pp. 17, 27. 2 Anc. Mons., II. 309.

JONAH.—Historians, writing with a foregone conclusion as to Old Testament inspi-ration, are also much perplexed as to Jonah and the whale which swallowed and retained him, whole and undigested, for three days and three nights in its belly, because he was trying “to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Jahveh;”1 also as to Nineveh being only “three days’ journey” from the coast where the whale “vomited him out,” and the size of that capital, which was so “exceeding great a city”—that it was even “a day’s journey” after he “began to enter into it.”2 From the coast to Nineveh is some four hundred miles of mountain and plain, and probably eight by three miles, and not twenty by twelve was about the size of the city. Nothing can be gathered from the now abundant Asyrian records, as to either Jonah or his preaching, so we are told a ro-mantic and sensational tale3 of a voice that made itself heard everywhere throughout the great capital, “a shrill monotonous cry, ‘yet forty days and Nineveh shall be over-thrown’ . . . uttered by a strange wild man clothed in a rough garment of skin,” which the scornful unbeliever might say he must have got from the whale. All may fairly demand to know how it was that one inspired by Jehovah came to make such a mistake as to the period of the duration of the great Empire at this its most glorious and vigorous middle age. No decay or destruction was visible for a century after the date (860 B.C.) of this biblical Jonah, whom the Churches nevertheless tell us was here executing the high and special behests of the Almighty, so Canon Rawlinson considers this date must be set forward one hnndred and ten years or to 750 B.C.; of course we can see no reason why not to any other date, for the Empire showed no signs of falling till 620, and Nineveh did not fall till 607, or two hundred and fifty years after Jonah. Jewish writers have always told us to consider the forty days within which Nineveh was to fall as extended by the clemency of Jahveh to one hundred and forty years, because “the people repented, and therefore so did the Almighty of his purpose;” but this one hundred and forty was then though to square matters, and probably now that the exact history of Nineveh is known, they will ask us to extend Jahveh’s clemency to the year 607. Mr Rawlinson, in a dilemma even with his one hundred. and ten years, throws out a terrible suggestion (p. 307), as to “whether the Hebrew numbers can be con-sidered historical?” Thus do men engaged in historical, or indeed, in any researches whatever, surround themselves by entanglements of all kinds when they start with theories of infallible men or infallible books. The same fate befalls Mr. George Smith, another most valuable writer and in-vestigator, to whom we all owe a great debt of gratitude, but who also starts on a “sound orthodox” basis,—the inspiration of the old Jewish scriptures which such writers crystallize into an infallible “Old Testament.” Look at his and the Jewish story 1 Jonah i. 3. 2 Jonah iii. 3, 4.

We have here a very clear narrative of the various events, which took place, but we must remember that the whole is written for a society bound to promote “Christian Knowledge,” and that in addition to his translations from the tablets, the author has added every anecdote or circumstance which can aid the biblical tales. The facts of Senakerib’s war are these. SENAKERIB’S ARMY.—In 702 B.C.. this monarch determined to re-subjugate Phe-nicia and “the land of the Hitties,”1 more especially with the view of stemming the advancing power of Egypt, without which the poor weak tribes to the south, Moabites, Hittites, Judeans, &c., never stirred. The King first attacked Phenicia and effectually subdued it, making its king flee for safety to Cyprus—called by Asyrians Yatnan—when Senakerib put his own nominee on the throne of Zidon, and then marched down along all the coast, as the richest and strongest part of the land as far as Askalon, when, hearing of a Hitto-Egyptian force which had escaped him, he countermarched north, and met and utterly annihilated it near Ekron. Hezekiah, a ruler in the town of I-Er-u-salem, hearing this, obsequiously tendered his submission when the monarch “having shut him up like a caged bird,”2 on his eyry, as is stated in the tablets of the Empire, proceeded to attack seriatim the fortified strongholds to the south, and when encamped before Lakish near Ziglag, he recceived from the bewildered Hezekiah all the wealth of gold and temple, sacred though they were to Jahveh, as tribute. Having subdued the land, and punished and restrained Egypt, the Emperor returned to Nineveh, no doubt passing the humbled “city of Hezekiah” on his way, “bearing with him,” say the tablets, “all his tribute and spoil;” and Mr George Smith therefore truly adds that “not a single shadow of reverse or disaster appears in. the whole narrative.” Thus then there was no “angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Asyrians 185,000” warriors so that “when they arose early in the morning they were all dead corpses.” !3 Neither, in fact, by implication or otherwise can any confirmation be obtained as to this reckless statement, which, if true, would have been repeated to us through a score of extraneous channels, for it would have caused the dissolution of the reigning dynasty, if not the immediate destruction of the monarchy; Egypt would have returned to her old conquest, and Merodak-Baladan, late King of Babylon, who only crouched waiting his opportunity amidst “the marches of the Persian gulf,”4 would have flown at the throat of the humbled lion of the north, and every other province of the wide Empire, from Armenia and Media to Phenicia, struck boldly for independence. In spite of such powerful reasons, if indeed in the absence of facts any were needed, Mr. Smith still thinks it proper to countenance the biblical tale, so he 1 Geo. Smith’s Assyria, Soc. P. Christ.

"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 107relates a wild tradition, that on one occaaion in the time of Sethos, King of Egypt, the bow-strings of an army of Senakerib’s near Pelusium, were eaten one night by field mice, in answer to an invocation made to the Egyptian gods!1 This is called by our historian a circumstance “in singular agreement with the statement in the Bible,” and “confirming it”! though Pelusium on the Nile is a long way from Jerusalem, and a mouse biting bow-strings for Osiris and Isis, scarcely like “an angel of the Jahveh” acting, as Christians are taught to believe, for the Almighty ruler of the whole universe. The cruelty of slaughtering 185,000 innocent men—at least twice as many as ex-isted in the whole little Jewish capital, is here also lost sight of. Mr Rawlinson, who tells us frequently that he has not permitted himself to em-bellish his narratives, and so outrage history with a pillar or picture from either Layard or Fergusson—writers who are not in the habit of importing fictitious matter into their books—deliberately asks us also to believe, without one iota of evidence, this absurd Jewish tale, adding that it is a miracle like the destruction of the first- born of Egypt! Yea, verily, and equally supported! “It is difficult,” continues the Canon, to say “how soon Senakerib recovered from this terrible blow, his annals omit it altogether, and represent the monarch as engaged in a continuous series of successful campaigns”2! which reads almost like quiet irony, for the author, once more an historian, makes Senakerib tell us of all his doings in great detail. He says, so detailed and accurate are this King’s records, that he begins them always: “On my first campaign,” &c., and yet, this accurate recorder has not a word about this most wondrous miracle! The pious Jewish author of “Tobit” kills the great King “within fifty-five days of his return to Nineveh;” and Josphus at once annihilates the Asyrian Empire after “the Lord’s slaughter” of 185,000, but these are not inspired writers like our unknown “Kings,” so their statements are called “exaggerations rashly credited by some moderns.”! After stating all this Mr. Rawlinson goes on to describe to us the grandest feats of arms Asia had ever yet witnessed, although the conqueror had tamely submitted to the incomprehensible rebuff and slaughter of an amy before a small town on the Syrian hills. Senakerib, and hig great son Eser-hadon after him, were the first Asyrian mon-archs who ventured to pursue their flying foes into the islands of the Mediterranean Sea. We are told that when King Abed-Melkarth (servant of Herakles) revolted, he was pursued even to Cyprus—here called Aradus—and captured by Eser-hadon, whom the imperial records say “traversed the sea like a fish.” Neither was a king of the wild Lebanon ranges—Sandoo-ara, more secure among his mountain fastnesses; Eser-hadon pursued him there, and rested not until he was captured.2 ESERHADON.—This great monarch asceuded the throne of an empire extending from the lands of the Aryans east of the Persian Gulf to the shores of the Mediter-ranean, and added thereunto by the grandest expeditions. He led a great army into central Arabia, traversing 490 miles of sandy desert with only the food and water 1 [Herod. II. 141.] 2 Anc. Mons.

Arabia has been deeply penetrated thrice only in the history of the world, and Eser-hadon is the sole monarch who ever ventured to conduct in person such an attack.”1 The following year he marched all over Egypt to No or Thebes, and prolaimed himself King of Asyria, and Emperor of Babylon, Egypt, Meroe, and Ethiopia. He parcelled out all Egypt under kings mostly of his own nomination, and subject to his Viceroy ruling from Memphis. Neko an Egyptian, and Father of Psametik I., was his nominee. There is allusion in his annals to the petty rulers in Judea and Samaria, and these “Chronicles” speak of one Manasses revolting, when one of Eser-hadon’s generals “at once laid hold of him (as if he had been a Sheep!) and taking him among the thorns, bound him with chains and carried him to Babylon.”2 Peradventure Yahveh was asleep, as Jews mock- ingly said on such occasions, and forgot the energy which “slaughtered Senakerib’s hosts.”3 Fortunately for the Jews, Eser-hadon had never heard of that tale, or there would have been much more weeping and wailing in Jewish lands; as it was, the Syrian states were so thinly populated that this monarch “gathered men from Babylon, Erech, Soosa, Elymais, Persia, and other neighbouring regions,” and had them conveyed to Syria, and there settled them over the whole country—which until this time (670 B.C.) must have been very thinly peopled;4 indeed it always has been, though Jewish records would have us believe otherwise, for nowhere do Jews exaggerate more absurdly than when they speak grandiloquently of the power and population of their own little tribes; even our most orthodox clerical writers say that their exaggerations here are “so childish, that it is surprising anyone could have repeated then.”5 This quotation refers principally to the population of Jerusalem, and the statement of Josephus that “a million perished in the siege, and a hundred thousand escaped!” The old walls of Jerusalem, says this writer, “never could have exceeded 750,000 square yards,” which, “at the probable number of one person to fifty square yards, gives 15,000 as the total population”6! In the dap of Agrippa the area rose to 2,250,00 square yards, and the population, adds the orthodox author, may have then risen to 30,000 persons. Everything connected with Jewish statistics is equally exaggerated. Let us look a little into the facts. JEWISH POWER.—The area of Judea and Samaria, according to the above authority, 140 × 40 = 5600 square miles (?) which I think is certainly one-fourth too much, my own triangulation of it giving only 4500, or a fignre of about 130 × 35. I will, however, concede the allotment of 5600, but we must re- member that, as a rule, the whole is a dismal, rocky, arid region, with only in-tersecting valleys,7 watered by springs and heavy rain from November to February 1 Rawlinson. 2 2 Chron. xxxiii. 3 1 Kings xviii. 27. 4 This is acknowledged in Anc.

Even the inhabitable portions of the country could only support the very sparsest population, and I speak after hav-ing marched over it, and also a considerable portion of the rest of the world. In India we should look upon it as a very poor province; in some respects very like the hilly tracts of Mewār or Odeypoor1 in Rajpootana, but in extent, population, and wealth, it is less than that small principality. The chief importance of Palestine in ancient history was due to its lying on the high road between the great kingdoms of Egypt, Babylon, and Asyria, and as giving the Arabs a hiding and abiding place which they—Jews included—could not obtain if they ventured out on the plains south and east. The “holes” and fastnesses of the hills were their safeguards, and as they assure us, very much used indeed.2 The Jewish strip is divided into Samaria as a centre, with Galilee north and Judea south, giving to the two former 8-10ths, and the latter 2-10ths, that is, two tribes; so that the Judean area would be about 1025600× = 1120 square miles, against the 1085600×= 4480 to the latter, and the population would also be somewhat in this proportion,3 for the extreme barrenness of all the country south and east or Jerusalem would be in some degree made up for by this town being perhaps a little larger than thoe in the north.4 We are thus prepared to state the population of the entire land in terms of its area, as was done for the Judean capital, and with equally startling results. The whole Turkish empire yields at present less than twenty-four persons to the square mile, and in the wild and warring area we are here concerned with, we may safely say that there were less than twenty per square mile, of which half were female, and one-third of the other half, children and feeble persons unable to take the field, whether for war or agriculture. The result is disastrous to much biblical matter, and far reaching; upsetting the mighty armies of Joshua and the Judges, no less than those of David and Solomon, who are thought for a few short years to have united the tribes; nay, the stern facts of figures destroy all the subsequently divided kings or petty chiefs who lasted down to the sixth century or so B.C., and show us that Jews have ever been insignificant in the extreme, especially when compared with the great peoples who generally ruled them, and far and wide around them. The total population was probably about 5600 × 20 = - - 112,000Deduct one-half as females - - - - - - 56,000 Do. one-third as males under fifteen, and ofter fifty, see Rawlinson’s estimate3 of the available male strength of Persia 356000= 18, 670     ———     74,670          ———Balance of males available from all the tribes for the purposes of govemment, 37,330 1 Odeypore is about 150 × 50 = 6500 square miles, and probably three times as densely populated as Samaria and Judea.

In general, the tribes warred with one another, and with their neighbours, so that, for the purposes of foreign war, the Jewish race represented only two or three tribes at a time, or say, 10,000 able men. Thus one tribe—as, for examplet Juda—would have only from 3000 to 4000 men in all, supposing every man left his fields and home to fight! while Asyrian armies not unusually numbered 100,000 to 200,000 men.1 In the above statistics, also, we have taken a greater area than I think the tribes occupied. PURITY OF CASTE.—In regard to their being “a peculiar people” if this means any special purity of blood or lineage, it is a complete delusion which all history dissipates. I have pointed out how all their conquerors mixed them again and again with others. The Asyrian monarchs of the seventh and eighth centuries acted precisely as Sargon said he did, so as to improve by immigration their western Satrapy; they “sent up upon the land colonists from Hamath, Babylon, Kooth, Sipara, and Iva,”2 and these were all Arabs, or at least Shemites like themselves in blood, and differing little in language, so that the mixing in those days would be intimate and thorough. Deportations also took place, so it is folly to speak of “God’s holy and peculiar people” either as two tribes or twelve; and wonderful is the misdirected zeal which has endeavoured to find out “the ten lost tribes,” who, if any such ever existed, would be absorbed among their Arabian congeners—ever predominating from “Araby the Blest” to the ranges of Media and the Taurus. The Jews confess that only a few of their “brave men” ever returned from Mesopotamia, and this is not to be wondered at, seeing that again and again they were everywhere seized as slaves and captives and taken away to other lands, to build palaces or shrines, “draw water; or hew wood;” indeed the dwellers on the Syrian Highlands have ever been the product of all lands, from the Nile to the mountains of Persepolis. If Jews ever made head, as they affirm, under one David, who they state rose as a robber-chief to considerable power whilst Asyria rested after the energetic reign of conquest by Tiglath-Pileser I., it must have been but for a short time. The real rule of all these parts, when not under Egypt or Asyria, emanated Da-mascus-ways. The city of the goddess Rimon, and not Zion, was the real capital of the country. Phenicians cared only for their fertile sea-board and sea trade, and rarely interfered with the Highlanders unless disturbed. Even Jewish records state that in the beginning of the tenth century B.C., Rezin, king of Damascus, ruled over all the northern country, no doubt as much as he wished; for the barren crags about Jerusalem were never much sought after. His successor, Benhadad II. of Damascus, took all Judea for a short time; but we see from the campaign of Senakerib over all the lowlands, that as a rule the powerful kingdoms left alone the hilly tracts, just as Romans left alone Welshmen in England and Highlanders north of the Forth in Scot-land; like the latter, Jews had barely garments to cover themselves, and lived, as 1 Anc.

Under their Shemitic confreres—Mahomedans—they shared little better, being ruled with a rod of iron, or driven forth among “Kafers,” as the fanatics of the fuith call the outside world. Poor slaves and outcasts! the “peculiar people” have at last proved good traders, and prefer, like wise men, all other lands to their own, notwithstanding their sentimental talk regarding it. Like us all, they prefer dwelling at peace and on equal terms with their neighbours. Neither war, administration, nor yet religion has ever been their forte, for although they have had a few pious writers who have left us some beautiful words and ideas—as which people have not? these were few and far between, and but little heeded in their own or adjacent times, as they piteously tell us. Sometimes these good Jews tried to urge their tribes by hope of reward, at other times to intimidate them by fearful cursings; all, however, that we admire in these writers, the people of their day clearly laughed at, or, at all events, never followed, but, on the contrary, adhered consistently to their Betyls and “Grove,” Ark, Serpent, Ephods, and Talismans, until advancing education and civilisation all around moved them too. Dire though the clash of nations in war be for a time, yet it is nature’s rude remedy, and upon the whole successful as regards the general advancement of a people. The arms and wars of Rome, nay, even of Gengis Kan, did good, and so did the vicissi-tudes of the Jews improve them. The Maccabees were better than David and all previous rulers, as the wise Hillel and pure minded Christ, were superior to all previous Jewish “prophets” and writers. But enough. To return to Asyria. COMMUNITY OF GODS.—Esarhadon, like other kings, when he seized a country, took away the gods and set them up in his own land, with the usual ceremonies of bap-tism and reconsecration, on some occasions he was willing to give them back again for a “consideration,” which, he stated, must be closer union and a higher amount of tribute. “The holy poople” were not free from this love for “strange gods,” or “gods of strangers,” probably inheriting this from their Arabian mother, for all Arabs stole gods, and Jews seized the gods of Mount Seir and Petra, &c. and “served them;” and Solomon seems to have collected all the gods from the Nile to the Euphrates, and placed them in the temple and holy mounts around his capital. History in cylinders, tablets and monuments, &c., would have been sure to tell us if there was any material differ-ence betwixt the gods of all these divers nations. The Betyls of Jews and Phenicians conveyed the same idea as the Noor-hags of Sardinia, and “the black stone” or Helioga-belus of Emesa was but a form of that of Meka, as both still are of those in India, while Benares still boasts of the Apis, which weaker Egypt was compelled to suppress. The monarch of Persia could do there, twenty-one and a-half centuries ago, what all 1 1 Sam. xiii., and elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 112the power of Britain durst not presume to do this day in Benares, viz., stab a temple Apis; the great Persian, however, is believed to have perished for his sacrilegious deed. If the symbol of the Creative Father was so reverenced, not less so was the female energy. The Ishtar of Asyria was equally known and revered with the Isis of the Nile, and the Dea Syria of Hira on the Euphrates, and these had representatives in Askalon, on the Orontes. the Araxes, Oxus, and abundantly on the Tiber and every other Eu-ropean stream. Then indeed, and never since, at least not for the last eighteen hundred years, has the Western world known of unity of faith; before that time all used to pride themselves like Jews on their own special divinities, and seek no addi-tional worshippers save those of blood. They seized each others gods, but only to punish or subdue a people, because these were what the conquered valued most; as when Asher-bani-pal determined to completely subdue Soosana, and render it a sat-rapy of his Babylonian vice-royalty, he carried aw.ay the gods of Soosa and put them into the temples of Babylon. Thus, though the monarch here produced unity, there was neither love, mercy, nor charity, which we have at last begun to value more than what is called “Religion.” It was quite understood that Amon of Egypt was fairly represented by Asher of Asyria, and that the faith of the Upper Tigris and Euphrates was as reasonably called Asherite, as that of the Nile was Amonite. In the seventh century B.C., the Asyrian monarch carried Egyptian Sphinxes into his country, but such placid-looking abstract deities did not suit the genius of the Asyrians, and we therefore hear nothing more about the Sphinx. Phenicians, the conquerors of the great ancient race we learn so much of as Aithiopians, delighted in the worship of Ba-al or Bel, and probably left this inheritance to Babylonians and their successors when driven from that land, though Shemites equally and faithfully clung to Bel till the Arabian Kalifs forbade them. To tell of ancient kings and their wars is to actually describe faiths and the progress of these; thus Asher-bani-pal, or “the Lingam, the son of the Lingam,” or “Asher, the head of Lingam worshippers,” warred, we are told, with Amon-Rad, King of Egypt, or the Lingam leader of the Nile; and we find him fighting with Ba-el, King of Tyre and Sidon and so on; each leader’s name denoting a faith and its repre-sentative emblem; in fact, the king was only there to represent the emblem and con-tinue the faith, and was bound to support all temples and ecclesiastics. So Nebo-Pal-Ashir, or Nepoo-pal-esar signifies Nebo or Ninip, the head of the Lingamites, “protects my Son,” or “my Pal, the Asher,” or male emblem worshippers. A Solo-phallic king was called Bel-shazar, or rather Bel-Sar-asher, which Bel we find occasionally is translated as “the Secret God,” or “Guardian of the Secrets,” while Sar is the Sun. Ziri, “the seed,” is very often compounded, as in the kingly name, Merudook-Shapik-ziri, or Am-ar-ut, who “pours forth seed,” or “produces offspring.”1 Esarhadon handed over, in 668 B.C., a prosperous and magnificent empire to his eldest son, Asher-bani-pal, the Sar-dana-palus of the Greeks, who still more increased 1 Anc.

Like his predecessors, he marched all over Egypt and most of Arabia, and swept his southern borders clear of every opposing Arab tribe, from the Gulf of Petrea or Sea of Aka, to all round the head of the Persian Gulf. Neither his conquering father nor grandfather had attempted the complete reduction of Soosana, so Asherbanipal1 set about this both by river and land, and in a very short time marched triumphantly through the capital, nay, the palaces and temples, and penetrating even into the “Holy of Holies,” he removed from thence the national gods. The goddess Nana of Erek, which Elamites had taken and kept in their Shushan shrine ever since 1635, he seized and gave back to the delighted Baby-lonians; but he thus mortally offended the conquered, who not unreasonably claimed it as theirs, after holding it against all the powers of Kaldian and Babylonian kings for upwards of one thousand years.2 He had also insulted the great national deity by gazing upon what “no man should see and live,” so that, great and powerful as he was, his dominion, and the very nane of Asyria, was doomed for ever in the eyes of Soos-anians, and they have always been a powerful race, who, even when beaten, usually commanded their own term. Asher-bani-pal was not, however, one with whom they could attempt this; he marched through their vales and over their mountains, “leaving Elam a desert,” although when they were in famine straits he fed them. In Cilicia, this king raised Tarsus (which his grandfather, Senakerib, is said to have founded) to great wealth and importance, doubtless intending it to compete with Tyre in the rich trade of the Mediterranean coasts. He greatly restored the old capital of his kingdom—Sher-gat or Asher,—adding to its sacred shrine, called by him Sadi-Matuti, that is, I fancy, the goddess Sidi (Sidh) or Ceres, whom our ancestors were wont to worship, as will appear in my chapter on Koothites and Kelts. This monarch, like great Cesar, principally worshipped Ishtar or Venus, but he beautified the temples in the cities of Babylon, Nineveh, Haran, Arbela, and Tarbezi, as will be found duly recorded chronologically in my tables; but that for which we value Asher-banipal most is his diligent collection of tablets, originals and copies, in the great library at Kouyunjik, Nineveh, on which I have already dwelt at some length. FALL OF ASYRIA.—Asur-bani-pal appears to have passed peacefully away in 626 B.C., when the throne was occupied for a troublesome year or two by one Bel-zakar-iskun, of whom little is known, although he met bravely all the old king’s enemies, of whom Psametikus of Egypt and Phraortes of Media. were the most formid-able. The latter—sometimes called Deioke3—encountered Asyria in fair battle, but was defeated and slain, only, however, to be succeeded by his great son, Kuaxares, before whose valour, military genius and pertinacity, the old empire eventually fell, but not in this king’s reign; it required a combination of the great powers, for the Asyrian 1 [The print edition had “Esarhadon,” this has been corrected as an obvious slip. — T.S.] 2 Geo. Smith’s Assyria, chap. xiv.

It is uncertain when Bel-zakir-iskun died, but he was succeeded by Asur-Ebil-ili, whom Greeks called Sarakas, a son of the great Asur-bani-pal, who saw the dread game played out, for now our historic clock chimes the fatal hour of “seventh century,” and gives note of warn-ing that the great empire which rose about 1270 B.C., must now prepare to die.1 The electro-historic wave is about to burst over it from east and west, north, and south; surg-ing multitudes, like welling-up waters, are everywhere preparing to pour forth—physic-ally strong, though intellectually inferior to those in the centres of Asyrian civilisation; yet Asyria’s day has gone, perhaps, because it had now no other role to play in the progress of mankind; like a plant it had reached its full maturity and was incapable of greater beauty or usefulness; and as mankind must advance, it was ruthlessly cut down to give place to others who, for long, were its inferiors. ARYAN ASCENDANCY.—Aryan thought is now advancing on all sides. In the West a Pythagoras, and in the East a Boodha and Laotsi, are expressing the advancing views of great peoples. Aryan Zoroastrians, Medes and other non-Aryans, are now to be seen amalgamating with Armenian Magians, and these two—always independent, and in 634 somewhat powerful kingdoms, then make their first essay against the Lion of Asyria, though, as already stated, not at first successfully. The Medes, however, under Kuaxeres, returned to the contest, and succeeded in defeating the Asyrians and investing Nineveh. But the Skuthians caused the siege to be raised, for, descending in clouds through Media and Armenia, they soon covered all the lands of the Asyrian Empire, except Egypt whose king, Psametikus, met them at Askalon in Syria, and by open force or craft, or both, turned the wave north, when it spread itself out over Southern Europe. Let us pause a little over these waves of northern immigrants, for they are the parents of Europe, and more immediately important to us than even the early western empires. Mr Rawlinson thinks the Skuthic invasions occurred like “a species of fatality, a law whose workings we cannot trace. . . . There issues, from time to time,” he says, “out of the frozen bosom of the North, vast hordes of uncouth savages—brave, hungry, countless—who swarm into the fairer southern regions determinately, irresistibly, like locusts winging their flight into a green land. How such multitudes come to be propagated in countries where life is with difficulty sustained, we do not know; why the impulse suddenly seizes them to quit their old haunts, and move steadily in a given direction, we cannot say; but we see that the phenomenon is one of constant recurrence, and we therefore now scarcely regard it as being curious and strange at all.”2 Of course it is a law, and it would be a miracle if 1 The rise of Empire was . . . . .

"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 115the pent-up productive energy of the great Central Asian races did not seek an outlet. If Great Britain sends abroad, as she probably does, nearly an eighth of a million annually, why should we not expect the rich vales of the Oxus, Jaxartes, and Danube to send a million or two every hundred years or so to their south and west in quest of “fresh fields and pastures new.” It is said that the emigration from Germany alone dwiug the five years ending 1873, has been upwards of one million, or at the annual rote of 200,000, while from the United .Kingdom in 1875, 150,000 persons went to New York; from Ireland alone, between 1st May 1851 and 31st December 1875, upwards of 2,377,391 souls emigrated, or very nearly at the enormous average of 100,000 annually for twenty-four and a-half years. In some years the figures rose as high as 150,000, 170,000, and once even to 190,322 from this one small island.1 The superfluous populations of early time could not as now set out in small bands for fear of being cut to pieces, nor could they settle anywhere unless they clove a path for themselves by the sword; they therefore, when pressed for room or driven onwards by others, acted like locusts, migrating in crowds and destroying all before them. They had to consider well their warlike arrangements, and select wise and war-rior chiefs—great generals like Gengis Kan. They went forth with no idea of showing mercy to any other races and certainly not to those whose lands they desired to possess, for their object was to destroy and dispossess others of their just rights and properties as Jahveh told his “chosen people” to do. Their going forth therefore meant blood, fire, and desolation, and no quarter, and in such way went forth those we call Kuklops, Koothites, Hamites, Sakæ, Kymri, etc., and before them unknown Turanian races and. those Skuthic hordes whose movements we are considering. In Europe those whom we call Kelts, Goths, etc., settled, mixing with Avurs, Huns, Alans, Vandals, Gatæ, Lombards, Bulgarians, etc., as had Etruskans, Ambrians, Oskans of the Turanian family done before them. SKUTHIA.—All peoples have so emigrated in great hordes at some stage of their existence, and historians merely speak of the horrors of Skuthic invasions, because this is the earliest true historic experience of such, our limited vision has yet embraced. We know a good deal regarding Skuthic migrations into Europe and the Panjab about the 6th and 7th centuries B.C., something of that of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries B.C., and a very little as to another great move about the twenty-fourth cen-tury B.C. The wave of 630 B.C. utterly desolated Asyria. These Skuths found, says Rawlinson, Iberia and Media a garden and left behind them, in their passage south-wards, a howling wilderness; it was they, under the name of Kymri or Kelts, who desolated Lydia, and, says Herodotus, made themselves at this time masters of the whole of Western Asia, from the Caucasus to the borders of Egypt. In the course of a few years the civilised nations got rid of the savages, who settled down as vassals, or submitted to be located in particular provinces or townships, as in the case of the Sakrsine of Armenia, Skuthopolis of Syria, and many places bordering on Hindostan. 1 Lon.

Seven centuries A.C. we had the terrific Shemitic cycle, led by Moslem pro-pagandists, and again five to six centuries, after that, much disturbance in European thought, and in the East the great Mongol tide led by Gengis Kan, and after him by Kablai Kan. These waves divide the twenty-four centuries B.C., and the twelve cen-turies A.C., into six pretty equal parts, and are marked by broad pale bands in my Chart. The Skuthians, we are told, travelled and fought in clans, all subject to one royal tribe corresponding to the “Golden Horde” of the Mongols; they had kings who ruled by hereditary rights; and though many ruled, yet the supreme power was always lodged in the hands of a. single man.1 When known to history these wild Nomads worshipped, as we should anticipate, “the sun, moon, fire, earth, air, and water,” and also Herakles as representative creating man, in fact Asher or Mahadeva, for Herodotus means by Herakles him of Phenicia, whose symbol was a pillar, or more commonly and grossly a phallus; as warriors, however, the Skuthians worshipped the naked sword, just as an illiterate lancer of the east does his lance. “The Father of History” says, in regard to the religion of the Skuthians, that each district had a raised altar or place of worship and sacrifice, being an heap of fagots three stades in length and breadth, vertical on three sides, but sloped down on the other as an approach.2 On this particular pile was built a platform, which received yearly one hundred and fifty waggon-loads of fagots. Each tribe here affixed a scimitar or sword, and sac-rificed at its base horses and cattle, or if any prisoners of war were available, “each tribe cut one man’s throat, and poured the blood over the scimitar, when the body was hacked to pieces, and thrown about.” The Adam of the Skuthians, according to Herodotus,3 was called Targitaus—the offspring of Zeus, and a river goddess Borystenes, so that here too we have the old faith of all nations, viz., in Sun or Fire, and Water or Salacia. Targitaus had three sons, Lip-oxais, Ap-oxais, and Kol-oxais; we should much like to know what Lip, Ap, and Kol mean. Heaven gave these children a yoke, an axe, and a golden bowl, but only the younger Kol seems to have used these freely, and so taught his people to be agriculturalists. Vesta—no doubt the golden bowl, was the favourite Skuthian goddess; after her came Jupiter, and his wife the earth; then Apollo, Venus-Ourania; then Herakles and Mars 1 Anc. Mons. II. 512. 2 Herodotus, IV. 62. If the stade = 200 yards, this Skuthic altar must have been a huge pile, say 1200 yards, and this even if Herodotus means only the circumference. The mounds of all these peoples were huge; the circuit of some mounds was as follows:— Nineveh = 1900 yards. Perseopolis = 1526 ,, Soosa = 1333 ,, Kouyoonjik = 2000 ,, Nimrood = 1900 ,, 3 Herodotus IV. 5.

Venus-Urania = Artimpasa. Earth = Apia or Mapia. Apollo = Etosyras. Neptune = Thamimasades. Only to Mars did they erect images, altars, and temples.1 They had diviners with rods, like Moses and the Egyptians, whose fiat was life or death, and they sternly prohibited all drunken festivals in honour of Bacchus.2 Among this people, then, we find exactly the faiths and practices which we would expect in the fathers of the great races who, in India and all Western Asia. and Southern Europe, soon grew into mighty peoples, subduing all before them, and mostly replacing the aborigines; to them we have the faiths of Europe and innumerable existing practices. Papeus and Apia (probably Pa and Ma) were the Phallic parents of the race, and Vesta was that fire which produced their great Apollo and unlovely Venus. To her some tribes offered up human beings, as in the case of Iphigenia.3 From the earliest pre-historic times, then, we find such faiths and peoples increasing and bearing full sway all through Central Asia, and ever and anon piercing into the south and west through the vast natural barriers which in vain confined them to the high plains or rolling steppes of their great primitive continent, and spreading in a mighty and at first desolating flood over quieter and less energetic nations. The same author who describes the Phallic faiths of these races, also tells us of the vast extent of their kingdoms and power. They spread, he says, from the Carpathian Mountains, in Central Europe, to away over all Baktra; so that here from unknown times, to the time of the Median monarchy, we find our second faith bearing undoubted sway. Herodotus adds, that after pouring in cloudy masses during the seventh century B.C. through Iberia and Media, they then overran and held for twenty-eight years the whole of Western Asia from the Caucasus to the borders of Egypt.4 This extensive southern Asiatic dominion, however, does not accord with what other peoples say of their role, and Herodotus is thus held to have given an exaggerated chronology. It seems as if Asyria had attempted to rebuild her cities; for Sarakas then erected a palace at Kāla, and restored the famous temple of Nebo, here called Bet-Sidda5 or the male Ceres. Kuaxares fought and repelled the Skuthian hordes of his day, after they had become weakened by division and constant warfare, for his Median mountain strongholds no doubt escaped better than the old and rich cities and towns of the Asyrian empire, and it was only owing to the weakness and utter prostration of the people whom these Skuths had overrun, that Kuaxares was so easily able to march to empire; moun-tainous wild races do not suffer so much, nor take so long to recover as a settled monarchy. 1 Herodotus, IV. 59.   2 Ibid., IV. 79. 3 Ibid., IV. 103.    4 Ibid., I. 106, and IV. 1. 5 Assyria, by Geo.

The descendant of Assur-bani-pal, however, appears still to have been a worthy scion of the great race; for Diodorus and Ctesias tell us that this enormous army was repulsed and routed, and that other two attacks were equally unsuccessful. For two years Sarakas kept the field, beating off all opponenents; but at last a Baktrian armyjoined the Mede, for the prize was an empire, and the loss annihilation. A night attack on the king finally proved success-ful, and the wearied-out monarch had to retire within his ramparts. Still he held out against all his enemies for two years more, and it was only after a three-years’ siege, that in 607 B.C. he succumbed to an unuaually wet season, during which the river rose and swept away a considerable length of the city walls, when Sarakas retired with all his household into his palace, where, making a funeral pile, (alas! for the valuable libraries and treasures of art), he and his family mounted it and perished in the flames. It is undoubted that the empire would not have fallen with Sarakas, but for the great Sku-thic movements of this period. ASYRIAN CHARACTER.—I have thus sketched the history and faith of the Asy-rians, and shown clearly that, like all the peoples of Western Asia, they were Solo-phallic worshippers, though not in a very gross and indecent manner. A few words here as to the general character of the people. Not only were they great in their ideas, but patient and laborious in working these out beyond any of their time. They cared, says Rawlinson, more for the useful than the onramental, and the actual than the ideal. Architecture and sculpture were their favourite arts, and he was esteemed the greatest artist who was most true to history and fact in his delineations. Hence, if not always true to perspec-tive light and shade, Asyrian sculpture is of the greatest value because laboriously zaccurate and true to nature. The empire which was now to succeed them was Aryan, but it was very different, rude, and short-lived. ASYRIAN REVENUES.—Although no real divisions into Satrapies were known before the sixth century B.C.—a system first introduced by the Akaimenian Persian empire—yet, by going backwards, we may calculate by Satrapies the revenues of Asyria in its declining days, at about 2700 to 28001 talents, which, if wa value each at about £350, gives only £980,000, equal probably to £1,500,000 according to the present value of money;2 but this, of course, was only tribute from very independent rulers towards a central imperial govermnent. Each of the seven Satrapies provided its own “ways 1 Cilicia, . . . . . . Syria, . . . . . . . Half Egypt . . . . . . Soosania . . . . . . Talents, 500 ,, 350 ,, 350 ,, 300Asyria and Babylon, . . .

If they paid a tribute of one and a-half million, their own revenues may possibly have been sixteen to twenty times this. MEDIA.—The Median. Empire,. making a long truce with Babylon on its south, Lydia on its west, and Iran or Persia on its east, ruled, for the lifetime of an ordinary man, over no less than 500,000 square miles; its greatest length east and west being about 1300 miles, with an average width of about half this, and with a revenue from Sa-trapies even greater than Asyria had.1 The Median nation, when first known to true history, had what is usually called the Magian faith, of which Fire was the outward and principal symbol; but its votaries venerated Air and Water, and loved Herakles or Mars, Varoona or Ouranos, and Venus, etc. They hnd no great objections to the Asyrian or Mesopotamian faiths, and seem to have pliantly accepted the sacred figures on all the palaces and temples of the old monarchies, although strictly conforming to the injunctions of their much feared Magian and magic-working priests, who had many mysterious and. imposing rites in connection with holy rods, wands, Barsom twigs, etc., of which even we are not yet quite free. Stern, rude, and hardy mountaineers as they were, they seem to have soon suc-cumbed to the luxury of the courts and peoples whom they conquered. It is commonly said that the corruption of the priesthood, and the entire subordination of the people to them, was the principal cause why the nation was so short-lived, for they attained independence about 650, empire about 600, and by 560 the fiat had gone. forth that Median or Armenian Magianism was to give way to something far greater —the second Book-faith of Man, Long pent up in the vales and water-sheds of the Oxus, a mighty and a spiritual faith had developed itself, which many centuries before had silently permeated all the high-lands of India. This faith had now created war and turmoil in all the valleys of the Ganges, and had also succeeded in firmly establishing itself in the ancient kingdom of Persia, there to break forth under a great general—the first of the Akaimenian dynasty of kings, who ruled all good Zoroastrians from his capital Pesargade. Now was Aryan, Median, and Shemitic Babylon and Asyria to stand and listen to something new. Great spiritual ideas had been everywhere heard of; Boodha, Laotzee, Confucius, Pythagoras, Thales, and thousands of followers had been everywhere preaching, and though kings, courtiers and warriors are seldom very atrentive listeners to such matters at first, yet as the sixth century B.C. dawned, great multitudes had been moved, and kings were obliged to act. The father of Kuaxares may have felt the movement and been pushed down south in 634 by north Aryan pressure when he descended on Asyria, for we see that Phraortes and his son were pursued and passed over by Skuthian hordes, who for many years had both father and son in thrall. Eventually Kuaxares stemmed the fierce torrent, blotted out the old monarchy, consolidated his own, and 1 Anc. Mons. III. 234."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 120then re-established that of Babylon. Yet both were to stand but for the lifetime of one man, and then give place to a stern, if not very pure Theism, a “Revealed book,” and written faith, and such good tidings of love to all mankind as had never yet been spoken of to western nations. India and China1 had bestirred themselves, and risen to much true advancement under such teaching as Western Asia was now to listen to, but this I will more particularly treat of under Zoroastrianism, the western form which Vedantism took. At present we must look a little more closely at our new conquerors —the Medes. MEDIAN ORIGIN.—In our ignorance of ancient history, we are apt to fancy that the Medes only lived in the ninth century B.C., because we can only find Asyrians mentioning them then. Berosus tells us that the Medes conquered Babylon anterior to 2000 B.C., and that their monarchy there lasted for two hundred and twenty-four years. Now Berosus was a Kaldian, and therefore not likely to exaggererate in regard to the subjection of his race to a foreign yoke. The tenth chapter of Genesis also speaks of the Madai in conjunction with Gomer, Magog, &c.; and those accepting this book as history will of course not object to the date given by Berosus. They must place these Madai prior to 1500 B.C., and thus allow that Medes were known to so obscure a person as a wandering Shemite of the Idumean desert—Moises-osar-seph, the Jewish priest. The Medes were thought by Bunsen to be one of the earliest races of men, and many writers trace them back to the twenty-third century B.C. In Arrian the name of a Mede or Persian is given as Ariook,2 ]wyra; and in Genesis we read that “Ariook (the lion-man) was king of Ella-sar,” rca-la, “the high oak,” or people worshipping Asher (the tree Lingam) or Ligneus penis as a god. We know that a nation from high Media had ruled from the earliest times in ancient Kaldia; see the early parts of this chapter and my chronological table. Rawlinson agrees that the Boorboors, who were driven out of Kaldia about the middle of the twenty-fifth century B.C., were Medes, but Mœdæ or Mœtæ may have been a sort of generic name for various tribes—Aryan, but more probably Turanian —who dwelt north and north-west of Asia Minor3; for we have Mœdi of Thrace, &c. All that can therefore be said is, that we clearly hear of Medes from the twenty-third to the ninth century B.C., but I think we should err if we asserted that they then inhabited the sacred cradle of Zoroastrianism—the Aryanem vaejo—for I can find no trace of Zoroastrian faith, or even of a heresy from that religion, among them till the ascendancy of the Akaimenian Persian dynasty about the Year 560 B.C. So much for the unknown Mede. Now let us turn to Median Government. MEDIAN RULE.—The Medes, at the time of conquering Asyria, were a rudely organised nation of hardy and vigorous mountaineers, apparently nomadic at first. The area of their country probably exceeded that of Great Britain and Ireland by one-fifth, 1 I allude to Confucianism and Taoism, which combined are a form of Boodhism. 2 Anc.

The whole country was mountain-ous, some peaks rising to 15,000 and even 20,000 feet above sea level, while 2000 feet was a common elevation. They particularly worshipped their great Hermon, El-Wad or El-Wand, “the Hill of God,” which was afterwards called Deva-Vend, equivalent to the Indian Sanskritists’ Maha-Deva. Many circumstances show us that the new rulers were great adorers of mountains, worshipping most frequently in their presence. As soon as they came to Empire, they fixed upon the sacred site of Ekbatāna or Eg, per-haps Agbatāna, from Fire, popularly translated “the place of the High God.” Per-sians call it Tukt-i-Sulam, or “throne of Salvation,” a term they commonly apply to lofty or pyramidal and sacred hills.1 The Medes selected Northern Ekbatana, of which the features as a holy city are noteworthy, and should be sketched to be under-stood. First, we have a great conical hill, at whose foot, but on the top of a circular Omphe or mound, lies a lake; adjoining this they placed the Palace of Dei-ok-es, or their King God, and clustering around these holy objects rose their great, prolific, and in many ways, peculiar city. All the country round they held sacred to El Rhea, calling it Rhagiana,2 for Rhea was their name for Beltis, taken, it is said, from her sacred number 15. The Medes also made southern Ekbatana a great capital, for Kuaxares is said to have here built that gorgeous palace of Queen Semiramis, which his successors completed, but the ruins of which archeologists have long sought for in vain. This Southern, or “Great Ekbatana,” the head-quarters of the later empire,3 now called Hamadan, or “City of Fire,” also adjoins a great El-wend or El-wad, a moun-tain some twelve miles long and rising in a gloriow peal to upwards of 10,000 feet high. Greeks called it Orontes, and on its southern base in the valley of the Kerba, a celebrated and holy river, there rises in pinnacled grandeur to some 1700 feet, the abrupt sculptured cliffs called Behistoon, but properly Bagistān,4 where the voluptuous queen is said to have erected her great Lingam Pillar and Palace. This was the “hill of Jove,” says Diodorus, and the house of God, or Beth-el, said the Shemitic Jew,5 which shows us the nature of the Jhavh he alone knew of in these early days. Every neighbouring tribe and race had here a sacred mountain range, and a peculiarly sacred peak, as well as one or more select, conical and ovate hills, at which the tribes were required to meet and worship. The great Hermon of the northern Caucasism races was El-burz or El-bruz, just such another as El-wad, but the former attains an elevation of 18,000 feet, and as the chain of which it is the apex runs east and west, and ter-minates in a very holy manner with the western extremity in the Euxine, and the eastern in the Caspian Sea, it is more specially revered. On the rocky precipices which here fall in masses into the Caspian, mythology tells us Prometheus, the primeval man-maker, was chained, and this is the spot the Sun seems to rise from over the great 1 Tukt = Throne, Peak, or Summit, and Soolam, “bliss” or “Salvation” as in I-Er-Sulam, Jeru-salem, &c.

Elburz is also called Minghi-Tau, in which we may see a word equivalent to the Sanskrit Mahi or Mahā, “great,” and in Tau, the great Ta of the Keltic races, and Toth, or Pillar God of Egypt. MEDIAN CHARACTER.—The Medes initiated that great Aryan ascendancy which had long ere this extended from its homes on the Oxus and Jaxartes, to the farthest sea coast of India and Persia, and which was now to push aside Shemitic peoples, till Mahomedanism should rise and give union in arms and faith to its own peculiar race. The new rulers showed their weakness for luxury and sensuality from the very first; any number of wives was permitted, while less than five was considered incorrect, if not unlawful. Of course eunuchs abounded and rose to great power, while art and the manly pursuits of the chase, which had ever distinguished the Asyrians, dwindled and decayed. Few specimens of sculpture remain as monuments of the Median empire, except perhaps winged genii, and some clumsy bulls and lions, showing us, as already said, that these symbols of Asyrian faith were revered by the Medes, as we should expect. It is, however, asserted by Strabo that Medes were not deficient in literature, and that the famous Persian educational system was wholly copied from Media.1 The Jewish writers of the books attributed to Daniel and Esther allude to Median literature; and we may almost be sure that much of what has come down to us in the shape of Magian lore, was first created by the Medes. History, however, whether that derived from Jewish or from other writings, is here in all respects most defective; the destruction of the great libraries of Asyria, and conse-quent scattering of the sage literateurs of the whole civilized world, produced a dead blank, which it took several generations to repair, and this lasted down to the time of Darius. The darkness or silence is here indeed so great that many have even doubted if such a person as Cyrus ever really existed; yet that he “was a real man, an historical character, whose flesh and bone no sublimating process will destroy,” we can now prove; though we cannot speak so certainly in regard to his grandfather, known as Astyages, whom report says he slew in order to secure his throne. Our great philologist has here satisfied himself, though he does not make it very clear, unless we remember that a thousand years after Cyrus, Moses of Korene gathered up the stories regarding one Zohad, in a way which confirms other known matter.2 Thus we learn that the serpent-king whom Vedic Aryans conquered, was hown as Ahi or Ahee, while the conqueror was Trita; and we read in very ancient Zend writings that their great ancestor Thraetana or Feridun slew this Azhi, otherwise called Ashi-dahaka, or shortly, Zo-hak, of which “Astyages” is but a corrupt “Persian form.” Thus Cyrus or Kur-esh signifies that a solar prince (for Cyrus means “Sun,” or leader of Solarites), slew, as other stories assure us is the case, about 559 B.C., one Astyages, and founded a purer faith. Astyages although in those times a not uncommon name, may merely mean an 1 Anc. Mons., III. 80. 2 Consult on all of this M.

Though abhorring all connection with Ahee, or Serpent faiths, yet like Medes he was an undoubted Solar-Fire worshipper, and would oppose all followers of Astyages as both East and West Aryans used clearly to call the serpent races they ejected. Whether the Eastern or Western tale was the earlier we know not, but most probably the former. MEDIAN FAITH.—I have no doubt that Medes at one time worshipped Serpents, but when here known to us, they were clearly adorers of the great elements as the Earth, Water, and occasionally Air, but especially Fire, as the most subtle, ethereal, incompre-hensible and powerful agent. They were averse to all temples or personification of the material things, or of Ormazd. Like our Parsee fellow subjects, they never allowed their hearth fires to be extinguished, nor would they even blow out any ordinary fire or candle; in Magian days, he who did so forfeited his life. We still see the remains—some very perfect—of the lonely Fire towers, which Greeks called Puraitheia, amidst the lofty hills of Armenia, Azerbijan, Koordis- tan, and Looristan, some of which were Dakmas, or “Towers of Silence,” having gratings for roofs, through which the bones fell when the body was destroyed. Some Medes offered animal, if not human sacrifces, though nought but the blood might be presented to the Fire, and nothing that was not formally and solemnly consecrated by the Magi, and with hymns to the Sun, just as is described by Jews in the sixth century or later, when the unknown author of Leviticus wrote. Only the Magus could hold the sacred Barsom1 aud pour out before the Lord the oil, the milk, and the honey. The Fire-God was called At-Ar, which may be Ag-Ar, or “the God Ag,” and the root of our word Altar, Irish Al-toir, Welsh Allor, or All-awr, “the stone of adoration,” or All-Arah,2 because stones were the things first ad-radh, or adored. From A-tar, the Median sacred fire, we have the great ritual portion of the Zenda-Vesta called the Atarvan or Atravan. The Magian priest was a most pompous and gorgeously arrayed person; his office was hereditary; he was called “the priest of the Most High God,” and his power and importance were tremendouS; he always walked in procession to his Pyretheia, says Rawlinson, with “a lofty air, stately dress and entourage of ceremonial magnificence, clad in white robes, and bearing on his head a tall felt cap,”3 which Herodotus calls a tiara, with long streaming lappets. Such would, of course, vastly impress rude and credulous races, and had no doubt often been seen by the captive Hebrews, which may have induced those of them who returned from eastern captivity about the 4th and 5th centuries B.C., to imitate these Magi, and assert that forms, rites, and laws coming from such an ancient and saintly race, were divine; for we observe that the writers of Genesis acknowledged Melok-Zedek to be a priest or the Most High God,4 and this 1 Described as a budle of tamarisk twigs. 2 The Druids, Ireland, by Rev. R. Smiddy, p. 28. 3 Anc. Mons., III., 126. Herodotus, I. 132. See Fig. 207, p. 77, as to his costume and insignia. 4 Gen. xiv. 18. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 124reverence clearly continued up to gospel days when the Magi are brought upon the scene to confirm the Godship of Christ, because the saintly “Zoradascht”1 is said to have prophesied this.. It seems probable that at first the Magi were only one of the first six Median tribes who, making Fire their special deity, became eventually to the others the priests of this faith. They are, of course very ancient, being known all over the East and West, and as prominently in ancient Ireland as Iran; they are twice named in the Zenda Vesta as Maga or Magava, and in very ancient cuniform inscriptiom on rocks as Magush, from which the Greeks are held to have got their term Magos.2 The cuniform inscriptions, however, of Armenia, Azerbijan, Elymais, and Baga-stan (Behistoon) tell us that Ormazd was the god of the Aryans as well as the Medes, which makes some authors consider that the latter were Turanians, as no doubt were the early races of Media and Parthia. The Median language, M. Jules Oppert contends, was Turanian, and this he endeavours to prove from the names of the kings of Media given by Herodotus, Ctesias, and the arrow-headed inscriptions. Herodotus, he thinks, has given us the real names, whilst Ctesias has translated the meaning of them into Persian. The Medes early and closely allied themselves with these very independent Swiss-like mountaineers—the Armenians, a people of three tribes or kingdoms who always united in the presence of a common foe, and as such persistently and successfully maintained their indepen-dence against all the powers of Asyria from the ninth century B.C., and united in bring-ing about the dcstruction of that Shemitic empire in the seventh century. ARMENIA.—The Armenians consisted of the NAIRI, URARDA (Oor-ar-di, Al-ar-od-ii, or people of Ararat), and the MINI, all of whom seem to have been known to the Egyp-tians of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. The Nairi ruled over both banks of the Tigris from the mountains west of Lake Van, to Bir on the Euphrates; the Urarda—the strongest people—ruled north and east of the Nairi, on the Upper Euphrates, and probably on the Araxes; the Mini ruled the country south-east of the Urarda, and part of the Zagros;4 their capital was Van. Rawlinson calls these races “Turanians, or at any rate non-Aryan races,” apparently from “their close connection with the Phrygians,” and says that only under Persia do we hear them called Armenians of Armenioi, which seems to show that they had become Aryanized, but also that we must not draw these lines of philological demarcation too close, especially during the age we are here considering, nor extend them over all times. The great God and Goddess of Armenia were HALDI or AL-DI, and Bagmasti, whom Sargon carried off with a vast treasure found in the shrine, in 714 B.C. So great was the grief of the Armenian king of Ala-lat—Ursa—at the sacrilege, that he at once ran himself through the body with his sword.4 The temple was on an Akro-polis in the 1 Gospel of Infancy, III. 1. 2 Anc. Mons., III. 127, note. 3 Ibid, p. 123. 4 Sixth Mon., p. 126. 5 George Smith’s Assyria, p. 102. Soc. Prom. Christ. Knowl. "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 125midst of the town of Muzazir, but on a high conical and steep hill as befitted the god’s character. All Ala-lat or Ararat had long bowed before Al-di, which of course only signifies “the Most High God,” that is Maha-Deva. The goddess, we observe, is the “Bag,” bag or womb, and perhaps we may say the Bagh or “Garden of Delight.” We see a similar name to the South—Bag-istān, but Bag-ma-sti is even more express-ively “the place of the womb” or Mother Bag, whom India calls Bag-Vanu. It is possible that the Sti is merely the feminine affix, like Di or Vi in Eastern tongues. In Hebrew, Du-d is “a Basket” and “Beloved,” and in ancient Cornish Du is “a God,”1 but also a “Day,” showing us that it is female as in Diana, a goddess very much worshipped, says Diodorus, in these parts. Persians are even said to be called after her as Persea,2 and Orpheus calls her “Prothyrœa—the gate-keeper of life.” In his poem to his mythic son Musæus, he says:— “ Persian, unconquerable huntress, hail! The world’s key-bearer, never doomed to fail.” Doors, keys, and hunters or huntresses who never fail, have all one signification in this cult. But we are digressing. Most authors err in trying to define too exactly the relative positions of early Magianism and Zoroastrianism, all of which are growths of my first great streams, and must ever remain conjoined, as I show in coloured bands down to very pure days, nor entirely separated even in the Parsi religion of to-day. In the period now under consideration, we cannot eben eliminate from Magianism the Skuthic divining rods. By means of Barsom or willow wands these priests blessed or cursed, prophesied, and performed all manner of miracles, of which we have still a very mild remnant in the Cornish hazel wand,3 and in many parts of Asia. In ancient days Medes vied with Egyptians, and Jews imitated all, in the rods of Moses and Aaron as well as in the times of Hosea and Ezekiel, who, in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., say that their tribe “ask counsel at their stocks, and that their staffs declare it unto them.” Even though the statement of Westergaard be established, that the Magi in the time of Darius were not the priests of Ormazd, and that “Zoroastrianism early underwent some modification owing to Magian influence,”—this does not affect my argument, that there were two phases of Aryan Sun and Fire faith, which powerfully manifested themselves among the first semi-civilized peoples of whom history speaks, both betokening the rising to a higher faith than mankind had yet reached. MEDIAN WRITING.—This was cuniform, and like that of all Aryans, read from left to right, and this form the Persians adopted, but Mr. Rawlinson is of opinion that neither of these empires possessed a cursive or free form of writing even in the days of Darius. They usually wrote on parchment, and stamped important public decrees on rocks. The Zend is generally held to be an earlier and Bactrian dialect of the same language 1 Dumus is “bush or grove” in Latin, and Dux a “leader;” in Welsh Duw is “God,” Dwv “a bird,” and Du black, which show us that the black God—Krishna, or dark Venus, was meant. 2 See regarding this epithet, Gyrald.

Trans., April 1876."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 126as that of the Medes of Armenia, the latter being called the Medo-Persee, or Akaimenian, and the other the Sogdo-Bactrian. But these some consider as two stages of one language, or very close intermixing of Turanian and Shemitic tongues, for when the Medes first entered Armenia, if they brought with them a language of their own (Aryan Keltic?) they would, thinks Rawlinson, come upon a Turanian written dialect, and when they crossed the Zagros, they would meet with the cuniform Shemitic Asyrian, then also an old and well formed language.1 Nevertheless they could not have changed much, for this would put them beyond the reach of the ancient Zend faith, and leave them without a written tongue up to the seventh century B.C., which it is absurd to suppose of any of the old empires. So far as we yet know, none of these peoples had any permanently recorded faith prior to this, though using more or less written rituals, they prayed to and praised all the powers of nature, in sacred hymns and liturgies, and depicted her fertile energies in all the expressive forms of animnl life, this more especially for the culture of those who could neither read nor follow readers and reciters. The Book Revelation or writings then about to burst on Western Asia must as yet have been known only to pious denizens of the Caucasian, Hyrkanian, or high Baktrian Alps, who there spent their lone lives as Boodhist-like ascetics still do, conning these over and over, writing and re-writing, altering and amending in solitary dens and caves, apart from the busy world which was now, however, to fight for every word of these, as if direct gifts from heaven to a lost world. Till the written system of Zoroastrianism dawned, the faith of all the West was clearly that of the primitive races—those ancient Aithiopians or Kooths, Kuklopes, Kissians, or Soosanians, &c., who ruled all the valleys of the old world rivers, till She-mites drove them from these to the north, east, and west.2 These Koothites were the real founders of art and civilization—the traditional Memnonites who built that palace to Memnon between the two arms of the Kosapes, and who even in the thirteenth century B.C. were able to send a force to the assistance of Troy, the then western capital of the race. All Syria, the land of the Philistini, or, as Herodotus calls the great Aryan or Turanian peoples there, the Palaistini,3 was usually ruled by Egypt, and was so from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century B.C., says Rawlinson; though probably if we knew all the facts, it might turn out that the Palaistini were but the Phenicians who ruled over all the coasts of Asia Minor, and had also given rulers to the Delta of the Nile; anyhow, there was then, in all these western regions, an element of Aryan and Turanian social and political advancement, antagonistic to that Shemitic ascendancy which, welling up from its cradle lands in Arabia, had then seized and was now to hold the central Western States till the advent of the Zoroastrian Aryans. It was long before the fifteenth century B.C. that Sanskrit Aryans were Vedantists 1 Anc. Mons., III. 151. 2 See on this subject generally Anc. Mons, III. 241, &c. 3 Palestine, says Rawlinson, is etymologically the country of the Philestines. "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 127and had descended on India, and the sister faith and language (Vedanto-Zend?) must have been therefore maturing in or about Baktria centuries before this. Perhaps it re-mained as the conservative parent ever and again throwing off various shoots, now Vedantists then Boodhists, Pythagoreans, Essenes, and other ascetics, till the seventh century B.C., when it began itself bodily to forsake its northern central homes. This is perhaps the general belief of scholars, though I cannot say it is mine, as I see no reason why Zoroastrianism should not have been born where it grew into so goodly a tree. All the elements were there; Sun, Fire, ceremonials, rituals of all kinds, and great hierachies, from the mysterious, solemn. and long-robed Babylonian of the Delta (p. 77, Fig. 207-IX), to the gorgeous and pompous Magian of Media, and the little imitators of these, the Levitical officials on the Syrian hills. The philosophies which preceded Boodhism and awakened the East in the religious Sakya Mooni, and the West in men like Pythagoras and Thales, had then too dawned, and many leading ones were already acting on the religious minds around them, causing these to worship God, or such ideas of a great Creator, personal or abstract, as each could realise. XALMOXIS.—We read of a Skythian hermit, ZAL-MOXIS, who had much in common with, but lacked the genius and that restless. energy of a Confucius, Boodha and Christ, yet he lived widely known and cared for, in the solitudes of Mount Kaszon, by its forest stream on the borders of Transylvania and Moldavia. He was the Boodha of the Keltic tribes of the Ister, and, say Herodotus and Strabo, preached the eternal existence of the soul and forbade the taking of any life. He had renounced the world and the things of time, or in Thracian language had taken “the skin of the bear,” and lived, like it, in a dismal cave and a “howling wilderness.” By many he was called “a god,” but others said he was the prophet Gebel-eizes or the Incarnation of deity sent to save the lost world of the Getæ. Herodotus places his time long before Pythagoras, but others said he had been his disciple. If we knew more of the history of these times, we should probably find many such pious hermits “working out their own salvation” according to their lights, although the busy men of our days would say,wasting their time and opportunities, and shirking the duties and responsibilities which belong to us all; yet they, too, have filled no unimportant sphere in man’s civilization. Thus, then, the times were ripe for the ushering in of Zendic faith and philosophies, and no need for miracles or an Incarnation to make such acceptable; truly there was everywhere room for improvement. The nations had hitherto only bowed down and revered the Gods or Energies of Fertility, or “the Reproductive Principle,” which some able men had now wisely begun to term fœdissimum omnium institutum, and to denounce in such veiled language as they alone could presume to use and live. They hinted that both the principles and practice of all the faiths of earth were infamous and horrible; that it was both cruel and unnecessary to dedicate children to death, and wives and daughters to prostitution1 at the fanes of the sexual gods, yet the masses heard them not; the: best ladies of the land continued for long ages after this to observe all the 1 “Ne virgines prostarent.” See Pent. by a Physician, Part III., Scott’s series."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 128horrid rites, nor were men behind hand in the still viler practices of the Kadeschim—nowhere more rigidly adhered to than amidst Syrians in their so-called “Holy Land.” Solomon and his successors, with their serpent poles, groves; and phallic shafts were worthily represented in the north by the bull calves of Samaria; whilst Gaza, Askalon, Arabia Petrea, and Moab vied with Pharsalia, Samothracia, Lydia, and numerous Laris-sas from the Etruskan coasts to those of India, where Kātiwar boasted of its “Larice.” Romulus, too, proud of his new land, was at this time fixing his Palatium or Pallis on the Palatine, which the Rev. Mr. Smiddy assures us is a correct old Keltic word, from Fal, a “king,” and lios, a “house,” which makes this king Pallis, a Beth-El or Maha Deva;1 but we must pas on, saying here a few words as to the short-lived Babylonian kingdom of fourscore and eight years. BABYLONIAN CHARACTER.—This people of the sixth century B.C. must have been a rather intimate mixture of Aithiopians, Kaldians, Boorboors, Koothites, Aryans, and Shemites; of Arabs from the south and north-west, and of all the various tribes of Syria and other sea coasts. The people “were according to their lights a religious people,”2 rearing vast palaces and temples to their gods, and sparing no labour or cost in adorning these. “The monarchs were devout worshippers,” and gave great personal attention to every feature of their faith. They called the.ir children after their Gods, or gave them names expressing great depth of faith and religious feeling. Even the turbulent slaves of the nation confessed that at all their fetes and feasts their masters ever began by asking fervently for the blessings of the Gods, and with a rehearsal of their greatness and goodness. They were also, as a people, conspicuous for calmness, forethought, as well as honesty and truthfulness in their dealings. Though two thousand years, and in times of little writing, had elapsed since his-tory shows us Ur and Erek as great cities of an Aithiopian and possibly Turano-Kaldian kingdom, yet this new Babylonian empire of Nebukadnezar still held the same faiths. “The same gods were worshipped in the same temples and with the same rites, the same cosmogony was believed and taught, the same symbols were objects. of religious regard, even the very dress of the priests remained unaltered, and could Urnkh or Cheder-laomer have risen from the grave, and revisited the shrines wherein they sacrificed fourteen centuries earlier, they would have found but little to distinguish the ceremonies of their own day from those in vogue under the successors of Nabopolasar.”3 I need not therefore spend more time over the Babylonian religion of the fifth and sixth centuries B.C., having so fully described that of earlier days, but would caution reader of all historion of so-called Pagan nations, against the absurd idea that there was no advancement or progress during all those days. Advancement was not so rapid as in times when books freely circulate, for in the absence of books 1 Palas, he says,”is an inflection or corruption of Pallis or Fal-lis,” but I suspect Fal-leac or ”Stone Fal” and not Beth-El. The real meaning —the Lingam God—is the same. The Druids, &c., of Ireland, p. 64. Kelly, Dub., 1873. 2 Anc. Mons., III. 334. 3 Ibid., III., 458.

Nevertheless there is progress which our prejudices and ignorance often prevent our seeing, or if seen, appreciating. Babylonians aud Asyrians, as well as Jews, made great advances during all this long period. Theism as well as a spirituality of mind sprang up, which we cannot distinguish in the earlier days. Babylonian Jews speak in the days of Nebukadnezar of an Almighty and Omniscient God whose works are truth,1 and the Rev. Mr Rawlinson concedes that the reigning monarch was a pious man in his way, although he evidently thinks he ate grass. Yet he and all the wise or educated amongst his people “blessed the Most High (the Sun?), and praised and honoured Him who liveth for ever and ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion . . . who doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and amongst the inhabitants of the earth.”2 They clearly knew this “All Father Jah,” and recognised that all the gods of earth, and the images of them, were but representations to the uneducated of the “several phases of the Divine nature . . . the various names and titles of the Supreme designating his different attri- butes or the different spheres of his operations.”3 BABYLONIAN ECCLESIASTICS.—This people had also special seats of learning corresponding to our early universities, of which the most famous were Erek and Bor-sipa. The students were both diligent and talented, and not content merely to hand down the wisdom of their ancestors; their studies embraced “Astronomy, Astrology, History, Chronology, Grammar, Law and Natural Science.” The priesthood was a learned and powerful class, mostly hereditary, of high social as well as political status, and having ready access to their monarchs. With their wives and families they lived in sacred buildings adjoining the temples; they were scrupulously clean in their persons and dignified in their demeanour; and acted on very stringent laws as well re-garding their public sacrifices, altars, penances, and offerings, as their purificatory rites. They regarded private cleanliness as exhibiting spiritual purity, and they might not touch any impure, loathsome, or dead thing; nay, they had to purify themselves even after sexual contact, as if God had made vile the holy tie which they had themselves sealed and proclaimed as of His binding. Yet, putting aside some such foolish and ob-structive, if not unjust laws and rites; which no doubt the Jews borrowed—for nearly all their so-called Mosaic legislation is found here, the Babylonian priest- hood were a wise, useful, and learned body,4 who aided probably as much as any other clerical bodies have done, towards the progress and conservation of the good of their time. Like all priests, they insisted on the necessity of their intervention between God and man; and used to lead the worshippers before the symbols of deity and intercede for them with uplifted hands, just as the Raman Catholic priest still places himself before the altar and face the symbols of his faith. 1 Daniel iv. 33 to end. 2 This is common Akadian language, see Trans.

Culture and learning, even such as attained its zenith in Babylonia in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., existed in India long ages before that, for her civilisation, religious learning and art had then been long famed over all the east, and she had very old monarchies with vast armies, fortresses, and an immense population which the poorly populated valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris, and wild mountains of Iran or Media, could not compnre with. This was well known also here, for there was full shipping intercourse betwixt the ports of the Erythrean seas, and the mouths of the Narbada, for far more than “the gold of Ophir, peacocks and spices,” and there were also land-routes well known to all. It is yet to be proved that. the alphabet and culture which Babylon elaborated, and in a sense excogitated, and the instruments or ingenious devices she invented for astronomical and other purposes, had not their roots in India or from Indian sources; for Turanians, if not some Aryans, were an old people occupying all Mesopotamia, and apparently southern India, one or two thousand years before the Shemitic ascendancy in Babylonia of the 16th century, and it was clearly the drivmg out of these race which spread abroad a bright wave of progress over all the west; while it was the surging back again about 500 B.C. of this wave, which swept away the less progressive Shemites who had fulfilled their role, at least for a time; for proliflc Arabia—who had sent them up from her great desert breeding-grounds—had yet again and again a magnificent part to play in the culture and progress of the human race. I will now close this long chapter with a short sketch of the rise and fall, faith and culture of the Parthian Empire, necessary in order that we may see how the various peoples of Western Asia came under the influence of Christianity. We have seen them pass through the varied stages of Phallic and Serpent worship up to Magian, Fire, and Sun faith, and then to the far loftier and spiritual ideas of Zoroastrianism; after it came the Greek Indifferentism of the Seleukidæ, which towards the middle of the third cen-tury B.C. had to yield all the heart of Westem Asia to other and very different rulers, the Arsakidæ of Parthia, though in the matter of faiths, they too were equally indifferent with the Greeks.

Pattilla was “not merely the sole rival which dared to stand up against Rome in the interval between B.C. 65 and 226 A.D., but was a rival falling in many respects very little below the great power whose glories have thrown them so much into the shade.”1 Parthia granted greater liberty to her own subjects and foreigners than Rome did, and was equally wise and energetic in the management of her lands, trade, and manufactures. The foreign correspondence of the empire was well and strictly conducted in Greek; but Kaldi or Syro-Kaldi, such as Jews adopted after forget-ting their original Kutho-Phenician tongue, was apparently the most common written language of the Parthians. All the official matters of the state were in writ-ing, the revenue and other officers recieved all their orders in writing, and kept registers of all matters which came before them, whether of goods crossing frontiers, or strangers and citizens passing to and fro. In early times this was recorded on linen, but Pliny says that before his time they chiefly used papyrus, manufactured around Babylon. From Europe the people imported manufactures principally of metal, and exported textile fabrics of cotton, linen, and silk; their national banners were made of silk in the earliest period of their ascendancy.2 The people were very tolerant of all religions, scrupulous observers of thier word if once pledged; they looked upon the office of an ambassador as inviolable. They permitted all men to keep as many wives as they could afford, though she of the husband’s lineage was the head of the family; they do not appear to have given way to eunuch influence, but kept their women shut up and veiled in public. They were fond of conviviality, which they carried to some excess with music and dancing, but were always ready for the fray, and eagerly answered their monarch’s behest when told to arm and follow him. Every chief was answerable for his own contingent, which varied from one hundred and fifty to ten thousand men, mostly mounted on the small active horse of Persia. The sovereign was treated with divine honours, and worshipped after death as “Brother of the Sun Sun and Moon,” and tributaries were shocked if he condescended, in misfortune, to ask for aid. He personally decreed justice on important suits in a hall resplendent with solar imagery, and from whose vaulted and star-bespangled roof hung four golden wheels called “the tongues of the gods,” and which, doubtless, represented the four seasons, as did the monarch on his golden throne, the Sun. During the dominion of the Akaimenians, Parthia accepted the Zoroastrian faith with its Ormazd, Ahriman, and Magianism, but when left to themselves, returned to Phallo-Tsabeanism, and the domestic worship of the Lares and Penates, or as Josephus calls these, “¢fridÚmata tîn qeîn and sebasmata,” and their worship “qerapeia or qrhskeia,”3 i.e., they worshipped “emblems of God,” yes, of Theos, the god whom Jews and 1 Rawlinson’s Sixth Monarchy, p. 427. 2 Pliny, Hist.

Josephus says the Parthians carried them about (as his forefathers had done), and that the service offered to them was a real and true “worship.”1 All revered these domestic gods or Lares and Penates, and had a niche in their houses for them as Latins had. The monarch had special tutelary genii, whom he invoked and often swore by, like the Bagâha Vithiyâ of the Persians.2 In the early days of the nation, Magianism and “Elemental Worship” were principally in vogue; Fire was held sacred; and no one was permitted to pollute either earth or rivers with dead bodies, so these were exposed to be devoured sometimes by wild beasts, but generally by birds, as Parsis still direct; the bones being carefully collected, were solemnly depo8sited in tombs or cases. When the Magi fell into disrepute, cremation became common, but Fire-altars were still rigorously maintained. The Parthian rulers, however, put no religious restraints upon anyone, and hence Jews and Chritians had their converts, whom we observe they gloried in, just as proselytizers do at the present day. Various Greek communities flourished, worshipping all the Olympian Pantheon. In spite, however, of all this, and the boast, though I fear devoid of much foandation, made by Eusebius, that Parthians had a large Christian body and a gospel among them iu the first century, and listened to the ruling of an Edessan Church Council in 198, the Reverend historian of the Ancient Monarchies confesses, that neither “the manners nor customs” of the people were in any way affected thereby.3 Let us lightly skim through the political history of the kingdom and empire, for nations, like individuals, get or adopt their faiths very much from their circumstances. PARTHIAN NAME, &c.—The balance of evidence, it is said, favours the Turanian origin of the original Parthian race. They are thought to have been a remnant of the old Turan tribe, who, it is customary, and I think with reason, to say once dominated over all the country from the Oxus to the Danube. About the time of the Macedonian conquest, these Turanians seem to have been scattered about in small communities, with a good deal of pure blood, in the highlands of Parthia proper; but their kinsmen are said to have been Etruskans, Huns, Bulgarians, Komans, the Galatians of Christian times, Basques, Usbegs, Kalmaks, Ouigurs, Eleuts, &c. Most ancient Kaldia was assuredly first peopled by such a stock, whose names bore close affinity to favourite Parthian compounds of Ak and Ak-es-geses; they often incorporated the Turanian name for god, Annap or Ana-ap, or Ana-Op, with other Parthian-like words. The holy books of Zoroas-trianism do not class Parthians with their Aryan children. Although they name every race around the Parthian mountain-home, they only notice it as Nisaya or Nisea, said to mean “a wild, unpeopled, rugged space.”4 The name is of great interest. The Greeks called Parth and Parthi, Parthuéne and Parthuaio, but they never met 1 Gen. xxxi, 19, 30-35.

The race being essentially mountaineers, the people on the plains would naturally call them P’hāiris or Pha’hāries, from Pahār, the commonest term all over the east for a mountain; but the race themselves always “affect in their names the termination Ak,” as in Ars-ak-es, Sin-ak-es, Par-ak-es (absurdly spelt Parrhace, &c.), P’ra-at-ak.es, &c., and as Canon Rawlinson shows, these words have a Turanian appearance, remind-ing us of “the Turanian root annap, ‘god,’ perhaps traceable in Amm-inap-es.”2 Ak is generally a more active form of Sol than Ar, so in Greek we have Ak-on, “a dart,” Ak-e, “a point or edge;” in Latin, Ac-us, “a needle,” and Ac-uo, “I sharpen,” which, in the Hebrew, is applied to the mind, as Ak, “comprehension.” The more ancient tongues, however, go back to the root idea, for in old Irish Ac is a “son” (Gaelic, M-ac); Ac-ar, “sharp;” Ach’t, “a nail which catches or penetrates;” Ach-a, “a mound;” Ach-adh, “a sacred enclosure.” In. Welsh we have much the same, only aspirated, Hac being “a cut or hack,” and Hacho “penetrating.” No derivation of Parthia, Persis, etc., is satistory which puts aside a people’s faith; and seeing this was here represented by Sun, Fire, aud Phallic emblems, we must look for light to Ur, which is the same as Ar, and to P, the male or active form, and their interahangeable letters, as B, V, F, e, a, or oo, and l for r; al1 these with or without aspirates. This yields P’ur (not from the Greek for Fire, but its source, the oldest Kaldi, and Pur = Par = Pal = P’Al = P’El = Bel = Bal = Ba-Al = Bol = Bull; and with P and oo, the common Parthian words P’ool = P’vool, as in Vool-o-gesis, a common and kingly name amongst Parthians and very characteristic of “the primitive Baby-lonian, the Basque, and most Turanian tongues.”3 Let us look at the various names for Fire, which indeed I should have mentioned in chapter IV., for we require to con-stantly bear such in mind in prosecuting our researches, aud we must not limit our vision to one lingual class or family, and remember that Fire and Sun are often syno-nymous.

The term Tine, Teine, etc., now common among Kelts, is clealy one of these corruptions which very often occur in Faiths, viz., making the abode, ark, or circle of the god into a deity, and actually giving to it the god’s name; as we notice in the case of the Jewish ark, which, though only a box in which to keep the Eduth, came to be actually worshipped as a representation of Jahveh himself. To this hour its memory is revered as the most sacred matter of Jewish faith, for it was a perfect symbol of Jahveh, whether with or without the Eduth! So the sacred circle or well—the Ain—in which the Kelt worshipped or saw his great deity Ta, To, Tor, or Tot, would naturally become the Ta-ain, or Tinne, just as Ta-Or is Tor—his Apollo, and I-OR or I-ON, his ancient “Pillar-god,” reminding us of the IER or HIER after whom the holy cave and rock of Jerusalem were first named. We may change the H here to F; this being permissible and common. Thus the old Spanish word Fijo, formerly so written and pronounced, is in modern Spanish Hijo with a silent h1 at least among the culti-vated. Many similar examples might be given, especially amongst Basque, base Latin, or Romance dialects. The words fathse and faisse, so late aa the thirteenth cen- tury A.C. used to be written haitze; and ferriague, harriague. But ancient people even added and omitted important initial consonants like M, C, and K, as well as H, before Or or Orus, writing this deity’s name indifferently, Cor, Chorus, Korus, Horus or Orus, of which some learned writers just quoted give prominent cases, as in Orfacao, a place on the Arabian coast betwixt Sohar aud Masadam, which Barretto makes Cor-facan, and we Khor-fakan. So Ormara, on the opposite coast of Makran, is also Kormara,2 and as r = l the name is indifferently pronounced and written Or-Malan and Khor-Malan; so that Hier, or the god IER, may be FIER, our Fire, and also I-EL, or the Pillar El-God, before whom it was necessary for all pious Jews to worship or vow, and therefore to go to I-EL-oo-Salim to do so. Hebrews, like Persians, commonly prefer harsh to liquid sounds, and have here hardened the L into R; but Hielopolis was no doubt as correct as Hieropolis, and El-Opolis possib1y more so than either. To derive the name of the old Jebusite sacred rock and cave from the Greek Hieros, “sacred,” is too palpably making the wish father of the thought; for Greeks only got an alphahet of twenty-four letters in 400 B.C., and had no influence whatever then in the Syrian Highlnnds. In the cuni-form, Jerusalem, \\ylcry, (I, r, oo, s, l, i, m) would read Ur-salima,3 “the happy abode of Ur,” which may be the Moon as well as Fire and Light, and very probably the former, as “The Grove” or Yoni. This indeed seems the meaning of Ps. lxxii. 7, where the city or its ruler is evidently alluded to, as that which is to give to the righteous “abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth”—i.e., so long as the Moon or 1 Lon.

The letters I, R, U, or Iro, occur in many Syrian names, as in the old capital of I r h u, which we miscall Jericho. It is often written Yaho or Yahoo, why, the ancient name for the Canaanite god which Jews aspirated, adding h, h or he. The root signification may lie in the Keltic Ar-ar, “adoration,” or Heb. ary, or hary (Yare, or irah) , “fearing” or “reverencing.” The Jah or Yah hy is replac-able by la, El or Al, and often is. Of course every place where Ier or El resided was sacred, and in all such places, ancient Kelts offered Iad-ad or adoration.1 But this I-er is the great God Ur of the Akadians and favourite name for a city, varied, says the Rev. Mr Sayce, to Eri, Uru, and by the Shemites, when they made headway in the 16th C.B.C. to ryo Oir, Eir, etc., and by Asyrians to Alu for Uru.2 Cities are, of course, called after their oldest and greatest god, and so we see that in Akadia, as in Jerusalem, there was an Ier-polis. Ier, Er, Eri, El, or Al, were most natural names for early Ethio-pians to give to a holy rock, cave, and font, and they ruled all this land, says Mr. Sayce, quoting Pliny and others, from before the deluge, of which more hereafter; for we must return to the Parthians, who also, I think, got their name from their chief deities, just as did the Perses or Persians and the Pharisee worshippers on this rock of Moriah, or Iave Ire of Gen. xxii. 14. The Asyrians do not seem to have known of Parthians as a nation or specific people, and as all then worshipped fire, this would not distinguish them if a mere reli-gious sect. The Jewish records say nothing regarding them, but we read of them on the rocks of Bag-istān, and the sculptures of Nakshi-Roostam; they are stated to have re-volted in the troubles following the death of the Pseudo-Smerdis, 521 B.C., as they had done, says Diodorus, under Median rule in the days of Kuaxares, 620 B.C.; this last statement being from Ctesias. Mr George Rawlinson rejects it. Their first contact with the West was said to be when they furnished a contingent for the great army of Xerxes in 480 B.C. The most trustworthy old writers call the Parthians Skuths, not by descent or blood, but meaning by this a people who led an unsettled and wild nomadic life; and this the Parthians did. Even when, as monarchs, they ruled in Babylon, they con-stantly went out and lived in great camps on the plains, and individually they were said to eat and sleep on horseback. The nation grew from small and apparently accidental causes. The Seleukid ruler who left the ruins of great Babylon with their pestilential surroundings and depressing appearances, tried to live in his own eponyme capital of Seleukia, opposite Ktesiphon on the Tigris, but felt this also ungenial to his Grecian upbringing, and— o fatal mistake!—which, as the rulers of India, we do well to bear in mind, when Simla and its pleasant mountain breezes entice us away from the sweltering cities of the plains and their teeming multitudes,—he went to fair Antioch on the Orontes, and allowed Dahe, Korasmia, and Baktria. to please themselves, provided they sent him a moderate tribute. From the court of the upstart Grecian Satrap, Diodotus, there went forth to these intrepid highlanders of Parthia, one Asākes, a Baktrian—a man of some 1 See Rev. R. Smiddy’s Druids, &c., p. 248. 2 Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch., I. ii., p. 294, et seq."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 136effrontery, but no particular amount of brain-power or courage. He had been, it is said, offended with Diodotus, but it seems more probable that he saw a path for ambition in the supineness of the distant Seleukid, and a good ensample in the position of his own ruler, Diodotus—himself an adventurer. The great monarch seemed indifferent, content if but left to gaze in peace from the cool heights of the Orontes towards his distant Grecian home. This Arsakes soon rose, and ruthlessly slaughtered all who had helped him to power, and established in the secluded valley of Hekatompulos—the famous capital of these mountaineers, a sovereignty and dynasty which, from 250 B.C. to 226 A.C. ruled one of the richest, fairest, and most ancient habitats of our race. Some say Arsakes was a Skuthian, who at the head of a body of Dahi horse established himself on the Okus—the valley separating northern Parthia from Korasmia, when Baktria declared independence, under the Satrap Diodotus, and this seems probable, seeing how closely and long these erratic and independent hill men clung to the dynasty, for etymologically Dahi and Parthi are likely to be connected; but we may never know the truth, and it is of little consequence. Arsakes I., as he is called, had but a short and troubled life, which terminated on a battlefield, in 247 B.C., when his brother, the real Arsakes—Tiridates, became the first king, under the title of Arsakes II. He rose at the same season as Ptolemy Euergetes of Egypt, nor neglected his opportunity. The distant Emperor, Seleukus II. (Kalinikus), was in 245 B.C. swept from his throne, and his eastern empire traversed from Antioch to Soosana by the energetic young Egyptian monarch. Fortunately art and literature were of more value in Ptolemy’s eyes than Parthian lands, so he returned to his own land, content with all the art treasures he could discover, and Tiridates annexed Hyrkania. This was not, however, to be long borne, so Antiokus Kalinikus gathered together a sufficient force, and marched upon Parthia, in 237 B.C., but acknowledged Baktria as an ally. Tiridates had to fly to the Skuthic camps between the Oxus and Jaxartes, but only for a very short space, for he of Baktria died, and Arsakes II., returning with northem aid, met the great monarch in fair battle, and defeated him, and secured the foundation of Parthian independence and monarchy. In 214 B.C. his son Artabanus captured Ekbatana, and the heart of all Babylonia, but this again called forth the western monarch—this time Antiokus III., who has been surnamed “the great.” He advanced in the face of immense difficulties, and not only reached the Parthian capital in the defiles of the great Elbruz chain, but ascended the Hyrkanian range, fighting his way up close and rugged defiles to probably 5000 or 6000 feet, and winning a battle on the summit, but all this and more without effect, for he had to concede Parthian independence, and in return ask aid to reconquer Baktria. This, too, ended similarly. Antiokus left in 206 B.C., and Cis-Caspian territory was never more to be ruled by other than true Asiatics. Once more indeed was it attempted to recover the Asiatic empire. In the spring of 129 B.C., Antiokus Sidetes set out with an army of over 300,000 men,. to win back, at least in part, the old Babylonian dominions, but"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Early Faiths of Western Asia. 137after warring all through that year, and very successfully, he and nearly all his army perished miserably in the following spring from a general uprising of the people, backed by the untiring energy of Phraates, King of Parthia, in the plains between Babylon and the Zagroo. No avenging force ever returned east, and the empire of the Seleukidi was lost for ever. Judea, long oppressed, revolted in the south, and Rome shortly after stepping in, the great Seleukid dynasty had to rest content with Cilicia and Syria proper, or the tract west of the Euphrates between Amanus and Palestine.1 Phraates I. did all he could to pacify the fallen dynasty; he sent the body of Anti-okus to Syria in a silver coffin, and allied the sinking house with that of the conquering Arsakes, but next year he himself perished in a sudden onslaught of Skuthians, com-bined with treachery on the part of some Greek mercenaries—the remnant of the Syrian army, whom, by kindly treatment, he thought he had won over. The cause of the Skuthian raid is said to have been the movement of a great central Asio-Turanian race, the Yue-ki, who were pushed forward by the Hiong-nu,2 whom some say are Huns. This forced onwards the Su, who lived along the river Ili. They descended on Baktria, and the Yueki on Parthia; the occurrence confirms the statement as to six hundred years being the tidal periods of Skuthic overflows, fur the last occurred, as we have seen, in. 630, and caused the destruction of the Asyrian empire. It was these Saki who settled on the lands about the Helmend lake, and gave to them the name of Sakasteni, now modi-fied to Seistān; a considerable portion of the Indus Valley, is designuted after them Indo-Skuthia. Northern India is held to have partly ejected this people in 56 B.C., but the Jāts or Jits are supposed to be of this stock, or of the Massa-geti or “great Jits.”3 It is not necessary for the purposes of this work that I should here continue Parthian history, my object being merely to trace the rise of great nations, so far as these destroy, tolerate, nurse, or develop faiths. Parthia continued a powerful, and on the whole, a suc-cessful rival of Rome up to her decline, which arose from internal divisions, weakened no doubt by luxury and partial effeminacy, but also by several inroads, for which although she extracted the severest retribution on her invaders, yet striking as they did at the seat of her empire—Ktesiphon and Seleukia—they weakened her fatally in the eyes of a hete-rogeneous population consisting of groups of kingdoms. The last Roman invasion was headed by the cruel tyrant Caracalus, who, after sacking Babylonia on his return home by Arbela—that “sacred city of the dead,” where the Maha-Deva of the Shemitic world, great Seth or Set, is said to have been buried—excited the bitter wrath of the whole land by insulting and demolishing all the tombs he could find. This at last completely aroused and called forth the long-suffering but brave old monarch, Artabanus, who. assembling the whole forces of the declining monarchy, came upon the Roman army 1 Rawlinson’s Sixth Mon., p. 105.

Macrinus a pretorian prefect, who had assumed command, desired to treat, but Artabanus was too exacting and a battle commenced which lasted for three days, being the fiercest and best contested Rome and Parthia had ever fought. Rome was defeated and Macrinus fled, but Parthia was utterly exhausted, and Artabanus contented himself with one-and-a-half million sterling, and the restoration to Parthia of all the captives and booty Caracallus had carried off. All this availed not, however, to save the tottering state; its course had run, and its days of usefulness had passed by. Conspiracy had gone too far, and among too many classes, and great Parthian leaders were committed to a new regime or had cherished hopes which could not now be restrained. Affections once alienated can rarely be recovered, and hence revolutionary ideas go on, even after every just demand has been conceded, and though the time and necessity for reform seems to have passed. The lesson is a solemn one to the rulers of India, and so important, that I cannot refrain from here quoting what the wise historian of the Sixth Monarchy writes on this Parthian crisis.2 “It is impossible at the present day to form any trustworthy estimate of the real value of those grounds of complaint which the Persians, in common doubtless with other subject races, thought that they had against the Parthian rule. We can well understand that the supremacy of any dominant race is irksome to the aliens who have to submit to it; but such information as we possess, fails to show us either anything seriously oppressive in the general system of the Parthian government, or any special grievance whereof the Persians had to complain. The Parthians were tolerant; they did not interfere with the religious prejudices of their subjects, or attempt to enforce uniformity of creed or worship. Their military system did not press heavily on the subject peoples, nor is their any reason to believe that the scale of their taxation was excessive. . . . . . . If we endeavour to form a distinct notion of the grievances under which the Persians suffered, they seem to have amounted to no more than this:—1. That high office, whether civil or military, were for the most part confined to those of Parthian blood, and not thrown open to Parthian subjects generally. 2. That the priests of the Persian religion were not held in any special honour, but placed merely on a par with the religious ministers of the other sub- jects races. 3. That no advantage in any respect was allowed to the Persians over the rest of the con- quered peoples, notwithstanding that they had for so many years exercised supremacy over Western Asia, and given to the list of Asiatic worthies, such names as those of Cyrus and Darius Hystaspes. On the whole, however, the historian is unable to find any satisfactory cause, and thinks that success was the principal justification, and that Persians acted on “ The ancient rule, the good old plan, That those shall take who have the power, And those shall keep who can.” Nevertheless it is clear that it was Parthian tolerance which was most hateful to the intolerant and dogmatic Persian, and the first result of Persian success was to enforce a rigid uniformity in religion, the enthronement of the priestly Magi, and a persecution, even to blood and sequestration of all the property, of every person who declined obedience to the precepts and doctrines of Zoroastrianism. The first movement in this direction was 1 Julius Martialis: one of his guards murdered him on the 8th of April 217 A.C. 2 Op. Cit., p. 361.

In 226 A.C. he fought a pitched battle with the Parthian emperor and slew him, and in a year or so more, blotted out thc great Arsakid Empire, which had ruled western Asia and stemmed the continued assaults of Roman power, for nearly five centuries. Long before its fall the Arsakidi, as before said, had courted ruin by internecine quarrels which had fettered all trade; and put a stop to such little love of letters and arts as they had fostered in more prosperous times. Greek literature and even language which then ruled the civilised world, had actually been forgotten, and clearly the empire’s role had been played out. At no time had Parthians much to show in the way of art and architecture, but now they stopped all progress. The only ruin the race have to show us, is a strange half Serai (Inn) and half stable, within the once great city of Hatra or El-Hadhr, so called on account of its dedication to the Sun (El), for it had within its high and massive ramparts a wonderful temple to Sol. The walls were perfectly circular, of immense strength, faced with cut stone, and defended by a formidable ditch. Four gates pierced these, at the cardinal points, and all were defended by outworks of no mean strength, as Roman armies had good reason to know. The city lay in the centre of the Upper Doob or watershed, be-tween the Tigris and Euphrates, about sixty miles south-west of Ninus. Beyond its so-called palace and temple ruins I can learn of no Parthian buildings of much interest. We can, however, get at the faith of these people when we seek them in their mountain homes, and I give here the drawing of a very graphic sculpture discovered by Baron de Bode in 1841,2 which leaves us in no doubt as to the faith of Parthians, and I think also depicts to us the object of universal worship of all the races over which they ruled, from the sources of the Euphrates, Oxus, and the Indus, to at least so far as east longitude 74°. This important sculpture shows us that in Parthia proper, Lingam faith existed in full development down to three hundred years after Christ, and in those very cradle lands, where is devotees say it was first nursed and throve, 3000 to 5000 B.C. From thence, that is to say, from the mountaina of Baktria and 1 It may not be generally known that Art is an old Keltic term for “God” and “a Stone,” as the Art or Alt-Stone—that is the Altar Stone.The Druids of Ireland, by Rev.

Wherever fertility in animal or vegetable life was a thing sought for by men and women, there it co-existed with these natural aspirations, and to show my readers the universal dominance of the faith, I repeat here for comparison with the Magian Lingam, that of the Fijian one already given in Vol. 1. Millions of our fellow-subjects are now adoring these objects, from the latest annexation of Her Majesty in the Polynesian group, to our oldest possession in the Karna-tic. See what exact counterparts of each other these Magian and Fijian Lingams are, even to “the hangings,” which in Indian Sivaik parlance would be called serpent-streamers, but elsewhere the posthe or special seat of passion.1 The Reverend author of the Parthian Monarchy, though giving us the grossly adorned emblem, passes over its significance as denoting the faith of the people he is endeavouring to enlighten the public concern-ing, with the curt remark that it is a sculpture of a Magus “consecrating a sacred cippus, round which have been placed wreaths of chaplets!” There were groups of worshippers before this Magi and the Lingam, “fifteen arranged in two rows, one above the other all except the first of them standing . . . . and the conical cap described by Strabo is very conspicuous;”2 to which I add, of course, for they are worshipping the golden calf or cone, and it is ribbed and fluted as many such symbols are. This is the principal Parthian has-relief which seems to have been discovered. It was found “on an isolated mass of black rock near Teng-i-Saoulek in the Baktyari mountains.” If those who write history do not inform their readers of the dearest objects of a nation’s faith, because these objects are immodest, they grievously mislead the public and lay the foundations of a mass of false literature which misleads most readers and commentators; for these do not as a rule go to the root of matters, when they think that capable and otherwise faithful writers have already done so. All historians should know what is meant when a high priest is shown standing with Siva’s open hand before a Phallus on an altar, and if alluded to at all, the truth should be clearly stated. This sculpture is a matter of extreme importance, both intrinsically and as a key to other objects. It is clear that out of this “nature-worship” sprang Zoroastrianism and Magianism, and that neither of these purged out this element, till the Christian era was well advancecd, for Fig. 222 belonged to the Hatra period, which city flourished down to 300 A.C.3 and probably to 360 A.C. Moreover, the sculpture is of still greater moment, when we are told by the historian of Anc.

During the five centuries of their sway, they seem to have set up no more than some half-dozen bas-reliefs.1 He refers to this as one of those where “the costume and appearance of the great hierarchs under the Parthians” seem indicated with accuracy. As Mr. Rawlinson states, Josephus appears perfectly familiar with this Parthian and Babylonian worship, but he gives no countenance whatever to the Canon’s remark that they were “ancestral,” that is, connected with Ancestor-worship, or authority for the statement that “the main worship of the great mass of the people was concen-trated upon ancestral images.” This is akin to the erroneous idea that all “Lares and Penates” were images of ancestors. We see in numerous figures exactly what the Penates are, and in this gem of Mr. Layard’s what one phase of Lares-worship consists of.2 Josephus tells us these emblems were “the gods of the country,” not ancestors; he describes them as “images of the Gods, which it was the custom of that country for all to have and to worship in their own houses, and to carry along with them into a foreign land, agreebly to which custom of theirs” a Parthian wife who married a Jew, did precisely as Rachel did, viz., “carried her idols with her.”3 We see thus that from the days of Jacob and Rachel, aye, and long ages before even this mythic era, down far into Christian times, this faith and its customs never altered, and that the worhip of all the ancient monarchies of Western Asia, and indeed of Europe, was precisely the same as it is to this day thoughout India and over most of Asia. 1 Sixth Mon., p. 388. 2 [Since the design, while taken from a book on the archæology of Nineveh and Babylon, is Egyptian (the seated figure is generally identified as Harpocrates) and the carving—at least as reproduced by Forlong and Inman—bears no inscription, there is no clear reason, probably no reason at all, to connect it with the Roman cult of the Lares. — T.S.] 3 See pp. 131, 132, ante."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII.

It is acknowledged that mankind had in many places attained to a civilisation, and left traces of habits and faiths long before the earliest glimmerings of any real history. On all sides the learned have been crying out against the straitened vista of a few thousand years, within the narrow limits of which the orthodox Christianity of Europe has striven in vain to keep them. Archeologists and geologists have laboriously struggled to work under such restrictions, and many good writers are now discarding these ecclesiastical figments, at the certain risk however of some social ostracism. The learned and accimplished President of the Geographical Section of the British Association of 1875, said that “the earth’s past history extended over hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of years,”1 and in a purely scientific work of the same year we read: “the general conclusion to which we are therefore led from physical consider-ations . . . is that the entire geological history of our globe must be comprised within less than a hundred millions of years, and that consequently the commencement of the glacial epoch cannot date much further back than two hundred aud forty thousand years.”2 The author had been calculating astronomical movements extend-ing from several millions before our era to a million of years after it, and he here 1 Address of Lieut-General R.

Because we have learned something of the times when graving or writing became first known. in India, Kaldia and Egypt, why reject with scorn or doubt the stories of races who flourished there thousands of years before the times of cylinders, tablets and monumets? It is clear to all who have studied the now abundant literature regarding prehis-toric man, his ancient mounds and tumuli, kromlechs, towers and pillars, the Lats of Arabia and the east, and the Nurhags which the Romans gazed upon with as much wonder as we do, that great races have surged to and fro in mighty waves, as well as moved quietly in social intercourse with each other, over every part of the globe, from the frozen north to the sunny south, as we have described concerning Skyths, and their con-querors, Kuklopiams, Kelts, Kuthites, etc. Though steam and electricity were unknown to these migratory raees, yet they $eem to have made up in a measure for our now small but continual moves, by ever and again emigrating on a grand scale.

The ancients were no doubt as prolific, or even more so than peoples in these civilised times; for it seems a law of nature, that productiveness shall increase both as regards man and beast, in proportion to the dangers and vicissitudes to which each is subjected, yet, in very early days, constant wars, massacres, and exposure to all the seve-rities of nature seem, in spite of such a law, to have kept population far lower than now. In the map at the beginning of this chapter, Plate II., “The world as known about the Second Century B.C.” I show by lines some of the principal movements of peoples before and after the Christian era, and by red patches the best known remnants of these which we have as yet ascertained. In exhibiting the movements of Huns, Vandals, Alans, etc., who disturbed all Europe between the second and fifth Centuries A.C., and so paved the war for Christianity, or any othet faith which promised peace and greater security of life and property, we are necessarily perplexed by the erroneous configur-ation of land aud sea, for the map which is conformable generally to the histories of Arrian, Diodorus Siculus, and Strabo, etc., is not suitable for the third and fourth cen-turies of our era. Regarding these times, however, my readers will find abundant maps elsewhere. No student can study the moat ancient records of human movements without seeing that some grand cyclical cataclysm, or steady downward movement of cold, accompanied by the encroachment of the frozen polar seas, had been driving the ancestors of Turans, Aryans, etc., south and southwesterly; and our philosophers and astronomers are on the right track when they speak to us of the revolution of the poles, progression of the perihelion, the earth’s cycle of eccentricity of orbit, etc., caus-ing glacial eras, thus accounting for the abundant animal life, ferns, palms, and other tropical productions which we find buried beneath Siberian ice. The mountains and valleys of the Himalayas, the cliffs of Bamian, and the plains through which flow the Euphrates and the Nile, no less than those of the Shannon and Tiber, alike proclaim a robust and very ancient people, who are usually called Kyklops, Kooths, and then Kelts, Kymri, Phenicians, &c. The most cursory scientific traveller through Ireland and Sardinia (for these races loved islands and sea-coasts best) through the vales and landes of Basque and Bretany, the coasts of Italy, as well as high upon the pleasant slopes of her Apennines, must be struck with the vast ruins, strange and solitary or grouped monoliths, sculptures, and wonderful buildings of these ancient men; and will ask in vain whence they sprang. The learned will reply that the oldest Greeks asked the same question about thrce thousand yearn ago, and that only now light is dawning on the subject. Who, then, were these Kyklopian builders? So far, we see in them a race of valiant phallic worshippers, and in their monoliths, towers, and shrines, the same faith that reared similar ones on the heights and passes from the Oxus, through or by way of Kāferistān to India, as well as by “the City of the Cleft,” or “the City of Caves” (Basiman), into the plains of the Tigris and Euphrates. "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 145The remains of these buildings in Europe are classed differently by engineers; but I shall call them all “Kyklopian,” meaning by that, massive dry masonry, or stones put together without mortar. Let us try to grasp their style distinctly. 1st. KYKLOPIAN Proper. { These are large unhewn blocks rudely put together with smaller stonesto fill up the interstices.

Example.—Mycenæ, Etruria, Fiesole, and all Nurhags or phallic pillars and towers, like those of Etrurian and Sardinia. It must not be suppused that these styles denote different ages—they may, but governments and communities, each according to their means and fancies, still use them all, and in the same year. The builders were evidently the same, and so probably the time. They must also have been the rulers of the country, perhaps of so great an empire as that of Rome. At all events the sun never set on the regions of their faith, for it was the faith of the world; and although some Aryans proper were then possibly worship-ping in sacred circles and groves, yet these builders—Ta-Urians, followers of Toth and Ur the Sun and Moon represented, I believe, the dominant faith in most lands then, and for ages after them. When these Kyklopians, Koothites, and Pelasgi began to decrease, another phase of their faith arose in the semi-Turanian Keltic sun-worship-pers. These seem to have had as holy places and temples, stone circles, fire-altars, womb-like tumuli, and ophite mounds and avenues, for when Bretany, Britain and Ire-land, Malta, Sardinia, the Ionian and other islands and headlands were covered with towers and Nurhags, clearly no Kelts and solar circles couid have been there. No one can examine the towers and walls of the great building race without acknowledging that they were a powerful and ingenious people, who had arrived at an advanced stage in the fine arts, as well as in mechanics and mining. Their cities were huge and en-during beyond all that we now attempt; and many archeologists insist that these were probahly reared as long before the foundation of Athens as we are after it. When the Egyptian leaders Ammon, Toth or Osiris were probably teaching their people to dwell in cities, and rear in holy caves or crypts the symbol of life or genera-tion, these northern European sculptors may have been erecting the first massive citadel of Fiesole, on which the sight-seer at Florence gazes with wonder; and one cannot help contrasting the dwarfed and unsubstantial appeanmce of the Christian church and its tawdry, tinsel-draped sanctuary of the Mother “ever-Virgin,” here raised “over the mighty dead,” with the massive and severely unadorned ancient shrine which "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 146formerly stood there over the naked symbol of the All-Father creator, so well known in the East. Those who wish to see the masonry of these great builders should visit Samos, Kephalonia, Ithaka, Santa-Maura, Mycenē, aud numerous spurs of the Apen-nines, and searchers for round towers or Nurhags (see Plates VI., VII., X., and XII.) should go to Sardinia, where the ruthless hand of man has not yet effaced all these. Thirteen hundred Lāts, it is said, can be counted in one quarter of this island alone, and sometimes a dozen in a valley not six miles long. The towera have generally Men-hirs or monoliths with them, that is the Egyptian Ob-El, Obelisk, or “Serpent-Sun”— the three faiths harmonising, but no pure solar worship obtaining. Siva, Fire and fertile Sol, were perhapg beginning to be called one, but pnre Sabeanism was then no doubt a heresy. As a rule, we may grant that monoliths and monolithic structures are more ancient than built towers, for they predominate near non-building troglodytes whom these Kyklopians instructed, as well as the builders of Babel, Asher, Perse-polis, Tadmor, and all very ancient cities. As Jacob Bryant did seventy years ago, so have we still to search in dark mines, such as Doric and Sibylline prose or poetry, and the fragmentary writings of Sankuni-athon, and similar ancient and uncertain sources, for the early history of all these old peoples. Neither the stones of Egypt nor the baked tablets of Babylon and Asyria have as yet given us a tithe of the information we require: yet from many quarters, and notably from our own islands, we have gained matter confirmatory of many old writings, and thus aided, we must try and frame a kind of history of these ancient races. It seems probable that the earliest notice and nucleus of their history is before us in the account of “The Wars of the Gods and Titans,” or Giants—feebly echoed in the early chapters of the Jewish Genesis, when it is said the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and the Giants or Rephaim race interfered with the puny Sethites; then it was that a general stampede took phee from Babel, in order that the unity of the race of man might not become too strong for the puny El or Al—a God whom some called the Creator. This “dispersion” is supposed by English orthodoxy to have taken place in the middle of the 25th century B.C., but by the Jewish Septuagint and Josephus, about the 30th, or sooner, if we take into account the time there assigned to Abram—2605 B.C. As both India and Greece speak of such a great popular disturbance, we may con-sider that it actually took place; and it is therefore shown in my chart as one of those broad pale bands, marking a cyclic wave of human thought and motion. The Babylonian Koothites, it is said, fled to Tartarus, Ades or the West, and perhaps transferred the name of their parent stream—Teth-gris or Tigris—to the Tiber, the Tagus and the Tamesis or Thames. Their first great settlement in the north-west was in the valleys of the Tanais or Don—up to twelve hundred years ago, ever the home of Goths, Alans, Skyths, or Skuths. Ancient Irish records speak of a well-known Skuthic empire, “ruled over by Ni-On, the son of Pelus,” that is Pi-El-eus, or the phallic "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 147Sun-idea or faith. He was the “sovereign of the universe,”1 and the head of all those who owned the name of Kooth, Cus, Chus, Scoth, Scotia, Scoti and such like, usually called in the most ancient times Eithiopians, or worshippers of the dark Lingam, hence identified with Tartarus or Erebus—Hebrew Ereb, at once the West and Darkness. Bryant shows that these Kooths or Kyklops were greatly devoted to rearing Lophoi, or high altars of earth, many temples, subterranean passages, or caves such as I show in Plate VI., VII., and XIII., and strong high towers, especially on the sea coast.2 They were “the Minyæ who built the treasury at Orkoumenus,” which Pausanias says was “equal in workmanship to the pyramids of Egypt. . . . . In all parts whither they came, they erected noble structures, . . . . often dedicated to the chief deity, the Sun, under the name of Elorus and P-el-orus,”3 which is Siva, as a general expression of the Sun of Fertility, and Pi-el, or Pe-or as the Lingam. The Jewish story of “the dispersion” is but the echo of various eastern ones. Thus Hesiod tells us of the western move-ment of the Titans; and in the very old history of Asytia.written by Abydēnus in the Ionic dialect, we learn that it was these Titans who built Babel;4 of which we might almost be certain, were we not otherwise assured that none save this great building race attempted anything of this kind. The IO-nim were undoubtedly the Yoni worshippers among Akadians and Kaldians. They claim to be, and moot cer-tainly were, the leaders of Kaldian history for a great many centuries. Owing to Europe losingthc names and faith of this people, historians have only spoken of the IOnim as descendants of one Ion, Ionah, Jonah, or John, who were much “concerned in the building of the tower.” Their faith—“Skuthism”—says Eusebius, “prevailed from the deluge to the erecting of the tower,”5 and had he not been cramped by the flood-idea—that strange Jewish crytalization which has thrown Europe back many centuries in the investigation of history, and turned every promising pioneer out of the true course—Eusebius would have said, ‘from the earliest known times,’ and might perhaps, with the means at hand in his days, have given us some pre-Noachian landmarks. He agrees with others that Alorus or Orion, a shepherd, was the first King of Kaldia, and following Manetho, both he and Bryant conclude that a the “shepherd kings” of Egypt were “Cuseans.” Africanus styles them Phenicians,6 but the name, Huk Shasoo, means, rather, nomads—chiefs of Shasoo or Shosoo. We must not here expect greater identity or uniformity in faith than what we observe elsewhere. As we have Vishnooites, Sivaites, and Krishnaites, called Hindoos, so there are Roman, Greek, and Protestant Christians; and so it was in the case of the earliest followers of the male and female principle; they too were distinguished as the dark and white sects. Kyklopes, as the western form of Koothites, were those termed Hyper-boreans, 1 Faber, III. 377 to 399. Dr. Keating’s Ireland, I. 95. 2 Bryant, V. 190 to 211. 3 II. 25.

Very early Greeks “esteemed them a sacred and wonderful people.” Apollo, when he left the heavens, . . . . . . . “Sorrowing . . . passed Through many a doleful region, till he reached The sacred Hyperboreans.”1 It was these Cus, Skuths, or Kuthites, who gave Delos her rites, and discovered and established the oracle of Delphi, placing there the first prophet, “Olen the Hyperbo-rean.” By them, in unknown times, the Pala-tine, or hill of Pal, or Pi-el, was occupied; and if so, named after their phallic demi-god and patriarch, Pelus or P’Al (us), just as they named their high sacred mount in Chios, Mount Pi-el-en—“the one God Pi or P’al.” The name Boreades, by which Kooths were called, is evidently from the Akadian Pur or Fire, though, as often the case in mythology, this signifies rather “the rushing mighty wind,” or passion of the Kurios—the Holy Ghost idea. Boreas was a Sun- God who sprang from a cave, begot twelve horses by Arkite mares, had Solar fetes and Ophite extremities—all Hindo-Sanskrit ideas in connection with the Māroots. We must not suppose that in tracing out the history of Kyklopians and Kooths we are nearly at the base of European or other ethnology, but learn with humility as we have in the case of so-called “Indian aborigines,” that there are races in the recesses of many mountains, and in the depths of dark forests, far lower in the human scale than they; indeed, but little removed from the Lemures, and which have therefore given to large dark patches of Asia, the ethnographic name of Lemuria; so, far below Kabiri and Kyklopians, there muat also have been European Lemurians, if we could but trace them. Ethnologists, in spite of long research, have as yet only asked us to re-cognise in the nearly extinct Esquimaux of Greenland, Lapland. or Siberia, the aboriginal races of Europe—tribes, says Professor Owen, living in caves, eating raw flesh and fish in preference to cooked, and sleeping between the skins of the animals they feed on. This, says Sir John Lubbock, was the race which early Kelts, Goths, &c., drove north, aye, and Kooths and Kykloplians long before them, the former but continuing what the latter began. Esquimaux are very far removed from the little black Lemurian tribes of Asia, and take rank with our ordinary Indian hill tribes, such as the Gonda, Sooras, &c., of the east, to which I shall devote a separate chapter. Cabot in 1497 found two hundred Equimaux on a strip of the Labrador coast using birch canoes and seal skins; and their descendants are now living there more comfortably, and on the whole better, than the numerous British settlers on the north Canadian coast. They are Christians, and so-calIed Protestants, whilst the Mikmaks and mountaineers, whom the Red Indians so dread, are invariably Roman Catholics. The great movement of the Central Asian Tatars, under Gengis Kan, in the twefth century A.C., is held to have pressed also upon the Siberian. races, making these 1 Bryant, V. 146 to 170, quoting Pausanias and others."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 149advance, some towards Behring Straits, and others to Western Greenland. Two centuries before this, however, their Siberian ancestors, under “Erik the Red,” had passed over and partially peopled these regions, and to one of these movements, by north Asiatics, do we probably owe the influx into central Europe of Norsemen or North-men and Skandinavians generally. We further know of a hostile horde invading Greenland in the fourteenth century A.C., so that two hundred years appear to have been the recurring cycle for emigration in these cold and barren latitudes, as five hundred to six hundred and fifty years formed the period in the warmer and more fertile portions of southern Skuthic Asia. Of other tribes approaching to aborigines, we have, in northern Europe, Fins, Vins, or Phens, and to the south, a great race, who once lived over all the shores of the Bay of Biscay, and gave to it this name, but who now, as Basques or perhaps B’Askes (followers of As or Ar), are known only in the insignificant remnant, occupying the southern alignment of that bay and the most rugged parts of Spain. Here they have all but amalgamated with the inhabitants of the peninsula, long known as the habitat of Iberians, Andals, Albanians, etc., whose earlier home was in the steppes and fest-nesses of the Caucacus. The Map, Plate II., will assist the reader if he bear in mind the peculiar configuration, and that the names extend over several centuries. We may conclude that the north Caucasian Iberians are a branch or the parents of the south Caucasian Iranians. The name Ierne, given anciently to Ireland, and Ibernia to Spain, also Hibernia and Invernia, may spring from the same word—Ier, the tribal God. Aristotle callod the Irish of his day—the fourth century B.C.—Ierni (a Greek name, and.thought the most correct,1 as coming nearest to the present Gaelic, Eri), saying they dwelt in an island near Albion, “beyond the Keltæ,”2 which shows us that they were an old and distinct race. Diodoros called them Iris and cannibals3 and Solinus says that the Hibernian mother thrusts the first morsel of meat into the mouth of every male child with the point of a sword, and that there are no snakes in the island, but abundance of pasture. It would seem that the Ierni were known of long before the Albions or Kelts, for a poem attributed to Orpheus, and certainly as old as the sixth century B.C.,4. speaks of the people and their island as a matter quite well known; and so Ptolemy gives us even more details of “Iournia” than of Britain, and “as Ireland was never reduced nor even explored by the Romans, his authorities must have been other than Latins.” Tacitus, when speaking of “Agricola meditating the conquest of Ireland,” says the inhabitants “are not very different from the Britons.” “The present population,” writes Mr Latham, “belongs to the Gaelic branch of the Keltic stoek, a population which cannot be shown to have been introduced within the historic period.” Ireland, he adds, “has no remains referable to pagan Rome,” there-fore her very ancient stone ruins must be those of our “great builders,” who had populated the country before the non-building Keltic and Skandinavian influxes. 1 Smith’s G. and R.

To assert, as is commonly done, that the term Aryan is derived from the Sanskrit Arya—a term now-a-days, but not formerly, meaning “respect-able” and “venerable,” is etymologically and otherwise unreasonable, as we see from the subjoined selection of Sanskrit words. Even were it so derived, at second hand from Arya, it could only mean that there were certain castes worshipping a “great deity.” It is far more likely that Aryan of old had the signification of Arya, “a barbarian, unworthy person,” which the immigrants, as worshipping the god Ar or Al, would, as heretics, be at first considered though, in course of time, when they became rulers, and nobles, this term Arya would rise in estimation. just as descent from Norman invaders is now held among us to be nobke lineage. So Benfey tells us that an Arya used to signify the third, or even a lower caste, “a barbarian, unworthy per-son,” “petty shopkeeper” or trader, &c.; and he does not agree with those who think that the Aryans sprang from a high Asian cradle.1 When the Greeks sprang from Sanskrit Aryans, these had risen to be rulers, and so we have most words compounded with Ar, signifying superiority, &c., as Ar-istos, “best,” whence “aristocracy,” &c. I give on the next page a few words taken at random from a Greek dictionary, which point, I think, unmistakably to a god and worhip being at the root of all leading names and terms beginning with Ar, Er, Eir, or Jer, &c., and this at a period anterior to Greek, nay to so called Aryan times. In modern German we have Aar, and in old German, Aro, for an eagle; and in Kaldi, Eru is a kind of eagle or griffin, equivalent to tho cherubim of Genesis.2 The eagle is Vishnoo, the sun, the bird of Jove, to whom Jews give the body of a man or bull. It always represents god-like power and ubiquity. There is no doubt that Skythic Aryans were those who taught Greeks and Egyptians to worship Ares as a 1 Chips from a German Worshop, IV., 223.

This list might be multiplied to any extent in Latin and other tongues.

It is not pretended that we know of an original Aryan language; we only know of tongues which we may properly call Neo-Aryan, embracing Sanskrit, &c., or as we should perhaps more properly call them, the Prakrits and Pali of the East, of which the old Sanskrit is considered the parent. “Nothing whatever,” says Mr John Beames, “of the old Aryan has been preserved, or is likely to be discovered, although much may be, and has been guessed at from analogy;”2 and Max Müller seems to be of the same opinion throughout his first chapter on Comparative Mythology.3 Those who do not believe in man having ever been born “perfect” or altogether good, either physically or morally, may reasonably object to the idea of his having had a per-fected language, which he afterwards lost; and to the assertion of some philologists, that “clearly all the essential forms of grammar had been fully established before the first separation of the Aryan family took place;” and that the AIyan parent “died in giving birth to the modern Aryan dialects such as Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, &c.4 This tends to lead one up to the idea that there was a “perfect” Adam, who was capable of naming all creation; but who “fell from his high state,” a Zend and Jewish notion which, whether viewed physically or philologically, cannot be accepted.

In this ways but over a vast period of time, the Aryan and Shemitic characteristics would slowly develope, whilst the great undeveloped mass of the more peristent nomadic tribes would remain, as it were, beyond the formative or amalgamative stage, like the Turan horsemen .of Central Asia, and hence be very properly termed Turanian in speech. Early tribes and nations have always been named by rude though practical men —not philologists or philosophers, but mere observers of nature, who gave to them names in accordance with the “Standard,” Pole, Flag, Insignia, or Gods they carried; Shemites or Shemitics were so called because they bore aloft and worshipped Shem, Sen, or “the Sign”—the Sun, “Sun-Stone,” or symbol of Sen-Ar;1 and Aryans as the especial carriers of the A, AR Ra, or Ram-God, would be naturally called AR-ians. Simi1atly, the T u r a n i a n was no doubt one who worshipped and carried aloft some phallic or fire-pole with Toth, Tot, or Ta-Ur, as the phallic God of Light and Heat; this might be repre-sented in the Trident or Trisool of Siva, or the spear, tuft, torch, or other symbols seen in this Fig. 226, and in Fig. 66, p. 185, Vol. I. Natur-ally, the Aryan would take to the ploughshare, or the fourth symbol here shown in col. II.; he would call it “the Seedgiver,” and his AR-God, the “stirrer up of his goddess, Terra,” and once the name was started, all succeeding ploughers would retain it as suitable denoting the instru-ment of “Molly’s” fertility, for Molly is a form of Terra—“the mill,” from Mulita or Mylitta, rendered in O.H. German, Muli; in Bohemian, Mlun; Welsh, Melin; Greek, Mule; and Latin, Mola; so the AR which feeds the Mill and stirs Terra was considered a real God, and hence the lords of India have from time immemorial signed their names with this figure of the ploughshare, just as Boodhists have used the triform Yoni leaf, and Christian bishops the +. In later days, and no doubt in other languages, “the plough-share”—Vomer, actually meant the phallus, and its “furrow”—Sulcus, the pudendum muliebre,2 1 See the Shemitic standard given in p. 83 of previous chapter. 2 See Littleton’s Latin Dict, “Vomer,”—“itemmembrum virile, ut et Sulcus pro muliebri consimili translatione.” Trans.—“Also Phallus, just as furrowby like metaphor stands for the female organ.” So, Sita the wife of Rama, and Eve the wife of Adam, signify simply “the furrow” or “cleft.” "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 153which shows us the kind of Tupos Ar-otro-eides, or “plough symbol,” those Aryans carried as a “banner” at the head of their standards, or sceptres, or used as a head orna-ment, stamp, or in model; later peoples euphemized the phallus in the Ureus, or sacred serpent, regarding all of which Diodorns and others are explicit.1 We have elsewhere a great deal of evidence as to the sacred poles having a leather or fig-wood phallus at their point, which was a fit “tip-staff” for many of the festivals of Bubastes. In Greek, the ploughshare is eos, Hunis, or Hunnis, the derivation of which has always puzzled early scholars, but Sanskrit here aids us if we consider the gene- ral signification which words of this kind convey, of course interchanging S for H, as is always permissible. I give at foot a few specimens selected from Benfey’s Sanskcrit Dict.,2 and beg that they may be compared with the significations which Fürst gives us under the Hebrew term, crh H r sh, Haresh, or Harash, which is also the Arabic for ploughshare, and signifies “to cut into, split, grave, plough, fabricate, shine, grow, speak softly, enchant, practice magic,” also “an artificer or cutting instrument,” all suitable terms for Maha-deva, “a the shiner, fashioner, and fascinator.” More will appear in confirm.ation of this in my chapter on Hindooism, in regard to the investi-gation of the term Sisna—a word used for phallus in the Rig Veda—also Sthānoo, “the former of the seed,” and a place of fire. The Greek language is comparatively a very modern one for the purposes of the investigations we are here engaged in, and very undue importance has perhaps been given to it by the learned of Europe, in many cases because they knew no other lan-guages or faiths save those of Europe, and knew these in a thorough, or at least scien-tific manner. Even as Hellenes (which schoolboys are erroneously taught comes from mythic Hellen) the Greeks arrogated to themselves a name and faith which existed ages before either Athenians or Atikans, as we shall try hereafter to show. “Letters undoubtedly came to them late,” says Bryant, “and learning much later. There was no historian prior to Kadmus Milesius (540 B.C.), nor any public inscription of which we can be certified before the laws of Drako. The first Grecian who attempted to write in prose was Pherecydes, the philosopher,” who taught with Indians the doctrine of metempsychosis. He is said to have had Pythagoras as a pupil, and to have been a rival of Thales; many good writers say that Pherecydes was taught “from the secret books of the Phenicians;” others that he was “a disciple of the Egyptians and Kaldians; but but the latest writers in Smith’s Dictionary will not grant that he wrote prior to Kadmus of Miletus, so that up to this time, the language 1 Diod.

Thus it is said of the Kaldaic god, Mithras, that he first erected the obelisks of Egypt. Primus omnium id (obeliscorum erectionem) instituit Mitres, qui in solis urbs regnavit, somnio jussus;1 for Mitres was no other than M i t h r a s, the same as A r e s and Osiris . . . . . . He did not reign at Heliopolis, but was there adored; nor did he raise obelisks, but they were erected to his honour.”2 The followers of Mithras or Phlegyas were all branches of the great Amonian race, and so we find that the laws and cus-toms of Egyptan Aithiopians were almost precisely the same as those of their Kaldian brothers, and that though the Aithiopic lingual characters “were known only to a few of the priesthood, in Aithiopia (proper) they were the national character, and universally understood. . . . . . The priests in each were recluses and given to celibacy. They alike adopted the tonsure, and wore a garment of linen, and they use to carry in their hands a sceptre or staff, tupos AR-otroeides” (the plough sign), signifying the “Anthropos Ges, or great Generator”—that is Maha-Deva or Siva, the Lingam, or the obelisk, with which they so abundantly dotted their lands. Thus opposite to the island of Argæ-us (the ark of AR), the built Me-El-Ai or Kan-ob-us,3 with its temples and obelisks; and what more appropriate or similar to that which the same faith built elsewhere? thus looking on to the island of Rāma-Sirām, adjoining the sacred Cape Komāri and “that Eden of the Eastern Wave,” Ceylon, this faith built a populous city crowded with shrines and columns, all looking on to a holy Argha, or isle of Párvati. The speech of the Asiatic Irenes is of course older than the Sanskrit, for these, we are told by a host of learned writers, “were the ancestors of the Indians and Persians, of the Kelts, Greeks, Romans, Slavonians, and Teutons,”4 regarding which, however, we may reasonably entertain, with Benfey and Max Müller, some doubts, though these need not here be dwelt upon, as they do not interfere with the present argument. “The ancestors of Indic and lranic nations,” continues Professor Atwell, “went south and west, spreading over Hindostan, Persia, and Afganistan;” those who travelled towards Europe took “their way along the shore of the Caspain Saa, and then over the Cau-casus,” and so “along the northern shores of the Pontus. It is posaible that the Greek and Italian states were tho first to go forth from the great group, and it may be that the Teutons preceded the Slavionians.” In the strain also writers Max Müller:—“As sure as the six Roman dialects point to an original home of Italian shephards on the 1 Pliny, xxxvi. 8. 2 Bryant III. 245.

According to Herodotus, “they occupied the country south of the Ister (Danube), spread into Switzerland and the Tyrol, and, after occupying Gaul, Bel-gium, and Britain, were driven by the pressure of the Teutons to the extreme west and north of the British Isles.” The predecessors, then, of these Kelts, Belgæ, Galli, &c., were people of Iberian or Basque nationality, darkish and with curly hair,1 and their earliest language as now known to us, is divided into six dialects under two heads:— The Kymrik. The Gadhelik. Cornish (extinct). Gaelic (Picts and Scrots). British Kelts. { Welsh.   Erse.   Armorikan.  Manx,  etc.  Cornish has not been current even in Cornwall for three hundred years. Welsh—the Teuton term for “foreign,” was, by the Anglo-Saxons, called the British tongue; and Wales or Wallachia was to Saxons Briton or Breton, yet their language was not called Keltic, but Brey-sad. Early in the seventh century Saxons and Scots separated them-selves from the Angles and Picts, who became identified as the Pagan party. In the Esquimo, whom the ancient Ethiopians of the south and Turanian Asiatics of the east seem to have first invaded, we have clearly a people as much in advance of the aborigines, called “the Lemurian world,” or zone of the anthropoid apes—repre-sented by black Houssas, Mandingos, Fantis, etc.—as are early Basques, Fins, Irenes, Soomerians, etc., above the Esquimo. These last occupy in the west the place which Indian Kols, Beels, Sooars, Garos, Sontals, etc., do amidst our semi-Aryans or south Dravidians of India. We have, therefore, not yet found the European representative of the wild man of the Asiatic forest, for the Kuklopians, Kooths, etc., who were probably Turanian peoples, are the very utmost limit of quasi history. Many facts are now how-ever beginning to attract considerable attention, which, though long known to a select few of the learned, are yet comparatively new, for Greek ideas have hitherto, satisfied the general public. The Kooths or Cusians were known to have been a branch of the great Ethiopians, or Greek Aithiopes; but research as to them and their gods has until lately been dis-couraged, if not stopped, by scholars quashing the invetatigation with the remark that Aithiopes meant simply “black faces,” from a‡qw and Ôy (aitho and ops), and as the curly-headed, black Nubian presented himself to the enquirer’s mental vision, he rested content with his answer. He had not read an excellent chapter of the learned old Bryant2 and the authors he quotes, or he would have seen the necessity of further 1 Skene’s Celtic Scotland.  2 Bryant, Myth. III. 192 et seq.

Let us try and sift the history and see the faith of these early rulers of Europe and Asia, and then their name will follow as a natural sequence. We are told that “Joppa boasted of being built before the deluge, and of being the seat of Kepheus, king of the Aithiopians, the name under which the pre- Aryan and pre-Shemitic populations of Asia and Europe were known to the Greeks. . . . . The Kaldians were first called Kephenes (that is, Ke-pens), from King Kepheus;”1 and Pliny says—“Aithiopia was illustrious and powerful even as early as the reign of Memnon, during the Trojan War; and that its empire extended over Syria and the shores of Italy in the age of King Kepheus, is clear from the elgend of Andro-meda.” “The cuneiform monments bear similar testimony,” writes the Rev. Mr. Sayce;2 and this philologist asserts that the comparatively modem Hittites, Khata, or Egyptian Kheta are of this old non-Shemitic stock. Only in the 19th century B.C. did Shemites begin to partially displace these (shall we say) “Turanian builders.” For many centuries the two races seem to have rested content with the Euphrates as their boundary, and fortunately so, otherwise the Arab Shemites would have got none of the mythology, religion, culture, art, and even language which they did, and which alone enabled them to rise to empire, and become a truly great people. “The Shemitic vocabulary,” says Mr Sayce, “examined in the light of cuneiform revelations, shows much borrowing from the Akadian. . . . A considerable portion of Asyrian words, as well as Asyrian mythology, are immediately derived from an Akadian source. . . . . Most of the so-called bilateral roots and words relating to civilised life are taken from Turanian Babylonia.” These Turanians, he continues, gave to “the Shemites not only the general term for number, but also the definite expression for a large cipher (ham, ‘one hundred,’ is the Akadian Mih);” for “mathematical science had made much progress among Akadians.”3 From Akadian, it appears, come even such terms as “mouth” or “oracle”—the celebrated masculine form, Pi, Phe, or P’e, yp, hp, &c. which Mr. Sayce calls “the Akadian pa, with the plural pa-pa.” The Akadian called his son ibila, and the Asyrian abilu; and the former gave to the latter the name for “a city,” which these wandering Arabs knew not of. In Akadian, “city” is Uru or Eri, and a capital, or “city of the land,” was Uru-ci, Urqu, or “Erech.” The Shemite called, Uru, ryo, (Oir, or Eir), which later Asyrians made Al, or Alu, as in El-asar or Alu-assur,4 showing us that Ur or Er was 1 This, according to the Samaritan Bible, took place 2998 B.C., but later, according to Archbishop Usher. 2 Trans.

It was holy when the great Aithiopian King, Kepheus ruled over all these parts, and remained true to its aboriginal tribe and faith till the days of David, at least so the Jews assure us,1 adding that not only was Ierusalem its nane when captured by David in 1000 B.C. or there-abouts, but in 1450 B.C., when Joshua is said to have killad its “righteous Lord,” Adoni-Zedek, before Troy heard of a Greek language, or any specially Grecian Hellenes, and when even the Shemitic tongue was in its infancy in lower Babylonia; for, writes the Rev. Mr. Sayce, “the Shemitic language only appeared in the valley of the Euphrates towards the 16th century”2 B.C., and it must have been much earlier in Arabi Irak than in Hebron or the Aruam of UDMU, as the Asyrian tablets called that southern portion of Palestine, to which Joshua first led his desert hordes. It seems probable that the date given in the Old Testament of, say the 13th or 14th century B.C. for a Shemitic movement upon Syria, is somewhat near the truth, though there may have been also pioneer parties, headed by more or less important sheks or patriarchs, such as Abraham, in the cyclic wave-period of the previos 600 years3—not, however, leading to dominion or extirpation of the Koothic or other Turanian occupants, except in Egypt, where we have much detail regarding a “low bred” nomadic or “shepherd race,” called Hyksos, who seized on Lower Egypt, and drove out the kings of the Sixteenth Dynasty. No effort of the last of these kings—called by the Greeks Timaos, could here stem this Shemitic influx; so Lower Egypt was abandoned for Thebes, which probably then got the name of Aithiopian Egypt. In 1700 B.C. the Theban King, Amen-Ophis, succeeded in overthrowing the Hyksos, and the old races regained again all the sea-board of the Mediterranean, where the Phenician race, tongue and dialects long dominated, although very little of these have been spared to us, and of Hebrew and Hebrews nothing whatever. There is not a sign of a Jewish people till about what is called their “Eastern Captivity,”4 and the Rev. Mr Rodwell writes in the Trans. of the Biblical Archæo. Socy. that “the Hebrew of the Bible is no other than a dialectic variety of the Canaanitish or Phœnician tongue expressed in the Chaldean character, not brought, as has been taughtt by Abraham himself from Ur of the Chaldees, but adopted by the Israelites during their long captivities.”5 Could it possibly be otherwise, when we look at the facts? The Jews were a poor, ignorant, weak Arab tribe, living on the outskirts of a land occupied for long ages previously 1 Jos. x. 6; xv. 8-36; 2 Sam. v. 6. 2 Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.

Homer called this race Phens, Poludaidaloi—“artists of varied skill,” and later Romans prized them above all others for constructive talent. Pliny, Seneca, and Varro praise them in words which will never die;1 Jews said that David solicited their skilled labour, and that Solomon’s temple, small and simple though it was, could not be raised without their help; nay, though Ezra says be had these ensamples before him, and had seen all the fine buildings of Babylon, yet he too had to solicit their aid, else the walls of the city of Jehovah and Zerubabel’s second shrine could never have been con-structed.2 In all arts, trades, and manufactures this extraordinary people excelled every ancient race, and from the very earliest times, down and into the Roman period. Is it surprising, then, that their language and customs prevailed, wherever their skilled aid was required? that Africa, in its writing and languagee, was no less Punic—that is, Phenician—than Libyan, guided by these wondrous Peni or Tyrii Bilingues.3 The history of Britain during some past generntions, as the first great manufacturing country of modern times, shows how civilization, power and progress must ever follow industry and usefulness, and Phenicians to a great extentt in early days controlled “the sinews of war,” where this was their interest; but it too often proved more profitable to deal in swords and helmets than in “Tyrian purple” and costly brocade stuffs. Manu-facturers are not much given to writing, and these Pheni have been so parsimonious in their vowels, and lavish and indifferent in the use of B’s, D’s, R’s and S’s, that few philological students have attempted the translation of Phenician writings, though Phenician, and not Hebrew, is what alone we find traces of in Syria and Palestine. JEWS, a modern people.—The first notice of Jews is possibly that of certain She-mitic rulers of the Aram, paying tribute about 850 B.C. to Vool-Nirari, the successor of Shalmaneser of Syria, regarding which, however, much more is made by biblicists than the simple record warrants. This is the case also where Champollion affirms that men-tion is made on the Theban temples of the capture of certain towns of the land we call Judea, this being thought to prove the existence of Jews. Similar assumption takes place in regard to the hieratic papyri of the Leyden Museum, held to belong to the time of Rameses II., an inscription read on the rocks of El-Hamamat, and the dis-covery of some names like Chedor-laomer in the records of Babylonia; but this is all the “evidence” as to the existence of ancient Jews which has been advanced, and the most is made of it in Dr Birch’s opening address on the Progress of Biblical Archæ-ology, at the inauguration of that Society.4 The only logical conclusion justifiable when we give up the inspiration theory, is that Arabs and Syro-Phenicians were known to Asyrians and Egyptians, and this none would deny. Indeed we readily 1 Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch., p. 236. 2 Art. already quoted; Ezra iii. 7. See also what Fergusson says of them. His. Arch. 3 Ibid., and Polyb. III. 39; Virg. Æn. I., 661; Plaut. Pen.

Is it not so this day? Is a vast and rapidly spawning Shemitic continent like Arabia, not to influence the narrow delta of a river adjoining it, or the wild high-lands of Syria. to its north? Of course Arabs or Shemites were everywhere spread over Egypt, Syria, and Phenicia, as well as in their ancient seats of empire in Arabi Irak (Kaldia), and on the imperial mounds of Kalneh and Kouyunjik; but not necessarily as Jews. I cannot find that these last were anything more than possibly a peculiar religious sect of Arabs who settled down from their pristine nomadic habits, and obtained a quasi government under petty princes or Sheks, such as we have seen take place in the case of numerous Arabian and Indian sects. Mahomed sprang from such a clan and sect, and the history of Hajās and Himyaritic Arab tribes, furnishes us with many samples of similar settlements. Only about two hundred years or so after their return from Babylon did Jews seem to consolidate into a nation, and the collection and translating of their old mythic records—deciphered with much diliiculty by the diligent librarians of Ptolemy Philadelphus, from “old shreds and scraps of leather”—no doubt mate-rially aided in consolidating the people, and in welding them inro what they became—clans proud of a sort of mythic history bnilt up by Ezra and men acquainted with Baby-lonian records and popular cosmogonies.2 No efforts, say the leaders of the Biblical Archeological Society, have been able to find either amidst the numerous engravings on the rocks of Arabia Petrea or Palestine, any save Phenician inscriptions; not even a record of the Syro-Hebrew character, which was once thought to be the peculiar property of Hebrews. “Most of these inscriptions hithertoo discovered, do not date anterior to the Roman Empire.”3 “Few, if any, monuments (of Jews) have been obtained in Palestine” or the neighbouring countries, of any useful antiquity save the Moabite Stone, and the value of this last is all in favour of my previous arguments on these points. At the pool of Siloam we have an “inscription in the Phenician character as old as the time of the kings;” . . . “it is incised upon the walls of a rock chamber apparently dedicated to Baal who is men-tioned on it” ! So that here, in a most holy place of this “peculiar people,” we find only Phenicians, and these worshipping the Sun-God of Fertility, as was customary on every coast of Europe, from. unknown times down to the rise of Christianicy. The Biblical Archeological Society and British Museum authorities tell us frankly and clearly, that no Hebrew square character can be proved to exist till after the Baby- 1 “Ku-du-ur-ma-bu-uk has been conjectured,” says Smith, “to have some connection with the Chedar-laomer of Genesis” !—Early His., Ibid., p. 43. 2 Ezra wrote about 430, and his successor con-tinued to add to the same till 280 B.C. 3 Dr. Birch, President of Soc., op. cit., p. 9.

No monument, indeed,” continued Dr. Birch, “of greater antiquity, inscribed in the square character (Hebrew) has been found as yet OLDER THAN THE FIFTH CENTURY A.D. (the capitals are mine), and the coins of the Maccabean princes, as well as those of the revolter Barcochab, are impressed with Samaritan characters.” So that here we have the most complete confirmation of all I assert as the mythical history of a Judean peeople prior to a century or so B.C., and even then, only under such a government as Babylonian administrators had taught them to form, and the lax rule of the Selukidæ, followed by intermittent Roman government, permitted of. THE GOD IER.—Now as all ancient lands and cities, nay, standing camps went by the name of the great central Standard, Nissi, Pola, or Nishān of the god of the tribe whom the king or rule represents and at times personated (by wearing his god’s symbols),1 it is reasonable to believe that the Eir, Ier, or I-el, in Ier-u-salem—the cave and well of Mithras under “the Dome of the Rock”—was the name of the god fo the tribes. Eris, with Greeks, was goddess of Strife, the friend and sister of Ares—“in-satiable for blood and havoc,” the daughter of night, who threw the fatal apple into the assemble of the gods,a dn stirred up the Trojan war. Eiréne, however, was the goddess of Peace, and seeing that the Jebusites added Salem after Ier’s name, we are assured that this was the goddess represented by their cave and mount. Athens erected altars to her after conquering the Lacedemonians, and put a statue of her beside that of the prophetic Amphiaraus, carrying Plutus, God of Wealth, in her arms. Eirene was also put beside Hestia in the Prutaneion. Erebos was the God of Darkness and son of Chaos, whilst Eros became the sweet Amor or Cupido of the Latins; but Hesiod assures us that Eros was one of the earliest of gods, and the third person of the Trinity which Chaos created, viz., Ge, Tartarus, and Eros, which last, he says, was the first and most important—“the fundamental cause in the formaiton of the world, for without love nought can unite.” He was clearly Elohim and Jah, for he also brought order and harmony out of the primæval chaos. Nor are we left in doubt as to his symbol and office, for “among the places distinguished in his worship, Thespiæ in Beotia stands foremost, . . . and here the old representation of the God was a rude stone”2 or Lingam, as was also that sacred Jewish emblem under the dome of Shemites on Mount Moriah, for it was a stone they set up when they lost their ark.3 We are there-fore justified in concluding that this form of Er, El, Ier, Eir, Dir, Ion or Aur, ryr, was what gave the name tn the old Jebusite shrine, so prized by David and his tribe. Our cuniform translators are now able to assure us, that not in culture and language only did the old Akadian and Aithiopian teachers instruct all Shemites for 1 See p. 530 ante., in regard to Jerusalem, and p. 300, Trans.

"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 161the Rev. Mr Sayce in the volume already quoted, asserts that it is now a well ascertained fact that “the Shemitic traditions (and mythology) are for the most part referable to a Turanian source,” and if so, then the Old Testament stories are those retailed from the writings of “Pagan Akadians.” It is clear that in the Jebusites we have an Aithiopic sect, and their history we will now endeavour to trace. AITHIOPIANS.—As already said Aithiopians are popularly supposed to be the dark curly-headed Nubianst, because the Greeks called them Aithops, believing this to come from Aithos, “Black,” “Burnt,” “Heat,” and “Fire;” and Ops, “the Counte-nance,” “Eye,” “Voice,” or “Expression.” It seems far more probable, seeing this people existed as a great nation or nations long before Hellenes were born or Greek be-came a language, that these younger people got some such form of this name handed down to them and then corrupted it, and finding a powerful branch of darkish Aithio-pians in Upper Egypt, they concluded that the Greek word Aithos had been applied to them. This may also be the case with the Jews, for their writings only date from about the same period as the Greek, and they say the Aithiopes are Chusites, because Chus, cwk, in Hebrew is “black,” and throughout the Old Testament we see that the writers—belonging to only comparatively modern times, the Ezra and post-Ezra era—only knew of the Aithiopians of Upper Egypt.1 We do not question the fact of Aithi-opians being dark or swarthy, but deny the deduction hence drawn as erroneous and concealing the real truth, viz., that the people were called like all others after their chief god or faith. We see a similar error Greeks also made regarding the name of the Indian or Eastern Chamini Sopihte. Because some ascetics amongst these Kamites, or solo-fire worshippers, went about naked, or nearly so, the Greeks called them all Gym-nosophistæ, or “naked philosophers,” not understanding that they were solar priests called after their principal deity Kam, Cham, or Chom the Sun.2 Homer accurately describes the Indo-Skuthi or Cuthi—clearly the South Indian races and our Dravidian fellow-subjects of the Madros Presidency—at considerable length, from which this is an extract. “To the east a lovely country wide extends, India, whose borders the wide ocean bounds. On this the sun new rising from the main, Smiles pleased, and sheds its early orient beam. “The inhabitants are swart; and in their looks Betray the tints of the dark hyacinth, With moisture still abounding; hence their heads Are ever furnished with the sleekest hair.”2 The eastern Aithiopians, says Herodotus, in descrihing the hosts of nations in the great army of Xerxes (478 B.C.). “did not differ from the others in appearance, but only in their language and their hair; for the eastern Aithiopians are straight-haired, and those of Libya have hair more curly than any other people.”4 This means that those Indo-Aithopes were exactly like the Babylonians, Arabs, Medes, etc., in complexion; being Indians however, Herodotus says they “were marshalled with the Indians” of that gigantic force. It is clear that the Persians of that day were remotely allied to 1 Jos. Ant. I. 6, Hol. Mytho. Dict. 114. 2 Bryant III. 220. 3 Bryant’s Trans. III. 227. 4 Herod. VII. 70, Bohn’s Ed. 1872. "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 162the Aithiops, for, says Herodotus, the Persians in that army “were formerly called Kephenes by the Grecians, but by themselves and neighbours Artæans, for when Perseus, son of Danaë and Jupiter, came to Kepheus son of Belus, and married his daughter Andromeda, he had a son to whom he gave the name of Perses, and him he left in the country, for Kepheus had no male offspring”1—which last is a very import-ant fact, and shows that the Aithiops or Kephens—a name given to ancient Babylon-ians significant of their worship of a Tower or Petra-Solis2—here disappeared in name, that is, betook themselves to Aith or Ind, where we undouhtedly have them in various bodies on the Indus, Bombay Coast, and Madras Dravidia. Their cradle-land was appa-rently Western Asia, and their first great settlement, Ur of Kaldia; here at least a large body of them had long dwelt, and colonised most of western Asia and Egypt, instruct-ing all, not only in the arts of building and civilisation, but in religion. “Egypt itself was in some degree an Indian nation, having received a colony of that people by whom it was called Aït or Aëtia; hence it is said, ‘that Osiris was an Indian, by extraction,’ because the Cuthite religion came from the Tigris.”3 So Kepheus, king of Aithiopians, was called the son of Belus and married the beautiful Kassiopeia, by whom he became the father of Andromeda, whose beauty was so great that Poseidon sent a monster to devour her; but she was saved by Perseus,4 which means that the followers of Poseidon, or dwellers on the great seas, drove out the Aithipians. The early Zeus, and a son of Hephestus and Prometheus, were called Aithiopos, and the former was always wor-shipped as such in the island of Kios, the ancient name of which was Aith-alike, show-ing that Aithiops were its early settlers. It had two objects which would endear it to them, “a deep recess in which was a temple of Apollo, and a grove of palm trees,” as well as a lofty conical mountain called Pelieus and Elias,5 both solar titles. Numerous old authors show us that AIT or AT “was a sacred term—A TITLE OF THE CHIEF DEITY” of these Aithiopes; so we read Dioj ™p...qeton Aiqiy—“Aithiops was an epithet of Jove.”6 Only latterly were the countries occupied by these peoples called Aithiopia, being first styled Aith-eria and then At-lanta; their name surrounded all the early world, as old maps show us.7 The Erythrean seas are named after them as the Erythræi, and such names were common to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean, around all which their tribes were groups, for they were the early Arabes, in Egypt, the Oritœ or Auritœ,8 and in India the Sindi, etc. The popular idea of their name is refuted by even the most cursory investigation of the worth Aithein. This word signifies “to 1 Herod. VII. 61.

Turning to Benfey’s Sanskrit Dictionary we see that Indh, Idhe, Iddha, is “too kindle or shine,” so it is clear why races who bore the name of Ait and Ops—“the shiner,” and the serpent, owned such gods as Prometheus, Jove, and Perseus, and worshipped Rhea, Ops, and Python, in caves and mountains. The towns and dwelling-places everywhere tell the same story; thus Greeks write of a town of Aithiopia as having a fortress ATHA-mania, situated on a hill commanding Arg-ithea, the capital of a province on the summit of which was a temple to the great Aithops—Jupiter Akra-eus.1 From the earliest times down even to Greek days the Aith-i-ops were known as Indi; nay, we read that “the Cuthites styled Æthiopes, were the original Indi; they gave the name to the country which they occupied; hence Iarchus of India tells Apollonius, Ñti 'Aiqiopej men òkoun ™ntauqa, genoj 'Indixon.”2 So Diodorus Siculus writes: “almost in every place where their history occurs, the name of Indi will be found likewise,” which Bryant and the Rev. W. Holwell support, adding, “the chief inhabitants upon the Indus were Cuseans.” The Cuthites settled at Kolkus, the Colchis of the Greeks, and it was called Cutaia and Ethiopia. The sons of Cuth came into Syria and Phenicia under the titles of Kasus and Belus, where they founded many cities, and Strabo informs us that this country was called Aithi-opia. The Kadmians came into Eubea and here was an Aithiopium; Samothrace was called Ethiopia and Lesbos had the name of Ethiope and Makaria.3 There was a Fire and Phallic temple to their deity in Beotia where the most horrid rites took place.4 Bryant and others advance irrefutable arguments as to Skyths or Skuths being the same as Cyths or Cuths; it was common to add the sound of S before K’s and T’s as in the name of the isle of Kios or Chios, indifferently written Khio and Scio, and lat-terly called by Turks Saki. Knowing, as we now do, how long and early the so-called Akadians held all the delta of the Euphrates and Tigris; that Kaldia was esteemed Aithiopia proper;5 and that the great Arabian Shemitic influxes from 2300 B.C. down-wards, even failed to move these peoples out of Koothistan, Soosian, or Persis, till about 1600 B.C.; that even the Syrian Shemites (Jews and others) were called, though I think erroneously, by Tacitus, Æthiopum proles, or offspring of Aithiopes; that the races were not only clever builders but wise above all other peoples,6 (the Kuklops of Atika were called Akademians and founded the Akademia), it is clear that we see in them the head of the family of Amonians, Kulklopians, Kabiri, etc. It was long before they ceased to offer the fairest youths and maids on their Taphi, tombs or altar, and their 1 Smith’s G. and R.

The Latins continued the idea in Lux, Luceo, Jupiter Lucetius and Deo Leucaniæ, the Sol’s Fons.4 The grove was sacred to Lucus, the god there worshipped, and comes not, as popular fancy inverts the order, from Lucere “to shine,” but which shines not, hence forming our jeu d’ésprit, “Lu-cus a non lucendo.” “From Uc-El came Euclea Sacra, and Euklos Zeus,” etc., and the Greeks using c and g indifferently, make Uch into Euge, Euche or Euke, as in Euklos. So from Ak we have Akad, Achar—the name of the oldest city as well as of far later Nisibis—and the Akon of Palestine, so called after Herakles, the Sun, the god-man there worshipped. “Kadmus, the same as Ham, is a compound of Achad-Ham, rendered by the Greeks Academus and contracted Cadmus, from whence (as before said) the Academia at Athens was undoubtedly denominated.”5 Many urge that from Ham or Am sprang the Kuklopes, thus:— AMONIANSAN-AKSand (that is from An or Am and Ak.)KuklopesPenikesKadmiHiviOphiGalatæ, Illyrii, Keltæ We are told that because: Kuklopes invariably worshipped the Sun and Serpent, “hence they were styled, in different parts where they in time settled, Eur-op-ians, Or-op-ians, An-op-ians, In-op-ians, As-op-ians, El-op-ians, &c. . . . . . Kuklops, as a personage, was said to be the son of Ouranus, who, among the Amonians, was often styled Cœl or Cœlus, (K’El?) and was worshipped under the emblem of a serpent; hence the temple of the deity may have been originally called Cu-cœl-ops, Domus Cœli Pythonis, and the priests and people, Cu-cel-op-ians.”6 It is more than probably that all the serpent ideas of the world have sprung from the Turanian race, which is only saying that almost all symbolism and 1 Hol., p. 201; Bryant I. 503. 2 Hol., p. 439. 3 Hol., 127; Bryant I. 88. 4 See further Lycus and Lycurgus, Bryant III., 42. 5 Bryant I. 157; Hol., p. 3. 6 Hol., Myth.

The above is a goodly array, yet nothing like what archeological and antiquarian museums every day exhibit, to those who seek knowledge concerning these things. In the Tor-Ophis or Serpent Tower, Fig. 229, we see what these early great build-ers developed from the serpent wands and rods of ruder non-building peoples. Mont-fauçon calls this No. 229 “a revered gem” among Gnostic Christians, but very similar symbols are found among all faiths. The Hindoo usually forms this Fire-tower into a phallus, and Boodhists twist the Python round their huge ovate and conical stoopas, as I shall by-and-by show, and place beside it—that “charm” which wards off all misfortune—the yoni eye of Māya or “the all seeing one.” The early phallic god Hermes, or Kullenius of Atika, was the son of Maya, “mother of gods and men,” and came forth from her Akadian “Mount;” he is shown on the left as Fig. 227, where serpents—probably in coitu, are kissing the outspread wings representing Creation or the Womb, for in other places we find the reptile god—Passion—embracing, that is, worshipping the moon-goddess, from whom dart fire and serpent as already depicted and spoken of at page 228 of Vol. I. I repeat this figure on the next page, and with it those many stranga solar and serpentine forms and hieroglyphs, analogous to the above in form and idea, and so sacred to ancient races, and still specially revered by the Dravidians of northern India. Thus in column VIII-1, VI-3, 4 of Fig. 233, the ser-pent is seen passing through “the circle of life,” and in the latter it is winged as in Fig. "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 166227; in the first, his tail is adorned with the symbol of life—the cross—which also drops from the circle as in the planetary symbols shown in col. IX. In V-1, we have the most favourite figure of India to the present hour, and V-2 is a form of the Aleph in the first alphabet which arose in Akadian cradle lands. Fig. 228 is the old Egyptian sacred staff of Toth or Hermes Trismegistus, the “God of Healing” or of Medicine, that is, the Soter Kosmou. The hawk-head is that of Horus Ra, or the Fertilizer, supporting the brooding Isis, or Serpent and Moon, some-times mistakenly called the solar Uræus or sacred Srpent. Having no crown or male insignia, it is clearly the female idea, such as that of Siva carrying Soma the Moon, at Somnāt. Fig. 231 is the same idea from Maffei, usually called “the Staff of Eskulapius” (a name conjoining the Pillar, Sun, and Serpent), and said to be like those sculptured before Greeks were a nation, on the rock grotto of Trophonius beside images of Tro-phonios and Herkuna,1 of which I have written much elsewhere. Fig. 232 is also from Maffei, and called “the Trident of Jupiter-Ammon;” but it is what we see in daily use in many Indian temples where it is known as the Tri-sool, “three-thorned Enlivener,” or “Quickener” of Siva, with which “he strikes the yielding earth” goddess, and makes the barren rock yield water. Fig 233.—PLANETARY AND SECTARIAN SYMBOLS STILL IN USE THROUGHOUT THE EAST. Fig. 230 is the same idea usually connected with the Grecian myth of the Hespe-ridean garden, where a “fire-breathing dragon” guards the apples of life, as these Aryana metamorphosed the original Turanian idea. The early Egyptians said that the serpent Uræus was “light” or “the burning one” who guarded, as in Fig. 234, the sacred cyprus groves of Amenti—often described as a Gan-Eden or “Garden of Delight.” It is always “a symbol of fecundity;” and often of feminine form,2 as some say it is 1 Raol Rochette, Monumenta Inedita, pp. 21, 22.

This Fig. 234 illustrates the same idea as the fiery snakes guarding the Argha in the Sri-Lingas given on pages 120, 122, and 123, and watching over the Ark of Fire, Plate IV. 9, or the Cist in the old Tyrean coin, p. 97. THE ASHEL.—Eastern faiths teach us, when see-ing a serpent on a pole, or on the sacred tree or Ashel, as in Fig. 230, and elsewhere that this is Maha-deva in his energizing or fertile phase; that the Column, Obelisk, Rod, Baton, Caduceus, and Tree have all the same signifi-cance. To him, therefore, who understands this faith, it matters not whether Abraham “planted a grove” before he made his devotions to Jahveh (later Jews probably altered this word Ashel in Gen. xxi. 33), or erected an Asher or Lingam, as the best critics believe is here meant. The meaning is the same, viz., that the pa-triarch, who at other times required solemn vows to be made with the hand placed “in sectione circumcisionis,” here “erected an Ashel” before he could make his vow to his Jahveh by the “well of the vow”—Bar or Bar-Sheba.1 The planting of the Ashel is a similar act to that of Moses, who went to the top of a hill and erected his rod, and afterwards did the same on an alter, calling it Jahveh Nissi. I should perhaps explain, in regard to my remark as to later Jews probably altering the word Ashel in Gen. xxi. 33, that it is thought they here added a top to the r, r, of Asher thereby transforming it into an l, l, thus disguising, at least to the uninitiated, the gross phallic worship which the Lingam god, Asher, represented. A learned Hebraist writes to me in regard to this: “It was not an unfrequent thing to do so for euphemistic reasons. . . . . The word Ashel occurs three times in the Old Testament, and each time the translators seem to have had doubt as to its meaning. . . . The object was clearly sacred; and the English word ‘grove’ is, in most cases, a euphemism, as we see in ‘hangings for the grove,’3 the Hebrew being here Ashera, hrca the singular feminine; Asheroth, twrca, being the plural feminine—‘groves,’ and sometimes the Phenician goddess. This word is used thirty-nine times in the Old Testament, and in all cases has a phallic signifieation. The Rabbis say that lca is a Kabbalistic writing, called Notaricon, and is put for the three words, hyvl, hytc, hlyba, or food, drink, and companionship, which Abraham instituted. Hence Abraham planted or instituted an Inn in Beersheda. But though this may be the hidden mean-ing of the passage in Gen. xxi. 33, it will hardly serve for that in 1 Sam. xxxi. 13. . . . . .

The “Grove” or Ashera idea, is that of the Arga or Sri, in the Hin- doo term, Sri-Linga, denoting the two deities in conjunction; the Nissi or Ashel was the Tree (stem),1 and the Grove his sanctuary, as I need not explain to anyone who has read my chapter on Trees. Jove was the Quercus, and to erect or plant an oak or sacred tree was to erect a Maha-deva, facts which our translators forgot, or chose to hide, in both the Septuagint and Vulgate, causing thereby much confusion and many inaccuracies in thought and worship. But to return to more ancient peoples than even the first Jewish patriarchs of Ur. TOWER WORSHIP.—All the early races whom we called Akadians, Soomirs, Elamites, Kooths, &c., were very famous as erectors of Fire and Serpent Towers, and these commonly went by such names as Petra, Temples of Orion, Tor-Konor, Kar-Ons, &c., signifying towers or temples of the Sun, Light, &c. Such Tors or Petras were real shrines, being “esteemed Pelorian (Pi-El-Or), from the god Orus, the same as Cœlus2 (Ka-El) and Python”; this explains also why the fire censers of these ancients were of phallic design, as shown in figure 207, page 77. “The Grecians,” continue Bryant and Holwell, “confounded the people who raised these buildings with the structures themselves”;3 and therefore we hear them described as with a pole, tower and eye in their forehead, and called Kentauri or unicorn men. The eye is said by some to symbolize the light or fire which was placed on the top of the tower, no doubt in connection with Fire-Worship, as well as to assist mariners. The people were of the same race as those called “the one-eyed,” and followers of the one-eyed Jove and Siva; but, where adopting this symbol, they would be of the Yoni or IOnim sect, long one of the most powerful of the ancient world, and still so in many forms, from the Vishnooites of India to the worshippers of the virgin in all lands. We still see the eye, as in Fig. 233, I-4, II-2, 3, 4, and 6, on the forehead of millions in India, but the unicorn or spike has now become the Tri-Sool or Trident of Siva; yet few of the very oldest symbols, given in Fig. 233, are wanting on somo portion of the bodies of very pious Indians, as I have often ascertained from minute personal inspection of the votaries when engaged at their ablutions and pious re-anointings. The Kuklopians were always very partial to, and very powerful in Sicily, then called Trinakria, the kingdom of Polyphemus, son of Hephestus, the noisy God of growling Etna, that vast natural light tower. From Polyphemus, some say, sprang 1 Hindooism shows Siva as bursting forth from the Tree Stem or Pillar. 2 Holwell, p. 138. 3 In Cœlus, we see why Aith comes, as Liddel and Scott say, from Indh, Ind, or Indra, the Sun God, and its subseqeunt application to Zeus, “God of Life.”"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 169Gauls, Ilyrians, and Kelts.1 There were three famous Sicilian towers “on the three isles called the Kuklopum Scopuli, and that they were lighthouses is apparent from the name, which still remains, Faraglioni.” Some cosmogonies of the Kuklopes point unmistakably to true history, as that their father and mother (Ouranos and Ge) cast them forth with other Titani2—probably Turanians, into Tartarus, Europe, or the west, when they were used by Kronus to establish his kingdom, and by him in turn cast off. Zeus also made demands upon their great constructive power and skill, to overthrow Kronus and others; they provided Zeus with thunderbolts and lightning, Pluto with a helmet, and Poseidon with a trident. There were all classes amongst them, as among ourselves. Some in the wilds of high Thracia and elsewhere are described as lawless and insolent, devourers of human beings,3 and gigantic—reaping where they had not sown, and living in mountains and caves, under patriarchs or chiefs of clans, whose word was as the law of heaven. In general, however, history says that no war, art, or civilization was possible without them, and that everything good and valuable in stone, brass, and iron was accomplished by them; for they were Idœi Dak- tyli, Curetes, and Corybantes of the ancient world—the hands and fingers of all communities who required the aid of Kelmis, the smelter, Damnameneus, the hammer, and Akmon, the anvil—those Phrygian gods who, tradition says, first found the most precious of ores (iron) on Mount Ida. As Bryant and Holwell long ago told us, “great confusion has arisen from not considering that the Deity and the priest are named alike, and that the people—as the Heliadæ and Curitæ or Quirites—were often comprehended under the same title. The God Helius was styled Cur-Ait (Koot-ait?) and his priests had the same name; and the term Quirites among the Romans had the same origin. The ancient inhabitants of Ætolia, Eubes, and Akarnania were styled Curetes, and their country Curetica,”4 the root being the Sun, Cyrus or Kurus. The Hyperborean Kuklops, were those Ari-Maspians who built towers and “temples, named Kar-is or Kar-isia, in the top of which was preserved sacred fire.” The race abounded in Egypt and dominated throughout Sicily, and had there the same rites, particularly worshipping the ophite deity, under the name of Ophis.5 We must here notice some very typical specimens of Greek ignorance and error in regard to this people. Because their sacred talisman, the Eye or Yoni, was placed over the portals of their tombs and temples in Egpyt, Sicily, etc., Greeks said that this denoted the burial of a one-eyed race,6 and that their Orion had three fathers, because they mistook his temple or tower name—Tor-pator, in Sicily, for Tri-pator!7 1 Bacchylides-Natalis Comes. ix., Hol. 140. 2 Bryant III., 49-50.

The Temple of Apollo and Treasury of Delphi were built by the Kuklops, Trophonius and Agamedes, and to this race the Greeks owe the foundation and building of many of their finest old cities and the temples of their gods; so that justly they wrote that “everything great and noble was looked upon as Kuklopian,” even as in India we so often hear of all very ancient and large works being called Pandooan. Even Bryant—with that wondrous sagacity which characterizes his writings, but in perfect ignorance of the results to which his researches lead us, who now know so much of Indian history which was hidden from him—shows us that the chief ancient seat of these Aithiopian Kuklopians, Koothites, etc., was their Caucasian or Colchis home, and that they carried down this name to India’s farthest promontory, where, near to Komari’s Cape, they fished for pearls and wove that famous cloth, for which as Colchi they were renowned from the Campania of Italy to the Caucasian Alps as well as over all the valleys of the Indus and Ganges.1 Here Bryant also spies out with wonderful vision, that this South Indian “region is styled both Colica and Colchica,” and that its promontory is “supposed to be named Colis from Venus Colias,” which last, however, he utterly rejects, being unable, he says, to see what “a Grecian goddess has to do with the geography of India”! Nevertheless his first surmise is right, and his conjecture better than his reasoning. It is perfectly true the promontory is named after fair Kāma, or Koomāri, the goddess of Love and beauty, and seeing that Kamarina was the ancient name for UR of Kaldia, and that Kuklopians constantly repeated this same name in their Mediterranean settlements, that the God “UR or ORUS was also called Cham-Ur, and his priests Chamurin . . . . that this promontory Colchis Indica is rendered Comar by the author of Periplus;”2 that these ancient people called their high-Asian lands from which they came to Col-chis, Aia, after their god; and that this very name, IA or IYAR (Ier), is still the com-mon term for the deity along most of the Madras coast, and a title claimed by the highest Dravidian lineage, we have very positive proof that the same Caucasian Indi are here, as once peopled all western Asia and nearly all Europe, and many centuries before our present purer Aryan influxes occurred. AIA was by Greeks called “land,” by by Ammonians “a god,”3 probably IAO.

We have also Ad-Hām or Adām (the phallus of Shemites in Arabia and Asia Minor), as the name of this so sacred phallic cone (Fig. 235), in the green isle of Taprobane, Singala, or Ceylon—divided from Comaria, said these Koothites, by their Colchis Sinus; and this also accounts for the many notices in ancient Keltic lore (for we have no Aithiopian literature) re-garding Ceylon and its old names. As Bryant says, the name “Adam’s peak” or “Ad-Ham, was undoubtedly as old as the first Koothite inhabitants,” and was not given to it as is supposed by the Portuguese; he adds, though un-acquainted with the phallic faiths of India, “Ad-Ham is the king or deity —Ham, the Am-On of Egypt,” and the earliest Zeus in the East. Early Greeks very properly called him “the pillar Am,” or I-am (Iämus); his oracles were I-am-pi (Iämphi), and his priests who recited his praises or delivered his mandates in Iambic verse, the I-am-idæ. Ham was El and Or, Hermes and Petor, as well as Tithrambo and Osiris.2 The early home then of Koothites or Skuthite (Skythians), and Aithiopians—known of 3000 to 4000 B.C., seems to have been Central Asia, or some place north of the Kaukasus, which were by Greeks held to be the boundary of the world3 the kaukason 'escatoeita. From Kolkis these Kooths descended on the plains of Shinar, India, Egypt, etc., and as time wore on they were expelled in turn by Shemites and others. “One of the principal cities of Armenia was Cu-Coursus, which signifies the place of Chus,”4 and the early Akadian “city, UR, was called Cur, Cour, and Chora. . . Asa was rendered Gaza; Hala, Habor and Haran; Chala (Kāla), Chabor and Chara; so Arene, an ark or ship, was expressed Carene.” To India, the race doubtless brought Ur, the usual Indian affix for a town, as in Vel-oor, but often written and pronounced Voor, Or, Ar, and Ore, as Indore for Indra-poor, which is again the root of the Greek Purgos; German, Burg; English, Burgh; Persian, Boorj, meaning a Tower or Fort, erected usually on a Berg or hill. In the transition of Ur from Cur or Cour, and Gaza from Aza, we see the truth of 1 Apollon. Rhod. ii. 423. Homer, Odyss. I. 29.

Mr. Sayce’s remark, that in the Akadian as well as Akaimenian tongues, the initial K and G, or those aspirated, is constantly omitted, so that Kar or Khar, Khir or Kir, may read Ar or Ir, and hence Al or Il,1 the l and r being interchangeable. We have also seen that Eduth, the deity of “the testimony,” may read Geduth, and Pro-fessor W. Wright assures us, that “the initial h, h, is dispensed with in Hebrew on the ground that it is lost in Syriac,”2 so that the Hel or Hellanes, Hallam or Heli, or Kaldia or Greece, would appear in Hebrew as El, Elam, etc., and so the Greek word Hiero-polis or Hierusalem would with Jews become Iir-u-salem or Ier-oo-salem. The name of the early Soomers or Akadians, springs from probably the same source—the Sun, called Ak, Sam, or Sem. They were Sem-Ars, Soom-Ars, or Sem-Arim, and they reared their Shem, Sem, “sign,” “mark,” Nish-ān or obelisk, to Ra or Rama on the plain of Shem-Ar.3 Their great temple, says Bryant, was called, as Dravidian Indians still call theirs, Sama-Rama, a name signifying “God of Love” and Fertility—a name firt for the shrine of Sumars or Semarim. From such a people and country, says tradition, went forth Asur or Ashar to found his eponymous capital and nation, which, though ruled over by Shemites of Arabian extraction when known to history, yet could not have been so when Akadians and Kooths dominated throughout western Asia. Let us look into some of the latest discovered history of this people, as revealed in the cuniform. AKADIANS AND EARLIEST KALDIAN RACES.—To Turanian races we owe the cuniform writing and language. Those whom they called Ur-ites4 or Auri, their suc-cessors—the conquering Shemites—called Akadians; and their congenors, the Soomiri —a Shemitic name—Turanians called Ke-en-gi. Now to these Akads and Soomirs do we owe all the early great buildings of Babylonia, for their construction preceded the con-quest of the country by the Shemitic king Ham-mur-abi, who ruled no later than the 16th century B.C. He was a devoted worshipper of the Turanian deities, calling “Mardook, son of Hea,” his special God, and Mar-dook was then the presiding God of the very ancient city of Eri-du5—the first God who was symbolised by the human form, and whom Greeks therefore said represented their Zeus. He was Gusur “the Strong One”6 and “Lord of the men of Haram,” identifying, as the Rev. Mr. Sayce points out, this land of the Jewish patriarch with the worship and astrology of Akadians; for Mar-dook or Amarood, is in this form the planet Mercury or Dun-pa-udda, and as such called Dil-gan, “the Star of Babylon,” “the Spirit of Hea,” and in the mouth of Adar, “the fish Hea.” “In the inscriptions,” says Sayce, “Mar-dook in the south, answers to Assur in the north,”7 so we need no further assurance that he was the early southern 1 Trans.

This result is very important, for it shows us that not only Nimrod but Noah, Izdubar, and all great early leaders like Abram, Brahm, Roodra, &c., were also the Maha-Devas or Ashers of their day and nation. Babylonia, says Sayce, “may be described as the land of Merodach, just as it is called the land of Nimrod in Micah; and the same relation that exists between Assur and Nimrod in the Old Testament exists between Assur and Merodach in the native monuments.” THE LOGOS.—The Asyrians are held to have added M to Mar-dook’s Akadian name of Amar-ud, a word signifying “the circle of Ud or Ut,” “the Sun,” “Day,” or “Light,” again identifying him, as in the case of Siva, with the Sun and the Lingam. Mr Sayce shows how the Ut became Utu, Utici, and finally Utuc or Uduc, “a Spirit” in the Asyrian language; a transformation such as took place in the case of the early Hebrew Basar which, though once circumcised and called “flesh,” finally becomes “the Gospel,” and was then spiritualised into the Logos, but again “made flesh for us,” thus changing in idea according to the varying mental tendency of the times. The transformations and permutations of this divine thing, essence, attribute, or whatsoever we call it, have been very remarkable. Hippolytus, Bishop of Rome, denounces what he calls the heresies floating about regarding it in his time—the 3d century A.C., quoting largely from Aratus of Cilicia, a Greek poet and astronomer of the 3d century B.C. The ancient Logos, he says, “is denominated Mercury by the Greeks, and he fashioned the Lyre whilst yet an infant.” Aratus adds that1 “if Adam . . . imitate Lyra, that is, obey the Logos of God and submit to the law, he will receive Corona. . . . The Logos is he who, in the figure of a man, hinders the beast from reaching Corona.” Now this is the Mercury who forms the Lyre out of a dried tortoise on the shores of the Nile,2 and is, we are assured by these ancient men, the same as “Canis the ‘Logos’3 who guards the flocks from wolves. Like a dog he hunts the beasts from creation and destroys them, partly producing all things, and being what they express by the name Cyon, that is Canis or the Generator.” This Logos and planet is clearly the Akadian idea of Mardook, for the Bishop tells us that “only when Canis has risen do the crops prove productive;” without him though they may produee leaves, yet in reality “they have no life in them,” and not having struck root when he arises, they soon “undergo putrifaction.” “Canis is a God,” the real and “divine Logos, and judge of the quick and the dead. As the influence of Canis is observable in the vege-table productions of this world, so in plants of celestial growth—in men—is beheld the power of the Logos. From such cause, then, Cynosura, the second creation, is set in the firmament as an image of a creation by the Logos. . . . This image is fixed in heaven, being a certain wisdom to those capable of discerning it.”4 1 Arat. Phenom.

Thus pre-Christian people said it was not given to all to know these “mysteries of the Logos,” it was “hidden wisdom” which only true followers could understand—those only who trust in and abide on the Logos, as the branches on the Tree or Vine; without this there is no life in them; unfaithful followers of the Logos, though flourishing for a time, will be like that seed which falls on stony ground, and cannot yield good fruit. Aratus shows that “Perseus is the Logos, the winged offspring of Jove and Ketos the sea monster . . . the winged axle (or phallic wheel) that pierces both poles through the centre of the earth and turns the world round . . . who slays the beast and takes to himself Andromeda,” the fertile principle of nature,1—offices and pro-perties of most Messiahs, and here reminding us of those piscine affinities still clinging to Christ. The Logos is indeed one of the most ancient phallo-solar ideas, for it is but the amplification of the Kaldian if not Akadian MEMRA, regarding which we still shall find much in “that Sanskrit of the Turanian family,” as Mr Sayce terms the language of Akads, Elamitis, &c. The people of Elam and Soosa always remained tolerably apart. The Soosanian country is, in the cuniform, called Khapirti,2 Khalpirti, or probably Kal-vriti, that is, the land of Gal, Kāl, or Siva; and as we now know that the initial consonants may be dropped, we see how the god Al or Ar was also Siva and hence the origin of Ar-Abi, “the blest”—“Father AR,” or Father-land. It is common to translate words beginning with Kal, Al, El, and Ak as signifying “great” and “high,”so Elam3 is called “the highlands of Kaldia,” and Akadians are thought to be so named, because they came from northerly and high lands, and “descended upon Babylon;” but although this is so far correct, we must not forget the root or first meaning of the term “high” or “great,” any more than when we read that Polis, Akro, Ark, &c., are names applied to portions of a city. In Akadian, we are told that Kali is “great,” Kal or Kala, “a town,”4 and so we find a Kalneh in the south and a Kalah in the north; yet this was only the adopting of a godly eponym, as when a monarch called himself Asher, Nebo-pal-asher, &c. The root of Kāl or Al lies in that ubiquitous god, who has left the impress of his name in every corner of the world—in the immortal term Kal-dia and similar eastern names, as well as in numerous European ones, though it is not always possible to prove this last to those so ignorant as to require mathematical demonstration. In the language of Kassi, Kosœans, Soosanians, and Elamites, El, Kal, and Kala had a high and generally holy significance, and Gal and Goola were but 1 Hippol. Refut. IV. 49; Arat. Phenom.

The Soosanians, it is held, were more closely connected with Akadians as these are now known to us through Kaldian history, than were Elamites, and the following are stated to have been the names of their—the Soosanian—gods, as spelt by the Rev.

SPIRITS.—These Turanian occupants of ancient Babylonia were great believers in Spirits, and are usually said to have taught their Shemitic and Aryan successors; but I cannot myself see much race difference in respect to fetish and spirit reverence or fear. We, undoubtedly, see the earliegt spirit worship or dread, in Akadian litera-ture, and also the source of that mysterioua number seven in connection with Spirits and other sacred matters, which is alike common in Indian, Jewish, Christian, and Mahomedan sacred writings. The Izdubar tablets dwell especially on “Seven Evil Spirits,” which refrain the Jewish and Christian Scriptures merely take up and enlarge upon; see the Akadian “Song of the Seven Spirits,” and the prayers beginning, “O my God! my sins are seven times seven,”5 corresponding to such New Testament passages as the seven Spirits of Matt. xii. 43; Luke xi. 26; Rev. i. 4; iv. 5; v. 6; viii. 2; xv. 6; Tobit xii. 15, &c., where it is clear that all spirits were thought to be in sevens like the living creatures which, according to one account, went into the Noachian Ark. “The seven Spirits of God,” “the seven Angels,” &c.,6 are a very important portion of the Jehovistic staff; there seven Angels carry the seven plagues precisely as in Akad we are told, the seven spirit “messengers of the vengeance of Anu” did. Both gods let them loose upon earth to “utter thunders,” and “vials of wrath.” 1 Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch., III. ii. 476. 2 Ibid., p. 466, Rev. A. H.

THE AKADIAN LINGAM.—We are rapidly accumulating evidence of the so-called esoteric mysteries and objects of the early Aithiopian, Akadian, and Kaldian Faiths, that is of those Lingam and Yoni objects which Europe considers so very mysterious. In 1872, Mr H. F. Talbot read an interesting paper, with some important translations from the Akadian and Asyrian, on the religious belief of these peoples,1 which clearly establishes three very important points. First, that the representation of the Sun, and the “One Great God,” was a Lingam or Yoni, or symbols of both these organs; secondly, that the people believed firmly in immortality and the reward of the just; and thirdly, that the language, style, and often whole verses—nearly word for word—of the Hebrew Bible, are clearly borrowed from these cuniform writers. Amidst many gods, says Mr. Talbot, these people clearly believed in “the real unity of the divine nature,” and used a name equally applicable to God and heaven,2 show-ing here entire acoordance with the earliest Indian writers, with whom, indeed, they must have been familiar. They too, like Indians and all ancient races, had “a high and ever holy object,” which was called “ The ONE GOD (Ilu Ishtanu) who never fails. . . . . The Treasure of the Gods which depareth not. . . . . The Treasure of Heaven and Earth which shall not be removed. . . . . The Treasure which passeth not away.” and this was symbolised by “Mamit! Mamit! that which God and man are unable to explain.3” This Mamit the earlier Akadians called Sakba, which looks very like the Sanskrit Sakti or Yoni; now early Akads principally worshipped the feminine principle, and their version of the first of the above lines was “Sakba! Sakba! jewel not departing.” The term “jewel” is peculiarly common to Parvati as the Boss, Omphe, or Nabe (navel), and with the jewel or oval boss or shield do we still adorn many Christian temples, as did the Shemite king his Lebanon palace. As Parvati was the “lady of the mountain” or “mountainous lady”—the great Omphalos—so one of the chief titles of Ishtar in these tablets was Nin Harrissi or Ri Nin Harris, of the same signification,4 where Nin is the male and Hari a female term. The Akadian has two names, says Mr. Talbot, for the Mamit, and one he “pro-poses to read Nambaru,”5 but which is masculine and which feminine it is hard to say. An initial S or K is of little account in these old Kaldian tongues, Sakba 1 Trans. Soc.

Anyhow, both objects were, in character, like the Jewish Eduth, “Testimony,” or Covenant—a “God of the Testimony” or Testament, on which “thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;”1 for Mamit is, in Kaldia and Syriac, atmwm, Mumita, an oath or covenant; Latin, Juramentum; Greek, Orkos; which, Mr. Talbot here lays great stress on, is not only “an oath,” but “the object on which one swears—the witness of an oath.” Now Sivaites and all those whose fuith is more or less phallic, could equally swear on either organ, that is with their hand on the Nabe or boss, or in the ring stone,2 or on the Testes or Sri-Lingam; such was that on which Jacob made his oath or covenant with Laban; for, as a Galeed or “Heap of Witness,” it was an Omphe-like pile of stones; with a central pillar. On the top of this umba, they partook of a sacramental bread—Sacramentum Mysterium, “or holy Eucharist,” then, as now, a very grave and important proceed-ing; so Abraham made his solemn oath before an Ashel, and Josaiah went to the sacred pillar of the temple,3 when he made his so that Jews here confess to this Jupiter Fœderis or Mumitu deity, presiding over all their most sacred acts for some thirteen bundred years of their quasi history. “The Sacramentum, says Mr Talbot, who does not at all see the force of his dis-covery from my point of view, was not “a solemn feeling of the mind only, but a visible tangible object of adoration.” Even with Christians it was called “the Redemptionis Mysterium vel Sacramentum” and the Crutcis Sacramentum, that which, “when exposed to view, took away all evils.” On this account, the Hostie is still ever and again exposed and goes in procession round shrines and towns so that all evil may be warded off.4 The most solemn oaths were taken upon it, and it sufficed that those who desired to be cured, should but touch the edge of the Corpus domini or its drapery, to be made whole; for, says Paley, “a corporal oath” meant an oath on the Corporale or linen cloth surrounding the Corpus domini,5 and up to even these days, to touch the altar-cloth was to obtain a blessing, and swear with one hand on the altar-stone was as severe an oath as Abraham exacted from his servant on the “Circumcosionis sectio,” or as Jacob made when he “sware by the pachad (phallus) of his father Isaac.” Thus, then, Mamitu was this “great mystery” which, because the object sworn upon, became the Sacrament itself, “the Jewel,” “the only God,” and an emblem of such indescribable value that the people were never tiring of singing its praises, as Sivaites and Vishnooites do to this day in India. One refrain, which Mr Talbot gives us in the 1 Talbot, Ibid., p. 36; Matt. v. 33. 2 See that orifice in the Ark box, from which the Lingam springs, Fig. 162, p. 369, Vol. I., or Plate XI., “Ring Stones.” 3 Gen. xxi. 33; 2 Kings xxiii. 3.

The Mamit is “the All-cure,” “the Salvation” and Salvator, or Salmitu who “descends from the midst of the heavenly abyss or heavenly ocean,” that is the Argha or heavenly Ishtar. Like the Palla-Dium of Troy, it was “the Salvation” of the city, for Priam (Priapus?) fell with it and it descended from Jove as did the Ancile in the reign of Numa, and “the image of the great goddess Diana of Ephesus,” or that of Kubele at Pessinus in Phrygia.1 We see a similar signification in the word for Salva-tion or Savior, which the ancient Jebusites and Jews tacked on to the name of their God I-er. In the Akadian form of Salam, “to Save,” and the word still exists as a sacred exclamation in our Eastern Salām, a greeting, which means, “Health be to you,” or “God of Peace be with you.” The word Salvation or Saviour is very commonly applied to father and mother gods, and its hieroglyph in Egypt is that strange-looking loop or knot with hands usually across it, similar to the Sistrum of Isis, and denoting “tho place or house of Salvation”—“the cell of the cow” among Kelts. Isis constantly uses this knot, as when she tries to restore the soul to the body of Osiris; and Zoro-astrians say “the Savior, assisted by Genii, will resuscitate the bodies of the dead.” So Toth, Mercury, or Priapus was said to bring Salvation, and Toth was called “the divine word (Logos) of Amon,” who imparts life to Horus. Zoroastrians call the Virgin Mother (Kaosyak) “the one who brings Salvation,” the Eredat fedhri, a term applicable also to the Christian Mary. The Akadian looked forward to being received—“restored to life”—into the bosom of Ishtar or “hands of the Sun,” as Jew and Christian does “into Abraham’s bosom.” “The righteous man is to rise bright as a jewel and soar on high”—a Salmut-zu or “Saved soul,” and so long as he is sick he will be visited and comforted by the Gods. The Sun (Shem) is his abiding-place of happiness and his “Judge Supreme”—the Dainu-tsiri whose name is Daian-Nisi, “the Judge of men,” and he whom later peoples called Dio-nysus, Phoibos, and Osiris.3 We see here that the judge and king was called Daian or Dainu, (hence Di, Deus, &c.), with the male affix Nisi, a word like Zakar, signifying one with “a Banner or Standard,” that is a man. Ni and Pi, seem the same in Western Asia; see page 183 following. I will not here pause to show how closely the Hebrew writers borrowed their words 1 Ibid., Talbot, p. 37.

Thou stretchest forth thy hand.” CUNIFORM.—“ Who can compare with thee, O Ninib, Son of Bel? Thou didsnt not stretch forth thy hand,” &c. &c. So also have Jews and Christians but continued the old death or sick-bed rites of the ancient kingdoms. Thus the Third Person in the Trinity—Hea—directs the God or archangel Mardook to go to the dying, and after sundry bindings and tyings of kerchiefs to “sit on his bed . . . sprinkle holy water over him, when the Gods will receive his dying spirit. . . . Taking a white cloth . . . place Mamit (the lingam charm) in the sick man’s right band. . . when all evil spirits shall flee away.” This is very like “the last rites” as practised by most Christians. Written texts were of grent efficay, especially in sorrow or trouble; they were to be taken from holy books and hung round the chamber of the sick one, and even bound upon his brow, and, “next to the Mamit,” their powers to disperse all evil spirits were irresistible.2 We have returned to the hanging up of texts, and say our motives are now moral and spiritual improvement, but probably the wise, among the Kaldians, also looked to this, and only the ignorant to the lower and magical use. Mr Talbot rightly considers this phase of Babylonian faith to have been the origin of the Jewish phylacteries; good Jews still bind these on their left arm and forehead when they go to pray, and hence the }ylpt, Tephilin, or Phulakteria, now signifies “prayers” or “appendages to prayer,” from llp Pala, “to pray,” and hlpt, Tephileh,3 “prayer.” These were the articles or “preservatives” which Deut. vi. 6-9, is understood to mean as “a sign upon thine hand,” and “frontlets between thine eyes;” very particular instructions are given as to the construction of the Tephilin. As seen in the frontispiece of Mr. Allen’s work, the Tephilin for the arm appears to me an undoubted Lingam or Sri-Lingam, such as many Hindoos still wear upon. their person, but on the loins or high up on the arm, where generally hid by clothing. The high circular part of the Tephilin has an oval opening to the front, clearly the “All-cure,” so that we can-not acquit Jew of wearing, like all others, those sacred objects on their persons. The Jew prescribes that the Tephilin be made of the skin of some clean animal, “sewed together wet, and left in a block till dried and stiffened into the requisite form.” On one side of that intended for the head, should be the sacred and mysterious letter Shin, c—the Trinity, and on the opposite side a Shin with four heads. The knot formed at back of the head by the straps should be in the form of the hinge d 1 Ibid., p. 51. 2 Ibid., p. 55-6.

A person with the Tephilin on is holy and may not speak to any one, nor return any salutations even from the most distinguished.1 AKADIAN HELL.—Not only did Jews obtain their language and style from the sacred writings of Kaldia (as Babylonians had done from it Akadians), and purloin their cosmogony, and even the incidents in the life of the Kaldian Sargon from the records of his people, but they borrowed from the Kaldians their heaven of joys and rewards, and hell of horrors. All this the learned translator of the tablets—Mr H. Fox Talbot—makes very clear to us, and we thus see why these sacred abodes of futurity took their present form about the time of Christ. We have been accustomed to hear that the Syrian tribes got their ideas of heaven and hell from Persia but the tablets now show us, in a manner which admits of no gainsaying, where Persia, got these. Thus Ishtar—the Kaldian Proserpine and daughter of the Moon-God San—tells us that she saw “the shades of those who did evil upon earth, men, woman, and children,”3 and that she herself “of her free choice” went there “to punishment in accordance with her sins,” and for a frailty common to the sexes, on the occasion of her being rejected by man upon earth, for she offered herself to the new conqueror of the land only to be refused; on this she preferred the awful place of the damned and besought Ninkigal, Queen of Hades, to receive her. The cuniform thus described, some forty centuries ago, the dread abode: “ The house where all meet, the dwelling of the god Ir kala: The house which those who enter it never come out: The road which those who travel it never return: The house which those who enter it are deprived of light: Where earth is their food, their nourishment clay: Light is not seen, in darkness they dwell: Ghosts, like birds, flutter their wings there Upon the gate and the gate-bars: the dust lies undisturbed.”3 This very interesting and early record shows us many important points; as that we must not place implicit reliance or attribute too much significance to the sex of the deities, the translators having been here greatly perplexed, by finding that Nin, the almost universal male sign or name,4 actually stands in one place for Sarat, the Solar Queen; yet order can be generally descried in this apparent confusion if we know where to look for it; and nothing facilitates research into old faiths so much as a close synthetical, inductive and etymological treatment of old names, genders, and forma of gods, rivers, mountains, and cities. The characters and properties of the deities cau be commonly determined with the utmost accuracy where we find the same god called by various names in different nations or languages. Thus when we observe the Asyrian and Jewish Nebo has been in earlier days rendered by Akadians 1 Modern Jud., p. 313. 2 Trans. Soc. Bib. Archæol., II. ii. 346. 3 Trans. III., i. 118-120, “The Descent tablet.” 4 [It is nothing of the kind and has no gender signi-ficance in “Akkadian” (Sumerian).

Grivel,2 signfies in Akadian “one possessing beauty, splendour, brilliancy,” as does Nimrud in Asyrian, and, I would add, as Siva and Rama do in India. The Eastern translations of the Old Testament lend no countenance whatever to this early hero being “a mighty hunter,” but point undoubtedly to his being the Sun, Bāla-Rāma or Herakles of the race. The Izdubar tablets say he was a great worshipper of Soor-ip-ak, perhaps some feminine form of the Sun, or of this deity in the days when it was female, and Hur or the Moon, male; for Mr. Sayce assures us that Larsa—one of the four ancient cities mentioned on the Izdubar tablets—“is a a synonym for Surripac.” Noah, or Xisuthrus, was a Larancha-ite or Larsa-ite—that is, an Arkite or IOn-ite—not, however, in the sense of having anything to do with the Noachian Ark or “Flood,” for of this history knows nothing. Mr. Smith assuring us that “the inscriptions which have been hitherto found do not contain any certain allusion to the event.”3 Larsa or Larisa (Rasena) was the sixth oldest city of the land, Sipara, Nis-ara or Nis-ur,—“the cone of fire.” being the seventh. The following is the apparent chronological order of the first five cities:—1. Nip-ur or Kal-ane, the emblem of fire or light; 2. Er-idu or Ridu; 3. Ur; 4. Kar-ak, Kal-ak. or Ka-Ark,—Ark of the Sun; 5. Ur-uk, Ur-ak, Er-ek or “the Ark.” All show a fervent and enduring Phallic faith, overlapped in later times by fire and Sun-worship. KALDIAN ASTRONOMY.—Let us now look a little into ancient astronomical matters, and the earliet names which these people gave to times and seasons, for such always aid in the analysis of faiths and godly attributes. Akadians had what is called a “Cycle of Belus,” which orthodox writers (believers in the flood) say began in 2287 B.C. Berosus writes that a regular daily register was kept up for two thousand years of all the heavenly bodies, and that it was continued down to his time. The register was probably from times long prior to 2287 B.C. Even the Chinese Register reached further back than this by three hundred and fifty years—viz., to B.C. 2687 —thereby depriving the Jewish flood-myth of its universal character, a matter, how-ever, not now objected to by the latest of elastic bible commentators.4 It has been urged that the 720,000 years of astronomical observations which Epigenes says the Kaldians had recorded5 on bricks, were 2000 cycles of 360 days each (= 720,000), and that therefore he was merely repeating the statement of Berosus; but this seems only a quaint coincidence, for we have four other statements going as low 1 Trans. Soc. Bib. Archæol., III., i. 138. 2 Ibid., p. 142. This author here gives, as the Kaldaic translation of our Septuagint, “a strong man”—a Herakles, but not one having anything to do with “hunting wild animals.” 3 Ibid., I., i. 89; see also pp. 48, 49, ante.

The series appears to have been recorded on tablets of which we have seventy, called significantly Enu-Bili, or “the eye of Bel,” and belonging to the Library of the great and wise Sargon, King of Agane, of the 16th century B.C. Not only do all subsequent peoples quote from this “Eye of Bel,” but the language and scientific nomenclature of these Akads became the scientific lingua franca, and remained so for many thousand years. These astronomers considered that one of their great deities presided over each zodiacal sign or month, and they explain under what attribute the deity does so. Below I have gathered together from various sources what is here of more especial interest, but my readers must remember that the eastem zodiacal month does not correspond to more than three weeks of our present month. Thus Nisan or Aries, which we may call April, begins on the 21st of March, this being the time when the sun appears entering Aries, the earth being in Libra.2 ENGLISH KALDIAN.

Mr. Sayce, then offered up human sacrifices—“El” (i.e., the Aleim, Elohim or A-Bra), offered up his only son,”2 evidently the origin of the Abrahamic sacrifice of a Ram instead of Isaac. This, too, was the month of the great Christian sacrifice of “the Lamb of God,” when Elohim or Jehovah demanded “the innocent for the guilty,” in order “to satisfy his wrath.” In regard to the Kaldian and afterwards Jewish name of this “holy month of Nisan,” our Reverend translator tells us it means “this Nisa of Anu,” which I would read as “the Nishān or emblem of Anu,” for the month was sacred to Anu, “the great Creating Father,” Mr Sayce divides the cuniform word thus, “Ni-Sa-An-nu,” adding that Sa-a-mu or Samanu (Heb. \\hc) denotes “the dark blue stone”—the symbol and colour all over the east of the Lingam, Siva, Krishna, and Apollo; as Ni or Nin is “King”3 or the male emblem, we have in Ni-samanu “the king or deity of the dark Lingam.” Now to this god, in tropical lands, were males and first-lings of flocks sacrificed as thank-offerings for the wheat harvest which is being gar-nered, but in cold climes, the sacrifice is in hopes of favours to come, for blessings on the sprouting wheat and all vegetable life. The old way of spelling the European name of April was Aper-il, which better marks the probable Latin derivation from Aper, a boar—that universal symbol of salaciousness and fertile energy. Some say the name is derived from Aperio, “I open,” and that again from pario, “I produce light,”4 but the real meaning is best seen in “the opener”—Peor, for the proper sacrifice of the month was a boar without blemish. It is possible that Apar-il is Apis-El, for the next month (embracing part of April) is peculiarly that of Apis. Romans held April sacred to Venus, and “the 1st of April was specially set aside as Festum Veneris it Fortunæ Virilis; the probability therefore is that Aprilis was Aphrilis founded on the Greek name of Venus—Aphrodite.”5 Mardook was the messenger of Nisan and “the Rising Sun,”—one of the names of the salacious Mercury. Akadians considered Nisan or Bar their peculiarly holy month, as did Elamites that of Iyar.6 ARES or Aries was held to be the sun in its youthful vigour. Hebrews called it \\rt Tarem, Greeks, Keras, the horned-one, the word used by the writer of Judges viii. 13; because, say some, the sign has this appearnnce, though it is more like a palm-tree or Lingam. The “horizontal zodiac” of the ancients represents Ares as a man and woman sitting on a lotus of twelve petals, a sign of extreme fertility, and one which many rude tribes, like the Gabii, called the sign of “the Dove.” 1 The sun, says Sayce, entered Aries at the Vernal Equinox from 2540 B.C. to the time of Hipparchus and Taurus, back to 4698 B.C., which disturbs Gen. i. 2 Trans.

The Akadians would readily call him a “god of Peace,” Rest, or Salvation, as Air-oo-Salem may be translated; and the Phenician would even keep our term “God,” for he called Zeus “Gad of good fortune” or luck. The Kopts called this month Thor or light. SIVAN, the third month—May and June—as ending in Midsummer and great heats—is no doubt connected with the Eastern Solar god of heat, Siva. Europe sym-bolized it under Gemini, or “the Twins” which some early tribes show as a man and woman in a very indecent or suggeative position; other tribes likened the deity of this month to a crab or tortoise as a powerful terraqueous creature. In Hebrew and Latin the symbol of Gemini is two rigbt hands as well as twins, and a. double door, , or two doorposts. This the Egyptian “circular zodiac” represents as two men with two women between—one is Truth crowned with a bird; the other has a snake. In the “horizontal zodiac” a man is shown holding up a serpent with both hands, the tail being in his right. June was Juno’s month, and that primeval chaotic period when sundry tribes declared that their Elohim gods “brooded o’er the deep” or abyss of Mother Terra. There were many festivals in this month to Vesta and Mars, ending in Matralia, a natural consequence of the prohibitions of May, when the ancients thought marriage unlucky, and churches declared it was contrary to the law of their gods. JULY, or the fourth month, was sacred to the eagle among some wild tribes; to Julius Cesar, said some Latins; to “the Sun of Life,” or Adonis, said the writer of Ezekiel viii. 14; but to “the seizer of the seed,” the Crab, said the early Akadians. Tamooz is evidently the Akadian Tamzi, the husband of Allat or Istar, who descended into Hades after her husband Duzi, “the Sun of Life;”1 and this Tamzi, says the same reverend writer, is Xisuthrus—i.e., Noah, “Lord of the Ark.” AUGUST, or the fifth month, is by us connected with ideas of the lion and “fire that makes fire;” but many peoples call it the month of the ark and of hope. India connects it intimately with fetes to Cares, but Latins, forgetting probably the ancient lore, said it was sacred to their great Augustus. SEPTEMBER, or the sixth month, which Akadians called Elul, and Asyrians Ululu is always associated with Ishtar, Allat, Alala, or Alilat., all names of the zodiacal Astarte, whom Latins called Virgo. Many rude tribes symbolised the month by Vulcan’s hat, but Hebrews adopted Virgo as Phirko or Phirgo, which Rabbins said signified “the division” of the ten constellations, but more probably “the divisionn” was that “cleft,” “abyss,” or primeval woman—the real meaning of the Hebrew Havah, or Eve; Pluto also called Aphrodite, Virgo, and Neptune’s wife similarly sig-nifies the “division.” 1 Trans.

They called the month Tasritu, or Tisri, or dropping the initial, Esritu, said to mean “the sacred altar” or “sanctuary,” which seems to apply to the grain or store-house. Many tribes dedicated this month to “the great She-Wolf,” who is the forerunner of the much dreaded Typhon, now to be seen looming on the horizon as a Serpent or Scorpion. SCORPIO, sign of the eighth month, when the giant Nepheleim—Diana’s hounds, say some—spread themselves in cloudy masses over the earth. Mar-dook, “the Ruler of the Gods,” the “ever-prosperous,” was now prayed to by Akadians; for these, like Indians, look forward at this season to refreshing mild weather, as they begin to till their fields again for the hardy grains of northern lands. SAGITTARIUS, the ninth month—with us gloomy and wet, is erroneously thought to be an archer; he is rather the bull-like half man, half beast, or “bestial nature,” the meaning of the Kaldi word Ken-toor. The Greek signification admits of this and even gives Pudenda as the second meaning of Kentaur. Latins sometimes show him as a half man, half beast, with an arrow having two crosses, his forefeet in a boat and hind-feet in water. Others depict this month by “fair Vesta’s” lamp, for those who inhabit tropical lands or their borders are now thankfully garnering the millets or hot season crops, and anxiously watching the welcome springing of the young wheat, and praying for wintry showers which northern lands are more than satiated with. Lakshmi is specially feted in India during this month, and so in Italy we see wondrous, and at one time saw every gross festivity in honour of Kubele, Proserpine, and Pluto, styled Liberalia and Saturnolia.1 At this season commence many “mysteries” of all faiths originally more or less connected with seed—nay, “the causative seed,” as the good Bishop Hippolytus of Rome fully explains to us in trying to refute Gnostic, or, as he prefers to call them, “heresies of the Naaseni.”2 Even Adam—who, by-the-by, in cuniform is both man and monkey, A-du-mu—these early Christians and many Jews considered a mere generative agent; strange that Asyrians, Hebrews, &c. shouId have looked upon Adam—“the man” or the A-du-mu—and the anthropoid ape as the same, or so closely allied as to demand the same patriarchal name.3 Biahop Hippo-lytus tells us that “the mysteries” of the Asyrians, Phrygians, and of Isis, were simply “the Pudendum, and in the latter case, of Osiris.” “It stands,” he says, “in temples fronting Isis looking downwards. . . crowned with all its own fruits of things which are made . . .

But we shall return to this presently. TIBET, the tenth month, embraces all our Christmas mysteries and festivities; is ruled over by Capricornus, which Greeks learned from Kaldians was “the first goat-offerer,” Aigocerioj and was symbolised by a goat’s horn and the letter S; but many tribes deemed the month sacred to the peacock of the Queen of Heaven, which seems to be also the Akadian idea; see fourth column of page 182. Latins considered January sacred to Janus, and represented him as with two heads—Apollo and Saturn; others said the month was holy to the demi-“god of healing” and mirth—Eskulapius and his urn, which Ganymede was shown bringing along, full of divine ambrosia. SEBAT, the eleventh month—corresponding to the last third of January and first twenty days of February, was a time of many libations and purifications; hence, it is averred, derived from Februare. Aquarius, the water-god, rides high in the gloomy skies, and the Egyptian hieroglyph for water is his almost universal symbol, ΛΛΝΛΝ. It is in five divisions, and Greeks, apparently translating a Kaldian term, called it Udor Foros. Sometimes the sign is a man standing on an aquatic bird, and a woman 1 Hence he is the God “Terminus”—the presiding deity of all Domiciles, the male Hertha. 2 Hippokrates said, “The child of seven years old is half a father.”—Hippolytus.

MARCH or ADAR, the twelfth month, is presided over by Pisces or Iktheus, whom Hebrews at one time called Ak-zuth or “Posession;” other tribes said the month was sacred to Minerva’s Owl. The seed is now mostly sown and has taken fast hold~ and Andromeda and Pegasus adjoin the fishy constellation, yet the fish-idea is said by some to have been the mistake of Greeks, who fancied that the two faces or moons of Janus wcre two quaint-like fishes. The Mardook of the cuniform clearly became the Mercury of Greeks; indeed, the names are thought to be identical. Both, say Asyriologists, are called Sulpa-udu, and either name may be substituted for the other in the planetary system of the Akadians and Kaldians. Mr. Sayce says that Mercury was, with Babylonias Sekes, “the blue star” and “the burning fire” of the month of Ab (sacred to the goddess Alat), “the prince of the men of Karan,” that old Akadian city “whose laws are conjoined by Sargon with those of Assur, the ancient pre-Shemitic capital of Asyria;” he was “the king of light,” “Gusurra or wood work,” and of Tu or “decetti,” and the support of all houses. This planetary Siva is also “the Proclaimer,” “the Dog,” and “the star of Nebo”—all titles whieh proclaim him the creator Siva; but Mercury was also “chief of the beginning” which so large a section of early Christians lauded, and, indeed, worshipped, as “the primal man,” i.e., their Adam. “Samothracians,” writes Bishop Hippolytus of Rome,1 “expressly hand down in their mysteries. . . . . that Adam is the primal man; and habitually there stand in the temple of the Samothracians two images of naked men having both hands stretched aloft towards heaven and their pudenda turned upwards as is the case with the statue of Mercury on Mount Cyllene. And the aforesaid images are figures of the primal man and of that spiritual one who is born again”! This “chief of the beginning,” or Adam, says Bishop Hippolytus, the Gnostics and others call the “Chief stone of the corner,” and their “Rock”2— that term so constantly applied even now, by Jews and Christians, to God and Christ. Adam, said the Christians of the second, third, and fourth centuries, was “the blessed man” of “the three-fold body.”3 So Christ they held ascended “to the Good One— Priapus, (!) who antecedently caused the production of everything that exists,” and “for this reason,” continued these Christians, “is his statue placed in every temple and revered by every creature, and so there are images of him in the highways carrying over his head ripened fruits, the produce of the creation of which he is the cause.”4 It was later people who crystallized all the allegories and poetry of ancient writers into hard history, which all had to believe on pain of death and torture. Not so with the men of the first and second centuries. The paradise of the primal man Adam, said the 1 Ante-Nicene Library, VI.

The Serpent Nachash, or “Naas,” must, they said, be revered, for “he introduced virtue as well as vice,” inasmuch as “he entered into Adam,” “debauching him” after be had “debauched Eve,”3 so little were the stories of the Old Testament locked upon by these primitive believers as orthodoxy now teaches. The serpent was “the Wise One,” said these old Christians—the most perfect symbol of deity, to whom “is dedicated every shrine and every initiatory rite, and every mystery.” “He is a moist substance, . . . . . water, the originating principle, without which no existing things, immortal or mortal, animate or inanimate, could exist; . . . all things are subject to him, he is good and has all things in himself, as in the horn of the one-horned bull,”4 a double-entendre very clearly pointing to the Solar Python. Now the real value of all such writings to us is, that they expose the crude materials out of which the Christian faith has grown, and however regular and congruous our Bible stories may now appear to many of us, yet we must remember that these early views lay bare the real foundations on which has been built the goodly structure; for in the first and second centuries, if ever, men must have best known the real facts, and these so-called “innumerable heresies” are the prominent facts in the early history of the faith. The phallo-solar idea, then, was the one grand thought of early Christianity, and its roots were deep, and had been fed by the religions and sciences of great empires, which had cherished such from their birth as nomadic tribes, to their extinction as wise and learned nations. Kaldian faith and astrology were suffused with such figures and ideas as the above. Mars was a god and a planet, and “lord of the dark womb,” “abyss,” or “house of death;” the Nibet-Anu or “Nin of the ark of Anu.” So Goola proclaims 1 Ante-Nicene Library, p. 204.

Mr. Sayce, here quoted, thus makes her the wife of the Elohim and Jehovah of Genesis. Her name was “Nin-cigal, lady of the Great Earth —a form of Allat or Istar,”1 that is the Ruach or Spirit by which the Aleim created. This reverend writer says that “the more he examines Acadian mythology, the more solar does its character appear;” that its several personages are mostly forces of the sun, yet as identified also with stars, they assume a double character. Thus Venus at sunset was usually a female, but at sunrise “a male-ess,” as the ancient Asyrian translates the older Akadian term “male-female”—a useful word, and very expressive of the easy transition of sex in this lore, and corresponding to our womb-man or wom-man. There were observatories, it is said, in all great Kaldian towns, on the summits of high towers called Zigurats, of which every temple possessed one. The astronomers were called Abi, apparently the same as Papa, Rabi, or Father—names always applied by a people to their ecclesiastics or learned instructors. The full name was Aba mat Armai, i.e., astronomers of the Ar-mai, Ur-ma, or Ur-uma—people of “the land of the great Sun” and Light God, Ur, Ar, or Aur.4 Mr. Smith found Ar described on the oldest tablets of the Kaldian Sargon as “THE GREATEST OF THE GODS” and the founder of the kingdom Adi-Ar, commonly translated as “one devoted to the god Ar,” but here evidently the name of the great patriarch Al-Or or Al-Ar. Ar is the same as S-AR, Sur, Zur, hence the Sanskrit Soorya, and the Akadian Surru, which from “Fire” comes, we are told, to be the same as Kalu, “to burn,” reminding us of Kāla or Siva, “the consuming One.” Sit or Sid, the old Akadian term for Sun, must be the origin of all such words as Sur, Sun, San, Sam, and Sham, &c., for the oldest temples on the oldest sites were called Bet Sid or Bet Sidi, as that at Shere Gat or ancient Asher. Sid became Set among the Egyptian and Phenician coast tribes, and hence Sutech and Sohad which in time became among Hebrews Shadai or Shaddai, the “God Almighty” of the pristine patri-arch who went up to the Aram from Ur.5 Asher, it is thought, may be A-Sid, the prosthetic A being given to denote the great male god, and the active force of Sid as the pillar or Lingam God, that is, “the Sun Stone.”6 A-Sit is read in the oldest epigraphic monuments of Mesopotamia, reaching back to probably the twentieth century B.C. and therefore 1500 years older than the Old Testament writings as to Asher.

Oceanus and Atlas—from whom Atlantians, were the most powerful sons of Titœa, who early settled in Mauretania. a name embracing all the north-eastern parts of Africa, from the lofty summits of their sacred Atlas to the pillars of Herakles. Titans also peopled fair Iberia. Some thought that Mauritania was Erebus—darkness or Hell; but this seems to have arising from confusing Ereb, the West, bro, with Erebus, darkness. Hence Greek poets sang that Jove had consigned those Titans who had lifted him to power—i.e., advanced a purer Aryan and Solar Faith—to dark Erebus and Tartarus:— “ The gods victorious seiz’d the rebel crew And sent them, bound in adamantine chains, To earth’s deep caverns, and the shades of night. . . . . . . . . . . . Round them wide extend The dreary bounds of earth, and sea, and air, Of heaven above, and Tartarus below. There Atlas, son of great Iäpetus, With head inclin’d, and ever during arms Sustains the spacious heavens.”1 So Kallimakus calls Iberians as well as Mauretanians, Oyigonoj Tithoij. the offspring of Titans.2 The wars of “the Giants”—a common name for these great Titans, Tuthans, or Koothans—ended in driving them out of Semar or Sen-Ar, and giving possession to the sons Shem, who succeeded, we are told, not only to their wealth, but to their arts and civilisation, and the poet of the “Iliad” says, to their “sacred implements” as well. It is Lukos, “the God of Light,” in his Incarnation, Lykurgus, who is made to drive away the followers of the God of Nusa—Dio-nysus or Bacchus, he who was nursed by Tithenæ.3 “The Zuzims of Ham,” and the Emims of the land of Moab, “who dwelt there in times paat, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakims, who were accounted giants,” or Rephaim,4 are thus noticed in the Jewish sacred writings, and acknowledged by orthodoxy as warring in the 20th century B.C. The most ancient writers cilled this “the war of the giants,” “the flight of Bacchus,” and “the sufferings of the Gods;” and Greeks allude to it under the name of Skuthis-mus, clearly showing us that the people were Skuthæ.5 Strabo tells us that the Skuthæ or Sakæ drove the Kymmerians out of their country, which was all around the Sea of Azov and thereabouts, that is, of the As-eans or Asians.6 We must guard against a misuse of this term Skythian, for Greeks and others have too freely applied it towards all the northern peoples in Europe as well as Asia, 1 Hesiod.

They said there were from 50 to 300 Skythic nations talking distinct languages, and that some were learned and civilized, whilst others were rude and even “inhuman” to the last degree.1 The general result of historical criticism seems to tend towards placing Skyths over all the northern portion of “the wor1d as known to the ancients,” and the Aithiopes over its southern circumfer-ence.2 But these positions must be understood as embracing two different periods of time, probably 2000 years, for Skuths were Kooths, and both members of the Athiopian family, though here seen separated. In the case of the Madras Dravidians, 2000 to 3000 B.C., and the Vedic Aryans of the ancient Panjab, of 1000 to 1500 B.C., the dif-ference of the people is so complete as to even seem one of race. Long before the dawn of Hellenic history there were Skuthæ, famed for their “extensive commerce and superior science,” called Colchians, Iberians, Kymerians, Hyperboreans, Alani, Amazonians, Alazonians, &c.,3 all around and about Asia Minor; and still in a world outside these, “Skuths and Keltæ.” The addition of the S (sigma) or S, says Bryant, has been to us a fatal blind; so Kuths became Skuths, as Ur became Sour; the priests of El, thc Elli, were called Selli, the Alpes Kottiæ, the Skotiæ, and the Alpi the Salpia Ore. With Latins, `Ulh. became Sylva; Erpo, Serpo; and Als, 'Alj, Sal, as I have elsewhere shown. The Welsh and many others used S as an aspirate. All the races just named, those upon the Phasis and Thermodon, and those occu-pying Bœtica in Iberia, nay “Bœotians and Athenenians were, in a great measure, Cuthian.”4 Epiphanius, who wrote quite an epitome of Skuthic history, says; “Those nations which reached southward, where the two great continents of Europe and Asia incline to each other and EW connected, were universally styled Skuthai, according to an appellation of long standing.”5 They were “the Chaldaic Ionim under another name,” says Eusebius. The Fathers of the Church termed the age before the flood, “Barbarous,” that following, Skuthismus, after which came the Hellenismus—a phase still in vigour at the dawn of Grecian history. None of us can yet speak with any certainty regarding either of the first periods, nor the early part of the latter. Much seems “lost beyond the hope of recovery, and the most interesting, the opening scenes of the childhood of the human race, are known to us by fragments only.”6 When they first break upon the philologist’s vision, we find a grammar “containing the germs of all the Turanian as well as Aryan and Semitic forms of speech,” which period we now call the RHE-MATIC, or that in which language was in an unsettled and agglutinative stage. It is succeeded by the Dialectic, when the three great classes of language entered upon the Formative, or amalgative period, like the nomads themselves when they settled down 1 Bryant, III. 137. 2 See my Pl. II. and circular figure in corner. 3 Bryant, III. 145 4 Bryant, III. 147. Max Müller shows us that in Sanskrit and Gothic great liberties are taken with s and h, see Chips, II. 39. 5 Epiphanius, Adv.

The wisest must yet confess, with Max Müller, that “we know nothing of the Aryan race before it was broken up into different nationalities, such as Indian, Greek, Roman, Teutonic, and Keltic”—a statement. however, which seems to contain an error, inasmuch as it assumes that there was a perfect community, with a full, flowing language, instead of merely the wild man advancing gradually through all the usual stages of physical and mental development which we see every race and nation still doing. Thus the author frequently insists “that all the essential forms of grammar had been fully framed and established before the firat separation of the Aryan family took place;”1 a theory only tenable by those who think that man was created “perfect,” and able to name “all the beasts of the field, and birds of the air, and every living creatue,” and that “he fell from this high estate.” It seems sufficient to say that during the Nomadic or Rhematitic stage, the nomads frequently met, nay, per-haps sprang from the same pastures or hunting grounds, and had much speech in common, especially as regards such names as Sun, Moon, Stars, Fire, Water, Father, Mother, and that of common. animals; they probably recognised the same primitive verbs and nouns, denoting possession, gifts, sacrifices, being, having, &c. So long as mankind roamed from mid Asia to Arabia, and all over Africa and Europe, as Aithiopes did, it must have been impossible to keep to either one language or deity; but when they settled, all this would cease, and those worshipping Helios and his Ain, or fons, would be called El-Ains, or Elanite, as those who followed Soorya or Asoorya, were termed Syriams and Asyrians, etc.; then also, language, idioms, and cus-toms, mythologies and gods would all assume characteristics peculiar to individual char-acter, though freely modified by the local circumstances of each land or settlement, as well as in some measure by the prevailing ideas which were found existing there. As Bryant says, “how was it possible for an H e l l e n i c era to have existed before the name of H e l l a s was known, or the nation in being,” for Greeks are no exception to our rule of a people being called after their primitive gods or faith, and El-ain (Solis fons) was the origin of the general term Elanismus, which I o n i a n s as-pirated into `Ellhnismoj, Hellenismos. “One of the titles of the Cusean shepherds who came into Egypt was derived from El-Ain—‘the Fountain of Light’—which they worshipped . . . . whence Greeks . . . . are, by many writers, styled Poimenes Hellenes, or Hellenic shepherds, being truly El-Anes, and by race Cuthites.”2 Both Eusebius and Epiphanius assure us that Hellenism and worship of steli or pillars began in the days of “Phalec” or Peleg, “the Divider” or Maha-deva; in fact, that this Solo-phallic faith then arose and startled the world, i.e., about the end of the twenty- first century B.C., when, says Eusebiis, Phalec’s grandson, Sarug, “the Branch,” intro- 1 Ibid., p. 20. 2 Bryant (and others), III., 151, 152."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 193duced Hellenismus.1 All Syria perfectly understood that Helios was Zeus Hellenius and that he, as well as the Jahveh of Phenicians and Jews, had a celebrated shrine on Mount Gerizim, that Arkite mount facing the male one of Ebal, Eb-Al, or Neb-Al.2 It is only some Greek students of these days who require to be reminded of all this. To the present hour, say good Samaritans, all must turn in prayer to the Kibla or Ark on Holy Gerizm, for on this is the Kub or cup of Kubele; and this, says Capt. Warren,3 these races have here practised from before the captivity to the present hour, which, being some two thousand five hundred years, shows the durability of this Kibla or Arkite faith. The sacred rock on the summit of Gerizim has a small hole in it, called “the Holy of Holies,” where Abraham sacrificed, Jaeob the IOnite dreamt, and the Ark rested; and here still are lambs sacrificed, especially the Paschal of the vernal year. We have a re-production of the phallic god—“Peleg the Divider”—in Peleus and Pelias, whom early Greeks worshipped. These were the countrymen and co-religionists of the \\tk, Kuthim, those “dividers,” “engravers and writers,”4 whose age the erring poets of Greece said was “a golden one;” thinking, perhaps, that the cuseuib Genoj, Ku-seion Genos, was cruseion, Kruseion, or “age of god;” after making which error they followed it up to its necessary outcome by establishing silver, brazen, and iron ages also.5 Kut, tk, we see in Fürst, signified, at different times, all the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean, from the Nile to the Bosporus, and Kutin or Chittim, \\ytk, would be the country of Kuths; but Greeks were possibly misled by \\tk k t m, mean-ing “gold,” as well as “the dividers,” “cleansers,” and “purifiers of it.” It is clear that they applied the term Kruseion Genos to Kuthites, for they say it was this Golden Race who built the Olympian temples.6 The builders soon became too learned, and scoffed a.t the very gods whose noble shrines they had erected, like not a few builders of our day; so Jove or Jovites drove them out of the land. Johannes Antiochenes styles the people of Midian Hellenes; and speaking of Moses, who married the daughter of Jethro—the Cuthite and chief priest of Midian, he represents the woman as the daughter of Jother, High priest of the Hellenes.” So we still see in the land of Midian, as did Ptolemy, a city called El-ain, which Josephus calls Ailane, and adjoining it are the present Ain-Mosh, or “fountains of Mo-sheh,” meaning those whose waters may be used.7 Various parts of the Red Sea have been named Sinus Elanites, for the primitive peoples were Ellane, and “the Arabs about Akaba are (even now) called Allauni”8—no doubt, as they would explainj after Alla their ancient and 1 Gen. xi. 16-22; Epiph.

"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 194present god or El. We must not forget, however, that Hellen, who was at first a male, became among IOnim, whether Kaldian or Greek, a woman, and the principle or organ of fertility—if female, the Ioni or Yoni; if male, the sun—Ion—“the burning and shining light,” Helios, Osiris, and Apollo.1 The Greeks were both I o n i m and H e l l e n e s; but all other nations were so also, we must not foist the langunge or religion of the former on the latter. This is often done, as in the case of the Hellenes, or Hellenic shepherds of Egypt, who, we know, were Auritæ, or Oritæ, “C u t h i c Shepherds” and “Hellenic Princes.” They reigned in the infancy of the Egyptian nation, long prior to the Greek Hellen, daughter of their crystallised Deucalion; for the very ancient Hellen or El-Anes was the Prōtogenia or first-born of woman, and the child of the Sun;2 such a god as the dwelled in Elam—that old, old Helan—would be most likely to adopt. The Hellenic language of Egypt was one which seems to have succeeded the Cuthite Akadian, or pro-Babylonian, and been introduced by Noê or Neo-Agathodaimon, who claimed the serpent as his symbol. Manetho called Cuthite-Hellenic “the sacred language of Egypt,” and it brought with it to the Nile very much the same mythologies and faith as another branch of the same stream carried into Greece. Philo-Judæus, as Bryant shows, has been the great misleader in thus Grecianising Egypt; and all the subsequent writers, as Clemens Alexandrinus, and other “Fathers,” do but copy his mistake.3 Ebn Batriak styles Z o r o a s t e r “the author of Tsabean Worship and an Iūna-H e l l e n;” and Eusebius says “Hellen was the son of the person who escaped the flood,”4 which merely identifies Noah and HeIlen with the Sun; or if we assume, with Herakleitus, that “men are mortal gods, and gods but immortal men,” then Hellen is K a m or C h a m, the son of Noah, for fathen and son read alike in this lore. Many writers, as Diodorus, identify Hellen and Ion,5—the Babylonian bead of their Ionim, and these the Hebrew Jeremiah calls “the Oppressing Sword;” but the Septuagint makes this the “Hellenic Sword,”6 without any idea connected with Greece or Greeks. The famous oracle of Dodona belonged to Hellenes, called “Elli and Selli, which are terms of the same import derived from El and Sel, two names of the Sun;” and the Latins named their priesthood Salii, because “Elli and Selli were the priests of this oracle,”7 We find that the Cuthite-Amonians worshipped Ham or Am not only as Elli or Helios, but as Dis and Dios; and hence the very ancient Egyptian city Dios-polis. So Koothites styled the Sun Pleguas Or Phlegyas, he who Greeks said was the son of Ares and King of Beotia, and who set fire to the. temple of Apollo, and had here no offering, i.e., who being pure phallic worshippers, resisited the new Apollonic heresy; they did not succeed, and were driven forth. We are told that with Kuthites, 1 Bryant, III. 156. 2 Bryant quoting Africanus, Syncellus, and Appollodorus.

This was according to the “inspired writer” of Gen. x. the country of the most prolific of all mankind, for the progeny of Ham (Kuth), Shem and Japhet, were, he says, as thirty-one, twenty-six, and fourteen. Ham or Am was Ait, Aith, or 'Aitoj, a name long applied to both Egypt and the Nile,3 signifying the same as El-Am, Hel-ain or the Sun; the more modern Hellanites of Atika were never tired of compounding the initial Ait or 'Aiq, as they wrote it, with their sacrcd names. They called 'Aiq-oy, the sun’s disk, for this was commonly depicted surrounded by the Ops, Python or Serpent. Ath-Ur (Athyr) was one of the Egyptian months—when Ath gave special light; and our Keltic demi-god Arth-ur is from the same source. The shepherd kings of Egypt called their city at the head of the delta Ath-ur Athur-ai, “the place of Arthur”4 and here Ur, Or, or Horus reigned supreme. As Ait was the centre of the earth emotions, so this name was given to the heart in the animal frame,5 and, for the same reason, to the Nile as the life of Egypt; the heart over a vase of incense was the emblem of Egypt. Homer calls the eagle the Aëtos Aithon, or most powerful of birds, which can gaze without covering its eyes on the sun’s disk, and loves to soar near to him—an idea which probably travelled from the land of the Vedas where the eagle is called the Varāha, vehicle or messenger of Vishnoo, the sun. Even in Eusebius’ days, south-east Mesopotamia and “beyond the rivers of Kuthia” seems to have been called Aithiopia, whilst Jerome still calls the cradle-land of high Colchis the country of Aithiopians, saying that St. Andrew preached the gospel here to them.6 The original name Ar-Ab-es, or Arabians, is of course from the same source as Ireni and Aryans, which Liddell and Scott show is derived from the Sanskrit god of Light, so the Arabian followers of Kadmus, as the Kuthites were styled—Arabes hoi sun Kadmō, Arabians with Cadmus, and Eubea, the place where they first landed in Greece, was called Aithiopium, as was also Samothraké, Lesbos and Makaria.7 It was as the Er-uth-ri that the Aithiopes gave: the name Erythreum mare to all that was known of eastern seas, from the Gulf of El-anes or Akaba to “the Eden of the eastern wave”—fair Taprobane, Sinhala or Ceylon, situated, says the poet Dionysius, “towards the golden Chernonese,” a continent, however, which was not unknown in early Aithiopic days. 1 Bryant, III. 178; Josephus Ants., ix. 14 and xi. 4. 2 Strabo, I. 73; Bryant III. 183. 3 Bryant, I. 18, 18, and III. 181; Stephanus of Byzantium, Homer, &c. 4 Ibid., pp. 19, 20. 5 Ait or Athis also a euphemism for the Phallus.

Here, says Strabo, was the first Hellas, i.e., Hellan or Ell-An, for Greeks were prone to confuse us by changing n into s;5 and here amidst the highest mountains of Epirus, writes Aristotle, resided those “Selli who were then styled Græci and now Hellenes.” The Dodanim or aborigines of the race of J a v a n were here styled Barbari, “but the temple was founded by people from Egypt and Syria, Ellopians, Pelasgi and Hellenes.”6 The chief of these people was the Sun as Prometheus, Xuth, Zeuth or Zeus (all the same person) and the father or god of Ellanes, Hellenes, Xuth, (Iones) or Iannes, whom we are told “all foreigners very justly call Grecians.”7 Ianna was the land of Javan, and Hellas was of old called Ian or Javan, and Ian was the son, i.e., follower of Xuth. All the coast of Asia Minor and Syria was once called the land of the I O n i m, and the sea even up to the mouths of the Nile, the Ionian Sea; whiht Gaza and Antioch claimed the name of IOn, IOnah, or Jonah, after IO the representative of Meen, Minoa or Selene, 1 Bryant, III. 185. 2 Dionys.

The Dorians were Heraklidæ or worshippers of the male energy in “the deity Adorus who, by a common apheresis was expressed ’Dorus.”1 Though known only to Greeks as arrivals from Egypt, yet the race originally sprung from Kaldian Hellenes, that same Amonian or Kuthite stock from which came the Heraklidæ,2 who, Herodotus says, the herald of Xerxes told the Argives, were of the stock of “Perseus, son of Danae, and of Andromeda, daughter of Kepheus” the Aithiopian.3 The Akaimenidæ of Persis also claimed this ancestry. Under the term Pelasgians, ancient writers, though much bewildered in some cases, included Iones, Hellenes, Leleges, Argives and Arkites generally; Greeks said that Pelasgians also came from or by way of Egypt, bringing with them their rites and reli-gion, in which they instructed those amongst whom they settled; these maintained that they were the offspring of a god, Pelasgus the Arkas or Arkite, son of Poseidon—a Titanic Oceauus—and Larisa. Those of them who settled as Argives in Thessaly—the abode of Deukalion or Inachus, called it Aëria after Egypt.4 On the Phrygian coast, the great builders of Theba and Larisa in Troas, were of the same Pelasgic family though named Æolians; in Greece they were the Atika, and all the Peloponesus was once theirs, nay, says Plutarch, “the greatest part of the world,”5 meaning his “world,” and in the first century A.C., he knew a considerable part of the globe. Pelasgus, like Noah, was an early “Anthropos gēs” or husbandman, in fact he had many of the characteristics of Noah, Machus and Danaus,6 who are all fabled to have come forth from an ark or sacred cavern, herein resembling other Mithraic deities, All Arkites were great worsippers of the very ancient goddess Arne or Ar-ene, the foster-mother of Poseidon—'Arnh poseidwnoj trofoj, also called Maia Theon, Maia Dio-nusou, Tithene and Meter Theon; she was especially connected with Ar-Kal-eus of Tyre, who built Gadara or Cadiz, and was the presiding deity of the place—the Arka-El; her lord, the Ark Deus, was “the original Archus or Arcalus” from whom came all the later Arkels, Herkels, Herakles, and Herculeses.7 Eruthria (possibly Eir-uth) was clearly a demi-god or deified king of this race, for his sacred resting-place, tomb or temple, was more especially worshipped in the isle of Og-ur-is, in the deep bay of Karmania, at the entrance of the Eruthrian or Persian gulf. The special god of the Southern Skuthi was Nusos or Dio-nusos, and Kus or Chus, after whom Kaldians or rather the Chus or Chusd-im were named; he was also Pa-chus, or Bar-chus the son of Chus, and IA or I-AR-chus, meaning Dio-chus. Wherever Skuthi went they built cities to Nysus, whom Bryant, with orthodox prejudices, considers must have been Noah. We find a Nysa on the highlands of the Sindus or Indus, “in Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Colchis, upon Mount Caucasus, in Thrace, upon Helikon near Thebes, in Naxos, in Eubea, and one in Lybia, 1 Bryant, III. 385. 2 Ibid. p. 388, quoting Plato and Pausanias. 3 Herod., vii. 150.

He was famed for his wisdom and skill in astronomy, and named the Andoubarios (Indo-bar or Indi filius). He first delineated schemes of the heavens, and instructed the Indi in that science,”3 by which the narrator seems to mean that this Son of India instructed all Kuths, Akadians, and Kasdim or Kaldians; and if so, we are to understand that an Indian race was far older and more learned than even those who instructed the Shemitic races who rose to Western Empire. So Nilus. the Egyptian tells Apol-lonius that “the Indi are the wisest of all mankind; the Aithopes, a colony from them, and that they inherit the wisdom of their forefathers.” Their wise men were styled Magi and Sophitæ, and Strabo mentions an Indian province as called Sophita after them. They were described as of the Amonian faith, worshipping Sun and Fire (hence Cham-ini-Sophite already alluded to), and living as mendicants, college recluses, and in religious, societies.4 I suppose my readers are aware that Ur of Kaldia is often called Sur and Sour, the Sun, which Greeks made Kuros and Seirios; Hesychius writes “Serios ho Helios,” “By Seirios is meant the Sun;” so Syncellus tells us that Ahraham came from Sour of the Kaldians, which Egyptians made Sehor, and that the land of Suria or Syria was called after Suro, Helius, or Apollo,5 for T and S, as in Tsyria and Syria, Tsabians and Sabeans, &c., are permissible changes in various languages. It was not uncommon to confound Syria and Asyria,6 and indeed the latter only differs by giving the God Sur his active form, which the prefix A or Pi signifies. The Jew thus makes his great progenitor an Urite or Surite of the Kasds, Kasads, Kasdim7 or Kuthites of Kaldia, people who were long subsequent to these great Sumerians or Akads who claimed Sisuth-rus or Soosra (whom some fancy is Noah), as the Akadian “Founder.” Asyriologists now find from the tablets that Sisruthus means Soosra—ANU, “a primeval Man-God,” “the High One,” “the God,” and, says 1 Bryant, III. 197. The names Tri-komis and Beth-San (House of the Sun) were also given to the temple of this Triune shepherd-god. 2 Ibid., p. 217. 3 Ibid., p. 218. 4 Ibid., 219, quoting Strabo, Pliny, &c. 5 Ibid., III. 446-7.

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.—I will now summarise a portion of early history to such extent as it may be safely read, and in watching the moves of races would ask my readers to bear in mind the last philological maxim, that “whilst language is a test of social contact, it is no real test of race.” All barbarous tribes, like the early Shemites of Kaldia, of course borrowed readily from the more fixed languages of the settled pooples they came upon in their progress northward, and thus largely lost their own language; and this process goes on, more or less, with all peoples whilst in a state of flux and change, war and migration. Philologists so argue in the case of the old Basques. We are told that only the residuum of Non-Aryan words, such as are found in vocabularies of the Keltic tongues, would give us Basque or Turanian room, all else disappearing as the race drifted into the Iberian family of speech;2 and the same rule applies in mythology, religion, and morals—political and social. The following chrono-logical data—gleaned from my Chart, will, I hope, in this abstract form, refresh the reader’s memory amidst these: perplexing pre-historic times — 2300 B.C. Akadians, believed to be Turanians or Sooso-Medi, begin to lose ground in the Delta of Euphrates, owing to Shemite moves from South. 2200 ,, Turanians with Aryans on the Mediterranean coasts, and intimately blended. 2000 ,, Additional pressure from ditto, owing to Aryan movements from North to South and West. Many Kyklopian structures, as Gallery of Tiryna, Gate of Lions, Tomb of Fanaos, &c., constructed about this time. 1900 ,, Aryans and Turanians, perhaps we should say Sooso-Medians, much on the move, unable to withstand the Shemitic expansion in S.-W. Asia. 1800 ,, Very advanced races, worshipping sexual powers and symbols, moving about Europe and teaching Aborigines the arts of building, &c. 1700 ,, Shemites. now complete masters of the Delta of the Euphrates, adopt a language of their own, one much modified by Akadian. Turanians moving westwardly. 1600 ,, Kooths, Ethiopians, Pelasgi, &c., over all the coasts of Asia Minor, Hellas, Tyrrhenia (Italy), and borders of the Pontus Pelagus, or Pelasgian Sea (Mediterranean). 1500 ,, Ethipians, Kyklopians, Kabiri, Kooths, and Pelasgi, building extensively and grandly over all the shores of the Pelagian Ocean, and probably also in the far north, what we call Kyklopian structures, as the Akropolis of Alatrium (Alatri), Sipylus in Asia Minor, the baths of Aperlos in Greece, &c. 1400 ,, Aryans, with more Sabean worship than Ethiopians, Kyklops, &c., rising to power. European aborigines as Eskimos, &c., forced on or destroyed; considerable build-ing energy in progress. Ionim or Lunar Aryans settling in Panjāb.3 1200 ,, Kyklops and Skuth over all the coasts of Northern Europe, exhibiting their faith by constructing great Tors, cells, and open shrines, especially on coasts, head-lands, and prominent hills or mounds; devoted worshippers of these and of Groves, Fire, Serpent and Sun. In 11th century settling about Asia Minor. 1000 ,, By some held to be beginning of “Bronze Age,” when metaltools were tolerably common over most of Europe.

He says Aryans fully occupied Northern India in 2100 B.C. and were conquering Southern or Turanian India, having even reached Ceylon.

Kimerii and Hyperboreans forced further northwards, and pressing out older peoples. 6th C. ,, Robust Northern races, probably Kelts, Gauls, &c., begin the invasion of Southern Europe, especially of Italty. They traverse all the valleys of the Rhine and Danube, settling where they please; are well-disciplined, and with considerable knowledge of agriculture, as well as war. 5th ,, Hamilkar orders careful exploration of all the west coasts of Europe, which Phenicians oppose. Keltic bards common over Northern Europe. 4th ,, Cisalpine Gauls invade Italty and burn Rome. Rome finds all Northern and Western Europe speaking Gadhelik tongues. Kimri moving south. Thus, speaking generally, the historical order of the races and faiths seems to have been— 1. Aborigines, or earliest known races, } Weak Nomadic tribes subsisting on fruits, vegetables, milk, &c., andlater the chase, and reverencing Fetishes and Sexual Symbols. 2. Aithiopians, Kyklo-plians, Akadians, &c. } Settlers and builders, worshipping Sexual powers, the Sun and Fertility. 3. Phenicians, Kooths or Skyths, and Kelts, &c.} Do., do., but with more development of Solar worship and Tyrian Gods. 4. Iberians, Basques, Picts, Gaels, and Britons, } Tsabeans and Sivaites. Groves, Wells, Mounts, &c., worshipped. 5. Sakæ, Suavi, Saxons, Do., do., also with Groves, Holy Wells, Fire and Phallic Worship. 6. Britons, Skands, Angles, Do., do., up to 7th century A.C., except among a few of the learned. Thus up to about the 8th C. A.C. the masses of Europe still clung to their past Faiths, and Kelts, Kymri, Britons, Danes, Jutes, Teutons, Normans, &c., continued most of the old rites and customs, though they beginning to attapt a kind of Hebro-Christian Faith, which placed the Jewish Jahveh on the throne of Agni, Sol, Ermenseul or Mercury, Jove, &c., but yet discarded not wholly any of these, except in name. According to some evidence Mr Davies advances, the old Asiatic Kelts claimed an entirely Eastern origin, saying they “came from Gwlad Yr Haw called Deprobani,” a name of Ceylon and clearly pointing to an insulated Eastern home. Anyhow, in the ancestors of the above tribes we see those who brought to Europe, and especially left in our own islands, the faiths of all Central Asia of the valleys of the Oxus, Euphrates, Nile, and Danube, as well as many gross superstitions known only in the Eastern homes of those who dwelt amidst nature’s severest solitudes; these faiths would continue, but in time become milder, more reasonable and enlightened, as the tribes forsook their idle, brutish, nomadic life, and settled down into peaceful agricultural or industrial communities. Civilization was thus proceeding apace when Christianity feeling itself stronger, began, as was its wont, to practically enforce its dogmas and doctrines, espe-cially those early ones which declared Jahveh to have only “one chosen people,” and one “Holy land”; and that all who bow the knee to Baal, must be sacrificed, even to the “women and sucklings.” So we are told that the once good and mild St. Patrick —the friend of the heathen, their kings, nobles, and “innocent rites,” as he at first with pious wile declared himself—turned round when he had a goodly following, and in doing so but showed the logical results of his teaching. The persecution began by this Christian priest “seizing nine Magi and burning them alive, all in their priestly "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 201vestments of white linen.”1 Not so fast, however, did the Church as a body lose her temper, for her time and full strength had not yet come; so she condemned her saint’s act, and directed that not only were the heathen to be patted on the back, but their fes-tivals accepted, though otherwise explained away by Church traditions, interwoven with ecclesiastical tales. Neverlheless bloodshed and oppression could not now be stopped, and by the ninth century the new faith had marched to Empire up to her knees in blood, throughout every province of Central Europe, and by the next century over all Skandinavia. Max Müller tells us in regard to the Faiths of the early peoples I have mentioned that previous to the imposition over them of Christianity, “the broad outlines of the ancient religions were the same . . . . . that originally they all worshipped the same gods and that their earliest communities were not broken up, before such pregnant conceptions as ‘God,’ ‘Evil Spirit,’ ‘heaven,’ ‘sacred,’ ‘to worship,’ ‘to believe,’ had found expression;” so that all these peoples, even in Europe, were in possession of many fundamental principles and vital doctrines of Christianity, long before it was heard of; and to these the new faith probably owes its success, as well as much of what is salu-tary and vigorous. But let us continue our light chronological sketch of the moves of the European families, with special reference to Keltic lands, Britons, Anglo-Saxons, and cognate tribes, and try to locate them also chronologically. PERIOD IN NORTH BRITON AND IRELAND IN SOUTH BRITON. 3d C. B.C. Some traces of Kyklopians, with Kymri, Kelts, Norsemen, Skands, &c. Remnants of Kyklops and Pheni-cians, Sakæ, Britons. 2d C. B.C.

The tribes of our Islands much the same as in last century, and quiet; Rome ruling all now with a firm grasp, from Land’s End to the Forth, except Wales and Lake Districts. 2d and 3d C. A.C. No change of any importance, owing to a firm Roman rule and internal disputes of classes, clans and sects.

Prince Arthur, called son of above by the wife of a Cornish or Kymrik princes, succeeds; institutes military order of “Knights of the Round Table.” Britons try to regain powr but fail. Christianity but partially known. King Arthur dies, having established Christianity in York. ST. COLUMBA, or the Saint of Ioan or I-colm-kil, a somewhat mythical character, like St. Patrick, said by Bebe to land in Scotland, perform many miracles, and make converts.

St. Kentigern or Mungo preaches. “Britons, calling themselves Kymri” (Blair), retire to Wales and north-west coasts. South Britain may now be called Kingdom of Angles and Saxons. Augustine and monks arrive in Kent to convert it to Christianity. Augustine goes to Arles, and is ordained BISHOP OF THE ANGLES. Few Christians ex-cept about Kent; wooden churches of Canterbury and St. Paul’s built. ST.

Mr. Wil-loughby Rosse1 says that ancient Britons, when driven out north and west by conquer-ing Saxons, called themselves Kymri (our Welshmen), and formed a league with all the old races along the west of England, from Cornwall to the Clyde, a statement, like some others, requiring a good deal of explanation, for these modern Kymri were a totally different people to the Kymri who dominated near the Hyperboreans, as seen in my small map on Pl. II. at the beginning of this volume, and these again from the Basque-like races who preceded all Kelts.2 The later Kelts were as different from the Indo-Germanic and early high Asian races, as Pelasgians were from Latins. Cesar did not discriminate between Gaels, Gauls, or Galli, probably so called after the priests of Kubele, who were Galli; Phrygians called a holy river, Gallus, saying it was sacred to Kubele, and she was a deeply revered goddess in our northern Isles. The later diluted or commixed Kymri of Wales, Jutland, Ilyria, and the Crimea, are all called Kelts, and it is hard to say in what part of Northern Germany, Bohemia, Bavaria, &c., these bold warriors did not more or less settle. Northern Italy used to be called Cis-Alpine Gaul, and the home of the Lombards used to be in Southern Denmark, and we are justi-fied in calling Umbrians, Isumbrians, Ligurians, &c., Keltic. or Gaulish races, and in therefore seeking for Keltic faith and its linguistic roots in all these tongues. The foregoing tables must have shown my readers that facts disprove the popu-larly accepted idea as to the age of Christianity in central and northern Europe, and I will now show by the movements of races who succeeded, and have mostly swallowed up Kelts, what a very tedious and unsatisfactory process, the conversion of Europe to Christianity has been, and for what a short time this faith has existed, when we compare it with other great old faiths. As yet it has only had a trial of some eight to ten centuries, and this by no menas in every part of Europe, as what I have else-where advanced regarding the grosser forms of Serpent, Stone, Solar, and even Grove, Well, or Tree worship has clearly substantiated. We must remember in reading ecclesiastical history, that when a Duke, as he of Northumberland, Poland, Normandy, &c., is converted, that this in no sense applies to all his people, though these very often were, at least outwardly, as docile as the herds on the dukal pastures. It takes at least two or three generations to convert the upper classes, and treble this before the mou inert and superstitious masses will forsake the old for a new idea. Some think that ten centuries is too long a period to assign to any faith amongst intelligent, inquiring, and reasonable, peoples; urging, that five to six centuries is about as long as most dogmas and doctrines founded on quasi-historical matters can last, where the light is constant, and often very strong. If this be so, the Protestantism of Luther and Calvin may be of short duration, but not necessarily so the more 1 Blair’s Chron. Tables, 1856, p. 240. 2 Skene’s His. of Anc. Alban.

She builds on many prominent weaknessess of the unreasonable or illiterate masses, which only education and general advancing intelligence can undermine, at least with permanent effect. The following vast migrations of people, moving though they did about Europe from the dawn of Christianity, and bringing with them all their Eastern superstitions, yet hastened civilisation and learning, by preventing the stagnation of these, and this in spite of the persistent efforts of Christian teachers to the contrary. In 253 A.C. the Visigoths, whose supposed home was to the north and east of the Black Sea, descended upon Greece by land and water, while Kelts or Galli, under Brenus and others, ravaged Europe. In 378 Visigoths encountered the pernecuting Emperor, Flavius Valens, destroyed his army and burned him in his tent. They then passed south into the Morea, and back north by the Dalmatian coast; twice they traversed all the fertile plains of Lombardy, and then marched to nearly the very toe of Italy and back, reaching Savoy about 412, where they probably met the Baltic SUEVES, who must have been then on their return from Florence, which they set out to plunder in 409. The Visigoths on leaving the shores of the Gulf of Genoa struck north as far as Clermont, and then went south to Narbonne, entering Spain by Barcelona about 419; where they settled, driving out their brother Alans, and another batch of Northern Sueves, who had accompanied the Vandals into the Peninsula about eight or nine years previously. These Visigoths greatly extended Spanish rule, and remained in Spain till ejected about 712 by the Moors. In 370 A.C., the Huns—a great and fierce tribe from Eastem and Central High Asia—moved westward, settling in batches as they went, until they reached the fertile valleys of the Volga, the Don, and their affluents, when they turned back to Central Asia. Some went as far as the Carpathians, and the general result of their devastating sweep was, that they moved hosts of other powerful tribes such as the Alans, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths, marking a great epoch in the world’s history. It was owing to the Huns that the Visigoths moved off south and west in 377, the Alans in 407, and the Ostrogoths in 453. Attila ruled over the Huns from 434 to 453 A.C.; and it was under his youngest son, Ir-nak (a name denoting a Pytho-Solar faith), that the vast hosts of Huns and several other warlike and fierce tribes returned to Asia in 455, after devastating Central Europe. It was in 445 that Attila (Greek spelling; German, Etzel; Hungarian, Ethele) moved down on the Eastern Roman Empire, between the Euxine and the Adriatic, and demanded and received a large extent of territory south of the Danube, and tribute from other states. In 450 he again started, but this time passed through Sarmatia and ermany to as far west as Orleans, thence returning east to Strasburg; in 451 traversing all the present Austrian Empire and crossing the Alps, he proceeded down Western Italy to Rome, but he spared it at the solicitation, says the Church, of St. Peter, and returned by Eastern Italty to his place on the Danube, where he died in 453.

Some writers give 406 as the year in which the Alani and Vandals reached Spain. The Vandals or North Germans, inhabiting the southern shores of the Baltic, west of the Vistula, left their home in 409 A.C., in two divisions, one south for Florence—which was joined by their neighbours the Sueves on the Danube—and one west for the Moselle country, which the Alans joined on the Rhine, when it took the route just described into Spain, where the races settled down in 406, and eventually founded a powerfu1 kingdom of Vandals, now called Andal-usia. In 428-9 the Vandals, under King Genseric, swept all through Europe, and along the north African coast. They conquered all the Roman territories, and in 435 made Carthage, though in ruins, their African capital. Carnage and spoliation ever marked their steps, and in 455, they plundered Rome, although Attila and his Huns had mercifully spared it only a few years previously. They seized Sardinia and Corsica, and annexed the Baleares Islands, which they ruled from Carthage-Nova in South-east Spain. This is by some held to he the end of the “IRON AGE” but not yet the end of that period of great wars and emigrations from Asia. to Europe, and of a general Western tendency. In 534 the Vandals lost nearly all their conquests to the able general of the Emperor Justinian—Belisarius the Ilyrian—whose untiring energy in the destruction of all Goths, Kelti, etc., made up for his master’s incapacity for war. In 420 A.C. occurred another small, but to us very important move from east to west—the invasion of Armorika and the Breton race, by a flight of Franks, Franci, or “Free Men” from Northern Germany. This race, which is first heard of in history about 240 A.C., appear to have moved into Gaul about 420 having been constantly disturbed in the North-East by other races sweeping over them. They rose to power and then to kingdom under Clovis son of Childrik, in 496, and he, owing to priestly influence first brought to bear upon his queen Clotilda, embraced the rising faith, though in name only. Clovis was shrewd enough to see that only as a Christian monarchy could his kingdom descend in peace to his posterity. Personally he was brave and is said to have killed the Gothic king, Alarik, with his own hand. He died 511 A.C. When the Frans were advancing on Gaul, the race to the north of them—the Saxons—were also advancing westwards, and crossing in great numbers to England or South Britain, inhabited by those they called the Bryttiak. In 448 A.C., the provinces of Kent, Sussex, and Wessex began to be crowded with the invaders, who at first welcomed them as their deliverers from Kelts and other hardy Northern races. Here the Saxons found a new and soon a much-loved home. ALANS —— 407 A.C. 409 A.C 419 A.C. VANDALS —— 409 A.C. . 429 A.C. 435 A.C. 455 A.C. 534 A.C. FRANKS or FRANCI. —— 420 A.C. 240 A.C 496 A.C.

In 547 those Angles who were still northern neighbours of the Saxons in South Denmark, moved also eastward to protect Central and Northem England from Picts and Scots, and by the end of the 5th century they had there firmly established them-selves, and thenceforth ruled with their Saxon brothern until a British king—Edward the Confessor, Norman by education—managed to re-establish the old dynasty some 500 years after, or in 1042. On Edward’s death in 1066, his Norman friend, William the Conqueror, landed at Hastings, and Normans, Saxons, and Angles—still called British—have ever since governed these Islands, though the crown has been borne by those of French and Teutonic lineage. In 453 A.C. the Ostro-Goths—a valiant race dwelling about that Kymerian land and sea known as Asoph, Azov, or Asia, and whom we may call the Kymerian dwellers between the lower Don and Dneiper—disturbed as I have shown by Huns and Alans, set out for the western vales of the Danube and the mountainous ranges of Panonia, and finally settled there in 493, as masters of all the eastern shores of the Northern Adriatic 38 well as much of Etrurian Italy. In 568 A.C., the Longo-bards or Lombards—a northern race whose home had lain between the Saxons and Vandals on the east bank of the lower Elbe, started on “the war path;” and, driving the Gepidæ out of the northern valleys of the Danube—our Hungary—dwelt there till 774, when the Saracen invasion enabled them to remove further west into the fertile hills and meads of the Po and its affluents. Thus we find that, owing to Asiatic influences, all was motion and progress of a kind—an entire absence of stagnation, from the 3d century A.C. till near the end of the 6th, when sundry European peoples disturbed by Christian proselytism and writhing under the destruction of their old faiths, adopted a similar rôle, nor could be got to settle down as fixed nationalities, for two or three centuries later. In the 8th century the Saracens began driving all Christians out of Western Asia and Northern Africa, and rapidly established the religion of the Crescent over all the once very Chris-tian “Western Empire,” and thus was lost all the labour and theology which had for 500 years been here building up churches and doctrines; these crumbled away in a few years, and, but for Charles Martel and his valiant band in Central France, all Southern Europe might have this day been a land of Islāmis. I say Southern Europe, for the brave Norman or North Men—the honoured ancestors of our mixed English race, were then fast rising in power, and not likely to yield to any Southern foe whomsoever, especially to an alien and Shemitic Kālif. A Ruric Norman founded the Russian Empire at the close of the 9th century, (862), and every northern kingdom bent before this intrepid race; they introduced an a age of chivalry, and lent their swords for two or three centuries to every monarch of Europe, emblazoning Norman scutcheons with great names and brilliant deeds.

The Saxons are doubtless those Sakæ or Skuths who stopped Cyrus in his proud career, and gave the name of Sakasoni to a large tract of Armenia. Their path Westward is traced through Dacia, Bohemia, and Saxony, to England, but many say that their earliest route was not by the difficult rivers and black forests of Austria and Germany, and amongst their fierce wild denizens, but by the sunny and open lands of Africa, through which they reached Spain by the pillars of Hercules. From the Pyrenees they are held to have divided, one branch proceeding northwards, the other forcing its way eastwards down into Italy. Pliny called the Armenian race Sar-Kos-ani, which thus divided, may signified “Koothites of the Solar fount;” but Ptolmey called them Saxones, which may possibly be a contraction of the former. The German Suavi are mentioned by Tacitus as worshippers of Isis, retaining many Egyptian practices, and measuring time like most Shemites. The Welsh have also many traditions, nay, much history, regarding their Eastern origin. It is then established that many mere “trans-Pontian,” as well as centra1 Asiatic hordes—devout adherents of all Eastern faiths, ever and again knocked at the Eastern gates of Europe, and had to be freely admitted, and that by the direct teaching of Asia as well as later by infiltration through Greece and Italy, all Europe was induced to abate its grosser forms of fetish and nature worship, and to incorporate therewith Serpent and Fire, and lastly Solar and Planetary faiths with their varied rites and symbolisms. The cradles or nurseries of European faiths were therefore Asiatic Skythia, Sarmatia, Sogdiana, Bactria, and India, which poured into the West as they had previously done into Kaldia, a highly intelligent, bright-eyed, but somewhat puny race, of Turanian type, one which had ripened long before the strongest fair-haired, light-eyed, stalwart Aryans, who, in later times, covered the same ground and forced their way through and settled as they listed, on the lands of weaker peoples; these too had, in turn, to succumb in the South before the equally robust Shemites. It was doubtless the Turanians who brought to cold northern Europe those figures of Oriental flowers and animals, as the pomegranate, lotus, monkey, elephant, lion, and unicorn, as well as Maha-Deva and his rites; we find the same from furthest Asia to furthest America, and not only so, but often similar names and words for these, which assure us that philology must not insist too much on the entire separation of languages, and that there are yet many difficult problems to solve in regard to the nature of this connection, as well as the religious affinities; matters not yet adequately touched upon. There is very little essential difference in the early ideas and technical language of faiths from Japan to Britain. Everywhere the idea has been to worship the mighty Spirit, manifest to the senses through the wonderful phenomena of Creation, Fire, Thunder, Sun, &c., and the names of these before the days of writing, appear to have been nearly identical, and the religious Rites and “Holy Places” very similar. It was usual for the earliest worshippers of elemental nature, to offer their praises,"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 209prayers, and sacrifices in the open air, or within an unroofed enclosure, the only per-missible covering being the sacred tree. The roofless Milesian temple of the Didymean Apollo, in a magnificent grove and sacred enclosure, is a good sample of such, and so was many a Kirk, or Klachan, and scores of similar shrines existed all over Europe up to the days of Charlemagne; indeed the geographical linits of these, are those of the globe itself, for from Central America to China and her isles, and all over India, on the Highlands and plains of the Oxus, Armenia, or Iran, over Media, Persia, Circassia or Kasakia, Syria, and all the coasts of ancient Greece, and Etruskan Italy, did they abound. Africa, from the Thebaid mountains and Amonium fount in the Lybian desert, to away west over every part of her Northern shore tells the same tale, whilst the Sierra of Spain but above all her Phens (Fins), those Sivaites of Fin-is-terre revelled in a profusion of such fanes. Nor was ancient Lusitania neglectful of open-air shrines, or Keltic circles, saying that these radiated from that great Phenician centre Tartessus and its powerful island city, Gadir, which Pliny affirms was the original seat of both the Keltici and Kelt-Iberians. Gaul, especially in Keltika and its Northern division Armorika, vies with our own islands in magnificent remains of these stern old worshippers, and we must now carefully consider some details in regard to these, beginning with the early Irish, who seem to have retained more of their Hyperborean, nay, Kyklopian and early Kymrian blood and customs, than others; they still rejoice in the Phenian (Fenian) name, as they not unfrequently do in certain Fenian habits.1 ANCIENT IRISH PHENIClANS, &c.—The Carthagenians were called Peni or Pheni, and the Irish Kelts Feinné, Fianaidhe, Fenii, or Fenians; of which the base Beni, a son, dart or serpent, is lost in Pi, hence Pri, Pen, and Pin, which Kelts make Prin or Phryn, and so Phrygians, Pri-Ap, and Priapians, &c. In Keltish, Fiené, is a “warrior,” “husbandman,” or “great man,” equivalent to the Akadian radical Pi-En, “the One Pi” —“Sole God,” or Maha-Deva. The Reverend Mr Smiddy forces upon us the conclu-sion that the term Scot, is from the same source; he says Scuit is Sciot, “an arrow or dart,” and that therefore “Sciot and Fiené would mean the same thing, that is, a person expert in hurling a dart,” and certainly these races have proved thus skilful in more ways that one. The word Kelt may. it is thought, come from Geilt, “a wild man of the woods” (in Sanskrit an Arayana), or Coiltach, an inhabitant of woods, their priests were Draoi, pronounced Dhree; and said to signify “wise (Ai) men of the Oak”—Dair.2 “In Ireland these ancients were called Tuatha-De-Danan, that is the princes (Tuath) or descendants of Dia-tene-Ion (‘God the fire-god,’) by which was meant the Sun.” Now as “Ceal (pro-nounced Kal) means the heavens,” we see clearly enough that Coiltach or Cealtach, that is Kal-tach,3 meant simply “followers of Kal” or Sivaites. The Irish, it appears, always correctly call themselves Gaoidhiel, a word which this author says he cannot adequately convey the pronunciation of in English letters, but which is formed of 1 [When this was written “Fenian” possibly did not have the political connotation it now does. — T.S.] 2 Druids, Anc. Churches and Round Towers of Ire., by Rev. R. Smiddy, p. 2-4. Kelly, Dub. 1873. 3 Kal or Cal signifies also to encircle, hence Kuklos and Circulus of Greek and Latins, our circle, and the Scotch Kirk or Cui-erc, which this author says is “the house of heaven.”"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 210“Gaol, ‘a relative,’ and Ceallagh, a person of the heavens;” in India we would ex-press this, as “a person holding the faith of Kāla.” The old derivation of Keltæ, from Celsus (Kelsus), who came from Cœlus (Kelus) or Uranus, that is from “Ur the Sun, and An, man,” is therefore, thinks the Reverend author, the root of this matter.1 The term Goth may be a corruption or inflection of Scuit or Get, anciently Getæ, the Skyths—often called the “Fiery Kelts,” either from their nature or worship. This author is another of those learned writers who insist that “the Keltic language forms the chief root of the Greek and Latin tongues;” he says the ancient Irish lan-guage is correctly described as that which Kadmus found in Phenicia with only sixteen letters.2 The great Keltic God Beal, or Be-All, he identifies with the universal “I Am;” for Be, signifies “Is,” and All “universal,” that is the Alla of Arabia, the root of which lay in Alat, the Phallus. Cesar confirms this, saying3 that “Mercury is the first God of these Kelts,” and so the Irish call Hermes, Dia-Cead-ion (eeon), “God the first Lord”—“the guide in the path,” and aid in all things—he, said Tacitus, to whom Germans offer human sacrifices,4 and dedicate Wednesday. The Irish language shows us how Diana is connected with Day, for Dia (Deus or Theos) is at once a “god” and “a day,” and “I-On, pronounced Eeon, is a ‘high lord,’ and sometimes God or the Sun,” for he is truly the I or “pillar ON.” So Venus’ day—Friday—is called “Dia-Ven-Ione,” corrupted into Dia-aione or Dianine, “the day of the Woman God,” for Bean or Ben is Woman, and Ven-Ion is “Woman high, lady,” but generally applied to one of a licentious disposition, as were most Venuses.5 This certainly takes us to a Keltik root of Venus, and hence to the root-symbol of Ben, Ven, Fen, or -’En, which is clearly Pi, and In—“the abyss,” “well,” “womb or source of fertility,” that is “the dual God” of both organs. As in Dia, Di, De, or Da, we see T, Tau, Ta, Thah, Jah, and Yah, so in this Solar God we see “the Great I AM of the Hebrew; for Ta means AM or IS”6 says this clergyman, thereby confessing to the Jewish God being Siva, which the Hebrew De, hd, “to drive,” or “hunt,” points to, for all Sivas and Nimrods are “drivers” or hunters. Ta is the root of Tues-day, as well of Thor or Thur—“the driving god” of the hammer, in which Ur, is Fire or Lightning. So Ar-Thur, or Ar-Ta-Ur, may be AR, the Sun or “Lord,” and Th-Ur, Fire in its energizing form. Friday, continues Mr. Smiddy, comes from Fear or Fr, “man;” i, “she,” the Uith, or “udder,” and Ta, “god,” that is, the “Woman, or udder god.” As Uith is pronounced oo or U, we thus, he thinks, see that the Latin Mulier and English Wo-man or Oo-man is formed from Uith, “udder,” and An, man; Mulier from Uith and fe-ar, man; so “Vir, Man of the Latin, comes from fear, Man of the Keltic.”7 The Astarte of Greece, as well as Ishtar of the early and later cuniform Kaldi writers, is represented in the Esus, Esar, or Estar whom Romans found Kelts and Teutons worshipping; and 1 Op.

As a rule, all early peoples had some name denoting their faith or principal god, thus Teutons were called after Teutate or Mercury, who was the god of commerce, and his Keltic name—Ta-Taith-cean-nach, correctly signified this. From the early races we appear to have our term for the holiest spot in the Team-pul, the Altar. The old Irish and Welsh for this is Alloir, Allor, or Allawr, where Al is “a stone,” and Iau or Ior, God;2 again pointing to Alat the Arabic Phallus, and to the “Pillar of the Temple”—that holy place on which oaths were made; our ancestors when in trouble ever strove to touch “the altar stone,” when all ills were alleviated, and none might harm the toucher. “Adoration,” as already pointed out, was “to speak intensely to God,” for adh signifies “intensity,” and radh, rah, or rase, “speaking;” hence Ad-raw, “adore,” and adoro. From the same source comes Arē, prayers in Greek, and Ara, the altar or place of prayer, for Al is God, and Alt, the “high” One or “high place”—variants of Art, Ar or As, names for “God” and the Sun as well as “a stone.” These old words give us the clue to many Asiatic, Greek and Latin words, as Ari, Asi, Artamis, Art-a-Xerxes, Ars-akes, &c., as well probably as Ag or Agni, the God of Fire, for the Alt, or Art, were the special Druidik and Kymrik gods, whom they tried to propitiate on their Alt-oir stones, by “Offrails, Sacrails, or Iomailt,”3 which later peoples called offerings, sacrifies, and immolations. In Keltic Alt-oir, was the “high place” or “high altar,” of God, and “a stone of adoration” was a cloch-adhoradh, abreviated cloch-ar, whilst the “Sun stone,” or “a stone bending forward,” was a crom-cloch, crom-lech, or crom-leacht. The Rev. Mr. Smiddy translates these words as the “bending forward” or “rocking stone”4 rather than “Sun-stone;” and this is probable, for reasons however, not anticipated by our author, viz., certain peculiarities of the Phallic deity, which led ancient men to imagine he was actuated by a life or Spirit independent of that of the animal in which he lived. Ireland, it appears “is the only country of the Western Church was has a pecu-liar name of its own for the mass.”5 It rejects missa, messe, &c., and calls it Afrionn-de, which, says Smiddy, comes from the pure Keltic roots, a, “very,” fior “true,” uan “lamb,” and De “God,” that is, “the very true lamb of God,” which it is thought John i. 29, &c., suggested! The words may have been retained from their having been formed into an oath, for all were early taught to swear “by the Holy Sacrament. . . . .

He thinks “that the stone crosses erected by the early Christians in their market-places were intended for a similar purpose,” and that “some of the Dhallaums (it seems hopeless to change the execrable orthography adopted for these old tongues, by writers who try to spell as they hear rustics persist in drawling out and mispro-nouncing their words) have had rude crosses inscribed on them apparently with this object.” “Dallans are found in all countries formerly held by Kelts,” and in France, where they are probably moat abundant, they are called Dolmans. Dallan enters into many words, as Dalmany and Clunmany—names given to the sacred spots where these holy objects stood. Such terms are contractions, says our author, for Dal-na-mionna, “the god-stone of oaths,” and Cluain-na-mionna,—the circumvallated place of the oaths,” such as Samuel went up to circumambulate,—a custom which Arabians and Indians continue to this hour. Even now the Irish are commonly heard to swear, Dar angcloch seo, “by this stone;” if intending to be very solemn, a “good Catholic” Kelt will aver, Dar an leac Phadric ata a Geasial, “by the stone of St. Patrik that is at Cashel,” as the Roman asseverated, “per Jovem lapidem.”2 As the ancient Kelts also kissed these sacred stones, whether ovate or obeliskal, fancying they would make them “polite, truthful, and fascinating for ever,”3 so Chris-tians carried on this rite, kissing crosses, altars, and lattery the Bible. In Asia as well as Europe, Dalans are often in pairs, and where feminine, that is with natural or artificial perfora-tions, as in Figs. 1, 2, and 5 of this Pl. XI., persons vowing or entering into engagements were required to grasp or touch hands through the aperture or IOne, which object, it will be seen, was not forgot in the ark or altar-piece of the phallic deity of the Roman Nympheum already alluded to at p. 369, Vol. I. Over this Ark of Life with its sleepless Eye, as well as beside it, stands the Tsur Oulamin or “Rock of Ages,”4 he whom the ancient Kelts called the Tar-fealdh, “Pillar Bull, or Father of generation;” for, says General Vallency, in his Dic. of Anc. Irish (p. 39), “Tarabh or Turbh a bull, in Irish, signified the AB or father (that is “the holder” or possessor) of Tar; genera- tion in Chaldee is, ba-rht, from whence rwt, taurus.” 1 Druids, p. 38. 2 Ibid., pp. 39-40. 3 Ibid., p. 40, as “the Blarney Stone.” 4 Isaiah xxvi. 4."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 213The lrish had “a Navel” or central part of their whole world, just as the Gonds of Central India and the heritage of Delphi had. It was on the boundaries of Meath where five provinces met and was called Uis Neach, and here, said tradition, “the first sacred fire was lighted . . . by the Arch-Druid named Midhe; and on this hill a large stone called Ail-na-mireann, that is the stone of the parts.” All sentences here pro-nounced were final, and whoever rejected them was excommunicated from society and all offices and religious rites. A.n oath or decision granted to a child of the faith here, was as solemn as that which bound the Jew when swearing on the Patriarchal “thigh.” Mr Smiddy points out also a similarity between the early Keltic and Jewish fanes; “they bear no evidonce of the operation of the hammer and chisel,” but were “heaven-formed” like those of Sinai, that is, of stones which this religious people “found lying on the plains;” Kelts had no god of Sinai to teach and instruct them. History plainly, and apparently with truth, assures us that the sacred Lia-fail was brought to the Mount of Tara from Iberian Spain, where it was probably quarried in the usual mundane fashion by Basques (B’As-Akes) or their predecessors. The Irish like Jews, were very particular on the subjeet of Batons, Rods, Sticks, or Croziers. They had a “staff of Jesus” or Bachall Josa, held to have come from Christ himself, and an English priest of the twelfth eentury, who went to Ireland with King John, wrote that it was “the most remarkable and venerable relic in Erin . . . Its origin,” he adds, “may be doubtful, but not so its virtue”! St Patrick, it appears, got it from an old woman, who said “she received the staff from Christ himself, for when he was upon earth he visited this island”—an unknown one on which St Patrick and his companions were wrecked on their way to Gaedhil or Erin. The old woman added, in giving it, that she and hers would live childless till the day of judgment, showing that it was held to have to do with procreation. The staff was always retained by St. Patrick, and was finally deposited, like the rod of Moses, in a costly ark or case, and “on it, covenants were ratified and solemn oaths made. It was for ages the badge of the successors of St. Patrick in the See of Armagh,” and was brought in 1180 to the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Dublin, but in 1538 was burnt by the agents of Henry VIII.1 Strange that no peoples have been without their Jupiter Lapis, or “the Pillar of the Sanctuary,” thus showing how closely connected these symbols are with “the Rock of our Salvation”—the old obelisk, and later rods of Egyptian and other Priests, which symbolised the pillar or obelisk. See the Crozier of Cashel, and various Rods and Batons which I have already treated of at pages 252, 253 of Vol. I. The CROM-CRUCH of Ireland—“the Red or Bloody Crom,” “the chief idol of Erin, which atood in Magh-Slecht,” or “the Plain of Adoration,” was an idol which greatly perplexed St. Patrick. It “was a huge image or emblem of the sun . . . . ornamented with gold and silver, and having twelve other idols omamented with brass around him . . . St Patrick assailed him with his wonder-working crozier,” and 1 All the forgoing will be found in Rev. R. Smiddy’s Work, p. 273, et seq."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 214the idol and his satellites were swallowed up by the earth.1 This is a case, not unusual, of one god eating up another; and in his form as Cen Cruaich or “Tool of Erin,” surrounded by Zodiacal signs, we see that Crom is the Argha Nāt in his destructive or November form; for Cen becomes specially red and bloody in the Samh Ain or winter “Circle of the Sun,”—the first days of November, when the spirits of the departed only can be worshipped: at this period the ancient Irish used to sacrifice both horses and human beings to the decreasing orb of say.2 It is a curious fact that the god’s name, Crom, means a maggot, thus making Crom-Cruach, “the red bloody Maggot” (Rev. author, p. 108); and we have already seen that the great god of the; Zulus is also “a fleshy maggot,” and that the Jewish and Christian deities were symbolised in the Basar or “Flesh” which was circum-cised,3 which “Flesh,” under the Greek term Sarx, became the “Logos” or “Word.” Our Reverend author here urges that “the God of Akaron” or Beel-Zebub, though meaning, it is thought, “the god of flies,” may be “the maggot God,” inasmuch as “the maggot is an incipient or embryo fly, and we are told that in ancient Egypt a blue-bottle fly received divine honours;” so that Crom-Cruch, “the red and bloody maggot,” is closely connected with Be-al-Zebub, Satan, Abadon or Apollyon, Priapus, or the Bazar, “the Flesh,” and Lop. Even though we do not accept all this, the mag- got or worm-idea is a fact, and we can clearly see the nucleus of it in the ever-preva-lent notion as to Generation, being Destruction and Siva the Destroyer, being also “him who maketh alive.” The immediate creation of new life ont of the dead, was and is a subject constantly dwelt upon by those races who believe in everlasting trans-migration, and such subjects had none of the horrors which Christians attach to them. Asiatics seem to have been prophets in this matter of “the God of Destruction being also the God of Life.” Professor Huxley tells us that “Physiology writes over the portals of Life, “DEBEMUR MORI NOS NOSTRAQUE,’ with a profounder meaning than the Roman attached to that melancholy line;” he adds: “Under whatever disguise it takes refuge, whether fungus or oak, worm or man, the living protoplasm not only ultimately dies and is resolved into its minerals aud lifeless constituents. but is always dying, and, strange as the paradox may seem. could not live unless it died. . . . All work implies waste, and the work of life results, directly or indirectly, in the waste of protoplasm.”4 But to continue. A church in Ireland was anciently called Ceall—pronounced Ka-ail—in which Ca or Cai is “a house,” and il or ail “a stone,” or rock,5 equivalent to the Jewish Bet El, Tsur, or Rock-God, the Keltic Al-toir or altar stone, which healed. and pro-tected as before said, all who boldly essayed to touch it, and to Samuel’s Ebenezer, or “Stone of Help,” which Bel or Be-al meant with Kelts—Al being God, and Be or Beos, life. It has been already pointed out6 that Caill is in Gaelic the male organs 1 Rev. R. Smiddy’s Druids, p. 107. 2 All Soul’s Day. Smiddy, p. 106. 3 Gen. xvii. 11.

One Irish term for a church is Daimhliag,2 which we are told is also “House of the StonE,” from Dom, a house, and Leac, a stone—not because in later days such places were built of. stone, but from the sacred leac within. Another old name for a church was Domhnac, or more correctly Domhtach, which is reducable by the omission of the usual redundant h, and remembering that ch is a mere breath, to Dom-ta, or “house of Ta or Toth,” equi-valent to Cathach—that is Ka-ta, the celebrated “House of God,” in which a copy of the Jewish Psalms has been kept, says the Rev. Mr Smiddy, from about the time of the very mythical Saint Columba. The Irish also called their churches “the House of the Dove,” (colum-ceal or kolum-kil) as well as the “house of the Basilisk.”3 And just as the Eduth merged, into, or was lost or forgotten in its casing, the ark,—and this in the later glories of the Temple of Solomon,—and quite dropped out of sight in that of Zerubbabel and Herod, so the sacred Lingam of Meka has been forgotten in the Al-Kaba and the IOne and Basilisk in the Irish Domtach. The Rev. Father Smiddy writes:—“It was usual to give the name of church, or house of God, to an ancient case containing relics; so also the name apse or chancel was given to a reliquary,” because for relics, etc., a Ceal or Cella was built. If the church was dedicated to the male relic, then Ceal or Kil-Ta would be a suitable name, and Colum-kil, if the female goddess was meant; for Ta and Kol or Colum stood for IOn and IOni. This welding and disintegrating process has not yet ceased, though the apse, altar, and reliquary casket have fallen into desuetude with small bodies of Presbyterians, Methodists, &c., who assert that their God is now only “spiritually discerned.” In olden days however, it was not so; the whole shrine symbolized the deity, and the mariner asked to see him as a great protecting Pur-Tor on dangerous headlands, as did the landsman on such holy Zion mounts as Tara, Silbury, &c., but in process of time, priests hid the god away out of sight in a recess of his symbolic fabric, substitut-ing it and themselves, until the deity was forgotten in the shrine and ecclesiastic. Thus in the case of the old Irish structures and their gods, the very raison d’être of the towers is disputed, and many have asserted that they were constructed for every purpose but the real one, some doing so, because unable to conceive such supposed debasement. No explanations, however, save those given by Marcus Keane, and the authors on this side who preceded him and enabled him to speak so plainly, have been satisfactory—least of all have those of the reverend gentleman who has here been otherwise of so much use. His small volume must, nevertheless, be of the utmost value to all 1 Smiddy, pp. 158, 159. 2 Ibid., p. 160. 3 Ibid., pp. 155, 178; quoting Clement of Rome, Isidore, Tertuillian, &c.

Mr Smiddy, as an Irish antiquary, assures us that all the old Irish towers (which he thinks were baptistries!) had a deep well or lower compartment covered in, usually, he thinks, with wood, but in the Keneigh Tower, with “large flag-stones; inserted in the side walls, and extending from them, so as to cover the whole space over the lowest compartment, leaving, however, a hole or opening in the centre of the floor, about three feet in diameter.”2 This forcibly reminds us of some Indian Lingam shrines, where devotees may look down upon their loved idol—the lower and most sacred symbol, see Fig. 4, p. 39, Vol. I.; it may be raised through this orifice for the adoration of the faithful. Dr. Petrie and others remark with astonishment at there being no windows to any of the lower compartments. Had he seen the lower crypts into which I have, in privileged stealth, crawled and groped my way in India, midst filth and darkness, he would not have here written as he has. Of these Irish towers only some eighty remain, though from 120 to 130 have been counted, varying in height from 50 to 140 feet, and in diameter at base from 12 to 20 feet. They taper slightly, and invariably have a conical head of from 10 to 20 feet, springing sometimes from a slightly projecting ring. Out of the apex, say some, sprang a stone cross, which, however phallicly significant, is not very probable; there should be here a representation of flame, like that shown on the Egyptian obelisks,3 which the old worshippers were well acquainted with. High up under the cap ring were usually four windows, facing the cardinal points. The entrance door was always several feet from the ground, just as we see in the case of Eastern fire temples, the Al-Kaba of Meka, the so-called tomb of Cyrus, etc.4 The door, if not window jambs, is usually in the Egyptian sloping form. In the lowest compartment have generally been found ashes and charcoal,5 which would seem to denote that the Fid-Neamf or Lingam had been of wood, like the Ligneus Penis of the Latins, and been burnt. Most of the fires of the Pur-tor would also be of oiled wood or pine torches, which the followers of Bacchus were so fond of. They have windows towards the four cardinal points, say Christians who claim the towers as their own, “because four is a Christian mystic number”! thus Matthew6 says the elect are to be gathered “from the four winds”; the world is said to have four parts; the priest at Easter used to first throw water from the sacred font to these four quarters, so the head of the person who is being baptised should be first 1 Leibnitz wrote—“For the better elucidation of Celtic literature, I consider a diligent study of the Irish language to be of great importance. . . .

Cit., p. 212. 3 See that of Mars, Vol. I., 133.

This is doubtless a phase of Solo-Hebraic faith and such as these towers were associated with, just as was Solomon’s temple, for he made three of the twelve supporters of his molten sea of holy water, look towards each of the cardinal points.2 So Christians said baptism denoted the Illuminati, and that the Jew, John the baptizer, was the “Lucerna ardens et lucens.”3 The old and the modern faith prescribed that whoso-ever was baptised must take a burning candle in his hand and walk forth before the church,4 and in Ireland these round towers were always in the traditions of the people connected with fire. The people of Kilkenny call their round tower, Lampa na Eire-ann or “the lamp of Ireland,” and Dr. Petrie says that th etower of St. Columbanus in Burgandy was called a Lucerna, “light” or “lantern” as we might expect, for St. Columbanus was an Irishman, and he settled there in the sixth century.5 DRUIDS.—The Druidic faith was younger than that which led up to phallic towers and fire, though it had so welded in the rites of its Solar circles, with fire, bloody sacrifices, and columns, that it is difficult to draw the line; yet I feel satisfied that Druidism was a Keltic Solo-Fire faith, of course with some phallic proclivities, yet in advance of the Kyklopian and Phenician early rites. The Druid priest or instructor of the ancient Britons was called, according to the execrable spelling of the times, Cwyz or Gwydd; the superior high priest was the Dar-Gwyd, and the inferior the Go-wydd; thus the former came to be called the Der-wyd or Druid, and the latter the Owyd or Sywyd, as named by the bards Taliesin and Aneurin of the fifth or sixth century A.C.6 Sywyd or Saiyid is no doubt the root of the Arabic title Seyid—a leader of the faith. The three first principles of Druids were, “To worship the gods; to do no evil, and to exercise fortitude”7—otherwise given: “Obey the laws of God; concern thyself for the good of mankind, and bravely sustain all the accidents of life.” The bards were Druid priests and poets, and skill upon the harp was long an indispensible quality.8 Diodorus and other early writers regarded Druids as very ancient—the direct descendants of Boreas, and called their followers Boreans. The mystery of Abred and the arrow of Abaris, the high priest of Apollo—a Kuthite deity—were “corner-stones of the faith,” and to “the circle of Abrid” we probably owe the name Abury.9 Stonehenge was called Gwaith-Emrys, or Emreis, or “structure of revolu-tions\"”of the sun; the neighbouring village was Ambresbury. The Arch Druid whom we usually and no doubt correctly depict as a hoary-headed sage, was the Oracle or Oris-oculus—the mouth of his god—the Sun, which is in Keltish, Suil-bheil, 1 The Druids, p. 219. 2 1 Kings vii. 25. 3 John. v. 35. 4 The Druids of Ire., p. 221. 5 Druids, p. 222. 6 Davies’ Celtic Res., p. 139. 7 D. Celtic Res., p. 182 8 Ibid., p. 191. Even in the 8th century A.C. a labourer was disgraced if he could not sing to the harp, and chaunt hymns from memory. 9 Abury [Now Avebury. — T.S.] was alluded to by Hektæus (500 B.C.)

If the oracle was a woman or Druid priestess she was called a Bean-draoi;1 if dealing in the supernatural, or held to be “a woman of supernatural life or existence,” she was called by these Kymri, Bean-si or Bean-Shee, and if of knowledge, Bean-feasa; a man of like character was a Fear-si or Fairy.2 GODS OF KELTS.—The two chief gods of historic Kelts, were Hu the Lingam, or “begetting power of nature;” and Keridwen, the bearing power. Teutons and Skands had a more elaborate theogony beginning with Woden or Oden—the Heavens or Sun (Freyer), and the All-Father or All-fadhir in which Al, though now held to be The, was undoubtedly the male prefix, the Allah of Arabia. From heaven and earth sprang Thunar or Donar, the Tor of Norsemen, but which in Thun, is really Teuth, Zeuth or Toth; to him Thursday is sacred.3 In Donar or A-Donar we probably see the God and name of the early Dorians, Danai Danians, or Dardanians—the great worshippers of Adonis. Woden or Frey, has a consort Frikka (Ger.), Frecke (L. Sax.), Frigga, Frua, Frau, or Frigg,4 the mother of all living, whose principal progeny are: IN GERMAN IN NORSE God. Goddess. God. Goddess.

Plenty. Hades. The heavens and earth—Esus and Ops, light and darkness, are here male and female, just as with early Sanskrit Aryans. As these speak of Sooryas and Asooryas, so Teutons and Skands speak of Aseus and Asinneus, Loki or Loko—“god of hellish fires,” heads the satanic forces, though it is clear he once led the heavenly, and as all nations have spirits of the woods, rivers, and mountnains, so northern story abounds with Elves—German Elfeb, and Norse Alfen. Nerthus or Nertna was a form of Heartha or Bertha, Earth, Holda, As or Isis. Thorpe describes her public procession through Aix-la-Chapelle in 1133, carried in a ship. Holda or Huldra (Norwegian) was perhapa more especially the Teuton Venus (their Herodias), Diana, and Parvati—“the mountain goddess.” It was in her mountain, Venus-berg, that Tanhäuser so long sojourned, for she was “Darkness,” and “the pro-pitious One,” who presided over the fertile energies of Air and Water, in her “Well “ was a Gan Eden or “Garden of Delight,” from whence came all the fruits of earth and children of men.6 She gets.out on tour, like all Solar gods, at Christmas, and returns at Shrovetide, for then the, young grass and seed appear. “She is goddess of houses and housewives,” who usually call her Hulda or Hola, but when it snows, “it is Bertha picking her geese” or shaking out her feather beds.

She was represented as having “large hands” and “large feet”—Sivaik euphemisms denoting fertile energy, whch in this case signify geat bearing capacity, for she was said to be “the roomy one,” web-footed, and yellow like the swan. King Pepin met her at a miller’s house (a Beth-lehm) in a forest, where she was known as “Bertha of the big foot,” and falling in love with her, the result was, as on other occasions, a son famed for wis-dom who soon became illustrious, and in this case is known to us as Charlemagne!1 TUISKO.—The great demi-god and ancestor of Germans was Tuisko, Tuisto or Tuiski, the son of Terra or Tellus, an ancient and very Sivaik deity whom Saxons some-times called Papremis. He was the father of Mannus, Manes, or Man, in fact was Toth or Tuith, and to him Tuesday was sacred.2 I repeat here a figure of him previously given, but not perhaps sufficiently explained, and also one of his goddesses, to show how low Europe was in the scale of religions, and not so very long ago.3 The lady has been described, and her lord’s devices and symbols make his character as clear as hers. Verstegan wrote of him: “This is the idol the Franks and other Germans as well as the other Saxons did also serve and adore.”4 He is Here-seul, Ermenseul, Erme-sewl, or Hermen-seul, that is “Hermes the Sun,” that Hermes or Mercury, which Tacitus and Cæsar said Germans and Saxons more especially honoured. His name is occasionally translated into “pillar of the poor” or “soul of Hermes,” by he is clearly the god of fertility, and “the poor” must signify those poor who lack offspring, flock and herds.

But there are still other significant reasons for this important and ever-recurring sign; it is simply a euphemism for that which Greeks commonly put upon male figures where the sex might otherwise be mistaken.1 In Ermen-seul’s ample breast, is the grisly bear—winter—but also the emblem of the great God and “hunter” of the northern Skands. Note also the “Trinity in unity” forming his strange skutcheon, or, as Kelts still indelicately call it, the sporan, which covers his “nakedness” (Gaelic, spuir, or spor, a “spur, thorn, or piercer”), for he has no cover-ing but this. The rose and sign of Libra is here repeated, but above them is the full round face of a lion or cat which thus takes the place, over the emblems, invariably given in Babylon and Asyria to the solar fructifier, Asher. The lewd singer of Canticles ii. shows us the force of such symbolism as roses and lilies. In regard to the name of Tuisko or Tusco, Etruscan researches have been lately throwing some light which it is important to glance at. We were taught to look upon Etruscans as Pelasgians from Lydia, ancient Mæonia, but it is clear they were one of those ancient Turaian races which pushed westward—a remnant and medley of Kuths, Akadians, Burburs, &c. The names Etrusci, Tusci, Rasena, or, as elsewhere shown, Larsena (the eponym of their Lares deity), are held to be etymologically the same, and to come from. the name of their Lydian home at the foot of the Mesoges Mountains. The customs, habits, games, dances, as well as monuments of them when in Lydia, are also such as were common to the early Italian Etruscans, and their language is that of the oldest Pelasgic, with a Phenician base,2 and if so, has its root in Akadian. This word Tasc, Tasg or Taisg, wrote the Rev. Ed. Davies some seventy years ago, “occurs more frequently than any other upon Britiah coins, and signifies God,”3 for the words ia, ie, and io are added from De, Dia, Dio, &c., with the usual suppression of the d, “which the Irish language silences by a point.” So Tascia, Tascie, and Tascio become “divine or sacred pledgem” that is, “a godly pledge or testament;” in fact, an Eduth or Jupiter Fœderis, which we are, therefore, to understand the northern Tuiseo or Tasco to be; it is correct to call the god Tusc-Dio. In the case of the female energy, the same word is introduced; for Ceres was called in very old lrish, Tasc-van-it meaning “my lady of the (corn) pledge,” where Tasc is Cet, Cete, or Ceres, and it, corn. The term navi or no, a ship, is also conatantly applied to her, as representative woman—the bearer or carrier of man’s most valued freight. She is then Tasc ia no van it, “the lady of the sacred ship of corn.” Our islanders, however, depicted her more commonly, as we so well know her in India, under the form of a sow, teeming with creation.

From furthest Asia to our own islands, nothing is more common in this lore than to exhibit Fertility as a boar and sow; Hindooism proclaims such by making the deity descend to earth as a Varāha, the sacred name for the third Avatār, in which Vishnoo manifested himself with the head of a boar, very usually depicted on the rocks and temples of India, as in part I. of this Fig. 239, taken from Coleman’s Hindoo Myth, Plate VII. The boar and Earth-Sow —Varāhi or “Divine Mother”—were the earliest types of highly prolific and certain creative energy, and also of that fierceness of passion which nature puts forth to replenish her lavish waste. In this upper figure the god seizes a reluctant man with his down right hand, and holds the solar disk above him in the other, whilst in the left hands are the female symbols, the concha, and lotus. He treads upon the Argha of a Sri-linga with his “foot”—that ever recurring euphemism—beside which stands the Indian Hercules, or Bāla-Rāma, with one fist closed, and in the other hand, the usual phallic club. In front of the Varāha is a phallic column, crowned with another creation, which his upreared arm—another euphemism —is supporting. The sculpture II. which is locally entirely disconnected with No. I., still embodies the same idea, but the Avatār is here lost in the real descent of the actual fertilising principle, which is shown in the act of impregnating womankind in as veiled a form as possible; if fully and largely depicted, it would be too indecent to print, but the broken statuary, and my very reduced drawing, renders the illustration possible.1 A woman, here too, reclines 1 The original sketch of No. II. is from a temple in Odeypoor, by Major Burt, R.

As we shall hear a great deal about boars and sows throughout Keltik and Skandi-navian lore, I have here deviated a little, so as to enable the reader to grasp the real reason why these play so important a part in northern mythology. The Skyths or Kelts of Denmark (the Belgæ), claimed descent from Ash-Kar and Embla, names evidently as coarse as Adam and Eve, or the “male and female” of Gen. 1. 27. They were said to be the offspring of the ash tree—of “love and fire;” and “wood” or “tree” in this lore has, for the most part, a phallic significance in connection with the stem, post, stake, or stauros, anciently used for crucifixons. The enemies of the gods in those days were the Jatters, from whom Tor pro-tected them, but Tor, the noble and virtuous one, once sinned, and with him most of the heavenly hosts became for a time oblivious of all morality, and so of course, did frailer Norsemen; family breaches then arose, which were only to be healed by com-promises, and hence grew or was enacted a law, coarse enough to please the most vicious, and as very similar to the ancient Jewish canon (see Gen. xxxviii.), and too common Shemitic one, I may thus state it, as prescribed for Turks. “The true wife has only exclusive claim to her husband’s caresses from sunset on Thursday to the same hour on Friday (the Turkish Sabbath and kept, they say in commemoration of that day on which God created mankind). If the husband comply with this family duty, his irregularities at other times are not of material consequence.”1 Russia had a similar law, and Muscovy further curtailed marriage rights by declaring that Monday and Wednesday were unlawful days for conjugal intercourse, though as a transgression of this law was thought likely to be common, only the very mildest penalty was pre-scribed, as bathing before entering the precincts of a Church. The fact of such laws existing, is another instance of legitimate union being thought unclean, and curiously enough, often sinful or hateful to the Creator.2 Yet Pantheons, which admitted Ana or Ana-Perena, “the Queen of Courtizans” (and Ana was the mother of all true Kelts), need not have affected such prudery, nor need Shemites with their regular institutions of temple women—Succoth Benoth or “Venuses of the Booths;” neither also need any followers of the Ana-s of the vallies of the Euphrates and Tigris. Ana-Perena was the most loved of Phenician goddesses, and in Malta or Melita we have one of the chief seats of this frail one. Some called her Dido, Elissa, or Alita, her Arabian name; but in the Eneid, Ana is sister to Elissa, though at times all creation seems to have proceeded from Ana. India knows her as Ana-poorna, “the ancient one”—wife of the “Ancient of Days”; and that Ovid knew her well, we see by his description of her indecent festivals, one of which he thus describes:3 1 Mar.

Odin and Frigg, were Siva and Sivi, Thor and Thora, the Yang and the Yin of the Chinese; and Tor is the same as Toron, whom Phenicians called Thura, and to whom they dedicated the rose, for he was “the thorn god,” as we shall yet see more fully. Kelts had a devil, but one not so formidable or fiendish as the Shaitan of Persians or the Satan of later Christianity. They named him Dusius—our Deuces, and St. Austin said he was a “libidnous demon, who did a great deal of subtle mischief, which, being unforeseen, could seldom be prevented, and must be made the best of.” We may justly suspect that “saints” as well as “sinners” palmed a good deal off upon poor Dusius, which was due to their own self-indulgent or lax moral character.1 Let us now go into some detail regarding the Keltik settlements and remains in our own islands, noting all profitable facts or stories which we find fairly authen-ticated, especially some of thosc which Col. Forbes Leslie has substantiated in his excellent volumes on The Early Races of Scotland.2 This author divides Scotland according to its remains. He naturally, and I think correctly, shows that the aborigines were those who dealt with what is known as “Earth-fast-rocks,”3 on which they have cut or scratched strange circular hiero-glyphics, often in an infantile manner. Near to these are commonly found rude upright Lingam-like stones, guiltless of any “tool-dressing” by the original erecters, but on which an after Aryan people, probably Pechs, Peches or Picts, engraved solar and sometimes alphabetical-looking hieroglyphics. The first engravers or scratchers are thought to have been Turanians of Iberian and Basque nationalities.4 Such remains mostly abound in the country between the Forth and the Orkneys, chiefly on the Eastern Coast, which has therefore been called Kruithne, the Irish name for the country of the Picts, and reminding us of the far travelled Kuthni. At, and long before the Roman invasion, it was known that Britain was comparatively rich in gold and silver; that the religion of the people was Druidik and practically one; that they were Kelts and Sabeans especially honouring Apollo or Bel, and Luna or Diana, and worshipping them under the form of Lingaik and IOnik stones, and considering them especially present in certain holy wells, groves, or mountains; stone circles were their favourite temples and Dolmens, and earth-fast rocks, their altars; but they and others were also worshipped under groves or even single trees, and epecially the oak and ash, both of which Keltik, like Greek and Latin races, revered as male gods. 1 [For the Dusii see also Wright, Worship of the Generative Powers., p. 152-3 (ed. 1894). — T.S.] 2 Edmonton and Douglas.

Kuthite Pheni-cians had, for many centuries B.C., visited Britain, and passed north even into Kaledonia or Kruithne, and before early Grecian days, these Fins had taught their British brethren much new Eastern lore, and when Helas rose, the modern Greek character. The traders jealously hid the source of their wealth, as we see from an article of a treaty of the 4 th C. B.C. between the Romans and Carthagenians, where the former agree not to extend their voyages to the west of Tartesaus—probably meaning the Straits of Kalpe,1 that Kal-linga—our Gibraltar, the S.E. guardian of the Phenician tin trade with the Turdetani, a Kuthite Turanian race. The Phenician settlements in Andalusia competed with Britain to supply tin to all the great nations of the West from the 20th Century B.C.2 to the Christian Era; and the exhaustion of the mines on the Guadalquivir must therefore have hastened British civilization, for Phenicians were thus led to colonise further, and so to carry northwards their faith, Deities, images, coins, traditions, and all the tales of the mighty worlds of Egypt, Babylonia, Asyria, &c. These would thus be even better understood in Britain than they were in Central and Eastern Europe. Although our islands were known to the readers and writers of Greece, probably before the days of Hesiod, and intimately so in the 6th C. B.C., yet this might only have been from current reports or tales of Phenician sailors and newsmongers in market places and sea-board towns; for the wary merehants made it their duty to keep all solid com-mercial knowledge as dark as possible—nay, they tried to mystify all enquirers, and con-tinually spread evil reports of the fierceness and cannibalism of nortnern tribes, such as duped Diodorus into writing as he did concerning the Irish. Aristotle’s information, however, of the 4th century B.C., was pretty correct, but so also was that of Hekateus, who possibly wrote in 520 B.C. He said, there is “an island as large as Sicily, under the Arctic pole, inhabited by Hyperboreans, with a soil rich and fruitful, and climate temperate, where the inhabitants worship Apollo above all other gods, ascribe to him the highest honours, and daily sing praises to him, behaving as if they were his priests.” He has “a stately grove and renowned temple of a round form, beautified with many rich gifts,” a city consecrated to him, and citizens never tired of tuning their lyres to the god. The inhabitants “have a language of their own, but have been visited by Greeks who have made divers gifts inscribed with Greek charac-ters.” Now “lyres” and the peculiarly religious character of the people points, as Col. F. LesIie shows,3 to Britain, and to it alone; for to none else would this apply. There is no other such island in the north, and though in Armorika, Apollo was worshipped and circles were numerous, yet it is neither an island, nor was it famed for “tuneful lyres,” nor for the religious character of its population, as Britain always has been. Cesar strongly testifies to the latter point; thus after war he says, these islanders freely heap up 1 A common Indian name. In speaking of early Phenicians I include “Cuths, Hamites,” &c. 2 Num. xxxi. 23-49, shows it was common in the time of Moses, which orthodox writers say was in the 15th century B.C. 3 Early Races, chap.

Elsewhere we are assured that the chief god here and throughout Europe, is “Hermes Megistosna Beltistos, that Ceres is represented in islands, headlands, tumuli,” arks or Kistvāens, and that Kar-nak, Stonehenge and Abury were the most important shrines of Northern Europe. Tacitus could see little difference in his day between the language and customs of the Armorikans and Britons; yet, there was a wide difference between their civilisa-tion and that of the northern Kelts. Cesar describes as one and the same, the fleets of the Veneti or Pheniti and British, which so sorely troubled him and his, as he anxiously watched from tho heights of Quiberon, a severe naval engagement in the Morbehan Sea. “The British,” he wrote, “had there two hundred and twenty fine vessels built of oaken planks, fastened by iron spikes, and caulked with seaweed; they carried anchors secured with iron cables, and their prows and poops were higher than the turrets erected upon the Roman decks;”1 so also we learn that no axes in the forests of Italy were keener, better formed, or more skilfully wielded, than were those of Albion, so that Britons even then showed some qualities, as artizans, superior to Italians; and pro-bably surpassed them in still higher traits of character, for they not only had regular Senates and laws, but knew how to obey these. Those tribes, however, who had not benefited by Phenician intercourse, and were not of the immigrant building races, were still peculiarly rude and barbarous. Even in the 7th C. A.C. the vessels, in which they dared to brave Northern seas, were mostly of wicker-work and leather, and in such “Koracles,” said certain credulous ecclesiastics, did St Columba and followers reach Scotland in the 6th century; but no reliance can be placed on any details of the Columba myth, this being a Keltik blunder in regard to Ion.2 St. Jerome in the 6th century, calls one of the leading tribes of Picts and Scots “fastidious cannibals,”3 and Kenneth II. of the 9th century—beyond which the ordi-nary historian ventures not—seems to have only just risen above this stage, for when he captured Kamelon, the capital of the Picts, “he put every living creature to the sword, or otherwise destroyed them,” so that the account of the Jewish Canaanitic massacres, would be sweet reading in his ears; he was the monarch of Skone. A short time previous to him (third quarter of the 7th century), we read of a Scotish queen strangling her husband and king for “infidelity,” a ferociousness which has certainly been resented by passing such very manly laws, as that marital adultery shall be no just cause for divorce on the part of the wife, though very strictly so should she thus sin! It has been shown that long before Phenician days, northern Kelts knew every kind of Solar, Beth-el, Lingam and Yoni worship, though not perhaps the Phenician names for the rites and gods. Keltik women then learned to weep, like those of Israel, “to-wards the north of the temple,”4 and call Tamuz—their lost summer, “the excellence of Fire,” Adonai or Dominus; thus we need not start when antiquaries tell us, that a hill on Salisbury plain is called Har-Adon, “the Hill of the Lord the Sun;” that another, near 1 Early Races, I. 58. 2 Rev.

The face of this Bath Bel forms almost a circle, from which the hair radiates like rays of light, but it is interlaced with serpents somewhat like that on the very Yom-ish coin I. and II., p. 247, and VIII. 2, of vol. I., p. 166. The sculpture may be the bearded Venus, as the upper lip has a moustache, and there is a helmet and an owl—Minerva’s bird—sitting near, with an inscription, “Suli Minervæ.” Many see a sacred term in the so common syllable Is, as in Sal-is-bury, Is-is, Osiris, &c., and as Is, is also Us or As, it may be the affix to Herak(l)es, Bubastes, &c., and a termination, like our universal Ja, Ia or Jee of the East. So not without reason did the great Orientalist, Moore, call the attention of Europe half a century ago, to her Eastern names connected with Siva and his faith. Kāla, he justly thought too suspiciously common among Kelts; in Kaledonia, he points to such sources as Kaldew, the god Kal, or to Kali-dun or dep, “the hill or place of Kal or Kali,” (Parvati), and in Calander at foot of Ben-Ledi he sees the Sanskrit word Kala-dara, a term applicable to a conical or cleft-hill as Chandri-dhara, “the moon bearer” or Siva.1 Words of the class given below2 merit the attention of those philologists who have grasped Eastern faiths as well a tongues, for without such combination we here labour in vain. The name Kali-don-ians, applied to the people in the hilly parts of the Moray Frith, was at one time Deu-caledonians (Moore, p. 398), which signifies the Deva Kala-ones, or his followers—that is, worshippers of Toth or other Phallo-Solar God. Amongst the Daki (Dacians), and Getæ (Walachians), Kal, is “a horse;” in Sanksrit, “time,” “dark-ness,\"”or “the passive principle,”3 and hence Parvati or Kāli. The Hindoo would here accept as a signification, either “horse” or “Sun,” one standing for the other; the coming, tenth Avatār, Kal-Ki, will be an equestrian. Another learned Orientalist, the late Col. Tod, agrees with Moore and the great Keltik Archeologist Davies upon many of these matters. Tod’s researches convinced him that the Keltik tribes of Gaul and Britain were as ardent votaries of Isis as were the old Italians, and none were more enthusiastic about the Bona Dea than Geti and Goths. Tod says:4 “The worship of Isis obtained throughout Keltik Gaul as in Italy ere Rome was founded; she was an indigenous divinity, not of exotic adoption,” and the capital of the Franks—the abode of the Keltik Parisii, is held to be named after the goddess. Her statue was still in the Abbey of St. Germain in the year 1514, “when the piety of the Archbishop of Meaux interposed to the destruction of this object of ancient superstition,” because people were then found worshipping and begging favours from it. It was black, says Tod, and 1 Moore’s Oriental Frags., see Index, Moon, &c. 2 Culloden. Kalic (Gaelic)  Il-Colm-Kil, Apollo Killæus. Kilikes, Kelts. Colonsay. Columba or Col-O-M. Kil-da, Kil-dair.

The town of Falaise is full of Keltic remains, and derives its name “from the symbolic worship of the divinity, PHALOI-ISIS, contracted Falaisia, Falesia, Falaise,” &c. The temple was specially constructed by solar worshippers as if for an observatory, and Isis was here shown in her pleasant form of Mata Janoni or “Mother of Births,” not as in Paris, Sookha Mata, “the dry mother,” or she who looks to destruction as well as life, like her Lord, and Jahveh. (Deut. xxxii. 39). It is in the article here quoted that Tod gives a drawing of this Sivaite ring, “as dug up on the Fort hill near Montrose” about 1825;1 his is a full front view, with the bull kneeling on each side of the Lingam, but my sketch—a side view from Higgins—necessarily omits the bulls, because they would hide the organ or deity. The gem is one which would be highly valued by every worshipper at Vesta’s shrine; Tod says it must have belonged “to some Keltic adorer of Isis, or one of those giant Getes from Skania who in ancient times found sepulture in their descents on the Scots.” “The symbols of creative power here seen, are,” he adds, “precisely like those wreathed round the minor temple of Isis at Pompeii,” for “in the terra cotta Penatis of the same divinity (4000 of which were excavated from the precincts of her fane at Pestum), the goddess holds in her right hand this same symbol” —the Lingam. This orientalist found all the Phallic symbols at Cortona, Pompeii, and Pestum, and hence concludes that the Ganges, Nile, Tiber, and Arno are all connected by one vast mythological chain, and not through Kelto-Etruscan tribes only. “Romans had no occasion,” he says, “to import the rites of Isis from Egypt;” they existed long before the Eternal City. “Her name (that of Isis) is the same, and bears the same signifi-cation in Keltic as in Greek; Suetonius the historian tells us that the imperial epithet Cæsar, deprived of its initial letter, means Dominus in the old Tuscan. Thus the Esar and Es-és of the Etrusci are the Es-wara and Esa of the Hindoos,” and Etrus-cans too, had castes like these; “The Larthes or Tyrani were the Lords; the Tusci, the Priesthood; the Rar-senæ,2 the warriors; and the Mass, the caste populaire.” Tod thinks that we probably see the origin of ’Truscans in the Turshka or Toskan invaders of India, for northern India was long held by an Indo-Skythic, Turshka or Takshák race, famed like Etruscans for their serpent and phallic worship. Turans, Truscans and Turks came from the same land, and their name from their faith or deities Ta and Ur. Tod suggests that the Osci were Opici, or a serpent race who carved characters on their rocks such as Etruscans adopted, and which we also find in Saurāshtra (Western India), where they are said to have been 1 Trans.

The serpent is the imparter of knowledge, and there Naga races always had a great name for learning. The Takshaks were called “wise serpents,” that is wise Ophiolaters like the Kadmians, A-chads, or Achaians. At “Toule, the capital of the ancient Luci, the most perfect Sri-Lingams have been found; qui ont la forme d’un cone tronqué, et pour socle une bordure en forme de coquille.1 The Keltic Parisii adored Isis under the form of a boat, as did the Swevi and other tribes of the north;” the boat was sacred to dwellers on “the shores of the Baltic and to colonies of Thussa-Getæ, driven from their seats between the Caspian and Euxine by Darius Hystaspes six centuries B.C.” As Pelasgians, Etrurians, and Greeks came from the same lands, we need not wonder at their having the same faith.2 Our Saxons were the Saka-Senæ; the Getes or Yeuts, those who seized Yeutland or Jutland, whilst the Su, Suiones and Swevi, are named by us Swedes. The first emigrants seem to have been vary fair, and commonly classed as Getes, but the later were the As-es or Asiatics, followers of As, a swarthy race, coming from Mid-gara of the central region. A word here as to the perplexities which a too strict philology occaaionally causes. The war—sometimes waxing fierce—between our modem philologists as to Turanian, Aryan, and Shemitic nations and terminologies of their names etc., does not seem likely to end, till the combatants get versed in the ancient gods and rites which enter into nearly all the leading words of the earliest languages, nor until the comba-tants acknowledge some fixed period when these tongues were one, or at least had not separated or got beyond the Rhematic or Nomadic state.3 When vowels were rarely noticed in writings, and l, r, t, and d were used almost indifferently (making, as Mr. Sayce complains, every attempt to accurate definition of Egyptian and other old names all but impossible), of course our present strict rules of philology are at fault; not so, however, the vision of the student of faiths. Al and Ar, Adhi Boodha and Athi Boodha, nay, Ather and Asher does not confuse him. Mr Sayee quotes as quite incomprehensible such strange facts, as that the Phenician Ge-bal, is the Egyp-tian Ka-paon; that Sardaina (Sardinia) was formerly Khair-etana; that Mr. Glad-stone (who, he says, curiously enough, considers the Egyptian language of Homer’s days, Turanian), identifies, Ta-Anau or Da-Anau with the Da-naans, while “yet Egyptologists are still doubting whether to connect them with the Danaas of Homer or the Daunians of ltaly.” To turn the Akai-usha into the Akhæans (Akæans), is called a very bold proceeding, because “those who do so have never been able to account for the final sibilant of the name.” So “the Tursha cannot be the Tyrrhenians or Etrus-cana, whose native name was Rasena, any more than the Shar-daina or Shaltains, can be the Sardinians.”4 Now, such difficulties meet us daily in the East, and in the course of business one forgets all about authority for “final sibilants,” and sadly mixes up Aryan and Turanian speech whilst conversing in Tamil, Telagoo, Kānaresa, 1 Trans.

The Sar, Shar, and Shal, nay Khair or Kur, may look a little formidable on paper, but not so in the coloquial of illiterate tribes; such would in no way perplex him who understood Sun worshippers, and the loose fashion in which untaught peoples use these solar terms. Sardinia is, in all probability, the des, dis, or “country” of Sar worshippers, as Khair-etāna is the stāna or abode of Khair or Kur-ists, that is of Solarists—those Akai, Akæans, Akai-Meni, or men of Ak, whose mythic ances-tor was Akaios, Son of the Sun and brother of IOn. Ge-bal and Ka-pa-On, present no difficulty to the searcher after faiths; Ge and Ka, and E and A, are similar and com-mon affixes as to words like Bal, A-Kad, K’On etc.; Pa-On or Pi-On, represent the Sun in active power. Now as Ta is Da—that ubiquitous god whom some made Toth, Tor, Teu, etc., others Dev, Deus, Zeus, so Da-An-ians are the followers of a god and faith we thoroughly understand; whether Egyptologists doubt the locale or not. From a religious point of view, the great facts of the faiths are settled, and it therefore only remains for Egyptologists and philologists to adapt their rules to the facts. We cannot ignore faiths in words or names because they fail to meet our etymological rules. Da-anians, like Christians, differ according as they are Egyptians or Italians. We know that the Resenæ or Larsenæ of Asia became Etruscans or Tuskans in Italy, and it seems unreaaonable to assert, on mere philological grounds, that “Tur-sha or Tur-sa cannot be Tyrrhenians or Etruscans.”1 This is but saying that Etruscans cannot be Tur-enians, for we must often ignore in these old tougues the absurd pedantry with which later mystifiers, or men infatuated with their subject, hand down to us the spelling of their pet languages, such as Irish, Gaelic, Welsh, Norse, etc. No doubt rude Irish and Welsh cotters and Highland shepherds do drawl out their words in a wonderful way, which no amount of w’s, v’s, l’s, j’s, h’s, or combinations of these can give us the echo of, any more than we can spell a sneeze or the neigh of a horse; if we were to attempt to present to scholars the tongues of the Indian hill tribes in the same manner, we should be equally at fault. This is not; how-ever, permissible where we have to compare one language with another; we must eradi-cate the uneducated singing drawl, though of course with great care and see that we do not lose the essence or root. All languages have at first been spelt by early illiterate writers who knew neither the principles or true powers of letters as we now have these; and hence the absurd combinations of double ll’s dd’s, wv’s, and such jargon as Gnewydd, Ovlldaach, Llwyddiantt, Ybydd, etc., as occur in old Irish, Welsh, and Gaelic writings.2 Very few learned men even yet know these languages, and apparently none do so sufficientIy well to enable them to tackle the whole subject and upset the bigotry of less literary persons, who are however well up in the vernacular, and delight in a mode of spelling which none but themselves can understand or pronounce, and they only because they have otherwise learned the words. It is high time to reduce 1 Ibid. Sardinia has Turans before the Ili, Ioli, or Solarites. Dic. G. & R.

Here we have the Sacred Oak, with its symbolic Acorns hanging from Jove or Tor, names of this Keltik. “Tree of Life.” The tree leans over the two stones pillars, though it is often-times placed between them, as in Pl. IV. 11 and 1, 3, 4, and 9, where man or a burning column, becomes the tree, and ser-pents (Passion) take the place of “the Stones.” Besides these last in this Fig. 241, stands the “altar of incense” with the sacred fire in a cup, Maya’s emblem, but here also the sand glass of Kronos, whilst below is the Concha Veneris, or Chrysalis of all nature, under the appropirates inscription, “Amborsie Petre,” meaning “the Anointed rock,” Messiah, or Maha Deva, that ever-anointed one.1 I repeat here, from Vol. I., another Tyrian coin, where the Phallic Herakles takes the place of the tree, showing the close connection of the ideas; for detailed explanation see that volume, p. 280, and compare also Figs. 19, 76, and several of its plates. The tree, tables, and vase remind us of the Jewish sprig of Almond tree, the two sacred stones (which regulated all their social life), and pot of manna and incense, showing us that these old Phenicians taught Jews as well as British Druids.2 Jews were not single in calling a stone, or rother the Stone-God, Tsur, “their father,” for our Druid ancestors called Toth, Tot, or Tad, his Dad or Father, and set up many a stone to him as at Tad-Caster, Tut-bury, Tet-worth, Tot-hill, Tot-en-ham, Tot-er-down, or Taute-down, near Abury, which the reverend author of Hermes Britanicus inclines to read “Ambrosebury, or Amesbury.”3 The adjoining town of Overton, or Obar-dun, General Vallencey thinks is from the old Keltik name for an observatory—Obair.4 Ares or Mars, the Skythic and Keltik God of Wat, and Jupiter Tonans, has left to us an heritage of mauy names, such the hill of Mar-den in Wiltshire, which stood near Tan-hill, or hill of Tan-arna or Taranus, the Keltik God of Thunder—Taran, Thoran or Thor and Thorn, the Obelisk, Ray or Piercer—the Jupiter Stator, who stood in the centre of that charmed ellipse of the Capitoline. If Latins wor-shipped him by the erection of obelisks, pillars, and altars, as we see in all the ancient 1 For “Messiah,” see vol. I. pp. 150, 270, 334. 2 Phenicians were on Mediterranean 2750 B.C.

Fig. 244.—THE POLYNESIAN GOD TA-RA-OA, OR ALMIGHTY ONE. Circuses of Rome, no less did ancient Kelts and Teutons, each in their own way, honour him by holding their festivals around the base of his statues or symbols. This is an outline sketch of some of the many emblematic objects under which Rome euphemized and hon-oured the procreating, formative, and receptive principles of nature. My readers should consult Mont-fauçon for detailed drawings of a Circus Roma, and the full meaning of the spire between the two-winged men on pillars, and on those Dwarkas, or gates of Parvati, from which spring the triangle, fire and ethereal-like figures. The trisool, or three-peaked columns over the mysterious hollow arks at end, form the turning points of the many strivers after fame and victory; no object was here without a sacred meaning. In Cheshire an altar was discovered sacred to “Jupiter Tenarus,” inscribed “D.O.M. TANARO,” who was with Kelts the god of thunder and fire. Tarra was fire in old Irish, and we have Turara as an Indian name of the same, so that Turans or Turanians were probably the worshippers of this God. The Irish called their “lighted beacon” Crois-tarran, which it was death to extinguigh, and taran } r t was also the Hebrew and Kaldi word. The Gauls wrote Ton-er, Tonnerre, and in time Ton and Tan became Fire, or “the place of Fire,” as in Bel-tan or rather Bel-teine, for Tan or Stān in India and South Europe, is undoubtedly a place—“holy place,” hence altar; in Ireland La Bel-tine is the month of May or Bel’s Fire, for Tein is the Gaelic for fire, and Tan the same in Welsh and Cornish. The effect, has been here then, substituted for the cause, just as the Jewish Ark usurped the reverence due only to the God—the Eduth for which it was built; so the Altar or “holy place” of this God Ta, Tan, or Tine, obtained his name and worship.1 In Toran, as in Bel-tine, we can find the god’s character,2 for Tor, is Ta-Or, or Ta-Ar, in which it is observ-able that Ta takes the place of the Abdian, Kaldian, and Hebrew Pi, so that the deity is “the Divider,” the Pi or Pe-Or, for whom Moabites aud Jews fought, dividing their love and fear betwixt him and the thundering gods of Arabi-Petra. Ar-ene was Cerid-wen or “Citadel of the Ark.” This Tor-an is then a fitting god for the centre of the Drurid circle, and it is clearly him, also, that we see in the centre of the Polynesian shrines, where he appears as this strangely feathered deity, under the name of TA-RAO. When huge, and girded more valiantly, he is (see p. 444, Vol. I.), denominated TA-AROA, according to the spelling on the figures presented by the mission- 1 Many careless writers say that Sal and Bel both mean hills, heights or Omphi, as well as the Sun, because the sun is here worshipped; this is identifying Jahveh with his temple. 2 See Gen.

They long stood in the Kensington Museum, gazed at in wonderment by gay throngs of ladies and children, to whom, of course, everything was perfectly incomprehensible except the title—“The Almighty God of the Polynesians”—unwittingly placed there by probably pious men, though mayhap in derision, as was that somewhat similar inscription over the cross of Christ. The title corresponds to MAHA Deva or Jupiter Stator, and perhaps even more strictly to that of Al-Shadai or the Covenanting God of Abraham. His stony counterparts are seen in Fig. 223 ante. It is unfortunate that we can scarcely anywhere find a tolerably perfect Druidic circle, for I feel certain that if we did, we should find a Tor in the centre, as well as a Lingam-pointer, towards the east, the ray over which would mark that period when Sol in greatest productive energy, shines into the “Holy of Holies.” Let me ask my readers to here re-peruse pages 280-282 of Vol. I., and I will now state, though perhaps a little in repetition, the true religious idea of Stonehenge. It is generally acknowledged that this was a shrine to Apollo or Belenus, and younger than that at Abury, which is thought to be more the shrine of ophioialators and fire-wor-shippers than Solarists. The mortic-ing of the Stonehenge blocks points to Phenician art, which latterly set aside the ancient rules as to using only un-dressed stones. No one who has studied phallic and solar worship in the East could, I think, make any mistake as to the purport of this shrine, although I confess the many accounts which I had read had not awakened my attention to the real facts, so misleading are many European writers on this, to them, unknown lore. Here stand upright stones, forming as it were, a circular shaft within a perfect argha or spoon-like enclosure, and there—to the eastward, the holy “Pointer” in the Os-Yoni, over whose apex the first ray of the rising god of the midsummer Solstice (21st June) shines right into the centre of the sacred circle. His eastward path is denoted by a long avenue, which diverges into two lines of wavy trench and embankment as it approaches the Lingam Pointer, around which and the circle, it sweeps in an oval form. On all sides of this sacred spot are to be seen, scattered over a now bare undulating country, large and small barrows or earthen mounds, the receptacles, no doubt, of the ashes, if not bones, of the dead who once worshipped at the hallowed shrine, for it is clear the population of these days, like that of our fathers, loved to be buried around their church; they were perhaps wiser, however, than we, first burning the corpses, and only collecting the innocuous ashes to repose in these cellular caskets. The occurrence of such, all around the temple, reminds us of the holy spots which surround Hindoo shrines, and to which visits must be paid by every devotee, after he or she has worshipped "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 233Fig. 246.—I. STONEHENGE FROM EAST AVENUE WITH LINGAM. II. THE LINGAM ENLARGED. III. ABURY AND SILISBURY. at the central holy place. If zealously pious, this is done, as elsewhere described, on hands and knees, and under a scorching mid-day sun, and always with many offering to each holy spot, for without these no priest can bestow his saintly blessing. In May 1874 I made some very careful drawings of the Stonehenge shrine,1 and in the “Pointer,” at once distinguished “the ever-anointed one.” He faces towards the circle, and in spite of every allowance for the accidents of weather-wear, &c. no one who has at all looked into Sivaik lore, will hesitate for a moment in pronouncing him a veritable Maha-Deva; the prepucial lines have worn stronger than they pro-bably first were, so that decency forbid our drawing the object larger than in the side-cut No. II., which represents the “Pointer” as seen in the Os-Yoni of No. I. Those persons who have studied such monoliths all over the world, in the mar-ket-crosses and Hermai at cross-roads in Skythic and Keltish lands, and in the shrines of Greek and Latin races, will have no hesitation in agreeing with me; yet the indelicacy of the whole sub- ject often so shocks the ordinary reader, that, in spite of facts, he cannot grant what he thinks shows so much debasement of the religious mind; facts are facts however, and it only remains for us to account for them. Perhaps indeed in these later times an artificial and lower phase of sensuality has taken the place of the mere natural indulgence of the passions, for procreative purposes, which principally engrossed the thoughts of early worshippers. We have also in a great measure over-looked and forgotten much of the whole general subject of fertility, and the awe and piety with which the whole idea of Nature’s prolific energies was viewed. These, in their ever-recurring seasons, called forth some of the holiest emotions of our nature, and a religious spirit which has enthralled the mind of the most intelligent as well as illiterate, in a manner and with a potency which no other religion has done. Other religions, when leaving the Phallic phase, have striven to put this parent Faith down by attributing impurity to the necessary carnal acts of creation, and this until the very word. carnal has become associated with irreligion: but Nature and its special faith held on its way nevertheless, claiming natural acts to be pure, and men are begin-ning to see that impurity is rather the lot of those who oppose Nature. She rejoices with the youth and maiden in their heyday of health and strength, no less than with the young mother when she first clasps a babe to her bosom, and with all animal and bird life at their fertilising periods; but more, she was thought to command man and 1 [And then had some careless and inaccurate ones engraved instead. — T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 234woman to adore her in the teeming fields of earth, as each arrived at maturity, and there accordingly they crowded glad to assist at her acts, or anxiously to await her births. The name of the faith (Phallic), is an unfortunate one, but in this matter the names of the supreme Gods and their symbols have always dominated. I give in Fig. 246 a plan of Abury (No. III.) sufficient for the purpose of this work, for readers carefully studying the whole, will of course go to some of the many special works on the subject, of which we have a surfeit. Abury is simply a great earthen circle, which had at one time, two or more sacred circles of monoliths, within it, and two serpentine avenues branching from it in a very favourite Solar form—often repeated in hieroglyphs, as in col. VI., Fig. 233. The name, Ab-Ur, seems composed of two Eastern and old world words, Ab and Ur, “Father or Possessor of Fire,” one having much to do with Ophite worship. The leading feature before the shrine is the conical Mount of Silbury or Silsbury—the sacred seat of Jove or Tonarus; at its base runs the old Roman road, the course of which has been clearly altered on account of it. I cannot find any “pointers” or central stones at Abury, for the whole shrine has been most disgracefully knocked about. There was a peculiar stone outside the Kennet or south circle commonly called “The Ring Stone,” as having a hole through it, and Hermes Britanicus and Higgins particularly notice this. In 1828-9 its position was S.E. of the two circles, and nearly in the prolongation of their centres; having a ring through it, would probably make it too convenient a standard for the tethering of cattle, for our despoilers to resist. All writers notice three monoliths in the centre of the N.W. circle. Stukely calls the high centre one, “the obelisk,” and the Rev. W. L. Bowles, Taute; others, “the three Kabiri,” or “powerful ones.” Stukely, who is quite innocent of any Taut-ish idea, quotes an important passage in Pausanias in support of his serpent theory, viz.: “Whoever goes from Thebes to Glisas will see A GREAT CIRCLE OF STONES, which is called the head of the Theban serpent.”1 It is described as emerging from a cavern under the mountain of “The Supreme One”—all phallic terms and ideas—just as in the case of the Loch Nell dragon, Fig. 133, Vol. I., 288. We find these colossal forms of the Aerial Scorpion all over the world, on plains, hills, and dales, and abundantly wherever Kooths and Kelts dwelt, see my Plates VI. and VII. The Silsbury cone may not only be the Tot, Toth, or God, but the head of the pytho-phallic Deity, and his place here to the sunny sonth side of the shrine, is exactly where we would expect to find him. His name Sil or Sul, is most likely the Sun, and we observe that it is a cone here rising abruptly out of a swamp or lake-like spot, as all Maha Devas should. The lands, we are told, “Were here hollowed out, so that it should appear surrounded by the sacred waters of the adjoining Druidical spring of the Kennet,”2 and it also abuts on a stream which flows from it towards the shrine; and is South or Sun-wise from this, and flanked by two softly-falling hills, through 1 Her.

Brit., p. 113."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 235which the stream flows, thus combining all the leading characteristics of a sacred Solo-phallic mount. Mr. Bowles insists that Abury was a temple to Teutatis, Tot, or Tor, and that the God’s seat—Sils-bury or Sal-is-bury, in which Sal-is denotes the sacred Sun-town, was so placed between it and Stonehenge, that both shrines might see the Thunderer’s Bel-fire symbols. It was after I had satisfied myself as to the Stonehenge “Pointer” that I found some other writers had regarded it with suspicion; Colonel Forbes Leslie had long pre-viously devoted very careful attention to the subject, for his Indian researches had shown him its importance, just as in my own ease. He speaks, prior to 1866, of having found these solitary stones outside of most circles, and devotes several pages to what he call “the excluded member.” “Though placed aloft,” he writes of one Indian circle, “it was of the same size, and it, as well as all the other stones, had its inner surface whitened, and over the white—near the apex (for they were selected of a pyra-midal form) was a spot of red colour. . . . Not only in this circle,” he adds,” but in others of the kind, I have observed the stone placed towards the east, and outside the enclosure. . . . Any one who may have visited Stonehenge, cannot fail to have remarked a large monolith called the Friar’s Heel, standing in nearly the same position relative to that Monument,”—information quite unknown to me when I recorded my own views as to this monolith after a visit to the Solar Shrine in 1874. The full and startling significance of this and other phallic symbolism embraced in the drawings by Colonel Forbes Lesliel as of the Brogar Circle, Orkney, the Rollrich Circle, Oxfordshire (Plate VII., page 291), the Callernish Circle, Ile of Lewis, (Plate VIII., 71 page 386), and two Persian circles, (Plates Xl. and XII.), one of which has an incised or Yoni stone, such as Abury was famous for, will be clear to every careful examiner of these IOnim temples. Strange also that the word “Heel” should still attach to the Phallus; see Vol. I., pp. 94, 140, and 246, on this important “Excluded Member” of the circles. Colonel Forbes Leslie noticed that this stone had a very differ-ent bedaubing to that of all the other stones. Near the top he found white patches, daubed with a bright red oval centre, the meaning of which, he says, is not clear to him, but he points out that “Verrmilion, oil, or minium was used in Rome to paint Jove’s statue (query. symbol?) on festal days; also for various purposes on oc- casions of triumphs, and for obscene emblems of objects of worship.” This is still the practice all over India, showing how closely Greece and Rome have followed Indian cult. Especially is it used for Omphi, or rotund, egg-like objects, a protruding ovate face of a rock or tree; under such a tree there would be sure to be seen or imngined, and unmistakably depicted, an Eva, Chavah, or cleft; the nature of this besmearing shows the object is dedicated to the Deities of Fertility, red oil or water marking this all over the Eaat for very obvious reasons. When the above was preparing for press, I observed the following in a daily paper in regard to the orientation of Stonehenge, apparently written by one of a party "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 236Fig. 247.—DRUID CIRCLE, KESIK, SHOWING ITS SOLAR IDEA. of excursionists, who appear to have set out with a determination to test for themselves the assertion as to the Sun rising over the Pointer on the 21st June. After describing the circle, altar stone, and eastern avenue, this correspondent states:— “In the direct line of this avenue stands one solitary stone in a sloping position, in front of which, but at a considerable distance, is an eminence or hill. The point of observation chosen by the excursion party, was the stone-table or altar near the head of, and within the circle, directly looking down the avenue. The morning was unfavourable; but fortunately, just as the sun was beginning to appear over the top of the hill, the mists disappeared, and then for a few moments the onlookers stood amazed at the phenomenon presented to view. While it lasted, the sun, like an immense ball, appeared actually to rest on the isolated stone, of which mention has been made, or—to quote the quaint, though prosaic, description of one present—‘It was light a huge pudding placed on the top of the stone !’ Another very important fact mentioned by an elderly gentleman, who had resided for many years in the neigh-bourhood, was that on the setting of the sun at the winter solstice a similar phenomenon was observ- able in the direction of certain other stones to the westward. I lately examined another solar shrine, near Keswick (Kesik), in Cumberland, which is as remarkable in the matter of selection of site as any I have seen. Owing, how-ever, to its being on a very fertile eminence, where fine arable land is scarce, the agriculturists have left no trace of avenue or Argha, and even turned many of the stones into a rude hut or cattle pen.1 Nevertheless, there is no mistaking the shrine, from its wonderfully characteristic position—the only one, indeed, in all “The Lake Districts” (excepting hill peaks, which are for karns and pillars, never for circles), where Sol’s worshippers could haye got all the peculiarities they require. Here alone the rising sun can enter the very matrix, as it were, of these mountains, and at the instant he peers above the far-off fertile meads and dwarfed hills to the eastwards, his rays at once strike this altar site, and shine up all the broad, clear valley, which here contracts and divides the stern and craggy heights of lofty Skidau on the north, from the more softly swelling mountains of Helvellyn and Ulleswater on the south; only after glint-ing, as the old Kelts would say, around their sacred mount Zion, and overtopping it, can Bell’s full effulgence fall upon the garden meads of fair Keswick, and its sweetly embosomed Queen of Lakelets—the Derwent. I here give a sketch-plan made on the spot in illustration of what I describe. The holy hill may also be called the source or watershed of the beautiful streams—the Derwent and Eden, down which rush the surplus stores of Derwent-water and Ulles Lakes, combined with those from many a wild rocky tarn or pent-up “Force,” which, after tumbling over the preci-pices of Skidan and Helvellyn, are hid among their sweetly wooded glades, and finally emerge amidst the softer, but still exquisite scenery surrounding these once sacred hills. 1 I could only count 39 stones in position, and only one outer circle, slightly elliptical."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 237As regards the age of these so-called Druid circles, history points to all the eoarly world being dotted with them, so that they were probably—after the tree or grove of trees, the first places of worship; their age may be any time prior to book or national faiths, although many are known to have been formed long after these last. The fame of Abury was European, if not Eastern, in the 4th, or, at all events in the 3d century B.C. In the combined number and size of its monoliths, it seems to have had no rival, save Karnak, in Europe, Asia, or Africa. It had of level ground, within its circling mound of 1300 feet diameter, upwards of 28 acres. Its stone columns were 27 feet apart, and from 14 to 17 feet high. It had a couple of avenues more than two miles in length—one having 258 monoliths, and terminating in a circle; the other in a single stone, but in its centre was the “Devil’s Koil,” or grove, seeming to suggest the difference in termini which we see in the suggestive hieroglyphs of No. 233, on p. 166. The plan of Abury is exactly that of the Solar-python given at foot of Col. VI., minus the wings, and evidently connected in ideas with the two above it, which is more fully ehlboroted iuthe Sun-serpent with phallic cross, given at top of Col VIII. of Fig. 233. The strange cone of Silbury rises, as it were, between the arms or serpent of the solar disk, and. to a height of 125 feet, with a base diameter of 500 feet, and summit width of 100. All archeologists who have at all grasped the subject of this ancient worship, have endeavoured to find out the God or pillar of the Omphe. The Rev, Mr, Bowles tells us that he dug into the centre of the Silbury Cone, “where the stone image stood,” and there found a hole exactly such as Mr Britton has discovered on the top of Marden Hill.1 This might, if taken by itself, afford but little proof of all conical hills having phalli or monoliths; but then presumption is overwhelming where we see karns, columns, and temples on conicol hills in every corner of the world. Thus, where there is no karn, we usually find a column; and even when we have a karn—Acervii Mercuriales—we have also very commonly a shaft of wood or stone let into it, or small egg or phallic-shaped stone on its summit. The Greeks denominated such as `Ermaia touj liqoj touj ‘Ermaiouj, of which the Karnak mound is a good sample.2 The Rev. Mr Bowles, quoting Toland, says that “St. Patrick’s first church in Ireland was built where stood three of these vst stones . . . . . called Donach Patric.” That he, Patrick, inscribed on the three stones in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin the three words, “JESUS, SOTER, SALVATOR,” all strictly Solo-Phallic terms which no Sivaite would object to, because corresponding to “The Lord, he who preserves,” “the Creator,” “the Increaser” (Joseph), Phos or Phre, a column would fairly represent Jeshir the “Upright One,” and Joaiah stands for “the Fire of the Lord,” and some say the Serpent. See these words in Inman’s Anc. Faiths.3 The Circle of Avebury lies low, “is level and surrounded on all sides by receding 1 Hermes Brit., p. 81. 2 P. 302, Vol. I., Fig. no. 135. 3 I. 647, et. seq.

VII. 6, PAGE 248 hills of gentle declivity, altogether forming an amphitheatre from whence a whole nation might witness the smoke of sacri-fice ascending from thickly-clustered columns of rocks;” and unlike those of Stonehenge, the Avebury columns “are whole stones over which no man hath lifted up any iron.”1 Stennes in Orkney, says Col. F. Leslie, comes next to Avebury in size, but of course none can compare with Karnak, which had at one time 12,000 to 20,000 monoliths, of which 60 years ago upwards of 4000 were counted, and many were then 22 × 12 × 6 feet above ground. There even now remain 1200, measuring from 5 to 20 feet above ground level. Single Lingam columns were very common on all the hills about Karnak, and on all Keltik coasts from Iberia and Armorika to “the Green Isle” of the Ierne, and nearly every other sacred island in the world. St Michel of Karnak had a very fine Hermaik pillar on its summit, which was only very slightly disturbed by the Christians when they planted their Ark beside the Column of this Archangel, so that now the two stand suitably side by side pourtraying the two true Solo-phallic ideas. I have only spoken of one of the Karnak Tumuli or Karns with a column on it, but many others will be found in Col F. Leslie’s volumes.2 He notices particularly the Tumuli and shaft at Foulis in Perthshire as a good specimen of what I would call this Beth-lechem or Bread-hand-Mill-Idea, and which I have as such particularly dwelt on, at page 303 of Vol. I. The Shaft or Phallus was correctly called by Kelts the Clach na Greine or “Stone of the Sun,” see the description given of that one on the islet of Berneray adjoining to Kalli-gray—probahly “Grein”—a very suitable Sivaik name. Here the central shaft, says Col. F. Leslie, was of the usual “conical form but inverted, the narrow end being fixed in the ground,” the circle was only 10 feet in diameter, but well defined by long sharp stonee; there was a holy well and a very ancient abrine of Anait or Anaitess, the Artemis, Hekate, or Moon Goddess.3 We are told of a precisely similar shrine called the “Circle of Boscawen-Un,” near Land’s End, not more than 25 feet in diameter, and with only 19 stones in 1824.4 A word as to inverted Lingams. The inverting of Maha Devas of unequal diameter, is no new thing; we see a very sacred Persian Lingam on my PlateVIII., which has the narrow portion of the shaft in the ground and such Lingams seem again coming into favour all over Northern India, as for several years past I have observed many new ones so formed and so placed in their Arghas. The only rules for the construction of Lingams which I have seen in sacred writings, prescribe that the shaft shall be vertical except at the apex or glans, 1 Exod. xx. 25; Jos. viii. 31. 2 Early Races, II. 328, Pl. xxxv, &c. 3 Ibid., I. 102.

The inverted egg or cone is represented in the classic periods of Europe, Egypt, and Western Asia, by an inverted pyramidal shaft on which is seen a Phallus, and on top, a bust or Hermes. The egg-shape denotes the female Deity, for Diana or the Artemis polumastos, is “the egg-carrier,” and to her the Sri-Linga is sacred; her Spartan name was Orthia, “the erect one.” Skye possesses a Tempoul-na-Anait, and numerous places in the Hebrides bear the name of this goddess, who wag of course the Anaitis of Asyria, Phenicia, and indeed of all Western Asia, and “very popular she was, in West of England.”1 Strabo de-scribes her worship in Persia. under the name of Anæa, and says the Persians erected to her an artificial mound of carth over a rock, on the plains near the Euxine, where they defeated the Sakæ—those ancestors, doubtless, of the European Saxons. Anaitis, Omanus, and Anadatus, Strabo adds, may all be worshipped on the same altar; and Pliny says Anæa was the first goddess who had a statue of gold. If the Moon, she must be a form of our Eastern Nania or Chandri—the Female Moon, or of Mao or Soma the male; under both forms she is always worshipped at certain periods with very obscene rites. Christianity has not even yet suppressed this throughout Europe, though in England it early attempted to do so, and with such continued and consider-able vigour, that, aided by education, it has been at last successful. The Archbishop of Canterbury in the 7th Century fulminated severe orders against all who did homage to the moon, and his Grace of York did tho same, the following century; none were to attempt to augur by sun, moon, and stars.2 In Bretony, however, the people were neither so advanced, nor the Christian on-slaught so vigorous or continued, and hence we read that “ancient and still existing ceremonies which are both lascivious and obscene,” are to be found in connection with the Moon and Menhirs, especially that of Kerloaz,3 the granite phallus with two strange protrberances at base, which are mildly shown in Fig. 11 of my Plate IX., p, 168, II. Against these “protruberances,” those desirous of offspring rubbed themselves and per-formed quaint obscenities in connection with the course Venus of Hennebon, now known by the significant names of Quin-ipili or Quim-Perle of Baud. It appears that the clergy, headed by a neighbouring noble, succeeded in getting the indecent goddess cast into the River Blavet; but the Bretons, resenting this, threatened their masters—spiritual and temporal, with the result, that Groah-goard or Grouech-Houarn (the Iron Woman) was restored to a superior throne, where she has continued ever since, and been there piously worshipped, as Phenician Venuses usually were, in a manner we would rather not describe.

She was not then alone, nor is she so yet, for Christianity placed near to her, a Notre Dame de la Joie, Notre Dame de la Liesse, and immediately beside her, Notre Dame de la Clarte1—all very notorious names. We are justified in connecting the gods of different peoples when we see them bearing nearly the same traits and the same names, and engaged in the same offices; this though certain rules are transgressed which some philologists have apparently too hastily jumped at; thus El, the early Phenician and Turanian God, is also the Shemitic Al of Arabia. The Rev. Baring Gould writes:2 “Civilised gods who diffuse intelligence and instruct bar-barians, are also solar deities, as the Egyptian Osiris, the Nabathean Tammuz, the Greek Apollo, and the Mexican Quetzalcoatl; beside these Oannes takes his place as the Sun-God giving knowledge and civilisation. . . . Oannes is the Mizraimite On and the Hebrew Aon, . . . the original name of the God reverenced in the temple of Heliopolis, which in Scripture is, called Beth-Aon, the house of On,” corresponding to “Beth-Shemesh, the house of the Sun.” Oannes is the Greek form, and a very confusing one, for On, the Sun-God; the A before his name is merely an active or generating male affix. For reasons elsewhere given, and probably of a Turanian nature, the On becomes also Om, and the Eastern Aum or Aom and Egyptian Am; the Keltik Anaa or Anait was the same deity whether in Akadian or Shemitic tongues. Female as well as male gods are horned, and hence we have the bull and heifer, or the Sun—the horned darter, and the moon in virgin purity, as in Io and Artemis, though Moon goddesses are also mermaids or half-fish, and very impure, with a peculiar predilection for moisture.3 The Oanes of Kaldia is, in Palestine, represented by Atergatis or Dorketo, she who appeared on the shores of Joppa, as the Greek “Keto, with comely cheeks,” the “daughter of sea and earth, and wife of Phoreys,”4 that is P’Or-Kus, whom Syria called Tirgata. Moist goddesses have generally very fiery lords, as Baal with Baalti, Molach with Mylita. which last lord required priests in womens clothes, and for offerings; human blood, whilst Mylitta required women in men’s garments, and the prositution of their bodies; hence “the names of the hetairæ Melitta, Meleto, Milto, Milesia,” and the name of the African province, “Megas-Melita, ‘the tent of Mylitta.’ ” The high priest of Apollo, was the Kurios tōn Melissōn, and the priestesses of Demeter were Melissæ, which later peoples, trying to explain, con-nected with bees and honey, and said they were nymphs, and that Melissa was a name for Selene. Melia was also the name of a daughter of Oceanus or Ok-ean, who plunged into Haliakmon: Marseilles was called after Melissa metamorphosed into Massilia, by a Phocian colony, from whom Gauls learned her name and attributes; these they long revered, and only ceased to worship when the virgin mother of a new deity 1 Forbes Leslie’s Early Races, p. 93. 2 Myths of Middle Ages, pp. 495, 496. 3 Ibid., p. 497, and Plut.

Melisa still haunts the shores of Bretony as the Venus of Quimperle,1 and as Triton, Siren, or Mermaid is still well known among moat of the illiterate races of Europe. In 1492, Bothe mentions that “a god Krodo is worshipped in the Hartz, having his feet on a fish, a wheel in one hand and a pail of water in the other”2—clearly a Vishnoo or Fishnoo solar deity, carrying the solar or lunar disk, and the ark or womb of fertility. These Fish-Gods, as Mr. Baring Gould states in the case of the Mexican Kox-Kox or Teokipaktli, i.e. Fish-God, much resemble the Old Testament Noah, for Kox encountered a flood, and “rescued himself in a cypress trunk (a true phallic symbol), and peopled the world with wise and intelligent beings.” His full title mixes him up with “the Flesh-God”-idea of Hebrews and others, vide Vot I., pp. 197-8; see also index, “Fish,” for his full name, is “the Fish-God of our flesh.” North American Indians relate that they too followed a Fish-man or demi-god from Asia; he was only a man from the breasts up-wards, below he was a fish, or, indeed, two fish, for each leg was a separate fish. The Rev. Baring Gould, in his interesting but I fear, to many, scarcely innocuous volume, (for millions are yet sunk in the superstitions he describes with scarcely any attempt at refutation or explanation), says that it is “a study of no orddinary interest to trace modern popular Protestantism back to the mythologic systems, of which it is the resultant. . . . 3 The early fathers made a great mistake in fancying that the ancient heresies were bastard forms of Christianity; they were distinct religions, feebly tinged by contact\" with Christianity. This no one can help seeing if he will carefully peruse the long lists of so-called “Heresies,” which Hippolytus, Bishop of Rome,4 pro-fesses to refute, but does not. “Under the name of Methodism,” continues Gould, “we have (amongst us) the old Druidic religion still alive, energetic, and possibly more vigorous than it was, when it exercised a spiritual supremacy over the whole of Britain. With the loss of the British tongue, much of the old terminology has died out and a series of adaptations to Christianity has taken place, without radically affecting the system. . . . Those who have made the fragments of Bardic religious poems, and the scheme of Druidic rites their study, cannot fail with astonishment to note the remark-able coincidence which exists between modern Wesleyanism, and the religion of our British forefathers”5—language, perhaps, a little too strong, and which applies more to many very low church dissenting sects than to those the Ritualist clergyman of the State Chureh mentions. The “revivalist,” “new birth,” “conversion,” or “regenera-tion” doctrines of many so-called Evangelical sects, not to say those of Mrs Girling’s class, are very old in the history and practices of religion.

Thus “the ideas of a prophet and madman are closely connected,” and Plato is said to have affirmed, perhaps cynically, that no one in possession of his senses ever obtained the gift of divination. Accordingly, many good as well as worth-less men, sought after this “spiritual illumination,” and tried, by rigid austerities and asceticism, privation and self-mortiftcation, by living in desert places amidst squalor and filth, as well as by mutilation, scourgings, and even narcotics and maddening drugs, to induce the supernatural element which was to enable them “to see God,” and be accounted holy by Him. as well as in the eyes of all men. Boodha and all fanatics have more or less, at one time of their career, so acted, and hence the “temptations” in the forests of Boodha Gaya, and in the deserts around Jerusalem and Meka. In this way Brahmans rose to be “the twice born ones;” and the priests of Kaldia, Egypt, and Irān, no less than the Druids of Europe, became most exeptionally “holy,” and have been followed by sorcerers, “medicine men,” soothsayers, seers, and saints, nay, by so called “wise men,” who thought they communed with Jehovah and his angels, and obtained their prescience and even guidance by stars, which left their heavenly courses to point out to them the affairs of their small planet. So the Jewish and Christian Bible teaches that “God spake to Israel in visions . . . . . if there be a prophet among you, I, the Lord, will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream;” and thus when worn out with fasting, and with nerves unstrung by midnight wandering in desert places, Christ and Mahomed said, they had visions of God and angels; no doubt, the visions of Zacharias, Paul, and Peter, were due to the same abnormal and ecstatic states. The Christian Church has con-tinued these ideas in various ways, and still holds with Plotinus, the “Pagan leader” 1 Springfield, Mass., Sunday School Convention. See Boston Index, 11th May 1876, where a good article on this so-called “Spiritual Illumination” occurs, to which I am somewhat indebted."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 243of this emotional school of the third century A.C., that be a miraculous regeneration or ecstasy, “the soul becomes loosened from its material prison; separated from indi-vidual consciousness, and absorbed in the infinite intelligence from which it emanated. In this ecstasy it contemplates real existence; and identifies itself with that which it contemplates. This may be attained,” continued the Pagan, “through the influence of rapturous and inspiring music, profound and intent thought, the spiritual elevation of pure love, and devotion, or prayer.” Such was the new Platonic school which inculcated continual sorrow for our bodily or material condition; Plotinus reviled the body, and scowled upon his friends for asking for a portrait of him. He became, what some would call, “regenerated” tat his twenty-eighth year, falling into a state of extreme pious anxiety, in which he remained till his thirty-ninth year, when his intellect reaaserted itself under the study of Indian and Persian philosophies.1 He still, however, maintained very abetemious habits, rarely touching flesh, and so trying to attain unto “great religious insight and spiritu-ality.” Porphry, his disciple, said that he had raised his soul to a wonderful contem-plation and realisation of a supreme and personal God, but one who was yet to him, un-corporeal, and far beyond man’s thoughts and imagination; “four times by a transcendent energy of soul,” he says, “did Plotinus rise to a perfect union with God, whilst he, Porphyry, during a life of sixty-eight years, only once attained this elevation.” On his death-bed, Plotinus took leave of his best friend, saying, “Now I seek to lead back the divine principle within me, to the God who is all in all;” and on this, says his excited friend,” a dragon glided from under the bed and escapes through an opening in the wall”—a spirit-vehicle which is, by Christians, likened to a dove, but whieh I have heard described by truthful but too excitable persons as seen in the form of a pale van-ishing light! The mystics of our middle ages, nay, down to the seventeenth century, spoke and wrote strongly regarding supernatural “gifts of God,” which no “carnally minded men” could attain to, and this is strictly in keeping with a firm belief in con-tinual miracles and ghostly manifestations; with a belief in “the descent of the Holy Ghost,” the speaking in divers tongues “as the spirit giveth utterance,” the drinking of poison and taking up of deadly snakes without hurt, &c., but not in keeping with the intellectual part of our nature, reason, or common sense. All nations or peoples have, at some stage of their growth, held similar views, and more or less similarly manifested them; they are not necessarily borrowed from others, but are common to our nature at certain stages of civilisation. With like circumstances and climate, there will naturally be produced almost exactly the same phases in religious rites and symbols, and so the Lamahism of Tibet is not necessarily nor probably the parent of the many like rites and emblems we see so common in Roman Catholicism. But we have unduly digressed from our immediate theme. It is difficult to know by what names the very early races of our islands usually 1 Smith’s Dic. of G. and R. Biog. [See also Porphyry, Vit.

The following deities were most common, and it will help us grasp much that follows if we bear this in mind:— THE SUN, or APOLLO; Bel or Be-al, Hu or Hea, the Bull God, Siva or Apis. The Sun was called by Kelts indifferently, Bel—Be-al—Bel—Belus—Belenus Beal—Beil—Beul, “God of Life” (Gaelic). In Ceylon Sa-beanism is called Bali-ism, and Bali signifies “manly strength.” VENUS URANIA, or VAROONA, OURANOS, Cuba or Cybele. Gwen or Astarte, like the Phenician Urania, was symbolized by rude roundish stones, or the sculptured “elephant” seen in Keltik remains.1 MINERVA or DIANA, Artemis, Asteria. The great protectress of the Tyrian and Etruscan seamen. The Ashēraor “Grove” of O.T. was a wooden goddess, but not of human figure. MARS, Veteres or Vetus. Vitukadrus or Bitukadrus. Probably the Spear (Quiris), Arrow, or Shaft. Vetus was a Stone-God like Petra or Tsur. TARANIS. A cruel goddess like Kāli or Doorga, with a great shrine at Taurisin Getæ;she was a sister of Phebus, and had an alter reeking with human gore, chiefly of strangers, whom she most coveted. HESUS. Was a deity requring human sacrifices; possibly gods in general, under the term Esus, or “The Æsar.” ANNAT, or ANAIT. This was HEKATE, ARTEMIS, or NANIA; or if male, MAO, or MANI, the moon; seems to be the Tanat, Tanith, or Tanas of Punic monu-ments. Ruins of temples to An-Aitor “Ana of Wells,” still exist near to lakes and holy wells. Ceres and Proserpine are Cerid-wen and Llywy, but Anat is the Ana or Anea of Western Asia; her altar was the same as that of Omanus and Anadatus, or Andate. She was worshipped, like Artemis or Upis (that is Ophis, her earliest name), with very obscene rites; her symbols were citcles, crescents, serpents with tail in mouth, &c. She was often Ked (Ceres), wife of Hu, the Bull God. JUPITER, PLUTO, NEPTUNE. Di, Dis, Dei, Dwe, &c., God in general. There were about 80 Joves. MERCURY, HERMES, or the Pillar God, Tor, TA, TOTH or LINGAM. These are various names for Zeus, or God, “The Fructifier.” Tutales or Toth, god of art, trade, and travellers; also of secrecy, robbery, and villany. Like Siva, he loved human sacrifices. As Ta, Tor, or TUISCO he was the greatest of gods, and general ruler of all things. Jove, Toth or Jahveh moved in the sun and fire, in the thunder and tempest, and amidst the oaks of the forest—his favourite dwelling-place; he was in the light, and the circle or disk and the weird mass or columnal rock or mountain, all alike represented him. The Belgæ preferred, at the dawn of Christianity, to worship him in fire only; but fire is Mithra, who is Osiris, who is Priapus, Hermes, and Siva;2 and hence we are told that Kelts and Swevi then saw in him the pythic Sun, because, says Polwhele, the circle and serpent were held symbolical of the god of the world; his “was the inherent wisdom which so issuing; illuminated the seats of animation, and made all prolific; he is the pole of the circle, the mover and mutator of all.” IDRIS AND ST MI-KAL.—In Southern England two names occur in later days which seem to have somewhat replaced Taut—Idris the Giant, and Michael the Arch-angel.

MICHAEL’S MOUNT, LAND’S END ent countries, but usually in or near to water, as in Armorika, Apulis, and on the sacred islet cone of St. Michael, where Romans as well as Phenicians seem to have thickly congregated. Idris, Edres, or Hydres, is believed to have been a great navi-gator, and according to the Arabians a Sabean. The highest peak in Wales is called after him Kader Idris, or “Chair of Idris,” and “at its foot are three gigantic stones called Tri-grienyn,” or “the three Sun-stones,” confirming what has been said above as to lingams being Sun-stones, or emblems of Mithra the fertilizer, a deity whose worship was here very popular.1 Mr Davies and the author of Hermes Britanicus agree that Idris was the same as Hermes (p. 89), and upon his mount, St. Michael had also a chair—the Keltish euphemism for Ark, or Womb. Though an “angel of the Most High,” nay, often an incarnation of “Him who maketh alive and destroyeth”—Siva—yet he was also a veritable person, for a pious writer—William of Worcestor, gravely informs us that “St. Michael’s second appearance was in 710 A.C. on the tomb of Cornwall near the sea;” “tomb” being an old name for a “mountain rising up like a vast barow,” and also for a holy shrine. Siva has many names signifying his con-nection with death as well as life, the grave as well as the cradle. The author of Universal History sees “Toth of Death” in in the name of the Phallic shrine at Tad-mor, Teuth-mort or Teut-mor, but this is deriving the older from the younger! More probably Mor or Mort is from Mard, man; so that Teut or Tot, Mord, would mean the man or manly-god, par excellence; but Western Sivas also ruled at death. Toth or Mercury, like Yama of India, conducted the dead of Egypt to their long home, and hence Toth appears on the tombs with the symbol of life or immortality—the Crux Ansata of Egypt and Linga-Yoni of India. If the new archangel of Christendom was thought to reside in a “Mons Tumba,” —Fig. 249—on an islet cone of the Cornish coast, so was he seen hy Apulians and Daunians in “the Spur of Italy”—the isolated cone of Mons Garganus; whilst Iber-ians said he was the “Rock of Ages,” and artfully enclosed him in that fine old Spanish-Christian shrine called “The Hermitage of St. Michael,” which is given in my Plate XV. There he stands in his dual form as the Tsur or Rock-god, and the Arkangel with Trident Sceptre. The stones are clearly an old Dolmen where Basques or Iernes had worshipped from unknown times; it lies near Arichinaga, in the province of Biscay, some twenty-four miles from Bilboa, probably at the bold cape we see marked “C. Machichaco,” for personally I do not know the locale of this extraordinary Christo-Sivaik shrine. Mr. Fergusson gives us a sketch of it, from F. Leslie’s Illustrated News, calling the church in which is the Maha-kal and his two holy stones, “The Dolmen of St Miguel.”2 As Chris- tianity only penetrated into the Asturias after 720, Mr. Fergusson thinks the 1 Lon.

The learned writer does not, in reference to such monuments, acquit the Christians there or else-where of their “love of stones,” but urges that there was here full reason why the Councils of Toledo should fulminate decrees in 681 and 692 against the “Veneratores lapidum,”1 and hence argues that up to the time when such Christian temples were built over these Phallic symbols, they must have been not only very sacred in the eyes of all but have been actually worshipped. This is undoubted, and it goes to prove that the Jews on Mount Moriah, and after them the builders of that fine “Mosk of Omer” over the sacred Sakra, or rude “Tomb of the Rock” and Well, were equally devoted to “Stones” up to the ascendancy of Mahomedanism; moreover, though thus bringing down the Solo-Phallic faith to so late a period, it in no degree curtails its vast antiquity. On the other hand, it demonstrates that Christianity has been a plant of very slow, unequal, and uncertain growth, often weak and straggling, and a mere omnium gatherum of old faiths; indeed, that which the educated pious ones of Eng-land call Christianity, has never yet penetrated a hundredth part of the popu- lation of Europe, and it has been said that its leading doctrines are as entirely un-known to probably several millions of the district and suburban masses of this “fourth quarter” of the globe, as they are in the city of Benares. In many cases the faith is but a name and gloss on the surface of society—a brightening up or polish, as it were, better known in church-going and outward symbols, than in theses and doctrines. The surface of Europe has been washed, as it were, with holy water, as priests under the advice of Pope Gregory, washed “the sacred stones of the Pagans” when turning them into sacred Christian objects.2 We have a writing, reading, and religious population of very small extent, and an illiterate mass of enormous proportions, this even in well-instructed Scotland, where every child goes to some school, and all schools teach as the principal part of all education, the Bible and catechisms. From Dr. Norman Macleod’s “Journals” we learn that he received the following answers from two intending communicants when he was minister of the Barony Parish, Glasgow, “illustrating,” he says, “the fact which has often been impressed on me respecting the possibility of persons being regular in church all their lives, and yet remaining ignornnt of the simplest truths:— ‘Who led the children out of Egypt?—Eve. Who was Eve?—The mother of God. What death did Christ die?—(After a long time) Hanged on a tree. What did they do with the body?—Laid it in a manger. What did Christ do for sinners?—Gave his son. Any wonderful works Christ did?—Made the world in six days. Any others?—Buried Martha, Mary and Lazarus. What became of them afterwards?—Angels took them to Abraham’s bosom. What had Christ to do with that?—He took Abraham. Who was Christ?—The Holy Spirit. Are you a sinner? 1 Rude Stone Monuments, pp. 24, 388. 2 Fergusson, Op. Cit., p. 389."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 247—No. Did you never sin, and do you love God perfectly?—Yes.’ ”1 Now, these were answers by two persons specially educated up to their subject in religious Scotland, and if they were so perfectly ignorant of the whole faith, in its essentials as well as de-tails, it is absurd to call Europe, Christian; indeed, my own impression, produced by travelling from time to time over all Europe, and making somewhat minute inquiries, is, that as a whole, the mass of the poople are far more grossly ignorant of their faith than Dr. Norman Macleod’s “Communicants.” As to the history or origin of Christianity, or of the books which—bound together, they call their Bible, they have seldom the remotest conception, and of their authors, the sequence of events, or general history, scarcely a notion. It may and does suit, to call such persons Christians, but, except for purposes of government or politics, it in no way expresses more than that they sub-mit to the nomenclature—it is not a fact in the light we are at present considering, viz., the growth of properly understood beliefs or creeds. The two sacred stones in the Basque shrine of St. Miguel are no solitary strangers in Europe; many old churches have strange histories of sacred altar and corner-stones, pillars, tombs or sarcophagi, &c.2 Mr Fergusson mentions another Christian church at Cangas de Onis in the Asturias, forty miles from Ovideo, built on a mound, which con-tains in it a dolmen of significant structure—IOnic, with a Cella, at the head of a vagina-like pasage. This dolmen, says Fergusson, has always served as a crypt, and he argues that: “Had the Christians merely wanted a foundation for their building. they would have filled up or destroyed the Pagan edifice, but it seems to have remained open to the present day; and though it has long ceased to be used for any sacred pur-pose, it still is, and always was an essential part of the Church which it supported.”3 Thus has the one faith built upon the other, and this from the earliest times to the present day. Many indeed assert that without the old faith—phallic and stone though it was, we should never have had the present, all being growths, and one ever dovetailing into the other; so the race goes on rubbing out only where it has some-thing to put in; even the masses, conservative though they be, are ever moving on, and different this year to what they were last, and immensely changed to what they were some generations back. To assure himself of this, let the reader turn to Plates IX., X., and XI., pp. 72, 168, and 212, and he will there see the Gods which Europe and our own ancestors worshipped, down to but a few centuries ago; it would have been as certain death to have injured them then, as to maltreat the symbols of Hindoo-Benares at present. Need we wonder then at seeing French, Basque and Spanish, nay, all Christians, building their shrines oveer such sacred stones, or at our forefathers quarrel-ling as to whose dead sbould lie nearest to their phallic Pur-tors like that in Pl. X., Fig. I. on the headland of Clonmacknoise.

The other figures in this No. 250, are partially treated of at page 224 of Vol. I. Fig. VIII, of Plate X., though a Lingam temple, and containing no less precious a phallus than the Helio-agatha-belus of the Roman Empire, was called “The temple of Venus of Emesa,” and it would sem from the Section, that the idea was to make her Ark or crescent, as boat-like as possible. Looking at Plates IX., X., and XI., as a whole, what a strange world-wide collec-tion of male and female forms do we see! Amongst our forefathers and neighbours, Sardinia competes with Alsace, Bretony and Ireland, in Lingma, and Stirlingshire with Midlothian in Yoni forms, which last symbols, those desiring progeny, health and happiness were directed, where possible, to pass themselves through. For Lingaites, from the rolling sands of Armorika to those of Tatary, strange protuberances, such as are seen in Plate IX.-XI. were given for cognate purposes. Everywhere we see the Baa1-Berith whom “Israel went a whoring after,” as the writer of Judges viii. 33 coarsely states; and it, Bagster’s annotator informs us, is “Mer- cury or Jupiter Federis,” that Maha Deva on whom Lingaites, swore, as did Yonites on the “holed stones.” Enough, the reader should study the plates closely for himself; let us return to St. Michael and congenital deities and shrines. There are four great archangels which the world has at different times and under various forms accepted as Maha-Kāls or Great Sivas, viz., the Michael of Christians, which we may pronounce soft as Miha-El or “Great El;” Uriel or Ur-i-El, the “god of Light” or of Urites; Suriel or Soor-i-El, “the Solar god,” and Gabriel, Abri-el or Abi-el, the “Father” or “Generator.”1 The Michael or archangel of Jahveh, corresponds to the Gabriel of Ala, and is a god of “Tumbas,” caves or arks, wielding a rod, or Tri-Sool which we see him holding as he stands betwixt the two stones in the Spanish Christian shrine, truly there, a god of the stones of testimony—a Westem Siva, which every Sivaite wonld welcome and humbly pay his vows before. He is, they say, “a gra-cious Lord,” when humbly and fervently sought, an Al-Wahāb, or giver of fortune and abundance, for without Mahakal, the labourer laboureth in vain; the fig-tree can-not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive, shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat, the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in. the stalls. Such also was the ancient Deity Il-Mekah, the Lunar ‘Abri-El of Meka, that eponymous Shrine of the Sabean Ark.2 His Mons Tomba of Europe 1 [Most of these derivations are spurious.

Müller, two thousand years ago as Bel-erians, and as having a very sacred shrine on a strange half-insulated cone. The peak is 200 feet high, and 660 in diameter at base, and corresponds in appear-ance, character, and mythology, with all other Mons. St. Michaels, including that on the Norman headland; both were famous for apparitions of the Saint. On the Armori-kan Mount, Autbert, bishop of Avranches. built in 708 A.C., a church and monastery in close imitation of that of St. Michael on lofty Garganus in Apulla, a Christian shrine known since 493 A.C., and the successor of far older ones; for enfolded in dense forests of oak, the ancicnt Pagan MAHA-KAL had here his throne, at a height of 5120 feet above the sea, watching over the whole level eastern coast, from “the heel” of Italy to Ancona. The faith-ideas of these St. Michaels are ever the same. Müller writes: “In physical structnre there is a curious resemblance between the two mountains (St. Michel in Normandy and St. Michael of Cornwall). Both are granite islands, and both so near the coasts that at low water, a dry pasaage is open to them from the mainland. The mount on the Norman coast is larger and more distant from the coast than St. Michael’s Mount, yet for all that, their general likeness is very striking. Now Mont St. Michel was called Tumba, at least as far back as the tenth century,” and this recognised name has “survived to the present day. The church and monastery there, were called ‘in monte Tumba’ or ‘ad duas Tumbas,’ there being in reality two islands, the principal one called Tumba, the smaller Tumbella or Tumbellana.”2 Thus the shrines of M’Kael, or Mahā-Kal, are Rocks, Tombs, or Caves in Mountains, for these were the “secret places of the Most High”—Mithras or Siva the Sun-God—and universal characteristics of a solar god; so one of his oldest Keltik names here was the “Careg Cowse” or “Rupis Cana,”3 the hoary whitey-grey, or ancient rock—the Tsur Oulamin,4 or “Rock of Ages,” names given, and most appropriate to him, “The Rock,” who dwelleth on the lofty white cones of Kailās. Our philologist here will not admit the usually received translation of the Cornish description of Michael as “the Cara Clowse in Cowse,” “The hoare Rock in the Wodd,” but proves satisfactorily that this should be Cara Cowz in Clowse, “The 1 Max Müller’s Chips, III. xv.; Diod. viii. v. 22. 2 Ibid., III. 340-42. 3 Ibid., p. 336.   4 Isaiah xxvi. 4.

Both are Sun-Gods and Deities of Stones, Rocks, and Caves, so that he of “the Tomb of the Rock” is appro-printely called by Hebrews the Tsur—“Rock, or stock which begat them.” The Latin poets also, it must be rememhered, used rupes in the sense of “a cave,”2 in which case the name of Michael’s shrine becomes “the Ancient Cave of Caves.” We may, how-ever, fully accept the older name Tum-ba or Tum-bella, that is, Tomb of the Sun or of Solar Worshippers; for, says Max Müller, “this name Tumbellana was after- wards changed into tumba Helenæ”—the sacred cave of the Hellenes or Sun wor-shippers. It “gave rise,” he adds, “to various legends about Elaine, one of the heroines of the Arthurian cycle—nay, the name was cited by learned antiquarians as a proof of the ancient worship of Belus.”3 Now here seems to be the root of the whole matter, and as usual, the ancient term is the interpreter. Tum-ba is equivalent to Michel, and a contraction for Tum-bal, Tum-bel, or Tumb-Elenæ, the Cave or Tomb of Elaine Arthyr, or Uthyr—the Sun, the conical God of Fertility, the wielder of the Tri-dent, Crux Ansata or cross, and the Ruler of Arks. It will be advisible, before going deeper into Keltik lore, Tumbas, circles, and sacred places, to here lay before the reader some general defintions and explanations as to what these are, or what is usually com-prehended under some of the various names now common among archeologists. DOLMENS AND KROMLECHS.—The KROMLECH of Scotland is a Gromlech in Wales, and in Bretony a Dolmen or Tol-Maen, said to be from Tol, a hole or aperture, which is either in one of the stones, or constructed by so laying these, that a crevice or Crick (the Cornish name) be formed, for those seeking purification or regeneration to pass through—an essentially Yonish idea. From there being usually one tabular stone resting on others, Tol was thought, says Müller,4 to come from tabula, a table, necessarily connected in the mind with an altar—a purpose to which no doubt the flat stone was often put; the error was the usual classic one, which makes Latin the senior tongue! Dealbh is a statue,5 so that Deal-Men = “Statue Stone,” and Dail = Dol, in old Gaelic “a stone,” but this last would make Tol-Maen “a Stone Stone”—rather meaninghless unless “a Stone of Stones.” The meaning is either the “Hold, Standing or Statue Stone,” both characteristic of the Faith and its votaries. Though human remains have been found in Dolmens, yet they or their immediate vicinity, were for the most part merely places for sacrifices and offerings, and their site, whether in Europe or India, was in a circle, or sacred grove, and near to a “Holy Well,” ghāt, or river crossing; they were also erected over “Earth-fast rocks” or “Mounts of Sacrifice.” 1 From Cornish Cara or Carak, a Rock; Cowz, Cos, or Coth, old; Armorikan, Kleus, Kiōs, an enclosure or tomb; Gaelic, Cladh; Cornish, Cladhea; Welsh, Clowdh, also burying-place. 2 Smith’s Latin Dic. 3 Chips, III. p. 342. 4 Ibid., III., 292. 5 In the Gaelic Bible, Rachel’s “Images”! bh is mute, and vowels very elastic, see p. 340."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 251In Keltik dialects, Krom came to be a “circle,” and lech or leach is a slab, stone, or “place;” but by a Kromlech was signified a suspended or sacred sloping stone in a holy enclosure, though in current Gaelic a Kromlech is merely a leaning slab. A Krom-leach was anciently, says General Vallency, an erect stone around which others have been cast (forming, in fact, a phallus and testes), or two such stones capped by a third; Curr-am-leach signifies “the stone cast about,” and Carrig-curra, “the rock to be cast at.”1 This last is “generally placed erect on elevated grounds, . . . on the tops of Karns, or artificial mounds. . . . or in the middle of a circle of stones, when it is names Kir-am-leach (in Cork, Carig-a-phouka), or the fircle about the stone.” “A third species of Kromleach is a large stone of a rude pyrimidal form, placed on three others. The Karrig-kurrn is undoubtedly the \\rh tyb (Beth-aram) of the Canaanites,2 and Bit Kolis (sylq), or Mercury of Kaldia,” whose name in Ireland is Coll or Tait, and in Kaldia Mercolis (sylqrm). In “Proverbs,” “The fool” is he who throws stones to the God of Stones of Hermes,3 a practice still common all over Asia. Mercury in Kaldi and Arabic was called Katub, or “the writer;” for on stones—usually plastered by Jews—all real learning was transcibed. Still we see the source of the name: for in Kaldi, Kata is it “an upright stone” or rock—clearly the source of Cautes in Latin, Cote and Cyte in Saxon; and, says Vallency, probably the origin of the otherwise unmeaning name Kit-kothy, or Koity, given to the Kentish stone—once, no doubt, a Kistvaen, and with an enclosure or grove which Koit or Koet sig-nifies in Cornish and Armorikan. Ket or Ked is Ceres, the Ark, Kist or box.4 Hermes or Siva was the thrower or “Projector” whether of stones or javelines, for which Sciots or Scots were famous, see p. 209; and in Phenicia Bit-haram was the “place or emblem of the Projector or Creator,” and was said, by those who consider Keltik the younger language, to be derived from Rema (amr), to throw or project. The Jewish rite of “heave offerings” to the Sun at harvest time may be connected with throwing stones to Hermes, a practice Mahomed countenanced in the Valley of Arafat. The Laps also throw stones to one they call the “God of Heaps,” or Jumula,5 equivalent to Acervus (a heap), and the Galeed and Gilgal of the Hebrew. Hermes is said by some to be derived from the Kaldi amyro, Gorema or Oremah, often pronounced Harema or Harma, or Garma; so a heap in Latin is Grumus; Gall., Grumean; Sax. Cramman; Anglice, Cram, Krom or Karn.6 “A Charam Louach” (jwlmrj) is the devoted, covenant, or consecrated stone, the Irish Krom Kruach or Aesar, the Creator —the Asher or Jasher (rcy) of Kaldians and Phenicians; and Eswar, Aes, &c., of Aryans, which Western Kelts hardened into such terms as Ather and Agger. Thus in Dorset we have the celebrated Ather, Agger, or holy Agyle-stone standing by a once 1 Hist. of Ancient Ireland, IV. 479, and Anct. Faiths, I. 343.

Even if we incline to look to Ag, “Fire,” as the derivation of Agger, the Solo-phallic signification remains the same. KISTVAENS.—The Kistvaen, Kist-mean or Kist-men, is a stone-chest, with usu-ally three sides of one or more stones, and a covering slab, all rudely fitted to- gether, though, unless of a comparatively modern date, rarely touched by a tool. Occasionally Kistvaens, Maen-Kyds, Men or Stone Arks, that is of Ceres, are wholly closed, or have only a hole in one of the side slabs. In the cell are usually some human remains, ashes in urns, or charred bones and wood; also arms, bells, and personal orna-ments—all of which, though generally denoting some considerable age, does not neces-sarily do so everywhere; I have myself seen those we call “Indian Aborigines” so de-positing the remains of their dead ones. On and around such holy spots also, sacred trees are planted and stones erected, especially monoliths for males, and rotund or ovate blocks for highly-honoured females. None the less is the monolith here a Hermes, or the off-spring of the old Hermaic idea; for here too he is the God of Vows and Consecrations, these being the spots where the family or tribe usually ratify their moot solemn vows. It is Hermes, Kid (Cyd) or their emblems, the presence of which consecrates alike the cave, the tomb, the grove, the solitary tree, nay, the desolate hill-top or dready moor-land, as well as the garden, field, and domicile, though moderns have veiled these in artistic statuary, and so lost sight of the old idea. All these places were the early churches of mankind, where “Divine rites were first celebrated, and the sublime precepts of philosophy first taught,”1 wrote the Rev. Mr Maurice, and few knew the Eastern and Westem world better than he. It is a common idea that sacrificial rites were performed on the tops of K i s t -v a e n s, and this is no doubt correct in the cas8e of many, especially where the D o l m e n , as a “statue,” table, stone or earth-fast block or rock, like that in Fig. 31, p. 91, Vol. I., was not available; for the Dolmen site was the orthodox place for sacrifices and is so still. I have stood by and witnessed such sacrificial rites on Dolmen-like tables and “Earth-fast rocks,” very frequently and over all India, from its most southern shores to the Himalayas; on its Western confines, where the Araveli ranges hold back the desolating sands of Western Rajpootana, and Eastward among the dark Kayen races of Boodhistic Barma, where the Yoma-Toung bouuds the Indian Ocean, as well as amidst the fair-complexioned Karens and Shans who inhabit the high hills and dense forests which fonn the extreme East of our Indian Empire. The place of sacrifice should be not only near to the emblematic God or Goddess, but may even be on the Hermes himself, if large enough, and hence we often see in painting or sculpture a sacrificial rite being performed on large Lingam-like Stones. Human sacrifice was a holy rite of great virtue, and. to impale or crucify the victim, especially if a criminal or heretic to the Faith, on a pole, pale,2 cruciform or 1 Indian Anti., II. 8, and His. of Hindostan. 2 It is a Stauros or “Pale” in N.

So Athena the Virgin presided on the Akro-Polis of Athenes, and Mother Ceres at Argos and Elusinia; and Keltik shrines, more ancient probably than these, proclaim the same custom. The Ark of the Keltik Alma-Mater was the Men-Ark or Men-Kyd,2 and it occupied the centre of the stone circle probably as often as the Maha-Deva. Max Müller, quoting Dr. Borlase,3 says, “Some stone circles have other distinguishing pro-perties. In or near the centre stands a stone taller than the rest, as at Boscawen-un; in the middle of others a Kist-vaen. A Cromlêh distinguishes the centre of some circles, and one remarkable rock that of others.” And we may not therefore doubt that an Ark or “Cromlêh” marked the shrine of the Vishnooites, and the “one remarkable rock,” that of Yahveh, the “Rock of Ages”—that chief object of a Sivaite’s adoration. The two Gods are often seen in the same sanctuary as a Sri-Linga, or Yoni and Lingam, see various figures in these volumes, noted below.4 We have in rude times only the emblems, as Bel or Peor and the Grove or Ashera, “the men-an-tol or holed stone of Lanyon, &c.” which Max Müller describes as “flanked by two other stones standing erect on each side,” reminding us of the Astarte of Elia Capitolina, where she is an ovicular stone betwixt two cypresses or evergreen phalli, vide my Plate XVI. This was improved upon by the artistic Greeks in their beautiful statues of Zeus and Juno, and was afterwards somewhat spiritualized in the Christs and Marys of Christian Europe. I was not aware, when writing regarding the Stonehenge Pointer (p. 232), that the flankers of the Lanyon men-an-tol, fulfilled a similar Solar purpose. “About the time of the autumnal equinox,” writes Müller, “the observer will see that the shadow thrown by the erect stone, would fall straight through the hole of the men- an-tol,”5 which proves that the circle of Stonehenge is but a Men-an-tol, and therefore correctly depicted in my Fig. 32. p. 281 of Vol. I. Yet strangely enough we are often asked to see only astronomical observatories in these ancient shrines, and this in spite of the still continued holy fear, if not reverence, with which, in so many places they are held by even the Kelts of these educated days. Max Müller himself tells us, only a few pages before suggesting the Observatory theory, that at Trereen in Cornwall it is currently believed that a whole family—the Jans—became extinct entirely owing to their “sacreligious act” of removing a menhir or garaksan, 1 Cf.

I insert here another plate—No. XII.—as exhibiting some very good samples of the Lingaik and Yonik worship of olden times. Stones of both types are here,— those which no tool hath “polluted,” as the Sivaite circles 9 and 11, and the trilithic Dolmen No. 8, and a Men-an-tol or the constructed Yoni stone of Kerles-cant. Fig. 4, a part of the wall of the very ancient city of Alatri, is given as showing the building capabilities of the old races who nevertheless in worship, used these unhewn, primeval blocks of atone, and Figs. 2, 3, 6, 10, and 12 are some of the reliquaries which have been frequently found in their shrines, kestvaens, tumuli, barrows, etc. No. 12 is evidently the same feminine idea as we see in the very old figures of the Astarte of Naxos and Sardinia, Plate X., 2 and 6. The “bell and cone charm” is still a favourite which Etrurian maids innocently wear suspended beside the modern cross and ancient phallos. The Etruskan phallic helmet, with its strange double serpent, reminds us of the head-dress of Isis or Serapis (Fig. 181, p. 501, Vol I.); the plan of Avebury (Fig. 246, p. 233), or the sacred hieroglyphs in Fig. 233, p. 166. It has degenerated into that Sri-Linga-like hat, No. 1 of this Plate, closely corresponding to the royal Asyrian hats, Fig. 211, p. 80. Fig. 5 of this plate—an Indian Phallic light tower—is not an uncom-mon object near tombs; and is one of the very best ideagraphs we can have of Siva as Ar, Ur, or “Light;” it ia situated on the usual pediment, such as we see the Lingam of Innis Murray standing upon in Fig. 183, p. 485, Vol. I. MENHIRS.—The term Menhirs is derived from the two Keltik words Men, a great stone, and Hir, long. Smaller ones were “Pulven,” and two together, with one across (see Fig. 177, p. 456 of Vol. 1, and elsewhere), a Licha-ven. Menhirs were simply Long-men, Long-Adāms, or Phalli, possibly the German Huran, which modern Scotchmen call, in complete ignorance of the meaning, Hare or even “Hair stones,” for not being artificially formed—as all things must be in these days, their significance and Heaven-born character is misunderstood; yet readers of the Penta-teuch and students of Palla-Diums should know better. BARROWS.—The word Barrow is the ordinary name for a kind of tumulus, and probably comes from Borra, “a prominence;” Barr, “a top,” and Borpa, a loose, conical heap; but more hereafter of these Keltik derivations. Most Barrows contain remains of bodies, buried or cremated, and sometimes whole skeletons, often in stone cists. The centre and a passage to these, are usually sustained by wood work, and occasionally there is a well constructed entrance faced with stone, and round the base, rows of monoliths with a pillar or Lingam over all. This as in the case of the tombs, though probably intended only to consecrate the whole, yet none the less constitutes a Sri-Linga—Omphe and Lingam; see the Stonehenge idea, Vol. I., p. 281; Head of Serpent, Loch Nell, p. 288; the Karnak Tumulus, p. 302; Kalarnish Circle, Pl. VIII., 7, p. 386; and, of modern structures, St. Peter’s of Rome, etc. 1 Op. Cit., p. 292, and cf. 294.   2 Gen. xx. 25."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 255TUMULI are divided into chambered and unchambered, sepulchral and non-sepul-chral, and have for the most part animal remains and very commonly human. They are usually classified under their two ordinary forms, circular, or elongated, the latter being called by Kelts Borād or “protuberances,” which last have generally cells similar to those in pyramids and many eastern tombs. It is difficult to say whether the cells were meant for the living or dead, for in many cases they look like subterranean temples, or places intended to shelter the familes of a tribe in times of trouble; but the living may have been immured here, and the darkest crimes committed with impunity. The Barrow and Tumulus are then archeologically different. KAIRNS or KARNS.—of karns, though already much dwelt upon we must say a few special words here. They are Hermaik heaps of stones, often perhaps raised where barrows were impossible, either from the stony nature of the country or from want of tools and skill to construct earthworks. We see the best descriptive sample of the karn and its raison d’être in that “Heap” raised by Jacob and Laban for the proper consecration of their vow to Jahveh. The foundation of this karn was first a pillar (verse 45), then a Galeed, Acervus, or as we call such in the east, a Janāla, for Jacob first “took a stone and set it up for a pillar,” or lingam, and then “said unto his brethren, ‘Gather stones.’ And they took stones and made an heap, and they did eat there upon the heap, and Laban called it Iegar Shadouta (the Mount of Witness) but Jacob called it Galeed.” And mark, that after a most important oath of full phallic significance and form, “they offered sacrifice upon this mount, . . . . . . and did eat bread (clearly a eucharistic repast), and tarried all night in the mount”1—Hebrew băhăr, a form of our eastern word parh or pahar, “the hill,” and foundation of the name of Par-vati the consort of “the Pillar- God.” The mound, karn, tumulus, omphe, or hill have here all the same sacred and phallic significance, and I would thus dispose of the fine distinction General Vallancey seeks to draw2 between the “carn or heap”—the Galgals of Bretons and Syrians, and the “cearn or place of sacrifice,” that is, the altar. True, as he wrote three-quarters of a century ago, karn in Irish is a “heap to the dead,” and is represented in the Arabic word kern or karn, which Richardson calls merely a parvus mons; but the languages of Kooths, Skuths, or Kelts, are aIder thau modem Arabic, and in time, objects change both in name and purpose. Yet it is inter- esting to know that a modern language cearn is an altar, “from cearram or caram, ‘to kill,’ whence Cearnac, the sacrificing priest (sacerdos), . . . . . and Kearn or Cearn, a soldier or slayer;” all of which reminds us of charam or Haram, \\rh or \\rj, terms equally applied to “the devoted” persons, and to the animals, etc., required for sacrifice to the Light-God or Fertilizer, Jah or Jahveh. From charam, the slaughtered ones, we have Hormah, hmrh, the name of the place3 where the cruel Jahveh consented to give the Hebrews a victory over the Canaanites under King 1 Gen. xxxi. 44 to end.

The Greeks had an equivalent word to Hormah in Erma, which aspirated gives us Herma, and hence Hermes, who as Siva was also the Mountain, Light-god, and deity of conical Mount Hor or Aur, to whom Aaron—now held to be a sort of demi-god, is thought to have been sacrificed by his tribe. The kind of oath which Jacob is represented as having sworn to Jahveh on the Galeed or karn, or as General VaIIencey would say on the “Cearn of sacrifice,” as also Jewish patriarchal vows in general, were not confined to this kind of galeed, but were made as those required by Abraham and Jacob, on the I-r-k or euphemistic “thigh,” which signifies also “a shaft or stem of a tree.”1 PATRIARCHAL VOWS.—Elsewhere we have treated of these Jewish oaths sworn on “the thigh” of a living parent, but it is not generally known that the oath was also taken on that of a deceased ancestor, or a tomb, relic, or monumental emblem (Lingam) or pillar of him. Thus, when J acob and Laban had erected their pillar and Galeed, the former swore, we are told, “by the Fear (be-pachad) of his father Isaac,” and then remained all night on this loose stone heap, “killing beasts” and eating bread with his brethren. The subject here was marriage, purity of lineages and faithfulness, for Laban required him solemnly to swear that he would take no “other wives besides my daughters,”2 and this oath—be-pachad, or “by the fear of his father”3 is furthermore of the greatest consequence, as it takes the place of the name of “God” in our judicial oaths; only, for the Galeed and Pillar we have substituted the Christian Bible. Purity of lineage was also the reason averred by Abraham for his servant’s oath (Bagster’s Bible note translates thigh “in sectione circumcitionis meae,”) and purity of tribe or Fatherland was the cause why the dying Jacob asked Joseph to swear similarly. Cahen, in his translation of the passage “By the Fear,” takes no notice of Philo’s rendering, “By the Face,” and of others which here vary, thus suggesting some occult meaning which more refined times required to be veiled. A friend and good Hebraist whom I have consulted, thus writes to me concerning this passage. “djp has here another sense ‘the thigh,’ or ‘that which is thick, hard, strong, firm,’ the word is the Arabic Fakads, or the thigh, and in Job xl. 17, testicles—the object of some veneration and holy fear. There is perhaps some play of words here. tjp, pachath, is a pit or hole, jp pach, is a snare—see Isa. xxiv. 17, and Jer. xlviii. 43. Somewhat similar, in one sense are rkz hbqnv (Zakar-oo-Nekabah) and tjpw djp ‘point and hole,’4 ‘thigh and pit.’4 Joseph, in Gen. xlvii. 29, and Isaac in Gen. xxiv. 2, believe an oath taken on the genitals, ]ry, dhp (pahad Irik) to be most binding, therefore a high object of holy fear or veneration; in both cases it is a euphemism.” Fuerst confirms all this at page 1123, and the Rev. John Parkhurst is still clearer, showing that the root Pach or Pah signifies that which dilates or expands; Pachad that which “pants” or “shakes with joy,” and hence he 1 Gen. xxiv. 2; xlvii. 29.

I dissect the word into still simpler elements, viz., P’Al, P’El, PE-OR, &c., a dual God, both as to sex and qualities, of good and evil, light and darkness. This veiling of words is a custom of priests in all faiths; on consulting the same Hebrew scholar upon the words shemish and apholim or “emrods,” and 1 Sam. iv., v. and vi. genrally, in regard to the doubts I expressed as to this subject at page 150, vol. I., he writes: “More is here meant than appears on the surface; shemish means not only the Sun, but service, such service as the male renders to the female—Coition, and the Kaldi word Tashmish, from the root shemish, means the same thing. apholim is by many believed to be a euphemism for the buttocks; it is literally “hill-shaped rises’ such as the mons veneris. Another word is sometimes used by the reader, in the room of apholim, showing that the Hebrew reader thought the word written too gross to be spoken, and that word was \\yrwjf Techorim, ‘buboes.’ Several times, one of these words is used for the other, as if both were so gross in meaning that it was hard to choose between them. I believe the words to have been wilfully altered by the Jews, in order to hide the real sense of the passage, which can now only be guessed at. But I feel quite sure that it is Phallic.” We must, however, return to the Galgal, Galeed, or Karn. Karns were often raised merely to the memory of friends, and all well-wishers were expected “to add stone to stone,” and especially to so mark the grave of friends, noted chiefs, or places where many comrades fell in battle or by treachery. Asia, as well as Europe, abounds with such karns, which have perhaps led us to forget the original god of “the Heap.” On their summits, as well as on mountains—the natural karn—bonfires were commonly lit, and especially at Sol’s festivals, as with us at Beltine, Halloween, &c. Col. Forbes Leslie describes there fêtes as kept up so late as 1865. “In the island of South Uist,” he says, “around certain large kairns, it was customary, in 1865, for the inhabitants to make a religious progress on Sundays and other holidays. These processions always circled round the kairn three times, according to the direction of the Sun’s apparent course; and here poor lunatics were made to walk round three times sunwise, and were then ducked in an adjoining pool to restore their bewildered senses.”2 We have all seen prominent or peaked hills surmounted 1 [Gods, another solar-phallic hippopotamus . . . they get everywhere. — T.S.] 2 Early Races, I. 324, 325."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 258with a karn of stones in which was a pole or stone shaft precisely similar to that raised in the land of Gilead as “the Heap of Witness;” and we observe these on the smoothest mountain tops, where not a loose stone can be seen. I remember many such karns in India, Barma, and Syria; one on Tinto top, in Lanarkshire, had a strange fascination for me in early boyhood, intensely exciting my curiosity as to its “why” and “ wherefrom” on this great stone-less mountain. EARTHFAST STONES.—These often constitute places of “Prophecy,” and are used for various religious rites, as the Tānna-veris or place of worship in Aberdeenshire. They are occasionally surrounded by circles of stones. It is not to be doubted, from our knowledge of the use of these for sacrificial purposes, especially amongst Eastern aboriginal races, that they were so used in Europe; the more so when we do not find any permanent “Druidical” altars of sacrifice, beyond the Dolmen or Kistvaen. The Shepherd King, Saul, was in this plight, and therefore used for sacrifice, say Bible commentators, a great stone, which he made the people roll towards him.1 Those of my readers who have travelled amidst rude aboriginal tribes, will remember that all the principal matters of the village take place upon the neighbour-ing Earthfast stone, that is, on any rock near at hand which is tolerably level, and especially if occrrning at or about the level of the ground and on a mound overlooking the village and field. Here the village bonfire on holy days will be lighted, the sacrificial goat be offered, the village weddings celebrated, the village grain collected, trodden and meted out and in the rocky hollows of this famous trysting-place—sacred alike to parents, lovers, priests, and spirits—will the daily food of all the different families be pounded. Many joyous scenes can I remember on these “Earth- fast rocks,” in wild and out-of-the-way villages, and at many a picturesque wedding have I sat on such spot-watching the merry young dancers. Under the neighbouring Neem or Ficus Religiosa was the little altar with the “Lares and Penates,” and all their little concomitants of flowers, fire, holy-water, &c., and under the adjoining weird frowning cliff, the Warlock, Demon or Azazil, the “good man of the croft,” whom it is not wise to call bad. Here too was the “stranger’s shed” where the wearied one was welcomed with food and water, and not less so, such as she who in sore travail sought a haven at “Beth-lehem of Judea.” In every sense there was here a Divinity—the Tsur or Rock-God,2 as well as a Beth-lechem or “house of bread,” for no cake was eaten which did not come from it; all grain must be here garnered, or trodden out and ground into flour, as well as blessed and prayed over at this rural altar. Can it be wondered that the spot was sacred to the “Lord of Lechem,” and to the “Lady,” or “Bread-distributing Mother”—“Kubeli of the cup?”—whose were the rocky basins where the little ones received their daily portion. On gala days I have seen these rocky cups encircled with. flowers and gay with tinsel, and carefully guarded from defilement, especially from my own profane shadow. Natural mills and rock basins are not however always to be had, and in times gave place to the constructed mill, in which again the godly forms appeared; see figures on pages 302 and 303, Vol. I. 1 1 Sam. xiv. 33-35. 2 For the Tsur-god, cf.

MOT, MOAT, MHOID, MOD-AID-AN, &c.—These are all terms which have been occasionally given by Kelts to hills, or places where a judge, court, or council have presided, and seem all reducible to a radical, signifying the place where the Mard, Mot, or patriarchal Man presides, for on all these Mot-mounds are found columns or sacred stones, the representatives of man.3 Mut or Murt still signifies in India, a human image, symbol, or Nishān, and in Mahamad’s day a very sacred monolith or Lingam, which overlooked the valley of Meka, was replaced by the figure of a man. The green mound called Moothill, near the church at Skone, was the old pillar-hill, and in time became a Tam-a-Mhoid, or “Court Hill.” At Auchterless, near Rathen Church, there is a moat hill with two columnar stone circles and a holy well, while near the church at Cruden (said to be built wholly out of “one stone, on which hallow fires were former-ly lighted”) was another moat-hill. As a dun or Omphe stands for a hill or stone (Doondi-Yoni), we can see how the term Mod-a-dun was given to the place where the mot-stone stood, and how as language changed, this term became Maidan; as instances of this there is the Maidan, or as now called, the Maiden stone of Pittodrie, covered with hieroglyphics, and a similar one in the harbour of St. Andrew’s in Fife. Even if we take the Gaelic words Mor, Mo, or Moid, for “large” (moid is an adjective as well as a substantive), still I think, from various analogies in the East, we may consider Mot to be a sacred hill of the stone, or man, indeed Modh is “Man” in Gaelic, and Moth is the male emblem.4 I shall now state as tersely as possible the facts which antiquaries seem pretty well to have established. in regard to Kelts and their remains, with a view to making these matters clear to the most cursory reader:— 1. Druid circles were not places of sepulture, but of worship and sacrifice. 2. They may have been placed for the worship of Fetishes, and all the fertile energies, represented by Baal, Toth, or Asher, the pillar God, and Ceres or Sidi, the Grove or Ashera; also for paying adoration to the manes of ancestors; and lastly, for a tolerably pure solo-pythic Faith. 1 Early Races, I., 220, 221.

They were the Clachans or sacred circles where the earliest races of the land met and chanted their circle, cyclic, or Kuklik hymns, and where in later days Christian worshipped, and performed other holy acts. 4. Closely adjoining these Klachans, the Christian priests erected their kirks, and, freely or under pressure permitted the ancient rites and sacrifices even on “church-going” days, only assuring the half-converted Kelts that the victims, as kine, &c., were merely to be considered as food for which thanks were due to Jehovah and his Son. 5. The sacrifice of cattle was common all over our is1ands until 1000 years A.C., and in many places, as for instance Innis-Mura, was continued np to the 17th century, and believed to be acceptable to the Deity, but after that period, the act must be dissevered from Christianity, and although cattle here and there continued to be sacrificed, even up to the 19th century, yet the offerings were somewhat clandestine, and only to the old Keltik or local god, and for heathen purposes. 6. It is an undeniable fact that stone circles in great numbers, and over the whole world, not excepting all Polynesia and the Americas, were in former ages commonIy erected as places of worship, and sacrifice, and that over many parts of the world people still erect them. 7. The principal monolith, or centre stone in most circles, is so placed therein, that the rising sun may illumine it at favourite seasons of the year, but instead of one central stone, there is often found one large with two small side stones, and all placed towards the west side of the centre as at Stonehenge. 8. Where inner circles exist, they are generally composed of smaller stones than the outer, and the circles are concentric, but the oval is the commonest figure. 9. Circles have usually one or more avenues, marked out by monoliths; Avebury has two circles and two avenues; Stonehenge one, with a monolith at the entrance. 10. In the neighbourhood of the circles are mounds, barrows, or karns (some-times also encircled by standing stones), which may have been places of sepelture, or for sepulchral deposits. These were probably places for “visitation” by the wor-shippers and pilgrims, as we still find this customary in the East. 11. Large monoliths, more or less independent of the circles, and symbolic of a religious idea, are to be found over all our islands and indeed the world, and tell us of a universal homogeneity of faith independent of race. 12. Some of these Lingams have what is called the Ogham or Ogmik character scratched upon them, as on the sides of this “Newton Stone.” Fig. 251, by a primitive, but probably more advanced race than the original erectors, see Vol. I. p. 387. Five such stones have been found in Shetland and Orkney, and as many on the mainland of Scotland. The lettered character is doubtless by a much later people.

A race or races followed, who sculptured strangely and profusely both on menhirs and earth-fast rocks, such figures as circles, crescents, cavities, cups, &c., see Nos. I., VI., VIII., IX., and XIII., of Fig. 252. These hieroglyphica are considered sym-bols of religious ideas, connected with the worship of the Serpent, Toth or Hermes, Ceres, Kub-ele, and other favourite gods and goddesses of Kelts and pre-Keltik peoples. 14. A third race—genernlly called non-Aryan Pichs, and also from Asia —added to the cup-hieroglyphics further religious symbols, evidently Solar and Lunar, but confined these to menhirs, not adding to the marks on “earth-rocks,” which had found such favour with the previous race. 15. The Pictish additions com-monly give representations of the mirror and comb-symbols of Astarte or Ishtar,1 the double disk, horse-shoe, arch, crescent, altar, serpent, elephant and bird, with a so-called “sceptre,” peculiar to each, as Nos. III., V., VII., XI., and XII. of this engraving. 16. The later as well as the earlier race and faiths of these islands are acknowledged to have come from Asia. The emigrants gathered vary varied religious ideas and symbols as they slowly traversed the lands, or dwelt for a time among the homes of many diverse races, and these ideas they welded into a kind of homogeneity, with their own, bearing them along westward. Before proceeding to illustrate and elucidate these statements—the generally acknowledged results of scientific investigation, let us mention and bear in mind certain remarks—“articulate propositions” he calls them, which were ably stated before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in the Session of 1869-70, by its learned anti-quary, J. Stuart Blackie, Professor of Greek in that University.2 He begins by pay-ing a just tribute to the labours and admirable discerning powers of Jacob Bryant, and protests against the “ingenious aberrations” of certain modern writers on myth-ology, who see the Sun, dawn, twilight, and such-like, in every god and goddess; and as he puts it, “find the germ of the Pelasgic shepherd God (Hermes and his familiar phallic symbol3) in the breeze of the early dawn, which ushers in the march of the busy day.” The Professor states it as a “fact, that some of our most recent writers on this subject have not advanced a single step in respect of scientific method beyond Jacob 1 Clem. of Alexandra calls Venus’ symbol of the comb, “the euphemism for woman’s part, Mōrion gunaikeion.” 2 Trans.

Bryant is also quoted by Blackie with approval as establishing the fact, that “the whole theology of Greece was derived from the East.”1 He condemns “the prosaic system of Euhemerus” of 300 B.C., because that Greek tried “to prove that all the Greek Gods, not excepting Jove, had been originally dead men deified;” the chief error here being, that he thus declared religious worship to have no other origin; the “opposite theory” of this—“much in fashion with the Germans,” viz., tht “the Gods were merely elevated men,” the Greek professor thinks equally untenable. He justly emphasizes the truth that “the most reliable witnessess” in ancient mythologies and faiths, are not poets like “Homer, who in the exercise of their art often took large liberties with sacred tradition, but rather such writers as Pausanias, who record the old temple lore in its fixed local forms.” Hartung2 is held to have “done important service to comparative mythology, by drawing attention emphatically to the difference between sacred LEGENDS as believed by the people, and religious MYTHS freely handled by the poers.” Now to my mind the idea of the Myth, and not its after-garniture, nor the narrative connected with it, is the real fact to get at; for embellishments— the gloss of fertile imaginations, and especially the spiritualising processes which we see the priests around us constantly and most unwarrantably adopting—cloud or efface the original real germ, which every searcher after the Roots of Faiths must sternly address himself to discover; and this says Professor Blackie— “can only be done by collecting all the facts relating to it, working them up into a complete, and if possible consistent picture, and not till then attempting an explanation.” Yet he adds—“the mere collec- tion of facts will never help a prosaic or irreverent man to the interpretation of what is essentially poetic and devout. A book supplies what must be read; but the eye that reads it can only see what by natural faculty and training it is fitted to see. As the loving and reverential contemplation of nature was the original source of the polytheistic myths, so the key to them all, will often be recovered by a kindred mind acting under influences similar to those which impressed the original framers of the myth: and if this may be dones with a considerable amount of success by a poetical mind acted on by nature in any country, much more will success be achieved by such a mind in the country where the myths were originally formed.” Now the searcher after a Myth-idea must traverse regions pre-literary; a regular written literature obscures, nay usually conceals the original idea, and frequently veils all the symbolism, as coarse or unfitted for an intenser and more defining light. The naked Linga or Eduth must be encased in an ark, and this in a tabernacle or dark cell of a temple, and be only shown to the public, by a dim or distant light, so that the imagination may have full room to play amid the memories of the past, and sonic effects of the present. None know better than archpriests that the multitude do not require a real man, nor God, nor authenticated history in order to frame their faith; a 1 Bryant, A New System, or an Analysis of Ancient Mythology, I., 184. 2 Greek Myths, I. 184."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 263legendary nucleus will, says Blackie, be a sufficiently convenient vehicle for embodying all floating mythological notions. Nevertheless, we must not assume when we reach the idea of the myth, that it contains no historical elements of its own, nor that be-cause the Lingam-god existed, as I elsewhere show, as well among ancient Magians as modern Fijians,1 and similar ideas over all the isles of Eastern Asia—the cradle lands of Papuans, Mahories, Samoans, and Tahitians, and in the two Americas,—that one or other of these originated the faith, and taught the others. Man is sufficiently akin to man everywhere, so that, given like desires and passions, the same fertilising orb, with his varying seasons of fertility and sterility, and his uniform or analogous modes of manifestation, we are justified in expecting to find the same results, the same prayers and petitions, sacrifices and offering, varied only according to the state of intelligence of the offerers and sacrificers. Let us here however prooeed to the illus-tration of the propositions we laid down in regard to Kelts. In a Scotch Presbytery record of the fourteenth century, among other abomina-tions denounced are “the sacrifice of beasts, adoration of wells, other superstitions, monuments and stones.” Thus the people clearly held such a faith as Ezekiel and other Jewish writers denounced as common among their tribes;2 like these too the Kelts considered the ground around which the emblems of deity stood, and where they met to worship, very hallowed soil, more especially where defined by megali-thic columns. The emblem was superseded in time by its Ark-box, and that by the temple, upon the Zion, or “mount of the Lord.” It has taken much time and labour on the part of men of great learning and research, and much travel by themselves or others, to provide these conclusions; for step by step could only be won after severe resistance, owing to religious prejudices and a fear lest the recognition of other and far more ancient religious rites and ceremonies than the existing, might show faith to be but a growth, and not a thing sui generis—alone and apart, the first, the only and the last “Revelation of God to Man.” Progress in such archeology as we are considering has thus been very slow, but perhaps all the more sure, though unsatisfactary to the bold pioneers who ventured out of the beaten tracks, and dared to avow their convictions, and call things by their real names. Such writers as Bryant, Higgins, Vallencey and Moore of the past, and Inman, Keane and many more of these times, have been slighted or sneered at by a large class of writers, principally untravelled and much trammelled individuals, who cannot persuade themselves to ac-knowledge the reality of views which they dislike and do not acquiesce in; yet truth must in the long run prevail, and in spite of errors, and often indefensible etymologies on the part of the unorthodox, many and great facts have brought about strong and true convic-tions, that the men named are right in the main, and that the one great primeval faith of man which has led to all others, was in rude and bestial days, but the worship of Fertility. 1 Cf. Figs. 222, 223, pp. 139, 140, ante. 2 Ezek. viii. 2, 7, 10-14. We see by the early chapters that the God of this writer is a Fire- deity, hence he denounces the worship of a chamber or cell with a hole in the wall, and “all the idols of the house of Israel pourtrayed upon the wall.” "},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 264It is but as yesterday even in our own history, that holy fires gleamed, if not from Irish towers, at least from Irish Mount Zions, or hills dedicated to the great Zeus, and that Kelts leaped or ran through fires, or pushed themselves through clefts and holes, as pious or purificat.ry rites, similar to those still in vogue over all Asia; nay, do not Turks and Greeks—men and maidens, even now slide down that rock of the Areopagus, because it is supposed to possess fertilising powera? Passing through the cleft of a tree, or a circle formed by boughs of particular trees or shrubs or a circle of bread, cake, or a cheese (witness the so-called “Oxford groaning cheese”) which was possible in the case of babes, was always most desirable, both for good health (“Sal-vation\"” and fertility. Many gravely argued that this was more efficacious than a stone cleft, be it the Kerles-cant of Bretony (Pl. XII. 7), the Rollrich of Oxfordshire (Pl. VII. 8), or the Craig-Madi in Stirlingshire—a once favourite resort of new married couples, simply because it was clearly once a Maha-Deva, rising erect out of a swampy basin over an Ionish-looking cleft. My small drawing (Pl. X. 11) does not show this so clearly as do the plates of Colonel F. Leslie1 and others. Among circles constructed by boughs and creepers, none were supposed to impart such invigorating and fertilising powers as those formed by woodbine, but most rustics preferred the natural clefts of their own locality, rarely making pilgrimages to any others, unless rumours of some wonderful miracles reached them, and this is still the rule in the East. Cornish people preferred pasing through Cornish stones, and far northern Kelts swore by the efficiency of “great Odin’s stone,” near the Stennis circle of Orkney, see Fig. 59, page 156, Vol. I. None durst break a vow made here, nor dare a Campbell slight one taken by the trysting-place—that quaint hole in the rude column—near the old Church of St Coustan, Campbeltown; whatever lover slighted his troth plighted here, might be destroyed by any avenging hand. Akin to the St. Coustan stone, was that mysterious one which lay on the banks of the Tweed at Coldstream bridge—the “Greystone stone,”2 in “the Greystone field,” “which could marry a couple faster (that is stronger) than any parson.” Only in the last century did the Presbytery of Dingwall become suddenly indig-nant that their people should still sacrifice bulls, circumambulate old shrines, &c., nay, that they should even consult “the holed-stone of Applecross” regarding not only their journeyings through this life, but after death; and even thrust their heads into its hole to be cured of disease, as well as of ignorance; and no wonder, for it seemed to prove that in spite of twelve centuries of Christian teaching, their flocks still placed much reliance on bulls and stones. In Betz of Bretony the same confidence was exhibited in a tumulus, though Christianity had built a chapel over it, and called it St. Cedo. The religious Bretons had found a hole in this building, and to this they went, to listen to the oracular responses of their old God, nay, more regularly and often than to those which issued from St Cedo’s pulpit.

At this crevice men and women used to strip themselves and lie down, and make friends drag them through the regenerating aperture. So too Irish men and women did and probably still do, in the case of St. Declare’s stone at Ardmore, Co. Waterford, where in 1826, crowds of pious Christiam used to push or pull themselves through this IOnic cleft. “Threading the needle” is still practised in Ripon cathedral.1 As Fire was divine when lighted by friction, so every Phallic or IOnic stonewas holy per se, and that these are so still in India I have often experienced when trying, for engineering purposes, to remove even the most neglected; this in districts where education had considerably prevailed, otherwise, the very attempt was fraught with danger. The surroundings and fame of a sacred rock, stone or symbol, as that on or near to which kings were crowned, as the stone of Skone, now of Westminster, the supposed stone of Jacob, of Jupiter Olympos, of that of Mount Moriah, the symbolic shape—as ark-like, obeliskal, spiral, &c.—all or any, might add to its importance, yet nought detracted from the object’s sanctity; it might be rude and shapeless—wood or stone, like the sacred symbol of the Paphian Venus at Emisa,—nay, it might even be a mere fragment like the black stone of Meka, yet with the pious it was equally sacred; a strange objective fiction akin to some subjective and spiritual fictions of these days, as that “the more unreasonable or incomprehensible any doctrine or scriptural statement is, so much the more should it be believed in as a test of faith.” In Scotland, to hang up a stone over cattle in their stalls was a sure preventative of all mischief; so we see eggs, caskets, &c., hung over tombs, and even beds; but none, said Christianity, should resist “natural consequences,” so in the last days of our 16th century one poor lady of rank not only lost all her lands and wealth, but was actually burnt to death for using potent stone-charms. It appears that she put “a horrid stane” or stone with a hole in it, under her pillow to procure relief from natural pains, and. that James I., hearing of it, “permitted her to be burnt,” instead of strangled, as her sins merited. So merciful have religions been to us!2 Other countries paid quite as much attention to these subjects as Northern Europe; I have myself been urged to try the salutary effect of passing through rocky apertures, in Europe as well as Asia. Failing trees and stones, we read of other methods of “regenerating lost souls;” thus Athens, says Potter “received again to her arms an expatriated child, by passing it through the lap of a woman’s gown, 80 that he or she might seem to be born again!” Any form of the Vesica piscis, writes Moore, is nature’s matrix. “With Platonists, Vulcanists, or Sivaites it is creation, it is heat, it is renovation, it is fire, it is regeneration, it is all in all. What fire was to the Vishnooites, water was to the votaries of Neptune, to whom the sea was 1 The Cathedral is built over the Cell or Chapel of the old races, and here is a Yoni hole where hundreds in a day are sometimes pulled through.   2 Early Races, II. 300."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 266but the hollow of the hand—the great Argha of nature, or matrix, of production and reproduction.”1 Rudeness or ungainliness had here no depreciatory effect. Among things which should be shapely and beautiful, but are rude, formless and ugly yet deeply venerated, was the Kubele of Pessinus—a mere lump of stone, very similar to the Paphian Aphrodite; so the Sun, though worshipped as the source of all fertility, was commonly shown as only a rudely formed circle on a block of stone, or as “a Sun-stone,” on a galgal or in a Druid Circle of Lingams—those Beth-Els of Phenicians and all the early tribes of Western Asia.2 As standing on a mound of fertile land, or overlooking the most productive parts of Mother Terra, the holy Klach, Eben-ezar, or “Sun-stone,” was held in truth and verity, and not only in pious fancy, a “Heale” and Saviour of mankind; for thousands could and did relate innumerable cases in which the atones had directly healed or had granted fertility, not only to men and women, but to their flocks; and what but want of belief prevents such places being crowded still? Would Jacob have accepted his Gods, either Elohim or Jehovah, if he had not been promised “seed as the dust of the earth,” and prosperity in land, and flocks, and herds? And if not, then there would have been no Elohim, and no Old Test. history, because no children of El or Is-Ra-El. Yet we should doubtless have had other Al-e-im, for when we crave, either for Gods, or miracles, they appear, and none so common or so much craved for, as those yielding us sub-stantial mundane blessings. Jacob’s chosen Deity is still the universal Lord of all nations, and nations are but a concretion of individuals, and neither ymmg nor old have ever refused to vow with that patriarch in his youthful days; “If thou God will be with me,” and give me all I ask—all substantial blessings in lands, gold, flocks and herds, but above all, make me the father of many peoples, “then shall the Jahveh be my Aleim.”3 GRUAGACH, signifying literally “the fair haired,” was, writes Col. F. Leslie, a large rude stone, on which “libations of milk were poured,”4 and which a clergyman of the Western Isles said, “got the credit of being the father of a child towards the close of last century; this Gruach,” continues the reverend gentleman, “was the Sun,” as indeed this name significes in Gaelic, though now commonly pronounced Grian—Irish, Grien or Krien. It is thought that from the Keltic term Grunoeus (Apollo), comes our English name Guern-sey—an islet lying off that Karnak coast, so sacred to Maha-Kāl, or “St Michel,” and all Solo-phallic lore; Karnak of the Nile, had also an island holy to Hermes and all phallic gods. Near to our isle of Gryn or Guern, was also a St. (A) pol (o), St. Eloi (Elias or Helios) and Tot.

Kar-On is equivalent to K-Am or Ak-Am, Ka and Ar, “the sun or place of heat”—the male Kiun (Chiun) or Am-On, whom the Pheni, says Strabo, called Ba-al or Balitho, and which the orthodox Mr. Kenrick allows was “probably the Eternal Lord” of the pious Job, and therefore of all Jews and Phenicians.1 I have already dwelt much upon Ak, Ar, As, etc., see the numerous references under these in Indexes, and called attention to thcir con- geners, as the adh, Agh or Ach of Cuthites and Irish—which came to be the Sun, and to that of Hindoos, which is Fire.

The temple Kar-is or Kar-On in Egypt, had on it a representation of the Chi-un, or unfringed phallic “Eye”2—the “mark” of the ever-virgin Koonti, or Sri Parvati, which we see adorning the foreheads of nearly every deity in Moore’s Pan-theon; so also many Aithiopian, and most Kuklopian and Egyptian structures pro-minently displayed this on their doors, walls, peristyles, etc., and later, even Asiatic Boodhists on rearing similar and highly phallic structures, as those on next page, sculp-tured upon them this Eye symbol; compare Figs. 24, 162, 224, &c. The very term K’Ar-is, signifies a Prutaneion, or sacred place of fire, and therefore corresponds to the Hindoo feminine idea of the Agni Mandalam;3 so that a Karis is a place where Karians or Ionians (Vishnooites), as well as Jovites or Sivaites could worship. Ghar, says Max Müller, is the equivalent of Kar in Sanskrit, “which soon sinks down to Har,” the name applied to both Vishnoo and Siva, and signifying to “glitter, to be bright, to be happy, to burn, to be eager,”4 all terms applied to such gods and Jahveh, “the jealous,” or rather “burning and eager” One; so Hara or Hora is Siva in his fertilizing capacity, and Hari is Vishnoo, the Ionik form of the Solar deity. Kar is seen in the Greek Kairo, I rejoice, and gothic geiro, desire, yearning; in Sanskrit, Haryati, signifies “to desire.” The Bacchus or Iakos meaning is seen in Gar (Sanskrit), “to shout, to roar as a bull, to praise,” for he was a seductive and eloquent god like Hermes. The Karig-kroith, Gruagach, or Karan-idea, then, is found in all lands. It is recognised by both the right and left hand sects of Hindooism; it is seen in the Rud stone, No. III. of this Fig. 253, erected by Yorkshiremen;5 in the Arabi-Petra eaves and columns, No. IV.; in the Omphi or Boodhist Topes, with phalli on summit, Nos. VI., X., and XV., and in the Sri-Linga-like objects, XII. to XVI., where in one case we have the prepucial line marked by entwined serpents, notifying love and passion, Siva and Sivi, and in the other, “the-Yoni, Eyes” of eternity or “eternal life.” This Fig. 253, was more especially prepared to illustrate the advance of faiths architecturally; to show how Phallism, as the oldest and most universal, was also the most persistent of all religions and carried its leading ideas and features on through 1 Kenrick’s Phen., p. 300.

The Petros of the Petrian troglodytes (No. IV.) is similar to that of many others, see Figs. noted below,1 and stands well out on their Shinar as did that before Babylon, which it per-haps preceded. It would seem to have been a natural phallos, like the adjoining “Rude stone” (III.) which Yorkshire men once similarly honoured, but had fallen and broken like that seen at its foot. Standing there in front of the houses of the tribes—their mountain Omphe—it represented to them collectively, what the Lares and Penates did in their family worship. The “Oratory of Gallerus” in county Kerry, No. II., is simply an artificial cave dwelling, and I place beside it, to complete the likeness with No. I., a men-hir such as the Petreans had, and which I doubt not existed not far off, for Mr. Marcus Kean is clear as to the Kuthite origin of this “Lik-Melchedor, or Church of Golden Molach.”2 1 Cf.

In the far east the sacred fetishes seem to have been first hid away in such rude omphi, or womb-like tumuli as that of the Tope of Bimera, No. VI., or those of Java and Ceylon, of which No. X. is a fair specimen; and to this general type, Boodhist ecclesiastical art adhered to in its latest days in India, Ceylon, and parts of Barma, as witness those beautiful shrines which Ceylonese artists are never weary of depicting, and of which the outline of No. XV. is a well known and typical sample. Siva here too still asserts his reign, and Adāma’s high conical peak, or as the Mahomedan would name it, the Tukt-oo-Salēm or “Throne (metaphorically, “King”) of life or Salvation,” is still the dominant point and idea—lost though the latter be to the modern worshipper. We see the same Adám or Lingam peak on the Birs-Nimrud of Babylon, vide p. 153, Vol. I. of Hist. of Architecture, by Mr. Fergusson—an author guileless of phallic lore. The second ecclesiastial advance was to raise Siva on an Asana or throne, such as we see in the outline of the Saltanpore Tope of Oud (No. V.), and which is precisely similar to the base of the Innis Mura Lingam of Ireland,1 and to that of most rural Indian Sivaik shrines. Nos. XII. and XIV. are architectural advances on these, for besides the Asana, there is what the Hindoo calls a Chavaranga round the base, that is a sunken altar—the Yoni of Maha Deva, on which offerings to him are deposited. The enclosure in these Boodhist shrines however, clearly mark another development of worship—that of circumambulation, the place provided for which in Hindoo temples is known as the Pradakshina. Kaldians and Phenicians, Skyths (Kooths), Kelts, and Greeks, circumambulated their deities or holy places, just as Samuel of Rama’s city in Syria did, and as Syrians and Arabs still, with reverent and measured tread, move interminably around that oval path which encircles the Mekan and other such arks and shrines. Greeks used on such occasions to chant their Kuklik or Circle hymns, as do Moslems their Koran, and as Samuel did his psalms or prayers —perchance for vengeance against poor Agag; for we must not imagine, as our version implies, that the cruel judge went to such places as Beth-El and Gilgal only to judge Israel. The writer in saying that he “circuited from year to year in Bethel, Gilgal,” etc., and raised an altar at Rāma,2 believed that the oriental reader would rightly understand that when a high priest of Ra-El goes to a Beth-El or Gilgal, to circuit or circumambulate, the religious rite is understood, whatever else may be implied, and especially so in the case of a solarist or Yahvehist of the city of Ram—the Sun God. Gilgal, too, was a mount with Ra-El’s twelve signs or Nishāns, all duly set up after a solemn selection from the bed of the adjoining sacred river; nay, more, it was the “heap of foreskins”—that celebrated spot where the very solemn Phallic sacrifice of the circumcision of a million of males had taken place, and where many celebrated images were kept.3 On all these accounts, it became the Eastern 1 Fig. 183, p. 485, Vol. I. 2 I Sam. vii. 16, 17.

WITH THE SACRED CELLS OR RECESSED OBJECTS COMMON TO CHRISTIANITY. head-quarters or centre of the faith, from the time of Joshua to that of Saul, and for several centuries after. The very word Levi, signifies “the Circling Ones.” The circmnambulation of circles and the chaunting of Cyclic or Kuklik hymns were far older customs than Greeks can tell us of. Proklus statee that “the Epic Cycle is deduced from a mixture of heaven and earth, from which came three hundred handed spms, and three Kuklops,” pointing to this old outward rite of an ancient race, as having been perhaps, the reason why they were so called; just as those tribes who were seen adoring the sun—Shams or Shem were named Shemites. The stone circle was first called by Greeks Kir-kir or Kel-kel (hence, say some, “the Kelti,”), and latterly Kuklos, and all great poets and leaders of the Circle rites were termed the Kukliks, amongst whom Hesiod and Homer were perhaps the last to take rank; the earliest “Cyclic poets” are said to have written of “themes bound by the magic circle of primeval mythology,” from which, when the Homeric scholiasts quoted, “they simply said ™n kukloi legei, ‘as it is written in the Circle,’ equivalent to the Biblical saying, “as it is written in the prophets.’ ”1 Thus in later days the Athenian would clench an argument or lay down a rule upon some principle or saying enunciated in his Akademeia; which by the way was a grove like that in which earlier seers had taught, and had given forth their oracles as those of heaven; and so with Kelts, for as Dr. Garden says, all Druid Circles or “groves” were surrounded by sacred trees, called Koits or Coets. Arktinos one of the early Kuklik poem wrote a kind of Iliad of “The Aithiopis,” those originators of Kuklik rites. I must ask attention here to three more types of very emblematic temples (Fig. 254), sketched on the spot by myself; one in Upper Barma, one in Benares, and one in Rajpootana, all very widely apart, not only geographically, but in faith, yet in entire accord architecturally. The idea, of No. I., though lost now in the faith of the Boodhist and possibly in that of the Jain (No. V.), is still rampant and repre-sented in the Sivaite shrine, No. II., which is given as a typical form of the Vinānas or higher portions of all Sivo-Hindoo temples in Upper India, Bengal, and Orisa. It is in two parts of which I show only the upper portions, and consists of a large goombus or ovate chamber—the cell of Life, or the Life-God, and clearly the scrotum, Galeed, Hermes, or Heap, which from Jacob2 downwards phallic worshippers have always 1 Leslie’s Origin of Man, p. 216. Sic. 2 Our translation, as well of Rabi Cohen’s, of Gen. xxxi. 48, tries to veil the Pillar-God, merely saying, “This heap is a witness,” but the Septua-gint says, “Behold the pillar and the heap.” Cf. figs. 31, p. 91; 47, p. 139, & Temple 93, p. 218. I. "},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 271erected at the foot of, or around their pillar-God. No. I. was sketched by me in Pagān Myoo, the very ancient capital of Upper Barma, because it is now a very unusual form of Boodhist templet and therefore one shewing the old parentage—the phallic, which in Barma is now an obsolete faith. No. V. is the old Jain temple of Sadri in Raj-pootana, divested of many of its later accessories, so as to show here too, the original idea which lies at the base of that faith. No. IV. is a distant view of the altar shrine of the Church of St Menoux in Burgundy; and No. III. is the inner sacred object of the same enlarged, so as to exhibit the IOnik idea which lies at the root of the Mariolatry of early and present Christianity. Any books on architecture will afford the thoughtful investigator of the old or lost ideas, as good samples of these, as those I have selocted; thus under “Ancient Roman Architecture,” in Fergusson’s Hist. of Arch. see such temples as that of Tivoli and Spalatro (pp. 311, 312, vol. I.), in strict accordance with Vesta’s shrine, No. VII. of my Fig. 253; and under Tombs, those of San Vito, St. Helena, St. Remi, &c. (pp. 345-349); Jewish samples of the same idea follow under the names of the “Tomb of Absalom,” “Zechariah,” &c. Heathen Rome made no pretence of hiding her “candle under a bushel,” as witness the columns of Mars and Jupiter Stator, or the Lord Sthān u , as Siva is called when stand- ing in the Yoni.1 Vesta’s shrine was after the male form, while the Pantheon, St. Sophia, and most “Lady Chapels” represent the womb or Yoni. The same ideas, in spite of all our knowledge of these things, are still unwittingly represented in the homes of the most enlightened Hindoos as well as Englishmen. A familiar instance of this is before me at the present moment, in two handsome Bengal fans which adorn a lady’s boudoir; these go back to the very roots of the old faith. On one is a Lingam temple—all spire—of the most correct phallic proportions, backed by a very similarly shaped dark foliaged tree, which throws out brightly the proportions of the obeliskal God, and before him kneel three handsomely dressed young women making their offerings, and praying for his favours—of course offspring or husbands. On the other fan, a handsome young prince takes the place of the obscene emblem, and to him a beautiful young lady approaches with music and song. In its symbolism Christianity has neither lagged behind nor followed servilely or by compulsion, as a glance through the architecture of Europe and Asia amply illustrates, if we divest most of the cathedrals, tombs, and churches, of their ornamental abut-ments and such accessories as are due principally to height and hollowness of framing. The general type is that of the cathedrals of Ani or of FIorence, Nos. I. and IX. of Fig. 253, which are Sivaik in. both plan and section. In tombs we have often such strange phalli as No. VIII., also of Ani; and as the rich erected a temple—phallic or IOnik, over or in memory of themselves, so those who could not afford this erected tombs, in plan or elevation, or both, for their gods or favourite shrines. Boat or almond-shaped graves or tombs were thus common, especially among Kelts and Skandinavians, as a 1 Mahābhārata, Muir’s Sansk. Texts and Burgess’ Elephanta, p. 59."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 272glance at Waring’s Stone Monuments will satisfy the reader.1 One—the Talayot of S a n t a C l a r a, in the north part of Minorka, goes still by the name of Nao, a word even yet in universal use for “a boat” throughout Asia. In Armenia the tree-idea seems to have prevailed for a long time; stone coffins being cut out as precisely as possible like a tree stem—a holy and phallic form, see Waring’s Pl., C 1, Fig. 5, p. 80. The New Grange sepulchre in Ireland (Ibid., PI. XXXI), reminds us more of the Karnak idea, whilst the common but comparatively modem Cumberland grave, like that which I show in Vol. I. Pl. VIII., p. 386, is one still usual in the east for races with Lingaite proclivities. The so-called grave of Joseph at Shechem (Fig.2), is a good sample of the burial-place of a Yonite, for here is the full round womb, and two stones—carriers of fire and bread offerings, the ever-recognized signs of “The Lord,” or “Bread-maker.” Both are also characteristic of Joseph, “The Increaser,” or Iu-Seph, [swy, the “Jah’s Cup,”2 which, though like our Holy Ghost, feminine in idea, is yet presented to us as a male Saviour. In regard to the circumambulation of holy places, all Kelts, Pagan and Christian, religiously observed this, and until quite lately our ancestors also; these were always careful to perambulate “dei-siol or sun-wise.” Dr. Jamieson tells us in his Scottish Dictionary, that among many parishes, Tillie Beltane was the most punctilious in this respect; that every “Beltane morning the people went to a well held in great veneration, next to a Druid circle of eight stones, where heavenly fire was kindled, and after drinking of the waters, walked nine times in procession round the well,” and temple; and he adds, “so deep rooted is this superstition in the minds of nmny who reckon themselves good Protestants, that they did not neglect these rites even when Beltane fell on a Sabbath;” why should they, on Bel’s own holy day? Nine is a sacred Keltik number, and common in matters connected with Druid circlces, taking the place which seven holds in the eyes of Arabs, Jews, and Shemites generally; but the divisors, measures and multiples of nine are also used, and seem to command certain heavenly rights of their own. Thus to walk three times round a sacred circle, well, or stone, Desil or sun-wise (east to west) brought good fortune, but to do so with a “Cyclic hymn” or chaunt, greatly increased the delight of heaven; and this is therefore still done in many parts of Europe, even where the people cannot be called “Pagan,” as Captain Burnaby, of equestrian fame, boldly designates most of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is said that we still retain in some old English choruses the odes which those Phallo-Solar worshippers ttaed to chaunt. Thus “Hey down, down derry down,” is held to be “Hai down ir deri danno,” signifying “Come let us haste to the oaken grove;” or if the Keltik were “Dun dun daragan dun,” it would be, “To the hill, to the hill, to the oaks, to the hill.” Another chant. “High trolollie, lollie loi, or lee,” is said to come from the Keltik “Ai tra lâ, la, li,” which would be an address to the rising sun, as “Hail! early 1 Lon., 1870.

A good Kelt, should he fall down, was bound to jump up quickly, turn about sun-wise three times, and trace out a circle on the ground, this in honour of Sol, or to let out the earth devil; at all times, when a pious person walked or journeyed, he endeavoured to move from east to west. Mr. Martin, who tells us a good deal about these Keltish habits, and who is an author of the seventeenth century, perfectly ignorant of the phallic God and faith con-cerning which he has told us so many facts, says that the good Christians of Rona seized him, blessed, and turned him about thrice, and that they never permitted the wealthy and those they respected, to go about without fire, which they ever and again passed around them Deasil ways. Boats before setting off from the shore received a deasil twist, and all, even pious Christians were in the habit of forming “religious processions and moving sun-wise round cairns and stones reared for some object.” “When the Lewis people visited the Flannan Isles,—Insulæ Sacræ—on reaching the summit they uncovered their heads, made a turn round sun-wise, and gave thanks to God,” and to secure a happy marriage, the Keltik bride had to contrive to reach her new home Deasil wise. The followers of Jove, Jahveh, Deus, and Ala have alike recognised solarisms, and always taken due care as to the orientation of their tombs. Most blessed was that person who could find a grave in tha holy Isle of Hi or Iona and have a requiem chanted over his body whilst it first rested on its sacred mound of Eala-El or Helios, ere it was laid with many Deasil rites in an Yonik tomb.2 All Deasil rites had a general prophylactic character, and were therefore specially observed at births, churchings, sacrifices, and other observances, and all fetes of Ceres, especially Rogatiary and Equinoxial ones. I have myself seen “the Deasil twist” administered to ailing poultry, and various authors tell us of it in connection with cocks, those yet so highly honoured vicarious sacrifices to Sol. In Wales it was necessary before this bird was sacrificed, says Pennant, that he should be led thrice round a holy well and then round the church, perhaps only because this stood in the place of the old Klachan. Poor epileptic ones—women or men—were scarcely less cruelly treated; for after being also marched three times round the well, they were made to wash and give offerings, and then prooeed to the church and there pass the whole night under the Communion table (the sacred stone?); with their head on the hard Bible as the only pillow. If they survived this—no small trial, seeing what wretchedly damp, cold places these Highland klachans were for poorly-clad creatures, in even the best of seasons,—then they were required to leave a suitable offering and go their ways. 1 Cf. All the Year Round. Aug. 1873, where vari-ous good authorities for this are quoted. 2 Dr. Reeve’s Adam. Vita St. Col., p. 423. 3 Tour in Wales, II. 15. "},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 274In 1794 we find the Rev. James Robertson, minister of the parish of Kal-ander (a good Sivaik name), relating the following important phallo-solar ceremony, as one occurring under his own eye, and to which he desires special attention, because he says, “such old rites are fast wearing out.” It used to take place every Beltane or 1st of May, and was, he thinks, a covert way of selecting “the devoted person to be sacrificed to Baal, whose favours they (his good Christian parishioner?) mean to implore in rendering the year productive of the sustenance of man and beast.” All the boys of the town-ship meet, he says, on a moor, “cut a table in the green sod, of a round figure, kindle a fire, dress a repast of eggs and milk in the consistence of a custard, knead a cake, and toast it at the embers against a stone (evidently the Lingam or sun-stone), in the centre of the klaclum or kirk, and then break it in pieces and throw all ‘into a bonnet,’ having first put a mark on one piece. Whoever draws this piece is “devoted to the Lord’”—that is, “shall surely be put to death” (Lev. xxvii 29). The Keltik pastor here adds: “There is little doubt of human sacrifices having been once offered in this country as well as in the east, although they now pass from the act of sacrificing, and only compel the devoted person to leap three times through the flames.” I have mentioned the sacrifice of the cock by Kelts; it was, and still is, over all Asia the cheap, common, and very venial substitute for man. The princes of India can afford the Aswa-meda or great horse sacrifice, and a Syrian patriarch, a ram “caught in the thicket,” and burn it instead of his child on the mountain altar to “the mountain Jahveh, but it is more common now to see the morning announcer of “the Sun of Righteousness,”—the impetuous king of the village middens,—being quietly conveyed up the mountain pass to die for his Lord, instead of a man or child. Many a time have I followed the sacrificing party up some sacred defile to the summit god, and watched the pitiful gaze of several poor followers who saw, not without some dismay, their favourite and beautiful bird—the no inconsiderable increaser of their peasant stock—about to be sacrificed by having its blood spattered by cruel, priestly hands over their “Rock of Age,” the Tsur-oo-Salem,1—here a sacrifice to Kāli —that queen of all bloody and savage rites/ The poor owners had. never probably been asked, or if so in a way which brooked not refusal, if they would yield up to their deity, the cheery announcer of their uneventful days of labour; for in general the selection falls on the finest bird of the village, and the actual sacrificers are rarely those who lose anything by the transaction. In this I speak of the customs of rude Indian tribes, not of orthodox Hindoos, but such sacrifices were also common to, and performed in much the same way, by Phenicians, Skyths, Sueves, Jews, Greeks, &c. The horse was also sacrificed by all peoples at some period of their history; and not so long ago either, in Scotland, for Col. F. Leslie notices the fact of one being roasted between two Beltein fires in the Hebrides;2 but the cock has been the enduring favourite, and cruelly though he has been treated wherever a Sabean or phallic altar has been raised, 1 Is. xxvi. 4, Tsur Oulemin but cf. xxx. 29; xliv. 8; li. 1. 2 Early Races, I. 128."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 275be this amidst the forest glades of the Bālees of Ceylon or the bleak rolling sands of Gobi, or of Arabian deserts, his pre-eminence has been acknowledged. As an emblem of a world-wide idea, he still divides the right to rule on the temples and spires of Christian Europe, and on the humbler shrines of many nations, with the Crescent of Isis and Arabia, and the TAU or Cross—that ancient “wood of health.” The rites of our Keltik forefathers were in close correspondence with the most cruel of Sivaik ceremonies; nay, the western race seem to have been more savage than the eastern, whose warmer clime had perhaps tamed the spirit, if it heated the sensual nature. Lucian says, the Kelts tore the palpitated hearts from their fellow creatures, in order to try and read the decrees or will of heaven,1 and the Mexican solarists did the same. Every tree in the Druid groves of Marseilles, says Lucian, was stained with human blood, and all good orthodox Gauls were most indignant with Cesar for overthrowing their shambles, an instance of the necessity for outside pressure to move faiths onwards; and even of the uses of wars and unjustifiable invasion. It is a weakness of new faiths to retain the old objects, and even the old ideas, whilst changing their names,2 and this fact makes it very difficult to find our way amidst ever-varying terms, even if we know the ideas, and are well up in the old customs of the new masses, and the blinds or veils of their priests. Christianity, like her predecessors, never attempted, till master of the situation, when it was too late to wipe out the effects, to disregard any old festivals, objects, rites, or holy places; all were fish that came to her net, and helped to power, for this essential; the means were a secondary consideration. We too teach that a statesman must do the best he can, though not all he would, nor exactly in the way he would—that compromise is of the essence of good government; all must give and take who would advance their race. Christ accepted the Mosaic errors, temple, and rites of his tribes, and preached, if not wor-shipped, in the synagogues, and his followers, mostly Essenes, retained their caste and rites. There was no “Christian orthodoxy” during the first two and a half centuries, such as is now preached; the ’Doxies were those of Essenes, Ebionites, Marcionites, Gnostics, and other such “heretics,” who, it is argued, knew best what Christ and his immediate followers taught. The Gospels which those following Origen, Eusebius, &c., singled out as orthodox, and which after a time—300 to 400 A.C.—were declared “inspired,” were probably neither known, nor the narratives, as we have them, credited, till long after the days of the writer or writers of “Against Heresies,” whom it has been the custom to personify as one Irenæus or Eirenaios, “The Peaceful.”3 It is urged that this famous treatise—the first which mentions or quotes from the New Testament gospels—could not have been written before 215, and that, consequently, nothing was known till then of all the astounding statements which are so continually, 1 Pharsalia, Bk. III. 2 Wells, festival days, and sacrifices, &c., all in time received Christian names, and were ascribed to Christian characters. 3 Those who wish to thoroughly understand the untrustworthy evidence of early Christianity, should get the three following short papers of Mr. Thomas Scott’s series—Irenæus, Primitive Church History, and christian Evidences. It is very doubt-ful if there ever was such a person as Ireneus.

But we are digressing, for much more has to be said regarding the nascent superstitions of our bewildered and be-Christianized ancestors. Cats, hares, ravens, geese, the sacred Brahma duck of the East and many other creatures, all got much and strangely mixed up in the early faiths of our fathers, nor have the illiterate forgotten these yet; they were potently manipulated by priests and witches go as to grievously distract the race, and often threw poor inoffensive indi-viduals into the hands of cruel officials, who knew no pity or remorse. Cats were considered at all times “uncanny,” for one never knew whether or not they were disguised witches. Hares, also, were avoided for the same reason, so that the Keltik pastor had no need to tell his flock to refrain from eating them, on the mistaken grounds of the Scriptural prohibition, though such could never really have been accepted by a people who, like the disobedient Shemites, delighted in cud-chewing kine. Colonel Forbes Leslie knew a gentleman who actually fired a crooked sixpence at a hare because he believed it to be a witch; he thought he missed the hare, but the neighbours would not admit this, and produced an old womam who, it was asserted, had been wounded at that very moment, and the sportsman believed it, though a doctor was officious enough to whisper that she was only suffering from rheumatism. It was not safe, even in the seventeenth century, to play with cats. A poor woman of evident proselytizing propensities, but probably good intentions, at least towards feline witches, and acting on the Christian principle of punishing sinners in a puxgatory to save them in eternity, had her cat duly baptised, and named after a Christian Saint, Margaret; she then passed it through a gate, as the best-known regenerating process, and “cast it to the devil,” but the Church repudiated the baptism and refused to receive either regenerated or unregenerated witches, for it believed in the cat superstition. It therefore summoned before the High Court of the realm, not only the old woman but two others, and a man who abetted the regen-erating process, and had all the four burned alive! The goose, said our forefathers—doctors of theology and bishops by the score —grew on trees and driftwood, having their eggs under their wings in a hole. provided by nature for this purpose, and it was therefore highly sinful to roast a goose, though in time, some bon-vivant abbots and friars, shrewdly associating the evil-born bird with Saint Michael, at once satisfied the spiritual and carnal appetites of them-selves and their flocks. “In the year of our Lord 1597,” an old woman, and three accomplices, stuffed a goose with four or five kittens, and set the dainty dish before a Mr. James Johnstone, in order that he might be cured of certain ailings by partaking of merely “the juice and drippings.” The four culprits were brought before the moat learned judges of the Scottish capital, and “after a good and true trial,” which duly proved the stuffing and roasting, they were sentenced to be strangled and burnt on the Castle-hill of Edinburgh., which sentence, “was duly carried out.”1 1 Pitcairn’s Crminal Trials, II. 29."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 277The records of the Christian churches condemning the current faiths and practices of the people, show us as truly as do the writings of the Jewish “Prophets,” what the masses really believed in and practised at the time they wrote, and probably before this. In both cases there was progress upwards, from barbarism to civilization—politi-cally, morally, and religiously, for it is a great fact, however priests may argue differ-ently in order to establish their untenable theories of primal purity, temptations, and falls, that man has, upon the whole, ever progressed, though fitfully rather than uniformly; for occasionally and even for a generation or so the tide has gone back-wards in many respects, but always to surge forward again; and the Jews, like others, have been no exception to this rule. It cannot be conceded that any—Aryan or Shemite—emerged on earth with a pure spiritual and monotheistic faith; and then fell back, to grovel in all those gross phallo-solar impurities, which Isaiah, Ezekiel, and other writers, from the 7th to the 4th C. B.C., describe as the most indubitable fact in Jewish history. An unbiassed smdy; in the light of other known similar Eastern faiths, amply proves the truth of this general rule, and we must apply these conclu-sions to Christian times, testing the statements of all writers who would have us be-lieve in the very sudden and early conversions of Europe and its relapses. Many say that Ireland was converted in the sixth century or so, but by carefully looking over the dry records of orders, statutes, punishments inflicted on the disobedient, and complaints against irreligion, we see that this is far from the truth. One or two facts, such as the following, however much they may be explained or softened down are crucial, and would be fatal to the early conversion theories. The records of the Irish Church state that so late as the seventeenth century, Laoghaire, a king of the land, was slain by his people, “for having violated the oath he had sworn by the sun, the wind, and the elements, showing a very firm and practical belief by his Irish subjects in those old deities, and consequently in Solo-phallic gods generally. The St. Columba hymnal also of these and later times asserted that “Christ is my Druid,” meaning sorcerer, saviour, or diviner, and St. Patrick’s Lorica freely invokes sun, fire, and wind for protection “against women, smiths, and Druids,” which, according to the quotation from the Columba hymnal would include Christ. The histories of our lands teem with quite modern tales of the doings of the gods, but especially pidesses of mountain, flood and field, or, as these are commonly called in Scotland—though seldom mentioned without some trepidation, “Kelpes.” The water Kelpe of Glendarvel was an important and typical one. She was called the old Kaileach Veir, or Beither, and dwelt appropriately “by the Great Stone,” or highest peak over-looking the glen. She was the daughter of Grain-na, but a forgetful one, for she neglected on one occasion “to close her fountain with a magical stone,” and the consequence was the flooding of the great vallies now known as Lochs Ech and Aw, in Cowal and Lorn—a figment which will be transparent to all who have studied this work or Indo-Aryan literature. As Colonel F. Leslie says, it reminds one of Indra and "},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 278Vritra, and curiously enough, Beither is in Gaelic the thunderbolt, and also a dragon or serpent—Indra’s symbol and favourite garland. Water Kelpes take the forms of Bulls, Cows, Horses, Mermaids, &c., and have been seen, say many reverend writers, even in this generntion! The clergy believed in them in the last century; at least no one contradicted the reverend parson of Kil-muir, when he wrote in 1736 that he disbelieved their existence in one of his lochs because there was there “too small an extent of water.” Another clergyman says the sacrament had not been dispensed in the church of St. Vigeans from 1699 to 1736, owing to the general belief that the water kelpe disliked. the sacramental rites, and would sink the church into the abyss. It was said the kelpe had carried the stones to build this klachan, and had rested them on bars of iron, over a lake of great depth; and when the sacrament was resumed in 1736, “hundreds of the parishioners placed themselves on an eminence at the opposite side of the ravine, momentarily expecting to witness the anticipated catastrophe;”1 and not without reason, seeing that they had many traditions of sunken kirks, and were even shown such submerged buildings and assured that they had been engulphed because sacreligiously built over their dear old klachans. The sacred circles also got buried occasioually, whether by nature, neglect, or the new priests, one or all, we know not. One circle in the Hebrides has been unearthed from below fifteen feet of good peat moss, and the altar atone has not yet been reached,2 so its age must be very great; probably older than those circles the Roman invaders found nineteen hundred years ago. St. Austin is said to have got the permission of King Ethelbert, in the 7th century, to use a sacred circle in which that monarch had worshipped, as a burial place; which shows that the practice had then begun of the new proselytes seeking burial in their own old and sacred places; and hence the cause why we find so many “Druid remains in kirkyards,” leading many writers to reverse matters, and say that the circles were originally burial places. This request of the pious Austin was clearly, however, part of the system of attack which the new faith had laid down as a standing rule; for Pope Gregory had told his faithful army never to destroy Pagan temples, but to consecrate them by sprinkling them with holy water, so that the people “may more familiarly resort to the places to which they had been accustomed:”3 They were also to be allowed, as was their wont, to sacrifice cattle “about these churches,” and. in 1656 we find the Presbytery of Dingwall, Ross-shire, denouncing the continued “sacrifice of Bulls,” “pouring milk libations on hills,” and “adoring stones;” thus revealing the fact that the people neither esteemed nor misunderstood Christian Redemption-doctrines. Skandinavian Norsemen in the Orkneys adapted the Keltik temple of Stennis to the worship of Thor,4 apparentIy on th.e principle that “it is better to believe too 1 Early Races, I. 147.   2 Early Race, I. 202-206. 3 Bede, p. 141.

I have alluded to the Irish and Scottish fanes being places where official matters were transacted. Kings and chiefs, doubtless, entered too into compacts at klachans—Skone, for instance—as Saul did at Gilgal, and as our “Chief magistrates” do, on the Westminster Stone. It has been so all over the world. Homer, in the “Iliad,” seats the elders “on a rough-hewn stone within a sacred circle,” to discuss that judicial matter which Achilles’ shield depicts; and the Odyssey repeats such rite in the case of the council of Alenious. Chardin speaks of similar circles for Persian councils.3 Moses raised his by the cone of Sinai, as soon as he knew his Jahveh was there, and building an altar (Dolmen) under that hill, placed around it twelve pillars, answer- ing to the twelve tribes or great Patriarchs, each stone being thus a true moat, mot, (Phallos) or man. Joshua followed his example on reaching the land he intended to seize; but when he was successful, as at Ai, he raised a karn over his enemies, and for worship he ascended a Mount-Ebal—the rock or stone-God, and there raised an altar, over which no man had lifted any iron.4 Samuel could only judge Israel, and crown Saul, at places with circuits or circles, as Mizpeh, Beth-El Gilgal. &c., of which there would be no lack, though all would not be equally sacred, or at least popular. The Gods of these altars and circles were also the Keltik Tein and Tarnach—Fire and Thunder, whom Moaes worshipped at Sinai; and if the deities were alike, so also their fanes. What could be more like the Mosaic and later Jewish circles than the Rollrich and Brogar shrines (Plate VII.), and what more complete a picture of Mount Sinai, in miniature, and its first Jewish circle at base, than the T a m n a -v e r i e circle, or “Hill of Worship,” near Coul, in Aberdeenshire, of which Colonel F. Leslie gives so good a picture. The Hermon there, is a conical mount, 150 feet high, forming at top a flattish earth-fast-rock, and having at its base a stone circle or “Below Chapel,” fifty feet in diameter, with an altar between two upright lingams, reminding us of Shechem, that village Mons (veneris), betwixt Greal Ebal and Gerizim, or its model, the so-called “Shechem tomb”—Plate VIII., 2.5 Courts were held and Bishops presided at these Pagan holy places up to quite modern times, for we read that in 1349, at the “rising ground called Candle Hill (significant name), apud stantes lapides de Rane, or ‘at the standing stones of 1 Dean Stanley’s E.

The Druids appear to have simply stood at the foot of their god, and we can understand that they would have considered the later substitutes, paltry and unimpressive in comparison with their lofty and ponderous columns. These, too, symbolising their great creator—the Aigaichos, or Aigis-bearer, and pointing to high heaven, were held to speak in the solemn tones of the tiny oracle at their base; for the voice of the Arch-Druid was the voice of the God, under whose shadow he was. A word as to some of these stones. In Plates IX. and X. are given the leading gods of the West, amongst which towered over all, the great Shin-Ar or Sun-God, Loch Mari Ker of Armorika, which compares well with even its Kaldian prototype on the plain of Dura (perhaps they were of the same period), before which all the rude races of Mesopotamia and the most cultured of Babylonia, bowed down twenty-five centuries ago.3 That of Dura was 90 ft. high and 9 ft. diameter (probably at base), whilst the Loch Mari Ker is 63 ft. high, 141th. of this in diatneter or 421ft., and weighs 260 tons. It is now laid low, but I show it erect for comparison with many congeners—mostly natural productions, “over which no tool has been lifted.” I fancy, however, that the so highly-prized “bosses” (testis) of the Kerloaz Lingam, and some of the feminine symbols with mammæ are artificial. It is thought that the Kerloaz Lingam.—2921ft. above, and 12 ft. below ground—has had the “bosses” enlarged by paring away the stone, for they are more prominent than I like to show these objects, valued though they be, by “les nouveaux Maries.”4 In Scotland, Armorika, and throughout the East, such symbols have usually led to obscenities of all kinds, and of course the ruder the race the more gross the rites. We see from church records, that the cultivated were fulminating decrees against “the worship of upright stones” from the Council Board of Tours in 567 A.C. and Canterbury was repeating the same up to the end of the 7th century, and further researeh will, I daresay, reveal similar prohibitions a thousand years later; for the aforesaid Irish 1 Early Races, I. 299. 2 Cf.

In 1795 there was to be seen “in every district of the isle of Skye a rude stone con-secrated to Grua-gach or Apollo,” and still in this generation, the Sun is there lovingly cherished as Gruagach, or the “Fair-haired one,” and libations of milk are still poured upon hill-tops and rude stone symbols to his honour. All solar heroes were fair-haired; see the descriptions of Apollo, Krishna, and Christ; and thousands of years before these, Agni and Soorya of Vedic singers—long ere Vedas existed—were fair or flaxen-haired gods. Many “holy stones” and fragments of these, have been lost sight of, owing to rob-bery and removal from their old fanes by pious emigrants and new convers. I came across many instances of this in the East, and the two fragments of the Meka ark, one long enshrined on the Persian gulf, is a case in point. The cathedral authorities of Clogher acted on their old Keltik instincts, however unwittingly, when they placed that celebrated stone in their porch or gateway, for Siva is Dwarka-Nat, or “God of Gates” and guardian of the door of Life, as well as S t h a n u, who standeth on the ark or altar. Hence, too, the reason why, as already related, the newly-married ladies of Oxford once pressed forward to kiss the altar stone, after they had led up towards it with much caressing the God’s Vahāna, or vehicle—the white Sivaik bull, so kindly provided for such necessities as theirs by a countryman. The first Irish saint, like the first Christian emperor, had, says even saintly legend, a great regard for all Muidhirs or Sun-stones, as the Karigkroith, &c. If Constantine placed his crest on the old Apollonic lingam with a halo around it, so Chriatianised Rome struck a medal with Sol or Sar-apis, in his car drawn by four fleet steeds, and inscribed around it, Sanet Deo Soli El-aga-bal.1 The statement that the Irish saint injured. the twelve brass zodiacal signs of the K r o m - k r u a c h is not consistent with another statement, that he baptised his convert, the king of Munster, at the great Mudros called the Leach P h a - d r u i e.2 OLD DOCTRINES.—The ends of the earth are found to be knitted wonderfully close when we carefully study ancient faiths. It has been said that Kelts differed greatly from Indian Aryans in knowing nothing of the doctrine of metempsychosis, but the ancient Vedas knew nothing of this either, and both spoke of immortality.3 It is true that all nations have at oue time or another held, that the spirits of witches and the dead could 1 Issued in the reign of Heliogabalus.

Neither of these doctrines bave been very uniformly or firmly maintained, and we see the latter being now rather roughly than logically thrust aside by a strong and increasing body in Europe, with arguments such as the Stoics and Saducees used nineteen centuries ago. Great religious ideas are not arrested in their transmission by ethnological and philological distinctioms, but passing over such limits, pervade alike the Skuthic, Mon-golian, and Negritic races, and fall like Indra’s blessings and curses—his rain and his plagues on the just and the unjust,—and have not religions been too often like plagues in families as well as nations. Although some similarities in languages prove linguistic affinity, however far apart the tongue may be spoken, yet, says Pritchard,1 clearly chafing under the too prescribed bounds set by philologists:— “This by no means enables us to solve the problems of the nature of that connection, and “the same holds good as regards the resemblance of objects of worship, of customs, superstitions, and monuments. . . . Without any apparent inducement various races and nations in Central Asia and Western Europe have retained and cherished certain traditionary useages in defiance of powers and penalties, civil and religious. Condemned alike by rulers and by teachers—by Christians, Mussalman, Boodhist, and Brahman, despised by philosophy, denounced by religion, and persecuted by authority—these customs still survive, undefended and undiscarded. Existing by tradition only, they seem to have preceded history; yet even in the present day, it cannot be truly asserted that they are extinct in Great Britain. Intolerance and intelligence for once combined and supported by power, have for more than a thousand years been baffled in all their attempts to root out superstitious useages which ignorance dares not openly approve, and intelligence unhesitatingly condemns. Without any defenders in that long period, these customs have offered no apparent, only a passive, resistance, against which, however, the ceaseless attacked of many enemies have vainly spent their force. This of itself might attract attention to these super- stitions.” It matters not what the recognised faiths of nations were, or the degree of their cul-ture, all at one time recognized the necessity of a sacrifice of blood, before the Almighty One would yield to his children what they wanted; whether the wish was for offspring, success in war, a happy life or prosperous joumey; whether the God was required to calm the violence of the sea, or assuage the severity of the climate, give good crops, or bless the erection of a house, temple, or mere flagstaff; or contrariwise, do the very reverse of all these, the penalty must be paid, and prayers fervently offered in faith, “nothing doubting.” These doctrines have been believed sincerely, unhesotatingly, and universally up to this time by the inhabitants of palaces as well as caves, by men of the most considerable culture, as well as by the lowest in the grade of humanity, and irrespective of all religious names and teachings. That “poor specimen of a king and a Scotchman,” James I. of England, though our authorized Biblical dedication makes him out so good a Christian, could undertake nothing without his sacraments 1 As quoted in Early Races, II. 486."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 283and sorcerers; these were even then, thought in some way to rule the winds and the waves, yet, hapless sorcerers! they could not save themselves from being occasionally strangled, tortured, and burned. Latham says that “all Christian nations retained more of their original paganism than they care to own; and few Churchmen, even the most faithful, and they of the 17th century A.C., care to disown the innumernable and absurd miracles attributed to them.”1 Christianity vied with all early faiths, and by no means unsuccessfully, consider-ing that it appeared at a more advanced period of the world’s growth, in all kinds of austerities and mutilatiom, even unto death. Colonel F. Leslie says, that “if self-immolation were not in some cases encouraged or practiced by early Christian saints of Ireland and Kalidonia, their ecclesiastical biographers have done them more or less than justice;” and he clearly points out how similar the customs of “the aborigines of India and Albion” were; comparing his ancestors with even the Indian Konds, whom it was so long the custom to decry as savages par excellence, but who do not look so bad in the light of ancient Alban story. Konds, too, worshipped the sun and moon, and heavenly host, and something else, just as “God’s chosen people” did; and they faithfully kept their word even unto death, and defied alike rewards and punishments; and in character were and are courageous and generous, which is not the popular view regarding “the chosen people.” Konds also faithfully worshipped the Earth goddess, and fully sympathised with the instinct or emotions which led the Kelt, when he fell, to jump up, turn thrice sun wise, describe a circle round his feet, and dig a hole in the ground to let out the injured deity, or free himself from an evil spirit. He could also vow sincerely with Job2 that his beart would not be secretly enticed to Astarte, and that neither would he point a finger to any heavenly orb, becawe this phallically signifies much, and is thought to cause serious evils. If Jews had Jahveh, El, and “The Rock of Ages,” Ebal or Eben-ezer, so had Gonds; for in every village, says the Rev. Dr. Stevenson,3 there, was a Trinity of gods, repre-sented by three stones, or some rude statuary; and Kelts were not outdone in this respect. The “Arrow of Summons” of the Kond patriarchs, was, says Leslie, the counterpart of the later “fiery cross” of the Kelts; both required peremptory and instant obedience; and both races might have hailed from the same land, for “in Shetland, until a comparatively late period, the arrow was used,”4 but the Kond first dipped his arrow in the blood of the sacrifice, and then in fire, to sear and harden it, before he sent it abroad on its mission of war. Konds, Kelts, Armorikans, and Skands all alike revered wells, rivers, mountains, and weird-looking rocks, or other strange natural objects, and especially worshipped these at solar and lunar phazes, and with fire and Sivaik rites;5 nor has Christianity 1 Descriptive Ethnology, II. 36. 2 Job. xxx. 26-28. 3 Col.

In the former, a pious Christian congrega-tion, after Confession, walk three times—of course sunwise—found the holy fount of St. Anne of Auray, and the return “to their devotions.”1 So Cumberland rejoices in a sacred spring at the west end of the Church of Kirkoswald, close to “the great circular columnar fane,” called “Long Meg and her Daughters.” Instances are not few of prayers and gospel readings beside, and sometimes in honour or worship of various British springs, and this down to so late a period as the seventeenth century.2 We still see Hermi or stone heaps, and often a sacred tree covered with rags—the pious offerings in olden days of very poor pilgrims—near to the holy wells of Kelts, as well as Gonds, and not a few of both races have gladly sacrificed their own and their infants’ bodies by dragging or pushing them through stone clefts; these, if as sharp as that of Fyvie in Aberdeenshire, were so much the more valued by both races. Menhirs were erected near wells and in ponds and swamps, which are Arghas, and Bretons prayed to such stones for rain, particularly to “the M e r l i n ,” a true symbol of Siva, as the Argha-Nāt. Islands, especially if they had any grotesque rocks and with a good well, were emblems of Isis or Ceres, whether at Thebes, or Lough Derg (county Donegal), where slumbered the “H o l y I s l e,” known as “P a t r i c k ’ s P u r g a t o r y,” a place sorely disturbing to both church and state down to the seventeenth century. It was evidently an old Kuthite shrine, and during Christian domination, up to 1632, was presided over by an abbot and forty friars, and visited daily by about four hundred and fifty pilgrims, who each used to pay 8d for admission, so that the islet shrine was wealthy, the proceeds being about equi-valent to £16,000 per annum, in these days—no trifling sum in so poor a country. The religious services in connection with Holy Wells in Ireland were called Patterns, and were usually addressed to St. Columb, St. Bridget, or St John—the Tubher IOn or Dove—these names being all Christian adaptations of the Pagan originals;3 but the god or goddess was always, if traced to the root, the Sun, male or female. Thus Elizabethan wells were Eliz-bets or Eli-ains, “houses,” “wells,” or “circles” of Elisa or Eloi, whose mount we have at Arras, as well as Limoges, where in the sixth century St. Elizius was very celebrated. Tot-en-ham had a grove of oaks and a holy well sacred to St. Eloy,4 just as Tan-hill of Midhurst in Sussex had a well and chapel sacred to St. Ann, or rather St. Tan or Ceres—a form of Tan-Tat, for whom Cornish men used to burn fires at Beltane, Midsummer, Hallowed Een, and Yule or Christmas. Hence Yule, as has been already explained, is Suil, the eye of the sky, and pronounced Huil, the Gaelic knowing no H as an initial; the frequent interchange of H with S, and the silent dh, require to be borne in mind in all Keltik researches.

We can only fully appreciate the subject and the many important ideas here involved, if we bear these terms in mind throughout our studies, and lightly esteem the current orthography and pronunciation of these days. 1 have here and elsewhere purposely varied the spellings of many familiar words, notably so the names for God; calling the orthodox but erroneously termed “Jehovah,” Yahveh, Yahweh, Jhavh, Ihuh, Ieuh, Ieue, ’Aiā, &c., where this deity seemed connected with neighbouring gods, as the Greek Iao, Iaou, or Ieuo,1 or the Keltik and Dravidian Iar, or ’Ar; so, too, in the case of “High Places,” as Ier-oo-Salēm, for we are thus often reminded of many historical facts, as that Aithiopians once ruled as well on the “High places” of Hebron as in Dravidian India. Where, indeed, have these not left the stamp of their language and genius? Yea, in many more places than historians have yet discerned. There are in England alone about fifty parishes named directly after Bel or Baal, and hun-dreds connected by name with his rites. At Ipswich, the large common, now known as Bolton, was dedicated to Fire rites, and these were practised throughout our islands, in spite of all prohibitions, up to the beginning of last century. Bel-teine fire fetes are still kept up, as joyous times of assembly, by the peasants of the Harz, Westphalia, the Rhine provinces, and in Bavaria, Swabia, &c.; and the Noth-feuer as Easter eve is called, and 23d of June are the great occasions when the meetings are always as noisy and vociferous as were the Bacchic routs of old. The rites consist of singing, dancing, and whirling about of blazing wooden wheels—Suns—besmeared with pitch, upon high poles; though only a wooden image is now burned, instead of the human victim of early days, yet down even to modern Christian times, a poor silly old woman, dubbed a witch, was occasionally then sacrificed. Highlanders, or Aram-eans, whether Jews, Syrians, or Kelts, have been the most inveterate upholders of such rites, a sketch of some of which as practised in the Bavarian highlands, so late as Beltine season 1875, is given in The Illustrated London News of 27th June. Kelts attached as much importance to “Friction-produced-Fire”—the Tein Egin—as Parsees. In some places they constructed a fire-wheel of straw, and conveying it secretly to a hill-top, there lighted and rolled it down, so that the popu-lace might believed it was kindled by the sacred solar fires of heaven.2 Only from 1 “The true pronunciation has long disappeared.”—Smith’s Dict. of Bib.

At midsummer the sacred fire-pole was accompanied by a serpent, showing that Kelts understood that Apollyon, “The Destroyer,” must now in-crease and their Saviour decrease, for Scorpio was soon to preside over an autumnal sky. The moon had a most powerful influence over our ancestors, and not without some reason, as her phazes appeared to mark periods of fever, and other important things. In our fathers’ days, the pious and sickly used to visit, especially at lunar changes on Sol’s day, sundry wells and springs, and derive untold benefit therefrom, and though this age of strong faiths has passed away, and we look to doctors instead of healing pools and lunar phazes, yet not in Eastern lands only, do people still bow before Astarte. Many British Christians, as well as the iconoclastic Mahomedan, still drop on the knee, curtsey, or ask a blessing on their frienda and themselves, as the moon passes through her courses; and many occult things are still done relating to her in matters procreative, and still in connection with the phallic Menhir, or Sunstone, and sacred trees. Aubery, in his Miscellanies, says that maidens desiring to see their future spouses, place themselves “on a yerd-fast (earth-fast) stone, with their backs against a tree,” and there sit until they “receive the light of the first new moon of a new year,” and “the success of the plan is vouched for on two occasions” ! In North Ronaldshay, one of the Orkneys, people assemble at moonlight, on the first day of the year, and dance before a huge upright stone, situated on a raised portion of the plain; and the same takes place round a. Menhir of Croisie in France.1 Strabo noticed somewhat similar Kelto-Iberian practices taking place at every full moon, and I have done the same in many parts of India. The Lowland Scotch used then to visit such holy wells as that in the cave of Uchtrie Macken, near Portpatrick. One of the most picturesque parishes of Cornwall is called “Bal-Diu,” “God- Ba-al,” or Bala-Deva, the Indian Herakles; and Bal-Diu found an able advocate and defender of his ancient fanes, and good interpreter of all his rites and mysteries, so far as these can still be read, in the Rev. William Haslam, the “Perpetual Curate” of that sequestered parish; see his valuable little work, The Cross and Serpent, now some quarter of a century old. Baladeva is one of Siva’s names, meaning “the strong,” “the upright one,”” here exactly such a character as this reverend writer de-picts his Shemitic type—the demi-god and Patriarch Adam, for Mr. Haslam endorses the Moslem and Arabian traditions respecting the latter, which describe the “First man” as “tall and erect upon the earth,” which “his head reaching unto the seventh heaven or the abode of Deity,”2 a correct description of Siva, when, in his contest with Vishnoo, he becamse a great upright column, reaching through several heavens, and spouting forth fire, like his emblem, the Egyptian obelisk.

Now the sun is represented as both Noah and Osiris,1 and Adam and Noah were frequently identified as well as worshipped, so that this reverend gentlemans researches justly lead him to consider all these persons as very often the same, and mere male types of the Ark or Crescent-Moon—that vessel of Noah, and “emblem of fecundity;” that Adam also is so described to us by both Jews and Gentiles, see p. 188 of Vol. I., and elsewhere. We have considerable detail of Adam-worship in Fragments from Commentaries on Scripture, by Hippolitus, Bishop of Rome,2 where the rites and services are shown to be similar to those of Osiris and Isis, although the good bishop seems very ignorant of the real import of much that he describes; his narrative is, however, natural through-out, and reads like a modern description of Solo-Sivaik rites in India. When the ark was ready, Noah, he says, made a door “on the East side,” and then “entered the Cavernam Thesaurum,” or “Cave of Treasures,” with his three sons; but first Noah took the body of Adam, and his son’s gold and Incense, and carried all “to the top of the holy mount,” and there set it up and worshipped. They then carried it down, and “Noah entered the ship and deposited the body of Adam and offerings in the middle of the ship upon a bier of wood,” when “God charged him saying, make for thyself Crepitacula (Sistrums) of racmc, Shamshar (Sagh, the Indian plane), also a hammer or bell,” and “strike the Sistrums three times a-day,” at dawn, noon, and sunset. This Lingam shrine was thus orthodox even as to noisiness. “The Mast was in the centre of the boat” or cell. and the worship was acoompanied with the jingling sistrum of Isis as well as the bell, just as at these fitting hours it still is, throughout India. The Chrfutian Fathers termed serpent worahippers “Noachites;” and the learned editors of the writings of Bishop Hippolitus, explain that probably the word Noach comes from the Hebrew cjn, “Na-ash,” a serpent, so that Kelts, with a faith and history full of serpent mythologies;. would readily accept such Noahism, and all stories like our “St. George and the Dragon.” This last would seem to them but their own old Druid legend of the dragon overthrown by an incarnate deity, but who eventually, in connection. with water (baptism or purification by Dhuna, Yuna, Jon or I-On,) was expected to bring about the “Redemption of mankind.” Our present tale of St. George (M’Kāl) and the Dragon was amplified by the Crusaders from old Eastern legends, where probably, the Apocalyptic writer of chapters ix., xii., and xx. also drew his in-spiration. Spenser, in his Faerie Queen, gives us considerable details of a Dragonik war which he is supposed to have obtained from some primitive sources of information not now discoverable.3 The fight there lasts three days, and the knight—St. Michael —is overthrown, but into “The Well of Lyfe.” “ Which fast trickled forth a silver glood, Full of great vertues and for med’cine good. . . . . . . For unto life the dead it could restore; And guilt of sinfull crimes cleane wash away.” 1 Cross and Serpent, p. 67. 2 Ante-Nicene Library, VI., Hippol. Refutation, I. pp. 491, 492. 3 Rev. W. Haslam, Cross and Serpent, p. 253."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 289From this “Water of Life” the Saviour of the race (Sol) emerged, refreshed and ready for the fray, and assailed the Drngon again with. his “Bright deaw-burning blade,” and so vigorously, that he made “a yawning wound on his head.” Again, however, he was overthrown, but he prayed to “the Tree of Life,” which healed him, and finally to that other Sivaik Tree—“knowing good and evil,” when he was enabled to overcome the Evil One. Thus in this and other ancient northern traditions, we find that long before Christian teaching arose, the idea of “a Well of Life,” and of “Trees of Life and of Good and Evil,” and of a divine “Sword of the Spirit,” were common, and they are continued into Arlhurian days; for King Arthur is said to have obtained “a diamond sword” from “a mysterious lake,” and “a silver shield” from “the cradle” of “the incarnate Thor;” which shield “was round, and had three dragons emblazoned on it”—a protective sign also with Trojan heroes. In Ireland, serpent faith and myths existed, though the reptile had there no habitat; Christians said that their patron saint—St. Patrick—had actually driven all serpents from the land, perhaps because other traditions had said that “St. Paul plunged a great dragon into the sea by throwing his stole”1 over it—a womanly symbol over the Divinity of passion; or because a nearer saint—St. Code of Bretony —had driven forth serpents from his country. The relaters of such legends had lost the meaning of the symbolic reptile, and were but crystallizing allegory. So in Cornwall, St. Michael, under his Druidik name, was conqueror of the dragon long before Christianity or the fanciful Apocalyptik writer lived, and there the deity was revered and his legends honoured, when those recorded in “The Revelations” had become despised by many churches.2 The earliest legends of Cornwall show that MAHA-KAL, the dragon god, was known as “the Roche”—“The Rock” or Tsur of the Hebrew, and the Cornish mount has long ago been called his “Hoar rock in the Wood.”3 The highest peak of Cornwall, “the Tor” or “Rough Tor,” as well as the highest peak of Ceylon, and, indeed, the highest cones of most mountains,—were called after Siva; and Michael’s hill, “the Beacon,” gave his name to an extensive parish. Every Christian church built over his old “Pagan shrines in Cornwall” was named after him, and all natural and artificial cones in Bretony, writes Deane as quoted by Haslam, were “sacred to him, and Christians have invariably so consecrated them.”4 Nay, Mr. Deans congratulates his fellows on the constant memories of this deity which Christian structures still exhibit, adding, “they exist on all the doorways and outside fonts. . . . Many ancient churches throughout the three realms of Norman and Ante-Norman foundation, bear . . . these signs of triumph,” which he thinks were “most significantly . . . placed, especially on the doorways and fonts,” . . . as symboliz-ing “the appointed means of victory and deliverance”! He knew not that Siva, whether as Sol or Serpent, is Dwark-Nāt or “The God of the Gate” of life. Near “the ancient 1 Cross and Serpent, note, p. 238. 3 Siva, as the Dragon God, is the Ahir-bundha—Ser-pent or sage One; cf. pp. 249, 250, ante. 2 Luther and other considered the book spurious. 4 See Haslam, p. 247.

Ophite temple” of Avebury, says Deane, the font has, “on the east side of the bowl, the figure of a bishop with mitre and crozier, . . . and on each side of him a dragon, whose tails flow round the upper part of the font.”1 Haslam says that evidences of Maha-Kāl especially abound about Tintagel, a region which “has an island of the sea at either end,” and is therefore such a spot as Phallo-Solar worshippers always select. “Tradition gives Tintagel to King Arthur,” that is Ath-Ur or Ar-Tor, “the fabulous and incarnate deity of Druids, answering to the Thor of the Skandinavians.”2 Besides having two islands, one at each base, Tintagel “is a rocky eminence, rising boldly from the sea on all sides,” so that the cone and islands make the whole a sort of Kerloaz stone, a natural Pharos, or Phallos; and that it was so viewed we see from its name, Pen-Diu, hend or “point of the god.” It is “black and rugged; and the sea below is black also in the greatness of its depth. On the bold foreland are several rock basins, and not far from them a spring or well of alleged mystic efficacy, and near it a narrow cave.”3 How clearly the topography points out the Divinities! No guides are neces- sary to tell us what God was worshipped on this cone and island, or what goddess in the mystic well and hallowed cave. Every Druid shrine, says our Reverend guide, had a well and also such emblematic accompaniments as a wolf, squirrel, and mys-tic tree—that Skanclinavian symbol whose serpentine roots of passion reached down into what they called Hell or Hades, and whose centre was the earth with all its joys, anxie-ties, emotions, and dangers, but whose lofty branches were in a supposed joyful cloud-land, presided over by the eagle of Jove or Vish-noo. This figure, No. 255,—a fine ideograph regarding which we shall have much to say in the chapter on Skandinavian faiths, will help the reader towards grasping these ancient ideas. Diana, the bright and cheerful Day goddess, is here seen bounding or rambling midst the boughs, under her character as the huntress or hunted hind, whilst the spirit of heaven—Nim-Rud, the chaser, Zeus, Deus or Yahveh—nimbly passes to and fro everywhere, from the hellish depths to the celestial summits, guiding and controlling as a ubiquitous but scarcely observable power, all the universe of man and matter—from the heavens above to the earth beneath, and all the waters and supposed hills below this again.

Mr. Haslam wrote: “There is not a town or village, in early times, which had not its sacred tree, the virescent emblem of a deity. . . . It was the place of vows and contracts,”1 and therefore an emblem similar to the Heap or Hermes, the “Thigh,” Beth-El, or Grove of the patriarchs, or temple-pillar of Josiah. Beside “ the isolated Roche of Cornwall, with its chapel of St. Michael on summit, its rock basin and healing well, there was an ancient stunted elm, called the Witch Elm, . . . from which, within the last twenty years, persons have begged small branches, on account of its healing properties.”2 “The Christians,” continues this clergyman, “supplied the place of this accustomed tree with the village cross and tree (the italics are mine), the former for solemn vows and resolutions, and the latter for social recreations,” which shows us that here too the cross took the place of the Phallik king, whilst the tree reverted to one of its earliest social uses—the trysting-places of all peoples. THE CERES OF KELTS.—Ceres of the serpent car—the real cause of all worldly prosperity, of which population is the sine qua non—was par excellence the serpent god-dess and the consort of Dionysos, Osiris, Toth, or by whatever other name men called the primeval great god of Agriculture and “Increase.” Without the serpent car the life of man, it was thought, was vain, and therefore most early temples pre-scribed, that as soon as the Neophyte entered on his full manhood, but not before, he could partake of all the joys of Ceres. As soon as Triptolemos, the founder of the Eleusinian mysteries, had learned agriculture, he was presented with a serpent car, that so he might dispense blessings to the world—a kind of picture-acting which needs no explanation. The Irish harvest month of Corn and Plenty—August—is called after Ceres’ consort, Toth or Tat, signifying “the Bread-giver” or “Increaser,” that is Joseph. The woman on the circle, or Luna in Sol, was depicted very variously by Kelts, as in that rude figure from the Rev. Mr. Maurice’s Indian Antiquities,3 or that given by Montfaucon, from a sculpture in front of the temple of Mont Morillon in Poitou,4 or this shockingly coarse one unearthed from the ruins of the tower of Cashel in Ireland, which Mr. Marcus Keane, who kindly gives it to me, says, is an “emblem of female nature, the ‘grove’ of the Scriptures and possibly ‘the Fiedh-Nomadh’ of the Irish.” Fidh or Budh, signifies the Linga, and Nemphe, Nemphed, or Nemhedh, the heavenly, holy, or consecrated thing,5 or “Wood,” for these articles, male or female, were always primarily made of wood, as we see from the abundance of wooden phalli our sailors still bring from China, Japan, &c.

Cornwall should have been rich in such, but I cannot remember seeing anything more important than some so-called Egyptian relics and numerous coins of the Ptolemies. In Exeter, however, in 1853, a bi-frontal bust of Isis was found in a ditch, and in Devonshire considerable quantities of ancient jewellery, but nothing else I believe, have been discovered. In a deep cutting made in the town of Penryn, in 1850, two bronze bulls were found; but the most remarkable find was this find sphinx, dug out in 1821, near Colchester, in Esseex, and described in the Quarterly Journal of Science of 1822 by Mr. C.W.A. Hay.1 My engraving is reduced from one published by Murray in October 1821, and shows us a monster, clearly emblematic of the old faiths, as sitting upon, perhaps destroying, an older sect, or presenting a new and more intelligent offshoot. 1 Vol. XII. 66, p. 1 and following.

Romans depicted this sphinx upon the coins of Comalodunum or Colchester2 when it was the capital of their province of Trinobantes —the first Roman colony of the first century. The faith-ideas of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, muat have indeed been strong and widespread, when men so far north thus sculptured and engraved them so boldly. This stnmge and gigantic figure has the tail of a serpent (here by an oversight of tho copyist almost missed out, but very voluminous and ponderous in the original); the body of a dog; the wings of a bird; the paws of a lion: the all potent hand of a man—Siva’s emblem turned upwards, and the head and breasts of a woman, whilst the whole creature firmly crushes or “broods over” a fine intelligent, manly head. In the days when, according to Sophokles, the mythic Haimos loved poor Antigone, who for his sake was entombed alive, these were all living emblems of a strong faith which permeated every thought, rite, and act of Theban religious life, and that such should so long remain safe on British soil, shows that these ideas and emblems were also consonant to those of our country-men, or that the Roman world had Keltik ideas most intimately allied to ours. BEL AND SERPENT.—The priest of the great Solar God Bel, whose prophet was Bal-ak in Jewish writ, was called Bel-ech by our Keltik fathers, and we have seen that Ak, agh, ech, as well as Tak, Hag, Nag, Shak (as in Tak-shak), have all a serpent or “Bel and the Dragon” signification. So those who worshipped Bel, Jove, Apollo, or Jahveh—for they were the same god under different features, also had Mol-ech, ek, ak, or och, to which even the Morbihan of Annorika bears witness, for close to the Bourg of Serent, famous for its serpent remains, there is a commune called Molak or Moloc, which has also become a family name.3 Near the oracle of Bela or Belz, clearly Belus, the Christian Missionaries are said to have had to expel serpent worshippets, though they retained much of their faith and practice, for, says the Reverend Mr. Deane, with his usual innocent frankness, “they sacrificed the consistency and simplicity of the Chris-tian religion, and hence we see the serpent, the emblem of conservation, carved upon the exterior of churches, as that of Laudevan, Divau and others; hence also the intro-. duction of the Sun and the serpent into ecclesiastical processions.”4 The Keltik God worshipped at Nantes, that city of obscene Roman remains, was Boul-janus, or Baal and Janus,5 the Phallik Bel. Apollo, said Cesar, is the Belenus of Gauls, and Bel-i-sama (“Queen of heaven”) is their Minerva,6 and in his day the Bel-gæ were Kelts par exellence, and fervid wornhippers of Bel, but all good Gauls were Kelts, 1 Apollod. iii. 5.

But the Belides ware alao the Danaides,3 and one Palamedes, of mythic fame, whom Pliny says completed the Greek alphabet with the four letters Q, S, F, C, was with Greeks “The Belides” or great Son of Belus.4 The Jove of Rome was El or El-eus, B-el, Ba-al or Belos;5 and who so worshipped by Romans, Greeks, and Britons, as Bellona, the goddess of war and sister of Mars?6 Her priests, the Bellonarii, at Comana in Capadocia, numbered, says Strabo, six thousand persons, and their High Priest, second only in rank to the Monarch, was always chosen from the royal family. At Bellona’s temple in Rome, every general had to present himself on his return from war; and at the foot of its Lingam column, which stood in front of her fane, as it still does in the East, and ever did in the remotest West, the Roman soldiery flung down the national Quiris, thus emblematically emphasizing a vow, that they would not seek their homes and connu-bial joys again, till they returned victorious to reclaim the manly symbol. This pillar of Bellona was termed “The Warrior,” and beside it foreign ambassadors were received by the Roman Senate, and here all wars were declared;7 and thus, too, northern Kelts acted, at their sacred phallic shrines or stones, as at Tara, Skone and Westminster. During the historic period, Bellona’s greatest shrine in England was at York, and the rites there were very similar to those prescribed for Diana, of whom she was a form, for Diana was called Baal-Tis by Phenicians, and Bel-tha (Luna) by Arabians.8 Herakles, as the Sun, was called Baulus at Bauli in Latium,9 and Belus, Bali, and Bali-Ram further East; and Belus was the Son of Nepture, and the mythic founder of the greatness of Tyre as well as of Babylon and Asyria. If Phenicians knew him as Ba-al-Amon, Ba-al-Shamaim, Bel-Adon or Adonis, their neighbours rever-enced him equally as Bel-Osiris, Bel-Ochua, Bel-On, Bel-Orus,10 Bel-Apis or Soorya or Ser-Apis—the God of many lands, and the Taurus of the celestial system. He was enshrined in Christian Canon literature as Saint Serapo or Serapion, and so sculptured on many a sacred Christian tablet, and in 1770, a stone was dug up in York, dedicated to him in the words, DEO SANCTO SERAPI,—To God, Saint Serapis. A silver serpent represented him as the Oracle of the Sun in the temple of Isis, which proclaimed the will of the Deity, by shaking its head upon eyery occasion when any breach of the holy canons occurred.11 The earliest Fathers of the Church, who taught from that same land, gave most of these old attributes to their rising “Sun of Righteousness,” usally endeavonring to point out the complete resemblance between Christ, Sar or Soorya.

OPHITE SYMBOLS.—The worship, fear, or reverence which was bestowed upon sacred animals and reptiles, a. the bull, cow, serpent, &c., were also extended to all their functions, yes, even to their excretions; nothing pertaining to. them was impure, as is too often forcibly thrust upon our notice in passing through the temple courts of India, when any of the sacred kine are there.2 In the case of serpents, the most wonderful legends and a few facts come down to us regarding their saliva, mode of coition, sperm, skin, and eggs. Pliny forgetting his true vocation as a naturalist—a re-corder of well investigated statements—gravely tells us, in regard to the origin of the anguinum. or serpent egg, that this is brought about by “a bed or knot of snakes;” that “an infinite number entwine themselves together in the heat of summer, roll themselves into a mass, and from the saliva of their jaws and the froth of their bodies is generated an egg called anguinum,” and that “by the violent hissing of the serpents, this egg is forced into the air.” At pages 223 and 255 of my previous volume I have explained that this “rolling” and “entwining” is their mode of coition, and the hissing and provocation, that excitation or enravishment which many males adopt towards females whilst in heat, as well as to some small extent about the time of parturition, of which the habits of pigeons and many birds afford us examples. I have myself noticed anakes and guanos thus “fighting” and then occasionally found an egg on the spot; and in the case of house lizards, when similarly struggling with each other, I have actually seen the egg escape and roll to a distance, as well as some-times fall from the high ledge of a cornice in my room on to a table. The egg or its priestly imitation—the Gleini na Droedh of the Welsh, or Glaine nan Druidhe of Ireland, and the “Adder Stone” or Druid glass of the Scotch, has always been much prized, and was once revered by Kelts as “an object of Drnidical worship.” They were “either spherical or in the form of a lentil,” onion or fig,3 representing the female or male idea; such amulets we know to have been highly valued in all nations, and particularly so in various parts of Europe. The Keltik story of the production of the anguinum is like that given by Pliny. The snakes were said to meet at Beltine (midummer), “join mouths and hiss until a bubble was produced;” other snakes then hissed on this and blew it “in a ring over the body of a snake, when it at once hardened.” “Adder heads,” as we now have these, are usually of a green colour, but sometimes are blue and streaked with red and white, and “half the size of finger rings.” 1 Ante-Nicene Library, VI.

India too tells us very strange stories of the curative properties of serpent stones; the most valuable being those cut out very deftly from the head of a real live Cobra—a dangerous process, more especially as the sacred snake must on no account be killed, otherwise the stone is said to immediately dissolve. From Sutherland we have it reported that thousands of people once “mournbed over the surreptitious removal” from a church altar of a “stone of bright colours”—clearly an ovum anguinum, and we might multiply to almost any extent tales showing fear and reverence in regard to these matters; nor did such fears abate for ten centuries after the advent of the new faith. Christo-Keltik priests, of course, carried on the reverential feelings of their kindred who respected a serpent as a symbol of the deity whether on a pole or a stone, and as thoroughly understood the curative or beneficial effects of looking unto such, as did the Shemite wanderers in Arabia Petrea. That Druid priests took care Kelts should not lack figures of these on stone, wood or rock, we see by the many Ophidian forms figured in Archeological works. Note also that as the Druid priest was himself called the serpent or adder, the Nathair, Asc, or Aisc—Akadian, Kaldian, and Hebrew Hac or Ak—so the Jewish priest was named after the same symbol of his solo-phallic god, the Ben-Levi, or “Sons of the Serpent,” which the learned Jew, Dr. Goldziher,2 assures us is the signification of these words, the Levites being the guardians of the faith of the desert ophiolators, of which more hereafter. There are numerous most striking analogies betwixt the faith-developments of the Old Testament and many of those, scarcely yet dead, around us, but which flourished luxuriantly under Druids. If Jews required the intervention of such objects as Wands, Rods, and Almonds, Rachel’s “gods,” “images,”3 Teraphim or “Elohim” and shrubs like this Atropa Mandragora, or “M a n-d r a k e s,” to accomplish the purposes of Al-e-im, Yahveh, or Al-Shadai in the way of a special pro-geny, from whom a son of Yahveh was to spring, so also had druids such strange legends as to quaint sticks and shrubs, as the trefoil Seamrag or sham-rock (which St. Patrick so graciously adopted as his special favourite),4 the V e r v a i n, the S a l a g o, but above all the Mistletoe, which blossomed with Sol’s heat, and proudced seeds 1 Cf.

These were most holy and efficacious in the case of many very occult matters. All this the new priests of Alban directly or by silence accepted, only urging that the efficacy is greatest on their saint or festal days, as that of St John’s and other fire fêtes, to which no Druid could say nay, as these were also their own solar festivals. The church, with subtlety, told its too willing officers that it was not wise to look very closely into such matters, nor to too minutely question things which we call hierogIyphics, as those on p. 262, Fig. 252; though these were pictorial writings as clear to Druids, Kelts, and all Sivaites, as English letters to us. Why ask what the serpents were doing biting each other, and why fish were engraved kissing each other? Why serpents are common everywhere, and usually and affection-ately licking or kissing very quaint-looking fleurs-de-lis at one extremity of a diagonal staff, called the “Sceptre of Dominion,” and resting their tails on a very different figure at the other end? Why there is a bovine IO—the Argive deity, Hera Boōpis1—with a serpent as her horns? Why so many triangles with reduplicated oval apertures? and why two round balls are connected by another diagonal sceptre, with suspiciously phallic extremities, having an Isis or crescent Moon, with oval and dot at one end, and quite another thing, and no dot at the other? It was clearly not advisable for the mission-aries of a young and tentative faith to at once attack, nay, touch upon the subject of these symbols and the burning questions which any arguments here would have involved; and we may be sure they did not do so. In appearance, at least, they followed rather the Tennysonian precept of leaving to the people “Their early heaven, their happy views,” a selfish principle in reality, and such as the Church has never acted upon, or her dull heaven, and hell of fearful, unrelenting and unreforming torments, would not have found so much favour even with the ruder and fiercer races of the north. The new priests steadily though stealthily, worked for centuries upon the religious feelings of our forefathers, content with but indifferent success, until the race of Druidical priests had ben wiped out, when, in name at least, the people were won over to Christianity. It mattered little though they remained “Pagan Kelts” in reality; nationalities and numbers are the sub- stantial triumphs which all churches and faiths first, if not throughout their course, aim at; and hence the babe as well as the school-boy must be seized, so that the intellectual light of ripe and impartial reason—the terror of faiths—be blunted or benumbed at its source. None knew better than the early priestly teachers of man-kind, that even though a reasoning creation eventually emerge from the church chrysalis, it was almost certain to be dwarfed, deformed, and harmless, because carry-ing with it much of its old surroundings in the way of unconquerable prejudices due to these early teachings, and the natural fear of the mysterious. Of course the Kelts in time came to see and kindly acknowledge the superiority 1 About two thousand images of her were found at Mukēne, along with terra cotta distaff and spindle-like articles—“ex votos,” says Dr. Schliemann, as quoted in Times of 12th April 1877, “to Minerva Ergāne, ornamented with religious symbols, and with sometimes short inscriptions.”—clearly phalli.

It had great stores of miracles and mysteries, and its priests were masters in all that mytical converse and poetic picturing of the present and dark fture, which was a necessity of the devout Keltik nature. They also most obliginly only modified, neither sweeping away nor destroying the ancient rites, fêtes, and ceremonies so dear to our race. and which consecrared so many revered spots by mountain, hill, and stream. The proselytizers also exercised much caution, as it behoved them, in dealing with a religious, albeit aomewhat ferocious people, for so long as the Gael was “the strong man in the house,” that “light which lighteth every man” was ever liable to be very abruptly and sternly extinguished. By the time, however, the early missionaries essayed to convert the Albans,—the 6th or 7th century,—they were adepts, and their southern masters still more so, in the use of all those insinuating methods which rather shunned the strong and manly, and sought out the weakly and emotional members of families; they had proved that it was not difficult to win over a Clovis and his nobles, when Queen Clotilda and her more impressible court were on their side. A good deal has been written regarding “the sceptre shaft” or rod seen in these Keltik seulpturings connecting diagonally the strange phallic-looking object. A sceptre is the Sivaik symbol, and an orthodox writer, the late Mr Waring, timidly, but correctly says, he “suspects it is the symbol of the deity which connects the heavenly bodies,1 . . . . the Welsh bardic symbol of the name of god—the Awen or sacred A,” a form of the Indian sacred AWM, AUM, or OM. According to the Welsh, how-ever, if I read Waring aright, Menyw is “the son of the three shouts, by which the world is created,” and “the story of the three shouts” is also an Indian legend;2 and shouts are a highly IAKIK or Bacchic accompaniment of all phallic rites; three being thought necessary whether in shouting three or “three times three” as with us, or in “perfecting creation.” The circle or O, was held to represent Perfection, Sun, and Creation; M is water; and WM may merely mean reduplication in the sense of greater significance. CROZIER AND BATONS.—Scotland had great reverence for sacred Rods or Croziers, which she called Bakuls, Cogerachs, &c.; and for none so much as the Quigrich of St Fillan, he of the phallic bell, already referred to at page 232 and 350 of the previous volume. The “Saints Fillan” were numerous, and, in popular belief, are said to have, “founded a clan-monastery,” the missionaries of which all went about with Bakuls or pastoral staves, which have ever since been highly venerated, and quite as much so as in the time of Moses and Aaron. Even within historic times these bakuls had a vast repute, and the custodians of them were richly endowed 1 Stone Monuments, p. 45.

Thus the staffs of St. Molnag, in the Island of Lismore, and of St Lolan at Kincardine on the Forth, had extensive lands assigned to them. They were the apt representatives of the Obelisk-God, and never was obelisk in higher repute than was the Bakul of St Fillan or Fa-el-an, with the Kelts, of G l e n -d o c h a r t. In the 14th century it waa a religious fetish with King Robert Bruce, whose favourite prayer was “in the name of God and St. Fillan;” he usually carried a piece of the bone of St Fillan about with. him in a silver case, but the priest of Glendochart feared to risk this treasure on his battlefields, and just as we observe that the priests of Ceylon often hid away, on such risky occasions, the “tooth” of Boodha (query, was the bone in the Quigrich, a “tooth” or a Lingam?), so the Keltik guardians of the symbol of Fa-el-an, withdrew that fetish from the casket on the eve of the battle of Banokburn. When, however, victory declared itself for The Bruce, St. Fillan is said to have miraculously replaced it in the casket, so that it, and not Skotish valour, won tbat great national victory. One of the old names of the Crozier was Cath-Bhaiadh, or “Conqueror in battle,” because it enabled the Albans to conquer the Danes in 918, so that it exactly fulfilled the part of the “Rod of God” in the hands of a Moses, or Aaron.1 The potent charm was clearly the bit of bone hid away in the ornamented Crozier or head of the staff, which is now to be seen in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. It was a real Jupiter Fœderis or Mercury, as we see from the fact that it was used for swearing or making solemn vows before or upon; offerings of meal had to be made to it, just as rice must be offered to the Sri- Lingams of India, and as manna had to he presented to Yahveh—the Eduth or “Testimony.” Even in the end of the 15th century James III. bestowed on the holders of this Skotish fetish all the privileges and immunities which they had previously held in the days of Bruce, and confirmed these to their posterity. Let us here go somewhat fully into the history of the so-called St Fillan and his shrine. Near the furthest western source of the Tay, amongst the most rugged and lofty scenery of Perthshire, if not Sootland, where the sacred river starts on its far eastern journey, di-viding the high mountains of Ben Odhar (2948 feet) on the north, and Ben Laigh (3706 feet) to the south, lies the Skotish “Pool of Bethesda,” here called “the Holy Pool of Strathfillan,”—a centre for unknown ages of healing efficacy, of blessing, and supersti-tion. It is not situated quite at the source of the river, but at the place where the Druid and early Christian priests, said the water assumed its healing virtues, and near to this pool—site of the old Druidik shrine of Felan, Balan, or Faolan4—did the new faith erect its ancient church of St. Fillan, and appropriate the old Sivaik bell of conical shape and phallik handle, here sbown in Fig. 259. Truly as the Lord Bishop of Brechin says in his account of this bell, “the handle is the most remarkable part, for there we find 1 Exod. iv. 17; vii. 9; xx. 17, 9. 2 Exod. xvi. 33, 34.

FILLAN, FEL-AN, BEL-AN OR FA-EL-ON. twice repeated, the well known heathen emblem of the phallus.”1 He is led by the history of this relic to see that there never was a genuine “Saint Fillan,” but many Fillans, all called, he thinks, after a very ancient Felan, Faolan, or Foelan, whom Lord Crawford of Dunecht, his “learned and accomplished friend,” very justly thinks may be a local corruption for the name of the strong Keltik god Belin or Belinos, Bel or Ba-al, whose symbol was the phallos, “derived,” continues the Earl, “from the root found in the Sanskrit bal-a, ‘strength,’ Shemitic bal, and Pelas-gian POL-ere and VOL-ere.” In Sanskrit, we have Bhāla, “lustre,” from Bha, “to shine;” and in Old English, Bale, and Balefire, “a flame or burning.”2 The phal-los, he adds, “was the symbol of health, life, and regeneration,” and “carries the antiquity of the bell back to a very distant period, . . . linking it with Pagan antiquity,” though this identical bell may, he believes, “belong to Christian times.” The Bishop in reply repudiates this last slur upon Skotish and Irish Christians with a patriotism worthy of a better cause, for he adduces no good reasons in support of his argument; simply stating, “he believes that it belongs to either the bronze period, anterior to Chriatian times, or if Christian, that it has been imported from southern lands where the heathen ideas, living on into Christian times, were expressed in more definite forms. . . . It will be remembered,” he adds, “that St T e r n a n, according to the legend, received his bell from the Pope, and St. T eiliao, a bell, remarkable for its powers at Jerusalem (sic, and note the fetishism). It may be, therefore, that the bell of St. Fillan came from a land where no notion of coarseness was attached to the simulachrum,” and this seems also to have been the case with our ancestors. Only after a people grew out of fetishism, and a pure and simple “nature worship”—in which the organs of fertility are adored, and then their images, and adopt a higher though still phallic cult, as in solarism—do they begin to shun the old symbols and think them coarse; and this it is that the nakedness of the human figure, which shocks the unaccustomed eye of the European, has no effect on Asiatics accustomed to it from infancy. Lord Crawford writes thus to the Bishop, with a true appreciation of the matter:— “Taking this fact (that above cited concerning the phallos being the Regenerator) and the ornament on the bell, and the sanitory use to which it was put till seventy years ago, together, it appears to me either that the ornament was employed designedly to indicate the virtue always, indeed, supposed to reside in bells, or that such virtue was supposed, in a peculiar degree, to belong to this particular bell 1 Procs.

Ants. of Scot., VIII. of 1871, p. 265-276. 2 See Indexes, Fal, Bal and Phal, &c."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 301from the ornament upon it, at a time when the phallus symbol was still believed to have the power of repelling evil in Scotland as it long did in Italy. The symbol may appear strange as a Christan one, and yet, what is stranger, and what may illustrate my belief, that it was designedly put [although in a very modest and out-of-sight way] on St. Fillan’s bell, is the usage which prevailed at Isernia in the kingdom of Naples till nearly the end of the last century, and which perhaps exists still—and this with the full sanction of the Church—the useage, namely, of presenting and consecrating votive offerings of simulachra of this description moulded in wax,1 in gratitude for recovery from illness, to the two medical saints, St C o s m a s and St D a m i a n, at their shrine there. . . . I should not be surprised is St. Fillan’s feast was fixed by the early missionaries, on some day sacred on the spot to the Pagan god (Bel or Belin), for the purpose of superseding his worship.” The noble Lord’s views are very nearly my own, and they are sustained by the rites and virtues treated of in the modem history of this Christian or pre-Christian gem. It appears that an English traveller, in August 1799, found the bell so revered, that “partly in frolic and partly to abate the existing superstition, he carried it away” to his home in Hertfordshire, where it remained till the autumn of 1869, when Bishop Forbes, then on a visit to Lord Crawford, chanced to hear of it, as a curiosity to be seen at the house of a relative in the neighbourhood. The family agreed to at once restore it, and it was handed over accordingly, to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, in whose museum in Edinburgh, I examined it and made this sketch. In the Society’s catalogue and Proceedings (p. 273) will be found larger drawings, but the public are apt to be led off the scent in the Catalogue by the misleading remark that “the handle” is “double-headed dragonesque,” which was explained to me as “common to most old bells, but in no sense phallic”! I urged that it would be phallic even if “dragonesque,” as crested snakes and bells were well known male and female euphemisms in Sivaik lore, but was assured that all sound Scotch antiquaries held that the two very palpable Lings were but the crests of snakes, the protruberances, the eyes, and the division of the handle at foot, the open jaws, so made to more securely grasp the bell! that such a thing as this “horrible Pagan nature worship was unknown among our Keltik ancestors,” and, in this case was a specially absurd idea, the relic having been long prized by Christians, and only yielded up in 1869, “with the consent of the Heritors and Kirk Session of St Fillans.”2 This great treasure of St Fillans, said our trnveller of 1798, usually lay on a tombstone in that church yard, being, it may be supposed left there, to be ready for constant use by the sick pilgrims to the sacred pool. The hole seen in my sketch may have been caused by the kisses of votaries, just as the metal is worn away from the toe of the so-called St. Peter’s statue at Rome. The bell was only one of six im-portant treasures at St Fillans; there was first, the chapel or Druidik Cella; second, the healing waters of baptism in the sacred pool; third, the Yoni-stone adjoining the cella; fourth, the Crozier or Bakul; fifth, the sacred chair; and sixth, the said bell, which summoned all to adore “the Lord of Life.” All these had to be called into vogue in troublesome cases. Thus it was the sinner’s, duty—for the mad or diseased 1 An Account of the Remains of the Worship of Priapus . . . in the Kingdom of Naples. London, 1781. [Reprinted in R.

The topography and rites appear to bespeak the reigning deity, regarding which we have this traveller’s verdict as follows:— “A rocky point projects into the pool. Each person gathers up nine stones in the pool, and after bathing, walks to a hill near the water, where there are three cairns, round each of which he performs three turns, at each turn depositiing a stone, and if it is for any bodily pain, fractured limb or sore that they are bathing, they throw upon one of these cairns that part of the clothing which covered the part affected. Also, if they have at home any beast that is diseased, they have only to bring some of the meal which it feed upon, and make it into paste with these waters, and afterwards given it him to eat, which will form an infallible cure, but they must likewise throw upon the cairn the rope or halter with which he was led; consequently the cairns are covered with old halters, gloves, shoes, bonnets, nightcaps, rags of all sorts, kilts, petticoats, garters, and smocks.”—A fact in this faith, yet a non sequitur. Money was also often offered at the cairns, and the following was, continues our traveller, the regime to be adopted in the case of lunatics: A rope was fastened round their waist, and they were thrown into the pool, and then taken out and led to the churchyard of St. Fillans—“where there is a large stone with a nick carved in it just large enough to receive them.” The word “nick” is here clearly out of place; a cleft or Yoni-form is what is meant, and regarding which we can recall many paral-lelisms. “In this stone,” continues the narrator, the body is “fastened down to a wooden framework, and remains there for a whole night, with a covering of hay on it, and St Fillan’s bell is put over the head.1 If, in the morning, the unhappy patient is found loose, the saint is supposed to be very propitious; if, on the contrary, he con-tinues in bonds, the cure is supposed doubtful. . . . . The bell had an iron tongue,”—an important euphemism in this faith, and in some form common to all Palla-diums, but it was lost. The bell itself fell from heaven, and flew to Strath Fillan, and, adds “Popish tradition,” wherever it was removed to, it always returned by the morning to its Yoni stone, near Fa~elons’ cell, “ringing all the way,” The bell is of mixed metal, about a foot high, and exactly corresponds in Sivaik shape and appearance, though a little larger, with those we find in. Lingam temples in out-of-the-way parts of India. I have seen several such on Aboo and other mountains of Raj-pootana, and on the hills and plains of Northern, Central, and Southern India. Another account of the St Fillan rites in the case of mad persons, is that when dipped, they “were instructed to take three stones from. the bottom of the pool, and walking three times round three cairns on the bank, to throw a stone at each. They were tied 1 The “Old Statistical Account” says: “is put on their head with great solemnity.” In the original, “heads,” plural, occurs, evidently by mistake, as there was only one stone and one cleft."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 303to St Fillan’s bed in St Fillan’s Chapel all night” Thus the “throwing stones at the Hermes” was as common in this vale of Perthshire as at the Arafat cone in the vale of Meka, and tying to the bed at night is a well known custom in Phallic rites. Most Shemites so tie up the Paschal lamb, or the Bokra at the Bakreed. Saint Fel-an, Foil-an, Fill-an, or Fo-el-an, says Bishop Forbes, “is comme-moroted in Irishand Scottish kalendars” as “the son of Fera-dach or Feri-ath, a nobleman probably of the race of Fia-tach Finn;” reminding us of Pheni or Fins and their phallic lore, as well as the fact that Fiadha and Far-gha (mem. vir.) (in which dh and gh are all but silent) is “the witnessing Lord,” that Fi(dh) is the plural of Bu(dh) or the Lingam, and Fi (dh)-Nemph the heavenly Lingam.1 B is usually com-mutable in Keltik and all Eastern tongues with V and F, and P = F more or less aspirated, so that Fi is Pi, the organ or mouth-piece of the sun, and Fi-El is the Sivaik El, which we may writer and pronounce as Fil or F’el. Fo, or Bo, is an Asiatic term for Bodha or Budha as “Intelligence,” or “The Quickener.” In Hebrew we have Pal or Bal, as in Ba-al Peor (Irish, Lord of Seed), “the strong one,” “the plougher” or “ploughshare which cultivates” Terra; in Arabic he is Fal, Fale, and colloquially in old English, Tale corresponding to the Greek Pallo, “the shaker or hurler of the spear”—the Phallos, and Pallas,2 who with Hebrews was Peleg, “the Divider.” The “saint” or demi-god of this phallic bell, is then the solo-phallic fire god Pi-el or Pe-Or, and his bell is what we should expect as we recognise him so obscenely depicted amidst those remarkable sculptures at Niames.3 The “shaking” or tremulous idea is always attached to the Lingam-God, whether as the Tale, Clacher, or tongue of the bell, (which last is the feminine symbol), or as the distaf, spindle or pestle in the mortar, as the learned Professor Steinthal of Berlin very lucidly shows us.4 He says this meaning clings to the root of the name of P r o m e t h e u s, who is none other than the Indian Mathar-isvan or Pramāthyu-s, in which the root is math, with the fundamental sense “to shake,” and hence “to learn,” thig signification existing also in the Sanskrit word Bhud (Boodha), which, as the Professor adds, means “a shaking up or movement of the mind to and fro.” In India M a t a r - i s v a n is Siva in his form of Agni the Fire-god, Fire-carrier, or Fire-producer, which was the office of the western Pra-matha, the affix Pra being here “pre-eminent,” and only “Fire” as appli-cable to man in the sense of his being as Hindooism teaches, “the generating fire 1 Keane’s Towers and Temples of Ireland, pp. 296-299.

The long lists of meanings and compounds given in Liddell and Scott in connection with the Greek Pur, ranging from “fire,” “embers,” and “altars” to “pyramids,” would give us here considerable licence, but still more the Sanskrit and Kaldian tongues, there Pri, Prin, Pur, Pa-Ur, P’ur, Pa, P’al, Pal, P’el, Pi-el, &c., all proclaim the same Puro-Phallic and solar ideas. That the reader may more clearly see this, I give in another volume a glossary of Snaksirt words, including the principal names of Siva and Agni, the study of which will aid us much here and elsewhere; for when philological uncertainty exists,—and especially it does in the records of faiths—we must try and discover from the whole concatination of ideas, the original meanings which the grouping of the words sugges, and so get at the germ or Primum mobile of the old pietists. If the glossary be steadily perused there will be no difficulty in discovering this; indeed the most cursory consideration of the names of Siva, some of which are given in the margin will lead us to this Fons et origo, for he is Pra-matha “the trampling, violating one,” math signifying to “churn,” “produce,” “agitate,” or “ravish.” Steinthal and Benfey alike tell us that “the boring stick was originally called Matha and “the twirling stick,” Mathin, but that later the word Matha was only applied to “the penis,” and, thinks Professor Weber, it is the root of the Latin word Mentula; he might have added of Muto, Mudo, and Mudros.2 There is no difficulty, in treading philological paths where the lights are so strong. Continuing a descriptive narrative as to how ancient men first got at such ideas, Professor Steinthal, putting, in my opinion, the cart before the horse—for men and women had “fire” and the fleshy matha or pra-mantha before “spindles” or “churning sticks”—says “primitive man” fell to worshipping fire because he saw it faIl from heaven, alive in the sun’s disk, and hidden in the materials around him, nay, in his own self; so the pestal and mortar became “the male pra-mantha” and “the lower piece of wood,” or Argha, “the female eschara, or pudenda;”3 for “when the primitive man,” he continues, “figures to himself the act of copulation, it is the combin-ation of ideas of producing fire by rubbing, that enters into his consciousness, and gives him an apperception of that act.” Now though this mode of reasoning is rather from effect to cause than from cause to effect, yet the key is very nearly in the writer’s hand, and he here consequently sees and well explains to us the valuable myths of Prometheus and Samson. Phoroneus, he says, is Greekized from the Sanskrit Bhuranyu-s, the root of which is bhar, Latin bir, Greek Pher, which hence yields Phero-menos, “the fire-man”—that “fiery one” whom Hindoos say is Agni “in the flesh;” for Agni is also called Bhuranyus, as “the rapid, darting, flying one,” precisely corresponding 1 Hebrew Mythology, p. 388. 2 Note to p. 388. 3 Ibid., p. 370, 388.

In Jewish and Christian sacred writ, the Holy Spirit is commonly known as that most amorous of bird, the dove, and Mary was pourtrayed as impregnated by this bird—see the many coarse but famous pictures of the scene, especially that Venetian one given at p. 304 of my previous volume; see also Calmet’s drawings of the Jewish Cherub or flying “fire-man,” at page 480 ibid., and the Eagle-desks of our churches. According to Peloponesian story, it was a fire-bird and not Prometheus which brought down heavenly fire to men, and at Argos the holy flame was ever kept burning on an altar in honour of this fire-bird, which was “regarded as the father of the human race,” though originally only seen as a bird, the son of the nymph Melia, ‘the ash,’ and sitting on the celestial ash-tree, as in Fig. 255, p. 290, ante. In this Skandinavian idea, the bird presides over all the world of men and matter, and sends forth his messengers as Jove is said to do in Greek story from great Olympos—from a high Heaven of bliss above, to a hell of woe beneath, and so still from the eagle of our Churches go forth “the Words of Life.” If the reader turn back to Fig. 219 of page 87, he will see the same bird-idea in the cocks presiding over the Kal- dian arks of life, and in the still revered emblems of the Ta-ous on the Yezid pedestal, and the Hensas on all poles which surround the sacred shrines of Boodhists. In Vedik hymns, Agni is called “the golden-winged bird.” Vishnoo rides, or his spirit is borne to men, on Garooda, the eagle, while S a r a s v a t i, whom some Vaishnavas make Vishnoo’s consort,1 but who is usually called Brahma’s, and is a river of wisdom, eloquence, and music, is shown by Coleman as here characteristically riding a peacock or other solar bird of love. Siva as the Column or Cone is frequently seen amid the paraphernalia, rites, and emblemism of Lingam temples, pre-sided over by a bird-spirit, symbolizing persuasive,2 vivifying or creative fire, but sometimes an emblem of real fire is here given, as the Egyptian depicted issuing from the apex of his fire-symbol, the obelisk. The procreative god is constantly mixed up with tales and terms connected with the wagtail, as my Sanskrit glossary shows, and Hindoo nursery tales frequently allude to him as a bird. Latins too attributed their origin to a bird—the heavenly Picus, and called him the first king of their country, Latium, after him, saying “he was the first man and father of all 1 Garrett’s Clas. Dic. of India.  2 He is a “God of eloquence” as was Hermes, &c."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 306mankind,” and Picus is the deity who protected all mothers in childbed, and all infants; but we must return to our Keltik saint. A genuine saint, Fal-an—for of course there were many who chose so godly and revered a name—had as his instructors, I-bar (son of I,) Muna, and Desert, well known Eastern terms, and from these, says Bishop Forbes, come such Skotish names as K i l - m u n, on the “Holy Loch” in Argylshire, and probably D y s a r t, on the coast of Fife, once famous for its sacred weems or caves; a little north of the present Dysart, a whole district was called St. Phillans after the demi-god, and here—near to the town, fitly called Pitten-weem, a cave is still shown as “St. Fillan’s.” So in Argyleshire, near Lochlash, is a St. Fillan’s Church, but near to Killin in Strathearn, was the special seat of the cultus of this saint.1 In the oldest statistical account of this St. Fillan, it is stated that what “the people of Ireland and Scotland, as well as those of Wales, hold in great honour, is bells, handbells, (campanas, or baje-elas, an expressive Indian term) and pastoral staves, carved at the upper part and formed of gold, silver, and brass, so that they fear to take oath on these and to perjure themselves more than they do upon the gospels (sic). For contemners of these are often punished by a certain hidden and divine power implanted in them”—a statement which militates consider-ably against the supposed Christianity of the people down to very modern times. It is a common complaint among the better educated of all faiths, that the masses ever continue to seek after—in O. T. language, “commit whoredom with”—their old symbols, “high places,” and rites. Many good Mahomedans have thus bewailed to me the degeneracy of their less educated brethren, when I have pointed out strange periodical worship in the old “High Places” of their land, though called now “the tombs of Peers” or saints. On several occasions I personally investigated the histories of some of those “High Places”—usually to be found on hill-tops or remarkable spurs leading to a high summit, or in a lonely seqnestered nook at the base—to satisfy my-self that they had no connection originally with the modem Peer-story. They were all shrines of the old Fire or Nature worshippers of the land, which on the Moslem conquest and part proselytism of the people, had lost the old symbols; they neverthe-less continued as places where “everlasting fire” must burn, and prayer, with fruits and flowers, be offered up, more especially on the old high days and holidays. St. Sophia at Constantinople, St. Peter’s, our own St. Paul’s, and many others, are all temples on similar old sacred sites of early races, and even here the old cells, emblems, and ideas have not yet been quite buried.2 The same tales come to us from Syria. The official reports of the Palestine Surveying Expedition of 1877, state that “the High Places” are still the scenes of the most interesting matter in regard to the old faiths of the land: “an oath on or beside them is still considered more solemn and binding than one before Allah” or Yahveh, so enduring, as their sacred rocks, are religious superstitions. Bishop Forbes clearly recognises the Phallik faiths of Kelts, remarking that 1 The Bishop is responsible for these statements as to the localities of “the Cultus.” The name is everywhere apparent. 2 The Cell and Yoni-hole under Ripon Cathedral is a case in point."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 307though he has never before seen the Phallik symbols “on any Scoto-Irish metal work,” yet that we see precisely the same in the stone Menhirs, the worship of which “still survives among the cognate races in Brittany”—he might have added, “and those nearer home.” He saw at Dôl, in Brittany, “the corn in a field at the foot of one of these tall stones, crowned indeed by the cross, yet crushed by the knees and feet of the votaries who came there to be cured of sterility.” In the same volume as that he writes for, we are told of a remarkable Lingam stone which used to stand in the centre of a horse-shoe shrine, on the island of Bearnarey, in the Sound of Harris—Hebrides. It was a “Rocking Stone,” but was at last broken by boys rocking it too severely. Mr. A. A. Carmichael says it stood in a large semi-circle facing the east, near the centre of the island, at a place called Killaisem—thought to mean the Ciul, Cell, or Church of St. Asaph.1 The horse-shoe of St Peter’s with obelisk in centre, and great cell or dome behind, is the child of this older faith, topographically and architecturally. The base of the Bearnarey “obelisk was surrounded with a heap of small beautifully white and variegated pebbles,” . . . “the offering of pilgrims,” and close by “stood one of those old circular Duns so common in the Hebrides,” with a cell or chapel, galleries or passages. This word Doon is but the Hindustani Jon, Ion, or Yoni, the name of Par-vati, “the Mountain Goddess.”2 A heap of stones at the foot of an obelisk repre-sents precisely the same idea as the Hermes or Karn, “topped with the handsomest stones which can be had”—an object common all over Asia, and one here accurately described as seen by Lieut. Dundas, R.N., on Easter Island, South Pacific. Here, too, Meta-s or Hermai are put, he says, around or near all planations, as a “sign of Taboo,” that is as a charm or fetish,3 which Mat or Mut—a symbol of Man—in India signifies. St. Fillan had not only the rod or crozier, but a sacred Cadeir, Cathedra, or chair, being a revered rocky-hollow which still marks the site of the old monastery in Glendochart,4 and Dr. J. Stuart, the then secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, tells us that such rods and chairs were common to all Keltik chiefs. Dr. O’Donovan adds, these had to lay aside their weapons at inauguration ceremonies, and then received from the Brehon of the district a straight white wand, which they held in their hand, when sitting or standing by or on the sacred stone, for all stones with sculptured feet were sacred; “St. Columbo’s, about a mile from Derry, was one of those stood upon,” and, says Dr. Stuart, “appears to have been the consecration stone formerly placed at A i leach, the great seat of the kings. St. Patrick blessed and set it apart for this purpose.”5 Such stones, wrote Spenser, 300 years ago, are commonly placed on hills and streams. “O’Neale’s Chaire” is a rock on the hill fort of Tullahog, Dungannon; so the “chair of the Kings of Man” is still seen on Tynwald Hill; that of St. Marnan, near to his church on the banks of the Deveron, and that of St. K e n t i g e r n , in his monastery on M a l i n d i n a r B u r n .

As the Holy Mount of the God was not always convenient for inauguration ceremonies—his special seat is indeed usually held too sacred for any feet save those of his priests—so we leam in the case of the Skone Coronation, that the rites took place below or adjoining to the Mons Placiti. Dr. Stuart justly appreciates and calls particular attention to a very old sculpture at Dunfalandy in Athole, “consisting of two men, one of whom bears a rod, sitting in chairs with a cross (on a Mount) between them,” which he says “may be a conventional representation of a height or Moot (Math) hill . . . and the inauguration of a Pictish chief of Athole, who sits on one chair, with the tanils or heir-apparent on the other.” He adds that “the delivery of a rod to a newly-elected chief was one of the ceremonies at Hebridean inaugurations.”1 The cross on the mount is an Argha-Nat or trans-figuration symbol or mannerism of the god, as transfixed on or in the Omphe. KELTIK OPHIOLATRY.—There is not as much evidence of phallo-serpent wor-ship, myths, and legends in Central Europe as in the north and the coast provinces. All Sauromātāi and Skuthik peoples and their offshoots, and all Hyperboreoi, were well known to Greeks as fervid Ophiolaters, and Greek and Roman history frequently relate the descent of these, whom they ignorantly called barberous tribes, to lay their offerings before Pytho-phallic and fire shrines. The names of some of the priestesses, as Argis Oupis, Eva-On, &c., who visited the shrines of Lukeus—the Light-God—in Delos and elsewhere are very suggestive of their faiths. Troy was said to have owed its Palla-Dium or Linga-Deva to the Hyperborean Abaris, who formed it out of the bones of Pelops, the Pi-el-ophis, and possibly we here see the idea which put Fa-el-on’s bones into a Rod, and kept it near St. Fillan’s Well. In the name Ab-Ar-Is also we probably see Oph-Ar-Is, the “serpent-god-Ar.” and in Ab-Ar the old “Father-God Ar,” Al or El. The first social anecdotes we have regarding Sarmatians (the Sauromatia) and Samagitai, or Muskovites, connect them with the worship of Trees and serpents. They always kept serpents in their houses, and diligently nourished and cherished them, even up to the 13th century, A.C. In Lithuania, or modern Poland, it was at one time, death to destroy a serpent or guano, and in every house these were reverenced and worshipped by the people in the same degree as did the Latins their Lares and Penates. Jagello, the last Pagan duke of Lithuania, was only converted to Christianity some five hundred years ago; and if the nobility only changed their faith then, we need not be surprised that in the 17th century, ophite objects were still preserved and reverenced, and that the faith of the people is still very grossly superstitious. In the beginning of the 14th century Jerome of Prague said, that all around him the people offered sacrifices to serpents, keeping them in every house, and giving them their food with great care and reverence. Kromer says the same of the Prussians; and Koch, quoted by Deane,2 affirms that the Livonians offered their most beautiful 1 Proc. Soc. Ants. of Scot., VIII. 103. Cf. Matha, p. 304 ante. 2 Serpent Worship, p. 247."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 309captives to sacrifice to their serpent gods. So far as I can read history, all the southern Baltic coasts, Central and Russian Europe, were occupied by strong and per-sistent serpent worshippers down to a few centuries ago; but Skands divided their reverence and fear, or faith,1 equally betwixt trees and serpents as symbols of fertility, and amid such sterile aspects of nature, this is what one would expect. In the scale of civilisation also, they—Fins, Swedes, and Norwegians, were considerably lower than the Solo-ophites of the Mediterranean states; so also were their confreres, Vandals, Lombards, &c. The Danes were a seafaring, bold, and more advanced westerly branch of the Skands, yet as sailors and islanders highly superstitious and among the foremost of Northern Ophiolators; they always fought under a Dragon standard like their Norman cousins. It was at Tandera in Denmark that the celebrated “sacrificial horn” was discovered in 1639, and Mr. Deane attached much importance to it as an index of the faith of Danes and Holsteiners. It is in gold, embossed in seven parallel circular compartments, in five of which is a serpent in various attitudes; nude figures are offering prayer and sacrifice to it, and conversing with it. The Vandals and the Alans have necessarily left traces of Ophiolatry everywhere. I have shown that they were powerful eastern races, who, setting forth in quest of new lands so late as 409 A.C. swept like a tempest across central Europe, down through Spain, along the whole North African coast, and from Carthage in 455, reached Rome and the neighbouring coasts and islands, and of course respread the old faiths far and wide. They were known everywhere by their appropriate standard, the flying dragon. In their nursery lands betwixt the Volga and the Danube, and near the higher Cau-casian steppes, the dragon or serpent was in every Vandal and Alan house abjectly worshipped and carefully nourished on milk, or kept by priestesses in hollow oak stems —the true symbol of the Phallik Jove, Tenarus, and Toth. Imperial Rome saw also another race of great serpent-worshippers desolate fair Italy—the Lombards, neigh-bours of the Vandals, who finally took possession of Lombardian Italy, so that what with them and their conjoiners there, and the phallo-ophite Etruskans and Sabines in the South, we need not wonder at the re-invigoration on such congenial soil of the old faiths. These had in fact been always more largely and firmly embraced by the masses than the present which not a tithe of so-called “Christians” comprehend. The old and the new religions were alike thaumaturgical and spiritualistic. The name of the Asyrian serpent god was retained by the so-called Druids of Britain, for these speak of their serpent deity Hu (whom Gauls worshipped) as the Dragon Ruler of the world, and his priests gloried. in the name of the ADDIR, written Gnadr, pronounced as a nasal.2 One species of British snake is called Hak, which is thought to be related to the English word Hag or witch. An African sorceress is called Obi, and the witch of Endor was Oub, “the one,” says the Rev. Mr. Deane, 1 Fear, Faith, and Religion were somewhat synonymous terms.

Tacitus and Cæsar clearly knew a good deal about him, recognising him in every pillar which capped a mound or headland.4 He was a contemporary of the British Molech, that large osier or timber idol, into which were thrown or entwined, as the Rev. Mr. Rust shows us,5 all those victims which the Druidik faith required to he burnt as expiatory sacrifices for sin. Oub, the witch of Endor, and the Obi of Africans and Tatars, were but poor samples of the great Ophite priesthood of Egypt who dominated in that land from Thebes to Heliopom or On. Usually the serpent priestesses of the temples of Ra and Isis were, if perfectly human, depicted as in Fig. 262. They car-ried the deity in their hands or about their persons, or “in canephoræ on their heads, to declare their divine mission,”6 or as at Eleusinia, in “sculptured arks” and baskets, which were scrupulously hid away in secret adyta or Sacristies, the nature and surroundings of which we see in this Serapian one, Fig. 264, from a Greek coin. this was the model from which that of Jupiter Serapis was made. The Ureus, (from Aur, Light), says Mr. Cooper, “is always represented in the feminine form, and is used as a symbol of fecundity,” and being so, it “is often alone figured,” as is the Yoni or Lingam of India. It is tedious or superfluous to always repeat whole figures, so the priests held that “in representing the mouth they depict the serpent, because the serpent is powerful in no other of its members except the mouth alone,”7 and this is why we often find only the organs depicted, where a male or female god of fertility, as this of Rano,8 the “goddess of good-ness or plenty,” is meant. Rano is here a dual idea, in which the erect reptile with the testis, is the male, whilst the breasts or eyes, are Ceres, and the quaint oval head, Sophia, Wisdom, or the Yoni, as seen in such figures as 9, 85, 106, &c., Vol. I. 1 Serpent Worship and Lev. xx. 27, Deut xviii. 2 Deane, p. 95.

It matters not whether the serpent is that now known as the Asp, the Coluber or Ureus; the meaning—Passion and continuity of the species—is the same, and this ancient Egyptian tablet of terra cotta is a case in point, for here the god, as “Eternity” or continued fecundity, encircles Mary or Isis and her rising Son, an idea often repeated by Christians, and already somewhat fully dwelt upon; we shall however give more illustrations of this important phaze of thought, but at present must return to Keltik Europe. Skandinavian and British Druid stories are, towards Christian days, replete with the destruction of great serpents which following mythic law, would as the live reptiles were gradually discarded, come to signify the destruction of great Ophite chiefs or shrines. The Greek story of the Kadmian dragon and cave is surpassed by the Yorkshire one, which relates that the Manor of Stockburne is still held upon the tenure of exhibiting to the Bishop of Durham a sword, with which a monstrous dragon was said to have been slain.1 Again, looking south we are reminded that it is but a few generations since th ePhins of Finis-terre were veritable heathen, and when a “pious and indefatigable priest and missionary (Michael le Nobletz) went forth to convert them.” Their worship was then concentrated upon an extremely indecent statue, Petros or Lingam, on the tower2 of the Church of St. Pierre—one quite in keeping with that observed along the headlands of Armorika. Thus from east to west, and from north to south, the result is the same and as “history repeats itself,” future generations may similarly condemn us, not perhaps for sensuous immorality in religion or life, but for gross bigotry and belief in superstitions, which to them will appear as dismal and as surprising as the impurity of those earlier faiths now does to us. Some Christian Finisterians, and all their Peninsular brethren, are still as super-stitiously and bigotedly engaged in the worship of Pārvati (Mother Mary they call her), or sacred mountains, as of old; yes, and at the old and similar shrines. In The Times of the 9th October 1876, it is stated that annually some 100,000 to 300,000 devout Christians still flock at the solar Equinoxes, to the holy hills—Hermons and Zions—of Spain and that he who doubts should be at Barcelona in the early part of September, where he will see some 10000 devotees (but an eighth part of the annual crowds) streaming by rail and road up towards the jagged peaks of conical Mo n tserat—the Mons Serratus of the Romans, because their priests have told them that an image of the Virgin Mother of their God has there reposed for a thousand years. The Times correspondent described the hill “as the most sacred mount in the Christian world, (a wide assertion seeing there are so very many),—a sheer pile of rugged rock standing up and alone out of slopes of vineyards and pine forests.” Of 1 Deane, p. 268.   2 Early Races of Scotland, p. 265."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 312course the old Irene, Vandals or Iberians, had worshipped around this phallic emblem a thousand or thousands of years B.C., yet it is taught and believed, says this writer, that “the rock was only upheaved and rent at the crucifixion.” The A s h e r a or god-dess who now presides on its heights, was hid away, say her priests, from iconoclastic Saracens and buried deep (as on such occasions was Boodha’s tooth, its male congenitor), in a lovely hill-side, from 717 C.E. till “one night in the year 880, when a shepherd, guided to the spot by a light1 from heaven, found the deity” and proceeded to trans-port it to Manresa. this however was opposed by Heaven, for whilst the image was passing the sacred cone, it became immovable—a sure sign that the mountain-god besought his queen to there abide with him, and accordingly the present holy shrine was constructed. “It has had its days of grandeur,” continues The Times correspondent, “for here once flocked for a blessing well nigh all the crowned heads of Europe. Charles the Fifth visited it nine times; John of Austria, twice; Rudolfo of Austria, twice; Philip II. of Spain, four times; Alonso III. of Catalonia, constantly; Pope Benedict XIII., twice; together with thousands of others of royal or ducal rank. The monastery, too, had its three or four hundred monks and many nuns; it boasted, too, distinguished sons, such as Bernado Boll, friar, who, with twelve monks, accompanied Christopher Columbus in his second voyage to the new world. It claims the merit of having sent the first Patriarch to India. Here Ignatius Loyola, MArch 24, 1522, spent a whole night in prayer before the Lady of Montserrat; here, in 1702, Philip V. knelt for four hours of the nihgt watches at his devotion before the shrine. In its glorious days, in the 16th century, confessors of all tongues were massed together beneath the grey walls of the monastery to receive the sorrowful and sin-laden of all nations; children were healed of all diseases; and Garcia de Cisneros, the abbot, became the king of a religious republic. “But the glory of Montserrat departed, although as late as 1857 Queen Isabel II., Don Francisco, and the Princess of the Asturias visited the shrine in regal state, and left at the altar gold and pearls and costly robes.” There are three very holy caves connected with this temple which must be piously visited by all pilgrims, “The Virgin’s” “The Devil’s,” and that of “Juan Garin, the prayerful monk,” who, however, owing to an apparent weakness of Juans, in the presence of Virgins and Devils, forgot himself, and was “changed Into a wild beast, but eventually restored to humanity by the voice of a child of five months old.” Do the myth-makers mean that this awakening to sense, occurred when he found the cares of paternity beginning to manifest themselves to him? for this is then akin to the stories in several faiths, as in Zoroastrianism, where Yima, the Adamite prototype, falls through the temptations of the serpent, alias passion, when he and his Virgin become demons and produce wilt beasts. “During this evil period,” says an able writer,2 “women much preferred young devils to young men for husbands, and men married young and seductive houris or female devils.” So Adam is made in the Talmud to have had as his first wife Lilith, a daughter of earth, who seduced him by evil night-dreams, &c., until from the union arose devils, ghosts, and all evil creatures. Eve also loved devils, but she was here held to be Adam’s second wife. The myth is patent; these serpent-women are those hydra forms which all Heraklai are depicted as 1 Like such legend is our story of the Star of Bethlehem; and many a very similar Eastern one. 2 Thomas Scott’s series, 1876, The Serpent in Paradise and the fable of “the Fall,” page 20.

They seduce Adams by such ideas as that represented in Fig. 8, where the kiss and the apple are prominent features. The Lilith of the Hebrews is none other than the Arabian Queen of Night, Sar-rat ha Lilat, afterwards Al-il-at. Liat, says Talbot, is a pure Asyrian word for night, and also signifies Venus or the star of love. The Greeks said that the moon as Ilithya was sister to Apollo, which was also the relationship of Yimi to Yima, both in the Vedik and Zend story. Osiris and Isis were not only brother and sister, but twins, and said to have been married in the womb of their mother. The Zend sacred writings caution “all good men from sleeping alone, for fear of the evil Lilith,”—advice which recalls to our mind that of St. Paul in regard to bachelorhood. In the rites of “Our Lady of Montserrat,” we see as still in use, the tree, serpents as “streamers,” and divers fire symbols. The Times corrspondent noticed that “every one coming back from the shrine bore in hand the Ramo or bough of box-tree with red streamers, gay tinsel relics and wooden spoons and forks dyed crimson:— “Relics,” he adds, “blessed by the monks or friars in the chapel, tied to and twined amid its foliage. These box boughs are six feet high; the ribans, trinkets, and streamers are purchased and tied to the bough, which is carried to church the next Sunday, and then placed over the rude settle (sic), where it acts as a charm and preserves the househould in health and safety until September comes round again—just as the palms are blessed in Andaluisa on Palm Sunday and twined in every verandah for a twelvemonth.” All the pilgrims and worshippers carried wax tapers, grand tall phallic candles or torches, “to Our Lady,” and the church within and without was ablaze with these just as wen the Persian shrines of old. The ribands or serpent symbols “are of silk, and exactly the span of the Virgin’s head, and on them is printed ‘Medida de la cabesa de Nuestra Senora Maria Santisima de Montserrat.’—i.e., exact head measurement of Our Lady of Montserrat. On the little papers sold as memorials of the day is printed:— “ ‘The image of the Virgin, which to-day we worship, was pointed out to some shepherds, in the year 880, near this steep, by miraculous lights from heaven. The shepherds told the priest; the priest told the Bishop. The Bishop tried to move the image to Manresa, but it refused to move further than this crag; so they built here a chapel to receive it, and we worship it here to-day. This is our Heaven-sent Cathedral of the Moutains.’ ” The followmg is a description of the approach to the holy mountain by the same writer, and we see in it every characteristic of a Sivaik shrine:— “As vain would it be to attempt to describe or paint in words the passes of the Alps or the Tyrol as the ascent to the summit of the crags of Montserrat. A great, grey, serrated, jagged range, twenty- four miles in circumference, its stones worn into smooth boulders by time and storm, or standing up into the clear blue sky on shivered rifts and crags, this range seems to spring out of the earth, and look in frowning defiance over the peaceful vinyards and lonely villages that nestle at its feet. Its summit —it rises sheer out of the earth—is of equal elevation with Madrid, 2400 feet above the sea level, others say 3800 feet. The road to it, runing in steep circles round and round the mountain side, seems dangerous enough; it is, however, broad enough for two carriages to pass, although without protection on the side. It was made at the desire and for the convenience of Queen Isabella. The ascent occupies two and a half hours on foot. The view is simply sublime. Grey tables, to all appearance toppling over, but poised as perfectly as the Logan Stone of Cornish fame, and boulders of rock overhang the traveller’s head, looking as if about to fall each moment; the valleys are strewn with masses of grey "},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 314rock and many-tinted stone. Nor is vegetation lacking to complete the beauty and lend an additional charm to the grandeur of this semi-Alpine scene. On every ledge grows the pine, the fig, the peace, and the plane tree; while wild olive, ilex, broom, rosemary, cistus, and a host of Alpine plants twine together over the shattered masses of stone. Many such shrines and sacred hills have I marched scores of miles to see, for in India, these places are generally far from the busy haunts of man and the beats of commerce, and out of the route of the engineer, unless he is in quest of water sources and “gathering grounds”; yet I never missed them, even though they coat a gallop of some forty miles and a night’s rest under the “cool grey crag.” Here is a sketch of such a holy shrine of “the mountain-god,”, which, in 1855, I reached through many long miles of pathless forest and jungle, guided only by compass and his occasionally seen giant Fig. 266.—KAIKYTO, A LOFTY MOUNTAIN SHRINE IN THE KITANO DISTRICT OF BRITISH BARMA. form. It lies in the south-east part of very orthodox Boodhistic Barma, and was then a place which even Boodhists approached with silent awe and reverence, though those now rejoicing in the literature of our English schools have departed from the priestly thraldom of their parents. At the period of my visit, however—the close of the last Barmese war—I could not at first induce my Barmese followers to accompany me, "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 315perhaps from a mixed fear of the place, its pathless wilds, and lest my presence should offend the priests, and they, as guides, be to blame. So after sundry failures I rode off alone, leaving two Indian servants to follow as best they could. I spent a night and a day on the summit, and found it in all respects a characteristic Sivaik sight. The shrine crowns the last and nearly highest southerly spur of a most extensive mountain-range, which, branching off from the mountains of Tibet, pursues a southerly course, dividing in its way the kingdoms of Asam and Barma. At Kaiktyo it falls headlong in bold and grand masses, covered with luxurious vegetation (now perhaps, wanting) into a rich delta land of many streams, among which the Sitang is here the moot important. The view from the shrine is grand in the extreme. North and east, forest and bamboo-clad. mountains everywhere bar the way, whilst to the west the rich plains of Pegu (British Barma) stretch far and beyond the eye’s ken, and to the south the range is seen dipping into the centre of one of the grandest bays of Asia, threaded by many fine streams—all most dangerous to the mariner, but perhaps on that account, more than ever sacred to the saint. It is exactly such a spot as pious men, and especially nature-worshippers, would love to dwell near in dreamy idleness; and here in consequence, these have ever congregated and no doubt did so more espe-cially in pre-Boodhist days, when every strange, weird-looking stone would be a symbol or emanation of Mahā-Deva, and if a “rocking one,” the veritable and “Speaking-” God himself, who could thus acquiesce or be silent as priestly device manipulated him. Such craft and even winking figures, were not peculiar to Egypt or Christian Europe. The m0st sacred “rocking stone” of Kaiktyo—it does not rock now and probably never did so—is that grand pivot one on which a temple some forty feet high is built and which over hangs the last great vertical cliff of the mountain, looking “ As if an infant touch would urge Its headlong passage down the verge,” —in this case a vertical drop of perhaps a thousand feet. Sacred clefts and holes abound here, and my followers, who eventually all joined me, pushed themselves through several, but believers and unbelievers alike soon busied themselves—more profitably as they thought, certainly more sacreligiously—with long bamboos having wax at the ends, trying to fish up the pious gifts of gold and silver in coins and trinkets, which pilgrims had for ages been dropping down the sacred chasms, especially that seen under the great end-pagoda-crowned rock. The devious windings and enormous depths, however, baffled all their endeavours, though success, I was told, often attended such impious efforts. The peculiar sanctity of the prominent pagoda rock, is I think the faint yoni-like form on its face, situated as this is, over the sacred abyss and under another fissure. These features would at once commend the spot to the Sivaik heart as a suitable place for the conical God. Another small granite cup-like rock is seen behind the large Pagoda; its Arkite form naturally "},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 316 Fig .267.—Sol in the fold of winter.

The range of which Kaiktyo is the Southern apex was said, of old, to abound with gold and certain precious stones, and I afterwards saw gold washers earning a few annas a-day—4d. to 15d.—in the northern parts, near to Shooe-gyenor Soorāja-Boomi (the “golden district”), otherwise known to the outside world as the Aurea Chersonese, regarding which the reader should consult my Map, Plate II., at beginning of this Volume, and carefully consider its nomenclature. With reference to what has been said of Lilith, Eve, and the Talmudic and classic tales of strange hydras, I would ask all students to ponder over the wonderful myths pourtrayed in Plates XIII. and XV. Under Fig. 6 of the latter I subscribe “Vishnoo treading on the serpent, unites man and woman.” This is a true Pytho-Solar idea of the fertilizing Equinox, for here Vishnoo or the Sun—enfolded in Passion’s embrace, tramples and excites, or as elsewhere said, bruises the serpent’s head, which is fondly and excitingly snpported by a loving Adam and Eve, the former of whom the serpent kisses or stings. The couple are ocean-born ones, rising out of strange Dolphin1-like mouths that euphemism for the womb, and in keeping with western legend which makes Aphrodite, the ocean’s foam. We have the other idea—the Areal Serpent and not Passion—in Figs. 1 and 2, where the phallic-capped Apollo—Krishna, No. 1—is mourning under the bite of Kaliya the wintry Sign, whilst in No. 2. he is rejoicing that he has flung it off, and is there crowned with a solar diadem of fruits and flowers.2 I give here somewhat the same, as com-monly met with in the modern as well as ancient temples of India. Though not very artistic, these figures are full and clear in ideas—what we here more particularly re-quire. All my illustrations are given only to impart and fix definitely and accurately in the reader’s mind the pervading ideas of the old worshippers, no matter how rudely or inartistically they have been handed down to us. Bacon spoke much to the point when he urged that “Truth comes more easily out of error than out of confusion...wrong but clear-thinking being next best to right-thinking.” Observe in this very interesting Plate XIII.—brim full of many a forgotten old solo-phallic and ophite idea—the holy burning mountains and caves, or sacred weems (VI.), the reptile—Passion—receiving phalli (II.), and gazing at the 1 Cf.

See how the phallic heart—the mysterious f of a later race, or symbolic fig leaf, which decks all serpent Arks and phalli—dangles from his neck, whilst his head1 supports the Sun and Serpent; pro-minently before him stands the budding tree or rod, as the Hebrew called this Arkite treasure. Notice also the closely bound “Symbola Hori” with a rod, carrying cross and circle, a strange tube, and a Delta at neck,2 whilst on the opposite side stands ex-panded night as Camion (Kam-i-On) carrying a crescent on a cone—that Sivaik idea repeated below in its Egyptian form of the Osirian acorn supporting Luna (Fig. XIII.). The Great Creator Am-On-Ra is seen forming the first emblem or instrument of crea-tion in Fig. XI., and in the beautiful ideagraph XII., woman, the Spes Divina stands replete with fruit and flowers, between. her Pillar God and fruiting ark—that womb of Life with “its one small door.” From both spring forth corn and pomegranites, and as she leans securely on great Jove, the whole universe of Man and Matter is said to revolve about them. Bearing in mind these ideas, we shall more easily see from what a very ancient fount Keltik faiths and myths sprang—the same probably as gave birth or substance to Egyptian, Turanian, and Eastern Aryan mythology. KELTS.—As scholars are aware, Ketæ is a Greek term, first applied by Hero-dotus, to one of the most western of all peoples except the Kynetæ or Kunets—evi-dently a Greek corruption for Koots or Kooths. These Kunetæ are said to have occu-pied Ireland and all the most western parts of England and Gaul, whilst the Galli—the Latin name for Kelts—occupied eastem Ireland, Scotland, England, and Central Europe. The actual name Kelt is thought to have been applied to this people by the Iberians,3 for all Iberians were not Kelts, and the Iberians whom Greeks and Romans had met in Spain and in lands bordering the highlands of the Kaukasis, spoke of Keltæ as only adjoining to and intimate with them. There were also tribes of Kauki (Cauci) in Ireland and Gaul.4 The Kelts of Scotland and Ireland still call all English-speaking Scots, Danes and Skadinavians, Gauls, whilst Englishmen, that is Anglo-Saxons, are known to Gaels as Sasun-nach. Thus the Hebrides having been conquered and long held by Norwegians, are still known in Gaelik as Innse-Gaul or Isle of Gauls,5 just as Armorikans or Bretons persist in calling the French, Gauls. I shall now proceed to state some facts in relation to the ancient British Kelts, and certain conclusions which the Rev. Mr. Davies came to thereon in regard to the faiths thesse exhibit, in his very valuable, but still little known volume—“The Mythology 1 Cf. Vol. I., 295-297, and figs. 34, 53, and 264. 2 Symbol of Muliebre pudendum, see I., 238, and Dunbar’s Greek Dic. 3 Eastern Origin of Keltic Nations, by J. C.

"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 318and Rites of the British Druids.”1 The author was a very pious and orthodox clergy-man of Glamorganshire, and in 1809 dedicated this book to his Bishop. He had not a full or very true conception or correct key to the faiths he sets before us, and ties his arguments into wondrous knots, owing to the ever present idea in his mind that these Britons were not like all other ancient peoples, mere phallo-Arkites, but had in some mysterious way heard of the Jewish Noah and his Ark, as that tale is crystallized in Christianity. The clergyman’s volume is all the more valuable to us on this account if we can but untie the knots, and this, I hope, those who have advanced thus far with me, can in the presence of the facts related in these volumes, do for themselves. Mr. Davies sums up his conclusions upon his largest volume with a sentence which there is no gainsaying, and which renders all remarks of mine in refutation of his Biblical Noah and Ark unnecessary. He says: “From this analysis (a volume of 642 pages), it appears that the religion of the Britons differed from that of most heathen nations, only as a variety in the same species, that it presented no funda-mental principle which can be accounted peculiar. Its two main branches--the Archite and the Sabian—have been clearly traced, and in the same connection, over great part of the ancient world.”2 There is none of the flippant ignorance here which some modern nomenclature betrays. The author has gauged, if not very fully grasped the height, the breadth and the depth of his subject, and therefore does not presume to call a wondrous old faith, its rites and symbols, mere “Folk-lore;” perhaps he even foresaw that a generation might follow who would superciliously apply this term to all that he held dear. Let us now proceed to examine the rich appendices of this Rev. antiquary’s work which contain much of the original Bardik matter on which the book is built. It gives to those who can read Welsh and Gaelic, the key to several important ancient writings of from the 4th to the 6th C.A.C., if not very much earlier, but I must rest content with the author’s notes and translations. Cesar, we may remember, states that the Druids, paid the greatest honours to Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva, and valued these gods in this order.3 Dio-nysius records that the rites of Bacchus were duly celebrated in the British Isles4 and Strabo, citing Artemidorus, mentions that “in an island close to Britain, Ceres and Proserpine are venerated with rites similar to the orgies of Samothrace.”5 Pliny calls the Druids the Magi of the Gauls and Britons; and Tacitus relates that the German Estyi worshipped the mother of the gods under the form of a boar8—the Arkite idea; whilst Faber narrates that Noah was worshipped in conjunction with the sun, and the ark with the moon9—either standing for the other. In the old Keltic poem of Teyrn On, the Helio Arkite God, we observe many words very similar to the Hebrew, as Adonai,10 Lord, Al-Adur—rdala—glorious God, 1 Mr. Davies published two vols., Celtic Researches, Traditions and Languages, 1804; British Druids, Myth. and Rites, 1809. 2 Brit.

"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 319Arion or Aren the Arkite, &c. Angar was the fountain of heat or Apollo, and the mother was Ladon or Latona. In an ancient song, a priest speaking as the god, says “I am a tower or pyramid, an architect and a prophet; I am a serpent and I am love; the cell1 the ROCK of the Supreme Proprietor, the chief place of tranquility, and the opening chasm; I am the Bull Becr Llèd,2 the repository of mystery, the place of re-animation; I love the tops of trees with the points well connected. . . . . We were put forth, decomposed and simplified, by the tops of the birch. The tops of the oak connected us together.3 . . . To my knife a multitude of thighs (?) have submitted. . . . Let the “thigh” be pierced in blood. . . . The man has not been born who can compare with me in the gap(?), except it be Goronwy—the supreme lord of the water —the deified patriarch. . . . When Aeddon (the Helio-Arkite God) came from the land of Gwydion (Hermes who conducts all to the Abyss) into Sëon of the strong door (the nine sacred damsels), a pure poison diffused itself for four successive nights . . . I have been the stock of a tree; a pin in forceps (my Fig. 30, p. 84, Vol. I.); a cock upon hens in Eiden; a stallion on a mare; I have been Aedd, the Helio-Arkite God.”4 In the very old and remarkable poem of TALI-ESIN, called Preid den Annwn, which some translate “Spoils of the Deep,” we seem to have a mythological deluge5 in which the Druids acknowledge none but Arkites. They call Caer Sidi the Ark, “the sanctuary of Ceres,” that is the Yoni, “the circle of the Zodiac, or what produces life; and we are told that Pryd Wen means not only the “shield of the mythic Arthur,” but also his ship and an ark, because Prud is “beauty,” and Wen “a female;”6 and the “Arthur is the representative of Noah,” that is Saturn on the Sun7 —the mast in the Argha. The symbolic shield was the special badge of the chief Druid. The Solar God said Druids, moves in the morning, but the procession of Ceres with her ark, yoked by kine or fertile life, in the evening;8 her sacred Magi, worship the sun as fire.9 All this of course our author misreads and comments upon accordingly; but he is historical when he comes to HU and “the honey island of Beli” or Britain, for Hu, he says, was the huge serpent god, the lord of Britain; the great bud, Vod, or Wod, was the dragon chief and protector of the Kymri, and of the seasons, “the glancing, gliding king who pursues the fair one,” as “Jupiter in the form of a serpent,” pursued and violated Proserpine, producing Bacchus. For this Solar Python, “the fabricator of Kyd or the Ark” did the Gwylion or Sëon weep, says our reverend and perplexed author, as the Jewish women wept for Tamuz.10 In their troubles these “old Brithi,” of Druidic times said, “we will wait upon 1 Brit.

Britain possesses coins of considerable antiquity, bearing marks of priority to Roman rule, and belonging to a time “when they (the Britons) had independence and religious and political establisments.”3 They were stamped with sun and moon, Apollo with his harp, and Beli and Tydain,4 the British Janus, and Saidi; also with mysterious looking masks reminding us of a phallic God, and the conical hats of most priests.5 On the British coins, or pieces of gold and silver—possibly talismans—were figures which remind us of the strange objects we still see in India under sacred trees (vide Vol. I., p. 31, Fig. I., of the Mamojee, page 72), “the horse with the back and head of a bird, a body bent forward like a boat, and little groups of balls and leaves for legs, . . . wheels, balls, and crescents”;6 a poet describes one of the animals as “a proud mare, like a ship upon the waters,” the crude idea of Phebos and Phebi. Ova are occasionally shown as falling from the animals, and ova and glain balls are, as has been already pointed out, special and much valued symbols with Druid priests. The tradition from ancient Druid story, in regard to the flood, is that “the lake of Llion (Euxine?) burst and overwhelmed all save Dwyan (Deva of the Sanskrit), and Dwyvack,” that is N and K, or An and Ak (moon and sun?) man and woman, and that they arrived in “a naked vessel” in Britain and peopled it.7 The Kymri had also a tradition that they came unde rHu, from Defrobani (Ceylon?), in the land of Hav, which is thought to be near Constantinople. Some think this is S’Ham or S’amos, which was the headquarters of the race before the eruption of the sea.8 We have also “the testimony of Artemidorus that Britons celebrated the mysteries of Ceres and Proserpine in one of the British Isles, with the same rites as in Samothrace.” Long before Christianity broke in upon their world, Kelts and Kymri had, for spiritual guidance, abundance of religious and moral maxims, of which the following are a few specimens:—9 1 Davies, p. 564-5.

Thus then we may dismiss from our minds all childish ideas about “Folk-lore,” King Arthur, his round table and knights, and see instead, the most ancient gods and faith of Kaldian or proto-Kaldian times. We must try to comprehend a great Fertilizer, Uthyr, and his Kadair, Chair or Ceres, with divers other emblems of this faith, and then we shall see what these rude men meant. Huan, Hu, Heea, or Hea, “the mighty creator,” was called by Kelts Teithan, in Ireland Titan, a form of the Sun-god, repre-sented by the bull—fit sign for Titans—and therefore sometimes denominated “the roaring Beli,” and sometimes Bûdd,1 “the king who rises in light,” an exact counter-part of the Eastern Boodha. As Angor, “the producer of good,” Hu is also “the serpent who pierces the sullen” or dull ones, or darkness—the female principle; he was thus “the quickener” of body and mind; and as Angor is Mad-iem, Bonus Janus, Seethenin, or phallic Saturn, so back again we come to the Sun. The island of Mona was the favourite seat of the serpent-god Hu, where he was also called Aed-don, and as such said to have come from the land of Hermes.2 He was called Father Deon, “the ruler of the sea,” the Lord of Arka, and “constructor of Kyd, that ark . . . . stored with corn, and borne aloft by serpents;” and we see from the following remarkable passage that he was god of the Druid circle, which was “the stall of the cow,” mean-ing as is here and elsewhere clear, the yoni or “door of life.” The Rev. Mr. Davies, who is innocent of all such ideas, writes: “Hence the symbolic ‘Ape,’ ‘the stall of the cow,’ and the mundane rampart or circular temple, are consecrated to the Diluviān god and his vessel, and the season of their festive dance is proclaimed by the cuckoo.”3 Now the corn ark is Ceres and Salacia—the waters of passion, and the month 1 Davies, p. 116.

Rector of Glamorganshire. Hue was called by Kelts the glancing, gliding sovereign of heaven, “the god of battles,” and he was always attended by a yoni-spotted cow, the “giver of blessings (reminding us of Indra) and this cow the Druids sacrificed on May Eve, when they said “there was egress from the ark,” for that month is the opening of summer, and is also called “the month of bastards.”1 As the god Aedd, Hu “died and lived alter-nately,” like all other solar gods, and his priests carried ivy branches, as did those of Bacchus, he was `U-aj or `U-hj—Sar-apis or Sar-ophis. Thus Mr. Davies and Cesar were right in saying that “the opinions of the Druids in respect to the nature and attributes of the gods corresponded in the main with that of other nations.”2 It is held by Plutarch, Bryant, Faber, Davies, Holwell, and many learned and orthodox writers, that Typhon is the sea that compelled Osiris the husbandman, to enter the ark,3 and this of course about the great September fêtes, from which May is the ninth month, and therefore that of egress. In Wales, the great feat of Hu, or rather his oxen, was their having drawn his Avanc—apparently a huge thing or creature, “like a beaver,” out of a deep abyss of water. The cattle were bulls of the finest breed, called Ychen Banawg, which last word means “prominent,” or conspicuous,4 “so that the whole story seems a crude rustic one regarding the fertilization of the country by this great earth-bull;” for this deity is proclaimed by his priest as saying, “I am the bull, Bekr-Lled, or he of flame, the cell, and the opening chasm . . . and the world has no existence were it not for my progeny.”5 The cattle—Ychain Banawg, are elsewhere said to be the property to Hu, and to have been three, so I suspect we have in this favourite old Welsh myth, merely a coarse tale concerning the phallik Triad,6 in which case the Avanc becomes the Ark or Ceres, as the reverend writer thinks it is. Pliny speaks of the round lake of Van-dimon (An-demon?), sacred to the Latin Janus,7 who Mr Davies says is none other than the Noah of Scripture, who he thinks was known at the same time in Italy and Britain. This lake had sacred floating islands—a significant and common arkite symbolism; thus Horus is fabled as escaping from Typon on a floating island or ark, and Delos—the womb—was such another from which Apollo floated into life.8 There was a Sena or sacred island dedicated to the sun as Hue, in the British seas, on which lived nine virgins who were 1 Davies, p. 119-121, and see May fêtes, p. 451, Vol. I., under Sun Worship, and Indra under index. 2 Ibid., p. 122. 3 Ibid., p. 125, 126, quoting all authorities. 4 Ibid., p. 128-130. 5 Davies, p. 137. 6 Ibid., p. 141. 7 Ibid., p. 159, and Pliny, VIII. 20.

They are figuratively and quaintly said to have unroofed their temple annually, and by a united effort to have completed the roof again between sunrise and sunset; if one of them dropped or lost “a burden” (infant?) which Strabo says always happened, she was torn limb from limb by the others, and carried round the temple with shouts and solemnities, until their fury was abated.1 Of course this was an annual sacrifice to Bacchus, and the uncover-ing was symbolic of the annual fertilization of “the cell” by the Sun. Strabo’s priestesses annually covered “the cell” or “stall of the cow” with “branches,” and the Keltic bards say they sometimes made a “calamitous slip”!2 The Tauriform god whom they served was a rock surrounded with billows, “. . . . the chief place of tranquility, . . . . where the goddess Nêr calmly dwelt.”3 The strange tales of these old bards recall to us scenes and symbolic articles, or figures, common alike in Jewish and Indian temple-rites. Thus dancings and ceremonies round a cauldron or “great sea,” like this of Solomon’s, is but a feature of Arkite or womb worship, which the East has abundantly exhibited, and Kêd, Ceridwen, or Ceres is here called the proprietor of the British sea or caul-dron.4 So the Jewish “cow-cart,” which drew their ark, corresponds to the Phenician cart of Argruerus (who is Noah, says Faber), and which was drawn by cows; we learn also both from Tacitus and the Rev. Mr. Davies5 that the same idea obtained in Germany. The antiquary here states the following as his conclusion, after much pains-taking research, and I quite agree with him, viz., that “the worship of the Sun was an adventitious branch grafted at some remote period into the religion of our ancestors,” that is long after this Tree, Arkite, Phallik, and serpent worship. The man of the ark or the cauldron is a thoroughly well-known “GREAT GOD, acknowledged by all the an-cient bards or Druids of Britain,” which is but an English way of saying that the great Keltik god was the Argha-Nàt. The island of Mona was his special seat, where he was “Hu, the mystic ruler . . . . the Diluvian god who had no superior . . . . the severe renumerator.” All this was the induibitable teaching of the sixth century A.C.,6 which Christianity then attacked, an in about seven hndred years overthrew. The Ceres, Geres, or earth-ark, was often styled Niobe, Archis, Selene7 or Tselene, Kêd, Ceridwen, and the goddess of corn, and therefore the wife of Pal, Fal, Bal, or Bar, &c., god of corn, “the erector or builder up” of the human race. But the Druidik Pal was Arthur, or which in these matters is the same, the “father of Arthur,” called in Keltik UTHYR BEN-DRAGON, “the Lord of Ceridwen,” “the wonderful,” the leader, and 1 B.

Uthur had three wives, all called Gwen-wy-var, or “Lady of the summit of the water” (chief or essence of water),3 which is probably the ancient name Kwem, Kuin or Kun-war, a feminine term corresponding to Es-war, the holder of the Esh, as woman is of the Kun or “Abyss;” for the Druids said that Arthur presided over “the deep,”4 and was “the oak, the Quickener,” “the guardian of the Door,” (Wen or Woman) the Dwarka-Nāt, Gate-God or holder of the key and of “the prison of Gwair”—the enclosure of Side, that is the Caer-sidi, from which came forth seven persons. Caer is here evidently the sun, whom brings forth the weekly seven, whilst Sidi is the Meso-potamian Solo-phallik name for the shrine of Bet-Sidi at Ashur or Esh-war; “Seithin Saidi,” said these old writers, “is Saturn or Janus, the guardian of the door of the ark.”5 Gwair is held by antiquarians to be Noah, and his prison is an ark, Kwed, Caer Gohur or “dark abode,” and the Oeth-ag-Anoeth—“wrath and remission of wrath,”' or place of “Passion and Fire.”6 The early Keltik bards were as inveterate as Asiatic writers in all figures of speech like this; not only was “the female cell” or Caeridwen, “the Abyss” of their Creating gather-god, but it was also called Caer-Ochren, “the sacred cell,” Caer-Bedwyd, “the Adytum from which all life comes, Car-Vandwy, “the cave by or on the hill”—the Mons Veneris—and “the island of the strong door,” where stood Seon and Gwyllion, Shevoon and Gool, the watchful ones. The world is greatly indebted to Mr. Davies, though a strenuous advocate of Christianity, for the very faithful acoounts he has handed down to us of these sol-phallik tales; of course he often rejoices in supposed proofs, or in matter confirmatory of the Bible tales of Noah, his ark and the flood, yet we can here and there notice that he is also often lost in wonder and doubt as to how Druids arrived at such copious and accurate knowledge of Jewish Bible stories, and so long before any Chris- tians set foot on our islands. In these days, however, none need wonder at this, seeing that Babylonian records of about 3000 B.C. have similar tales, and may thus be the source both of Keltik and Jewish mythology, at all events of the latter. Never-theless as the affections which prompted the worship of an Asher, Uthur or Arthur, a Noah, Nimrod, or “generative power” with a Ceres, ked or ark, &c., are common to all mankind, it is possible, though not probable, that the stories arose spontaneously; seeing however that the first depository of records was on the Euphrates,7 many reasonably affirm tha the stories arose from the fertile fancies of these most ancient wor- 1 Davies, p. 187. 2 Owen’s Cambrion Biog., p. 473 et seq., V.

Inasmuch, however, as our frames and primal emotions are the same everywhere, we need not assume that any one race had wholly worked out the strange developments of this universal and persistent faith. The same feelings which led Da-Naus (Ark-God) and his followers to say their Ark of Life first rested at Apo-bathmos in Argolis or Arkolis, and who religiously carried a sacred model of this Yoni symbol called the Amphi-prumnon. (Omphi of Fire?), and lodged it in the Akropolis of Argos,1 their Ark-os, which they then justly called Laris, also taught Britons to adopt these phallik symbols. Little teaching was required; the same animal natures would in ordinary circumstances mature or at least evolve to some extent the same ideas, and then the same symbolism, rites and faiths; these would only be all perfectly similar, when the circumstances and surroundings were so. There is no doubt as to the translation and pre-Christian character of the writings from which all this matter is gathered; and that it has not before attracted sufficient attention is only another proof that until the minds of a people are gradually educated up to their subject, the most crushing evidence and logic fall without effect. Even writers do not always see the strength and scope of what they gather together, and in this case, neither the Lord Bishop of Landaff, to whom these volumes on Druidism were dedicated, nor his rector, the author, fully grasped, if at all, the faith involved by Uther, Ked, “the abyss” or “cell of the cow” and the other startling phraseology here laid before us. How few indeed around us even yet do so? These Britons called their Patri-Arch, Beu-no—“Bull of the Ship,” venerating him under the figure of this animal,2 but, add Bryant and Davies, Saturn and Janus are the characters he more especially denotes. He has usually a staff in his hand like Moses, and points to a “Rock” (the male symbol) from which comes a stream of water; he holds a key in the other hand, and is called Thurāios, the Deity of the door or passage, or rather he is “the oblong stone which stops a cavern door”!3 One would have thought that this plainly enough shows that no Mosaik Noah is here. This Saturn is Tegid, the husband of Aren or Arene, the “ark or citadel” or “city of the ark,” in which case Aren is Ar-wen or “the female Ar.” Tegid is Fleidwr Flam, “the encloser of falme,” and “the son of Godo, the Arkite cell,” but confus-edly called also Seith-wed Saidi, the doorkeeper of Godo,4 and a form of Janus. Tegid signified like Boodh, “Serenity,” but seems also a general name like Pan–theos; he was the father of Creirwy, “token of the egg,” or Proserpine, and was Sad or Saidi, “the firm one of the vessel,” and hence called Sad-wrn or Said-on, a name of Dagon, and apparently the Keltik pronunciation of Saturn.5 Truly and fairly writes this clergyman, all these stories “are various avenues pointing to the prominent 1 Pausanias V., ii., 329; Bryant and Davies, p. 192.—The ark of Deu-Kalion or Deva-kala rested on Mount Parnassus, where Apollo’s temple was. 2 From Bu and ox, and Nau, Naus or Nou, a ship.

The enclosure of Saturn was a Gan-eden—the “cell of the cow,” or the “circle of the faith;” the Klachan, Al-teine, Hilton, Magh Sleacht or “field of adoration,” &c.; but this CHAIR or Cadair2 was also an euphemism like “the foot,” for the God-oracle, as the head of the court of Uthyr, the Sun or Hu, is called. We speak to this effect when we allude to the “President of a meeting,” and all this shows us how easily the Eduth or Testimony became the ark, and the ark became Jahveh. So the simpe word Caer, an “enclosure,” became not only the “sanctuary,” but the chair and the God, for Saidi, the British Saturn, Chronos, or Crodon, and Sidi his spouse, were commonly known as Cy-wryd, Crydon, and Caer-Sidi, the sanctuary or cell of Ceres,3 though here again there is a confusing of the god and goddess, perhaps, as Mr. Davies suspects, owing to the names having “nearly the same sound,” as in the case of Siva and Sivi; it is clear that “the chair” of Uthyr, Said, Hu or Tegid (all the same god), meant the Sakti or “energy” of the god, and that the God himself was identified with his ark. Kelts like others looked upon the Raven (Morvran), as a. bird of ill omen, and his croaking “put a stop to the process of matrimony,”4 and naturally so, as he pro-minently appeared near the abodes of man during the seasons of sterility. The Raven disappointed Noah as well as Apollo, but after the allegorical deluge “he became the pride of Cerid-wen,” and in this form was called Avagdu, the son of Tegid, that is Apollo, for darkness was then changed into light, and his name became El-phin or El-pi, “the holder of the Bow” or Iris, Eros, Phanes, and the true Helio-Arkite Hermes or P’ompe; as such he was said to occupy the “Chair,” “Cerid” or Cerid-wen,5 and was a mere youth, representing, thinks Davies, “the uninitiated”! As Avagdu was the son of Tegid the Sun, so Creirwy, “the egg-token,” was called the daughter of Cerid-wen, “the genius of the Ark,” and the Greek Proserpine, —the seed or “egg” vessel; and hence say our authors, “the parentage of the British Venus seems to correspond with that of the Greeks.”6 It was “Creivy” who presented to mankind the “Wand, Rod, or Branch,”7 the name given to “the son of Jesse (Ishai), the Saviour of mankind.” The chief Druid as the custodian of the Ovum anguinam, signified that he was the older of the egg of fertility, and priests have ever maintained that procreation must not take place without their sanction. 1 Davies, p. 200.

Mr. Davies is quite correct in telling us1 that “the British Venus cor-responded with that of the Greek,” indeed with even the worst features of the libidinous goddess, as in this Aphrodite, whom Greeks and Romans thus depicted with somewhat barefaced effrontery, for she is here seeking coition with that which cupid’s torch inflames. It is neces-sary to study such pictures, obscene though they be, if we would thoroughly understand these old faiths, and see through the maudlin poetry and sentimen-talism which veiling real facts, would give us false notions of the roots of old religions. This figure —one commonly fonnd in standard classical dic-tionaries—is copied from a gem in the Museum Ro-manorum, Causei (I., 40), and reveals the true idealism involved in the worship of Asher and Ashera or “Grove” of Shemites, of the Ashtōreth or Aistéo-reacht—“moon goddess of lewdness” or Irish Kelts,2 of the mother of Phenicia whether in Asia Minor, Carthage or Britain, and of “the beloved of the Adonis of Byblos.” Many an old faith-idea is hid in the Fire, Love and Desire here depicted, and here too lies the secret of many a Gan-Eden allegory of Adams and Eves, Apples and Serpents. The Kelts termed woman, Annyn, “the Abyss,” the “abode of fire,” Hades, Paradise, and Hell; and their Keltik Pluto—“King of Gwyn,” they called “the genius of the Flood.” They described him as in the classic story, carrying off Annyn or Gwyn, to hide the seed, in Mother Terra, and thus for a time symbolizing winder and desolution and sterility. Phrygians show him stabbing Mithras, yet he is recreating. Druids had an initiatory rite of baptism by “holy water;” they immersed or sprinkled from the “Holy sea” or “Cauldron” in which was ever kept a divine liquid concocted of sea water seasoned by salt, barley, laurel, and many similar phallik nos-trums, all mixed with skill, and and after divers occult witchcraft proceedings, regarding which see Glossary under Siva, as Sar Sarva, “the salt one,” Sarasvati, Vara, &c. The neophyte had often to be passed through the fire3 before immersion, so that, as I said in my prologue on the Sun (Vol. I., p. 407), our rites are now mild indeed to those which Mithraik faiths required. This Cauldron of Cerid-wen and its mystic water was in a figurative sense “the mysteries of Ceres.”4 that is of creation and immortality. My readers will remember what I have already said regarding the efficacy of the holy water which escapes from 1 I agree with Vallency that Venus is derived from Bean, Van, or Vean, the Keltik for “woman,” but is this all?

After partaking of holy water and being fully initiated, Druids required many things from the aspirant to the fruits of Ceres, and so did Greeks; Clemens Alexan-drinus enjoins the young Greek to address his priest thus:— “ I have eaten out of the drum. I have drunk out of the cymbal. I have carried the kernos. I have been covered in the bed.”1 This Kernos was no doubt the Censor (Kensor, by metathesis Kernos) or vessel which, filled with the offerings or sacred fire, preceded all processions as we still observe this custom in the East, nay, the West too, for do not the neophytes and acolytes of our churches usually precede and carry the fire and other sacred paraphernalia of the rites? so with Jews and Egyptians we see the Kernos with sacred fire heading the proces-sion, as in Fig. 73, p. 191, of the previous volume. Damsels as maidenly “graces,” “Music,” &c., and generally three to nine in number, had their places in all such rites, alike in the faiths of Northern and Southern Europe and of Egypt.2 Thus the mystic Druid vase or cauldron was of no use unless warmed by the breath of nine Arkite damsels, comforters of the Patriarch of the so-called “Deluge.” Similar priestesses of Ceres—“Melissæ or honey-bees,” are fabled to have led Athenians into the land of the Yoni-ans or IOnians, a story said to have been borrowed from Egypt, whose Osirian deity —“the avowed representative of the Diluvian patriarch”3 had nine similar damsels. All nations have quaint lore regarding the “Water of Immortality.” Our earliest Indian aborigines, the Soors, think much of Amreeta—their vital Nectar, and say it alone reanimates all nature, and “is a milk-like stream concocted of various juices.” Out of it arose the great Deo, “Dan Wantaree, who churned the ocean into foam . . . . out of which came new life to his expiring species.”4 The Druid story of the re-creation of life makes Cerid-wen frantically pursue Gwion, who flees before her transforming himself successively into a hare, a fish, a bird, and finally into a grain of wheat the lady taking the form of a greyhound, otter, hawk, and finally a hen, and at last devouring him in this Bet-lechem, where she conceived by him a lovely child which she covered with a skin, and deposited in a small boat or “coracle,” and placed on “the sea on the 29th April.” On the next day or 1st of May, all men celebrate the birth of the new born May, for this, says Mr. Davies, is “the day of the deliverance from the ark.”5 The conception would in this case be about midsummer. Dogs play as conspicuous part in faiths as do hens and cocks, Ceres has always a dog in the Elusinian cave, and a dog ushers in her devotees; dogs assist Isis to find Anubis, the child of Osiris, one of whose forms is that of a dog. Even priests are called kunes or dogs, which Kaldians, Phenicians, and Hebrews make kahen or koen. The otter, which 1 Brit.

Notice that the final form of the creating Cerid-wen is said to be the hen which is also the favourite form of Isis as in Pl. XIII., IX., where she so appears “brooding,” as it were, over the symbol of generative nature—the bull Apis. She is commonly a woman with a hen’s head or a cap representing the prolific egg-giver. Mr. Davies writes that “the district of Snowdon, from the remotest period of British mythology, was famous for its Arkite memorials. Here was the city of Emrys or “the Ambrosial,” also called Pharäon . . . the Baalim of the Arkite Patriarchs, and here the Dragons were concealed” who drew the car of Kêd or Ceres. Emrys was the great Helio-Arkite after whom Stonehenge and the city of Snowdon were named.1 The country was called after Gwydnaw, who was evidently also Gwydion, the son of Don, the same as Mercury the son of Jove or Hermes, and identical with Tegid,2 as Patriarch or Progenitor; the derivation being, thinks Davies and others, from Gwyd, Priest, and naw, a boat; hence “the Priest of the Ship” or the Argha-nât. His son Elphin or Apollo, “who bore the ears of corn,” was said to be eonfined in “a strong stone tower,”3 that is, was represented by a Bet-El or Lingam. The old Bards are found to be ever lauding “the liberation of El-Phi-in”—“the fertile principle,” and this is called “delivering an oracle.” The Keltik word translated ark, signifies a sacred ship, sanctuary, temple or womb,4 and often also, Hippa, “the mare,” a name of Ceres, “the swelling one out of the dark cave,” as in this Fig. 271. Her boat was Menes, Meen, Menon, or Dea Luna,5 and most of the names of races, as the Menæi of Sicily, Minyæ of Elis, and chief of the Argonauts, are thought to be derived from this source, just as Ionians from IO, Ioni or I o h—and old Keltik term. Vallencey says the latter signifies, “the fruit of beast, plant or tree,” and when conjoined with “p Athair, i.e., priomh Athair (Phenician), the first or chief father,” named Iohpater or Jupiter. His Etruskan name was IUP’TER, i.e., “Iu-primus atar contracted to P.ater, from whence the Greek, Pater; Latin, Pater; Bisc., Aita; Gothic Atta; Thessal. atta; Persic, Padder, &c.”6 this learned author here also says that Saturn—in Irish Sath-aran—probably comes from Sat, in Irish “abundance” and Aran, “bread;” and the Earth-god TELLUS of Carthage, from the Keltik Tellur Tella, i.e., Terra-Varuna. URANUS as ruler over land and water is expressed, he thinks, in Uir and An, the Irish for “land” and “water,” but names come usually from gods, and were UR and ANA. Ceres, Geres or Keres, may be connected with Re the well-known moon goddess of both Asia and far off Polynesia, which Ceres also was, 1 British Druids, pp. 243, 244. 2 Ibid., p. 64.

"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Faiths Exhibited by Western Aborigines. 331and as she was invoked for rain with Ceo, “the clouds,” there is ground for Vallencey’s argument in favour of Ceo-Re as “the watery moon.” So the Sun is called Grynaeus by Virgil and others clearly from the older term Grian or Greine. The Keltik bards made a clear distinction between Don (or Jove), and the “Chair” or “Cauldron”; thus in the poem of Cadair Ceridwen, the lady enumerating female excellencies, says I am “accounted skilful in the court of Don,” and superior to others in “my Chair, my Cauldron, and my Laws,” which sexual pre-eminence was un-doubtedly hers.1 Many strange rites existed among these old people in regard to trees and plants; thus, in cutting the “hedge hyssop” or Selago, which the Welsh called Gras Duw or Gratia Dei, it had to be covered up and taken in the right hand by a Druid clothed in white, the priestly dress in approaching sacred fire or any altar. The same custom was observed in regard to the Uil-ioc, Misseltoe or Pren Puraur or “tree of pure gold”—a name Virgil also recognises in calling this the Aurum fron-dens. Druids named it the Uil-ioc or All-heal, because they said it promoted the increase of species, or prevented sterility,2 but this seems inverting the order of things, for the fruiting misseltoe shews the end of winter and opening of the fruitful season, and hence they made the sign the cause; all the same, the worship of Fertility was clearly the end and aim of this faith and of all its rites and sanctified objects. We shall probably never hear the whole truth in regard to this old religion, for as Mr Davies says, “most of the offensive ceremonies must have been either retrenched or concealed,”3 as the “Roman laws and edicts had for ages (before the Bardik writ-ings), restrained the more cruel and bloody sacrifices,” and at the time of the Bards nothing remained but “symbolic rites.” Then, as at Eleusinia, the torch-bearer per-sonated the Sun; the Herald was Mercury, and he who ministered at the altar was symbolically the Moon,4 and “everything sacred, pure and primitive, was derived from the cauldron (or ark) of Cerid-wen,” just as we are asked to consider was the case in regard to the Jewish Ark and Testimony. Those old Kelts spoke of “the language of the Cadair Saidi,” the ark of Tegid or Mercury precisely as Greeks spoke of the voice of the priestess who sat on the tripod of Delphi, or that which issued from beside the Phallik symbol standing before chasm.5 The Caer Sidi was often called the circle, that is a Klachan of Sidi or Sidin, and when the high priest, as representing the god, was present, he was called the Cadair or chair of Caer Sidi, but this is clearly the usual confusion between the Ark, and “god of the ark.” Sidh (Sidē), says Bryant and Davies, is a name of Ceres6 figured as the `Roia (Rhoia),Rimon, Rhea or Pomegranate.

Bith is Keltik for “Life,” and Uile = All, com-plate, or Sun, or if Ur, then Fire, so that Bith-Ul = Life-fire or Enlivener.1 The Druid or ancient Bards quoted by Mr Davies, called the circular temples Caer, from Cor, C y lch or C u lch, a circle, and hence Cylch Balch Nevwy, signified “the magnificent celestial circle, around which the majestic oaks (symbols of Taronwy, god of thunder) spread their Arms”;2 for, as most antiquaries suspected, sacred groves once surrounded these roofless churches of our forefathers. Mr. Davies very thoroughly identifies the circles with the worship of Llywy or Ceres, and Proserpine, and quotes Maurice as saying that Stonehenge was called anciently Choir Gaur or the great choir3 and adds, it is exactly N.E., like all Mithraik temples and most caves, and though outwardly circular, has an oval or egg-like form in the sanctuary. It was “a cell for sacred fire, and not made for strife, but a sanctuary of pacific Bards and Druids.”4 This reverend author agrees with Jacob Bryant as to the identification of Saturn and Rhea with Dwyvan and Dwyvach, (the Deva and Devi or De-vach of Hindoos), with Osiris and Isis, Hu and Kéd, with Noah and the “genius of the ark,” and with Tegid and Cerid-wen5—also called De-gid, De-god or Ceres the earth goddess. The British Eseye is a feminine form of Titin or Teithan, the wintry sun, the Typhon or Titan and Gwydien or Gwydion the Lingam or Hermes. Thus Higgins and the Rev. Mr Davies, arrived independeutly at the very same couclnsion as to Stone-henge that I did myself long before reading their works. The latter sums up his researches by saying that this “great sanctuary of the dominion is not exclusively dedicated to the sun, moon, Saturn, or any other individual object, . . . but is a kind of Pantheon in which all the Arkite and Sabian divinities are present, Noe and Hue, Elphin and Rheidin.”6 The stone cell or Kibla (as Maurice justly calls it after the Mekan womb symbol) is, says Davies, the “cell of fire,”7 and he thinks, what seems most probable, that the great sontes, especially the inner, “were either the very image of the gods (Sivaik symbols) to whom the temples were dedicated, or they were esteemed peculiarly sacred to them and viewed as emblems of their pre-sence,\"”for our ancestors had not yet learned to carve figures, at least none of very early times have been discovered, and hence “in lieu of them,” says Bryant, “they used conical stones called Baitulia”8 for males, and probably the Delphik door for females, formed by two stones leaning against each other, or two on end and one over, 1 B.

Bryant is wrong I think in saying, that “Ab-adir” was a stulos or stone pillar representing Ops the wife of Saturn,” unless, indeed, it was a very ovate stone, in which case the Stulos (Sanskrit Sthūnā) is that seen in Pl. XVI., 7. The stone which Pausanias1 says stood in front of Delphi, and which was constantly anointed, and had libations of wine and sundry high honours2 paid to it, was most certainly the great god Apollo or Maha Deva; so “near to the temple of the Eleusinian Dāmatu,” we are told, there stood “two vast stones called Petronia, one of which was erect, and the other laid over and inserted into the former. There was a hollow in the upper stone with a lid to it, in which was kept a kind of mask,” so that the whole was a very perfect Linga-in-Yoni, like the pair of vases in the temple of Vesta, p. 227. The stones in the famous Spanish church, given in my Plate XV., and the “Dome of the Rock,” with cave and well, over which Shemites built their holiest mosk,—Fig. 6, Vol. I., p. 181,—symbolize the same idea. Such stones are Kromlechs3—“stones of Testimony or of Covenant,” Geis-lia with Kelts, and Jupiter Federis or Lapis with Latins. Now Babylonian scholars say, this Covenant God was known two thousand to three thousand years before Latin days as Izdubar of Kaldia —the “Lord of Covenants,” who leagued with Hea-bani, “Son of Hea,” the Keltik Hu, to destroy the faith then centred in Ishtar th eMoon or female principle.4 Kelts would have called the Judean shrine over “the Dome of the Rock,” a Crair gorsed or “supreme seat of Hu” the god of all Beth-Els, for Hu is always supposed to sit on the Maen Llog or covering stone of the ark of Uthyr or Arthur. The cave and well were held by most races to be the most perfeet symbol of Woman, the Ark or Womb of nature, and especially so among Kelts, as we see in the case of “the Gowr Monument,” in which is a well, having they siad, “a flux and reflux of the sea . . . an enclosure of Sidi’s,—a well of water sweeter than wine.” It was “a Stone Ark,” covered in by an Arthur or “Uthyr Stone.” Circular stones, especially if with a solar disk,—called Arthur’s round tables,—are also named “the couch or PastÕj of the greyhound bitch,” for this was a name of Sidi or Ceres, because she trans-formed herself into a greyhound bitch (Gwâl y Vilast), when, longing for offspring,5 she chased the male god. Ceres as the beneficent one, was represented by any stone or Maen Ketti, this being then called the Ark and Beneficence. Her Lord Uthyr was three nights in the cell of Oeth or An-Oeth, three nights with the lady of Pendragon, and three nights in the Kūd, or under the flat stone of Echemeint, that is, in Cerid wen, whose symbol is also a flat stone, because “the cell under the flat stone”—the Carchar Had—womb or “prison of mystery.”6 It is difficult to trace these three wives and three nights, but religious histories gives us many similar trios.7 Our author unravels 1 Bryant I., p. 476. 2 Ibid., II. 203. 3 British Druids, p. 392. 4 Smith’s Chald.

Sues means swine, which the priests of the Kabiri were called as men dedicated to the mystic Sow—the Hwch or Ceridwen of Kelts, the ploughed and ever fertile Terra. Her con-gregations also were Moch or swine, and her chief priest was Turch, the salacious Boar (a name for Noah as well as Vishnoo), whose ancestry is traced to “Arcol of the long ahnd” (the Sivo-phallik idea), and the son it was said of one Pyr, Pur, or Fire. Among Kelts Arcol was a “lofty mount” or “mountain god,” such a “most high God” or AL, as Abram and Melchized served (Gen. xiv.). Mr. Davies compares him to Herakles of Tyre, and the Our-Kol, Arkel or Arkles of Egypt. The Phenician name Archles signifies “strong” or “robust” and is equivalent to the Hebrew Ercol, “sinewy,” the Irish Aichill and Greek Achillos—the Phāla, Bala or Bala-Ram of Sanskritists.3 Carthage or Mil-Car-thus is merely the Lord—Mil or Melec of Car or Caer, the sacred enclosure; Cartha or Cathair is still the Irish for “a City.” The second principal deity of Carthage was Jolaus or Iol-aus, and their Lares or house-hold gods were called Cabiri, some think from Calra, a shield, one of the symbols of woman, and Selden says the Lares signified Venus.4 This Iol-aus may be connected with Poseidon’s progeny Aiolos the god of winds, the Maroots or Vayoo of India, as these are constantly mentioned in connection with Indra, the Sky-God, Roodra, and Agni. Bad or Badhb, the North wind of the Kelts, was supposed to be a spirit, and Bad is even now in Persian “not only wind, but also the name of the genius or deity of wind”;5 all pointing to a Keltik, Aithiopik or Phenician language as once prevailing from Wes-tern Asia to all over Northern Africa, and the coasts of Spain, Armorika, Britain, and Ireland. General Vallencey’s learned publications clearly establish this, though his orthodox training prevented his ever doubting the stoires of Genesis and supposed priority of Hebrew, which he calls the base of the Bearle Fene or ancient Irish dialect. Helios and Hercules, like Noah, traversed the sea in a cup-shaped vessel supplied by the great god Okeanos (Oceanus) or Nereus, and these were Fire or Pur gods, and connected with all Solo-fire rites and divinations, just as was the Latin 1 British Druids, p. 407. 2 The myth is only solvable by the discovery of such punning.

The Keltik story of a “Flood” is that “Llion the Ancient One”—“father of Pyr” or Pur, was “the deluge” or Diluvian god within the earth, who “once burst- ing forth overwhelmed the whole world,” that is he let forth the spirit or vivifying principle of fertility, as is related of Siva; for as Sarva, Seva set forth Sara or Var—“living waters” which stirred into activity all the inert forces of the Universe and set up strife in heaven itself, where he then established “his only son,” Karte-keya—Mars or the warring principle, which all heroes and their religions have well sustained. Kelts say that it was Seithenin-Saidi (Saturn, El or Noah), who covered Bro-yr-Hud, or “the land of mystery, and enveloped Llengêl—a veil of concealment,”2 a story very like that of Elohim, “brooding over the deep” or Jahveh shutting up his Ark. The Rev. Mr. Davies, calls the Keltik Sow, Ark, Coll or Cor, “the great agents in the adventitious branch of the Druidical religion.” The mystical Sow is, under Coll, who is continually identified with the “red bony (or hard) giant,” as his Hwch or Sow is with the ship or a coffer. Cor or Kur is, thinks Davies, of foreign, probably Phenician extraction,3 and this has been abundantly shown in the Asiatic and African derivatives of this name. Cor is evidently Caer, the circle or enclosure, so that eventually the “red bony giant” became synonymous with the solar shrine; yet at first it was clearly the Phallos, and what so appropriate as a Lingam emblem for the great Fertilizer? latterly, when the races became ashamed of and veiled the organs, the forgot them in the many rites and phenomena of Sabeanism. So their phallik serpent—the Draig Adon, “Dreigian” or procreator,4 which, says Owen, is the Generative principle, became the Sun, “silent lightnings,” &c., just as “the Testi-mony” became the Ark, that outward symbol by which the God was best known. The emblematic flower of the Druid magna mater, was the trefoil clover and shamrock, especially the last, known as Blanche Flour and “the pledge of union.” Every leaf of it, said those observant naturalists, is “impressed with the pale figure of the sacred crescent,” indeed wherever the great goddess trod, four of these Triads sprang up.5 An orchard was a sacred mystic place with Druids—a sort of Gan-Eden, where the gods could walk in the cool of the day, and out of this sacred orchard-grove alone, could the coel-breni or omen sticks be cut. A “perfect orchard” of 147 fruit trees which tallied perfectly with each other, was a most complete Druid circle, for 147 was a potent mystic number in its relation to the sacred 3 and 7—the Triad and weekly or planetary days, and an Orchard was a Cor or Caer.6 The great mother was, as in western Asia, called the Bee, Melissa, and her attendant priests Melissæ, nay in one northern dialect, her ark or ship is the Bee. 1 Cf.

The celebration of her mysteries is sometimes said to be “completed before dawn,” for she is goddess of darkness whose “great sacrifice” is at night. Welsh bards taught that there were three regions of existence called circles, the lowest El-bred or evil, containing matter, form and existence; the: Gwyn-wyd or felicity, in which virtuous men are to exist, and the third, the Cylch-y-cagant, or the all-enclosing circle, where God or his Spirit alone pervades.1 I have not thought it necessary in this work to combat some of the old arguments which have at different times been advanced by many and often learned writers, as to stones and stone circles merely marking and consecrating places for sepulture, for these have only gained credence with those ignorant of the customs of phallo-solar faiths. The refutation of the sepulchre theory will, I think, follow the acceptance of even a few of the numerous faets which this work deals with. No doubt sepulture has been proved in and around some, but by no means all ancient circles and monoliths, just as sepulture was the rule in and around many of our own churches; yet these last were none the less places dedicated to Jehovah, Jesus, Mary, or other representative of the faith. The Christian in burying his dead at the foot of the symbolic cross, only carries on the idea the old Kelt had, when he placed a revered corpse at the foot of his Maha Deva. Well did the learned Dr. D. Wilson complain, in 1867, that “archeological research” requires to be freed “from that limited range to which a too exclusive devotion to classical studies had given rise.” Few Europeans, either whilst students or at a period before their minds get fixed, and themselves more or less committed to certain views and opinions, have had the opportunity, or in this busy age, the time if they had the ability, to dive into the depths of such old records as led Bryant, Faber, Davies, Higgins, and other still more heterodox antiquaries outside the bounds of ordinarily received historical research. There are peculiar difficulties in these re-searches, to one who has not lived and studied, beyond the limits and sway of Europe and its curricula, for most Europeans become early shut up with the strong swathing bands of an all controlling orthodoxy, which meets them with a negative if not positive resistance, at every turn which these studies take. If the matter be not found in the ordinarily received classics and works of orthodox historians, neither teachers nor taught learn anything of it, nor have time, in these days of competition and high pressure, to dwell upon it. In vain for them did Faber, Davies and other, though clergymen, write on subjects which seemed to lead nowhere unless to the upsetting of all that the schools taught, and to the revival of those very topics and ideas of which churchmen—mostly our teachers—had for ages tried to efface both the imagery and memory. Such writings only cast doubt, if they did not upset orthodox “histories” like those of “the Fathers” and our “Saints,” Patrick, Nineus, Columba and Co., on which so much has bee built to try and prove the early establishment, good deeds, and 1 Her.

Of course it is an “upsetting of one’s faith” to see that many Bible stories, rites and good morality existed in Keltic scriptures “long before the sixth century, A.C., in an age when the Britains were acquainted with the Ro-mans, but whilst Rome itself as yet was Pagan,” as the Rev. E. Davies asserts. It is a fact also, that there is in the Kadeir Taliesin and most other old poems of a similar date, “an open profession of worship of the moon, and that amidst a general concourse of men, the lore of the Druids is declared to be meat for sovereign princes.”1 It is bewildering then to find here so much good and bad matter thought to be purely and solely Biblical, and no easy task to enter on the burning question of the common origin of these faiths. Few Englishmen have any conception of the strength and extent of the faith which once permeated every corner of these islands. Thickly enough as they are now dotted with churches and chapels, these are even yet by no means so numerous as were the old solar shrines, at least in some counties. The Cambrian Register of 1799 gave the names and localities of no less than 30 Druid Kromlechs within the 270 square miles of Anglesea or Mona’s isle—Ptolemy’s Mona-oida;2 and these 30—one to nine square miles—are but a remnant, after 1000 years of Christian persecution, succeeded by some considerable abount of previous intolerance; for Romans often attacked Druids and their shrines, and they did so here because these stirred up their flocks to oppose Rome. Suetonius entered upon the conquest of Mon-ige or Mon-ey in 60 A.C., and Romans here sternly ruled its Ordovices, (as they termed these Kelts) for three hundred years.3 Those who wish to judge of the strong and immoveable foundations on which Keltik circles and Druid faith existed, can scarcely turn to a better small work than that by the Rev. J. Rust, Druidism Exhumed.4 In his concluding chapter this author asserts that he has advanced “abundant proof to satisfy any unprejudiced individual that these structures (circles, dolmens, monoliths, &c.), were intended, erected and employed as temples; proof from an ancient, unbroken, uniform and universal tradition; proof from early Christian authors who kew well about the events which they recorded; and proof from Gaelic etymology, the earliest, the fullest, the most consistent and satisfactory which could be desired.” Nothing is clearer than that the worship of the people were stones single or in combination; male “stones of pledge, covenant, or testimony,” and feamle, in earth-bound rocks, caldrons, kistvaens, &c. Al “The Most High” of Gen. xiv., is seen in numerous strange combinations; in Al-teim he is the god or “stone of fire.” He usually appears as Ad, As, Ar, Art, Alt, &c., often now in ignorance transformed into the Scotch term auld for “old,” but by this author always translated “stone,” the symbol thus taking the name of the deity.5 1 British Druids, p. 279.

It is clear also from his facts that the people thoroughly saw through the solar eucharistic idea, viz., that “the warmer”—“the Sun of Righteousness”—was “made flesh for them,” and that, in fertilizing their cattle and raising grass and corn for them, he turned blood into milk, if not into wine, as was said by those inhabiting milder climes. It will perhaps give the reader the best idea of the very religious character of the people, and the all-pervading extent and force of their faith, if I here select a few of the roots or radical terms and words which occur most commonly in old Keltik, and also a few actual names of places to show how these combine. This will also illustrate the ety-mological arguments which are some of the strongest, and show how the names of the chief deities enter into those of places, tribes and heroes.

Only the specialist is bound to tell us this, and we make no pretensions to a knowledge or Irish, Gaelik, Welsh or Armorikan; but only, after full and careful research in the works of good specialists, to have placed before the reader the best con-clusions come to, concerning matters of faith. We are ware of many other significa-tions than those given here, and where the matter is of sufficient interest, these too, will elsewhere appear. Far greater fulness of meaning, direct and inferential, will also be found in our glossary, but fearing insufficient attention to the continuous reading of that somewhat formidable vocabulary, we have here selected only what should have immediate perusal. The most important words are those connected with the Testimony and its Ark, or with sacred stones and the divine symbol in the circle—the Eduth before which those Kelts made their vows—Ea, Esh, Gies, or Jes. The sacred place and the god, nay the city, that is the dwellings which rapidly clustered roudn the Salēm or “place of safety”—the Ark of Ier, soon became identical in name as well as thought. Thus Il-u, or El-e, became with Babylonians “a city,” and Ier is so in Hebrew. The G in Gie, ghe, gies, &c. is a very pliable letter, usually indeed silent, or in Keltik having the sound of n or ng, and making gies into Nes or mere nasel Es, that important radi-cal, and name of the Skand god of vows, and Hindoo Esh or Es-wāra. We see it also in Os, Is and Or, the Trinity of Egypt, in Bubastis, Is-ra-els, &c. Hebrews freely elide the g in Eduth, Eoduth, or Geduth; but what were these and other faith- terms prior to the writing age? this is the problem, and not their orthography and etymology, which it is desirable to solve. We have far too exaggerated ideas as to the age of Hebrew, Sanskrit, and Greek writings.1 Many philologists now assert that these were unwritten languages till about the fifth century B.C., and that all so- called prior literature, depended on good and bad memories, aided by the stone engraver, or painfully delineated uncial or hieroglyph-like scratchings. Criticism, direct and negative, has quite annihilated our personal Homer of 1000 B.C.; and we now discover that there is not a hint of either reading or writing being known through-out the Homerik Epik, nay, that the Greek language had no verbs equivalent to legere or scribere, and therefore that the Greeks could not have read or written till a late period. This is what we had long thought and frequently hinted at, before reading the statement in the authoritative article of Professor Paley. He states that there was no current literature during the Periklean era, 470-436 B.C., nor any means of writing, except on rude tablets smeared with wax; and he believes that if there had been, it would have been frowned down as destructive of memory; so an Egyptian King is fabled to have tried to stop writing when Toole introduced it into Egypt. The very word for book, byblos, was unknown in Greek till about 400 B.C., ex-cept asin the sense of a name for the papyrus plant, which however Pliny distinctly 1 Max Müller in Anc. Sansk.

The word Biblion, “a small piece of byblus,” first occurs in the Birds of Aristophanes of 415 B.C. Authors prior to this1 must have written on the waxed pine slips—deltoi and pinakes, for their own readings to the people, and all teachers must have taught orally, as did Sokrotes, Jesus, and Mahomed, who apparently could not write, and whose sayings and discourses have therefore of course, reached us mixed with the countless sayings, prejudices and traditions of too feeble-minded, if strong-memoried, Bards or story-tellers. Still, there was no literature, letter-writing or actual books. Per- gamos had parchment (perkarment) or prepared skins, such as the libraries of Ptolemy Phil: are said to have found the Jewish sacred books written upon, and from which the Alexandrian Doctors of 270 B.C. translated the Greek Septuagint Scriptures. They were the first real writers and book transcribers. Doubtless Greeks inscribed on Stelai in the days of Solon and Peisistratos, and Phenicians, Lukians and Etrurians, far earlier on stones and clay. Babylonaians stamped on the latter one thousand years earlier, and from them and Egyptians we are now obtaining long-buried libraries; but these were old growths besides the young Aryan influx, which only rose into import-ance on the ruins of a great Pelasgik people, and through Ionian and Achaian science and learning, which Greeks have successfully hidden from the world. There is a wide difference, as Professor Paley insists, between the stone cutter with his chisel and the student with his pen. He thinks that in the time of Herodotus there only existed the Bardik compositions of Hekataios and Aisopos or Esop, and that Greeks knew nothing of a library till the Alexandrian School of the Ptolemies arose. Herodotos quotes Hekataios three or four times, but never once mentions him as a writer, and he beings his own work as if very unconscious of previous writings, saying “he desires to set forth certain histories (researches) in case these vanish from man.” Thoukudides also seems only to have heard of Herodotos through the Bars, so that Professor Paley thinks that the prose writings we now have prior to, say 430 B.C., were eventually re-duced to writing from the too-treacherous memories of pupils, the Logioi, “story tellers or writers,” and the Aoidoi, or Bards. In that case it is unreasonable to sup-pose that we have not in these works, and all books of faiths of prior date, a host of traditions, ideas and events beloning to times much later than the supposed authors. In the writings of Plato, books are spoken of as a novelty, and after examining all the evidences for the actual writings of the Greek “Historians” mentioned below, Professor Paley finds they only rest on the statements of writers like Strabo, Plutarch, Diodorus, etc., living six hundred years or so after the would-be books, and probably grounded on mere hearsay. All this is of course very serious and far-reaching, unsettling faiths as well as histories; let us, however, accept and not shirk truths, and begin again at the beginning, and re-write all, and blot out our favourite fallacies. But to return. 1 As Solon, 594 B.C.; Peisistratos, 550 B.C.; Herodotos, Perikle, Thoukudides, 440 B.C., and Hekataios, 520 B.C.; Aischulos, 500 B.C.; others."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Source and Rise of European Alphabets. 343Skythians and Phenicians probably acquired their learning at or near to the same Asiatik home, and their languages in early times stood rather in a sisterly than a par-ental relation to each other. The old Berla Fene of Ireland has indeed been held to be a Phenician dialect, and it is only natural that. before Greek letters were used by Kelts, as Cesar says they were in his time both in social and public intercourse, the far earlier and more energetic pioneers of British commerce—a people for long infinitely superior, intellectually and scientifically, to Greeks—should have instructed and left a very abiding mark of their close intercourse, on the ignorant but apt populations of our islands. It was Phenicians, or as Greeks first called these, Aithiopians, who, under leaders of Kadmean and Achaian fame, first instructed their Arabian congeners, then Greeks, Jews, Africans, Umbrians and Etrurians, and afterwards Latin Kelts. Everywhere, indeed, from Mesopotamia to most western Mauritania, this wonderful people have exercised an immortal influence on all the lauguages, arts, science, and faiths of Europe. The arguments of Toland of 1717 have been upheld by a host of competent scholars, viz., that Kelts brought away previous to the fourteenth century B.C., an alphabet of thirteen letters, then current in Kaldia or Aithiopia, and increased it to sixteen or seventeen before Grecians or Thracians got their alphabet of sixteen letters. To this Kadmus, the Phenician or Eastern, afterwards made additions, but these Kelts having passed away westwards before 1400 B.C., were unable to partake of the Kadmian and later improvements, which they undoubtedly would otherwise more or less have done. It is resonably argued by Higgins, writing about one and a quarter century after Toland and Huddleston, that the old Irish, “Beth-Luis-nion Ogam,” having like some Keltik languages, only thirteen, and never more than sixteen or seventeen letters, is older than the Kadmean, the Hebrew, Samaritan, or square character of Shemitik Babylon; and if so, the alphabet of Kelto-Irene Culdee Druids, is most probably that of the old Chaldee priests of Arabi-Irak.

The Keltik of Iberia, Gaul, Britan and Ire-land.2 4. Greek of period prior to, say, Trojan war; Kekropian (?). 5. Old Latin. 6. Old Teutonik.

He is amazed at their energy, diligence and fertility of resource, whether as traders, mariners, miners or agricultur-ists. He describes their different irrigation works, tunnellings, tortuous channels, and mechanical appliances like the “Egyptian screw,” etc., all proofs of that engineer- ing talent so characteristic of British Kelts, who were largely recruited and from the very earliest times, by these Kelto-Iberian tribes. Indeed Strabo shows that there was an old and energetic rivalry between the miners of Turdetania and our own islands, which considering the affinity of race and religion and its long duration, must have knit the people also pretty closely, linguistically and otherwise. Pinkerton and Sammes write: “All the customs, religion, idols, offices and dignities of Britains are Phenician, and Druidism is palpably so;” and this, a number of writers confirm. The Roman occupation, though far more extensive, only lasted about one-third of the time the Phenician traders lived and worked along our coasts. Most of the African and Spanish seaports were thronged and probably owned by them, about the twelfth century B.C. They then founded Cadiz or Gadir, where there was a chief temple to Herakles their Saturn or Ra-El, as their Sun-God was indifferently named. The re1igion and architecture which they then taught, was adhered to far into our ear. Like the Jews, who from a Phenician source got their Yachaveh or Yahue worship, the Gadirites as good solarists, allowed no image of this Sun-God in their temple. Only an ever-burning fire could symbolize him, and barefooted priests, clad in linen, and with tonsured heads—emblemizing his disk—tended the sacred fire and waited on his rites.3 The tonsure, either on the top or back of the head, was an Egyptian, Phenician and Druidik symbolism, for to Sivaites the head was to the body what the glans is to the lingum, and sacred to Sol, and therefore depicted as a disk, with a dot in the centre, as we find on Keltik stones, and still on Indian rocks, as in Kamāon.4 In true character we observe that Phenician priests also wore a conical cap or helmet, like the phalik priests of Asyria, Rome, etc. Wherever Phenicians traded also, certain well-known Phenician fetes obtained; for instance, that known as the Sardinian fires on I-on’s or St. John’s eve, when all tribes were taught to meet at their circles and village Hermi or lingams and to partake of particular viands, such as fried 1 Druids, p. 24. 2 Ibid., p. 16.

Druid and Christian Sacrifices. 345eggs and sundry herbs.1 Phenicians and Kelts, at the vernal Equinox fetes, lighted, danced around, and leaped through fires, giving themselves freely up to the natural exhileration then marking all creation. Up to the present time, we are frequently reminded of the long intercourse these islands have had with Phenicians, by the discovery of Phenician coins of probably even pre-Grecian days, as well as many pure Greek coins of the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., which have been found under strata ascertained to be pre-Roman. The Phenician coins belong to cities of Asia Minor, and have on them altars dedicated to the Tyrian Herakles and Asyrian Astarte, the favourite deities of these great traders.2 To Kuklopian Phenicians doubtless, does Sardinia owe those three thousand and odd noorhags, and other bee-hive shaped structure, somewhat like our “Picts houses,” “duns” or “burghs,” and the old Irish towers, of which more hereafter. Most ancient Romans gazed upon these noorhags with as much or more wonderment than even we do. Fig. 7 of our Plate VI., Vol. I., shows the form of a noorhag. It is too commonly thought that the Druidik faith was peculiar to the British Isles and adjoining coasts; but this is not the case. It was all over southern Europe, and edicts were passed by both the Emperors Augustus and Tiberius forbidding it in Rome, and their generals were commanded to suppress it as much as possible, because the Druidik priests were powerful enough to set aside or at least stultify, many Roman laws. Justus, about 500 A.C., asserted that human sacrifices were then being offered to the gods by Druids, and he forcibly urged the suppression of this, not from a Christian point of view, nor says Gibbon3 from any dislike to human sacrifices, for Rome was tolerant of all faiths, and freely acknowledgcd that Keltik deities were “real gods”; but because of the great influence of the Druid priests, specially upheld by this power of life and death. The result of the suppression, except perhaps when the Druids were for a time roasted alive as in Angles-ey, was only to drive the disease—human sacrifices and other pious rites—into secret nooks, and make these still dearer to all good Kelts; whilst we have convincing proofs that beyond Roman rule, human sacri-fice ever continued, and the necessity for it was reasserted when the Legions left. Nor can we acquit the priests and flocks of the new faith, nor indeed of any religion, of some form or other of human sacrifice. Much study and practical experi-ence of the divers modes by which wild races acromplish this and other vile rites, and yet conceal them from even their own kinsmen and most intimate friends, if not shut their own eyes to their deeds of darkness, makes us wary in this respect. We are not satisfied as to the making away of either Aaron or Moses, nor of those “whom the earth swallowed up,” or whom Yahue is said to have from time to time killed; and we certainly cannot acquit “Saint Columba” of the quiet disappearance of his good 1 Forster’s Sardinia; cf.

All Kelts believed in “the Spirit of the Earth” and its “Ehterial fire,” requiring like all fires, something to devour. They held that it was because a man had been buried in its fonndations that the earth was so stable. A slain Christ was said to be “the corner-stone” of the new Zion on which all the Churches rested, “the foundation of Apostles and Prophets”; and the second Jericho was apparently founded on the eldest son, and its gates on the second son of the Royal Founder.1 Blood has been the cry of all faiths save those of Boodha and Confucius, and if Keltik Christian propagandists required to know, pagan Kelts could truthfiilly assure them, that no success had ever been achieved on earth, no altar or structure worthy of consideration ever raised, without the sprinkling of human blood on the foundations. In England, did not the celebrated fort of Snowdon continually fall to pieces, until “the stones and mortar had been sprinkled with the blood of a child who had no father?” and who were Columba, Patrik, and others, that they should expect the first edifice of their faith to be raised until they had shed the blood of the voluntary martyr? Accordingly, we find the Gaelik races maintaining, that Columba “buried St. Oran (his brother missionary) alive beneath the foundations of his (Columba’s) monastery, in order to propitiate the Spirit of the soil.”2 The building alluded to was the first Christian Church of Scotland in Hy, or Christian Iona—approriate name, and one like Doorga or Dhune,3—demanding human sacrifice. The sacrificial details on this occasion are those common to the East, and we have here to do with Eastern blood and lineage. The Saint on arrival announced thnt not only should “he who first died for the cause, at once go to Christ” but that he would also confirm their right to the island by corporeal possession.” What good sheep in the flock could withstand this appeal, not to speak of a true brother? Nay, it would be unfair even to-day, to so tempt the islanders to a possession of their loved isle? The ecclesiastical history naively states that “Oran, wearied with the miseries of the present world, joyfully accepted the option;” on which the good High Priest ordered certain special and immediate honors for the beloved brother, as doubt Moses had done for Aaron, and Joshua for Moses, “after which the poor Oran fell sick, and in a very short time expired,” and the saintly crew entered upon the possession of their promised land. The various sacrificial rites of the Old Testament, and the propitiatory idea of the New, would be thoroughly congenial to the Keltik mind and moral code. There was nothing horrible or revolting to the Kelts, Picta, Gauls, Belgæ, etc. of those or later days, in such Hebrew texts as I quote below, any more than to ancient Jews and to all Syrians.

As a learned bishop states, this “patriarchal act of Faith” (in what? a dream!) “implies that at this time the custom in question actually existed, and was practised habitually by pious persons . . . . as in Jephthah’s case,” and when the Beth-El-ite, Hiel, sacrificed his eldest son in the foundations of the walls of Jericho, and his youngest, Seguh, at its gate;1 and these were customs common to Canaanites as well as to Hebrews, and indeed to “all ancient nations, civilized and uncivilized, down to the birth of Christianity and after it.”2 Pennant, in his Tour to the Druidik temple and Karn, once the holy shrine of Saint Oran, says that the Saint voluntarily consented to be buried alive below the foundation, because the builders were continually interrupted by evil spirits, who would not let the structure proceed till a man had been sacrificed. This done, no further interruption took place, and the shrine was named “Saint Oran’s Kill,” after the victim. But, as the Editor of Toland’s Druids points out, the rite was simply a Druidik one, insisted upon by the original owners of the place and their Druid priests. The later Christian explanation that Oran was put to death for blasphemy is absurd in the face of Columba’s dedicating the edifice to him; indeed Pennant shows that the half-Druid Columba had to further conform, before the Sacred Circle and Clacha Brath or “stones of judgement,” were handed over to the Chriatians; and even then it would seem that arrangements for the continuation of certain annual rites were made, for down to 1772, the circum-ambulation of the old shrines; with mysterious “turnings of balls,” continued to be practices, if they be not so still. Volumes might be filled with narrations of the human sacrifices of our ances-tors, and the diabolical murderings and torturings for their “Lord’s sake,” of poor witches and heretics of every degree and phase of faith. Indeed, it is difficult says the learned Professor Kalisch,3 “to find a people (we know of none) who were wholly free from this dire superstition—human sacrifices to please their deity.” Egyptians, Phenicians, Asyrians, Arabians, Athenians, Spartans, Etrurians, Romans, the Hindoo in the East, and the Mexican in the West, Thracians and Syrians, Gauls and Teutons, Saxons and Swedes, Danes and Pomeranians—all have taken part in the celebration of these bloody rites. And they were practised down to a comparatively late age, and in the midst of the highest civilization, as well as among the most barbarous tribes. In fact, as one has said, “in every generation of the four centuries, from the fall of the Republic to the establishment of Christianity, human victims were sacrificed by the Roman emperors, while the old Prussians and Goths adhered to the customs for cen-turies after their nominal adoption of Christianity.” The Sim-nones, or Senones, a great tribe who once burnt Rome, and who are termed “the most ancient and noble of the Swevi Kelts, met” said Tacitus, “for human sacrifice at a stated season of each 1 Colenso’s Lectures on Pentateuch, chap. ix.

These Suevi sacrificed to their favourite Mars, Ern or Ars—the earliest phalik form of Mercury—as well as to Isis Queen of Heaven, who was veiled3 like the Isis of Egypt. When she was seated in her chariout drawn by white heifers, peace reigned and no sword was unsheathed. Cesar saw neither Druids nor sacrifices in Germany, but Tacitus speaks of both in connection with the Suevi. The more pious the Israelite, the more did be desire to kill and then burn his most precious offering on Yahue’s altar; and it is certain all did so throughout our islands, according to the universal practice of Solo-Phalik worshippers. Yahue demanded and recived from Israel the first and “fulness” of all fruits and produce, including the first-born of all sons, the ox and the sheep from the eighth day after birth, and without spot or blemish.4 It is generally held by good critics that the story of Abraham substituting a ram for Isaac, was written or known of in the seventh century, and only accentuated as it were about Ezra’s time, for the purpose of breaking off human. sacrifices to some ex-tent, by showing the people that Yahue would accept in lieu an unoffending and probably more innocent creature. This most of the Seers and teachers accordingly began to urge, saying that their God “had not commanded . . . . that neither had it come into his heart” to order such horrors. Nevertheless, they acknowledge that it had not been so previously, but that Jehovah had “given them statutes which were not good, judgements whereby they should not live, and defiled them in their gifts”!5 Christianity still kept up the sacrificial idea when she urged her votaries to bury themselves in caves and dens of filth, or damp and gloomy cloisters; by torturing mind and body, and denying themselves all natural affections and worldly pleasures. They thus strove to make the world as gloomy and miserable as possible, to please the Maker and Giver of all good things! Cesar describes the Gauls or Kelts as exactly the people likely to enthusiastically adopt any such faith. He says: “These tribes are exceedidingly superstitious . . . . those who labour under fatal illnesses, and those who engage in battles and dangers, either immolate human sacrifices, or vow that they will immolate themselves . . . . . because they believe that human life is necessary toward propitiating the divine nautre of the immortal gods . . . . They publicly institute and perform such sacrifices.” Kelts therefore would readily embrace the Christian doctrine of the necessity of Christ’s vicarious sacrifice, even though they natrually did not like to sacrifice “the innocent for the guilty,” preferring criminals, as Herod6 also suggested to the Jews in the case of 1 Toland’s Druids, p. 323. 2 Ibid., p. 267. 3 Ibid., p. 258; and see our fig. 198, p. 62. 4 Exodus xxii. 5 Jeremiah vii. 31, xix. 5, xxxii. 35; Ezekiel xx. 25-26. 6 [s.b. “Pilate” (Mark xv. 6-15). — T.S.] "},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Ancient and Modern Salvation by Blood. 349Fig.272.—THE BAPTISM OF BLOOD OF THE FIRST BE-GOTTEN “SUN.” ALLEMBLEMS REPRESENTED.

That blood was, however, felt to be a necessity, we even yet see in the hymns, prayers, and devout literature of many of the most earnest Christian sects; and lest the readers of such books as this may have forgotten “the Rock whence they were hewn, and the hole of the pit whence they were digged” (the phalik language in which Isaiah described the production of his race), let us remember that Messrs. Moody and Sankey lately proclaimed all over these islands, and were “cheered to the echo,” that “our God has adhered to blood from that of righteous Abel to sinless Christ.” “Any religion,” said Sankey, “that is not fonnded on the Blood, comes from the pit of hell . . . The only road to heaven is on the tide of Christ’s precious blood.” This was the oldest and is still the firmest doctrine of the churches, and only the other day did The Church Times, a leading ecclesiastical organ, endorse the following—red enough for even Messrs Moody and Sankey:— “ Lamb most holy! King most lowly! Golden chalice at Thy side!1 Blood is flowing, red and glowing, For the Church, thy holy Bride.” Some verses follow which are shockingly revolting, as to feeding upon and laving the blood. It thus concludes:— “ Ever flowing, red and glowing, Is the blood-stream from Thy side; Feeding, laving, cheering saving, Holy Church, Thy chosen Bride.” Kelts had never known such praise of blood, although they occasionally collected “the blood of the slain” into Ceridwen’s sacred chauldron—the chalice, kalix, or femi-nine symbol of the God; and is it not a chalice of blood which the new faith here repre-sents the Heavens or Yahave, whom Kelts would call “the Thorn-God,” pouring over the rising “Sun of Righteousness?” This was administer-ing a “Baptism of Blood” most congenial to the ideas of Kelts as well as Indians; but Venus and the blood vessel contain of course, older ideas than even these. The race clung closest to those parts of the new faith which were most like their old, and we here give a few quotations from a London Hymn collection of 1754 to show how long the most revolting ideas were adhered to and esteemed as highly religious. “ What greater glory could there be Than to be clothed with God?

Nothing was precious in God’s sight But God’s own precious blood. . . . . . 1 The reader of these volumes will know the chalice-symbol."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 350 ‘ I am the door,’ said Christ;1 the spear’s sad art Now hath unlocked Him at the very heart. . . . . . . . For — The Saviour pressed to death, there ran Out of His sacred wounds That wine which glads the heart of man, And all his foes confounds. No Polynesian cannibal or “far-west” scalper could say more, and yet Mr. Spurgeon equalled this only the other day, when summing up what he called his “Heavenly Message of Glad Tidings!” He said “Do you know what it is revives my spirits always? It is Christ crucified. . . . There is nothing here for us. We want the blood of a Saviour’s bleeding veins. . . . I loved sin, but He snatched me as a brand from the burning, and quenched me by His blood.” After which, a large London congregation, rejoicing in these sentiments, sang “a favourite hymn”— “ E’er since by faith I saw the stream His flowing wounds supply.” . . . It would be easy to go on ad nauseam. Even the blood which fell during cir-cumcision, when “the babe is wounded for our sakes,” is dwelt upon by many churches with much gusto, as may be seen from hymns now in current use. Evangelical Kelts carried their love of “the blood” into severe practice; they constructed huge hollow figures of gods or men out of highly inflammable materials, as grass and osiers, and into these they thrust the victims—men or first-born—after the manner of the Jews in the valley of Hinom, and of other neighbouring tribes. Some say that they did so in order to increase the “sweet savour” of the roasting fat and flesh, which Yahue and similar early gods loved. Bad however as Druidism was to its children on earth, it never imagined that it was thus giving them a foretaste of the fires of hell, which the Jews first and then the Gentiles abstracted from Persia, and passed on to the Christians to be furbished up with fresh horrors, and prolonged to “all eternity.” This refinement of misery the inventors of the original idea had never dreamt of; but a temporary sojourn in a hell however bad, was insufficient for northern Christians, who mostly rejected even the idea of a purifying purgatory. The Druids, as vicegerents of the gods, considered that they disposed of the sinner’s earthly acts when they punished him here below, whether by their ordinary legal processes, or as a living sacrifice for his own sins or those of others. He was not again to be brought up upon the same pleas; it then only remained for the gods to receive back their children. The immortality of the soul and metempsychosis were inculcated, and this, says 1 So Siva is called the Dhwārka-Nāt, or “God of the Door,” of Life, or the Yoni."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Keltik Faith, Rites, Customs, and Civilization. 351Cesar, “in the opinion of the Druids, takes away the fears of death, and incites the people to the highest degree of virtue,”1—arguments used by those who do not believe in Christianity, but think it necessary for the masses. The later Kelts, probably of the Columban period, appear to have taught, says the Rev. B. Gould, “that the soul (not the body) was at once transported to heaven at death, and entered into eternal bliss,”—a step in advance of their successors, who required the resuscitation of the putrified and long ago dissipated body; even the soul was held by many until quite lately, to be a bona fide organ in the body, like the heart or lungs. Kelts had always been such great wanderers, that every Eastern or Egyptian theory appears to have been known, thought over, and to some extent held by them. We even hear of the idea held by Egyptians about 4000 B.C., that the soul remains for a time with the disintegrating body till purified from all sin, when it joins a purified body, called by the Egyptians the Sahou. As great travellers and mariners, Kelts had learned, says Cesar, to “reason largely concerning the stars and their motions. the magnitnde of the universe, the earth’s relations thereto, and the power and government of the inunortal gods”— so that Romans did not find Druids ignorant as to science and religion. They knew all the gods of Rome, and had all the fetes and organization of the most advanced nations, with seminaries, colleges, synods, and orthodox centres for general assemblies or councils, as Christianity has at the seats of bishops and archbishops.2 Wiltshire had such a centre in Amber-bury or “the holy Bury,” and in Stonehenge, and all good Karnu-utes met in Mid-Gaul Casar and Tacitus show that Druidism extended over every part of these islands and of Gaul if not Germany, and that the gods were rudely symbolized, the stone pillar or Lingam having here and there given place to an image, which no doubt, the Romans assisted the people in perfecting. We find also figures of Mars, Sul-Minerva, Mercury, etc., which archæologists say belong to a period four hundred years after Cesar’s time. That great statesman always kept an arch-Druid, Divitiacus, or “the godly one” by his side, which makes all his information doubly valuable; yet he was told that “the natives of the interior of Britain were Aborigines, and only those on the coast Belgæ” or Belgik Kelts, so that “the Aborigines” had arrived at a time too distant for Divitiacus to trace their descent. Cesar describes the population of our islands as “immense, and all living in houses similar to the Gauls. they had abundance of minerals, which were both largely ex-ported, and used in the arts and for ornaments. There was money in bronze and iron, coins and rings.” Yet Cesar saw no corn, and thinks the poople lived chiefly on flesh and milk. They would not however taste the hare, the hen or the goose. They 1 Gal. Wars, vi. 14. 2 Rust’s Druidism Exhumed, and De Bello Gal-ico, v., xvii., &c.

Their clothing was of hides, and as to their social armngements, he says: “Ten or twelve men have wives in common among them; and especially brothers with brothers, and parents with children; but if there are any offspring, they are accounted as belonging to those who first attached them-selves to the particular virgin”—a statement which we may hope is false. It is very possibly due to ignorance of the language; for uncles and cousins are called, in some of the vernaculars of India, fathers, brothers and sisters, either out of respect or by way of endearment; and we have heard Englishmen, who should have known better, both as to the idiom of the language and social life of Indians, speak of their relationships somewhat like Cesar. Of course polygamy, as well as slavery, prevailed among the blue savages. Intense reverence for parents was a virtue however, stringently incul-cated, although the social law-makers probably only framed those most agreeable to their own order, as parents and husbands. Many strange instances of parental tyrrany and reverence were still in force among our northern clans only a generntion or so ago. In some families no child could stand up in the presence of its father, or, until reaching puberty, approach him in public. Fathers had the power of life and death over both wives and children, and if any thing looked suspicious at a great man’s decease, these were liable to torture unto death, which was usually with fire. It was common to cremate slaves and clients who were held in esteem by the dead, as well as to entomb with him all things which he specially valued in life, and these are still well-known Asiatik customs. Nothing was spared by the selfish tyrants to make their obsequies as sumptuous as possible; and we may rejoice that we did not live “in these good old times.” The plebeian, wrote the Roman general, is altogether a slave to the noble, and over both the Druid exercised the most galling of priestly tyranny; for he ruled despotically in all mattern, not only in public, but socially and privately, and over all things spiritual and temporal. All controversies, religious or secular, were referred to him, and thus he virtually held all lands and heritages in his rapacious grasp, cutting off from the altar and sacrifices “every one disobedient or impious”—loose words, of which he alone was interpreter. The offender was thus not only “cut off from all future justice, but could receive no honour,” and socially, no one could hold any communication with the anathematised one. The arch-Druid was chosen by the suffragee of the Druids, which was not, how-ever, always accomplished without bloodshed. The great annual meeting in the Carnutia, or the territory of the Karn-ites in Gaul, near Chartres or Orleans, exercised, says Cesar, supreme jurisdiction there, and “is supposed to have been devised in Britain.” All Druids were exempt from taxes and military service; and enjoyed many other immunities which of course made parents and relatives strive to get their children into so noble, holy and altogether desirable a service, the only labour of "},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Druidik Writings, Character. The Jovine Oak. 353which consted in learning verses and dogmas by heart, but for this they were al-lowed about twenty years; and they lived during all that time in a great and no doubt, luxurious central institution. Not being considered discreet, it was made un-lawful to commit the holy rituals to writing, although in almost all other matters the commercial classes probably wrote pretty freely, but in Greek letters, says Cesar. The Druids had forgotten their old secret priestly written character—Ogham or other, and to have used Greek, though only the Greek character, would have exposed all their rites and tenets to the whole community, Roman as well as Keltik, an idea abhorrent to all priests. Besides, they feared lest the students, in consequence of trusting to the aid of writing, might less sedulously cultivate their memories. Most Asiatiks still act in this way. Nothing could horrify a Brahman more than to see a Soodra reading the Vedas, and only though our rule is this now tolerated. The Romans describe all Kelts as especially worshipping Apollo—Ap-ellia or Ab-Ele—and Mercury or Hermes, whom Montfaucon correctly calls the ancient Mithras,1 i.e. Mih-Ra or the great Ra, or Mith or Math, the Fertilizier. Michael or Mah-Ka-El (M‘Kāl = M‘K‘al, “the great Lord Al” or Alt) lattery became the favourite half phalik deity of Britons even in Christian times. Under his form of Mars, he received all the spoils of war, which Cesar says were invariably heaped up in consecrated places for him or rather his Druids. No layman dare touch these, and all captured cattle were directed to be driven there, ostensibly for the sacrifices, but in reality for the priests, who be it remembered did not fight them-selves, though thus securing the profits of war. The Druids were then not only a numerous, but a wealthy and irresponsible hierarchy, often of noble lineage, and embracing both sexes. The reigning monarch or political head of the tribes could not resist their power, and Rome found that she must repress them, that is kill or more probably burn them, wherever she tried to conquer and hold the country. The Druids, on their part, desired rather to avoid than covet martyrdom, so they betook themselves when in fear to the neighbouring islands, the fastnesses of Wales, or the lake diatricts, or still further northwards; and as, during the whole four hundred and fifty years of Roman role, the legions never got much beyond the wall of Agricola, or say, to Sterling in Alba; and never into Ireland at all, the heart of the. Druid system remained, and in Scotland was in full power up to the 7th century. It had, however, much degenerated, and Druids were looked upon as only more or less learned sorcerers and magicians, with no title to the true meaning of Magi or Great Ones, for Europe mostly misunder- stands this word. It is in the East, Ma-Jee or Mahā-Jee, simply “Great Lord or Master,” and not necessarily connected with either magic or fire. 1 Herbert’s Stonehenge, p. 122.

A Druidte was in fact the “Circle Man,” as the New Zealander is called in Polynesia a Maori from his Maoris or circles; and from the Druidical predilec- tions for holy mounds, groves and circles, formed by huge lithoi, or by heaping and extracting earth, or by scratching circles upon holy stones or on the ground, wherein to perform their strange incanta-tions, as do those gross organ worshippers the Indian Tantraists, and as we see here done by this old Gaulik deity1 who unites the sexual organs with the phalik reptile—from all these causes combined we have good reasons for calling Druids “Men of the Circle.” The Drui was the symbol of, if not the early goal, and J. Grimm shows us that Germans were called Alle-manns after Alh or Ale, the domus, naos or enclosed place of their god Alle, Alh or Alx.3 The reader will find matter for the derivation of Druid very fully given in our glossary, and the re-sult seems to be that it probably comes from the old Irish word Duir or Dair, the Jovine oak or centre of the holy place, circle or grove. Hence the Gauls called their sacred place in Karn-utia, Dreux, and in Gaelik a retired or contemplative man is called an Umbracht or Druidte, from Umbracam and Druidam, “to shut up or enclose.” Of course there would be Druidik grades, more especially as the priestly class held both a sacred and secular office, for they alone administered the judicial and criminal law, probably owing to the ignorance of the kings or chiefs; and if they oppressed the wretched Karn-neachs, “children of the Karns,” they also protected them to some extent. The K7uldees were probably charged with the lay courts, as they seem latterly to bave been a less divine body than the white-robed men of God, who, with sacred wand, rod, crozier and Apolonite arrow, wielded all the powers of nature; even the winds and waves obeyed them. We do not know how much Europe owes to Druids in the way of sacred rites and symbols. They, as Kuths or Skuths, gave to churches their croziers, womanly garments,4 and white robes and phylacteries generally; and to kings, governors and courts, their sceptes, maces, rods and batons, without which no legal ceremony is even yet valid. It was the Druid Skuth Abaris who first showed and then conferred his magic arrow, spear or per- haps mere painted staff upon Pythagoras, and Toland argues that Abaris was an 1 Maurice’s Ants., Front.

The Urim and Thummim of Druids were their magical “snakes’ eggs” and the sacred sprig of almond, their hazel-rod and mistleto of phalik significance. The “Misselto or Uil’ice” was required to be taken if possible from the Jovine tree when in its prime, but it was rare to find it on any oak. If obtained from one about thirty-five years old and taken in a potion, it conferred fertility on men, women or animals. It bears a mysterious relation to the Acorn which supports Luna.1 These Karn-neachs purified themselves with fire and holy water, collecting the latter with the greatest care in channels and reservoirs on their altars, as we see South Americans did in fig. 15 of Plate XVI., before it could be contaminated by earthly touch, and they sprinkled themselves with it, as did Greeks at Eleusis and on entering their holy places,2 and as do Christians still. What have we that is not archaic? CULDEES OR CHALDEES.—The word Chaldi or Culde is in Irish often written Cele-n-de, and the superior of Culdees was termed Cen-Celende, but the chief Culdee, if an arch-Druid, was a Coibhi, pronounced Coifi, of which one was the chief councillor of Edwin King of Northumbria, in the seventh century, when he was converted to Christianity. A Coif Drui is still a title denoting extreme merit in Scotland and Coifi comes from Gaelik words signifying a valiant and noble man and a protector. Ecclesiastical writers inform us the Irish Kuldees were employed by St. Patrik and his successors as lay ecclesiastics, and in the Register of the Scotch Priory of St. Andrews it is stated that “there were in the Church of St. Augustine—such as it then was, thirteen by carnal succession whom they call Keldees, who lived according to their own opinion and the tradition of men, rather than according to the statute of the holy fathers . . . They had incomes and possessions which, when they died, their wives, whom they kept publicly (implying that the orthodox clergy kept theirs privately?), their sons and relatives, divided among themselves.” St. Andrews was an old Keltik or Kuldee settlement called Kil-ri-mont, or “Temple on King’s Mount,” which when Christianity took it over, it did so with rites and ceremonies apparently dictated by the Kuldees; at all events, such as no good Kuldee would object to. The old shrine was circumambulated by the bishop and clergy seven times, while they sang and chanted like Kuths, Greeks, and all Keltæ; after which they erected twelve stones (with crosses) round it, and then the Kuldee “circle,” was called “St. Andrews” ! ! This took place in 825, but still “the Kuldees performed divine (?) worship in a certain corner of the church after their own manner,” probably after the manner of St. Columba, who was evidently a Kuldee, and whose teaching and discipline, if not rites, were probably those which 1 Toland’s Druids, p. 265; cf.

"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 356Bishops Epiphanius and Eusebius denominated as the “Skuthian heresy.”1 The St. Andrews Register further relates, that “this evil”—these Druidik or Kuldee services—“could not be removed till the time of King Alexander,” so that, as Toland’s historian states, “in the Church of Kil-ri-mont the Culdees and Christian clergy performed their divine worship in one and the same church during nearly three hundred years.” It is evident that Druids merged into Kuldees, and that the whole Keltik priesthood had from the fourth century, owing to Papal pressure or discipline, given up the strict dogmas and rites of their faith, and had accepted and embodied the new religion with what they still held to be good in their own. This view is supported by the fact of there being no Druid or Kuldee martyr,2 and the ease with which the writings of the old faith were seized and destroyed. The Druids freely allowed their Teampuls, Kills, or Ceals (pronounced Keels), and their Daimh-leach or Cloch-an-Dichtor (stone or “obelisk of the teacher”), to be used by the new preachers, and to these causes are due the success of the Phadriks in Mikra Brettania, or “Little Britain,” as Ptolemy called Ireland. The Kuldees, if more particularly charged with the secular duties of their order, would be looked upon as the rulers of the Girths or judicial circles, and preside at the Cloch-a-Bhreaths (vreas) or “stones of judgment,” and not so much at. the religious circles or obelisks; for there was a marked difference between the sacred mount, stone3 or circle used only for sacrifice, prayer and praise, and the judicial stone (Cloch o Drich) or secular mount or circle to which all might go with their grievances. It is said that these circles are generally found adjoining each other, as Westminster Abbey adjoins our high courts and royal place of assemblies. The holy places were generally also in sacred groves, and if possible, naturally planted ones, or at least accounted such—for all Pala-diums were considered by the orthodox to have come down from heaven. We still know of many holy or “hallow woods,” which originally our Keltik ancestors called Alla-feadh4 or feadhs of the Al, Alt, or “High One,” and these would be places for local assemblies corresponding to our halls for the meetings of synods or presbyters, and subject to the decisions of such great centres as Amber-bury or Avebury. This word is said to come from amber, “holy,” pronounced aver, the mb being v in Keltik. The Welsh called it the Choir Gour, or place for a great or “General assembly.” It was held to be an essential religious rite with Skyths, to assemble annually for sacrifice, praise, prayer, and deliberation over their affairs, at some central and hallowed spot. Greeks met for their Olympian fetes at Elis, the Dorik Al-is, the sacred place of Pelasgik Kelts—great Ar or Al worshippers; Gauls or Armorikans at 1 Toland, p. 413, and Chron.

Perched high on this castle rock, and now within the fortifications, but still bearing evidence of once overhanging the steepest face, stands the sacred cell or kill of the old tribes, now called, and still reverently cherished as, “The Chapel of St. Margaret”—an old classic name signi-fying “Moti” or “Pearl” in the East, and crorresponding with the Indian Parvati or Yoni of the race. As usual in all such cases, we find that far away below—buried deep in a shady nook under the sternest cliffs of Edina’s rock, is the sacred Nymphœum, a holy spring or well, appropriately enshrined in masonry, and that too of quite modern construction, and erected by a Keltik regiment which was quite innocent of the raison d’être of the whole,—it was in the air or the blood! At all events, these highlanders fulfilled the wishes of their remote ancestors. No Sivaite could even now mistake the meaning of this sacred spring under the most vertical cliffs of the holy hill, with its crown-capped shrine above. The position is perfect, as we can assert, from having seen Māya’s or Pārvati’s little shrine on many a similar rocky height, and her holy waters and nether chapel resting as here in the dark dell below. It was at such Kāli-like shrines on lone mountain sides in central India, and among Ghonds, Bheels and Kols, that human sacrifices used to take place, and where they are still probably offered, despite the Government. Down the rocky banks of the holy Narbuda, where a tiny-looking cell surmounted by a small flag appears on the high edge of a great precipices with rugged rocks and, perhaps a dark pool or shrine below, there men sought for “eternal salvation” by throwing themselves from the upper temple, to be dashed to pieces as they ricochetted from crag to crag, till their mutilated bodies fell with a sullen thud on the plat- form of the nether goddess, or sank to eternal rest in the still dark pool of the holy river which laves her sacred ghāt. “Without blood there can be no remis- sion of sins,” said the Sivaite priest, nay, as often the priestess; and what will not the superstitiously devout offer in this insane plea.? I hope to give some graphic instances of such immolations—once very common and usually quite voluntary—in my chapter on Eastern Aborigines. Nothing could be more sacrilegious in the eyes of our ancestors than the removal or desacration of their circles, karns, or lithoi generally, and the same feeling prevails to some extent yet. On this account the priests of the new faith sometimes buried these symbols, an action which Eastern races consider holy and sanctifying.

Advancing light prohibited even the offering of the fatted calf, and only secretly sanctioned the pouring out of milk and other libations, but still pious Kelts would ever and again visit the sacred spots, and on the adjoining tree or crag, hang small thank-offerings or reminiscences of their pilgrimage —such shred or flags as we find on sacred trees and Karns like this in Tatary, and in Polynesia as well as in Scotland and the Americas. As a rule these streamers, hung on sacred trees and poles, merely carry out the twisted-serpent idea which European Kelts with their Hags, Ascs or Aiscs, were at one time quite as partial to, as their Asiatik forefathers or the wandering Jews. Egyptians exhibited the same idea, as in Rano’s sacred symbol and charm, which Sharpe says3 they wore as a talisman in the form of fig. 275, but with streamers hanging on or over the phalik god, who embraces the solar disk, and wears, fit symbol of his faith, the mortar and pestle hat. The reader is familiar with the serpentine streamers that decorate all Boodhist and Hindoo temple poles, and has had his attention already called to the “hangings of the grove,” and of Magian and Fijian phali given at pp. 139 ante. The wrecks of faiths indeed seem to have drifted off the Eastern Continents for these far Oceanik races; for they too worshipped the phalik solar Ra under that same Indian and Egyptian name, and similarly to Turanian and Aryan peoples, on circles and mounts, and in kils or caves.

Ancient Irish. 359closely to the orthodox tri-form philological classification; forgetting that this does not necessarily denote races, as of Aryans, Shemites, and Turans. Thus Greeks seem to have been a joint production of Pelasgi, Achaians, Ionians and other remnants of Turanian Aithiopians, but Aryanized Phenician peoples; and the old Irish had evidently passed through some such phase when traversing the lands of Turanian-Phenicians, before Kadmus had increaaed the Greek alphabet. These Iers must have known Aithi-opio-Chaldees and Phenicians prior to the period when the Syrian Hebrew obtained its present numher of letters;1 for the Irish Culdees had the Beth, Jod, Mem, and Nun, or birch, yew, vine and ash, similar to the Chaldees of Babylon, and both races named their letters after trees. Thus many things point to these Irans or Ir-Aryans hail- ing from the lands of Arabi Irak, and originally from that old stock, who about 3000 B.C., had poured down upon Northern India, chanting Vedik hymns before the Sanskrit of the Vedas existed, though not before the primary Aryan words for father, mother, brother, god, &c., had been settled between those going south and those going west. The travellers to Gaul, Alba, and Ire-inis had clearly traversed Greece or its neighbourhood before the traditionary days of Palamedes, for they knew nothing of Xi, Theta, Phi, Chi, or the still later Zeta, Eta, Psi and Omega of Simonides. They had long prior to Kadmos, passed by with a regularly formed alphabet, suited to thewants of their older Keltic tongue. It was A, B, C (K), D, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, H or Uath the aspirate, to which the first Christians of Ire added the unsolicited and among Kelts, the scarcely yet adopted letters, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z. Indeed, even in 1602, King James found it necessary in order that the Kelts might read the bible, to direct that it be printed only in the old Irish. Many Irishmen still prefer their d, bh and mh, to J, V, and Y, though some of these are admitted to be an improvement,2 and no language needs improvement more. Dorik Greek has been called Dorikized Keltik, and all the Latin races acknow-ledged the ubiquity of tho Skutho-Keltik tongues, nor seriously challenged their great age as written languages. Even Strabo, as already poiuted out, did not cavil at if he did not accept the statement of the Kelto-Iberian Turtedana, who averred that their laws had been written in verse some thousands of years before his time;3 and learned readers will recall much in evidence of their science and learning, if not literature, long before Greece rose to eminence. The Gauls and Birtons of the time of Tacitus clearly looked to Albion and Ire as the headquarters of their faith and literature. There only could the pious and literary be secure from the continual wars and turmoil of the great continent; and when Suetonius commenced roasting live Druids in Anglesey it is evident that the leaders fled still further west, as into Ireland and Kal-e-dunia and their islets. By the reign of Tiberius, says Pliny, Druids were totally extirpated from all Roman provinces,4 and then arose Latin, Saxon and Teutonik speech, which 1 Toland’s Druids, where Hebrew is stated to have had then 22 letters. 2 Toland’s Druids, p. 401; Cesar, vi. 13. 3 Q and K were useless.

Thus Western Europe proved the grave, and Ireland with its isles the ne plus ultra of the world-wide wanderers; but if the grave, then Ireland became the resting-place of all the literature and traditionary lore of the race, that is, of all they were able to conceal and carry with them to this quiet island home. It is to this fact we probably owe, as Toland’s Editor argues, the confusion and often incomprehensible and extravagant Irish histories, which for many ages we have been asked to credit.1 The lrish, he thinks, have availed themselves of records to which they have no claim, but which pertain to Keltik tribes of divers early migrations. Thus it may have been an earlier tribe, and not the Fir Bolgs, or Vir Belgæ, who arrived in 1500 B.C., or this may be the date when the latter set out on their travels. The Fir BoIgs are thought2 by Sir Wells Wilde to have been the Irish whose bodies have been found buried at full length in stone sepulchres under huge monoliths and earth mounds, with flint weapons and shell ornaments; and to have therefore been a pre-metalik people, and very different to Asiatik Skyths, who burned their dead. This author describes the Fir Bolgs as an in-ferior, darkish, long-headed race, such as is seen on Etruskan pottery, and unlike the Cornwall Kelts, who burned the body and buried the ashes under tumuli, or great menhirs, as in Cornwall. The Fir Bolgs are thought by many to have been a Turanian people of the Etruskan type—probably a Kushite tribe and the Ogham writers, for stones bearing oghams are frequent in Ireland, and absent from Comwall.3 The Danāan Irish who followed them were, Sir W. Wilde says, a round-headed race, “an intellectual refined specimen of the finest Caucasian,” and using metal; but indeed both races had metal at the famous battle of Moytura, and both races, be they Turanian or Aryan, exhibited their faith alike by worshipping stones, in circles, cromlechs, &c. But all the world even yet bears witness to the fact that Aryans, Shemites, and Turanians were alike in this respect. The steppes of high Asia and Central India, the rolling sands of Nedj, the wilderness of Moab, and smiling vales of Etruria, all proclaim the same tale, though tribal tastes differed. We know that Etrurians preferred cells and round towers, whilst Sardinians would only have Nurhags. Armorika loved Karns, great in number and size; Cornwall, its St. Michael or M’K’el-like mounts, “giants,” “rollers,” and “pipers;” whilst in Moab, says Canon Tristram, three Shemitik tribes chose each one symbol, a karn, a circle, or a dolmen; and out of “a great abundance of these primeval monnments,” he only once found them conjoined, and then it was a karn surrounded by a circle of dolmens,4 which accounts for Irish towers, Raths, cells, &c., of different ages and styles, and with any amount of varying myths and legends attached, but alas! no reliable history. This last is uuually indeed with ancient Bards and bedes, a vanishing quantity; whilst myths and legends go on in an ever-increasing series; and this is a constant rule to be borne in mind by the student of Faiths. 1 Toland’s Druids, p. 403. 2 Ireland, Past and Present. 3 Journal Anthrop.

We only hesitate when asked to confirm particular dates, as that the Fir Bolgs arrived in 1350. and Danāan in 1250, not feeling that there is sufficient and genuine enough evidence. These dates however seem most reasonable. Ptolemy says the Damnu had territories reaching from Galloway to the Tay, whilst Ireland urges that they came from Alba or Scotland, as most Eastern migrations would naturally do. They settled down after figbting the Vir Belgæ, and became known as the Tuath de Danāns or “tribe of Danāans,” but there were earlier and later immigrants, as those led by Partholanus and Nemedius—Latinized names; and Iberian Kelts under Simon Breac; of which more elsewhere. The varied literature or histories of these which each tribe would collect or invent, and which bards and ballads would carry forward, must certainly have added greatly to the confusion complained of in Irish chronologies and histories. But let us consider where and how Irish and other ancient Druidik re-cords probably got mixed together? The whereabouts would be at Taragh, Teamhuir or Tara, for this became the centre of Keltik, or at least Druidik learning, and possibly the principal royal residence about 800 B.C. Cesar points to Britain, of which Ireland was thought to be a part, as the headquarters of the faith in the estimation of the Continental Druids. They looked to it as the Catholic looks to Rome; and seven hudred to one thousand years is a reasonable enough period for the establishing of such a seat of Faith, and for its gaining the confidence of half a Continent. Yet Ireland must necessarily have been the last land which people travelling westward would reach, and not to it but to Spain, Gaul and the European coast generally, would the oldest histories properly belong. Yet none of any value have reached us from the Continent, and the thought arises that if these reached Ireland, and were there de-posited for safety, then Irish bards and antiquaries would probably freely adapt them to enhance the age and fame of their own country. With the exception of Armorika, no doubt Ireland, Wales and Kal-e-dunia, retained Druidism far longer than any part of the Continent, and more steadily than any. On the Continent there were constant wars, and more or less always a movement westward, which unsettled the tribes, and disturbed the restfulness ever necessary to study and writing, especially on religious and moral subjects. And thus literature possibly did not spring up until the races found themselves in this ne plus ultra island home, with none to quarrel with but themselves.. It was natural that the busy masses in Belgium, Gaul, &c., should therefore look to Britain, and finally to Ireland, for its learning, rites, rules and discipline, and that on being barbarously treated and so driven seawards by the Legions, they should, as a last resource, seek asylum there; and Irish history seems to confirm this, for in the time of Cesar we learn that “King Concovar of Tarnh was perplexed by a revolution,” evidently due, thinks the editor of Toland, to a great influx of foreigners. Druids and their dependants thus swamped the local establishments, and refused to observe the customs and laws of Tara, and objected to Irish or local compilations and to Irish Bardik liternture; probably they preferred their own and had much of it.

The king, with the view of satisfying all parties, then directed. a new and more distinct compilation of the laws, and a revision of all the traditionary writings of the antiquaries and bards, which however, did not quite satisfy the foreigners, and increased the discontent of his own more conservative subjects. Nevertheles, revisions and writing had to go on, and eventually it became a special tri-annnal duty of the Tara assembly, to revise and authorize these Druidik histories and codes. From these—where to be had—we are still awaiting light, but let us meanwhile describe, so far as we can, some features of Druidism and the rise of Christianity. Greeks, forgetful or ignorant that their nation and language of the classic period could not compare in antiquity with those of Skuths and Kelts, derived Druid from the Greek Drus or Drys, the oak, or rather “a tree,” which is its radical meaning in Greek, just as Saxons might say that Dry comes from their words Dree or tree. As the king of trees—nature’s most revered objects—the oak was called Zeus and Toth in the south, and Teus, Tys, Theuth, Thor, &c., in the north; but these terms applied rather to its great stem, which was looked upon as a natural Pillar or symbolic Karn, and worshipped by all Kar-neachs, more especially if cut, as was often done in its karned or horned form, as shown on page 64 of Volume I. The universality of the Keltik race and faith—varied though the latter was—becomes very apparent from the study of old names, as of towns, rivers, hills, &c.; for just as our present emigrant carries with him to his new home in the antipodes or the Americas, the names he loved in his native land, so did the ancient Kelt or Skythian. It is therefore a fair conclusion to draw, that where Gaelik names are, there have Gaels of Kelts been. This is most marked in words connected with religion, as the sacred Karn, tree, circle, stone, well, and “High God” Al, Alt, Art, &c.—See tables, pp. 285. 321, and 338-340. We may note in margin some very similar, yet geographi-cally, widely separated words, and this our glossary will bring out in fuller and stronger contrast. Note also that the god, shrine or holy place and the priest, are so closely allied in all these old faiths as to be scarcely distinguishable. If the godly symbol is the Dryi or Drui—the stem or horn of the sacred tree—-the priest is the Druid; if the Karn, horn, or obelisk, then the priest and his followers, are the Karn-achs, and Karneachs. So Greeks called the priests and seers of Arkanania or A-karn-ia, Karni;1 and Latins said that the worshippers of Sol or Sal were Salii, just as priests of Bel, were Beli or Balim, and as the Quiris or spear-god of the Quirinal had Curii or Cures—our curates, to attend upon him. Students of Keltik lore will observe that there is a strange connection between the “Shining God,” “Light,” and the Tree, and the same is true in Indian languages.

Our glos-sary under Sun, Surya, and I-al, Al, &c., will give much information on these matters. As the Sun-god is the circle of the heavens, so Al, Alt, Ulla, &c., are identified with his earthly circle of prayer and sacrifice. In Ross-shire there is still an Ulla-pool, (Gallice, Ulla-Poll) or circle of devotion, and the learned Kelt who mentions this, says that from Alla comes all our names for Hala or Holly woods,2 as at first adjoin-ing the Ala or Circle-god, in whose groves all rites and worship were observed. We probably see here the origin not only of Eul, Huil, or Seul, but of Eli or Heli, and hence of such names as Heli-o-polis, the circle down or centre of Eli or Ali worshippers, that is, where Hellenes or ON-ists clustered round the Polos, Pole, sign or “Circle” of their deity. The Dorians called Apollo, whom Greeks confess was a foreign god, Apellon, and there is no doubt that he was the old Keltik Ab-Elleo, Ab-alla, or Ap ala the “High-father,” Grekized into Ap-Elio, “descendant of the Sun,” which confirms the statement that Helios is from the Keltik. Europe and Western Asia are replete with names showing the intense worship of the Karnean Apollo, usually translated “the horned,” but which should rather be the “Apollo of the Karn.” I give here a few names which clearly refer to him. He was closely connected with all Augurian decrees, and Ovid relates that Karnia or Kardinia, presided over human vitals,3 by the mysterious and serpent-like folds of which, the Augurs thought they could read the decrees of the gods. Kelts called him “the hairy god,” Greannach, which Greeks and Romans repeated in various expressions, as Apollo Intonsus, Sul-Minerva, &c., although they seem to mean by these, the midsummer god, rather than the more probably Keltik signification as to his being “the long slanting-rayed god” of the early year. Greeks as well as Klets worshipped the kirn or karn god by singing and dancing around his karn, stone, or circle (kirning it or churning it, as the Skoti said), and then they feasted. Spartans used to chaunt his Karnean hymns or Karneioi nomoi, as they moved around the sacred Kuklos to the measured tread prescribed by the Karneatai, his chosen ministers, and then and there too, as in Innis Fail, did they light up his Bel-fires or Bel-teines; for he was the young Bel-god who rose to power in the Eotre or Easter, when it was the duty of every Karnoach to re-light his household fire from the Karnean’s 1 Jour.

They called the 10th of March or there-abouts, his “New Year,” and the 21st of June his mid-life; when again the Bel-teines blazed on every sacred hill and mount from Western Asia to the green Isle of Ire, which we too call Milesia, as Greeks called Akarn-ania, Miletus, and said all Meliti were aborigines. The Gauls or Karn-utes relighted all their fires every 31st October, or after harvest. Irish Kelts would readily translate1 A-karn-ania as Ach-or A’karnia, “the field or place of karns,” or the karn hill, and this is the real meaning of the Morbihan “Karnak.” Al or Alt was the ithy-phalik symbol of Bel, Be-al or Be-ala-n, “the one mighty to save,” or “the Hindoo strong one,” Bala or Bhala. The Ba-al Samam of Phenicians and Hebrews is also a good Keltik name for the sun, which Gaels still call Sam or Saman, as Himy- arites called it San, Saba or Sa-aba, etc. His holy fires says Toland, must always be lighted within sight of each other, and this ruled in Gaul as well as in Ireland. Stern, steadfast and deeply rooted in all early races, was the wondrous tree or grove faith. The groves of Turanian and Phenician Dodona, and the more truly Hel-lenik shrine of Saronides (oak groves), had so entwined themselves round the Greek heart, that even in the days of St. Columba no Greeks spoke lightly of them; and still, in this Nineteenth Century, no Christian priests, or all the power of imperially led Christianity, dare defile the sacred groves of the Eastem World. Even the rude un-lettered grove-priests and wild Keltik “Children of the Karns” found no difficulty in withstanding imperial Rome and her legions, for four hundred years; nor yet all the power and most subtle efforts of Christianity for more than twice as long, The old faith, in fact, was becoming exhausted, and succumbed for the same good reasons as we urged in the case of its southern form at Dodona and Delphi.2 Light and knowledge were becoming too strong for it; yet up to the fifteenth century, Highlanders used to assemble in crowds both for worship, and the observance of many old solo-phalik and fire rites, at Karns, Klachans or sacred stones; and up to the seventeenth century they used to bring their babes there, to be sprinkled and sanctified. On these occasions, cattle were occasionally sacrificed and libations of divers kinds poured out upon the Beth-Els. These solemn services were even then indistinguishable from those of Druidism, and not yet, says that accurate author Jacob Grimm, had the Irman-sul (pyramidal Her-mes), and dances round the sacred self-planted tree, ceased among his countrymen3—these Ali-mans, the once fervent adorers of the divinity Alx, Alc, or Alh, in all respects the ancient Al of Syria and Arabia, and the Alt of Kale-duns. The Teuton Alah is described by Grimm as “a rock or stone,” and an emblem “which bestowed fertility,” and such “idols” Christians continued for ages to build into their church walls. Even at this day they sacrifice to them in preference “to going near the Christian altar”; and, continues Grimm, they build churches, especially to St. Peter the Petros over the old Petrine “blue-stone” god; for in Germany as in the Scottish Highlands, this 1 Toland’s Druids, pp. 118, 376. 2 Vol. i., p. 267. 3 Teutonic Myth., i. 73, 106, 7, 8, 115, and see our Glossary.

Forbes Leslie wrote, that in the holy Chapel of St Fladda, north-east of Skye, dedicated to St. Columba, the people up to the seventeenth century had great faith in, and continued to adore their famous “round blue stone” of sanatory and mira-culous powers; and we have elsewhere pointed out similar superstitions continuing down to one hundred years ago, and said that only within the seventeenth century did the masses begin really to understand that which we now call Christianity. A leading bishop of the English Church lately announced, in his annual charge to his clergy, that the visitation duty of a bishop of the sixteenth century was, not to see to the education. of his flock, for they had none, but that the clergy or shepherds “could repeat the Lord’s prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments”—truly a wondrous advance in the faith after a thousand years of teaching. Is it wonderful, as man is said to be a religious animal, that the more the sites of churches are closely investigated. the more we come upon tales regarding sacred stones, trees, wells and strange cells? That great and forcible pro-moter of Christianity, Charlemagne, is indissolubly and strangely connected with such matters and stone charms. He built a church over the nest of a serpent near Zurich. which visited his bell-tower, and presented to it a sacred stone, and to this stone he and his queen were much attached all their lives; and the founding of Aix-la-Chapelle is said to be due to the fact that this stone was thrown into the hot spring there, and could never again be recovered.1 The monastery church of Altmark is due to the rever-ence with which the stem of a “sacred Drus or Oak” was regarded. It is indeed built into the altar,2 and is considered the gem and treasure of all the neighbourhood, and some say, because it befriended a hunter pursued by a stag. It more probably represented a Nimrud too fond of pursuing maiden Dianas. If the state of the sheep was such as represented by our bishops a thousand years after the miracle-working Saint Columba and his followers were said to have converted most of Western Scotland, what were shepherds and flocks in those days when eccle-siastical writers aver that our forefathers all became Christians? Let us interview the ancient Archbishop of Iona, and try to understand him. Columba out-Druided Druids. Like his masters, he raised the dead, controlled the winds and the waves, turned water into wine, and caused fountains to flow from dry rocks, whilst his prayers brought victories to kings, and his maledictions, confusion to the king’s enemies, and this in a manner which would have made many existing kings and peoples believe that their god had answered their urgent prayers for victory. The Keltik saint in the plentitude of his power, perhaps, “to heap coals of fire” upon an enemy’s head, cured the great infidel magician Broichan, prophesied like the Jewish seers of old, held constant communication with angels, and freely cast out devils directly by his word of command, or as was common with the early saints, by signs, crossers, croziers, candles, and the ringing of holy bells. Bells indeed, became as with Sivaites, a most important agency of the Holy Ghost, to drive away all other ghosts. 1 Conway’s Demonology, ii. 397.  2 Ibid., p. 374."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 366The Kale-duns were taught to consecrate, baptize and adorn these Eastern mystik em-blems (carving them no doubt like that of Saint Phālan’s shown on p. 300), and by ringing them to warn off all evil from persons, houses, or land. No old Eastern rites or procedure seem to have been neglected by these Skuthi, whether Irenes Skoti or Picts. The life of Columba, as given to us by Adaman the ninth abbot of Iona, is one long scene of strange and absurd miracles, yet even these are valuable as unconsciously giving us a correct notion of the dense credulity and superstitions of all Skoti up to at least the seventh century. We see that the so-called change of faiths, was but a change of superstitions,1 and that Christians fell readily into the old ways, adopting the existing paraphernalia. and shrines, and putting their new Passion Spiel upon the boards with very much the same scenic accompaniments. Iona, Skye, Mure, Arran, and numerous other islets on the lochs and shores of Irene and Alba, were found to have most suitable shrines, which Palladius, the Patriks and St. Columba adopted, as their fathers had done ages before they were heard of. There were numerous mounds like that of Tara and Skone, which Druids and Christian bishops alike accepted, con-secrated and prayed upon, also stone circles called Klachans, where all assembled for worship, as our Highlanders still do at Klachans. Some of these had Phalik towers, which the new faith called is Clohhans or Belfreys—a distinction the Sivaites of Benares would say, without a difference, and more especially when surrounded with many other characteristics of the old Nature worship. The Island of Mull grouped its towers in a similar manner to that of the Sardinian Nurhags, and Scotland had many other shrines such as we are familiar with in Asia. Although Romans regarded these Nurhags with wonder, yet they were not unfamiliar objects to Skuths and Skands. Great was the zeal of the new faith in founding cells, kills or chapels on or amidst the ruins of the revered departed, and as the age of writing advanced, much literary skill and diligence were evinced in many religious houses among the Albans of Scotland, and Skoti of Ireland. In the writings of the monastery of Durrow, which claimed Columba as its founder in 553, the Saint is called the author of its famous emblazoned Book of Kells, or book of Durrow; he is also said to have written out the four gospels in the Latin Vulgate, and the Latin Psalter or “The Catach or Battler,” which was to lead the now embattled hosts of “the peace on earth and good will to men” faith. With sword and sacred text, cross and candle, fetishes and charms, the new faith was now to take Israel of old as their guide and go forth utterly to extirpate the enemies of their Yahue. Let us look at the first great leader of the warfare. He is indeed no unreal or mythological being, though his historian does his best to make him such, for he envelops him in an absurd tissue of legend and miracle, which, as Dr. Reeves says, “often bids defiance to truth, reason, and decency.”2 But there is no reason- 1 See all the invaluable vols. of the Historians of Scotland. 2 Adaman’s Life, p. 2.

It is said that Colum, Colman or Columba was a common enough name among the Skoti or Irish of those days, yet announced as it is by the superstitious historian with some empressement, is the same name as Jonah, the Hebrew Iona, the Greek Peristera, and the Latin Columba, it suggests that this was a sacred name given mythically or to cover some idea of the “Spirit of God” or Holy Ghost—“the Dove,” which from the Iona or Dove-Isle, spread abroud the new faith. Alter sundry raids, the now celebate priest, aged forty-two and known as Colum Kille or “Colum of the Church,” established himself at Hy or Iou, (pronounced Yo), under the protection of his own Scotish King but apparently with the consent of the Kal-e-duns, whose king Conal, is said to have been Columba’s cousin. This was in 563 or sixty-one years before his historian Adaman was born. He too was a Dalriadian Skot or Scaoth of Donegal, and proceeded to the abbotship of Iona as the ninth from St. Colum, in 679, by which time the Saint had been eighty-two years dead; and legend and tradition had thus been busy for about a hundred years before the so-called historian finished, or perhaps entered upon his labours. The Historians of Scotland indeed, even write that they are not sure that this “history of Adaman’s is the genuine work of the famous ninth Abott”! and that “splendid as the fame of Iona was, yet the very names of all its literary men have perished.”1 One thing is however certain regarding the first Saint, viz. that his whole life was inextricably mixed up with the worship of all things now called Phalik, as with red, blue and white sacred stones (the Krishnaik and Sivaik forms), with sacred mounts and Round towers, crucifixes, rods, croziers, banners, their standards and other magic staffs, reliquaries, and holy garments or even shreds of what the saints wore. It was customary to worship these things, and to swear oaths upon them, which Jacob Grimm says, meant in those days,2 “adoration,” and this adoration continuned down to a very late period. Tara, for which Columba fought, had then its Jupiter Fœderis, and many of the holy islands of Westem Ireland claimed similar significant symbols. Skye, or Fladachuan, hastened to dedicate its “ever moist and incomparable blue ovicular stone” and its holy Chapel, to “St. Columba,” whilst Manx men dedicated Lingams and Towers to their mythical Orry, clearly Or or T’Or.3 Very strange indeed, the stories regarding “the virtues” of, and the reverence paid by the Saint and all his following, to his “natal stone”—a Cloch ruadh or “Red Stone,” or as others name it,”St. Colum’s blue stone of Glen-Colum-Kille.” This lingam even played a part in the Donegal Inquisition of 1609, for Columba had 1 Preface to Vol. VI. 2 Teut.

Near his house at Kells also was, and still is, a linga-like stone, six feet by about a foot square, which is called Col-umba’s Nuda petra. It too worked miracles, and is now known as the Saint’s penitential bed, and bed-stones are most important articles in phalik lore. It is noteworthy that Columba’s father bore the Lingaish name of Fidh-li-Midh, and that tho Saint’s birth and death took place on a sacred stone; nay, his very life as well as the lives of his fellow monks were miraculously sustained by their meal-sack in the Iona Monasteryt because it stood on the holy stone Moel-blatha, thus making it a true Bethel or God of Beth-lechem (bread), for it thus fulfilled the part Yahue and his prophet played, in the case of the widow’s cruse of oil.1 St. Columba was tonsured, according to the custom of his day at the back of the head, and he was buried like the rest of the monks at Iona, but about one hundred years afterwards, or in 700 A.D., he was disinterred, and in 824, enshrined. Unhistorical, nay false though the life of the Saint may be, it is indeed most useful in so clearly showing us the rude credulity of the age, as well as the strange rites, customs and traditions which then existed in this so little known, but very important period of our history. It was then that the old KaIedunians and Picts received their first real faith-shock, which quickened them in to life and learning. Though Ire and Alba were clearly peopled by the same race, yet “the swarm” or Skā-oths which we call the Skoti—apparently the latest to arrive, were the first to start upon a career of conquest and of literary life, neither of which paths seem to have been character-istic of the dreamy Alban Gaels or Ersh (Irish), as they call themselves. Iona had heard doctrines which sundry Phadriks and Southern missionaries had failed to propagate in the stern North, but which their Irish cousins, these Dalriadian Skoti, were now enabled to slowly impart; yet very slowly indeed, for these Albans were a fierce and bigoted people, whom neither Ninian, Paladius nor the Patriks, though Britons (Patrik was born in Dun-briton or Dumbarton), could circumvent. When, however, the Albans heard the current reports of the fourth and fifth centuries, that sundry holy places like Tara, Kells and Cashel had spoken favourably with the new priests, then Kale-duns were inclined to listen, and although the Pictish king shut his own palace gates, yet he allowed “the Dove” to perch upon the rocks of Iyo, and doves to fly back and forward, unmolested by him, from Alban islets to their Irish nests, as they were ever and again driven from their perches by the bold and restless Danes and other Norse Pagans. According to most “Scottish Historians” the Picts and Scots or Kaleduns and Gaels or Gao(dh)als or the Kelto-Skuthi of Ireland, were but different emigrations of the same Asiatik stock, either directly from the East, or as most think in the case of the Skoti, through Keltik, yet decended from Fiene Fana, the Milesian Fen or Phenician. 1 Adaman, pp. 96, 98, 99, 224, 241. 1 Kings xviii."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Columba and the Dalriadan Skoti and their Worship. 369The sub-name Dalriadans, seems only to have belonged to the first Alban Skoti, because in the middle of the second century A.C., their king or chief who first managed to establish the tribe on the west coast of Argyleshire, was called Carbera, or Eocha Riada or Riede, the Reuda of Bede, who called the Skoti, Dal-reudini. The country they occupied was early known as the Regiones Dal-rietæ, and the Kale-duns or Picts acknowledged it up to the union, as the Regnum Dalrietæ.1 They had then been long assisted by the Dalrietæ against intruding Romans, Britons, Saxons and others, and are identified in history with them under the term “Scots and Picts, two fierce peoples.” In 360 it is stated that these ravaged the Romo-British or lowland coun-tries ruled over by the Emperor Constantine. According to Fordun it was about a generation after this, say 400 A.C., or accord-ing to others 350, that Fergusson of Etch (some say the second of the race but first of Scotland), brought over the sacred Tara (afterwards the Argyle and Skone) Stone of the tribes, and finally established the Skoti or Irishery as a nation, on the island of the Kaleduns. This was accomplished not by force, says Dr. Kennedy—an old writer upon “the ancient writers,” but by “Riada so ingratiating himself with the Picts, and doing such good service against the Britons, that the Picts consented they and their followers should continue among them.” They, however, evidently at times tried to oust the Skoti, but found them too persistent if not strong, for in 386 the Irish king of these Hiberni, one Niel, appears to have crossed over to the Argyleshire coast with so powerful a force, that all the Picts were finally driven out of “Cantyre and Argyle, and the Dalriadys alone suffered to inhabit that side of the country.”2 These Skoti were, says Guilders, called Irishery down even into the fourteenth century.3 It is not likely that King Fergus ever heard of Palladius the first Christian mis-sionary to the Lowlands, as we know for certain that he was only ordained by Pope Celestine in 431, and then sent to convert the Skots of Ireland; although as Father Innes contends, it by no means follows that an attempt had not by this time been made towards converting some Alban Skots dwelling among the Lowlanders, on many of whom the preaching of Ninian, Palladius and Patrik had doubtless taken effect. This is mere ecclesiastia conjecture however; it is more probable that the Skots were rejoicing over their famous stones in Iona and Skye, as Picts were steadily worship-ing these in mounds and Klāchans (stone shrines), from the lowlands of Galloway to all over trans-Grampian Kale-dunia. We must now try to put briefly before the reader some of the much-bungled and very long stories, of thesc our very ancient fore-fathers, and fortunately there is no uncertainty as to the main facts, though it takes much wearisome study to arrive at these. The name of Picts, it has been said, was given to the northern Alban race, the Kale-duns or “Hill Gaels,” by the Romans, from their painting or “picturing” their 1 History of Scotland viii.; Innes’ Essay, 347.

In Ireland the Picts were the Cruitneachs or Cruithne, from Cruith, “a mark, form or figure;” yet this too is the name of their first Irish king, the son of Kinne or Cinge, and father of the Irish Pictish king who flourished 300 years B.C. The Welsh and Saxons called the people Phychts, Pehts or Phytas; but, however this may be, the name says Innes,1 as “the painting or painted people” was once common to all Britons, and simply stuck longest he thinks to these northems, becauce they were never as a homogeneous people conquered or civilized by Roman, Briton or Saxon. Ever and again they were driven beyond the wall which joined the “Friths of Clud and Forth,” but not further; and rarely could the Legions long restrain their persistent patriotism and impetuosity, even on that far southern Roman rampart joining the Eden water with the Tyne, where it looked down on the smiling meads of fair Eng-land. Lowland Skots and Saxons, or rather those Lowlanders called Meatach, and whom Romans ignorantly called the Meatæ (meaning Mid-Britons who by aid of the Legions and Roman skill, disputed with the Gaels their fertile fields and pastures of Galloway and Louthia, as they designated their Lowlands between Dun-breton or Dumbarton and the Solway),—these lowland tribes had hard times, or as they would say, “short thrift” with the Kale-duns, till civilization and like faith accorded to them the right hand of fellowship. This was not however till the ninth century, when the Alban king, Kenneth MacAlpine was accepted as the king of both Picts and Skots. Southern immigrations then became too strong for even Gaelish exclusiveness, and in two centuries more, the Pictish language and people were lost, not destroyed, but fused into Scotch and Anglo-Saxons. Let us try to see distinctly who these Pictish Gaels or Kale-duns were, and what part they played in history. THE PICTS.—This people withstood Roman and all invaders as far north as Sterling till the seventh century A.C.; but the little colony of Hiberni Skoti or Scaoth-Eri-nachs, whom they had permitted to settle on some outlying portions of Argyleshire in the middle of the third century A.C., had by the middle of the sixth century so firmly established themselves there, increased and become useful, that the Picts then acknowledged them as an independent nation of Dalriadik Skots. The Christian leaders of these, after years of active missionary labours, converted it is said the Pictish King or Bruido-Acupunctus, named Celtrain, and he died a Christian. All these races were undoubtedly from the Skythian hive, that central Asiatik “workhouse of nations,” which ever and again swarmed westward from Asia. We are told by Keltik scholars that the name Skot is only indirectly Skuth or Skyth, and that all Kelts, Irish and Picts would naturally call their invades Skots or Scaoths, from this Gaelik word which signifies “a swarm or colony,” that is, filobusters, which also is the probably origin of the world-wide word Skythians, whom all people knew as rovers—a term Skotchmen have not belied. Some have urged that both the words Skot 1 Hist. of Scot., viii., p. 53, &c.

This would acoount also for the occurrence of the many tales common to Egyptian and Jewish histories, concerning temples, Arks, Noahs, floods, holy stones, &c., which we find throughout Keltik histories. The Syrian or more southern portion of the great overflow, tried as we know from Eastern stories, to settle in Asia Minor, Egypt, and indeed all over eastern Europe, and they probably did so to some extent. We have correct history recording their names, very much as shown by red lines in our map, Plate II., at the beginning of this volume. Of course they were not by a long way the first Skuthik or Asiatik horde which came to impress its character and faith on Europe, and which first reached Alba and Irene;2 yet if Picts were not of this sixth century wave, they must have belonged to the earlier cyclic period of about 1200 B.C., when Aryans were again much moved all over the world, as the broad bands across our large chart are intended to show. Judging from many traits in the character of the Kaleduns, it seems most pro-bable that they inherited their known taste for sculpturings and florid delineations, and ballad or poetic tastes, through amalgamation in blood with the earlier building races of Kuths, Skuths or Aithiops, who had long previously placed towers, pyramids, karns and circles, over half the world. Bede, writing about 720, says that the Kale-duns or Picts had a written language which the Lowland Britons, Saxons, and Skoti could not read, and that when he wrote, their king was keenly intent on church ornamentation, and in the gathering together of all kinds of Ritual observances; that he had made Iona the headquarters of Pictish faith, where he had a great body of busy scribes and Ritualists, intent on illuminating sacred subjects and writings. Many consider this people the authors of the art which culminated in the florid decorations of the Books of Kells, Dimma, etc., and point in corroboration to the beautiful tracery, strange animals and drolleries on their sacred stones, found throughout Pictish Alba. They were a far more advanced people than the nomadik Irish Kelts, who down even to 1600 could not build a decent house, but wandered about like homeless Kalmuks herding cattle. In Ulster “there was not one house, but only ‘Herds or Creaghts,’ ” yet antiquaries3 see in the Pictish stone tracery work of the same character as the Etruskan freskos, whilst their mirror and comb ornaments betoken acquaintance with Babylon and the Nile, and 1 Innes’ Essay, pp. 51-55. 2 The ancient names of Ireland were: Iernis = Ir-innis, Ile of the West; Irene, Eirin, Iarin, Juver-nis, Hibernia.

The so-called Keltik “cup or disk ornament,” with central dot, we have in Benares and on the rocks of Kamāon, where it is known as a solo-phalik symbol of treble significance, representing at once sun Sun as the Great Fertilizer, the glans as seen in plan, and Maya’s breasts; whilst “the spectacle sculp-ture,” seems to mean the testes, more especially when shown filled with seeds or suns. This and the other ob-jects here given will be found treated of at p. 201 of my first volume. In regard to the uniform and rude character of Pictish and similar ancient figures, it must be borne in mind that in all faiths, no drafmmen are permitted to depart from the traditional style. Pictures were the sacred books of the people, and every line and dot were well considered, and estab-lished by Druids, Magi or other priests, and a strict formula required the conventional mode of delineation, to be rigidly adhered to. “No improvements were admitted; no attempts to copy nature or to give proper action to the limbs. . . . The faulty conceptions of early times were copied and perpetuated,” say our best writers;1 and we know the same rule has ever obtained in India. The Picts buried their dead in round barrows, and fought with short spears and daggers, of which the long claymore and belt dagger of our Highland costume, are the present representatives. Some argue that the Fir or Vir-Bolgs, were “Men of the Quiver,”2 sprung from the Picts, thus bridging over the gap between Kaleduns and the Skoti, a dolicho-kephalus, or round-headed, dark-eyed race, of which very decided traces yet remain. The Skoti were a tallish, ruddy-haired race, equally valient but more energetic and aggressive than the Picts; and in the admixture of the two, as Gaels, Gaedheals, Gwyddili, Ffichti, Cels, Cals, Gælli or Gals, we may find the origin of Kaledunians, and all things Gaelik and esteemed divine. Sacred mounds were termed Gals in Keltik, as well as in Syrian wildernesses; and omitting the silent or nasal g, we have the Keltik God of Mounts in Al, Alt, Art, Adh, &c. Attention has been called to the revered Keltik terms Ge-all, “a vow,” and Gea-liach or lia, “the stone of the vow, and to the “Ardi or holy place of adoration or vows.”3 In time the Ark or holy place would give its name to its votaries, and hence, Gael would 1 Sir Jas.

Similarly Arians were followers of As, Is, Ar, Ir or Ri,1 and their country would be As-ia, Ar-ia or Ar-ania, or Ir-ne or Iran. Kelts were possibly K-Els or K-Alts, from their “Great High God,” for Ka is a common but important honorific and phalik affix, which the reader will find fully discussed in various parts of these volumes and Glossary. A flint stone, banner and axe—all emblems of Siva—are called Celts, and in Welsh Celtt; but not from these could Greeks and Latins have got the early known name of Keltæ, a people they probably first heard of through the writings of Hekataios the Abderite, as inhabiting a mythical terra borealise incognita. The language of the Picts was a mixture of their own Gaelik with Irish, Keltik, Welsh and Kymrik and when they became Chris-tianized, with Latin and Saxon—the tongue of the Britons and Mœats or Mid-Britons, who interposed between Kaledunia and Roman Britain proper. These began to receive Christianity in the last half of the fourth century, when General Theodosius incorporated the Louthins and Galloway in one Roman Province—Valencia. Some allege that the fathers of Saints Ninian and Patrik were then converted, the former in Galloway, and the latter near Dun-breton or Dumbarton, and that “they did in the fifth age greatly increase the number of the faithful, who were, however, before 400 A.C. considerable”; but history does not substantiate this too favourable Christian estimate. The careful, and, where Christianity is not concerned, the accu-rate Father Thomas Innes, in his in valuable Essay, says the Saxons of the North were only “converted in the seventh age by Bishop Aydan and his successors,”2 and thus the venerable Bede was able to write, that in his time, Christianity was professed in Britain by races talking five different languages. Neither Picts nor Skots showed any kindliness to these Lowlanders of Clydesdale and Galloway until the seventh century, though a good deal to each other as Pagan cousins. In 756 the Britains, by whom may be understood the Welsh, etc., “were permitted to depart from Al-Clud or Dun-britton on certain conditions, which apparently the Picts had not hitherto granted.”3 We still however, find that a considerable number of Welsh remained up to the end of the ninth century, and some so long as the twelfth, by which time the masses had become a fusion of Picts, Skots, Danes, Angles and Saxons, resulting in our now tolerably homogeneous “Scotchman” or “Britisher,” of the United Kingdom—a very different creature to the pictured Kale-dun, or Briton of old Wales and Amorika, and a long way removed from him whom Greeks called the Kelto-Skuth, and who spoke, says Tacitus, “a Gallik tongue.” The Skoti of Bede were only known as a Scā-oth or Colony, in parte Pictorum, dwelling he says, along the Pictish coast of Argyleshire up “to the north bank of the Firth of Clud,” and among the southern or Deu-Kal-e-duns—a more civilised people 1 See Rita in Glossary [i.e., Faiths of Man], and cf.

"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 374than the Vecturiones or northern Picts.1 The venerable Bede was apparently not aware that the missionary filobusters of Columba had gradually grown into recognised independence, rather because they assisted the Picts in their southern wars, than as propagandists; though by the end of the seventh century these missionaries had made a great impression on the northerns, whilst the southerns had been then nearly all won over by the preaching of Ninian and his successors. It was in 560, says the historian of St. Colum-Kill, that the Pictish King or Brude, shut his gates in the face of his so-called cousin, perhaps because he and his fenow missionaries still continued to offer up prayers for their Hibernian Skotish King Aydan,2 instead of for the Brude and his ancestors, who had sp graciously allowed their settlement on Pictish territory. The Irish historian Nenius of 832 states that no one ever disputed the sovereignty of the Picts north of the Clud; nor when Rome abandoned the Meats or Mid-Britains—about 426—did any then dare to resist the Pictish rule, down even to as far south as the English Northumbrian wall. In the next generation however, or about 450, hosts of stalwart Saxons under a bold leader, Hengist, fought for all this land, and by 547 established there a Saxon kingdom under Ida, but without expelling the Kale-duns who ever and again rose, and finally in 685 under their king or Brude, recovered their country. Up to about 800 the Brudes of the Kale-duns are frequently foimd giving shelter to Northumbrian kings, when these were hard pressed by Saxons; but from this time —the ninth century, the Pictish kingdom gradually began to lose its individuality; by 1150 it had lost its language, and by 1300 was known only to the outside world as Scotland. Yet, says “Jo. Major,” in his Scotish History, King Robert Bruce told his soldiers at Bannockburn, that King Kenneth of the ninth century “possessed scarcely one third part of Scotland when he conquered the Picts,”3 and induced them and the Scots to then accept his united rule. Fordun is not very clear as to the commencement of the Pictish kingdom, but seems to think it rose about 300 B.C., whilst various other authorities incline to a somewhat earlier date; all however are agreed, that 850 A.C. is the period when Picts ceased as a nation per se,4 and merged into a mixture of many peoples. It will suffice for our purpose to know, that these Kelto-Skuths rose to power as an organised people in Ireland or Scotland, or in both to some extent, between 350and 500 B.C., and endured—furnishing by far tha greater part of the raw material on which is built up the political and religious life of Scotland—for about 1200 years. The Kale-duns were not destroyed, but fused with all the other elements of the popula-tions, from the time that Kenneth MacAlpine agreed to rule fairly over the 1 Historians of Scotland, viii. 62. 4 The Latin Chronicle, 375 B.C. + 850 A.C. = total, 1225 yrs.2 Ibid., p. 66. 3 Ibid., pp. 84, 96, 98.

Irish Bards and writers who follow them, say that the Pictish Monarchy began with King Herimon, son of Milesus of the eleventh, twelfth or even thirteenth cen-tury B.C., but the Picts of that period were no doubt an earlier swarm from the great Eastern Skuthik hive. There is no reason to discredit these dates altogether, for clearly these lands were then all peopled from the East ages before that, and men have acupted much more improbable matter from unknown writers. Where, however, the “Psalter of Cashell” and other Bardik writings give detailed stories like those in the Pentateuch, regarding an Adam, Flood, Ark, Noah, Moses or similar characters, we naturally think they are fabrications or imitations, just as we may so couclude, in the case of Pentateuchal stories, when we read the tablets of Babylon and Asyria. Indeed all detailed stories of a Genesis are most suspicious and to be discredited, though we willingly grant that not only were these islands, but probably all the world, peopled twice 2000 years B.C., and by races worshipping Nature Gods, or the stupendous and to them mysterious powers of nature, and all strange or prominent features which seem to bespeak unseen or spiritual forces. The reader must not wonder at our thus spending so much space, time and laborious research upon these ancient and somewhat unsatisfactory ethnical evolu-tions, for to establish the times and movements of a race, goes a long way towards locating a prevailing faith, its age and times of transition; nay, we are still pretty sure to do this, though we fall considerably short in geographical and chronological details, and although we deal with persons who seem only semi-mundane, provided the names and accessories have in their origin clearly to do with faiths, or are allegorically mixed up with the old Faiths. Thus Picta who came from Asiatik Skuthia several centuries B.C. and ruled supreme, as has been indubitably proved for ten or twelve centuries, must have carried with them, not only their old Gods but all their crude old ideas, fetishes and nature worship. Hence, as one would expect, we find in Scotland and Ireland the same general features and characteristics which distinguished Asiatik Skuths, Cushites, or Asiatiks generally; and when we learn that Loegaire of 427 to 470, was the first Irish Keltik King sprung from that Asiatik stock who, some aver, embraced Christianity, we are then so assured as we can be of any ancient history, that up to 450 or so, the religion of this people was their old Asiatik Nature worship, and that such must have continued the real religion of the masses for some three or four hundred years beyond that, as it takes some such period to make several millions of wild people understand a written and spiritual faith. this too, is a very moderate calculation, for many urge that not above half the people of these ilands can even now be called Christians; indeed, Christianity was for the first five hundred years very hardly pressed by those ilanders and adjoining Pagans; even Father Innes confesses that Christianity was almost extinguished in Scotland about the beginning "},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 376of the twelfth century.1 During all the Roman period, and on to the sixth century, the Irish people were only known, says Strabo, as infinitely wilder, more savage and barbarous, than all other Kelts, and more so than either their Gaulik or British brethren. The people, said Tacitus, “are ignorant of all virtues,” whilst their Government is so weak, and their chief is so rude and unlettered, that be would engage, he told Agricola, to conquer and subject the whole iland to Roman rule with a single legion.2 Thus the ancient learning, arts, and architecture, introduced by Kuths and Phenicians, had succumbed under the Keltik roces who succeeded them, and Christianity came very opportunely to stir up the people, and by its religious houses and book-faith, to create and foster reading and writing, which Druids had for long been discoun-tenancing, as tending to open up their mysteries and make all as learned as themselves. The Latin tongue too, gave the people a new voice, being adapted to rapid writing, which the old Irish never had been, and it came to them also through able teachers, and with all the improved appliances of a great literary nation. The far older language, the Irish, with its crude sixteen uncial-like letters, was too poor to adapt, and had probably only been used uncially, like the Greek of the times of Hekataios; so that Palladius and the various Patriks (for we know of four, and not one only), created a literary and glorious revolution in all the thoughts and govern-ment of the people, far beyond that which their new faith in itself was capable of effecting. The writings which existed at the head-quarters of provinces and shrines, as at Tara, Cashel, etc., were common enough to the Magi, Druids or literati, and there doubtless were found the “three hundred volumes” which the Christian Fathers thought it easier and beter to destroy than refute.3 Alas! the loss of all such matters has been incalculable, and confronts us more and more as we strive after the intellectual history of races whether in the East or West. It is now held by many as a fact, that the Royal Senate used to meet annually at Tara in the eighth, if not the tenth century B.C., and that a king, Eocha Olam Fodla, then had the past and current transactions of the Government and the religious affairs of the iland revived and recorded by a Committee, which sat every third year, and was composed of three Princes, three Druids, and three Bards.4 We know of no sufficient reason to discredit this, and may also grant that four great waves of peoples—“the Partholms or Bartholms, the Nemedi, the Clan-bols or Clan-bogs, and the Danāans”—at various times dominated the whole, or the best part of the country, long before even Olam Fodla of Tara. We are finding reasons, indeed, for the Bardik assertions, that Danāans and Fir-bolgs belong most probably to the great waves of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A.C. which buried or built Dr. Schlemann’s last Troy. Whether Aryans or Turanians, Pelasgians or Kelts, it is yet hard to say; if the latter, we find their debris in the Galatiana or Galatæ, Gaulti, or Khaltee—names they 1 Historians of Scotland, viii. p. 104. 2 Ibid., pp. 240-1. 3 Toland’s Druids; Historians of Scot., viii., 258. 4 Keating, London Edition, 1723, pp. 133-143.

Conquerors adopting old Gods and Priests. 377still retained in Gaul and elsewhere, and to which we owe, say some writers, our word Gaels and Kelts,1 and apparently the Kals of Kal-e-dunia. General Vallancey looked upon the Fir-bolgs as only a learned class like the Chaldees or Culdees of Babylon. Irene and Alba, deriving their names from Vir or Fir, man, and bolg or balg, “learning, eloquence or virtue.” Even if Bolg be taken as Belgæ, this word was also with Chaldees, says Castellus, “an order of Priests” (servers of Belus?); and the Chaldees of Greek days, were the Chusdim of Shemites, that is the offspring of their “Chus the eldest son of Ham,” whose posterity once ruled “all the lands of the two rivers,” and as Kuthas, Kuses or Skuths, a large portion of Asia. Westerns may have meade Chus into Chul, Cael, etc., for S and L are here permissible changes. We must urge in explanation of all this, a rough historic rule which has long forced itself upon us, viz., that old and supplanted races, generally attained among their new conquerors, the rank of teachers, and very soon became the priests, sorcerers, magi or “great ones,” of the rude wanderers or warriors who subdued them. Thus Shemitik Babylonians called the old Chusians or Chusdim or Chaldees, their priests and astro-logers,2 and Asyrians looked to the same sources for their teachers. So the Sabeans of Yemen, became the priests of many peoples, and the Tuskans were called the priests of the Pelasgi.4 Thus Danāans or others effacing Fir-bolgs, naturally when settling down on their old lands and shrines, looked upon the holy men whose people they dis-placed, as suitable sacred teachers, and their gods and rites as sufficing for them also. Gods used to be captured, not destroyed, till Arabian and Christian intolerance arose. Romans adopted all the old gods of their holy mounts, the Jove or Pallas of the Pala-tine, and the Quires of the Sabine Quirinal, not to mention the prophetic Sibyllæ of many old peoples, of whom the first was the daughter of their mythik ancestor, Dar-danus, of Trojan and Samothracian fame. These Dardans, after peopling half the coasts and islands of Asia Minor, Arakadia and Italy, probably passed westward, and may be the Dandans or Dan-ā-ans of Ireland. Ten countries and celebrated oracles, more especially Keltik, claimed the divine Sibyllæ as their instructresses, and Pythagoras thankfully received the teachings and mystik arrow of the Druid Abaris. Cesar acknowledged that all Druids had full belief in Rome’s “Immortal Gods,” and doubtless he worshipped these with them, as Alexander of Macedon had anointed Beth-Els, and bowed before all the gods, whose servants he overthrew. So in India we see Hindoos of every phaze of Brahmanism, yes, and Eastern Christians also, freely joining in the processions and fêtes of Boodhists and Mahomedans. Only so long as adjoining faiths are equally powerful, do they, like relations, quarrel badly, and call each other’s gods, devils. When jealousy is extinguished, and powers tolerably defined, the tendency is to amalgamate, and this was strong enough among illiterate 1 Cf.

Nor would the latter object to receive new gods or sacred old emblems which would enhance the popularity of their shrines. The Eastern Pala-diums of Danāans, and the celebrated holy stone which the Kelto-Iberian prince, Simon Breac brought from Spain, would be a welcome addition to the sacred emblems of Ireland, and we are certain that Spain, Armorika and Skandinavia, did freely contribute to all the faiths and legends, as well as to the population of Ireland. Father Innes and other historians make this quite clear, though when Romans were in Gaul and Britain, as from 50 B.C. to 420 A.C., the Irish immigrants would come principally from Spain and Wales, or from wherever most acutely persecuted. The Skoti, thinks Innes, came mostly from the Chersonesus Cymbrica, as Norway and Denmark were called,1 and from the Gallæci or Callaici of Spain, and thus would naturally be “Gaels”; but wherever from, they would carry with them, if possible, their sacred emblems, acting as Eneas, when he robbed the Troas, and Rebecca, when she stole the gods of her father Laban. Thus every country at one time abounded with Lingaik or Yonik sacred stones, and these were mostly much-travelled objects. That enshrined in the Kibla or Ark of Meka had been adored for four hundred years on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and the tablets of Babylon and Asyria tell us that Elam, Susa, Persepolis and the highest mountain shrines of Armenia, had to yield up their Pala-diums for the favourite temples of their conquerors, near their palaces on the banks of the two great rivers. These stones rendered the bringer and the nation immortal; at least so long as they retained the godly symbols, and these were the pride and glory of kings and peoples, and the temples in which they were enshrined necame the envy of all less favoured kingdoms. So we read that Ireland was to endure as long as the stone of Breae2 was at Tara, the Skoti so long as it remained with them in Argylshire, and Kale-donia be for ever independent, if its kings were crowned on its fragment at Skone. Milesians disputed with Skoti the honour of removing it to Tara—Themor, or Tea(mh)ra, and Irish with Skots as to its having ever left this; others aver that the Kale-duns, when fused into a mythically-degraded stock, allowed the Anglo-Saxon to surreptitiously make away with it to his Abbey of Westminster. The stone before which the Roman Emperor Heliogabalus bowed down, had been fetched from the African coast beyond the Lybian desert; and did not Byblos, said ancient Egyptians, once possess the Phallos of Osiris, which they transported over the sea and emshrined in their ark at Philæ, asserting that it was originally an Egyptian god? Stories like these are innumerable, and we could cite similar cases which have come under our own cognizance in the East; for still do the gods leave their temples, and thus ignorant travellers exclaim, that “only the true God has been there worshipped.” because they cannot find any image or superscription in a deserted shrine. 1 Historians of Scotland, viii. 259, 298. 2 Supposed to arrive 600 B.C.

Early Shrines of Kelts. 379CHARACTER OF THE SKOTI.—The Skoti of Ireland were much looked up to as a brave, proud, martial, robust and superior race to the real Irenes. They were held to have been a Milesian Scaoth or colony, which arrived many years B.C.—some say a Gotho-Skythian race, and that the saying of Walsingham may be accepted, that “as Gethi Gethicus became Gothi Gothicus, so Scythæ Scythicus were Scoti Scoticus.” St. Patrik described them in the words “Filii Scotorum and filiæ Regu-lorum,” and their lineage was then said to stretch back to 1300 B.C. They were ad-dressed by the Irish as \"Masters and Rulers,” and it was they and never the true Hiberni, who from time to time invaded Pictish Alba and Britain, and waged constant war with Rome;1 and who finally, by strength of character and in spite of numbers, so asserted their power and individuality that the very name of Kale-dun-ian merged into that of Scotchman. Not till the eleventh century did these severe, stern and exclusive Gaels, consert that any of their kings should be crowned or buried elsewhere than near to their first landing-place by the monastery of Y-Colm-kil, and great has been the loss of valuable Skotch records from their persisting in trying to store them in this place. The shrine of Iona was known far and wide to be rich in treasures, mundane and divine, and on this account it was frequently plundered by the Picts, and from the ninth to the eleventh. centuries, still more severely by Pagan Danes and other Scandinavians. During the tenth century it was utterly devastated six times. The ANCIENT KELTS.—Having now shown that both Ireland and Kaledunia had a well-organized Druidik and true Asiatik faith, up to the sixth, and practically among the masses, up to the twelfth century, let us go on to describe its developments, pre-sent and prospective. We leam from Cesar and others that the favourite Keltik God, was Mercury son of Cœlus and Lux, he who wielded the phalik Caduceus or fascinus erecto, and that their “Great Father” was Dis or Dives, a form of Es or Esh (the Linga), and offspring of Saturn and Ops. Their temple was in Gaelik called a Fana or Fàine, from whence the Latin Fanum and English Fane—a grove, ring, or circle, Din, Caer or Cor, and always an open hypethral shrine, held specially holy, whether with or without a Tor, Leach, Crum, Al or Art, just as the Jewish temple was held sacred, though it lost its Testimony and Ark. In 452 we find the Lateran Council forbidding such worships, in ruinosis locis et sylvestribus, all over Europe, and the Council of Paris2 repeating the same in 1672, and ordering the destruction of sacred stones, etc., so that twelve hundred years had not sufficed to make the masses forsake the old faith. St. Marten of Tours, described one of the Faine which he destroyed, as “a turreted fabrik of highly-polished stones, out of which rose a lofty one constructed with great labour, and held to mightily preserve the dignity of the work and superstition of the place”—a sort of Irish tower in fact, rising from an artificial Gilgal, karn or mount. Another is de-scribed as having a columnam immensæ molis cui idolum superstabat, or a column of 1 Innes’ Essay. Hists. of Scot., viii., 285, 297. 2 Higgins’ Celtic Druids, p. 213."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 380immense size, upon which stood an idol, reminding us of the stelobites described by Gibbon and Imnan,1 of the Jachin and Boaz of Jews, and the sacred pillars of Tyrians and Mesopotamians. No beautiful or strange feature or freak of nature escaped the attention of these pious “Pagans.” Wherever she lavished her charms, there they planted the Faines. The peaks, if sharp, were Toth, Pan, Zin, Tina, or Peninus, as Jacob Grimm assures us;2 if blunted, the kephalik Mercury, Pi-or, Apis, Michael or Priapus, to whom the strange phalik symbol of the tongues of many animals, as well as of the sow must be offered as the vernal year advanced. If the hill was oviculuar or domed like the Mt. Moriah of Jews, then they called it the umbili-cus or fertile bosom of Terra, their Cered-wen, to whom all cavernous springs and numphean or moist recesses were sacred. She was the Keltik Demeter, whose symbol was the sacred ark, kauldron, bowl or holy grail, into which was poured with many strange mixtures, “the blood of the slain,” or of him who died for the sins of his people. In the Christianized tale, says the Rev. Bariing Gould, “the bardic table of the elect became the round table of Arthur’s knights, and the sacred vessel of mysteries (our sacramental cup) became the grail. The head of the victim was forgotten, and the sacrificial blood was supposed to be that of Christ.” The sacrificial Keltik skull, usually that of an enemy, was, says Livy, a bloody head and a national Keltik sym-bol. It was apparently brought into the temples au naturel, and there cleansed and adorned with gold, and after this used in festivities as a sacred vessel out of which to make drink offerings. Baring Gould draws prominent attention to the spear worship of these Kelts, from which some think their name as Skuths is derived, and gives a highly phalik sketch of a spear, as set up for worship with a prominent fleur-de-lis apex, on an altar or in a huge vase, which is often a conventional form for the Yoni. The Keltik sacred spear was described as “ever red and dropping blood,”3 as that shed for the people, so that we have but amplified and improved on the rites and symbols of our Skuthik forefathers, and not without reason, nor too soon. Herodotus said Skuthians sprang from a monster, half woman, half serpent, and that they long continued to worship such objects, together with their accompaniments—fire, water, and sacred wells, and these symbols still dwell in our midsts. Well-worship is not yet effaced among us, especially at Ascension and Assump-tion fêtes, which Catholics connect with the Virgin, always patroness of nymphs and numphean or watery rites. In Derbyshire, of Kimbrik proclivities. the good people of Tissington elaborately decorate certain “holy wells” for strange rites on Ascension day. The vicar of Tissington described this worship in the London Graphic of 22d May 1875, where are given drawings of the wells adorned with crosses, poles and arches, having such mottos as “God is Nature”—“He is not here, He is risen”—“God is gone up”—“Our Lord and King”—“Spring up, o Well.” Hindoos would accept this! 1 Anct.

Catholics throw pins into wells, as Kelts and Asiatiks throw stones to Hermes the Lingam god. "},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Keltik Blood and Drink Offerings. Modern Well Worship. 381From “time immemorial” says the vicar, have Derbyites at this season risen early and worked long and late, to decorate their wells fittingly with flowers, and strange devices, but especially the Tissington five—for the services of which the churches at the May festival are crowded. The pious vicar concludes his description by a prayer to the Almighty; “that all that had been begun and continued (the Pagan rites), might be ended, too, in Him;” and he blesses the crowd in the name of the Holy Trinity! Could Druid do more? In Ireland and other Catholic countries we still see vast multi-tudes hurrying to holy wells, especially on “our Lady’s Assumption Day.” Many Saints record their zeal throughout the eighth century in “overthrowing statues, images and sacred oaks,” along the banks of the Seine. Throughout Gaul and southern England they claim to have “filled up fountains and miraculous waters, extinguished fires and funereal piles, covered with earth the amphitheatre, (Circles and Fanes), and sacred stones, shut up everywhere the grottoes of the fairies, the smoking holes, prophetic caverns, and mysterious air holes.” Thus the old faith muat have considerably relaxed its hold on the affections of the middle and upper classes towards the end of the eighth century, for in Northern Britain and Ireland, such iconoclastic outrages would not then have been so tamely submitted to. Indeed very few parts of England would have tolerated such sacrilege even two and a half centuries later, for in the eleventh century, we find Canute forbidding Britons to worship “idols, heathen gods, the sun, moon, fire or rivers, water, wells, stones, and forest trees, or to love witchcraft, or promote Morth-work in anywise, by blot, or by fyrht, or to perform anything pertaining to such illusions;” and at thus time, “Bachanalian meetings were held round stones which were regarded as idols,” nay, deities. Down to comparatively modem times, these Pagan stones had Chris-tian symbols cut upon them, very often to preserve as well as consecrate them to the new idea. In this way were, “the three colossi, or lofty great stones” in the Mag-selga on which were graven JESUS, SOTER, SALVATOR, (some affirm by St Patrik), honored and preserved. None who knew the Esar of the North, or Ies-ian Bar-chus, and Priapian Salvator of the race, would object to still worship beside these Hermai; whilst those who were more ignorant, would only look upon the hieroglyphs as reflect-ing some still higher mystical honour upon their deities. The generality of our countrymen have no conception of the overruling prevalence of this faith. and the number of its lingam gods throughout our islands. We have been hood-winked by the unjustifiable term, “Crosses,” applied to the ancient symbols, which were always in the form of obelisks or columns, and erected on prominent places, as on knolls or open woodland sitest at cross roads and centres of marts or villages. These emblems were usually on a platform, raised one to five or even seven steps. The only plausible reason for calling these objects “Crosses,” is that being the Terminus or pillar-god, he is usually found where fields, paths, or highways meet or cross; and because the new faith, as it triumphed over the old, laboured to adapt, "},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 382Fig.277.—PYX, MONSTRANCE, AND DIVERS PHALIK EMBLEMS. re-model and re-name the old columns and pedestals, to suit the new idea, and in its ignorance lost sight of the old deity both in the Lingam and Cross. The Fire-god might still have his niches on these shafts, but with virgins and babies, having circles or halos round them, and in company with rayed suns, roses, triangles and horse shoe forms, sufficiently appropriate to please the most fastidious Yonik or Ionian worshippem; whilst arrows or spear-heads and daggers, were transformed into fleur de lis-charms, grateful to the vision of every Lingam devotee. The mutilation and transformation were probably thought complete, when the columns were surmounted with a cross in the old Tau or circle forms; which however, only rendered the whole more replete with Sivaik symbolism. It is not possible to here place before the reader, drawings of even the most typical old crosses of England, but let him take the Pyx and Monstrance of this Fig. 277 as the leading type, and ima-gine these, as large and usually highly ornate. For Luna holding the symbol of life—the cross—it would be the Madonna and babe in the emblematic Yoni-form, and for male emblems his Phalik Pyx and Cross. Old Kelts and Indian Sivaites would alike acknowledge such symbolism, nor reject any of the others seen in this engraving. The Yonish windows, cricle and triangle, flowers and fishy forms, from whence came Asyrian, Egyptian, and Episcopal hats, were all familiar to ophiolators, and solo-phalik wor-shippers. As education, or rather power to follow preachers —a great epok in the advancement of every race, was attained, these “Bethels,” or “Village Crosses” had roofs erected over them, or the roof was sprung from a point aoout three quarters up the shaft, and carried on pillars and buttresses; the base was in some cases cut away to give more room and shelter for gatherings. Elsewhere, the lingam was thickened or wholly encased, and so veiled by the ornate architecture of the time, that none but an awakened or practised and educated eye could detect the old symbolism. Such investigators as Britton, the archeologist, was not however to be so deceived, but his language was too mild and veiled, or he himself too ignornnt of Sivaism to awaken an ignorant public. Yet his descriptions are so truthful, that learned orientalists have long seen the true bearings of the subject. There is no mistaking the consistent conclusion of Britton’s researches as frequently stated in his Antiquities, viz., that “The original form of all ‘Market Crosses’ was simply a stem like Chester, or a tall shaft on steps.” This is upheld and ably proved by abundant and most significant engravings, in Mr. A. Rimmer’s excellent and popular little volume, Ancient Stone Crosses. The writer is thoroughly orthodox, "},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"The Old Lingams, Columns or “CROSSES” of England. 383Fig.279.—THE GOD AND WORSHIP OF THE ROMAN NYMPHEUM. Fig.278.—INNIS-MURRAY STONE. and does not appear to know anything of the old faiths. Britton’s description of “the original forms,” suits precisely this Innis Mura of Ireland, the god of the Roman nympheum, and all the unadorned Lin-gams of the Esat, as distinguished from the Sri-Lingams, or Linga-in-Argha. It was natural for the new priest to re-sort to the old and sacred places of meet- ings, at the foot of the old god’s pedestal, and in time to erect there a canopy or shelter of himself and congregation. Here all would listen with reverent attention, and the Nature worshippers would not be likely to imagine, that he who devoutly stood there uncovered, could have anything to say that pious men would not like to listen to. The preachers were also wisely “all things to all men,” at least at first, and it seemed only natural and proper, that the sacred obeliskal form should be re-tained, as indeed it more or less has been to the present time. Acoordingly we find a sorrowing Christian monarch repeating it in all the monuments he erected, to mark the spots where his dying Eleanor had succumbed. These elegant spires of the thirteenth century, erroneously called “Crosses,” are closely though unintentionally like the old life-god emblem, and surpass in beauty all the five thousand which then existed in England. The shires of Gloucester, Wilts and Somerset, still claim over two hundred “Crosses and remains of crosses,” erected not only as the centres round which towns grew, but on hill-tops, ilands, headlands, by sacred wells and on dangerous defiles. These goodly emblems were until two centuries ago, the Salvators which could, like Venus’ “Eye,” charm away the evil one, and even scare the most rapacious highwayman; for in Chester no robber would touch the wayfarer, who when in flight, reached the divine symbols.1 That these objects were a power in the land—re-cognized faith-emblems, we see from the fierce and persistent manner in which so many earnest Cbristian sects warred against them and all their ephemeral substitudes, such as “May poles,” holy trees and real crosses. The iconoclasts knew what others in later times forgot, that these were no modern symbols, but emblelms of their great enemy—that powerful faith which had struck its roots deep and widely into every sensuous and emotional feeling of man’s nature. Let us think of the attitude of mind which these newly-converted Kelts had arrived at about the eighth century. For the first time they had heard what they never dreamt of before, that the whole carnal man was vile, and all the natural desires of the flesh hateful in the sight of the new God, and that unless they managed to subdue these natural fealings of their humanity, they would infallibly be handed over like Job, to Yahue’s lieutenant, and thereafter consigned to this fiend’s eternal hell of excruciating torment. The old things 1 Rimmer’s Ancient Stone Crosses, p. 14."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 384Fig.280.—THE KELTIK TREE IDEA Fig.281.—TUISKO, “THE THORN GOD” OF MANY COUNTRIES Fig.282.—THE VERNAL LAMB ARES, WITH SYMBOLS OF LIFE AND HEAT. had to be put away, and all things to be renewed, and, more difficult than all, the old man, with his affections and lusts. Uncleanliness in house and person, they were well accus-tomed, to, but to live a lone and aacetic life in foul caves and dark forests, like Southern Christians, was uncongenial to these children of the North. Scourgings, nudity, and a her-mits scant fare did not suit them with their colder climate, and we are all considerably influenced by this last; they agreed however, to monasteries and nunneries, and soon most willingly congregated in fine Abbeys amidst lovely scenery, there to hold lands, collects tithes and live on the good cheer which the masses—serfs and slaves—collected for them. Here they soon learned and gladly accepted all Bible teachings which gave them so much power and so many good things, and doubtless strongly aided in making them declare was against the old Druidik system, and its too palpable Nature em-blems—the old Priapian gods which, until then they had seen as her, “naked and not ashamed.” This Jovine tree which their ancestors has so long trimmed into their Trinitarian idea, this “Thorn God” which they has so oft fenced round as here to keep rude hands and cattle from his sacred precincts, and many similar very ancient symbols, were all now to be exchanged for the dolorous emblem of the thorn-crowned peasant of Galilee. He was, however, invested with god-hood and many archaik ideas, such as they could better appreciated; though the Lamb of the vernal year with cross and and circle, yet had he the “human form divine,” their well known Abelia, or heavenly Ares—the joyful Apollo of the opening year. The new faith also freely permitted all conventional cruciform and caduceus-like symbols, so the robust abbots declared was with the zeal proverbially common to converts, against all the old symbols, unles sufficiently veiled or too strong to be immediately struck down. Fortunately for archeology and us however, there were then as now, many lovers of the old things and past times, but mostly of Anglo-Saxon blood, who though from no spirit of toleration, urged a quieter conservative progress, and a more emblematical religion than that desired by the Puritan and iconoclastic rage of the times. These conservatives rededicated the old emblems, stones, circles, groves, wells, etc., and had most of them duly baptized and renamed. The Phalik and Yoni forms, dagger and spear-heads, cup or grail emblems sacred to great Don or Emruys, Ceridwen or Io, were claimed for symbols of the Cross and Passion and the blood spilt on Calvary!

The Transition. 385Pillar-God might still stand and have his rights and fetes, but he was in future to be called by such names as “The Preaching Cross,” “The mourning or Passion Cross,” etc. And those who went to the emblems (for the so-called “converts” would not stay away from them), were told to remember that on this account only they were insti-tuted. The tutelary god-idea, viz., that a special deity watched over each village, nay, family and profession, might still be taught, but these were to be “saints,” or should be named after Christ, Mary, Gabriel, Michael, etc., and further, were to be considered as emanations of “a Great Incomprehensible,” or rather of “three incomprehensibles in one unity;” for the creed of St. Athanasius was now per-plexing mankind, with its contradictions and impossibilities. Is it so wonderful that our rude ancestors listened in dazed bewilderment, and only took in an infinitessimal amount of what they heard? But let us strive to now describe a few of the best known types of the so-called “old market crosses of England.” This is a hard task both for writer and reader without drawings like the elaborate and expensive ones from which our descriptions will be made, but the reader may rely an our closely following the best existing descriptions and drawings, and he must try to realized them in his mind’s eye. Many good libraries will supply detailed sketches, and in the case of most, the zealous traveller may go and himself view the originals or rather the metamorphized old monuments, for these are in situ, or if not so now, local museums will generally show all the old details and give their true, as well as much legendary history. “CHESTER HIGH SHAFT.”—Britton describes this as a simple tall shaft “on steps.” Crom- well’s soldiers destroyed it, but it was pieced together afterwards in a sort of lantern form. GLENDOWER SHAFT at Corwen, Merioneth.—This was a blunted column, with a Yoni or Omega form at head, and a “curious dagger” or spear—the conventional phalik device. STALBRIDGE, DORSET.—This is a thirty feet shaft, on three steps, which has been cut and added to, and has now figures of the Virgin and St. John in various niches. The ancient non-sculptur- ing races, would here be likely to put Io and Ion emblems. IRON-ACTON, Gloucestershire. “Crosses” at Hereford, Malmesbury, Chichester.—The first was a light octagonal obelisk, but the base has been cut away and the upper shaft supported by four converging columns carrying a roof or canopy for a speaker. The “crosses” of Malmesbury, Here- ford, Chichester and many others have been similarly treated, but sometimes the centre shaft is left as in the Leighton Buzzard or Bosard in Bedford, and sometimes the old Lingam symbolism is still more perfected, of course unwittingly, as when the column is carried through a roof; for then looking at the object as a whole, which the votaries of the solo-phalik faiths invariably do, we have an emblem suitable for the adoration of either the Lingaik or Ionik sects—a sri-lingam or the male-triune god. AYLBURTON and LYDNEY SHAFTS in Gloucestershire.—These are Sivaik-like columns, on raised and stepped pediments; they are recessed and blunted or marred at the apex. HEMSTED, Gloucestershire.—This is a tall, narrow, and shart obelisk rising from five steps, and carrying a solar disk with cross, evidently a later addition, for this kind of phalus points to bull worship. AN ARK OR CELL known as OUR LADY’S WELL, close to Hemsted and St. Mary’s, High Street, Lincoln.—These are arkite structures, like the Kibla, “Tomb of Cyrus” or the Sun; such objects were usually sacred to Cere or Cered-Wen. THE BISLEY SHAFT, Gloucestershire.—This is a perfect Lingam or the glans of one, such as we see on Asyrian altar sculpturings, and it is said to be built over a sacred well."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 386OBELISKS OF WHITE FRIARS, Hereford, and Clearwell, Gloucestershire, and Bromboro, Cheshire.—These are tall slim shafts, rising from sockets, resting on seven steps. The first is said to have been erected by Bishop Charlton at the time of the plague, over “a plague stone,” and herein con- sists its value; it “had a hollow,” by which we conclude it was a Yoni-charm like those so commonly dedicated to Māya in India, to war off smallpox, etc. TOTTENHAM or TOT-HAMSHIRE.—This is a covering to the old Toth or Linga, and is now a solid spire, rising straight from the ground, which our author says is the favourite form in the eastern counties; he might have said, throughout the eastern world! SAND-RACH SHAFTS, Cheshire, CAREW SHAFT, Pembroke.—The first two, says Crewe Hall, are shafts of the hardest salurian stone, now it is said “cut all over with Christian subjects,” though nails, hammers, pincers and serpents, appear there also. They are rude enough to compete with the Runik Stone, West Kirby, and shaft at Carew. They seem to mark in their difference of age that “long hiatus from the Roman period to the early dawn of British history,” over which all the chronicles we possess cast but an uncertain light.1 See also the Cross of Iona and of Monasterboice-Lowth. EYAM CROSS, Peak of Derbyshire. Bakewell, RUNIK COLUMN; NEVERN COLUMN, Pembroke. —This first is sculptured like the Runik Shafts of West Kirby, and clearly has not been carved by Christians except in the cruciformed head. It is more like columns found in the Isle of Man, in Ireland and Scotland. Bakewell has similar Runik circles, but no head. The Nevern Shaft would pass for a good Maha-Deva in any part of India. See Rimmer’s drawing. CHEDDAR SHAFT on the Mendip Hills, North Petherton, and Dindar, Somerset. CHIPPING COLUMN, Chipping, Campden, North Gloucestershire.—These are or were, the most perfect “Maha-devas” possible, both as to column and pediment, being raised on three steps, like so many eastern lingams; that at Cheddar also, is now surrounded by a screem, and would therefore claim the hearty worship of every Sri-linga devotee. Mr. Rimmer’s picture on page 110 is remarkably like an ordinary good Indian Siva. Yorkshire “Crosses” are usually raised on steps as in India. GLASTONBURY SHAFT.—This too was clearly a lingam or glans, such as Asyrians worshipped, but much more tapered, and ending in a nude figure. Britton wrote, that it had fallen with the building surrounding it—the Yoni or cell—into complete decay in his time; that it was “something peculiarly unique” both as to shape and surroundings, having “a large column in the centre running through the roof, terminating with a naked figure.” No Maha-deva-ite could seek better sym- bolism, and no “English writers,” complained Britton, “seem ever to have attempted to account for its form or even existence.” They neither knew the symbolism or the Faith, and therefore could not. GLOUCESTER COLUMN.—This is now a built-up shaft, probably a mere casing over the old deity, and much adored with Gothik niches. Above the casing rises a lingam-like column somewhat similar to the last three, surmounted by a cross-staff—the only justification for the name “cross.” SHAFTS of Devizes, Wiltshire, Holbeach, Lincoln, Cirencester, Ampney Crucis, Wheston, Derby, Bitterly, Salop, Cricklade, Langley, Norwich.—The Devizes shaft is a clear instance of trying to efface the old emblem, whilst that of Holdbeach is probably an unwitting illustration of the same. The others here mentioned seem to have escapted Christian spoliation, save in the adornment of bases and heads, where male and female saints find places, once possibly meant for fire or Solo-phalik emblems. The reader will probably think these are enough to illuatrate my argument. If he will study such elaborate works as those of Stukely. Sir R. C. Hoare’s Ancient History of Wiltshire, Higgins’ volumes, and many other formerly much misunderstood writings, in the light which Asiatik faiths have since thrown on these matters, I have no doubt of the result, and have seenn many instances of it. It is not a question with us as to the age of the British monuments of the faith. The younger they are, the more firmly do they show the persistence and all-pervading force which the old religion exercised upon our ancestors. I am therefore quite willing, for the purposes of this 1 Rimmer’s Ancient Crosses, p. 82. Near Islip, Oxfordshire, is a Hermaik “Cross-Tree” with stones heaped round it.

Bath, and its Gods. 387work, to accede to the leamed writer of Cyclops Christianus,1 that the columns of Stonehenge and Avebury, etc., were erected in their present positions after the Romans left our Pagan forefathers. The author does not by any means prove this, but gives forcible reasons for showing that the old faiths were then very strong, though no sufficient reasons for accusing Christians of erecting the old shrines. The original sites of the ancient religion, belong to times which we can never discover; we can only trace back many scenes bringing them into prominence. Let us glance at one very favourite Keltik and Roman site, Old Bath, bordering on Wilts, Somerset and Glouces-tershire, all counties famous for their prehistoric remains. BATH.—Romans knew Bath as a place sacred to Sol, and called its healing thermal springs, Sol’s Water, and the highest of its conical hills Sol-is-bury, not pro-bably after the Latin Sol, but the older Eastern and Keltik, Sol, Seul, Sul or Heul, the Herman-Sul or “Great Pillar-God”—that Mercury upon which Jacob Grimm dwells so strongly.2 Kelts knew Bath as the sacred “Sun enclosure,” and more anciently by the solar titles of Kaer-Ak, Ake-man, and Akeman-nesceaster, as well as Caer-Palli-dar, on which account probably the Romans considered the solar form of the Bath deity to be Pallas Minerva, and therefore named the mountain Sul-Minerva, erect- ing on it a temple to the dual deity. The waters of healing fame they called Aqua Solis. It was only after some centuries of neglect, when Kelts and Romans had been forgotten, that Angles called it “The Bath,” and began to resort to its then neglected shrine. In its neighbourhood there were formerly numerous peaked hills, evidently sacred, as the names of some still denote. The river Avon itself seems named after the “Fount of Light.”3 It was an Ain Shams or “well of On,” or of Suil himself, and a River spirit of holy and serpentine form. It would be here very solemnly wor-shipped, as well as further down the vale, near to that wondrous solar-circle now known as the Amber, or “sacred enclosure” adjoining the “bury,” now no more. The Kelts appear also to have called the town of “The Bath” or shrine—some part of Old Bath of these days—Caer Badon or Caer B’Adon, a solar term in which B is doubtless the affix Ba, Bel or B’āl—strong or influential. “Badonica” is the ancient name for “Beacon Hill.” Even Christianity kept up the old refrain, for she divided the site of the borough into three parishes, with the usual phalo-solar names of St Michael (Mercury or Mah-Kal), St James (Iam-esh, Jove the sun), and St. Peter the Petros, or sacred sun-stone. Long before this arrangment, howevor, the Christian virgin had taken the place of the Pagan one, archæologists being only doubtful whether the church of St. Mary de Stall is on the site of the temple of Minerva or Apollo, and part of the Roman Principia. Stall, stable or cave are the usual crades of Apollos. 1 By A.

"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 388The differencc between IO and ION, is one of no consequence to the student of faiths, for Apollo must shine wherever the heavenly queen or virgin holds court, and “the Virgin of the Manger,” as the priests of the new faith explained de Stall, was here, as in Syria, “The Lady of Lechem” or “Bread distributer.” She was the Sanskrit Griha or Grein God’s house, and her symbols, as the moon, a star (Venus), a mirror (as in Egypt), a burning bush (the Agni mandalum of Hindooism), a lily or lotus and a rose, are all to be still seen in the east winduw of the Bailiwick parish church, dedicated to her as “St. Mary the Virgin.” KELTIK RULE.—On what date the earliest Kelts conquered and settled in England with their Asiatik fetishes and symbols (to which Phenicians added), we do not know, but we may fairly accept the sixth century wave, or any previous Skuthik one. When British Roman History opens, we find that English Kelts were commonly known as Belgæ, and very prominent Bel-worshippers. They had overrun the greater part of England about 350 B.C.—driving onwards, and partly ruling other and earlier “Keltik Britons.” It was the Belgæ Kelts whom Rome subdued about the beginning of our era, stepping in between them and their adversaries, the British Kelts. On the retirement of the Legions, about 410 A.C., the still irrepressible early Kelts again rose in arms, and pressed the Belgæ so hard, that they urgently besought the Emperor Honorius to assist them; which he did for a while, down to the year 422, when all Romans finally left the island. After this, history is silent: indeed, the hiatus is complete. No detailed history exists from 400 to 700, or even 760. This was the period when Belgik or Keltik paganism reigned, and when the people, having profited by the arts and solo-phalik religion of Rome, would be most likely to firmly and systematically establish or re-establish, their own peculiar native shrines, priests and altars.1 During this period also, as our Plate II. prefacing this volume shows, all Asiatik Skuthia was in motion—our Cycle-clock was about to sound its important sixth peal (see cross bars on Cbart), and Eastern nations were everywhere on “the war path.” Pagan Saxons, Saxones or Seistanes, Jutes and all manner of Skuthians, were now firmly pushing westward, and as in 600 B.C., so again, were quiet and settled peoples, fleeing to their walled cities, and terrified Jeremiahs were now again. crying: “Flee in haste, stay not . . . the evil has come down from the north. . . . The lion has come up from the thicket. and the destroyer of nations has moved his camp. He has gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate, and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant;” which, in the case of Syria, was nevertheless not true, as the brave Northmen passed by the walled cities and their pusillanimous garrisons with apparent contempt. The Prophet excused his countrymen by adding:2 “It is a mighty nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not. . . . Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they are all warriors. . . . thy shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread, . . . thy flocks 1 Cf. previous page and Herbert’s Stonehenge.  2 Jeremiah iv. and v."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"The Eastern Migration of 5th to 7th Cents. A.C., and their results. 389and thy herds, . . . thy vines and thy fig trees. . . . They shall break down thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst with thy sword”—another mistake on the prophet’s part, which might have been avoided had he been moving more bravely about, instead of taking refuge in Egypt and other hiding-places. Again then was Asiatik heathenism re-enforced, and again did Eastern gods, fetishes and every form of Hun, Alan and Vandal paganism revisit Europe, and crowd the not unwilling land with its wild mythologies and strange traditions. Again did it revivify the old sites, and their too willing votaries, with a power and fervor which at one time seemed all too strong for a faith, founded on a mongrel Boodhism, sprung of Essenik, Therapeutik, and corrupt Christian doctrines. That which was to benefit mankind, still slumbered in the hearts or writings of obscure Christians. This mystik Pagan tide showed some strange phazes. Fires were relighted in all the old sacred groves, and hundred of worshippers marched over a great part of Europe, carrying censers and lanterns of sacred fire, and demanding the worship of their old god, whom they prophesied was once again to rule supreme. Under such circum-stances we may be quite sure that rural Ale-manns, Ibiri, Kelts and all Allophylian peoples, if they hesitated, only did so from fear least the tide should be eventually stemmed, and they be caught stranded on a short of the dead, aye, of the cruelly impaled and tortured dead; for they had already experienced, to their dire misery, the “tender mercies” of Christian governors, and knew that Christianity, though perhaps unable to immediately cope with the spasmodic outbursts of its old Asiatik enemy, was still in its vigorous youth, and too well organized not to triumph in the long run. All these Eastern irruptions left however, their mark one way or another and even to these times, in the fierce antagonisms of sects and races. Thus the Iberian proper, got quite severed from the Iberian Bask, as much as the British. Kelt did from the Continental, and the Saxon and Anglo-Saxon from both. Nothing would induce the old Amorikan of the Morbihans to amalgamate with the new Gaul, Frank or Norman. The old Gavaches of the Langue d’oc, Cagots, Caas-goths, Gothik dogs? and other aborigines were mutually repulsive. and the Francs forbade, or at least, prevented these from owning any land; nay, this law still exists. All through the thirteenth century oppressive civil laws, crushed the. spirits of the old Eastern-like tribes, as we know so well in the case of the Albigois or Albigenses. France and Spain have done their best to stamp out an old Phenician element said to still exist along the southern ports of these two countries, where their race once ruled supreme. Even little Switzer-land hates and refuses fellowship with clans, who of old held the Rhetan Alps: and Frenchmen still shun those Eastern-like, darkish, but bright-eyes Burhins and Chize-rots, who congregate about Macon, and who were lately, if indeed they are not still called, one fo the Races Maudites or “accursed ones.” Such indeed have been the fruits of religions, some of which have even announced, that they come not with peace but the sword, and to establish enmity and even war among brethren."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 390Up to the ninth century A.C., there was abundant room for any faith to find a footing in Europe, and at all times a sufficiency of highly inflammable materials, which ever and again stirred up Christianity to do or die. The progress of the faith was indeed far slower than any histories relate, for the masses were unspeakably illiterate, superstitious and brutish. We have shown that English bishops used in the sixteenth century to test their clergy annually as to their ability to repeat the Lord’s prayer, &c., and we lately heard the Baptist Home Missionary Society of Scotland proclaim that “though the Established, Free, and United Presbyterian Churches existed through- out every parish in the iland of Skye (once so famous for its stone worship), yet that the people from one end to the other were in gross darkness as to the simple truths of Christianity!”1 The reader need not therefore wonder at the chrono- logical fact stated in our tables (pp. 201-203), that not till the close of the eighth century did Englishmen as one people, begin to freely tolerate the faith. It was only indeed, after Charlemagne had checked the roving Norsemen, and the Danish Harold had been baptized (for which however, he lost his throne in 826), and after the Swedes had accepted a Christian king, that southern England, harassed and wearied with constant and devastating Pagan invasions, thought seriously of adopting the new faith. It was then she sought for and found, an able Christian king in the person of the youthful Alfred, the youngest son of King Ethelwolf; and she was fortunate. To considerable literary accomplishments, Alfred who had studied at Rome, added approved bravery amd wisdom .in the field. Step by step he expelled his country’s invaders, and so vindicated even to those who disliked the new faith, his right to ascend an English throne, which he did in 871. Though not by any means the chosen of a Christian people, yet he quickly commended his faith to all, by establishing social order and written laws; so that the new doctrines started with everything in their favour, not excepting the times, for it was the middle of the mystik cycle in which the ethnik forces are mostly quiescent, and King Alfred had therefore a time of comparative peace up to the end of that century. He was assisted also in the far north by the Skoto-Pictish King Donald in expelling all Pagan foreigners, which the increasing power of the Skoti over Pagan Kale-duns had rendered easy; but let us go back for a little to the sixth and seventh centuries, and Bath-ways. The immediate effect of the Anglo-Saxon conquest, born of Asiatik strife, was, says Professor Lechler, “to send a new wave of Paganism over the land, and to give Pagans full sway even over all southern England, in 577.”2 So that from Lands-End to Orkney, there was little appreciable or at least practical difference in the religious pro-gress of Kelts, Angles and Saxons. Columba was trying to make Picts listen to him, and little clusters of Columba-ites were founding Cells, Killes or monastaries; and so 1 Baptist General Meeting is Glasgow, October 1878, as reported in the Edinburgh Scotsman of 25th October 1878. 2 Wiclif and his Eng.

The so-called Christians there managed in 596, to obtain permission to erect a temple to one whose mythical history of freebooting knight-errantry, these lawless and rebellious tribes fully appreciated and called their “Saint David,” the man “after their Yahue’s own heart.” Though Christian in name, they were steeped in their old Phalo-Solar faiths, and would therefore see little differ-ence betwixt David the son of Ishi the Jahvite and parent of “the Virgin Mother of God,” and their old loved Caer-ed-Wen and Sul-Minerva of the adjoining Caer-ak or Caer-Palli-dar of “Old or Little Bath.” We find, consequently, that they erected their shrine to “Saint David” as close as possible to the old temple of Apollo or Sul-Minerva, the dual pillar-God. Hermen Sul, whose phalik characteristics Jacob Grimm so fully describes, to him who can read betwixt his polished periods. A hundred years after the erection of St. David’s shrine, apparently in the year 676, the rude quasi Christian King Osrik of Northumbria, attempted to establish a monastery, but English Pagans and foreign Danes alike combined to resist this, pro-bably disliking the lazy, useless habits of the inmates; for before it was two years old they attacked and so ruthlessly destroyed the buildings, that none then living dared to make a similar attempt; and so the faith here passed into its eighth century, when the tempest-tossed barque ceased to fear all outside enemies. About this time, says the Venerable Bede, Nektan, the King of Kale-duns, had begun to more particularly inquire as to the new rites and doctrines then coming into vogue. He evidently now thought it judicious to sail with the ever-increasing current of intelligence, irrespective of his own views; so in 710, by the advice of the Abbot of Jarrow, he assembled all his nobles, priests and Culdees at Skone, and begged of them to give up their semi-Druidik or Columbian faith and practices, and “to observe the new rites and dogmas;” for up to this time as Eusebius says, the Chrisitian faith was here only “a blasphemous Skythian heresy”—a Columba-ism, suited only to Druidik circles and such rural shrines. Now, a Zion of the faith, the Mote-hill or “Mount of Belief”1 at Skone, was to be selected, reconsecrated and purified from all its dear old Pictish memories. The old faith was however too persistent, and the Skone rites soon again became all that even the most fastidious of Druidik Picts of these times could desire; indeed it could scarcely be otherwise at the seat of their old Zion, for it had been ever tru1y a Zaon, Zon, Sun or Son2 Mount, where their god of fertility, circles and cycles, had hitherto reigned supreme, and here still his holy tires burned and sacrifices bled. As St. Boniface is said to have converted the Pictish King, this could only have taken place in 730, and it would therdore require at least a hundred years more, or to the middle of the ninth century, before the masses could know much about their monarch’s new faith. Sharp though the sword of the church then soon became, Nektan lost his throne and nearly his life by his Christian zeal, but he got back to 1 Proc. Soc. of Ants.

The new faith was then causing great trouble in the land, and clearly Nektan like “Constantine the Great,” wisely chose what seemed the winning side. The report that not only England, but Gauls and brother Britons, were going gradually but surely over to Romanism (as it was even then called) was known to all Picts. The priests of the chureh. also had felt their power, a.nd now ca.red. little for the con-version of the Pictish court. Revolution was rife, and they saw that they could sell their aid and leap to power. The Irish Skoti in Alba were mostly Christians, and determined to rule the Pictish kingdom, and finally accomplished this, when Kenneth MacAlphine succeeded his father Alpine, King of the Scots, in 833. He established himself over all “the kingdom of Skone” in 842, by treacherously invit-ing all the Pictish nobles to a banquet and murdering them.1 In sixty-four years more or so in 906, the church saw a king and bishop of St. Andrews fulminating laws and orders from “the Mount of Belief, near the royal city of Skone;” and two hundred years after this, a monastery was here founded by Alexander I., though with many of the old Druidic rites as already related, but which were adapted to suit the altered tastes of Culdees as well as Romanized Christians. Irishmen went forth as missionaries of learning and religion to Europe as early as the sixth century, whilst continental students went to “The Ile of Sainrs” as Carlovingians called Ireland, to study its sacred literature, or mayhap those historik and traditionary compilations of their ancestors, which had, as already explained. found a last sheltering place in this far-off “Ile of the West.” Throughout the Carlovingian period, Irish literateurs overran the whole Frank Empire. The monasteries of Brabant, Verdun, Ratisbonne, Wurzburg, Erfurth, Cologne and away down into Italy, as at Bobio, were all called Monasteria Scotorum, and had libraries and schools attached to them, said to be founded by “Irish Saints.”2 Ireland itself soon stagnated. It had never been stirred into life by Romans, but inundated to its hurt by pious Kelts and devout, dogmatic, peace-loving people, who had fled from their duties, and the stern battle of life. Let us leave it for a time, to trace the busier life developing in the West of England, now that Christianity was firmly established. The dark ages were stemly setting in on the Continent, and looming fitfully over our island homes. It was a priestly shroud which was enveloping the people, and chilling with the touch of death every effort to improve their social or intellectual condition. Culture was felt by the priests to be the sure path to political power and wealth, and should therefore they said, alone belong to God’s vicegerents, and to the officers of His Church. And very soon it was so; whilst confronting these educated ecclesiastics, were only poor swinish serfs, steeped in superstititions—slaves, aye, willing slaves, glad to be owned by any great lord or master. This Religion was following the path of all Faiths. Priestcraft was too strong for simple Goodness. 1 Proc. Soc. of Ants.

Emancipation of Serfs. 393The antagonism, however was strong as the antagonists were unequal, and irrespective of truth or goodness in life or doctrine, it was plain on which side the balance would now sway. The Christians had indeed nought to fear, save from that self-abasement which ever . . . . “paves the way To villain bonds and despot’s sway.” And this course they unwittingly, but in the long run fortunately, did adopt, by giving full rein to insatiable avarice, lust and greed for all life’s good things. Abbots, prists, monks and friars soon got the king and nobles, and with them the servile masses into their hands, as well as most of the lands and revenues of the kingdom. The people were sold with their fields from hand to hand like cattle, and indeed were often not held of so much account! When the first Abbey of Bath was built, King Osrik handed over the required lands and endowment, with one hundred tenant families, to the Abbess Bertona, who at once sold all the women, children and feeble ones, to purchase materials, wherewith she made the able-bodied ones construct the buildings, drain, plant and improve her abbey lands. The ruling of these “good old Christian times” was, that the people or Menente—the legal term fitly denoting the poor slaves—belongs absolutely to the king, abbots, priests and nobility; and this ruling was fiercely maintained down to even the days of William the Conqueror. Worse than the old Druidism was here, and legally established by the accredited followers of him who desired that we should “call no man master.” Manumission, or the per-mission to purchase freedom by payments in gold and cattle, continued down to a far later date, and even this was only granted by those slave dealers, in order that they might realise gold and cattle for such increase of their human herds as thy could not conveniently retain and feed. Nay, good breeding families were carefully retained, so as to realise profit in cattle and gold. There was no pretence as to putting down slavery, for the faith sanctioned it, even Christ adopting the Old Testament teaching.1 History records that in 1300, the abbeys, nunneries and monastik establisments, held all the best lands in the kingdom, and had mostly received these “for the Lord’s sake;” and the Lords of the Vineyard even cruelly farmed out the taxes, alike of towns, villages, fields and gardens, but retained in their own hands a monopoly of all pro-fitable sales and produce. The servants of him, who would. not touch Cesar’s money, had become not only publicans, but extensive traders and manufacturers; so much so that their princely transactions, threatened to swamp the civil power, and for a genera-tion or so back, kings had begun to find that the kingdom. was too small for the monks and them. In 1270 a “statute of Mortmain was framed to restrain the cupidity of the churches”—bold language to be openly expressed and too bold to be acted upon, for the statute lay dormant for nearly two generations. Not till 1330 did King Edward dare to put it in force, and then only very quietly. From this period new tyrants were to rule the land, but with this great difference, that the serfs had 1 Gen. xviii. 23; xxii. 10; Ex. xxi. 2-21; Lev. xxv. 44-46; Num. xxxi. 40; Josh. ix.; 1 Kings ix. 15, 22."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 394now learned to speak, and had determined to make their voice heard; and in some two hundred years more, in combination with the monarchs of the sixteenth century, they helped to suppress not only abbeys, monasteries and convents, but to sell the very churches. Free thought of a mild kind now for once began to breathe, though within very limited bounds; but this is all modern history, which it is no part of our task to enter upon. We must now hie back to prehistoric times, and to the most debatable of these, and try to get as correct an idea of them as modern research enables us to do. Prehistoric History.—Though we may not here positively fix either names or times, yet we can discriminate races, and if so, faiths. and this long prior to the advent of Keltæ or other Aryans. Now, although the reader may think he has had enough of these and all earlier races, yet as we proceed he will acknowledge the necessity of further prehistoric research. The best writers on these subjects declare, as we have shown in some little detail, that our islands were first overrun by darkish races, beginning with offshoots from Akads, Sumirs, Aithiops, Kuklops, Kuths or SKuths, Iberians and Silures, not generally classified as Aryans, but as Alofilians.1 It was with or after these, that there came to Britain the brachy-kephalous Pictish people, who painted or tatooed their bodies with figures of animals and reptiles in a manner still very familiar to us in that eastern Auria Chersonese, Barma, Tenaserim and Siam. We now wish to consider the Alofilian, Aithiopian or Kuklopian peoples, who first swarmed all over Asia, Africa and Europe, and to do this we must go much further back than the times of Keltic Greeks of Achaians, Pelasgi, or even Phenicians, old though these be in the presence of the Juventus Mundi of Aryan Atiks. Even then we will not presume as these did, to speak of authochthons, or the true aborigines of any land. Long before Phenician days, probably before the first true Aryans left their high-Asian home, Europe had been peoples by races akin to Finns, Esthonians, etc., which for lack of a better name, may be termed Turanians. We may begin at about 5000 B.C., by which time most of our best authorities admit that Egypt had much of her wondrous Rituals and Liturgies, and at which time our own studies make us agree with Baldwin where he says, that “Arabian Cushites had obtained their first settlements in Spain and Northern Africa.”2 From them, apparently by intermixture with the ancient Turanians, sprang the first Iberians of Spain (of which the ancient Basks may be a remnant), the Ligues, Ligustinoi, or Ligurians3 of Northern Italy, not yet called Turhenia or Turania, for we speak of times before Pelasgi and Keltæ had yet advanced from Asia. We leam that Heraklios a solarist, contended with these Ligues (no doubt true Lingaites), from the valleys of the Po to the Rhone, and that the solarites were aided in resisting the western invaders, by the Heli-suki of Narbon and the Iberians. 1 Journ.

No Keltik Umbrians, Sabines, Etrurians, Touskoi or Turrenoi then ruled, though the Italian world must, according to our research, have been very old even then. Plato says, with more discernment than his opponents, that Egyptian arts, including drawing and painting, flourished about 10,400 B.C,; that the first Zoroaster had lived, and a flood had buried the great island of Atlantis (probably meaning that sailors had then forgotten how to navigate the Atlantik), about 9300 B.C., which also is about the time to which Sargon’s tablet of 700 B.C. takes back the beginning of the proto-Kaldian kingdom.1 Bunsen traces back Egyptian kings to 9085 B.C., and Sais is held to give numerous symptoms of organised government through all the ninetieth century B.C. Some held that Memphis existed in the eightieth century, and that Egypt was a confederacy of States, with a Menes of Menetho I., then trying to form it into one kingdom; and that the seventieth century say this effected, and a great advance made in art, science and astronomy, including the scientific construction of the Zodiaks. About this age also, did our three great classes of language, the Aryan, Shemitik and Turanian, probably differentiate, or enter what Max Müller calls there “Rhematic period,” for, according to Strabo, early in the sixtieth century, Iberians and other Aryans, with a considerable social organization, were then moving westwards. Indeed, this is a CYCLIK CENTURY, and the CREATION ERA of many nations, when great events occurred and each though his own little world was then created; probably because it then rose into political and religious life under one or more strong rulers; as when Seth-ites or Set-worshippers, a well-known Egyptian sect of Linga-ites, left their quiet paradise—the patriarchal cradle, which some Arabian writers with justice aver, was not in Mesopotamia but the Nile valley. Then, too, occurred that Cuthite or Aithiopiau westward movement,which we are at present considering. Aithiopian Asia and Mizra-im or' Mith-ra-ites, had given birth to Solo-phalik wor-shippers called Ham-ites, Chamites or Am-Onites, who were searching out new lands in the west, but who lost their names and some distinctive features in doing so. Who, when, were these? The problem is one we can only aid in solving. It is no part of the design of this work to discuss the vexed question of the ethnological history of ancient Egypt, or indeed of any nation, but rather to merely use all tolerably well-established ethnological stand-points, towards the elucidation of the roots and otherwise observed religious biases of peoples; yet, as the reader should know the doubts and difficulties of this subject, we will here very briefly state the views of those who have made the ethnography of Egyptians their special study. Of course, we must not too closely commit the writers named, to the sharp lines which brevity here compels us to adopt. The writers no doubt qualify and explain their views, but seem on the whole to favor the brief enunciations here given.

There is still therefore, a darkness here which can be felt, but it is a great gain to know our ignorance, and also, that we have here ample space to try and fill in the traditions handed down to us by mythologies and otherwise. We are also left in no doubt as to the faiths which wouId come from the Kaukases, and stone-loving Arabia; and, therefore, of the gods and symbols of Thinis, Sais, Memphis, or the first Misr or Mithr. The second Misr is our Cairo, a cor-ruption of the Arabian Al-kahira, “The Conqueror.” Kaldians knew Caixo as Maples, and Hosea called it Moph or Noph, and the whole land Mitsr. 4000 to 3000 B.C.—Let us see what can be made of the traditions sprang so evidently from the Cuthite movements, of the 40th or possibly 50th C.B.C. when a Menes was apparently establishing a firm Egyptian Monarchy, and the gre:at Pyrronid was rising from the sands on the margin of the Mediterranean, and not as now among those of the Lybinn desert. The mythical Ouranos had probably before this been a real and powerful monarch with three sons, who claimed and obtained separate kingdoms. These were Bet-ulus, Atlas and Saturn, with an Eastem reIative Amon who more especially clung to his Arabian father-land. These names though seemingly mythical, probably embody historical facts, and clearly point to faith-movements. According to the best authors.

There seems little doubt that one of the Americas had been long known to a previous adventurous race, fit fathers of the Phenicians, for Marcellus also in his Aithiopian History, describes this Land of Atlantis as “of prodigious magnitude and governing all the islands in the Atlantia Ocean”;1 and holding as we do with Humbolt, that “myths when blended with history and geography cannot be regarded as pertaining wholly to the domain of the ideal world,” then we see here with regret that the Americas have been lost to the European world for some five thousand years after their first discovery. The story of the Atlantik island is held by Mr. Baldwin to strengthen his views as to the Kuthite invasion of Spain, being not later than 5000 B.C.; for Menes being 4000 B.C., his time cannot it is held, be as old as that indicated by the myths concerning the expeditions of Herakles in the West, and Spain and Africa must then have been independent countries before Menes’ time, if the myths have any significance whatever. Now Manetho’s chronology is becoming more and more accepted wherever the chains of orthodoxy are not too strong, and his great history of 300 B.C. was never questioned by the learned, centred around the literary treasures of Alexandria for above 20 generations after his day, nor indeed till about the 5th C., when Christian and Jewish Rabim saw this to be absolute1y neces- sary in order to sustain their own so-called divine inspirations. We too often blame Archbishop Usher for our own pertinacious upholding of the dates on the margins of our Engliah Bibles; but this is unjust, for these are as close to the so-called Biblical facts—that is, to the names and their stated Bible chronologies—as they well can be. Of course the record is very imperfect; and often contradictory to the extent even of making a son older than his father, and missing out and altering names, etc.; but nevertheless, Usher’s chronology is the only possible one for the Bible-Christian, as we shall elsewhere make very clear. Egyptian history and chronology fail us beyond the times of Menes, when, how-ever we are assured by many even orthodox Egyptologists, that the races on the Nile had made “great advancement in mathematical skill and all arts and sciences. They had indeed passed through many ages of civilization before the accesion of their first monarch;”2 and if we can imagine what the rude negro Felaheen of these pre-Egyptian days could then have been, some few thousand years will not appear too long for the necessary advancement in “arts and sciences.” But our own impression is, that the Arabian and Negroid element was more rapidly educated up to the Pyramid 1 Cory’s Anct.

These had pushed westward in search of new homes, and naturally tarried on the Aram or Highlands of Arameans and the delta of the Nile, because these were climatically congenial to them. Now if this be any way near the truth, and if the old gods were men, as we believe with Euhemeros the wisely skeptical friend of King Cassander of 320 B.C. they were, then a Saturn or Kronos and his successors, were bona fide men of this Kuthite stock; and through Saturn, Italy and its surroundings were says universal legend, raised from fetish worship to that of a solar deity. After Saturn say numerous ancient writers, Italy and Southern Europe were ruled by his sons and daughters, all too loosely chronicled however as Kronos,1 Pan, Rhea, Demeter, Poseidon Zeus, etc., to be of much use, save to searchers after faith-ideas. For us they are very valuable. But if Euhemeros’ view be accepted that all gods were men, as Egyptians insisted with Herodotos, then we must admit all the “King-gods” of the Nile upon some chronological roll, and thus do away with the so-called “Astromomical period.” Horos and all his predecessors must then be enrolled with Egyptian kings, nay, so must great Pan or Pi-An himself, the Pa, Pha or Phader of his people, whom the priests told Herodotus preceded “the mighty twelve.”2 If the Aithiopians did not spring from “the great Arabian officinum gentes” or human workshop, then they undoubtedly long paused upon that continent on their onward march, and Ouranos or Am-on, one or both, were evidently leaders, who long ruled there. From Am-on in due time sprang Dionusus (Moses’ “God of Nise”), one who personally or as founder of a faith, gave new life to the pure phalik or solo phalik faith which then prevailed over Egpyt, Phenicia and the lands of unborn Pelasgians, Hellenes or Solarists. Diodorus Siculus quoted approvingly from the poem of Phrygia by Thymætes, that Amon was a great monarch of Aithiopinn Arabia, who married Rhea; sister to Saturn or Kronos, the ruler of Italy and adjoining countries. She soon, however, returned to her brother, whom she married, but proved unfaithful to, loving instead one Amal-thea, an Amalathite or Amalakite patriarch (?),3 by whom she had the famous Dionusos of Arabia. Kronos warred with Amon, but was finally defeated by Dionusos, who pursued him westward and slew him, and enthroned Zeus his son in his stead. Who can read this without seeing that the key to the story is the rise, fall and movements of faiths, a rise apparently from pure Amon, or a gross Lingam worship, to a Sivo-Solar faith, as led by Zeus in the West and the God of Nusa in the East; for this very ancient Kuthite Dionusos must not be confused with his later poor Greek imitation—“the dancing, drinking son of Semele.” We are here considering times even prior to Menes, and long before the famous Aithiopian King Kepheus, Kep, or 1 Cory’s Ancient Fragments, ed. Hodges, p. 173. 2 Danet’s Dictionary of Ants., also our Glossary [and Herodotos, Hist. II. 145.] 3 The Bible Chron. on Gen. 36-12, gives 1800 B.C. as the time Jews knew Amaleks.

A Sidon and Tyre of Moon and Sun faith, flourished long before the Tyre of Herodotus of 2760, was founded. Neither Egyptians nor “the father of history” knew aught of the name “Phenicians,” nor indeed did Greeks, till near Christian days. Phenicia and Syria were spoken of as Aithiopia, Sidonia and Arabia, and on and near the Nile, as the “lands of the Caphtorim.” Indeed, “the entire of of Palestine anciently bore the name of Aithiopia, and it was the Aithiopia lying around Jaffa, the ancient Joppa, and no part of Egypt, which Menelaus visited;” but this will have to be fully treated of hereafter.1 At present we are moody concerned to lead up to the early Eastern movements, which led to the establishment of so-called Westem Aborigines, and we must there-fore say a little more as to early Egyptian history, which the reader should be well acquainted with if he would fully appreciate early histories elsewhere. Though Menes was “the first king” known on the records from which Manetho drew his history, yet he was neither necessarily nor probably the real first, for, says M. Renan, “Egypt at the beginning appears mature, old and entirely without mythical and heroic ages, as if the country had never known youth. Its civilization had no infancy, and its art no archaic epoch”: that is, these periods are as yet hid from us, for they must have existed, and as a rule, have occupied a longer period than the age of wealth, power, and civilization, owing to the jealously or avariciousness of neighbouring ruder, but often physically stronger peoples. Bunsen remarks that “the history of Egypt previous to Menes was probably longer than that after his time.” Diodorus said that the people claimed eighteen thousand years for the rule of the gods and heroes, and fifteen thousand for men,2 and Megasthenes wrote that “Osiris or Dionusos, who sprang from these, ruled Egypt six thousand and forty-two years before Alexander’s day,” that is, reigned about 6500 B.C.—an estimate, as Baldwin remarks, “more likely to be too small than too large.” The Greek ambassador claimed a similar great age for a settled Indian monarchy, stating that their Dionusos gave them a detailed list of Indian kings. With reference to this, be it remembered that Sir Gardner Wilkinson thought the great Egyptian race were of Hindoo extraction, entering the Nile valley near to Thebes and gradually civilizing it northwards. “The civilization of Barbara and Meroe,” he says, “long preceded that of Memphis. . . . In the time of Menes all Egpyt except the district of Thebes was a morass. . . . No part of the land now existing below Lake Myris was then above water.3 He lauds Menes for draining a part of lower Egypt, and changing one of the mouths of the Nile. Diodorus more correctly called “the building race Aithiopians or Kuthites, led off by 1 Egyptians called Phenicians Caphtorim. Cf. Prehistoric Nations, 133-4, and Hamilton and Falconer on Strabo.

Geological Changes. 401one Osiris from their Eastern kingdoms to colonize Egypt,” which points to Arabian Himyar or Nejd—the lands of Karn builders and Sabaites—as the home of ancient Aithops and Kuths. Geology also gives a reason for this move. The Nejd or Arabian Highlands had for ages been rising above the level of the ordinary water sources; and lands once rich and fertile, and able to support a large population, had then apparently begun to assume their present arid and barren condition—a geo-climatik change quite sufficient, as a rule, to force all the animal creation to move for-ward en masse. Like cattle, we do not willingly change ground, if the pasturage be good, though stronger races, whose lands are failing them, may drive a weaker and con-tented race onwards. Ancient Arabia was in fact like Central Asia, becoming “a dry and thirsty land,” too high for its water springs. Long ages of thriftless occupiers had also denuded it of wood, and thus checked its rainfall, till its rivers like the Jordan of Syria, and the Oxus and Syrdaria of high Asia, had ceased to reach the sea, or even to run over the highlands, which they had once kept clothed with rich crops and pasturage. On this account the Arabian races kept spreading for ages north into Arabi-Irak or Babylonia where as tower and karn builders, their structures assumed new forms, for there they had to use sun-dried bricks, and preserve these from destruction with bitumen. Others of these tribes turned to the West, where the Nile was, said Diodorus, fast “creating a new world out of the ocean,” whilst others again overspread the Highlands and furthermost wastes and deserts of Suria, where, true to their character, they constructed, as at Balbek, Palmyra and Martu, those gigantic works, the ruins of which continue to astonish even the engineers and architests of these advanced times. Note also that in Martu, or Marthos, we have one of their great capitals named after their earliest Yachaveh or “God of Battles”—their Ars,1 or Mahā-Ars, a “God of Summer Harvests,” or “of the Ear of Corn,” whose representa-tive was also a spike, spear, hair, and the vernal Ram. Tho Bible which Ezra brought out of Kaldia in the fifth century B.C., speaks of these great buildern as “a mighty people,” giants, Rephaim, etc., who occupied all the country from the salt Vale of Siddim to “Dobah on the left hand of Damascus”; and this when Abram was a migrating Arab Shaik twenty centuries B.C., or according to the LXX. and Samaritan chronology, about 2600 B.C. His faith and theirs was alike, for he served Malek-e-Zedik, or the “High El” and later Jove,2 and was the ally of Am-or-ites, worshipping stones, phali, trees or Jovine symbols, and Ur or Fire. Not till the fifteenth century B.C. is it even pretended that the Is-ra-els or other Saturnites, made any impression on this great Aithiopian race, and our Bible maps show us, that even in the so-called distribution of the country among the “Rephaim or giants,” the Aithiops held from “Holy Herman,” the Phalik Olumpos near Damascus, down to distant Jabesh Gilead, a land still full of stone worshippers. 1 J.

Porter thus enthusiastically describes what he saw a few years ago of the works of these so justly-named “Giants,” in contradistinction to the pigmy people who succeeded them: “From a high point I saw at least one thousand square miles of Og’s ancient kingdom spread out before me. There was the country of those giant inhabitants the Eastern kings smote. . . . . There were these ‘three-score great cities’ of Argob, whose walls and gates and brazen bars were noted with surprise by Moses and the Israelites (1300 B.C., or 1500 say some), and whose Kyklopian architecture and massive stone gates even now fill the western traveller with amazement.”1 More than fifteen centuries ago, the historian Ammianus, who accompanied the Emperor Julian in his Eastern campaign, and who as a native of Syria, should have known something of the builders had they belonged to even the Grecian age, con-fesses with simplicity that the “fortresses and strong castles, . . . . numerous towns and some great cities, such as Bostra and Gerasa, encompassed by massive walls,” . . . . were erected by some “ancient inhabitants,” of which nothing is known by him. The Rev. Mr. Porter says that though “the monuments designed by the genius, and reared by the wealth of Imperial Rome are fast mouldering to ruins in this land, that the simple massive houses of the Rephaims are many cases as perfect as if only completed yesterday.” “These were built,” he adds, “by the gigantic Emim and Rephaim, long before the Kaldian shepherd migrated from Ur to Canaan;” that the cities are in fact properly designated “the giant cities of Bashan.” Mr. Marcus Keane, in his Towers and Temples of Ireland, says thcse great builders are the same as those whom Greeks afterwards called Arkadians; and Baldwin says they “are far older than any other races of which there is the slightest trace in the mythologies, traditions, records or old ruins, of which we have any knowledge.” These races were undoubtedly the real and highly-efficient pioneers and instructors of Aryans, then slumbering in their high Asian home. Harcourt writes that “Arkadinns vaunted their antiquities above all other nations, . . . . who assumed the name of Aborigines, . . . . boasting that they were in possession of the land before the birth of Jupiter,”2 which is probable, as Jupiter’s birth was only on the full of Lyceus or Luk-eus, elsewhere fully treated of.3 They constructed arches as we sea in the recess built for Cercs, in the Cavern Temple of Hippa, in Arkadia,4 but at what period is not clear. We know of semi-circular arches amidst the most ancient ruins of Carthage,5 of “innumerable vaults and arches” at Thebes, belonging to an early date,6 and of the abundant use of the arch in the most ancient spccimens of the Etroskan schools;7 which E-tur-ans are held to be the builders of Round Towers or Turs like thooe in Ireland, and to be a swarm from the same hive which sent forth early Kuthites. Others call them a branch of the Pelasgi, but they 1 Giant Cities of Bashan. Lon. 1866. Gen. xiv. 2 Harcourt’s Doc. of Deluge, Keane, p. 201. 3 The Lukean Zeus represented advanced Solarism. Cf.

Now it is clear that the Turanian Aithiopik Cushites could not have sprung at once, nay, nor under a millennium, into such power and advanced civilization. They must have passed through all the usual stages of savagery ere they began to cleave their way among other aborigines: amidst the barren deserts, defiles and forests of the Hindoo Kush (is this old name derived from them?) or the Kaukasian and Taurus or Tur ranges. Long before legendary history makes us acquainted with them, they had founded great cities, excogitated a wondrous nature or elemental worship, and here and there they had passed beyond this to a higher solar faith. They had reared those towers and strange hypethral temples by which we trace their paths along the plains and swamps of the Euphrates, the deserts and highlands of Arabia, and all Western Asia; and, even in Osirian days, they were stretching forwards to greater deeds and a more extended civilization over Apennines and Aps, and all the western lands of later Pelasgian, Ligurian, Bask, and Iberian peoples. They left, as offshoots or remnants, Akadians, Skuths, Burburs or Berbers, to take up their role in Central Asia,2 Himya-rites in Arabia, and Barbas on the adjoining mainland of their Western Erythæum Mare; whilst Pelasgi and Phenecians of half Aithiopik blood ruled along all their old coasts, where their King Kepheus had long reigned. Their Kuthite blood had mingled freely, from their Asian cradle-land to even Pictish Alba, and Skotish Irene, with Turanian, Shemitik, and Aryan stocks; and in this, our islands have reason to rejoice, ere the great old race passed away to make room for still greater peoples. It was undoubtedly Kuthites who rendered possible the Aryan advance, and who played the part of a civilizing Rome, thousands of years before Roma’s birth. It was their vast mythology and strange legends which passed, as Lord Bacon wrote. “like light air into the flutes of Grecians, there to be modulated as best suited Grecian fancies.”3 Indeed, it is manifest from many old writings, that it was their tales, myths, traditions and histories that lay at the base of the Western world’s thought and legendary lore. These so impressed all subsequent races, and entered so deeply and minutely into all Aryan mythologies, that many writers now think Aryans can only claim to have added to the superstructure and complexion of Aithiopian myths and mythical history; and let us remember, that active Aryan life and mythologies began at least 3000 years B.C., when high Asia or Arya-Varta, becoming too cramped for this race, they were pressing southwards to India and Ariana, and to the West generally. Then and there must Aryans have met with Aithiopian civilization, as did 1 Mrs. H. Gray’s Sculp. of Etruria, pp. 16, 266, 238. 2 Rawlinson’s Anct.

They were all builders on old Cushite foundations. The late Asyriologist, Mr. Talbot, and others, informed the Biblical Archeological Society, that “the Greek fable of Aktion and dogs. and numerous tales given by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, the beautiful Myths of Hekate the Queen of Witchcraft, and many others, “had been found stamped upon the tablets of Kaldia,” when these were considered Shemitik records. “We are forced to confess,” said Mr. Talbot, “that all the great deities of antiquity were originally one, viewed in different lights,” because, among other reasons, they sprang from one very religious ancient race. It is a great mistake, he adds, to think that there was not, in the most ancient times, continued literary inter-communication between the most distant nations.1 The roads and passes from the Indus to Baktria, Khiva, Persia and the West, were then precisely what they are still, and we know that before the telegraph wire existed, political and commercial knowledge flitted almost as quickly from town to town throughout these countries as it does in Russia. Neither do dogmas, doctrines and literature generally lag far behind, as Wahābism showed us to our coat some years ago, when Peshawar and Patna hung anxiously on voices issuing from the Arabian Nejd. He whose historical vision is bounded by Greek and Roman literature cannot grasp our subject, but if with such knowledge he can throw mwself into the times of the oldest writers, and add to this the archeological lore which the last century or so has given to us, he will both enter into their labours and reach to far beyond the world which bounded their less mature vision. This little ball in the universe of globes is very much older and grander in its geological, social and religio-historical developments, when these are fully understood, than most ancient and modern writers have believed. We have been far too credulous in regard to the writings favoured by our own priests and teachers, both as to their views and those of the tribes they look upon as sacred, and especially is this the case in our supposititious Genesis of creation. On the other hand, we have been too incredulous of all non-Christian or unsectarian histories, faiths, legends and traditions of foreign peoples, whose movements, if not indeed proven, are yet most apparent from many circumstantial and synchronous inci-dents in the general history of the world. We refuse to consider the edicts of govern-ments, and the records of hostile faiths and dogmas, though day by day substantial proofs are given that these were recorded on stone some six thousand years ago. Yet we readily accept the floating and oral legends going back to about this period, of a little Syrian tribe, with all their impossible stories as to an ancestral Eden which we are unable even to locate in our maps, and complacently accept dates for the supposed events, which we decline even to consider elsewhere; nay, if geologists desire it, we make the Edenik days into Eons, or untold millenniums.

Nevertheless let us here try without bias to consider a few of the many details which ancient Keltik bards and antiquaries have handed down to us regarding Ireland, for it was undoubtedly the home of many immigrations of Kuths, Syths or Scaoths, Skots or Colonizers. IRELAND.—The zeal of early Christians has here done even more irreparable mischief than elsewhere. Patrik and his followers prided themselves on burning three hundred volumes of Irish histories and Druidical writings; “stuft,” said these ignorant Pagans—so-called Christians—“with fables and superstitions of heathen idolatry unfit to be transmitted to posterity.”1 The learned old Toland, quoting this remark in 1718, asks, “But, pray how so; why are Gallik or Irish superstitions more unfit to be transmitted to posterity than those of Greeks and Romans? Why should Patrick be more squeamish in this respect, than Moses and succeeding Jewish prophets? . . . what an irreparable destruction of history, . . . what an unspeakable detriment to learning, what a dishonour upon the human understanding, has this cowardly proceeding of the ignorant, or rather of the interested . . . at all times occasioned! This book burn- ing,” he contintues,” has prevailed in Christianity from the beginning. Even in the Acts of the Apostles we read that “many of them that believed and used curious arts, brought their books together and burnt them before all men; and they counted the price of them and found it 50,000 pieces of silvers,” which the sorrowing Toland esti-mated at £300 in his day, and adds truly, that this apostolik “example has been better followed than any precept of the Gospel.” We have however, many proofs of the existence of ancient Keltik learning and literature beyond the works destroyed by these superstitious vandals. Diogenes Laertius, writing probably in our second century, saya that the Greeks owed much of their legendary lore, theology and philo-sophy to the Kelti or their Magi—great ones or Druids, as well as to Africans, Egyptians and Phrygians. The Keltik literati were known to Greeks as Ouateis, and to Romans as Vates, which our leamed Keltik and classic scholar says is from the Irish word Faidh,2 “a prophet, physician, diviner or wise man.” There were even learned Druidesses, for in the reign of King Laoghaire I whom Patrik is erroneously said to have converted, two young Druidesses distinguished themselves in writing about and arguing down the new religion.3 The absurdities regarding Egypt, the Kaldian, quasi Jewish tales of a Flood, of a Noah, Moses and such like, which are found in some old Irish writings, are justly held to be interpolations by Irish Christian writers, for no Druids could have been guilty of supporting these and what they held to be a false religion, even thongh they heard the legends, as some possibly had. The interpolations were probably the 1 Dr. Kennedy and Toland’s History of Druids, p. 105. 2 Ibid, p. 77, dh or dg = u, or a mere drawl. 3 Ibid, pp. 60, 79. "},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 406irregular acts of bards or Faidhs of the sixth or later centuries, when these officials became “freed from all the restraints of their superiors, the Druids.”1 We have parallel Christian doings in the interpolations in Josephus’ Antiquities, the Sybiline Oracles (where Christ is foretold and even described), in the writings of Tacitus, and, indeed, throughout the Old and New Testaments, canonical and apokryphal. The student and historian have thus to narrowly pick their way amid pitfalls and snares, which beset all research into early faiths and histories. Grote truly says, that our information regarding the ancient world is but part of the wreck of a huge stranded vessel. Yet Irish history is in no way pre-eminent in difficulties and exaggerations and has in many respects superior claims to a very prominent place; for we are over-whelmed with ancient stories, and everwhere see signs of early intellectual activity. Ireland, says Keating, “maintained when all Europe was utterly ignorant and brutal two hundred principal analists and historians from national grants of land;” and besides this, every nobleman of any quality retained one or more bards or learned writers. It is their writings that Patrik & Co. tried to destroy, and which the ignorant fanatiks of “the Dark Ages” still more stringently searched out and burned; yet there remained some learned and wise men, for Mosheim states that even the dark ninth century left to Ireland wany “men of acute parts and extensive knowledge, well entitled to be called philosophers.” Scotus was such a man, and Gildas then studied in Irish institutions “the highest form of philosophy and literature,” and “Saxons flocked to Ireland from all places, as the emporium of letters.” Irish native faith or theosophic thought appears indeed to have thriven as it willed, and pretty much undisturbed from many centuries B.C. till the Dark Ages; but in its old age it was perturbed by a sickly, and superstitious Christianity, which, for centuries adopted the ways of the old faith, though gradually stifling the literature and advancing thoughts of a race peculiarly bright and sparkling, when relieved from the incubus of dogmatic teaching. Not till the middle of the twelfth century, when the English king Henry II. invaded the iland, was there any decidedly forcible foreign suppression of Keltik faith and old rites attempted by a united Christian government. Up to this time the Christian priests had really only acted upon the fears and superstitions of the “kings” of counties and their officials. During all the occupation of Britain by Romans and the dis-turbances and wars which ever harassed the continent, “the Green Isle” was left to slumber peacefully, principally because of its situation. Roman genarals did not like distant oceans, and reported the Irish shores to be very dangerous, and the iland of little value. Tacitus relates that “Melius or Hibernia was, prior to the times of Agricola better known to commerce than the ports of Britain;”2 but then the merchant sailors of those days were the talented Phenicians. In Roman times Ireland was the resting-place of all the pious and oppressed, especially from Britain, 1 Dr. Kennedy and Toland’s History of Druids, Notes, p. 267. 2 Prehistoric Nations, p. 381 et seq."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Ireland’s Earliest Races and very Advanced Culture. 407Fig.283.—THE SILVER HAND ON SUN,CARVED ON CROSSES, CO. LOUTH. Iberia and Armorika—lands of Keltik brethren. No wonder it became a store-house of Keltic writings. One of the best works which Ireland now possesses in print (it has apparently much hidden away in MSS.) is “The Annals of the Kingdom,” compiled in English and Irish by “the four masters” or four learned monks, whom a nobleman employed for this purpose in the sixteenth century. From these seven quarto volumes, and other such writings, we gather that the first Irish immigrants were Formorians, or Formoraghs, perhaps from the Keltik Form-ho-raice or Fom’oraig-Afraic, who are said to have come form the West, and some of them by way of Arabia and Iberia. They therefore seem to have been a Hamitik or Kutho-Phenician people, and to have belonged to that great Cyclic wave which our chart shows as having carried, accord-ing to Jewish tradition, “the Father of the Faithful” from Ur to Hebron. These Formoraghs long held their own against all comers, and hence are called Aborigines or Fir-muighe, “the men of the land.” They were apparently serpent, tree and fetish worshippers, but were esteemed Kuldees by later rude and unsettled invaders, as we see the Chaldees became the wise men and astrologers of Baby-lonians in and before the days of the Beltshazar legend;1 for as before shown it is a law or natural sequence, that the older settled peoples, became the Magi and priests to their ruder conquerors. The Formoraghs fought their first invaders, the Parthalons, both by sea and land for thirty years, and slew their leader of that name, after which occurred an invasion of Neimhedhs, probably solarists, who also were finally routed in a great naval battle, at which “the Formoraghs had sixty ships and a strong army.” The Neimhedhs fled to Britain, after which Ireland is said to have had “perfect peace for four hundred years,” when three powerful tribes of Fir-Bolgs successfully invaded, but only held it for a generation or so, and under nine kings, who divided it into fove Principalities, which have remained very much the same down to these days, except that Munster embraces two of these. The Tuatha-de-Danā-ans, or “Tribe of Danāans,” were the next invaders, and they appear to have had a considerable civilization, and to have easily subdued the Fir-Bolgs, whom some call “the men of Bol or Bel.” The crowning battle of the Danān king Madha, “of the silver hand,” had been much celebrated by Irish bards and “after it the land had again rest for two hun-dred years.” Petrie and others say that both Fir-Bolgs and Danāns were good builders, constructing dome-roofed houses and sepulchres of stone without cement, and in the style usually called Kuklopian or Pelasgik.2 The royal symbol of the Danān dynasty was this sacred emblem of the silver hand, fig. 283, specimens of which are still to be found in 1 Daniel v., 25. 2 Cf.

The Eastern signification of the ideograph is, the conjunction of sun and moon, or male and female nature. Some-times the Siviak hand is golden as in the emblems of Zoroaster, see p. 488 of Vol. I. The ignorant, determined as usual to try and account for what had faded from the memories of the people, said that the silver hand-emblem had been adopted because the first king had lost his hand in battle, and an artificer, Creidne, had affixed a silver one in lieu, but we give elsewhere more important and significant reason. During the reign of the ninth Danan king, the Milidh or Milesians Spanish Kelts, who had long traded with Ireland, invaded and finally conquered the whole island, having been induced thereto by the hatred with which they saw the native inhabitants theb regarded the Danans. These Milidhs, who very possibly as some urge, came west via Miletus, appear to have been the first Aryan Kelts who reached this remote Ultima Thule, and were doubtless the van of the great Aryan horde which our chart shows was surging here and there from the seventeenth to eighteenth century B.C. “The Four Masters” give 1700 B.C. as the date of this Keltik invasion, so that we thus arrive at the following rough approximation of Irish Prehistorik Chronology:— B.C. ——? ——?

There are “detailed lists of Irish dynasties” which profess to fill in these great blanks historically, and to bring down a list of rulers from about 2300 B.C. to Bishop Patricius of 432 A.C., or for over two thouasnd seven hundred years, and no doubt they are as truthful as most of those so-called histories, “sacred and profane” belonging to the same distant periods, whether of Jewish or Grecian peoples. On the whole we may agree with the learned author of Prehistoric Nations, who here fairly enough urges, that “without accepting either the dates, the glosses or ethnical specu-lations of the later Irish writers, we must admit that the general outline and main facts of Irish history furnished by the old records of the country, cannot be reasonbly discredited or shown to be improbable; but on the contrary, that they are in harmony with what we know or may reasonably presume, concerning Westem Europe in pre-historic times.” We know that the armies of Egypt, under the great eighteenth or Thothmic Dynasty, had in the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries, swept over all Phenicia and Syria, and successfully met the trained phalanxes of Asyria, and pene-trated to even ancient Yemen; bringing back from all these countries rich trea- sures of art and commerce, which proclaimed a past civilization in old Aithiopian "},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Early Western Races and their Eastern Faith Emblems. 409and Phenician kingdoms, there scarcely yet surpassed. These Egyptian armies had gradually overthrown and dispersed all the old Eastern Pelasgik, and Kefat or Phenician civilizations, which had therefore pressed westwards to Italy, Spain, Gaul, and no doubt Britain and Irene. Throughout these therefore, new cities now sprang up, yet were not the old centres quite forsaken. As warring hosts withdrew, a new Tyre, Tur or Tsur, arose upon the ruins of that of 2700 B.C., dedicated to Melkarth or Herakles; and by the Pillars of this, their solar god, the same races now laid or increased the foundations of Tartissus, and Gadir or Cadiz, as well as Massilia or Marseille. Indeed, no part of maritime Europe to as far north as the regions of the ancient Cimmerii or mythic Hyperborei—by their Ogygia or Umbilicus Maris, was neglected by the enterprising and disturbed hosts. Equally religious as intelligent, and actualted by the love of gain and new lands, these Phenician or mixed races pressed forward, often crossing all seas and settling on all coasts, but only making conquests here and there where the exigences of their trade and religion required this. They got inextricably mixed up with Kuths or Skuths, Turhenians, Pelasgi, Kelts and Kimmerii, and we need not therefore wonder at discovering in every quietish corner of Europe, especially in Skandinavia, Ireland and the recesses of Bask or Iberian Highlands, emblems of those Eastern faiths, which though very anciently born on the table-lands and steppes of Asiatik Obo-ists and Karnites, had been nursed in the lofty mountain shrines of Ariana, and in the wild recesses of Kaukasia, but which had attained to a rich or rather gross maturity amidst the effeminate influences of Phrygia, Ionia, Samothracia and other ilands lying in the sweet, soft bosom of their Pontus Pelagus. Knowing all this, it seems wonderful that, as yet, we have only discovered a very few distinct or undisguised emblems of the once universal god, Mahā-Deva. One is known to us through that indefatigable and learned antiquary, General Vallancey, and appears as fig. 278 on p. 383 ante, and else- where. The General truly calls it “a Bal-fargha or great phallus,” the Bal-Peor of Shemites, the Phala-argha of Hindoos and the Pelarga of Pelasgians, to whom says Pausanias, “no victim was offered but a female recently covered and impregnated.”1 Westerns have generally termed these emblems Buds or Boos, this being the vulgar Keltik for the membrum genitale—the Arb or Arab of Arabia,2 and ignorantly con-nected this Bud worship with Budha and Budhism, or cultivation of wisdom; and truly modern Budhism has in certain places, given good cause for this unjust aspersion on the faith and pure life of the pious ascetik. But there is no real connection except through the original root, as “that which penetrates or pierces” subjective1y, like keen intellect or argument, and objectively, as does the goad or pricker of the herds-man, and the Bod-kin. or little bod, of the housewife. This Irish Bal-fargha, Bud or Muidh, was found by Vallency on the very sacred ile of Muir or Inis muidri, which Christians early seized and dedicated to 1 Vallencey’s Pros. Dict. Anct.

Saints Molas and Columba. The present cells or chapels which adjoined the Lingam, belonged said Petrie, to the sixth century, though he admits that their masonry is precisely like that of the old Kuthic buildings. The Bud stood on a raised platform, precisely like those on which Lingams still stand throughout India, and was surrounded by a wall 10 feet high, and having sides 180 × 100 feet long, reminding us of many Indian Linga enclosures. As these subjects, and Asiatik faiths generally, have become better and more widely understood, so archæologists of large sympathies have more intelligently and widely sought out and found, remnants of the old faiths, and these are now every where starting into notice. Thus Professor Holmboe, of the Royal University of Norway, gives abundant evidence of the worship throughout Odin’s ancient kingdom of Lingaik, and Yonik stones, or as he calls them, Budhistik conical and ovicular lithoi.1 He traces these to their old sites near to ancient Stupas, blunted spires, and tumuli, and shows their exact correspondence with the phalik emblems of India and Tibet. He particularly dwells upon three marble Lingams now in the Bergen Museum which were con-sidered holy up to the hour of their removal. One here given was dug out of a sacred Haug in the island of Donoe, and is three feet long and nineteen inches in diameter, and coarse and rude in the extreme, showing how far behind Indians these Northerns were alike in skill and modesty. One Lingam is said to be in l’image d’un dieu, and had, like the Venus of the Morbihan, been consigned “dans le fleuve voisin,” by command of a bishop, because he found it an “objet de veneration pour les Lapons.” Another used to crown the summit of a Haug, and was two feet in diameter and two feet high, “rounded off at the summit;” but the tutelary deity of these parts and of Upsal, was says Professor Holmboe, Fricco or Fray, whose images in wrought-silver amulets, the inhabitants used here to wear upon their persons just as Hindoos wear symbols of Siva and Vishnoo, and as Italians wore Phali and Yoni. Up to 1857, only one Skandinavian image of Fray had been found, and it—mounted on a square plinth like that at Inis Muidhr, stood in the cell of one of the numerous haugs on the same island of Donoe, off the coast of Helgeland.2 The neighbouring mariners said it was an emblem of Frey, and able to grant miraculous favors, especially to sailors, for it commanded the winds and the waves. These Lingams were “covenant-gods,” like the galeed of Jacob, the temple pillar of Josiah, and the Jupiter Fœderis of Latins, before which solemn oaths were made or ratified. Numerois ovicular “hen-egg stones,”3 strange gems and charms having a play of colour such as Hindoos also use, have been found in and about the Haugs, and on the 1 Traces de Budhism, en Norvege, par M.

The Skandinavian still calls the “holy tree” near to Haugs the Bu or bou-træ-haug, as the Boodhist calls his the Bo-drum. Thus the old faith of Odin’s land is the same as that of India—a truly Bod or Bud worship in the sense of the “thorn god, Piercer or Divider,” and closely connected with Bod-en or Wod-en, probably as father and child, but having no connection whatever with the original philosophic faith of Sakya Muni, “The Budha” or Searcher after Wisdom. IRISH ROUND TOWERS.—It will now be useful to notice, for the benefit of those who have not had leisure to study the voluminous literature regarding “The Round Towers of Ireland,” some facts there elicited, and this we will do by taking Mr. George Petrie as the able expositor of the so-called orthodox side, which argues that these are ecclesiastical buildings of early Christian Irishmen and Albans. Mr. Petries’ prin-cipal work is “The Round Towers of Ireland, their Origin and Uses.” Dublin, 1845. In his preface he acknowledges he is not sanguine that what be submits in these large and important tomes, will do much to convince “the great majority of the middle classes of the Irish people into changing their opinions as to the indefinite antiquity and Pagan uses” of the round towers. He adds, that “the lower or agri-cultural classes have no ideas upon the subject but the true ones,” which is an admission that the cultivated opinion of Ireland is, that the towers belong to Pagan times and to its most ancient faith, and this is still true. Writers and archæologists of the most divergent views in other matters, seem here agreed, that the oldest of the structures and their adjoining cells, are in close accordance with what we find in many other old countries as the works of the great builders variously styled Kuklops, Aithiops or Cushites. Even Mr. Petrie acknowledges the structural similarities, but like other writers on his side, knowing nothing of the rites and other outward manifestations, far less of the esoterik ideas of Phalik, Fire and Sun worship, more especially of Sivaism, so rampant all over Asia about the period these towers were probably built, he and those following him cannot possibly comprehend, or at least see the force of such writings as those of Vallency, Higgins, Bryant, Inman, Marcus Keane, etc. Mr. Petrie probably did not even know a single rite, nay perhaps not even the name of Sivaism, for he does not devote a page to the considerntion of this vastly ramified faith, and its acknowledged Keltik connection. Out of the one thousand pages composing his work, we find only a few lines sneering at what is called the “absurd hypothesis of the towers having been Phalli or Priapeia Templa.” The author forgets, 1 Holmboe, p. 49.

Mr Petrie says that the learned Sir William Betham was a zealous supporter of the Phalik hypothesis, although he had read all his (Mr. P.’s) writings, and Sir William is only one of a very numerous and learned company, well fitted to decide, and who have decided, that the Irish structures are of “Phenician, Indo-Skuthian, or Eastern origin.”1 To the honored names of such formidable antagonists as Jacob Bryant, Vallancy, George Higgins and others, Mr. Petrie adds as on the same side, such skilled and learned Irishmen as Drs. Lanigan and O’Conor, D’Alton, O’Brien, Moore, Beauford, Windele. etc., and to this list we might add many modern authors in. Europe and America. The gross ignorance of Sivaik lore displayed in most of the arguments brought forward by Petrie and his supporters, is truly astonishing, and the errors made are too numerous to attempt detailed refutation. All that can be here urged is, that doubters must studiously read up Eastern faiths if they would understand this subject. The reader should refer to our Indexes for fuller information regarding these Irish towers, and to the Glossary under such heads as Aph, Kal, Gall, Sith or Seth, Kill or Ceal, etc. Many are the names scholars give to the towers, but the consensus of opinion inclines to terms significant of fire, stones and bells, as cuil-ceach, c-ceac, cul-kak, clog-theach, cluig-theach, etc. Vallency’s arguments are on the lines of ceal and kill, the Tamil, Coil or Koil, a fire-cell or shrine. As he says, a ceil or cuil is the place of burning or holy fire, and ceile-di or Culdee (a Chaldian) one who preserves or tends the fire in the Cuil, or as Dravidians still do, in their coils; see Glossary, Kill, etc.2 Kăl is still in Tamil “a stone,” a vulgar name for the Lingam and a Pillar, as the fiery god’s symbol; and note that Cushites, Kuths or Aithiops lived in Tamil countries, and travelled even further east than west. Much evidence goes to show that they were those early pre-Aryan Caucaisnas or Kā-kusis who founded the Dravidian kingdom if not race of Southern India, and who passing onwards, probably built the very ancient city of Ongkor Thom, and great temple of Ongkor Vâht, or as others name it, Nak-non-Vat, “the Serpent Protector,” on the borders of Kamboja and Siam, so fully noticed in our first vol., pp. 112-115. There they still are known as Khmérs or Khmerdoms, or “original Khmêrs” or Kuys, as the Kambojans call them according to Mr. Keane, an able writer on Caucasian or Indo-Chinese Races—a sufficiently startling cognomen.3 Mr. Keane lays down as a well-established truth that 1 Vol. i., p. 106, and sec. ii., p. 11.

Their Wide Eastern Range. 413these Caucasiams “have from prehistoric times occupied the Indo-Chinese peninsula,” and he is well supported by several French anthropologists, who see them in nearly all the non-Mongol races of Indo-China. They too doubtless, built the magnificent old temples of Java, which Aryan Hindoos and Boodhists repaired or again built over; as the great Boro Bodor Pyramid, now covered with “thousands of years of elaborate bas-reliefs,” and the huge shrine which once stood on the ruins of Ayuthia in Siam, and possibly some of the oldest and un-Barmese-like ruins, still scattered over the plains of Pagān on the Irawady. Gradually these wondrous Caucasians dwindled away as they advanced north-east into Western China, where however they are still recognisable in Yunan. They also pushed their way eastward into Oceana, where Mr. Keane says “the large brown race of Eastern Polynesia (our Sawaiori) consists still exclusively of these Caucasian elements.” The Caucasian Khmerdoms or Kuys are held to have been the first settlers in Kamboja, and the Kams or Chams, were another colony of the same, whose name is very suggestive of their early solo-phalik god Am, and their own western name Hamites or Chamites. M. Bouillevaux, in his L’Annane et le Cambodge, calls these Khmêrs “White Savages of Caucasian type.”1 But to continue the subject in hand, viz., the ancient towers which this race probably built in Ireland. If it be argued that these were belfrys, and belong to the days of early hand-bells, this by no means vitiates the Phalik theory, for the bell has ever been considered by Easterns as the appropriate symbol of the noisy or passionate god of fire. We have already pointed out how holy bells used to be hung on Phali as at Nismes, and at page 300 how Phali were engraved upon them, as at St. Falans’ shrine, near the source of the Tay in Perthshire; also that Kelts and Christians alike adored bells, and consecrated or baptized them as symbols of Māya or Mary, the consort of the fiery phalik god. Parvati signifies “the hill,” Ark or Om-phi-an goddess, whom Persians and Irish Kelts had alike honored with fires on hills and “high places.”2 As Zerdusht, the golden-handed solarist of Persia, is said to have perished by the spear of a Turanian Skuth, so the Danā-an King of Ireland, Nuada Airgiod-lamh “of the silver hand” (clearly a Lunarist, as so many Irish were), perished fighting the Irish Fir-bolgs “in the year 2787” A.M., or 1267 B.C., a date which though some- times smiled at as given by one O’Flaherty, yet fits in remarkably well with Phenician history. The second Irish colony of Nemedians, says Petrie, who came from Greece “after the deluge,” had “a certain Draoi, or Druid, named Midhgha, who lighted the first fire for them in Meath, which is said to have thence received its name from him. . . . All were obliged to pay him and his successors tribute for the liberty of lighting their fires annually from this original fire, . . . and this was pexpetuated long after the introduction of Christianity,” and is the real old Kabirian or Gueberi faith. It is also the pure Parsiism of to-day, and as no true Christianity existed among the masses till the eighth century, and the sacred fire continued to be lit and reverenced 1 Journ. Anthrop.

"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 414till a century or so ago,1 the ancient phalo-Fire faith of Ireland and its Tower development, is clear enough. Pennant describes similar fire-worship and towers among the Poligars of India; Hanway among the Guebres of Persia; Vallency among the Bulgarians on the Volga, where the Aire-Coti, or Irish Kelts, appear to have once had a settlement under Casair, and in the country of “the Kisti and Ingushti,” very ancient nations of the Kaukases, where most of the villages have “a Round Tower.” Similar facts are known to most persons who have read or travelled much. The English antiquary Beauford is very distinct in his description of the Irish fire rites and towers, and states that these are similar to those existing in Asia. He derives the Keltik name of these Irish towers (Cloghadh, or Klogha) “from Tlachgo, or Tlacht, the earth or universe,” saying that they were “Druid temples of Vesta, or Cybele, in which were kept the sacred and eternal fire;” that they were “of the same construction as the Pyrathea of Persians and the Chammia (Ham-ia, or Am-onia) of the Phenicians and Carthagenians, . . . usually constructed of rock-stone, without cement”; that “after the establishment of Christianity in Ireland, among a number of Druidic superstitions the sacred fires were preserved for several centuries; . . . that the Tlachos, or Temples of Vesta, were gradually appropriated by the Christian clergy and surrounded with their ecclesiastical structures, so that they should appear as appurtenances to the churches and monasteries; (and that) on the abolition of these fires about the twelfth century, and the introduction of bells, the Tlachos were in general converted into belfries, whence their modern name Clogh.” The author is inclined to grant that some of the Irish towers now standing, belong only to the period from 600 to 1200 A.C., and that the use of them as belfries died out about 1500. He says there was a great revival of fire-worship about the third and fourth centuries A.C., when Magi, or Gäurs (Aur = fire), spread widely over Europe, carrying censers of sacred fire in their hands, and vowing that their God would again destroy all other faiths. Though Europe as a whole rejected this fresh propagandism, yet wherever Druidik superstitions were then still strong, a revival of Bel-teinism took place. The learned Dr. Lanigan also says that the clergy, always ready to press existing superstitions into their service, “erected a church wherever a. round tower was, though not vice versâ.” And on the same principle, we observe that they countenanced the offering of sacrifices and oblations beside the old stones and in the “Holy-woods.” It is confessed by Dr. Petrie that no Irishmen could or did build stone structures with cement, till long after the first introduction of Christianity, and the natural conclusion is, that Asiatiks, Southerns or the Phenician colonists were here the tower builders and fire missionaries. Mr. Marcus Keane, writing his valuable volume, The Towers and Temples of Ireland in 1867, with all previous works beore him, comes to the con-clusion that the old buildings in question “were created for heathen worship several hundred years B.C.,” . . . that the Christian Irish were guiltless of stone structures till 1 Petrie’s Round Towers, i. 27-28."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"The Towers as Solo-Phalik-Fire Shrines and Emblems. 415about the twelfth century A.C., though there are a good many specimens of fine Irish architecture which may date back to the fifth century A.C., or rather before the time of the first Patrik. Thus then, all the oldest stone works belong to Kelts and old Keltik faiths, and what Mr. Keane thus establishes for Ireland, Colonel Forbes Leslie proved is equally the case in regard to many of the old structures of Scotland. See his Ancient Races written in 1866. Moreover he informed the writer about ten years later, that he would then have written still more strongly, his studies having assured him of many more confirmatory facts. In Lough Neagh, which submerged much of its extensive area in the first century A.C., fishermen show to strangers, says Mr. D’Alton, some Round Towers (“Religious Towers” they call them) far beneath the waters. There is no explaining away such facts. See even Petrie, p. 42. And when we remember that Kelts and the old races of Europe came from Asia, and espcially from the strongholds of the Persian Magi and the solo-fire-worshippers of Ariana and Media, where the races built towers as emblems of their faith, preserving in them the sacred fire of their God and worshipping around them, is it not natural to suppose that those who left these regions, and probably sprang from them and held the same faith, and who there learned the building arts of Asia, should have carried their faith and arts to their new homes, and continued to so exhibit their religion, until the masses adopted Christianity to the suppression of solo fire-worship? It was Persian Kelts and Phenicians, who, says the Irish antiquary Moore quoted by Petrie, “introd.uced shaped idols, displacing in many parts of Ireland, as seen in the Krom-Kruach, the worship of rude stones,” or Lingas. The towers represented, says Windele in his History of Cork, “the Hindoo Lingam-like form of the pillar of Simeon the Stylite.” The round hollow tower, adds O’Brien, “was that of a cupboard to hold those figures sacred to that very indecent deity, the Indo-Irish Budha,” and in this he is supports by Dr. Lanigan, D’Alton, Beaufort, and Moore.1 The reader of these works will notice the error, so common with purely European writers, of identifying this Kelto-phalik Budha with “The Budha,” of India, and even with previous Budhas. The advocates of the Christian origin of the towers have long sought in vain for any prototype of them. Even bell are too modern inventions for the objects they desire to make into belfries; and their erection for the ringers of the old hand-bells is too too palpable a quibble for the most bigoted to openly announce. Another significant name of these, was Tur-aghan Ancoire, or “Anchorite Fire-Towers,” for each had its Koil-de, or fire-priest, that is its Kuldee, or temple anchorite, who tended the fire and divine symbol or Fidh. So we still daily see the Koil-dees of Madras watching over their Koils, or Phalik fire-shrines,2 in that old Dravidian land where Cuthites or Colchians lived, and doubtless taught the arts of building which Tamulians and the old Dāsyas of India excelled in and taught their Aryan masters.3 1 Petrie, ii., 69. 2 See Glossary, Fidh, Fiv, fiu, a form of Pi, the male oracle. 3 Cf. Glossary, Dāsyas and Vedantas, etc. [Faiths of Man, s.v. “Dāsa, Dāsya” and “Vedas.”]"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 416The Tuatha de Danān, are acknowledged by Petrie to bave been great builders, and Mr Windele seems to identify them with both the Pelasgi and Egyptians, holding that the arch was known to them, inasmuch as it is found “in the great pyramid and other tombs of a date reaching as high as 1540 B.C., and in Etruskan works, as the gates of Pestum, Volterra, the Cloaca Maxima, etc.” The sloping Egyptian doorways are also common in the very oldest of Irish ruins; so we conclude that Kuthites built the monu-ments of Brugh on numerous mounds, the Karn-Ail, Al, Al or “Stone Carn” (of the Al-god), the prison or cell of Liach-Macha (stone of M.), the pillar stone of Buide (the Lingam or Bud, of Kelts), the stone of Benn, etc.1 Petrio tells us, quoting Harris, a student of The four Masters, that not very long ago an anchorite inhabited a cell quite similar to the cells still seen near to the Round Towers, and this agrees with the practice of Indian Saniyāsis, who invariably live in a cell, hut or cave adjoining their shrines.2 The Abbot of Clonmacnoise retired to and perished from pestilence in such a cell in 987, and from this and similar cases we see that the very name Turris, or tower, came to be used for a penance—a transition from object to subject, the ever frnitful cause of philological difficulty in following up the rites and myths of faiths. It matters not that the proper Irish word for a penance is “aith-righe— a Skytho-Keltic word signifying literally compunction or sorrow,” as Petrie points out. To “take up the staff” is to become a Hâdjee or Pilgrim, and also “to perform a penance,” just as one of our rites of worship is called a “churching.” So in Asyria the name for God, Il, Ilu, El or Al, came to stand for a town, because to go to a town was to go to the buildings which are clustered around the shrine or Ilu of the tribe. Indian languages give many similar instances, as in Oor, Ore, Ur, etc., a town. It is not to be believed that one or several Patriks—and there were several and no one historical saint—converted all the Irish people. If it has taken the whole missionary efforts of Europe and America for one and a-quarter century, to convert 500,000 Indians out of 250,000,000 over whom England has held para-mount sway, and has through her various missions spent from a half to a million sterling annually, we may safely conclude that four or five centuries at least would be required by the Patriks and their weakly following, for the conversion of Ireland; so that not till the tenth century can the iland be called Christian, and even then only in name. The natural increase of the population has with us as with India, had very much more to do with missionary success than dogma or conversions. In India the annual number of so-called real or adult convrts may literally be counted on one’s fingers, whilst the births are in thousands, so that even grunting there were several saints—Patrick, Columba, Kevan, etc.—their utmoat efforts must have been about as infinitesmal as that of a few Christian missionaries dwelling at the outskirts of one of the cities of China, India, Java, etc. The bigotry would be about equal, for the Skoti of Ireland and Scotland were intensely wedded to their dear old 1 Petrie, i. 101.   2 Ibid., 113."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Probable Date and Progress of Christianity in Ireland. 417nature worship, its rites and customs. Their country was very difficult to traverse and the people rude, fierce and blood-thirsty. The new faith had up to the eighth century also, only a few centres and these amidst jealous home and foreign enemies. The first “Saint Patrick” or “Holy Father” was evid.ently one Palladius, who began about 450 to preach Christianity. Various Patriks followed from Britain and Armorika, but even the Catholic priest, J. F. Shearman, writes that he is forced to give up the idea that there ever was a real St Patrick.1 Thus the name must be accepted only in its Fatherly sense, and with the fall of “the man Patrick” all the miraculous and sudden conversions of the kings, lords and commons of Ireland, must vanish. There is no historical account of any church having been fathered upon St. Patrik says even Petrie, nor does history or tradition mention that any such were erected.2 Tillemont and Lanigan “give up the whole account recorded regarding the relation of St Patrik, as of no authority,” and the same must he said of nearly every old Irish Saint. Of the famous St Kevin, who is fabled. to have died about 550. we have only a history of his life belonging to the twelfth century, full of utterly absurd miracles and legends. Even the eccleaiastical edifices fathered upon him are said to have been due to angels, with whom he was in the constant habit of communing. One strong fact comes out very clearly amidst these stories, viz., that all the old saints and their flocks had an intense fondness for “holy stones,”3 wells, trees and staffs, pointing more to the oldest than the latest of faiths. As church plundering and desecrating was very common in Ireland up to the end of the ninth century, it is clear that the faith could not then have had much hold on the superstitious fears of this strangely superstitious people. True criticism is steadily reducing the ages of Irish ecclesiastical ruins. The famous ones at Rathyne, which priests said belonged to 550, we are now told only date from about 800. Dr. Petrie says “he cannot find an abbot, not to say a bishop, of the See of Rathyne till 763,”4 The celebrated Clon-macnoise churches were said to have been first heard of in 758, but the “Records” stating this are now found to be not very trustworthy, and to belong only to the twelfth century, though some priests argue for the year 1015. The famous “Registry Documet” only belongs to the fourteenth century, and gives no good evidence why we should believe that it says in regard to the eighth century. In 945 “the tower (cloic-teach), with croizer (cross staff) and stone (stone?) were all burned and destroyed,” showing that this so sacred central Irish shrine, must even then have existed in a hostile or pagan land. Dr. Sedwich says the fine cross belongs only to the year 1280.4 Irish tower and fire worship, on the contrary, go further back the more the subject is probed. The acknowledged Kuklopian, Etruskan and Phenician structural details, the popular 1 See London Athen., November 1879, reviewing his work, Loca Patriciana. 2 Petrie’s Round Towers, p. 161. 3 Ibid., pp. 188, 193. 4 Ibid., p. 240. 5 Ibid., pp. 245, 368.

Here, as in Asia, they simply imaged the forms in which He manifested His creative or fiery phalik energy in fertilising the uni-verse. Now, of this faith, Mr. Petrie and most Europeans who have not seen and studied the old religions, could not get the key, or where hearing of it, could not understand ita use; and hence this able author of so much otherwise good Irish archæological matter, when his attention is drawn to the constant presence of trefoils, dogs, serpents, etc. (in an island devoid of serpents), confesses, with naïve simplicity, “I am unable to offer any elucidation of them”!3 But not to master the picture-language of an old faith, is simply not to know it, for old faiths were preached, nay taught by pictures even in Christian times, as witness the Budhist Jatakas, and similar picture literature long current among the churches of Europe, not to mention theatrical representations held with very similar objects. Even in the “Dark Ages,” when Christianity having risen to power, waged cruel war against all learning and science—those dark days when Rome confessed, in a council of 992, “none knew the first element of letters,” when no Spanish priests could read, and Alfred of England said, “no priest understood even his Latin prayers”—up to and during all this period, pictorial representation was the leading literature of the faith. Those therefore, who cannot read the symbolism and even see behind its veil where the masses are deceived or ignorant, should not attempt to write about the faith, and especially not of archælogy. Had our good author only understood but a very little of the Sivaite worship and symbolism even of Greece and adjoining coasts, he would certainly not have penned the ten pages from 55 to 65 of this volume, as these establish indubitably what he labours to disprove, that the Round Towers—here fidh-neihedhs, were sacred or “Heavenly Joves,” Eidhs, Fi-s or Pi-s, “Witnesses” or “Trees of the Sanctuary.” The Tree, the gnomon, the thing to witness on, be it wood or stone, a tower, pillar, or the euphemistik thigh, the I-R-K of Hebrews, on which Abram’s and Isaac’s servants swore, are all alike in this faith. Most appropriately indeed, though it upsets his argument, does Dr. Petrie call our attention here to Virgil’s Fidh-nemhedh, in his account of the destruction of Troy, as well as the prayerful waiting of the woman of Lemnos upon this there mountain oracle.

Gobban. 419It is only contended by Petrie that Irish Christians used cemented stone1 at the earliest in 813, and that only during the tenth century, did they manage to construct certain towers like to those of the Pagans, and sundry small Kuils, Koils, Kills, or cells. These last are wretched little hovels about the size of a double horse-box, usually 16 × 9 feet, and only 9 feet high. During the seventh and eighth centuries a Dam- liag (now contracted to Duleck) was a “stone home,” and a thing of considerable im-portance, which the Christians were proud of, and called, in the tongue of their Latin pastors and masters, an Eclaise, Regles, Templum, Baslic or oratorium. Such a cell is seen standing next to a tower, and marked ii. in our fig. 253, p. 268, vol. ii. Even Bangor was proud of then having such an oratorium lapidem. Saint Kevin’s cills or “kitchens” of the sixth century or probably later, though with gable ends, were but cells near to the Tor, Tur, Ail or sacred stone. A compound of this last word Ail or Oil, the Ar or Al of Scotch Kelts, is another instance of how faith-words grow. To go at unusual times to the sacred Oil or al, was a “penance,” and if distant, “a pilgrim-age” or Ail-ithré, from itri-allam, “to go round the Oil;”2 for all old races circum-ambulated their shrines in worship, chanting their circle of “cyclic hymns.” The old round towers are mentioned in the sixth and seventh centuries, and the Pharos, Pur-gos, Tur or Pur, as Phenicians called the phalik sun or pura-midal fire-sign, were then not uncommon names for them.3 The greatest Christian architect of Ireland, say some ecclesiastics, was one Goban-Saer, but he confined his talents to wooden churches, and Petrie thinks, belonged to the seventh century, though popular tradition ascribes to him a tower which Saint Mochaoi, a contemporary of a St. Patrik of 496, seems to have known. This story breaks down however under another tradition, apparently the truest, viz., that Goban did not belong to Christian times at all but was a foreigner of that “goodly dark race, so superior to the Scoti or ancient Irish in their knowledge of the arts;” nay, that he was “a Danāan belonging to the retinue of their king, ‘Leigh of the Long’ of 2764 A.M..” or, say, middle of the thirteenth century B.C.4 A great deal of controversy has arisen regarding this Goban-Saer, and we must therefore look a little at his charac-teristics, for these mythical old Saints are usually found to be demi-gods of the Hercules or Siva-type. Some call Goban a Danāan monarch of the thirteenth century, others say that was “a rusty, large, black youth of that goodly dark race,” and a poet as well as a sage—in fact, a seer, skilled in all artificer’s work, scenic and pictorial. But there were about ten “Gobban Saints,” for Gobban was revered by Christians as well as all Pagan Irishmen, and no old name is even now mpre universally known and esteemed.5 His father was called Traigh Tuiribi, or Traigh, “the living God” or sovereign. Gobban became a Saint Abban in Cork, and is said to have founded the Abbey of 1 Petrie’s Round Towers, p. 151. 2 Ibid., p. 115. 3 Ibid., p. 373.

Of course, she, like her lord, would be dark—a black Venus, corresponding to the early mother of the Nile, and the black virgins of Rome and Paris. Strange that though the architect and his science are acknowledged, yet Irish writers state that all their holy sculpturings, and even Goban’s “round towers,” were miraculously constructed in one night, for what the gods will, springs forth at once, and so it is even now in India, especially in the ease of great images and idols. The Etruskan workmanship on the rock of Cathair, Cashel, or Castle, “attributed to Conaing Bege-glach, the fifty-sixth monarch of Ireland, . . . . who flourished, accord-ing to the corrected chronology of O'’laherty, nearly 400 B.C.,” the the extraordi- nary stone fortresses on the Western ilands of Arran, etc., one of which Petrie found to be 13 feet thick at the summit and 20 feet high, must undoubtedly have been con-structed by the great Eastern architects, for they are quite beyond the skill and energy of the builders of the little Christian cills. The round tower “attached to the Teampull Finghin of Clonmacnoise” is acknow-ledged to be quite recent, and to have the bond known to engineers as herring-boned ashlar, whilst in England, bell-towers date from the early Norman period. “We have no instance,” says Mr. Keane, “of an Irish bell-tower prior to 1331, when the first one actually known, was built for Christ Church, Dublin.” “On the other hand,” add this author, “Irish topography, legends, history, language and hagiology, all point back to a period when Ireland was ruled by . . . . a people answering to the Cuthites.”2— a Skuthite race that inhabited, he holds, the island up to about 1000 B.C., and who dedicated their structures to gods and saints, whom we can identify with those in Asia. He shows that Kooths were succeeded by Kelts who were no builders, and who held the Koothik structures to be of supernatural origin, and who therefore, like the Christians, did not pull down nor adapt them to a new faith. Early Christians did not, says Marcus Keane, build in stone, nor did English-men here do so till about 1172 A.C. He also establishes that the “most celebrated of the Irish saints of antiquity,3 the reputed founders of these (old) buildings, were the heathen divinities of Canāan and India.” Messrs Keane, Parker, and others, tell us that all the earlier churches of modern Europe were for the most part of wood up to the eleveneth century, when stone became common. Ashlar masonry belongs to the twelfth century. Up to this time it was held “that real grandeur received no diminu-tion from the humility of its habitation,” a fact constantly illustrated in some of the holiest shrines of the East,4 where a little cell marked only by a flag or rather a rag, 1 Keane’s Towers and Temples of Ireland, pp. 287-295.

The miserable little Kibla, or old cell of Meka, is a case in point, and so are the sacred caves and holes of Hebron, Jerusalem, etc., beshrined or built over though these are now, by their ignorant votaries. Contradictions and anomalies, which it is impossible to reconcile, meet us wherever we attempt to trace the old Irish buildings to a Christian source, for not only the architecture, but the strange. sculpturings and relics, are Eastern. At Kil-Melchedor in Kerry is a “Teampull Melch-edor . . . or temple of the golden Molach,” on the inside soffit-stone of the doorway of which, is sculptured in relief the head of a cow or bull, a universal divine symbol. We are told that in Ireland, Melech is associated with the Jovine phalik idea of “The Sun of Dair,” the oak. The old Finian hero, and later saint of the fifth century A.C., was called Dair Maid, and a celebrated female saint was named the Dar-Arca, or Ark of the Oak, just as Parvati is called the Argha or Sakti of Siva. On the doorway of the finest of Ire-land’s old temples—the chapel known as that of “the Cormacs of the Castle” or Cashell, the Teampull do Ronad la Cormac, there were figures of Cean-Tors, as the Irish call their bull-headed symbols; and over the south doorway as a calf, cow or ox which Keating calls “an ancient Irish divinity;”1 and inside the font, or sarco-phagus, was this beautiful reliquary of the old faith, the now celebrated serpent “Crozier of Cashell,” the graphik details of which have been described by us at page 253, volume I., and can only be appreciated by Sivaites. The old Asiatik ideas of the Archangel Michael, and our English St. George, are seen in the Divine Being here standing on the serpent, like Krishna, and piercing the dragon, as Horus did the great serpent Apophis, long centuries before these Hindoo or Chirstian legends arose. But the faith of Cashel is also represented by the anything but “Divine Being” 1 History of Ireland, vol.

We have met with many such figures made of baked clay, near village shrines in India, and therefore agree with Mr. Kennet’s definition of this very coarse “emblem. of female nature.” The Yoni, serpent and fish ideas, are here doubly represented, and such an object is an infallible sign of the ore which once abounded in this mine. The people who made our figure No. 256, were doubtless of the same faith as those who worshipped wells, spirits of mountains, fields and streams, and to whom the Council of Ephesus offered the adoration of the Virgin and her image with. such signal suceess. The designers would undoubtedly, as the Catholic write M. de Beugnot said, have “received this new worship (that of the Virgin) with an enthusiasm sometimes too great. . . . It would become the whole of Christianity. . . . They would not defend their altars against the progress of this worship of the ‘Mother of God.’ They would open to this Mary the temples which they kept shut against Jesus Christ, . . . they would mix with this adoration those heathen ideas, those vain practices, those ridiculous superstitions, from which they were unable to separate themselves;” and this is precisely what happened. The Catholic adds in a note, that he selects this one act of the Church Council of Ephesus, “to show with what facility the worship of Mary (our ‘Female Nature!’) swept before it the remains of heathenism (clearly the Mâ-ya-ism of India, and Venus or Mary worship, is not ‘heathenism’ with this author) which still covered Europe. . . . Notwithstanding the preaching of St. Hilarion, Sicily had remained faithful to the old worship (this ‘heathenism’). After the Council of Ephesus (that with offered Mary to the people who had here previously another ‘Female Nature’) we see its eight finishest Pagan temples become, in a very short space of time, churches under the invoca-tion of the Virgin.”1 All this shows why Christianity so early succeeded in Ireland. The very full account of the faith of Cashel, as given in Towers and Temples, should be read by all who desire further proofs of the Irish developments of ancient religions, espwially in their Ionik, Lunar or feminine form. Here the Moon was the second, if not the first great god-idea. She is called “soft Luan,” Lu, Lugad, Euan and Molua, and is described as a fickle serpentinish water goddess. Many “crosses” are dedicated to her and not to Sol. The remarkable two-handed cross of Moone Abbey, co. Kildare, dedicated by the new faith to St. Moling, and adjoining the church of Ti-Molin, or “the good Luan,” is a highly pagan emblem, and much the same as the open-handed dark Diana of Ephesus, which is exhibited as our fig. 107, page 234, of volume I. Over the oval and open part of the cross which Christians may have cut (though Mr. Keane and others think the cross of Ireland is often a pagan symbol), there is a duck or goose, brooding over an ovate-formed vessel, like that we see conjoined with the early Astarte of the Isle of Naxos in Greece. See our Plate X. 2. Readers will remember that the goose symbol is upon all the standards or sacred poles which surround the temples of Boodhists, and that Egypt likewise acknowledged the goose, as a form of Set,2 “The Creator” and the “Earth Deity,” calling him in 1 M. de Beugnot, de la dist. du Pag. en occident; Towers and Temples, p. 30. 2 [sic., s.b. “Geb” (earlier read “Seb”), the ithyphallic Earth god of the Heliopolitan theogony. — T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Early and late Virgin Idea and Kuklopian Architecture. 423the male form, “the great cackler,”1 and saying that he hatched the “Mundane eggs,” so conspicuous in many old faiths, notably that of Japan. Below the hands in the Moone Abbey Cross, are two serpents (passion), devouring or playing with balls, and below this, a man and woman in indelicate attitude, adoring a male serpent, twisted round an umbrageous tree stem or a phalus, and addressing the man. Below this sits a king, with a budding fleur-de-lis branch or rod, receiving the homage of all creation represented by a bowing man and animal. I can only here allude to a very small portion of the pictorial evidence which Mr Keane gives us, of the pagan sculptures of Ireland. On all aides we see men and animals in strange attitudes, in which the hand, head and open mouth play a principal part, and these are highly phalik euphemism well known in Asiatik faiths. The evidence is not confined to one or two old shrines, as Mr Keane’s excellent drawings show. See especially the bovine and other animal sculpturings on the crosses of Kells in co. Meath, of Monasterboice in co. Louth, of Moone Abbey and Kilcullen in co. Kildare, of Arboe in co. Tyrone, of Glendalough in co. Wicklow, and of evidence tree worship combined, in the Kilclispeen Cross of co. Tipperary, and in the sculptures of Ardmore, in co. Waterford.2 The grand old pagan serpent shalf of Killamery, co. Kilkenny, has already been given by us, through Mr. Keane’s kindness, at page 254 of our volume I., and is there described. Attention has been previously called to the Egyptian form of sloping door jambs, so very common in many old Irish buildings; also to other diatinctly Hamitik and Kuklopian features, as in the irregular but closely fitted joints of the masonry, which accurately resembles the old structures of Malta and Etruria. These features are quite foreign to all that we know of the ancient or mediæval work of Anglo-Saxons or Kelts, but have a very marked resemblance to the following Irish structures of these Cuthite peoples and certain very ancient Mediterranean buildings.

Now the Kelts or Skutho-Kelts who ousted these cultivated old builders, were utterly illiterate, though this does not imply that at the seat of their nation, the same ignorance reigned. “The Book of Ballymote states that Ogmus, the Tuath-de-Danāan, taught these Skyths the knowledge of letters”;3 and if Basks and other Iberii were Kelts, then to Kuths also do these probably owe their learning and arts.

These came and encamped in grass huts beside the great walled and forti-fied cities-—“he towns of stone and of iron” “with pillars halls,” in which these early Turans dwelt; and Indra, the Aryan god, confessed, like the Yahue of Jews, that the Turan chariots of iron were too much for him.1 Bribery and cunning at last, however, enabled the Devatas to overcome the frank and honest Dāsyas; they won over a leader and instructor, generically called a Deva Dāsa, and the Aryan cause prospered. But to resume. Some writers attribute many of the find metal trinkets which have been found in Ireland to the early Keltik period, as in the mythik times of King Tigernach, “the twenty-sixth king of Ireland of 784 B.C.,” or to about the reign of “Mine-Mon, the first pure Irish king of 700 B.C.” The art had no doubt descended from the famous Phenician artificers, and we can understand that though hard out-door labour and the science of architecture were uncongenial to these Kelts, that they yet took readily to the manufacture of jewellery, and hence the many beautifully wrought gold torques, plates, rings, brooches, and such ornaments, which with clothes-pins, skewers, etc., have been abundantly found. The peat bogs have proved, in this and other respects, good preservatives of Ireland’s prehistorik remains. Mr. E. H. Kinahan of the R.I.S., describes the preservation of a great road, Cash, or Path of Oak, of the usual American corderoy character, lying under the flooded sedge bog known as “Duncan’s Flow,” at Balyal-Banargh, Country Antrim.2 The age of the original timber is estimated at five thousand one hundred years, which would ante-date the forest growth to 3200 B.C. The road is considered to have been constructed when Tiglath Pelesar I. was conquering Egypt, and “Ayoodya the Blessed” was the great capital of the Gangetik kingdom. Another well-known sunken road, the Goig, lies twelve feet below the peat in County Limerick, and its estimated as two thousand five hundred years old, while in Lough-na-hinch, County Tipperary, we have another of probably the same period. It is not alone to the Danaans proper, thinks Keane, O’Brien and others, that we owe the best old architectural works of Ireland, but to the three Kuthik peoples, Fomerians, Nemedians,3 and Danaans, who entered the island about the twentieth century B.C., and succeeded to Kelts under Olam Fodla, of say 700 B.C. He was the Irish Solomon, who established the Olympian games or Tal-tine, around the symbolic Laic Feal, or Lingam of the sacred “Green Mound of Tara.” Those Danaans are shown. to be phalik worshippers, who eventually pandered to the vanity of their Keltik conquerors, by ascribing to them a history and lineage which was 1 Wheeler’s Hist. of India, and Judges i. 19.

The Kelts hence said that they had, as a great ancestor, the decidely Kuthite-like demi-god, Kath-ak, or Kat-hak, a double-headed serpent, of whom we still hear a great deal in various country legends. He especially frequented the holy isle of Skatery near the mouth of the Shannon; and Christian Kelts, improving on the tales of their pagan ancestors, declare that he was here met and de-stroyed by their Saint Shanaun. The Leac Feal, or Pala-dium of Tara, which had de-scended to the Kelts through the Danaans, was declared to be a direct gift from the solo fire-god Bel to Olam Fodla’s race of Iberian pagan Kelts, by the hand of Cath-ak, who thus became the Moses of the reace, with a history like that Moabitish Jew, much mixed up with serpents. But Cathak’s honours descended upon Gad-El-glas, when Christianity permeated Ireland; so Moses is said to have received the Leac Feal from Jacob, who used it as his “pillow” at Bethel, and to have given it to Gadelglas after he was converted by looking on the Arabian serpent pole, which with “a serpent of brass,” then became and long remained the national standard of these good Chris-tians.1 There was no desire to shake off the serpent stories. Gad-El-glas like Cathak, was an ophiolater of the Krishnaik, or dark-coloured type,2 or the Mercurial Green of the West; for the name is usually translated, “the Green Snake God.” The learned Boece, who wrote a Latin History of Scotland about 1520, gravely in-forms us, that “Galethus was a Greek, and son of the Athenian Kekrops of the time of the Exodus,” which shows how much he knew about Greeks, and how much we can rely on ancient Latin historians. Perhaps we may make something of the name by admitting what Müller calls “the disease of language,” and that the us or os is an affix, and g and d, facile mutes. In thus way, we find Gadelus or Gathelus = Ad-El, At-El or Ar-El, all well known names for “the High God, Ar,” Ath or Ad, which our Glossary and p. 211 ante makes very clear. The Scotch historian, Fordun, spells the patriarch’s name “Gaythelus,” which reduced as above becomes Auth-El, and some think the foundation for “Gaedil,” the pet name of Erin, and for its language, “Gaelic;” but all this can be better treated in our Glossary. The Keltik worship was more decidedly solar than that of the Danaan phalocists. Their Lingams, like the Mudros of Greko-Phenicians, were called after Sol, Krom or Kroum-leachs, and Kroum is no doubt Graine or Groine, from whence comes the Gaelik Grainan,. Sun. They spoke of Baal or Belus as green in colour, just as others spoke of the primeval Mercury and Keltik Teutates, being “the Green Budh.” He was an ancestral Gad-El-glas, or Baal-tin-glas, or “Fire of the green Baal,” all originally Lingam god-ideas. So Coleman assures us that even Minerva or Wisdom was originally phalik,3 as we know were all “high gods” or “upright gods.” It takes time and education for a people to spiritualise their early phalik deities. A race of Irish 1 Keating’s Hist., i. 208-213; Keane, p. 379. 2 Krishna signifies bluish-black, and Yakob’s Beth-El or “Pillow,” was clearly a lingam. 3 Hindoo Myth., p. 133, cf.

The Fomoraghs seem to have been hated for a time, as we find them called Budhs, and likened to sharks and dog-fish, whilst the Nemedians became with Danaans a “holy” or priestly caste, just as Danaans in after times became the Kuldis or priests of Kelts, and with Christians, “saints” of diverse names, as Saint Danau, etc.1 These Dannans seem strangely mixed up with the classic Danaidæ, and the myth of Ceres and the Ken-taurs. Ceres was the daughter of Danaus, and lived in various caves like the Caph-tor-r-im or bull and phalik worshippers; indeed, Ceres is but the developed Keltik mother Caeser. The word dhanaus is even with Hindoos a Kentaur. In Greek literature we learn that the fifty daughters or Danaidæ or Argos, were Arkites who waited upon the ark of their race, carrying the vessels of holy wayer, and searching out wells, without which the colonists could not exist. These Danai are said to have come from Egypt, and to have been compelled to accept as their first home, the arid Lybian desert from their father Baal or Belus. Now D’-naos, or Danaus, is clearly a name pointing to a faith, the chief symbol of which was the holy boat, naos, or ark, and it was because this chief long ruled over the Arg-ives that these were called Danai. He too had fifty daughters, and his twin brother Egyptus had fifty sons, who went to Argos and demanded the fifty daughters, who, though consenting to marriage, slew all their husbands on the wedding night, save Lynceus or Lugkeus, who remained to rule over all Danai.2 He compelled the women for ever to draw water in Ades with leaking buckets, which seems to mean that they for ever remained barren. Now old Irish records tell tales very similar to these Mediterranean Kutho-Danaitiki legneds. Fintan, the antediluvian Finian and finny hero, who was changed into a fish to survive the deluge (a strange device for an almighty power to resort to), and who is now a canonized saint, came to Ireland “before the deluge, with Keasar, the daughter of Bith,” mother of the Ark or Cell. They “were accompanied by fifty women . . . who set out to make discoveries, and travelled till they came to the fonntain-head of three rivers.” But eventually all died of a certain distemper, and Kaesar of a broken heart;3 that is, the Danaidæ in both cases proved unfruitful. Various other traditions assure us that no Danaides long flourished. In Ireland they rapidly became Fomerians and Nemedians. Even Breas, the first King of Danaans, claimed a Fomorian father and Danaan mother.4 Irish scnlptures abound with Kentaurs or Ken-tors, which are symbolik of the Solar Quickener—the man in head or intelligence, and the bull in fertile force. Greeks said Kentaurs sprang from the male sun-mountain PeIion, Pi-Elion or Pi-Elios, or as Homer styles this, Pheres, the Phar, Phra, or Sun of Egypt, being 1 Towers and Temples, p. 89. 2 There was an important tribe of Lugii in Ger-many, around Silesia and Posan.. 3 Keating’s History, and Keane, p. 155. 4 O’Flaherty’s Ogygia, and Keane, p. 41. "},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"The Danâ-an and Greel Danaidæ. The Kentaur Idea. 427here, too, clearly the root idea. The learned writer in Smith’s Classical Dictionary reminds us that Kentein signifies “to prick or quicken.” Isis or Astarte were thought complete when with a bull’s head,1 as Siva is when carrying chandri, the moon or ark-boat. The divine cow or ark led Kadmus when he went forth to found Grecian Thebes, and cows similarly guided the Jewish ark. It was in an Api-on ark that Isis hid away her Osiris, and in the islet ark of Philo she secreted his genital parts after death, and before such arks and symbols of fertility have all old peoples wor-shipped. They are the early movable temples of races who have not entered on their building era. The Sun, in his greatest energy, was early called “Kir-On, son of Kronos,” or Kr-on, and held to be the great Kentaur who instructed the first Greeks, and bestowed immortality on Prometheus, the “man-maker.” These Kentauri were described as Arkites, sprung from a race of gods and giants such as the Jewish writer of Genesis had evidently heard of. Others said they were the sons of Ixion by the clouds, which Hebrews misunderstanding, called Neph-elim, Rephim, etc.2 Mr. Marcus Keaue thoroughly well establishes the fact that the old Christian saints of Ireland were but the original pagan patriarchs or demi-gods refurbished up, in slightly new forms to suit the Roman calendar. Thus phalik Budh, Baoith, Boodin, or Boedain, the old Kuthite Adam, became “Saint Buithe,” so erroneously identified with the great ascetik of India, another instance of how the physical and spiritual intermingle. Nothing may seem more strange than that he who is now said to enlighten by quicken-ing or vivifying slumbering spirituality and wisdom, should in ruder ages have been symbolized by the Goad, Bode or Thorn-god which stirs up dormant fertile matter; yet it is a fact, though partly due to “the disease of language.” The coarsest as well as the most advancedly spiritual Religions, have given too much cause for the enemy to revile it in this respect.3 Alike to Bud, the Kelto-Kuthite phalik deity, and to the Christian Saint Beo or Buide, no less than to the pious and purely spiritually-minded asetik of Gyâ, did the old and new races erect mounds, towers and strangely phalik objects, so that no wonder European antiqnarians are confused, and ascribe the sacred objects of Skands and Kelts to Budhism, because connected by this word Bud —one which indeed must ever express the universal worship of Fertility. Mr Keanes says that the name of the Irish Saint Mochudee or Mai-hudee also signifies “the good god Budh,” symbolised in the Fidh, and connected with Moloch and Da-beoc, or “God Budh the Darter” or vivifier, and therefore, whether etymologically or not, with Mohudy a corrupt Western pronunciation of Maha- Deva. In both cases the meaning is “The fiery One,” or Moloch. Christians canonized him as Saint Mullogh or Molagga, and his shrines were Tallaghs, Tam-laghts, or “high places,” as the Tamlagh-tar, a Round Tower, claimed for St. Columba on a hill near Londonderry, and which gives name to a parish. 1 Bryant’s Anct.

Da-Beoc was called also the son of “En-Dee,” “the one God,” and O’Brien inisists that his towers or shrines were always shaped in imitation of his organic temple, the phalik creating agent. They were true Muidhrs or Midrs,”sun rays,” and Priapi, such as Diodorus meant when he wrote: “Priapus, se physice consideratur idem est ac Sol; ejusque lux promogenia, unde vis omnis seminatrix.”1 The reader should consult our Index and Glossary further as to this, under Fidh, Pi, Peor, etc. It seems probable that the Simon Breac whom Kelts claim as their king of the ninth century B.C., and who brought their most famous Sun-stone or Muidhr, and who was, like several solar heroes, crucified, was the far older solar Kuthite god, Samen Breach, of the Neimhidh family, whom Keane and O’Flaherty put down, rightly or wrongly, a matter to us here of no moment, in the mythik year 2130 B.C. Both Neim and Samen signify “the Heavens” or “Brightness,” and Breach means “the speckled one,” an idea commonly connected. with solar gods.

It was Fin who conquered the dragon or put down serpent worship, and established all the holy rites connected with Croms or Lingams, and strangely enough, Phins or Feni, as Dr P. W. Joyce3 calls them, showed like Eastern Boodhists, a great liking for tooth charms, which are but small phali, suit-able for carrying or wearing on the person. They are exactly like the little Lingas worn on the arms or secreted on the head or chest of Indian Sivaites. Irish history relates that Christian Feni diligently searched out and revered the teeth of St Patrik. In the Brehon Laws of the Senchus Mor, the Féni or Fiannas, or champions, are described as a real historical people and the law-givers of Irene. What Arthur and his knights were to Brythonik, British, or “Little Briton” Kelts, Fin and his Fénians were in the two Skotias or among the Skoti. Before the pagan Phin was con-verted, he is described as presiding over the Tara assembly “as a Druid in strangely flowered garments (note the likeness to Indra and Herakles), and with a double-pointed head, and bearing in his hand a 1 Keane, p. 321; Diod.

There, says Bryant she was worshipped by the Pi-gal-ia, Pi-al-ia or Pi-als, that is, the worshippers of the Oracle or Pi, who may be called the Pi-i, Phi-ni, Pi-ni, or Pini, a word which is possibly the base of the Latin and French terms for the Phalus, and which is otherwise of unknown but significant derivation. Macrobius calls Der-Ketis “the mother of the gods,” and Syrians, “the receptade of the gods,” that is, an Erk or ark, which the fish repre-sented. If we were fully cognisant of the origin of Der-Ketis, it might turn out to be, like Indian names, a dual or Ling in Yoni. Thus Brahma, sitting on the lotus, is called Brahma-Yoni, and if Der be the Jovine tree of Oak, Der-Ketis would be simply the bi-sexual name of a supreme god. The mythikal Semiramis was a daugh-er of Der-Ketis, who was changed into a dove, and her mother into a fish, showing the close intertwining of all these figures, by phalists. Ireland said her Mermaid or Muirgen was a Danaan divinity, that is, from Asia, and termed her, the Dar-Erka, or “Oak of the Ark,” and this is a name by which she was canonised in the new faith, viz., as “Saint Darerca, St. Liban,” etc. In the Skiol Foenice,1 or Fenian legends of Irelamd, we have heroes and semi-divine persons, who may be classed under the general grandiose term of “the gigantic Fiun-Mac-Cuills,” or “Fini Sons of Cuill,” a Danāan patriarch from whom sprang Ossians, Canāans or Kān-Ans, etc., famous in poetry and music. As this universal Cuill, signifies a “dark,” person, we arc reminded of the Kala-ites of the East, the darkish races of Kale-dunian, and of Turanians generally. Some, however, urge that the feminine form of Cuill is the Ark or Dove, Col or Colm; and the Dove is the Dhune, Yuni, or D’Ione, and Latin Juno. She was the Babylonian Sacca (Sanskrit Sakti), “the Ark or Tabernacle” in which was centred “every quality of gentleness and mercy,” also the “Bearer of the Branch,” Z’emir-amut, “of Peace and Pleanty,” which Aysrian sculptures should they sufficiently represented by merely depicting a tail or wings. She was also “Holy Breath” or Air, and the Virgin, Venus, etc.,2 and Ireland had at one time three hundred houses dedicated to her as Cuile, Col or Colm. Fin was considered “a Divine Emanation of Cuill,” as well as of that goddess-queen so frequently shown as standing with rod in right 1 Phenice = Irish Foenice, but with the hard k, k.

There was clearly some ancient myth and connection of ideas in the minds of the old writers who spoke of “the Zémiramut,” “the Branch of Jessie” and the “Branch of I-uno”—a stick with two reverse bends, and “the budding Branch,” which Bakchus, as “the cup and fruit-bearer,” wields.1 He, like Siva, was an Esh-war of holder of the cross or inciter, for Siva’s name, Kal, signifies “to incite,” and St. Michael is his later representa-tive, and probable namesake in Mahā-chael or M’Kal, so that here again divers gods are welded in to one, and are male or female only according to their contexts, and in this group we must include Fin, Phin or Pheneus, the ancestor of many Phalists. HOLY STONES.—Ireland abounds with “holy stones.” Those upright and hori-zontal ones called elsewhere Dol-mens and Tol or Hole-maens, are in the north of Ireland, often named “Beds of Dermot and Greine,” of which there are said to be three hundred and sixty-six, which looks like the ancient guess at the number of days in the year, each day being a bed or resting-place of Graine. The enclosures, says M’Queen,2 are called Grianan or Grienham, or “Sun-houses.” Thus the Kistvaen at Cloyne is a true Cloich greine, or being large and rock-like, is called a Carig-Croith, another of the many ways of spelling and pronouncing that inscription which the Roman begins on the Inveresk stone with “Apollini Grannio.” Around such objects did the youths and maids of Armorika and all Keltik lands, meet at the solar fêtes. In June, the men decorated with fully-seeded young corn in their hats, and the girls with flowers, especially the homely flax, in their bosoms, came and deposited there on some ancient Dol-maen, and dancing around it, prayed the deity to favour their mammooo prospects. The Council of Nantes in 658, like various church synods in these islands, reaching down to quite modern times, made continual efforts to put a stop to the old rites and worship, but only education, travel aud trade have at last done so. Colonel Forbes Leslie’s valuable volumes abound with descriptions of Irish and British rites, thought to belong only to Asiatik Pagans. He, a far travelled old Scotchman owning large estates in Aberdeenshire, confesses to have acquiesced in altar dedications, not to any unknown God as that of the Areopagus, but to the ever-present and familiar “field-deities of Britain,” so well known to his Keltik retainers, and yet as old as Rome; for to these did a Gaulish Prefect set up an altar on the castle hill of the wall of Antoninus. Sir James Simpson told the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, in 1861, that he had personal knowledge of a cow being burned alive within twenty miles of Edinburgh, as a sacrifice to these spirits, and that “a friend of his, on buying a farm, first of all enclosed a small triangular corner of one field (mark the sacred Yoni-form) as the gude man’s croft (they feared to call him bad), that he might spare the rest of the farm.” Even this cow- 1 See our Plate V. 5 and 9, p. 104, vol. i.

It was not within the power of Governments or EccIesiastical Councils to put down so universal a faith, though from the fifth to the seventeenth centuries they ever and again tried, by sending forth penal decrees. The religion was one enlisting every human emotion, and entering into the constant family and social life of all ages and classes. The people themselves were at once the ministers and recipients of the rites, which they not only thoroughly understood, but fancied they saw immediate benefit from, whilst the new faith spoke to them only of a long future and dread uncertainty. Throughout Europe also, Christianity was local and centralized, whilst the old faith was centred in not only every town and hamlet, but every family and heart. It extended with equal warmth and as a mighty whole—grand in its diffusiveness, from every small capital to even civilized and imperial Rome; from the far North-Western “Isle of Saints” off the Sligo coast, where till quite lately stood the Mui(dh)r or Cloich graine of an infatuated peasantry, to the far south-east Mudros of a Roman emperor at Emisa, of which it was written,1 Apud Emissensos solis simulacrum erat grande Saxum conicum nigrum, quod jactabant a cælo fuisse delapsum. Both were Palla-diums, though of very different peoples—heaven-born Phali, like those of Troy, Arkadia, Italy, and the Americas; even Yorkshire fold say their Rud-stone fell from heaven.2 Such a faith is all but immortal, and hence still dominates the world; it is enshrined in the natural heart, and appeals to every natural instinct of untutored man, and there-fore comes home to and is at once accepted by every race however otherwise diverse; it is daily fed also by the ever-recurring phases of all the phenomenal world. It was the glory of the ancient Kelts and Skands, of the people of Emisa as well as of the Jews, that their sacred stones were not fashioned by men’s hands. Herodian, too, tells us this, and his description of the Emisa. stone—an ovatish Lingam—reminds us of many in Eastern lands. The reader will find the latter portrayed as it rested in its shrine at fig. 8 of plate X., where too, is seen the Pillar-stone, the “Bel-Pe-Or,” which stands on the hill of Tara; but this is not the square-cut lingam of the Tara Cemetery, with its well-known figure of the Irish Sheela-na.-gig in relievo. Mr. Keane calls this last the Clu-ain, or “stone of Ana,”3 of which we have many, as the Klu-an-more, Kl-on An, the Ana-mora, or “great earth mother”—a mater deorum in King’s County, not far from the Golden Molach or Saint Molna’s stone. Near to this magna mater, and in honour of her and St. Molna, the youths of both sexes used to assemble—perhaps they do so still—for song and dance, and to arrange their love affairs, when Ceres or Lakshmi pours forth their harvest blessings; for in Ire-land, as in India, August has a fête or gule, which no solo-phalik worshipper neglects. Some of Ana’s stones have such names as “The Great Meadow,” or “Stone of the Great 1 Keane, p. 334; and Vallencey’s Collect., iv. 212. 2 We were told this on lately visiting it.

The meadow is the Beth or “abode of Anu,” and the Klu-ain is there-fore the Kloich-grain, and probably so etymologically, for g is a facile sound in old drawling tongues. The Sheela-nagig is called by the Irish Awn-nagh or Awn- agh, and its symbol was the serpent or nagh; yet Agh, which is a field, may convey here too, the Isisian meadow-idea. Ilands were favourite abodes of the Irish Arkite Ana, and were much connected with serpents, as the Ile or Inis-cathi-ana, the southern promontory of which was called Rin-ana. Attention has been already called to An, Ain or Aine, being in several tongues, names for the moon, founts and wells, as in Bel-ain. Bli-ain signified “the completed circle of the sun,” that is, “the year.” Our readers should carefully compare the various forms of sacred stones, whether in or out of arks, and with or without bosses or bosoms, see Plates VI., IX., and X. In Plate VI. we see both forms, and in cups upon coins. They must have been much revered objects, when the coinage of the realm is thus made to show both the ark and “its two stones” of testimony, and we may be certain many oaths have been sworn there, and much adoration offered. But endless are the types of that worship which placed such sacred emblems in holes, and caves, and then temples, as did Shemites, Mekan or Judean, Aryan and Turanian. See further at pages 165-167 of our first volume. The Sardinian stone, fig. 6, Plate X., differs only from Dr. Hydes Phenician Mudros in representing this androgynous deity as being more oval in section, and with mammæ like the Tartar emblems, Plate IX., type 4. Fig. 5, Plate IX. from Bretony, is exactly like the Murdros, and fig. 3, a sculptured variant of the same, such as we may believe the tumulus of Tamis, Plate VIII., fig. 7, was raised in imitation of. The Maltese seem to prefer the Apian or pointed Egyptian form of lingam, as in figs. 3 and 5 of Plate VI., and like the Egyptian worshippers of that strange involuntary or spontaneous procreator, they rarely shrink from unblushing symbolism. A Linga stone is here shown standing before a Yoni one, as the Linga stood before the Pythian orifice at Delphi, and as we see Serpents and a dog do in Plate XIII. 1 and 3. It is perhaps necessary, in explanation of the words “involuntary procreator,” to state that most probably the Bull was chosen as the special symbol of the Creator, “because in that animal alone, procreation is the result of an instantaneous act, instinctive and with-out effort,”1 and therefore one thought to be inspired by the Creator. The Maltese Yoni altar, Plate VI. 6, is precisely the Asyrian “Tree of Life,” given in our fig. 25. p. 73, and the Jewish “Grove,” p. 72 of vol. I. Captain Oliver writes regarding the Torre Dei Giganti of that iland, that “there were in the niches for idols, small pyramidal cones of stone, not dissimilar to those represented in the hands of Egyp-tian priests kneeling before the sacred serpents;” (see our fig. 65, p. 184); also “drilled 1 Egypt and the Pentateuch, p. 91.

This sacred stone or hole probably led to the founding of this fine English shrine. Captian Oliver found in the Sepolture Deis Gigantes, near the Nuraghi of Sardinia, “curiously recessed slabs, . . . . lines of six conical stone pillars . . . . with elliptical bases and sharpened summits, the three to the south having prominent projections, evidently intended for mammæ.” The cones were “like those found in the Maltese remains, or the pyramidal honey-cakes marked with the saared Omphalos . . . . or had spiral bosses in connection with the Ophiolatreia of the ancients.” All this would have been made much more clear to us if the writer had known of the Sivaism and Vishnuism of India. The study of the following figures will perhaps help the reader. Our Plate VII., fig. 8; Plate IX., 1; Plate X., 11 and 12; and Plate XII., 7. HOLED-STONES AND BALLS.—Holed stones, as in Plate XI., are thought by many, and not without good reaaont to be connected with Ball-playing, a religious game or even rite once common in several countries and in some way connected with the sun, of which the ball was a recognised emblem. Bishops and Priests used at certain solar fêtes to assemble for “balling” in the oratories of cathedrals; and in “the diversions of Montezuma by Herrera,” we are told that ball courts were attached to the temples and superintended by high officers called “Lords,” who never played without making offerings to the solar Kurios, and performing certain religious ceremonies. The holed or Yoni stones of Kelts—specially common in Yucatan, Armorika, Malta, and India—may have been connected with ball-playing, but per-sonalIy we have only known of them as trysting or swearing places; the hand being thrust into the charmed orifice, as it was laid upon the “thigh” or testes of the male, when making a solemn affirmation. Josephus says, it was even the custom in his day to swear solemn oaths, as related of Abraham and Isaac. We have already dwelt upon hollows in rocks, as Beth-lechems or natural mills, where the bread of the family is prepared, and these as well as their reverse—a convex, pap-like or protrud-ing form of rock of mount—were breasts of great Ana. Bryant says, these were called Tit-aia, analogous to Tit-thos Aias, also styled Lophos Mastoeides. The altars were styled Tit-an and Titanis, from that great “Light” or godly fount of An or Anis.2 All this applies as much to the Shemitik shrines—the rocky cave, hollows, and ovate protuberances so revered both in ancient and modern times throughout Syria and Judea, as to those in the sacred places of Aryans, be they lrana, Skyths or Kelts. 1 Jour.

HANDS AND FINGERS.—The “Red hand of Ireland,”1 is known alike to Turaians, Shemites, and Aryans, and from the Americas to furthest Asia. We have btfore made clear that the hand, being an organ peculiar to man, is in the East a sign of Siva, and seems to have been identified with hie emblem even by the Medes, see our fig. 222, page 139. All men have usually worshipped, and plighted their troth, or sworn by manual signs, so the hand naturally stands as the sign of man himself; but more than this, Easterns attach a significance to it as an organ wihout which the procreat- ing one is useless. In Germany, says J. Grimm, the hand was Tyr, the son of Odin “the one-handed,” for he lost one limb by the biting wintry wolf; that is, he became powerless to produce. Horace speaks of the rubente dexterâ manu, and red was fertility in woman and fierceness in Sol. He was then the “Golden handed” Fer-tilizer, whom ancient Irans denoted by their name Zer-dosht, and Irish Kelts placed as a talisman on their Ulster shield. These last related all the legends we have recounted as to the great Danaan king who lost his hand in battle, and had therefore to lay aside his crown for seven years, until a Vulcan gave him a metal one. The Irish solo-phalik idea is seen in the “crosses” of Clou-Mac-Noise and Monasterboise, where, as in fig. 288, all the fingers are carefully placed in the centre of the circle of fertility; there the Asiatik place the seeds of the deity, compare fig. 188, page 509, and also that on page 487 of Vol. I. The Vedas constantly spcak of Savatār as “the Golden-handed Sun,” who lost this limb owing to his efforts when at sacrifices,2 and who remained im-potent until the deity restored to him a hand of gold—the organ by which is effected “the great sacrifice of nature,” procreation, and after which comes temporary impotence. Hindus, like the high Asian tribes and the old Mexicans, usually impress a hand covered with blood or vermilion on the doorposts of their temples, that is, on the Delpheus or “Door of Life;” and the great Islamite, Mahmood, when he captured Constantinople, rode up to the holy feminine shrine of St Sophia, and reaching up as high as he could, there unwit-tingly imprinted this bloody sign of Great Siva. Leslie argues that the Kabiri intro-duced hands, as a reasonable emblem of worship,3 because these are man’s providers and defenders, but this, though a natural enough explanation as regards the great metal workers and builders—the fathers of the ten Daktyloi or Fingers, through Vulcan the gody artificer, yet lacks the religious, and therefore common and true lines which religious derivatives must take; only so, however, because not pur- sued deep enough. Thus the finger is a common phalik sign, and strangers examin-ing to-day the rural shrines of some of our Indian tribes, would be very apt to say they 1 Keane, p. 136.

We must remember how often the hand appears with other significant objects on the Arms of men and Nations, and notably so on Roman standards, and try to follow up the ideas which Mont-fauçon, whether he wills or no, makes pretty clear in his Plate XLIV. iv. i., where a whole Latin army is seen in solemn prayer, before what the Sivaite would also bow down to. The head of a standard had often a hand inside a wreath of flowers, or a spear—the Quiris god—passing through a dark oval aperture, and two suns below having testes-like drops on each side.1 The solar orb, with side drops or two wings, is identical, for the wings are a euphemism for phali, and are so shown in the sculptures of Nismes, Roman though they may be. In the old shrines of America, Leslie says, the “Sacred Hand was a favourite object of art,” and Stevens in his Yucatan says, “the red hand stared us in the face over all the ruined buildings of the country . . . . . not drawn or painted, but stamped by the living hand, the pressure of the palm upon the stone”2 being quite distinct, the thumb and fingers being extended as we see in Irish and Hindoo hands. That Jews also knew the veiled meaning of the hand as well as the feet, we see by their using the hand as well as the phalus in swearing. Their Jehovah also says to their “second Moses,” as they style Ezra, “The Hand of man is be-twixt the Heel and the Hand, . . . . for Esau (the hirsute lascivious one) is the end of the World, and Jacob (or “the swelling female”) is the beginning of it that followeth.”3 The TARA STONE.—We must, at the risk of some repetition, here look specially into the Irish history of the Tara Soone. Pennant says, “the Skone coronation chair had for its base the Fatal Stone or Palladium of Scotland,” and he and many others, includ-ing Irish antiquaries, seem to have accepted the tradition that the Tara Stone was lent or forcibly taken from Tara, a.bout the fifth century A.C., for the coronation of Fergus MacEre, and that it was retained by the Dalriad Skoti in Argyleshire until 842, when Keneth II., son of Alpine, succeeded to the Pictish or Kale-dunian king-dom. He is said to have removed it to Skone, because of the peculiar belief that it was “the stone of good fortune,” and that without it neither the thrown nor succes-sion could be established and retained. In accordance with this theory, the old Irish names of the Tara Stone, the Leac Fail and Cloch na Cincourhna, were duly trans- 1 Cf. our Figs. 188, p. 509, Vol. i.; Fig. 202, p. 64, &c. 2 Vol. i., p. 177. 3 Cf.

Thus it is still a Jupiter Fœderis, or “Stone of Covenants,” or for swearing on, as all lingams are, and ever have been. The Scots, following up their belief that “Where’er this monument is found, The Scottish race shall reign,”1 hailed the accomplishment of this prophecy at the accession of James VI. to the Crown of England. Some Irish writers affirm that this Palla-dium had then been two thousand years in their country; and it is very probable that the Tara stone, around which the Tal-tine or Bel-tine fetes were celebrated, had existed before that period. The learned Keltik historian, Dr. Skene, tells us that the Irish Book of Conquests of 1100 A.C., states that the first “monarchy” which established Teamer or Tara, was that of the Firbolgs, after whom came the famous builders the Danaans, then the Milesians or present Irish.2 Now the Danaans, we have shown, were evidently driven there by that great wave which was disturbing the whole Aithoipian or Turanian world between the twentieth and seventeenth centuries B.C.; but monarchies take usually a long time to form, so that we may believe that Tara, which was the capital of five principalities, must have been an old and sacred site, at least some hundreds of years before the Danaan invasion. Some Irish writers call the stone “The Lia Fo-ail,” and say that this signifies the Lia on which kings sat, but stone or phalik worshippers do not adopt shapeless bits of stone like the Skone fragment, though they religiously cling to pieces of once venerated Yonis and Lingams however small and formless these become. This is the case with many highly venerated Grecian, Syrian and Arabian ones, and notably so with the two relics of the Mekan Ark, viz., the flat “Black stone”—the great attraction of the inner cell, of which No. II. in this Fig. is a plan and section, and with another fairly formed Lingam, which is build into an angle of the outer wall of the Kibla, where “the Faithful” kiss it during their circumambulatory prayers.

Both it and the outer fragments were parts of regular Lingams, either single, like the Alāt or Alla, No. I, on the plain pedestal, or the dual El or Al, which we denote by the Syrian plural term Al-e-im or Elohim, trans-lated “God” or “Gods” in the old Testament, but originally meaning the El-Ram-Gods —a dual-uno or completed deity, like Siva, the Argha Nât, or the “El in the Argha.” The well and trees are constant acoompaniments, and below is given the Grecianized. Linga (III) or Hermaik idea of say three or four centuries B.C., together with the rude Karn, Bethel or Galeed of Jacob and all primeval peoples, and which still pervades all lands, Christian and “Heathen.” At Tara, now or up to a short time ago, was exactly such a stone as is here seen topping the Karn. Mr R. Robert Brash describes it in his Ancient Monuments as a “cylindrical obelisk standing in the Rath-na-Riogh . . . six feet above, and as much below the ground,” and like that given in our fig. 9, Plate X. p. 168. of vol. i. As it is also exactly in the spot indicated by the native writers of the tenth to the twelfth centuries, we have here no doubt, the original Tara Lingam, for, unlike the soft sand-stone one of Skone, this Tara stone would be as enduring as those of Karnak and Stonehenge. Some legends say it came from the bottom of the sea, as did that old one, the churning Lingam of the god Vishnu in the Kurma or Tortoise Avatâr, fully treated of elsewhere; others say a colony of Kelts, led by the too-Christianly-named chief Simon Breac, brought it from Spain. This leader was of course a Solo-fire worshipper, and therefore probaby called Shem-On-Pur-Ak—words merely emphasiz-ing the Kaldian, Phenician, Egpytian, Iranian and Arabic worship of sun and fire, see our Glossary. lreland was perhaps “Inis Fe-al,” or Pi-Al, from the wide celebrity of its divine Oracle or Pi. Olan Fodla, “the Keltik Solomon,” acting like the Judean one, resuscitated, we are told, the solo-fire worship of his people about 100 B.C., when he forcibly seized the Leac Feal from the Danaans, who when driven away from Tara, carried it off with them to Connaught or Ald-an-mact. We have already mentioned various traditions as to the origin and travels of this venerated Pala-Dium, as that from Egypt and Jacob, it somehow descended to Moses, then to Cathak, and finally to Gathelglas, and that everywhere it was persistently mixed up with legends concerning serpents, poles or pillars. We are no more called upon to believe all these strange Kelto-Mosaik legends than the Egypto-Turanian ones of Genesis and later, with which Jews mix up their race prior to say one thousand years or so B.C., but if we would unravel ancient history, we must watchfully note the names and ideas of the myths, and especially the appearance and disappearance of all "},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 438emblems living, dead or phenomenal, as of serpents, holy stones, hills, solar signs and names, for they are Faith-ideas and denote lines of thought. The name Fiall or Feale (fem.) occurs as a river in Kerry, and we are told Feale was a lovely woman who died from fright, killed by her lord, Feal, whom not knowing, she observed when he was naked.1 Now the Tara stone, we may be certain, was called after the deity it symbolized, or the land or city in which it was primarily revered, which again would assuredly be called after it, if the greatest divinity of the place; and Dr. Skene, an author not disposed probably to our views, tells us that the Danaáns came from four cities, Falias, Gorias, Finias, and Murias, which would of course, mean tribes or faiths, or both. From the last three cities these Danaáns brought “a sword,” “a spear” (the Quiris god of ancient Rome), and a “cauldron”—the sacred Grail or Eucharistic cup. Falias had of course, his own special represen-tative in the Leac Fal on Mount Teamar, and from this F’al would readily spring the nineteen Saints Fillan or Fallan, whom Bishop Forbes told us the Irish hagiological writers enumerated, as well as the numerous Scotish and Irish names of Fil, Fal, Faelan, Filan, etc. It is of no moment as regards our researches into the origin of faiths, nor do we see, were it otherwise, any sufficient. reason for holding that the Tam Leac Feal was either the Argyleshire or Perthahire Lingam, and though differing from Saint Columba and many ancient writers, we are here glad to find our-selves in unison with such learned and orthodox authors as Drs. Petrie, Skene, Stuart, etc., nor without good and sufficient reasons. Thus the Tara stone was “a sounding one,” like to the sounding and rocking stones of Egypt and Asia, and if, from a primary rock (as is probable from what we know of other Irish stones and Keane’s drawing given as fig, 9 of our Plate X., p. 168), it possibly gave a ringing sound when peculiarly struck. This the Skone stone never could have done, for it is a small block of red sandstone, of the same character, says Dr Skene, as that found in the neighbour-hood, and measuring 26 × 16¾ × 10½ inches.2 We quite believe that in its prehistoric era, it too had been a Lingam or Yoni emblem, and that Columba and his Skoti, and other Argyleshire men, had others, and that the “holy stones” still met with through-out these iles were similar, and that ail these are only the remains of a great and innumerable company; this may be all freely granted and is indeed, a conclusion which every person who knows anything of the stone worship of Syria, Arabia and India, must arrive at. The Skone stone has a history of ita own, and a very interesting one, which, though only going back about nine hundred years, can be readily imagined in its prehistoric times, when the Kale-dun Solo-phalists ruled Alba. At the coronation upon it of Alexander III., in July 1249, its resting-place was “in the Cimiterium of Skone Abbey,” under the sacred oval-shaped hillock called the Moot Hill—the Mons Placiti of the Regiam Majestatem, and the Collis Credulitatis or “Mount of Belief” 1 Joyce’s Irish Names, p. 159.  2 Cf. ante, and Procs.

The Moot Hill Worship. 439of The Chronicles.1 Many Kelts called it the Kaislen Kredi, and ecclesiastics named it the “Mount of Belief,” so far back says Dr Skene as 906, and described it as situated in the Friar’s Den, a raving running close by the old as well as new palace of Skone, which is about a mile from Perth. The Mount, which had a top area of 100 × 60 yards, overlooked the ancient cemetery, thus presiding as an hypethral temple over the dead, precisely as do our present churches. Between 1600 and 1624, all stoness, and fragments of stones, belong-ing to the old abbey and cemetery, were made use of for the new palace and a church, which was then erected on the old “Mount of the Faith.” Strange, yet not sudden vicissitude! for ten centuries had elapsed since the spiritual had here striven against the concrete God-idea; and still in this nineteenth century does the old God peep out in such phrascologr as “the Stone of the Corner,” “the Pillar of Truth,” and similar venerated language of many Bibles.2 The Skone stone was exactly such as Jacob, Absalom, Solomon and other Syrians set up, and before which all good men “adored,” that is “worshipped” or “ratified vows.” In later times it lay between the mount and a cell or chapel, and this is as we might expect after it ceased to be “the Pillar of Toth” or Truth, whilst it still remained the venerated relic of a nation’s worship. Its proper place was then amidst the dead, where also was found the Bell and Yoni stone of St. Filian’s, when that faith died. The Christian placed the Skone stone near their holiest spot, “the great altar in the Skone Monastery,” but before that it is said to have been carried to Dunstaffnage for safety.3 The Moot Hill of Skone satisfies every topographical want of the Sivaite, being not only in a sequestered dell, but one traversed by a rivulet, which near the holy mount opens out and discharges its waters into the Tay. This too must have been a sacred stream, or one much revered by the old races, for, from its high mountain source to its debouchure, its path is dotted with objects fraught with pious memories. It draws its waters also from the back bone of the Iand—the sternest and loftiest mountains of the Skoti, as well as from some of the sweetest and most fertile straths of the Kale-duns, and though small and turbulent by St. Faelans’s charmed pool, yet, fed by several large affluents, it sweeps, a calm and majestic stream, through many richly pastured meads, long before it passes the Keltik capital, after which it opens out into one of the grandest estuaries in these islands. The “Moot Hill” remained the coronation spot down to quite modern times. Robert III. “sat upon it” in 1390, issuing his decrees, as from “the seat of an Oracle,”4 for it was named the ancient sedes principales—the seat which “symbolized the 1 Procs. Soc. of Ants.

A word now as to the Ile of Man ere we close. ILE OF MAN, MAUN, or MON, or MANX LAND.—The Druid or Pagan remains of this small iland (some 24 × 11 miles) have been almost effaced by time and Christian fanaticism, of a very devout but ignorant and superstitious type. There are still the remains of many stone circles, but in a very dilapidated condition, and without, so far as we could ascertain, many of the characteristic Lingam-like stones described else-where.2 It is evident, however, that every village once had its little stone circle or holy mound, well, and tree. One of the old shrines we examined, called the Cloven Stones (becauae the two largest are split), is very characteristically situated at the high apex of a deep gorge, east of the village of Baldrine, half-way between Douglas and Laxley, where the high lands begin to break and fall away abruptly eastward to the sea, and widening out, display a bright expanse of ocean precisely where the solo-phalists could see their God of Fertility daily rise, in his mid-snmmer strength, when their Bel-tein fires were lighted in his honour all over the land. This is topographically exactly such a spot as they would choose on which to sacrifice the lamb without blemish, and here their chanticleer would each morn welcome their rising deity. Here too would earnest prayers be daily put up for increase to flocks and herds, and blessings on the family and tribe, just as is still done in the adjoining rude Cill, or very “Primitive Methodist Chapel.” Both the ancient and present Kelts, firmly maintained that their god required blood for blood as well as their urgent prayers, to remind him of them and their wants; and these, both peoples offered, believing that be would alter the laws of nature on their behalf. This continuation of faiths is seldom however recognized, and here the devout Methodist population now look down with all the contempt and arrogance usually begotten by ignorance, upon the shrine of their ancestors. A little furlher north, overlooking the pretty vale in which lies the thriving mining town of Laxley, there is another circle, which owing, to the popular canonization of one known now as “King Orry,” “Great Orr,” or “Saint Orr,” has been better 1 Ibid., p. 81. 2 See especially, Stonehenge, vol. ii. p. 232, 233, and elswhere."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Circles, Lingams and Rites of Manx Men. 441Fig.291.—SACRED STONE AND CELL OF “KING ORRY,” ILE OF MAN. preserved. Here stands an undoubted and remarkable Lingam stone, situated on an eminence and over a very suggestive cavity, formerly it is said, a regular Kill or Cell, in which was an ark or rude Kistvaen, vide this fig. 291 copied accurately by our engraver from photos we bought on the spot. The guide-books truly state that, “this is the most remarkable monument of antiquity on the island, which, both from its strange appearance and traditions, draws thousands of tourists annually.” Of course around it are grouped quite a cemetery of ancient graves, and Christians have on this account—forgetful how they too have ever sought to be buried around their God’s dwelling, fancied that this Lingam and its ark, merely marked one particularly sacred grave of a mythical king and his family. And this is indeed true, according to the Euhemerian doctrine, that “all the gods were men;” for the more we have studied Manx lore, the more does it appear that the so-called Or or Orry, was merely the Zeus or Herakles of the early settlers. All towers, columns or mounds, were his, or sacred to Or; and he was the Moses who gave the first laws and established the Tyn-wald Mounts—Sinais, Tāras or Skones—around which at stated solar fêtes or phazes, the tribes assembled to hear the laws of their oracle; for still do all Manx-men congregate at early mid-summer before the Tyn-wald Mount of St Ion or John—suitable name—to read and authorize the legislation of the year. This is still a solemn political, social and even religious rite, without which no laws are legal, though passed by England’s Queen and Parliament. Here also, King Or required his nomads to present annually to him a bundle of grass, once their only crop, and the universal early offering of nomadik tribes as our Glossary and Indexes will show. The sacred Kusa grass of Asia, still enters into nearly every social and religious rite of the non Aryans as well as Hindu Aryans of India, and not on this Ion-ian Tyn-wald only, was this Manx Tor to be so worshipped. Every hill was his, and his children, say Manx legends, were commanded to offer grass to him at certain solar phazes on all the high mountains of their land, as well as to strew this around his fane by Ion’s Church—his Dove or Ark—as well as along that strangely hidden Via Sacra which leads to his phalik-crowned Zion. Along this it is that an English bishop, governor, and all the high officials, move in solemn state and to measured cadence, every midsummer month. No stone or obelisk now indeed crowns the sacred mount, but at this time there is erected an equally suggestive pyramidal tent, the pole of which carries the "},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all Lands. 442red Cross banner of St. George. In this fig. 292, we give a sketch copied accurately by our engraver from Brown’s Popular Guide, which taken in connection with our own Fig 292.—PLAN AND SKETCH OF THE SACRED TYNWALD HILL OF ST. JOH’S OR ION’S, ILE OF MAN. plan, shows the covered way Via Sacra, or vagina, curiously hid from public gaze by two artificial embankments. The natural topography is also Sivakaly correct, for this mount and ark are considered by Manxmen to be situated in the centre of their iland or little world, and it is therefore like Delphi the Om-phallos, in the Yoni;1 and, geologically we should say. this was once true before the northern low-lying portion of the iland north of Ramsay and Ballaugh rose from the sea. But this Tyn-wald Mount has another characteristic, reminding us of the Mons Palantine—tyn or tien—where great Jupiter Stator stood, overlooking the re-entering angle of the Tiber; for this T’Or’s Mount also so stands with reference to the winding stream which here washes the low southern base of the great range of mountains on which is located this so-called umbilicus, equally dividing the land north and south. Tradition, alike Christian and Pagan, informs us, say the Guide-books, that the modern Church or Ark, and its covered way connecting it with the phalikly crowned mound, stands upon “the site of one built in 1699, which tradition asserts had been pre-ceded by a temple dedicated to Thor.”2 And what more fitting name could be chosen for the shrine of this Apolo or “Fiery One,” than Tein or Tyn? His is the Ting-valla of Iceland, as well as the Ding-wall and Tin-wald hills of Scotland, and though Christian Manxmen now call their shrine Kronky-Keillown, or “John’s Church Hill,” we do not require to go to any such secondary derivative. Popularly, Tyn-wald is held to mean a Forum Judicialis and “Hill of Assembly,” and this the Thing or Ting, or Thor’s Court of Sacred Fire, ever was.

Or, Hor or Orry, is in many respects a sug-gestive name, as our Glossary will show under these, and Ar, Al, As, Alt, &c. With Kelts, r’s, l’s, the s, h, c, and z, are very loose sounds, both as to change and omission, and so also Ol, Aul, Al, and Att or Ath, the usual name of the old Keltik stone or Altar-god—the T’Or, Th’Or, Tot or Tor. We must also remember that Urcia or Orsia, was the old Keltik Bask for Jupiter Tonans, or the Thunder God, and that Or or Ur, is believed by specialists to have come from Asia with Iranians, and to belong possibly to the Zend langage.1 This root, Or, Ur, or Aur, is the Light god, and the Ci or Sia, a prefix like the Indian Jee or Dee, as in Mahā-Jee, Siva-Jee, &c., or else “land” or “country” as in As-ia, “the land of As-ites,” Ar-ites or Orites. It is still from “Orry’s Tower” at Kirk-Michael, or St Michael’s, the phalik Mah or Mih-Kal, that all ecclesiastical and much political power emanates, for here resides the Bishop of Sodor and Man, once a real ruler, but now only the second most important functionary of the iland; for secularizing England and the Method-istical Manxmen, now principally look to the English Governor and the “House of Keys,” over which he, and not now the bishop, presides.2 “Orry’s Tower” is a most interesting name-relic, for the present “Tower” is of comparatively modern date though Christians have claimed it since 1230 as the residence of the head of the iland church. In fact the Christian high priest took the place of the Arch-Druid, for here too was “an original Tyn-wald” on the hill of Reneurling, appropriately called “the hill of the Eagle,” or of Jove, and from hence issued all laws, as from the Golden or Solar Eagle of our churches still issues “The Law of the Lord.” In the neighbourhood of the present and fonner Tyn-walds, are circles, Kistvaens and Runik stones, most probably the phali of Kelts first, then of Danes and so-called Christians, but as time went on these became Christianized and adorned with crosses, &c. Near to Douglas and Marown, is a Kist-vaen or Dolmen, now claimed by Christians as the “Chair of St Patrik,” and held sacred to the memory of three Saint, no doubt 1 London: Acad., 4 Sept. 1800, p. 193.

There, and on. p. 166, we see many similar emblems common to Kelts, Hindoos, and all solo-phalists, and a three-legged man needs no interpretation to them. Man’s third and central limb is his “weapon,” and this the ilanders delight to depict him in the valiant exercise of, though they little understand the true origin or signification of this favourite seal. It did, however, call forth great mirth and some indelicate joking, when we asked why in the numerous grotesque pictures, the three-legged one never appears as a female, but always as a courageous male with his third leg erect, and usually kicking or exciting others to merriment. When the figure appears as only three lines radiating from a centre with upturned ends—the feet, we see that it is simply the solo-phalik Swastika of Asia and America, and like to this Budhist one if we run the lines closer.1 Here the male and female organs are in conjunction, with Fire, Sun, and Moon, and the feet or phali, are segments of cones resting on Yonis between which spring forth volutes or scrolls, such as conventionally represent Fire just as feet do so, regarding which full details appear in our Glossary and elsewhere. Much has been written regarding the Asiatik cross or Fylfot, but here we will state our own views, aDd 8uch as we formed very many years ago, when the symbol used to come daily before us in our peregrinations throughout India. The Sanskrit word Svasti, or words Su-asti, signify “well it is,” or “so bet it,” i.e. Amen, or “our blessing or approbation go with you,” or “may it be well with us;” but any cruciform object may be termed a svasti, as cross roads, a cruciformed temple, the crossed arms, or a man standing with stridled legs and arms; indeed this is called both a wan (Svasti) and a zan or “man” in China, and is a symbol of the oldest creating god-idea, the Shang or Shang-Tê, the pillared or ithyphalic Shang—our F without a top. Both with Hindus and Chinese the svasti or wan denotes “health and happiness,” and can scare away evil; and it is therefore commonly branded or marked on cattle, especially the village bull, from whence, perhaps, it has the meaning of “a libertine” or general 1 For Asia cf. R. As. Soc. Jour. xviii. 391; and for America, xi., iii., LIV., and Inman’s Ancient Faiths, i. 151.

The geographical limits of the emblem or its variants seem unbounded. In both the Americas it is well represented, especially amid the ancient ruim of Palenque in Yukatan and in Mexico and Peru, where it is commonest in what we call the “Greek pattern.” Professor Holmboe describes it as a divine emblem in the old faith of the phalik Wod, Budh or Bod of Skandinavia,1 and it is acknowledged by archeologists to be represented in these three and four armed hammers and crosses of Tor. These radiate suggestively from a central sun (yoni?), which is seen still more clearly developed in the Syracusian coins of the 3d and 4th centuries B.C., which Mr. E. Thomas gives us in Plate III., attached to his valuble article in the Lon. Numis. Chron., I. of 1880. If in any place, we should expect to find the Svasti in Sicily, the early home of the Sikuli and other Pelasgik Kelts, and the ile specially dedicated to their Ab-Elio or Apolo. These Sikuli, like the Manx Kelts, perferred the three-legged and spurred or feathered forms; for out of eleven coins in Mr. Thomas’ plates, seven are three-rayed, Svastis, springing from unmistakeable yonis, whilst one has, instead of spurred “feet,” three cocks’ heads, stamping them at once as Solo-phalik emblems; whilst on the observe is the Lukean Boar of Jove, but also of Vishnu as the personified impregnator. Mr. Thomas gives us another plate to establish what his article is written to prove, viz., the golar signification of the Svasti as developed from raised circles, crosses, &c., which none who have studied Solo-phalik lore can for a moment doubt. These volumes, and Inman’s, Higgins’, Bryant’s, &c., have usually taken such for granted, whilst our own observation in India and con-verse with Hindus, has assured us that wherever the rays are elaborated, the phalus—as Surya’s emblem or mode of carrying out all animal fertilization—is usually meant. Mr. Thomas’ Plate II. goes further, confirming what we have always maintained, viz., the original Solo-phalik nature of all crosses, triquetra and otherwise rayed and revolving-looking figures. The rays are Apolo’s arrows or obeliekal symbols, similar to the pointed or phalik-handed rays of Ra, Aten or Adon-Ra, given in our figs, 78, 79, pages 199 and 200, Vol. I., where some of these symbols of life are seen dropping from the fertilizer’s hands upon the Isian ark of his servants. In India we commonly see Svastis sketched in white or red colours over the door-ways or on the door-step or jambs of city houses, parts sacred to the deities of the “Door of Life;” and in country cottages as soon as the morning cleansing with earth, and the sacred cow dung is smeared over all, the mistress of the house prominently sketches the sacred emblem in front of her house, garden gate, &c. Usually it is the four-legged white one in Bengal and the north-west. but many Madrases and the Mahâjans or bankers, and various Punjab sects prefer the three-rayed symbol of Manxmen. Almost all Hindus use or should use crude cinnabar or vermilion, and three-legged swastis during 1 Traces de Budh.

In China, says a writer on its folk lore, “the mystic Svastika or Thor’s hammer (the Wan, and archaic form of the phalik creator Shang-Tê) is all-pervading, meeting the eye in all sorts of places, on the wrappers of medicines and sweetmeats, the stomachs or chests of idols, and the flanks of animals, upon dead walls, coins, &c.”1 It is, says Dr. Eitel, “ordinarily accepted as the accumulation of lucky signs, possessing ten thousand virtues, being one of the sixty-five mystic figures which are believed to be traceable in every one of the famous footprints of Budha.” This writer calls the various forms of Tor’s Hammer, its ordinary European development, and points out its prevalence amongst Kelts, Saxons, Skands, Danes, Germans, &c., who marked their sacred bells with it during the middle ages. He adds that this proves a common mythology “in ages long gone by, before the Aryan races had commenced their western wanderings, or the Shang dynasty had ceased to reign in Cbina (say 12th century B.C.)—coeval, in fact, with Kadmos, the reputed father of Western letters.” In Japan. we see the Svsati in the: ever present three rayed mystic Tomyê which is exhibited on all drums and lanterns especially at Matsuri or festal illuminations. It is, says Miss Bird, “the most common ornament in the empire of Japan,” appearing on “all terminal tiles of roofs .or walls, . . . . among the wood-carving and arabesques of temples,” besides being one of the badges of noble families. She was told it was a sign of all good influences, long life, &c.2 It is usually in red or white, and is simply a highly solar looking revolving figure such as the Manx Svasti would be if circles were drawn between the legs, and the whole enclosed in a circle. Such authors as Kerchers, Montfauçon, the Rev. T. Maurice and others have called attention to the Svastik or cruciform character of many Egyptian and Indian temples. We see the Hermetik cross prominent on the obelisks of Barberin, Pam-phylia and throughout Egpytian sculpturings; and the ruins of Axium display it as the symbol of life and Toth,4 Teut or Theus—our modern Teutahs and Theos. Mr. Thomas lays stress upon the discovery of crosses on Babylonian seals of 1500 B.C., but we believe that this will prove a comparatively modern date for crosses, Svastik and other; here however we must not pause to discuss such special points. Greeks, Babylonians and earlier peoples adorned their solo phalik Dio-nusos or Bakchos at a very early period with a wreath of perfectly plain crosses as we showed the god with his cup and budding branch in hand in our plate 5, page 104, vol. i. Here we give an en-laged sketch of the head as this appears in Hislop’s Two Babylons, where the reverend 1 China Rev., Sept. and Oct. 1876, p. 72. 2 Quoted from Notes and Queries on China and Japan, III., p. 98. 3 Japan II., 288. 4 Bruce’s Travels in Abyssinia and see Keane’s Towers and Temples of Ireland, p. 114-119.

The cross has been used from very ancient times in connection and rather phalikly so, with the planets. In our fig. 233, page 166, it appears in conjunction with the sun and moon to denote Jupiter, Saturn. Mars, Venus and Mercury, and as forming the tail and a pendant to a common circular form of the solar serpent. So Druids formed a Tau or cross out of their Jovine drui or sacred oak as sketched by us in fig. 19, p. 64, vol. i.; and Ezekiel told his tribe that all who put the mystic Tau upon their foreheads, (which many Hindus still do), would escape the murderous wrath of “the Yahuê”—their sun-god. The Ser-apeum or more modem Egyptian Tau, gives a man’s head instead of the Isian loop or handle of the old mythology, see p. 225 of our vol. i., where we quote King describing it as “the symbol of the generative power, found in Pompeii in juxtaposition with the phallus,” proving as he urges “the embodi-ment of the samc idea.”2 The ancient Tau is this dark central well-known looped cross, the base of which is probably the origin of the three-legged idea in connection with Isis or the female unity. The elaborate side crosses of this fig. 296 show how Budhism has degenerated into the old Budh or Bod faith, for that on the left is composed of scarcely diaguised phalli whilst the right one is a veritable “Tree of Life” bursting into seed like the Asyrian sacred tree seen standing before the Isian or castelated ark of Ishtar in our fig. 25, p. 75, vol. i. These Budhist crosses are kindly lent to me by Mr. Marcus Keane, who takes them from vol. x., p. 241 of Asiatic Researches. None who have read works upon the degenerate Budhism or rather Budho-Shintoism of Japan, will be surprised at these its phalik vagaries, nor wonder at the frailties of other and younger faiths, when so high and pure a religion has fallen so low. Here we must now close this chapter, which though long and called “Western Aborigines,” has, the reader may think, not gone far enough west, and yet too far and too much into our next chapter, “Eastern Aborigines.” We have however, been com-pelled to show the places and the conditions under which all early Western European tribes arose. The Atlantic is the only good and sufficient boundary of the old world; we have no records of any races crossing it, and only a few Eskimos gained the lost continent of the ancients, by the icy North. In our researches, we shall reach the new world through the old, and as our last stage, after sketching the religions of the more prominent Asiatik and Polyneaian peoples.

To our mind their religions were simply those of Aryan, Dravidian, and Turanian India, nay of all Asia—the land of their birth, childhood and manhood. From this in their old age they gradually fell away, not only from inherent weakness, but owing to the advance of knowledge and a wider acquaintance with more progressive elements and races; and finally succumbed in the presence of a highly and solidly-organiaed, dogmatic and written faith, infinitely superior to anything the western world had hitherto conceived, but which is nevertheless only another step in the never-ending process of human development.

This is more especially true of the ancient Aithiopian, Akadian, and Kuthite races, whom. we may designate Turanians, but who became more or less Shemitized by the conquering Shemites of Arabia, and then Aryanized by various waves of Aryans. These latter races by forcing the Turans from early ancestral seats of empire, advanced their civilization by widening their views and sympathies, and destroying their pristine, social and religious exclusive-ness, but it finally led to the Turans being all but absorbed into the nations they sojourned with. The Shemitik ascendancy threw upon all the coasts and ilands of the Mediteranean a strange medley of races, of whom the principa;.and for long a great and compact people, were the Phenicians, whilst the Aryan wave from its Asiatik centre threw forward, but more northerly, strong hordes of Skuths or Scythians, a name which we had better here consider in the Keltik significations of Scaoths—wanderers "},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

The results are somewhat confusing, and particularly when we have to remember, that though here probing deeply we find there is a depth quite beyond us; for it is not given to man to know his own genesis, nor indeed that of any original creation. Thus we have constant intimations even at the very remote, and all but pre-historic periods, of the earliest known Turanian, Shemitik and Aryan waves, of strong, resistant, and unknown populations of Autochthons (if we may presume to even here use this word), occupying all the continents and ilands of Europe, and fighting bravely for their hearths and homes. We have already pretty fully considered the early faiths of the Turanians and Shemites occupying the plains and water sheds of the Tigris and Euphrates, and will not here take up the special early faiths of the Nile valley and Iranian highlands, for the Egyptinn and Zoroastrian faiths require each a separate chapter, and so also do ancient and modern Hinduism and Budhism, even to their Chinese and Japanese developments. In this chapter we will treat only of the obscure and unwritten faiths of little known, but by no means unimportant races, who if they did not form, at least materially modified, the religions of their conquerors. Before however starting on such Asiatik researches, let us say a few words in regard to “the great dark continent,” which though now but little known, holds out a promise of great discoveries. AFRICA. Our indexes will show that Africa has not been neglected in these volumes though owing to its worships being like its peoples in an almost primeval state, and to our concern being to trace the tree to its roots, we have little to do with this great continent beyond notifying the existence of the roots. We know enough of African religions to assert that here Fet-ish, Tree, Phalus, and Yoni worship exist in their grossest forms. Not only is there a symbolism, bestial in the extreme, but the veritable organs are often displayed for worship, with snakes and all manner of fetishes. Speke found the organs of mares, asses and other very gross yoni forms, common as African house ornaments. And Burton complained that in Dahomey, the clay figure of a naked man of bestial and horrible proportions met him at every turn, and that all worshipped it as the God Legba or Egba. Africa like other lands has a “Tree of Life,” and from it “palm oil ever drips,” which can cure every ill of man or woman. Our wildest races in India exhibit more decency in their faith, yet these Africans know the usual veiled and conventional forms of Nature Worship, for we find with them the female principle or Woman herself fre-quently represented as a fish, cat, dove, &c. Bishop Calloway tells us of tribes bordering on our South African colonies “whose Creator U-tixo or U-kga-Mata is symbolized by a rayed sun and crescent,”— separate or conjoined, and by a cup in a circle or an eight rayed star—all common "},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"The Hottentot Solar Supreme God, and Satan. 451ancient Solo-phalik euphemisms.1 And Dr. Hahn, the Government Philologist at the Cape of Good Hope, in his late book upon Tsuni || Goam, the Supreme Being of the Khoi-khoi2 or Hottentots, tells us that this “Father of Fathers”—the above U-Tizo, is “the stream of the thunder-cloud,” who “giveth or withholdeth flocks and fruits,” and that like all solar gods “he died, several times, and several times rose again.” As with us so with the Africans; when the solar god “comes back there are great feast-ings and rejoicings: milk is brought from every kraal, and fat cows and ewes are slaughtered.” for “Tsui-goab is very rich; he gives rain, he makes the clouds, he lives in the clouds, and it is he who makes cows and sheep fruitful;” and hence it is that females are thought to be preferred by him. Dr Hahn usualy calls him Tsui-goab, but there is a click in this hyphen which is denoted in the title of his book by two vertical lines. The name has been very variously written and pronounced, as Tsoi-koap, Tshu-goam, Tui-qua, Ti-qua, Uti-kuah, U-Tixo, &c. This Supreme God has also an enemy or Satan, Gaunab, whom he is said to have vanquished but by no means obliterated, and from whose wound he still suffers; for Tsui-goab may be translated, “Sore Knee,” reminding us of the maimed Gods of all peoples, as of Solar Savitri, Hephaistos or Vulcan, Pan, and others. Yet though Tsui-goab’s name now signifies indeed “Lame Knee” this is held to have been an after accidental coincidence, for Goa-b means essentially “the Goer,” or “Approacher,” and Goara, “the day dawns;” whilst Tsu, though now meaning “Sore,” is also “the red coloured or bloody one,” terms applied to Siva and Durga. With Tsui-goab, however, it is only held to mean that he lives in a bright red heaven, and the Khoi Khoi when praying to him, turn to- wards the East and call him a “Heavenly Father,” and “Father of Fathers,” and they worship him on mounds, omphi or karns, to which stones are continually thrown, and offerings made of green boughs, honey and all produce. Whether therefore he is “the sore knee-ed,” and ancestor of “a great Healer” or not,3 Taui-goab is clearly the Hermes or Mercury of Southern. Africa, and a Siva, whom his children say under-stands all their wants, feelings and affections, for he assumed the role of a Son of Man, and once lived and died on earth, and had a wife and only son, and performed many wonderful works. His enemy Gau-nab is of course the opposite of all this. The one being “brightness,” and the other “Darkness, Night, Destruction,” which last, Gau it appears means. He is therefore “an evil spirit,” a ghost, ever going about to harm people and to take them to the long dark nigbt of “Death.” The Hottentot religion is not without its excellencies. Though “less dogmatic than ours,” says Prof. M. Müller, “it often seems marvellously practical,” whilst there are “traditions, legends, and poetry,” and the people “have refined feelings and a warm heart,” We know not, he adds, whether their “myths, legends and customs may not go back to a far more distant period than the literary records of any of the Aryan nations.” 1 Lon.

In a Legba shrine of three sacred courts, Captain Burton found depicted on the door, a leopard, fish, serpent and turtle, and a male and female figure of Obatala, the dual “God of Life;” and opposite to them was “a phalus conjoined (in coitu) with the female emblem.” He speaks also of the charms over doors and tents, being in Northern Africa often the actual organs, of a mare, cow or camel, “to avert,” so the people said, “the evil eye or to bestow upon them health and prosperity;” so that here, as elsewhere, the Phalik God is a Jupiter Salutaris, as was the Ier-u-Salem of Syria and the Suleman of all Asia, for he was no Solomon as the ignorant often imagine. Our horse shoes hung upon doors continue unwittingly the same ideas. Egba makes us think of Egle; the daughter of the ophite demi-god of health—Eskulapios or Salus; whilst the African women attending the numerous serpent shrines remind us of Virgil’s description of Hygeia feeding the symbolic deities before the altar of her affections out of her patera, as here seen in the Egyptain ideograph given by Cooper,1 and in our fig. 33, p. 97, Vol. I. Virgil says she sometimes appears with solar cock on her right hand, and the rod of the Asklepian serpent deity in her left.2 The sacred serpents of Africa have still their temples, rites and sacrifices, human and other, just as they once had in Egypt, and still have in many parts of Asia. Bryant shows that Aithi-op-ia, a land of Solo-ophites, had for its first king, one Arwe “the Serpent,” one of whose titles was Nagash, corresponding to the Aryan and non-Aryan terms for the sacred Serpent of India, the Naga and Negus, and to the Heb. Nachash. The idea which runs through the whole subject of Ophiolatry is apparent from the annexed Hebrew words and the same may be gathered from Akadian and Egyptian; where Naka or Neka is “the Great Serpent,” and Neph, the breath, soul, spirit, and a god. The ancient Arabs called their Kings Nagashi, and the Greek Bas-ileus, which has been elsewhere enlarged on.2 This was equivalent to our kingly title “Defender of the Faith”—their old serpent faith, which was enshrined in every district of their kingdom, as well as on the summit and along the precipices of their akropolis. But an older faith than the Greek is here, for the base of Bas-il-eus is in Bhas, according to the Sanskrit serpent worshipper, “the Light and Splendor, a Ray, Obelisk, and Cock”—the Apolo-Python of those old races who anticipated Greeks in the adop-tion of shrines and deities, the meaning of which they as little understood as they did of Apolo the Skuthik Ab-Eloh and the Ap-Ilu of Turano Akads.4 Egypt knew him 1 Serpent Myths of Egypt, Victoria Inst., from which we purchased these and many other genuine monumental figures. 2 Virgil’s Æniad, vii. 1057. 3 Basileus is treated of in our Vol. I. as at pages 295, 359, 376, &c. 4 We therefore spell Apollo, Ap-olo.

We here show him from the gates of Luxor carrying the sun or universe in his mighty folds, and symbolising it in his inflated breast. He is here termed “the soul or life of Ra,” “pro-duced spontaneously by his rays;” and it is said of Ouro, as of all phalik gods, that his sting insures immortal life, for though “he kills he makes alive again.” Still does the Hindu worship Bhāsant, “the Sun or Male Moon God,” and calls his Solo-phalik Siva, Bhāsava and Bhās-kāra or holder of the Bhas—the Arabian Phalo, Greek Phallos, Egyptian Basah, mené or man; and the Hebrew Basar, which they circumcised as a sacred object alike with the Yahu, why, and his Yahué.1 Bhâsava though the Linga, is Mahā-Deva, now spiritualized and purified by the literary Hindu, as the Hebrew Basar becomes in “the Word made Flesh”—or the Logos and Sarx of later Biblical writers. Greeks also gradually dropped their Bas-il god or Solo-phalik and serpent idea, and called their “God” “Theos, who however was for long only a slightly metaphorized Theut or Teut; indeed Plato explained that Theus was derived from Toth the Menê or Obelisk, or serpent-god-man, whom Abysinians idolized as a nude man, with the head of a dog or serpent. Central Europe called him Tiu, Téu, Théut-ait or Teutatis, the Ait or phalik-Heart-idea of the Egyptians, from which Christians have inherited their traditions of “the Sacred Heart” of their Apolo. Suidas calls Theuth or Theus “a form of Ares, the Sun-lion,” which is known to literary Arabs as Teus-Arez, and to Skuths as the early phalik Ars or M’Ars—their great Quiris or javeline “God of Battles,” and Fertilizer of men, their flocks and herds. Arabs worshipped him at Petra as a Lithos melas, Atupotos, Tetra-gonos, which popularly meant “The dark stout formless one,” the God of Nature, who as “the square black pillar” requires no image, and looks like Janus on all sides. We show him in our figs. 175 and 2812 as depicted in Central and Northern Europe. Ophiolatry does not seem to have been disturbed in Abysinia (Ops-inia ?) until some Christians converted “the Great Dragon of Axum,” that is its Chief; and this did not much affect Northern Abysinians, who retain “to this day the worship of Serpents, Trees, and the Heavenly Hosts;” whilst the shepherds, or mass of the people, still cling to ’Ad-’Ad or Hâbâb, an ophite “Father of Fathers,” the Aba-Ab or Ops-ab, whose image—a red Lingam—Mahamad broke down in the Al-kaba of Măka.

The Whyda sacred snake is, as the Rev. Mr. Deane wrote, “perfectly harmless and to be seen in all houses . . . It leaves its young ones in the very beds of the people, from which it is the height of impiety to dislodge them.” The snake’s house is the finest in the land and it has most of the furnishings of the later Faiths; and within it are held most of the religious rites, fetes, and sacrifices, human and other. To it pilgrimages are made, and here attend Priests and Priestesses called “children of god,” who bear the deity’s mark or symbol indelibly on their bodies, reminding us that Yahuê also required this of his people, for the basar had to be circumcised to him, and sometimes the Tau cross also affixed to those whom he was asked to spare. There was a day when the Jah of Sabaoth and the IAO of early Christians was exhibited as an ithyphalik deity,1 like the African Legbe and Egyptian Khem,2 with serpents for his feet and with all the veiled emblems of Figs 303 and 304.—FULL SIZED VIEW OF A TEMPLE IMAGE OF SIVA, IN BRASS, AS AGNI, THE CREATOR AND DESTROYER. birds, rods, and looped crosses around him.

Horus as well as Khem frequently so appears, and we see the India Siva as Agni doing the same in these speaking figures of the god under the form of Fire or overpowering Passion, a figure we promised in a former chapter to try and exhibit to the readet. This Eastern Legbe, Siva or Jah, is here seen creating and destroying in exuberance of joy and clothed and armed with all the insiguia of Life and Death. He has passed through one creation of life that is one female whose body clings to his neck and droops flaccidly around him. and is impressing with his pad or foot (the Pràbat or phalus) his image on another woman. His countenance is contorted with passion and his flaming head, ever a phalik emblem, is bright with Agni’s rays and sacred gems. In one hand he holds the casket of life or womb, and in the other his own symbol the crown capped mace buried in the Concha-Veneris, whilst his seat is like that of most African gods on a strange aquatic animal representing the waters of fertility “over” which, like the Al-e-im of Genesis he may be said “to brood.” Every rude African race could understand and worship such an image as this, if coarsely enlarged, although Whydas, Eboes, and Dan-hsinuos are scarcely yet educated enough to under-stand the fulness of thought here so skilfully shown by the Indo-Aryan. The figure is in fact brimful of similitudes, from its Lotus bed and creative Padma and “Foot” (that veiled form which has permeated so many faiths), to its serpent garland and hair of fire interspersed with skulls. The serpent deity retains in Whyda his almost univernal name and character. He promotes all strange and nefarious love intrigues, especially at the joyous harvest season, when, personifying evil thoughts or passions, he. prowls about the fields (or his priests do), seizing females whom “he deprives of reason.” These are then said to be incapacitated for return to their parents, so “they are sent to the King’s hospital”— no doubt a den of debaucbery, and “there they remain under the care of the priests till cured.” They are then cautioned that “if they mention a single circumstance of what happened in these dens of villany, they will be secretly poisoned. . . . . In most cases the possession of the devil or evil one is a concerted plan between the women and the priests.”1 This is confirmed by modem travellers, but when Whyda was conquered by Dahomey some slight changes in the rites of the faith took place, though matters could scarcely be improved by such conquerors. The EBOES worship a sacred lizard, and in 1831 they called their king OBI, reminding us of the Royal Asp of Egypt, the Oubos, Oupis, or Ophis,2 and Obion, the solar serpent god, and Ob-Adur the solar serpent, who was once good and a Horos, but fell from heaven like this solar serpent god of the Nile and our Satan. Along the Gold Coast and lower Congo, superstitious and weakly Portuguese Chris-tians have long forbidden serpent worship; and misrepresented what they did not under-stand, but beyond their limits it continues to flourish.

The crocodile and other half aqueous guanas and serpents were representatives of wintry Typhon, and Greeks said that from crocodile’s teeth sown by Kadmus sprang up great chiefs, no doubt meaning great Ophiolaters. AGOYE, the “god of the councils” of Whyda, is symbolized by a semi-human serpent, out of the top of whose head comes a javelin crossed by a lunette and a crocodile. The base springs from three crocodiles on each side, with a serpent and flaming fire, whilst on the shaft a crocodile is climbing up like the serpent on the Eskulapian rod. On the coast of Guinea the serpent temples are in sacred groves, where are offered to them specifically stated sacrifices, such as hogs, sheep, fowls, goats, &c., according to the season. “From Libtria to Benzuela, if not further,” says Sir John Lubbock,1 the serpent is the chief deity of Africa, and to it the people resort in times of drought, sickness, and other calamities,” just as Rome once did. “No negro,” continues this author, “would intentionally injure a serpent, and any one doing so by accident would assuredly be put to death. Some English Sailors once having killed one which they found in their house, were furiously attacked by the natives, who massacred them and burned the house. All over the country are small huts built on purpose for the snakes, which are attended and fcd by old women; but there also are temples . . . . of considerable magnificence . . . . and with numerous attendants . . . . each with a special snake.” It is rather suspicious, continues Skertchly, confirming much that Deane and others said a hundred years before his day, “that any young females who may be ill, are taken off to the snake’s house to be cured.” In the Dan-hgbweho or snake temples of Dahomey, there are, says this later writer, various other emblematic deities, and full ecclesiastical establishments with regular rites and rituals. He found the Priests, and Priestesses or Dan-hsinos, living on the fat of the land, having flesh, grain, oil, and wine in abundance. The shrines were usually circular thatched structures with conical roofs, where amidst the bambus and grass the holy reptiles delight to dwell. There are some suggestively strange vessels in these sanctuaries, viz. “twin porringers and holy cups and ladles,” like those of the Levitical or Judeo-ophite dispensation:2 also “painted tree stumps, stones and cones.” But no traveller with a sufficiently intimate know-ledge of eastern faiths has yet investigated the true meaning of these symbols, and until this is done it is impossible to get at the esoterik significance, nature, and mysteries of the Faith.

The cones remind us of the double phalus of Nismes and the winged sun of Egypt and Asyria, but in Africa it probably stands for “the god Ajarama of the whitewashed stump,” On the walls of this temple were drawings of men, birds, snakes and divers animals, reminding us of the worship of the Jews as denounced by Ezekiel in the 6th century B.C.1. The attendents on the sacred serpents were here dressed like most priests in long tunics, which, when Skertchly saw them, were white bedaubed with blood, marking the service of the sexual god, but perhaps so only at one of his particular fetes, like that of the Indian Hulè when the white garments of all good Hindus are besmeared with red, his special color. The priests wore their hair in long dishevelled snaky tresses, tied up at the ends with tags of a whitish sort of fez, and these when blown about by the wind made them look like veritable snaky Medusas and Bakchantes. The poor human victims of the deities are often offered up with much cruelty, though excuses are usually given that they are criminals, or have injured or crossed the path of a straying deity. In this last case the victim is first half roasted and then beaten to death with clubs. In Old Kalabar, some 500 miles W.S.W. of Whyda, in the northern recess of the Guinea Coast, Egbo is the universal “Bush God,” and esteemed “a supernatural and supreme power, who can be summoned to the aid of his people on any emergency, and especially must he be so in the making and proclaiming of all laws, when his priests or Idems are called upon to intercede for, or punish the people.” It sis a duty of the Idems”to punish all who disobey the Egbo law,” which, as in the case of our churches, means the priest’s laws, or their own ideas of their God’s laws. However the tribes may quarrel amongst themselves, it appears that they are unanimous in supporting their “Egbo Institution.”2 It will be remembered that the fiery JAH or Al-Shădăe of the Old Testament was similarly summoned, argued with and moved by the Mosaik Idems, whether in Egypt or the desert. He lectured or killed the tribes just as the Kalabar Egbo does, and thus some conclude that Jews were then in the Kalabar stage of barbarism. Egbo is indeed still called by several of the titles of Yahué. He is the “maker and preserver of all things,” “the Almighty,” and philo-sophically “the Incomprehensible One.” The Kalabar also Acknowledge the existence of other and very nearly as great gods; just as Jews said “Yahuê was their Eloh-im,” or one of the Al-e-im, so Egbo is “the One God,” or “the One Abasi, and also the Abasi-Ibum,” or “Ever great Abasi.” It is he who supervises the universe, 1 Ezekiel viii. and p. 106 of our vol.

Mr Walker found six of these Eloh-im in the city of Kalabar; and besides these, each house has its own Lares and Penates, or Ek-pen-yona, on a sacred mount or omphe, with a skull—a suitable yoni or womb-idea—on its summit, and rising from the omphe, a pillar pole or banner-stand, carrying another skull or some similar strange device. These veritable “Calvaries” are to be seen in the entrance-yard of every good house, just as we find similar objects near the dwellings and fields of Indian aboriginal tribes; indeed, the term Ek-pen-yona might read in India, “The One Lord of the Yoni,” which it appears to signify. We have elsewhere drawn attention, as did the learned Major Moore some half century ago in his Hindu Pantheon, to the great number of African words and names, especially of deities, towns, rivers, mountains and natural phenomena, which would pass current in India even to-day, and far more so a thousand years ago; and this supports some arguments which follow, as to a Meru-opes or Aithi-op-ian race of sun and serpent worshippers overrunning both continents, not only in the earliest pre-historic period, but before languages had reached their classified stage, and also as to Aithiopes being the instructors alike of Shemitik and Aryan races. The Kalahar word A-Bāsi is one which Indian aborigines would readily accept for their Bhāsava Deva, and as applicable to their “Father Asi, As, Es, or Esh,” the Lord of Agni or Passion, to whom they still offer goats, fowls, &c. On such occasions the Kalabars call him Isu-Ekpo, which is translated to us as “Spirit of Procreation,” but of which we would very much like to have the detailed etymology and character-istics. This Hermes is generally symbolized by the suggestive Banāna. but if the deity is worshipped in a female form, her emblems are large, roundish yams, eggs, and such like forms set up in a sacred enclosure. We have closely inspected many a fenced-off quarter or “Croft” in the farm-yards, fields and new forest clearings of Indian aboriginesa, dedicated to the “Gude Man,” as the Scotch call his degenerate type; and have also seen numerous modified forms of this African deity in the Christian erections, bearing rude images of Christs, virgins, angels and saints, in the hills of Spain, and Italy, and the Tyrolese Alps. But all such are rather the fetishes than the idols of the rude peasantry. There is no Totemism here, nor in any objects, however formless or rude, which are intended to represent deity or deified personages, or ideas of these. It is only through ignorance of this whole subject that Bruce called such true Sivaism by the names of Tree, Block or Stone worship. He was led to think that “from north to south. and east to west, Africa is full of Tree worship,”1 because he found trees adorned with streamers, flags or tags, and with altars at their base, where meats, grain, wine and oil were offered. If we knew the exact peculiarities, species, and history of such trees, 1 Bruce’s Travels, Abysinia, iv. 35; vi. 344.

Forest Shrines. 459we should no doubt find that they were the representatives of an Elohe or Yahuê, for there is great similarity betwean this African worship and the Arabian rites under Sinai, on the “unhewn altars” of the Judean wanderers, or beside their Ark box, which repre-sented the Supreme, only under a different name.1 Similar ceremonies with fire and sacrifice were common to both sides of the Eruthrean Sea, and we should certainly expect the religious rites of the settled state of Abysinia to be superior to those which were practised 3300 years ago by “a mixed multitude” of Egyptian and Arabian wanderers, in Arabia Petrea. With neither people were the gods super-natural—out of, or beyond the universe. They were true parts of the Mighty Whole, souls of the world or nature. In both cases they were “the spirits or life of all creation,” dwelling alike in mountains, deserts, rivers or forests, but especially in umbrageous groves, or by venerable trees. Though he could not so express himself, it is clear the African often felt with Seneca, “that when he walked in thick groves planted with wondrous trees, excluding the very light by their interwoven boughs; the vast height, retired secrecy, and unbroken gloom solemny impressed his mind with the conviction of a present deity.” But the African God was everywhere a terrible and awe-inspiring one, like the Yahuê of Sinai, and very far removed from the loving and merciful Father of more philosophic peoples. Our gods are but our best conceptions of goodness, greatness and power, and as far as our ability goes, we construct shrines for them characteristic of their virtues or it may be vices. So the silent gloom of the dreaded and pathless forest solemnized. the mind of the rude African, and was to him what the lofty and dimly-lighted cathedral or temple was to more civilized men. He heard as it were a solemn chant and requiem in the sighing of the wind through the high leafy vaults, and was soothed; the low murmur of the brook, and the splash of waters, mingling with the song of birds, were to him a heavenly choir; whilst the terrors of nature, only too familiar and incomprehensible, made him bow awe-stricken before “the Great Spirit,” making him cry, like the Jews of old, that “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,” as it certainly is of much thoughtfulness. We speak not here from personal knowledge of Africans, but from. a long and intimate acquaintance with rude peoples, far less emotional, passionate, poetic and song-loving than they; and we feel convinced that the African too has often experienced these almost common feelings of humanity, though he has not apparently, except in America, been able to pen a thought in prayer or song. But his history has yet to be written. Let us now pass on eastwardly in our researches regarding Asiatik aborigines. AITH-I-OPS or ÆTHIOPIANS.—To avoid repetition we beg a careful perusal of pre-vious pages noted below, concerning the Aithiops, and remnants of this wondrous old race.2 1 Cf.

We can even yet see traces of them. extending from Western lreland to more Eastern Asia, where they may be clearly identified with those whom anthropologists describe as “Indo-Caucasians,” “strange aborigines,” &c. When isolated and conquered, or swamped amidst unknown multitudes, they became de--Turanized, that is Aryanized or Shemitized, as did Pelasgi and Phenicians in the West and some Drāvidians and others in India. As Aithiopes or Kushites however, they long remained like our “Indian aborigines,” more worthy of the name of “Non-Aryans” or “Turanians,” or perhaps we should say Alarodians. When known to us in the West they probably spoke like Egyptians, a Shemitized tongue, and just as their worships formed the base of the religions which were to dominate the world, so their influence did much to frame that class of languages of which the Shems, Shams or Sabeans of Arabia were the chief developers, and which first attained to national importance on the rise of the Mesopotamian kingdoms in the 17th century B.C.—one of the cyclic periods marked in our chart. This and the two previous centuries had been with Aithiopes periods of great perturbation, disturbing their rule even in Northern India and Baktria. For the Aryan hordes of Central Asia were at that time working south, and seriously invading all Turanian and Shemitik nationalities, and this with the Arabian move-ment in Arabi Irak, broke up the continuity of Aithiopian Empire and forced them onwards. Our cyclic clock had announced another cycle, during which the de-scendants of Eruthrus and Kush were no longer to rule all the Indian and Arabian seas. Their dominant classes were now pressed westward, and those who had until then controlled the world from India to Iberian Spain, now collected into small king-doms, like those the Hamathites of Karchemosh, the Kheti, Pharaohs of the lower Nile, the Tyr-rhenians, &c. The race were still however, for a thousand years to hold Western Asia, Northern Africa, and much of Europe, and to teach the coming races of these countries, arts, religion and civilization. It took 1500 years to do this, and even then we do not find that the taught were equal to their old instructors. These travelled and busy Aithiopes seem to have known the world from the far Eastern Aurea Chersonesus and Sinus Kalchidicus to the great Atlantik ile, and very much better than any old Greeks or even later Romans. Indeed our studies of these subjects lead us, like Professor Baldwin, to believe, that Aithiopes were the rulers and instructors of the world from before 6000 B.C. to the disturbed era we have spoken of, or say for 4000 years before Aryan or Shemitik ascendency. Owing to the all-per-vading dominance of classical literature and predilections—to fables fancy and false etymologies, ever looking through Greek or Sanskrit spectacles—Europe has been much misled as to the true significance of history in regard to the earliest Aryan and Aryanized peoples. It has even become a thankless task to try and dissipate the historical darkness of the Turanian ages prior to the 8th century B.C."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Aithi-opes.

We are here also somewhat hampered at the outset by the too strained orthodox etymology of the Aithiopian name; for although prepared to concede that Aith-ops were red, ruddy, and fiery in hue and nature, yet we also see in the name, a faith eponym, and do not think that it was only due to a burnt face or peculiar eye, but also to fire and serpent wor-ship, and to the ardent, fiery and energetic nature of this early race, that they were called Aithiops. They were “Lords of Men,” and from their skill, “Magi,” Magicians or “Great Ones,” and “Con-trollers of the Elements.” But the Aith of the West, had long before Greek days been, as Liddell and Scott state, the Indh or Indra of the Eastern world, whose followers, as developed in the Aryan nomadik singers of Vedik hymns, of say 2500 B.C., had then tried to replace grosser faiths by sun and fire worship. We find these Aith-ops or Aitho-ops described as fiery, furious, sparkling and ardent, like the lion, bull, horse and eagle; and seeing that they are their name came down from ages before Greek was Greek, or even Sanskrit was Sanskrit, we would rather here trust to faith designations than to names derived from the hue of the skin. Undoubtedly Red or Phoinik was a royal colour, and red blood was equivalent to our present idea of blue blood; by the early Typhon and all his race (once great and good) were red, and Osiris and Vishnu were blue-black or Krishnaik, and Siva and Horos white gods; yet none of these or their followers were so called from their colour. Their names were faith-names, like those of Christians, Teutons, Hindus, &c., and seeing the prominence of the faith and leadership of Aithi-ops, we hold that they were similarly named. Their Ait, Aith, Ath or Athé worship is fitly sym-bolized in our fig. 297 prefacing this chapter, and in this the commonest of Egyptian figures, when the Uræ was the Aur, Ur, or Light God, and the burning, red and fiery one;1 or in “The Germinator,” fig. 306. The most ancient as well as modern divisions of the human race, describe man as Red, White and Black; or Turanian (and Mongolian), Iranian (or Kaukasian or Arian) and Negritik, and we shall find the use of this in tracing these early Indh or Aith worshippers. They were the true Merus, Mer-opes, and first of Tartars and Mongols; and in their land were developed Arians and Skyths, of whom said Greeks, there were at least thirty tribes. Humboldt saw the so-called red race in the red picture writings of Mexiko, and the Etruskan reliefs of Tarquini; and Niebuhr saw Aithio-pians in the red Egyptian paintings of Theban kings, and in the copper-coloured figures without beards, of the caves of Bang near Malwa in Central India, which, be it 1 Cooper’s Serpent Myths, p. 18."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

I should have supposed it had been dug,” he adds, from the ruins of Thebes.” In early Greek times, “the Red Thracian” was passing West through lands which he had long ruled, to settle in further Etruria, so this may account for Etrusko-Aithiop affinities, and why Jove was painted vermilion on high festival daysm, and why noble Romans also so adorned themselves on great occasions. Adam and Adāmahites were thought by Josephus and others to be “the red earth ones,” but our better know-ledge of Eastern faiths, tongues and modes of thought, tells us that there was an esoterik meaning behind this, which makes Adam like many other old words, a mere term of gender, as elsewhere explained. Herodotos said that the Aithiops who colonized Egypt were Kolki, but the colonization of Egypt takes us back to the unknown dawn of history, and to such gropings as are detailed in our tabular statement, p. 396. Other writers call Aithiops “dark Kaukasians who had become reddy-brown by intermarriage with Arabs.” But who were they? This is to argue in a circle, the centre and circumference of which always turns out Aithiopik. They were, said Diodoros, the colonizers and humanizers of the whole ancient world. It was they who formulated language, government and religion, with its sacrifices, deities, holy rites aud rituals, and estab-lished the altar, public and private. They instituted the sacred ties of family, and started those higher intellectual pursuits, which aimed at the knowledge of the heavens above and the earth beneath. It was their royal blue-black blood or dusky forefathers who originated the dark Isis and “Ever-Virgins” of all peoples—even now so revered; the black Di-Ana Multimammæ of Western Asia (our fig. 107, p. 234), the negritik Budha (fig. 85, p. 206, Vol. I.), the blue-black Krishna, and other like divine symbolisms of the East and West. Their ithyphalik Cham or Kem, of the land of Khem, is the ever indecent Priapus of the Nile—a “god of increase,” whom we here show as decently figured by Samuel Sharpe, and to that extent imperfect.2 He is the swathed or pillar-like god, whose hieroglyphik emblem is “the bolt” of the lock or yoni—the Min, Man-gul or Mauoul of the Hebrews, as the lascivious Jewish maiden represents him in Cants. v. 5. As the obeliskal man, mane, or min, he here holds the whip, which with phalik gods signifies the Quickener of exciter, and his fit consort was the Phoinician Ken, given in our fig. 214, p. 84.

Lenormant. in and about Armenian Aria, but far away N.E on the Pamir or “Roof of the world,” where, too, he justly locates the Meru of Sanskritists and the Hyperborean Mer-opes, whose ruler was “Mer-opis king of the Ethiopians, the moat pious and virtuous of men, the husband of Kly-menê and mother of Phæthon.” This concession is a con-siderable Biblical surrender on the part of a Roman Catholic; but, like the clerical explanation of the six days of creation, it is said to be clear from the Bible itself. Anyhow the scholar here speaks and we therefore honor him and quite agree with a long quotation which he makes from the learned work of Professor A. de Quatrefages.3 It is so much to the point that we must here give it:— “We know,” says this eminent professor, “that there exists in Asia a vast region, enclosed to the S. and S-W. by the Himâlayas, on the W. by the Bolor, on the N-W. by the Alla-Tau, and on the N. by the Altai Mountains and its offshoots, on the E. by the Kingkhan, and on the S. and S-E. by the Felina and Kuen-Loun. Judging of it by what exists at the present day, this great central region may be regarded as having contained the cradle of the human race. In fact the three fundamental types of all the human race are represented in the populations around this region. The negro races are the furthest removed from it, but have nevertheless marine stations, in which they are found either as pure or mixed races, from the Kiousaiou to the Andeman islands. On the continent they have mingled their blood with nearly all the inferior castes and classes of the two gigantic peninsual; they are still found pure in each of them. They ascend as far as Nepal, and spread to the West as far as the Persian Gulf and Lake of Zareh, according to Elphinstone. “The yelow race, pure, or mixed here and there with white elements, seems alone to occupy the area in question. The circumference of this region is peopled by it to the N., the E., the S-E., and the W. In the S. it is more mixed, but it none the less forms an important element of the population. The white race, by its Allophyle representatives, seems to have disputed the possession of even the central area itself with the yellow race. . . . . At the present day in Little Tibet, small islands with white populations have been pointed out. . . . . “No other region on the face of the globe presents a similar union of the extreme types of the human race distributed around a common centre. . . . . One of the weightiest (considerations) is drawn from philology. The three fundamental forms of language are found in the same region and in analogous connections. In the centre and S-E. of our area, the monosyllabic languages are represented by the Chinese, the Anamite, the Siamese and the Tibetan. As agglutinative languages, we find in the N-E. and N-W. the group of the Ougro-Japanese; in the S. that of the Drávidians and Malays, and in the W. the Turkish languages. Lastly the Sanskrit, with its derivatives, and the Iranian language, represent in the S. and S-W. the flexible languages. “With the linguistic types accumulated around this central part of Asia, all languages are connected, either by their vocabulary or their grammar. . . . We know that several philologists, M. Maury among others, established an intimate connection between the Drávidian languages and Australian idioms. . . . .

Here, we think, the first huamn beings appeared and multiplied, and overflowing as from a cup, poured themselves out in human waves in all directions.” And this, we would add, was evidently due to a gradual geogonic movement, such as the up-rising of the central continent above its old water springs. The surface waters tended westward, and men necessarily followed them; lakes dried up and others formed, filled and overflowed, devastating vast tracts and giving rise to all those legends of “Floods,” more or less extensive. The inundations would be most severe South and West of the Kaspian, until the pent up waters burst through the great gorge of the Dardanels and Bosporus into the Mediteranean—a sea largely formed probably by this uprising—combined with a similar move upwards of the African and Arabian Continents. See page 401 of this volume. The earliest legends of the worshippers of Seth or Set, call these Aithi-opes or Meru-opes, Kuths or Cushites, the “Sons of Ham,” of whom we have an. indecent Noachian legend, like to the phalacisms of his early prototype the ithyphalik Kem of the Nile. “Ham was the father of all Canaans,” which is possibly a Shemitik corruption of Chams or Chens, for m and n, like H, ch, K, Kh, or gh, are often interchangeable.1 These Aithi-opo-Kuths ruled, according to “sacred and profane history,” through their fabled Eruthrus—their Abram and Noah-all Egypt, Arabia and the East, but resided mostly by their two Eruthrean Seas. All races have largely built their faiths and civilizations on Aithiopik foundations, and so too have largely benefited by inter-mixture with their royal red and “blue-black” blood; and not least, that “great mixed multitude,” which2 left these Mitz-Ra-im or Mithras worshippers, after living with them we are told some 400 years, to wander for another long period amidst their desert brethren, and finally to settle on their Aithiopian Highlands of Syria. The El-Is-Râ-ites boasted of marrying their connections the Moabites and Midians or Madins —at one time seizing 32,000 of their maidens, 32 of which they gave to their God. From the history of the marriage of their leader also, we see that they as Saturnites, worshipped the same deities, and became intimately mixed up with the Syro- Aithiopik tribes; ten at least of the so-called twelve tribes of Yahus being entirely absorbed into a debris of Aithiopes, who, in time became Shemitized and Aryanized, just as the Yahus would become Aryanized during their long periods of enslavement to Aryan peoples. Our cultured English Jew, is a veritable Aryan. In Ezekiel’s time the Mitz-Raim or Mith-Ra-ites, had apparently ceased to be considered Aithiops, for that seer wrote that the former were to be laid waste from the bordern of Syene (2nd Cataract), to the frontier or Kush, or to those Syro-Phenician countries which the Greeks of that period likewise called Aithiopia. About the 12th century B.C., according to writings on the palace of Ramses, a Kouschite race 1 Thus ambassador has been and still is, in European tongues, enbassatour, inbassetour, or enbassotour, and thus on may become aum, om, and am, &c. 2 Exod. xviii.

No doubt the enterprising Aithiopes of Yemen constantly traded to, and probably held lands on the Nubian coasts and from thence entered upper Egypt. and fought with their brethren of lower Egypt; which might lead to the idea that Nubians were Aithiops and to Chamites standing for black peoples, instead of Fire worshipping Aiths or Solar Ams, Am-alks, Am-ons, &c. In Koptik, we here of Kshi, or K-ou-s-ch peoples, down to the 4th century, but as the very necessary prominent vowel u or oo is here absent, these may not be Kushis. In the records of the XVIIIth Dynasty, say 1600 B.C., we know of Aithiopes who appear to have been dark, or like to swarthy Non-Aryan Asiatiks, or Phoinikes or Beni-Anaks, and. other Syro-Arabian tribes, but never do we hear of them as curly headed Africans. The Greeks claimed Aithiopik descent for their Prometheus and Zeus, saying that they were “Lords of a mighty race who once ruled over both Eruthrean seas and the Armenian Higblands.” From their languages and mythologies came all such names and ideas as below,2 varied and contorted as we find them among Shemitik Baby- lonians, Asyrians, Phoinikes, Arabians, &c., and among ancient Indo-Kuths and Mexikans. Rawlinson agrees with Bryant that “the uniform voice of primitive antiquity described the Aithi-ops as a single race, dwelling on the shores of the Southern ocean . . . . . from India to the pillars of Hercules,” which phali we may be certain were their divine emblems.3 All the early public works of Egypt were, adds Bryant, con-structed by Aithiopes, including the Maturea Canal, and it was their kindred peoples who founded all the ancient cities in the land of Khemi, for they were Khemites. In Arabia. they were Saba-ites, Ads or Adites, names so well known in ancient India and mid Asia. Their deitiea were the fiery solar Aith, Indh, or Ath gods, whom Pur-gi or Phrygians adopted in their Atis and Até and Greeks in their Athene. The base of the worship lay in the fiery Ak or Akhu of Akads, developed at Erech or M‘Ir-ek by Urs and Aurites, whose Supreme God was El, Elu, or Ilu. They were devoted Argha-ites or Arkites, whose shrines their Egyptian brethren elaborated in such forms as we give over leaf, and have further illustrated and explained at pages 191 to 201 of Vol. I. These Aiks are perfect arcana of thair whole mythologies, containing within all the insignia of the worship of nature’s creative energies, and outwardly exhibiting as much of them as was good for the race to dwell upon.

I., the very same object the Hindu worships to-day; for Siva is still commonly termed the Arga-Nât, Ark God, or God in the Argha—that sacred lamp of which he is the wick, or “the mast in the boat.” Arkite shrines were not confined to Egypt or Western Asia, but like the Aithi-opes themselves were found in southern Italy, which some urge was their Ait-el-ia. Strabo says that “up to the 5th ccntury B.C. Aithi-opes ruled all the world south of the Grecian kingdoms, whilst Skuths dominated all to their north;” and we thus see that Aithiops or de-aithiopized peoples—still attached to and proud of their old lineage—had at this period met Aryans and Shemites at all points in a more or less deadly struggle. Ephoros, the Greek historian of the following century, wrote that, “If the whole world were divided into four parts, the Indians would. be found in possession of that towards the East, the Aithiops that towards the South, the Kelts that towards the West, and the Skuths that towards the North.” “The Aithiops,” he continued, “have extended themselves from the wintry tropic in the East (China, where we still find ancient races called Kutus or Kusis), to the extremity of the West,”1 that is to Spain, Armorika and Ireland. Now Ephoros lived in the times of Alexander the Great, and knew much of India; and he and others give us facts, though less than the whole facts, which enable us however to see, that long prior to Aryan ascendency either in India, Baktria or Europe, there was an old Aithiopik civilization and religion, superior to anything that Aryans developed, even in Vedik hymns, till about the age of Gotama “The Budha,” or of the philosophies which date from times immediately preceding him. It is univernally acknowledged in the case of Egypt, that nothing which the Aryan Vedantists of India could show, can compare with the arts, architec-tures, rituals, and theophilosophik liternture of the Nile;; or even with the rich mytho-logies, hymns, and prayers of the tablet literature of the proto-Kaldean and Babylonian 1 Prehistoric Nations, p. 60.

Ignorance of Shemites and Aryans. 467races of Akads, Kuths or Aithiops, as these have come down to us engraved on stone and clay, at least 3000 years before we can find a single trace of Indo-Aryan writing, or even of the mention of any writing materials, as ink, pens, or engraving tools, bark paper or books. The Aryan darkness is also as complete in regard to the arts, architecture, and general civilization of early Aryan India. Mr Fergusson tells us in his His. of Architecture,1 that all “the most remarkable series of monuments the world possesses, were built by people of Turanian race,” who were “the first to people the whole world.” Writing as it were geologically, he adds: “they were the sub-structure of the whole world, and occupied the vast portion of its surface:—every-where underlying all the others, and affording their disintegrating materials, to form the more recent strata that now overlie and frequently obliterate them—in appear-ance at least.” Speaking as an historian of architecture, he says that “in the age of the Pyramid builders, all the arts (developed by these Aithiopik races) were as perfect and as complete, as they were when the country fell under the domination of the Romans.” And this is not so in the West only; for in China, he thinks “the earliest works are as perfect—in some respects more so—as those of to-day;” whilst in Tartary, Northern and Southern India, Barma, Siam, Java, &c., he finds “Turanian monu-ments of dimensions unsurpassed . . . . . and displaying a degree of taste and skill the most remarkable.” Whilst, in regard to the Aryans, who gradually supplanted these great artizans and architects, he finds, as in the West so in the East, they took thousands of years to equal the. Turanians, even though they had their works before them, and the builers to instruct and aid them. He states that, “no Shemite and no Aryan. built even a tomb that could last a century, or was worthy to remain so long,” Even the arts developed by Pelasgi, Etruskans and Kelts, he attributes to their admixture of Turanian blood; indeed he thinks the former were “the last men of the Turanians . . . . . and displacers of more purely Turanian tribes,” from whom they also borrowed their religions and mythologies.2 “Their quasi-Turanian theology (or rather theosophy and theogony) required temples almost as grand as those of the Copts and Tamuls;” yet not till the very close of the 7th century B.C. were any worthy Aryan shrines reared within Grecian limits or Western Asia; nor in India till about the 6th century B.C., or the rise of Budhism. There were indeed prosperous cities and necessarily shrines in the days of Aryan Ráma and other stirring periods of the epic poems; and the early Budhists mention shrines and palaces, but they must have been rude and, except as caves, ephemeral; for not until about the Christian era were there any really enduring shrines—as stupas with temples, and this must have been some 3000 years after the Aryan began to displace the old Turano-Kusian rulers. That the invaders were then rude nomads, we shall show more fully hereafter, from such passages as those wherein they describe the “cities and towers” of the Turanians as “built of stone firm as iron, lofty and impregnable.” 1 Introduc., I. 57-62. 2 Hist. of Architecture, I. 70-74."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c. Eastern Aborigines. 468Even in America, says Mr. Fergusson, Turanian art “sprang up with as much perfection we may assume, as it would have attained, had they (the Turanians) been prnctised for thousands of years.” Nay, he is “startled to find” that the arts of those “who inhahited the South of France, on the skirts of the Glacial period, are identical with those of the Eskimo of the present day, and even at that early period, they had attained a degree of perfection which could hardly be surpassed by any people in the same condition of life at the present day.” This learned author even ennnciates broadly, and as a general rule, which all his studies in art and architecture have confirmed as correct, that “as Aryan influence prevailed, art first languished and then died” (p. 73); but not in these matters only has the so bepraised “noble Aryan” been far behind his great predecessors. If our pages 150 onwards have been carefully studied, it will be seen that many authors to whom we are deeply indebted for our advance in a knowledge of the mythologies, religions and languages of pre-historik times, have—as is natural to all bold pioneers—here somewhat misled us; yet it is due to their aid that we can pick our way pretty securely through fields we dared not have adventured without this. Everywhere we have chafed under the hard and fast tutelage of those philologists, who have urged us to seek only for the roots of all mythologies and faiths, and for the radixes of all sacred names of gods, heroes and rites, in the comparatively modern period of nationalized languages, instead of in the Rhematik and Nomadik grammar stages, before even the very first rude Dialect Era had begun to develope into what was in the far future to be Aryan, Shemitik, and typical Turanian Nationalized tongues. The MYTHOPŒIK or myth-making stage, say some philologists, belongs to the end of the dialect-forming period; when dialects had differentiated so thoroughly as to begin to form national tongues, like the Aryan Sanskrit, Zend, Greek and Latin; the Shemitik, Arabik, Asyrian and Hebrew, and the Turanian, Turkish, Chinese and Drâvidian groups. Were this indeed the first mythopœik period, our task in unravel-ling all myths by philology would be comparatively simple, but it is not so; and instead, we have to search far back in the dark “Rhematik and Nomadik stage of grammar,” when the first Aithiops flourished, and when wild, rude peoples in the state of certain of our present African, Australian and Polynesian savages, started the myths which the great but unacknowledged Turanian peoples we have been consider-ing matured and handed down. This they did to races of then inferior civilization, but who eventually sprang into great Aryan or Shemitik nationalities, and surpassed their masters. This difficulty of the so-called “mythopœik age,” has presented itself to many philologists who have tried to unravel myths through nationalized tongues; for Professor Max Müller explains that he does not mean that myths did not exist before, mythology, (Chips II. 147).

So then, the popularly thought-to-be Aryan myths were common everywhere before Aryan tongues, and therefore before Aryans existed, or Sanskrit was Sanskrit;1 and this being so, we have to try and thread our way back for the roots of ideas and all existing etymons of words or names and symbols of to-day, to the time when man was not only nomadik, but the very elements of his speech were. To do this by analyzing ancient and modern words of the National period of language, is no doubt one of the most im-portant modes of guessing at the real old significations, which if found true to ancient man’s untaught and rudest stages of thought we may for the present so far accept; but it has been our prescribed task throughout these volumes to go beyond this, and by prob-ing deeply into the esoterik ideas and veiled symbols of all existing old faiths of a like nature with the most ancient, to explain and harmonize the past by the present, aided by all those neverchanging feelings and desires inherent in our uncultivated animal nature. We thus tread upon ground if more treacherous, yet as imperishable as language, because constantly fed and renewed by the very constitution of our nature, and by symbolisms which the historic and pre-historic eras alike show to be universal and undying—conyentional and forgotten, though they be amongst the illiterate. To refer the explanation of mythologies and old sacred names to the comparatively cultured days when Vedas were chanted and Vedantism founded, or to Asyrians, Hebrews, Budhists and their Játaka writers, is doubtless to speak of carts, and to infer that therefore there were horses, and this is something, but not enough. The Vedas and other early Aryan writings, are the lucubrations of a literary class at a comparatively modern post-mythopœik age, when men had concentrated themselves into great nationalities with established laws, politics, religions, rites and customs, and had cultivated poetry and the arts, and developed social and family life. But between this period and the real first mythopœik stage there is, it is confessed by the philologist, “a great gulf fixed,” which neither he nor any philosophers have yet bridged.2 Myth-making is the ordinary condition of thought in the wild or childish states, and only fails to commend itself to our minds and memories as we become civilized and intellectual; and hence the unravelling of myths by the learned, and partial reforming by the illiterate, which we see in the history of national languages like Sanskrit and Greek. The savage or rude man, naturally personated all the unknown phenomena with which he found himself surrounded; and made the greatest and most marvellous of these his gods, and of course “male and female like unto himself,” as did the early Sethites. He saw all animal nature absorbed like himself in production and reproduction, and so he imagined were the planets above, and the mountains, 1 Cf. Mr. A.

But we must not detain our readers longer here on. these philological matters, though we would ask them to carefully bear the following in mind in regard to all our etymological and mythological researches. 1st comes THE RHEMATIK PERIOD OF LANGUAGES. when words and expressions were first coined for the most necessary ideas—when the mere germs of all languages existed, but uncombined, and when MYTHS WERE FORMED. 2nd comes THE NOMADIK STAGE OF GRAMMAR, the great mythopœik or myth-framing period, when mankind segregated into wandering tribes and families, and when myths diverged and increased. 3rd comes THE DIALECTIC PERIOD when tribes were forming into communities, and their languages were differentiating into dialects and then into typical Turanian, Shemitik, and Aryan groups, but before sharply defined tongues had formed. Hence the terms used in the mythologies or faiths of the next or NATIONAL Period of Language, had not yet become fixed or formulated, as we can observe this in the 4th stage. 4th STAGE—THE NATIONAL PERIOD OF LANGUAGE. Tongues now become grouped into well-defined Shemitik and Aryan classes, and distinct Turanian types. Mythologies become more or less fixed and formulated according to national circumstances—climatik and geological, and National ideosyncrasies developed. A literature now arose, but only after learning had for a long period been carried down from parent to child in the minds and memories of the races. Much crystallization of the old ideas and names thus arose, together with more or less unconsious punning upon these, which misled investigators and confused faiths and mythologies. We rejoice to sce that the too straitened rules of orthodox philology are now felt to be intolerable even by their framers, when they are engaged in original investi-gations regarding very ancient histories and faiths. Ever and again the bands are unloosed or explained away, as by the priest when anxious to rid himaelf of the untenable dogma of a universal flood or the creation of all things in six days. We have noticed that Eden has been lately swept away by a learned Roman Catholic, and relegated to the limbo of Hindu and other mythical Merus on to, or beyond the Pamir or World’s roof.1 But this theory of M. Lenormant dissolves all our orthodox geography into the thinnest, and by the bye, coldest of air; and gives a most unlikely habitat for such warm sun-gods as Adonai, Jahveh or Jah, El-Shadai or any El-ohim, and all our semi-tropical patriarchs. It sadly confuses our per-ception as to Ararat, and the “righteous Lot’s cities of the plain,” &c., but we must leave these points to the churches; we are here concerned only with the difficulties which the philologist experiences in such researches, turning as these must do, on the investigation of the fundamental bases and meanings of very ancient pre-historik names. “It is characteristic,” says our Egyptologist and Asyriologue, “of these few 1 See Contemp. Rev., ending Sept. 1881."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Early Merus or Edens of Turano-Meru-Opes and Aryans. 471names belonging to the quite primitive geography of the traditions common to Aryans, Shemites, and even other races—names, the origin of which go back to a date far earlier than that at which the two families of Indo-European and Syro-Arabic languages became such as we now study them, and the real etymology of which it would be impossible at the present day to restore—it is the characteristic of these names to reappear both among Aryans and Shemites, under forms sufficiently similar for comparison to be made with every appearance of probability, although these forms have been combined in such a manner as to have a meaning in the languages of both.” This is said with reference to the difficulties experienced in tracing the Meru-opes, or Aithi-opes, and various Merus, as the Paradisiacal garden of Udyana in Kashmér and its four rivers—a parallel to the Gan-Eren of Sethites —and according to M. Renan such old names as Meriah, Moriyâh &c. M. Lenormant, seeing the connection here between the Shemitik and Aryan myths, is compelled “to recognise such as belonging to the legendary nomenclature of primitive ages,” the special nature of which he has defined by saying, that “they may be found among people belonging to widely different races, with a significant form in the language of each of these peoples; because all the forms in question, which from a strictly philological point of view are radically irreconcilable, in reality constitute only more or less ingenious combinations intended to give a meaning to traditional appellations, the real origin and significance of which had long been forgotten.” He adds that “a systematic labour of false etymology has given to those names of pre-historic geography, preserved by a stupendously ancient tradition, the appearance of names of Aryan formation among the Aryans, Shemitik among the Shemites, and so on.” The italics are ours, and the argument is one we have frequently urged and will more fully develop hereafter. We only object to “the systematic false etymology” in regard to nouns and very old names of gods, heroes sacred places or deified phenomena, and in some cases, of rites and customs which go back “to stupendously ancient traditions,” not of course attempting to apply such ruling to ordinary words such as verbs and their formations. The coincidences of these, running in the same grooves as to sound, meaning, and in application more or less to the same rites, obser-vances, and phenomena, we of course point out, but will leave specialists to account for. Bearing all this in mind let us now resume our researches as to these old Mer-opes, Aithiopes, Kuths or Kushites, Akads and Kheti. In the Homerik recitations of some 900 years B.C., we are told that “these were found at once towards the rising and setting sun;” whilst Canon assured us that to King Keph-eus (the lord of Kefts or Caphtorim, whose seaport was Iop, our Jopa) most of Westem Asia belonged, and that “he ruled far away over the Arabians dwelling on the Eruthrean seas.” On the coasts, his subjects were Phoiniks but inland they were Kuthim, a name by which Judeans still, or till very lately, called their Samaritan brethren. We do not require to be reminded by Arrian that Kutha or Kolchi, evidently lived in Southern "},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

We will presently speak of their wondrous buildings, and architectural and engineering capacities, such as no other Indo race, least of all early Aryans, evinced. We have ourselves gazed with astonishment in days when the subject was strange to us, at the “Druid circles,” Dolmens, Kromlechs and Kistvaens, &c., which some thirty-five years ago we noticed all over southern, and central India; and used to wonder what had brought our Druid countrymen into those far way lands of a torrid zone. he remains have grievously suffered since those days, but still we find observers writing as follow.1 “Circles of stones of all sizes . . . surround-ing buried or half buried Kistvaens are met with in great abundance around Sâva-durga, 22 miles west of Bangalore. . . . The cap stones of some are 13 feet long by 10 broad, and one with projecting flanges represents almost accurately the form of the well-known Svastika,” see our figures and pages 444-447. The same writer says of the old megalithik monuments of North Arcot, that in size, shape and arrangement they are extraordinary. The central cell or Kistvaen is usually enclosed by three concentric circles of upright stones, each having its top rudely worked into a semi-circular or rectangular shape, or a conical or obeliskal form, which in a land abounding with Lingams, shows that the idea was clearly an ark and its phali. “A score or more of these are still standing,” writes Col. Branfill in 1880; whilst amidst the antiquities of Mamandur in South Arcot, are rock-cut chambers and inscriptions with Dolmen of gigantic peculiar construction, regarding the origin of which nothing whatever is known. We have seen many similar remains, and for these and other reasons elsewhere given, we conclude that the offspring of Khete or Kusis were the establishers of Drâvido-Indian civilization, who initiated that love of art and commerce, which has always characterized these rock sculpturers and temple builders. Mr. Cust, a distinguished Indian statesman,2 says “these pre-Arian races have left in India (not only) the rnins of remarkable buildings but attached undying names to rivers and mountains, . . . that Drávidians were one of these races whom Arians could neither exterminate nor absorb.” Indeed Indo-Arians dare not have attempted this, and we have no record that they ever did so until a few centuries B.C., and then only to the extent of driving back the far northern bounds of Telugu Drávida, bordering on Orissa and Bundelkhand. Even Aryan Ráma only entered into compacts with some of the lower dark wild tribes, when making a hasty raid on Ceylon some 1200 B.C. About that time the Aryan was no longer a “low born” or nomad, but “a nobleman” and a conqueror, and he had in turn learned to call the darker races of the north his inferiors, 1 Lt. Col.

Drâvidians ruled India from the confines of Orissa to Northern Ceylon and Cape Kumāri, or over 10° of latitude, and says Mr Cust, “the province of Goa in the West . . . . with large tracts in the Vindhya range and beyond, and even parts of the banks of the Ganges at Rajmahâl. . . . . There are traces of their language found in the Brahui, spoken by a tribe in Baluchistan, and there are affinities between this family and that form of speech which has survived to our times in the second or proto-median tablet of Behistun.”2 The Khonds of the Eastern Vindhyas, Gonds of the Centra1 Indian plateau, and the Oraons of Rajmuhâli are still Drâvidian fragments which intrude upon othenvise Aryan India; but without taking these into account, the South Drâvidian nations number some 45 millions of people, viz:— Tamils, . . . . . 16 millions Kanarese, . . . . 10 millions Tri-lingas or Telugus, . 15 ,, Malayālams, . . . . 3 ,, and about one millioms of other tribes. Of this great mass of peoples, the Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, Monier Willams, seems scarcely able to pen a sufficient panegyric.3 They are termed races of great ability, whose history goes far back into pre-historic times. He finds they exhibit an extraordinary aptitude, patience, endurance, and skill in any work however irksome and severe; and are worthy to be called “the Europeans of the East,” or as we would say, the Aithiopes or Phenicians of the East. Like Europeans, says the Professor, they are also liable to yield with like energy to vices, though never equal in this respect to the Christian, when he is low and unprincipled. They are described as faithful, honest, and devoted workmen and servants, and with great filial dutifulness and affection. They are never ashamed of their relations, however poor these may be, nor of their religion, which is interwoven with every affair of their daily life; and are temperate in eating and drinking, and altogether more trustworthy than Christians. From these races also have sprung many and good religious revivalists, of whom in historic times are Sankarâ-āchārya, the Sivaite of the 7th century, and Rāmānuja and Madhava, th. Vishnavas of respectively the 12th and 14th centuries of our era. “In many respects,” continues the Professor, “Drâvidians are the counterparts of the Zoroas-trian Iranians who descended upon Persia and India in the 8th century B.C. as Magians and Fire worshippers; and precisely as the Iranians adjusted their differences, and settled down together with Magians, so did Aryans with these rulers of Southern India.” In both cases there was an intimate social and religious blending; and in the greater Puranik 1 See our origin of Aryan names under Indexes, and especially Vol. II., p. 150 and onwards. 2 Cust, p. 296. 3 Modern India, p. 128 and elsewhere, and XIX.

Eastern Aborigines. 474development of the southern faith over the Vedantism of the north, we see how the strong and conservative character of the sturdy Drâvid resisted the Aryan, and recon-structed the Vedik faith on Drâvidian lines. Mr. Nelson, an able writer on Indian law, shows that not only did no considerable body of Aryans ever pierce Drâvidian India, but that no Aryan laws or institutions were ever powerful there; and certainly not those of the Manavas or laws of the Manu Sāstra until forced upon the South through the mistaken zeal of Sir William Jones, a student of Northern Aryan law.1 Drâvidians had their own distinct Turano-Drâvidian tongue until about our 6th century, as well as a very extensive literature, into which there began to flow an admixture of Aryan and Shemitik words, which was very much due to their extensive foreign and coasting trade. Of course they had also added or incorporated into their language, the names and terms for mountains, rivers, seasons, rites, &c. &c., which came to them from the dark races they had displaced ages before Aryans were heard of: and we may concede that Pali, proto-Pali and cognate tongues, were introduced by them or their northern kinsmen of Kusi or Kushite races; the more so as philologists are now contending, that the languages of the Pali groups resemble in many respects the tongues of ancient Phoinikes, Syrians, Yemens, &c. Tamil and Telugu are copious and difficult languages, as we well know after studying and talking them for many years. The former is highly accentuated and very complex in its affixes and combinations, and if archaic in tone, certainly not pleasant as talked by the illiterate. Telugu is a much easier and simpler tongue, and far more liquid and melodious than ltalian, though called “the Italian of the East.” It is also a very fully developed language, and obtains from Madras to the Bengal frontier and over a large part of Central India; defining, and here is its interest to us, a very ancient and persistent race of Linga worshippers. But we must first ask our readers’ attention to the energy and skill in design and execution, of Drâvidians as builders. Many books describe and pourtray their works. Professor Monier Williams, who only saw a few of their principal buildings in his rapid tours through India, was so struck with their temples, that he writes: “these are as superior to those of Benares, as Westminster Abbey and St. Pauls are to those of London.”2 We who have however, minutely examined most of the famous shrines of India can add, that there is nothing to equal those of Drâvidis, save some small ones in Western India, which in their completeness, form and conception, denote the same master-builders who, as Jainas, &c., learned in Mysore and the South, under those great architects. The very name of Drâvidas, has come to signify “strength and wealth,” though Aryans now claim them as descendants of their Kshatryas or warrior-class, admitting they are “Brahmanical Drâviras,” as distinguished from Gour and other northern Brahmans. 1 Art. by J.H.

The Telugus worship three special Lingas, but often five and even seven, where incarnations or apparitions of their Siva have appeared, nor altogether disappeared. Siva is indeed “The Tri-Linga God,” possibly because the Trinity or idea of “three” denotes “perfection” or because he signifies the three male organs, but he is also the “Pancha Linga,” or God of the “Five Lingas,” Essences or Powers—thereby denoting that the Creator is greater than the created. His five special Lingas are—1 1. The Prithivi Linga, or that of “Earth,” (reminding us of the red earthy Ādama), at Conjeveram, near Madras, once the capital of Drâvida. 2. The Ab-Linga, or that from which water exudes, at Jambuk-Esvāram, in Sri-rangam, Trichinopoli. 3. The Tejo-Linga, or that which sparkles with light, fire or energy, at Tiruna Mălē. 4. The Vayu-Linga, or that which vibrates or pulsates as wind, and whose fire or lamp is ever vibrating, at Kala-stri or Sri-Kalahasti in the N. Arcot District. 5. The Akasa Linga or aerial and invisible one, which must be worshipped with-out the devotee seeing any material form, at Chidambram in S. Arcot District. The Mahâ Deva is also worshipped in a dual or quintuple form, as the Sri-Pancha-Linga, or “Self-Existent One,” and “Lord of the Daughter of the Mountains,” or of Pârvati, “Child of Himâlaya,” his divine Sakti; indeed we suspect the term Akasa Linga, is a veiled reduplication of Linga, as the “Ling of Lingas.” The word Achāra, though now in Sanskrit “a rule of conduct,” was not so in the very old Purânas which went back to Vedik times. There we are told that in this Andhra land (the name Sanskritists gave to Tel-lingāna), the people were given up to “for-bidden practice,” or Akara, and that Achāryas were leaders of impure and mysterious rites.2 Aka was the eponym name of the early Akadian and Egyptian solar deity, and the Akras a tribe of African Sun worshippers, and Achâra is an actual name for Siva, whose Ark or Akra was the centre of all Akro-poIi Vedik Sutras mention Purânas of some 1500 B.C. which were known to Apastamba and his confreres. These seem to have been unacquainted with Pânini, yet knew all about Vedas, Vedantists and Andhrajâtias, who, says Buhler, flourished “a considerable time before the Vedik period came to an end.” Aryans obtained a footing in northern Andhra, he thinks, “long before the end of the 4th century B.C.,” but “a dynasty of Andhras,” says Wilson, “reigned in Magadha down to about 18 B.C.,” and the 1 Burgess’ Arch.

When the Ghazni Mahamadans first appeared on the Western Indian frontiers, they found a profusion of Linga temples, and enriched themselves by despoiling these, as that of Soma-Nāth, where Siva stands like the Egyptian Apis, the bearer of the crescent, see fig. 10 of our Plate X. p. 168. Sanskritists called Telugus Andhra-jātias, after one of their celebrated kings. As Andrus, they ruled in Magadha and over all the valleys of Kal-linga—the early name the Andræ gave to the Jamuna or Jamna, and their name Gentu is a corruption running through Andu, Entu and Antu.2 As the Aryans increased in Upper India, the Tri-lingas seem gradually to have worked south and coastways; but they long held their celebrated hill fortress of Kal-linga or Kalinjar, to watch over all movements adverse to Drâvidas in the valley of the Kal-linga, and its southern water-sheds. On going south they seem to have then established two capitals, a coast one which they also called Kal-linga, near Andhra (our Chikakol), which ruled over all their Khond tribes and Orissa, and “possibly extended to the Ganges Valley;”3 and the other towards Central India at Warangul, on the south bank of the Godavery, from which to govern all their Gond and Central Indian hill tribes. They had finally to yield up Kal-linger, for no Gangetic Aryan kingdom could feel safe so long as that large and strong fortress belonged to Andhras. Indeed, we remember the day when our Supreme Government long and anxiously weighed the question, if it were prudent to withdmw its soldiers from that high sacred hill, owing to the strong native feeling, that “he only who held Kalinjar, ruled Centrol and Dravidian India.” The Northern Tri-lingas usually name as their three favourite Lingas, and they are probably their oldest, that at Andhra, Kal-linga and Amra-Ishwāra, which after-wards became the thrice-holy Budhist shrine of Amrâvati, long known to Arabs as Rahmi. But enough here of this branch of Indo Kuths or Kusis. They probably never knew anything of their equally far travelled western kin, some of whom we think, passed west by the Indus and Eruthrean seas, whilst others from high Asia went direct through Baktria and the Kaukuses—so long their Colchian home. The Southern Tamils and Ceylonese Drāvids also persistently threw off colonies, as the Ka-Kuses of Siam, Indo-Sumatrians, Javanese, and Little Javanese or Bāliys, like to the Indo-Bâlis of Ceylon, whom we know so well to this day as Serpent and Spirit worshippers, only to be in this equalled by the old Akads and Kuths of 1 Imp.

Lenor-mant’s Chaldean Magic read in connection with Upham’s Budhism. It is to these great temple builders that Siam, Kambodia, Java, &c., owe such wondrous phalo-ophite shrines as Nakom, Bodo Bodur, and others evidently still lying hid in pathless forests and prairies. Let us look at the India Bâlis, for here is the origin of Baal worship. Bal, Bel, Baal, Balhi, Bali. and Val, Vel, Fal, Fala, &c., are all most important Kushian, Akadian Phoinikian, but in the first place, Eastern terms, which their Asiatik ancestors carried to their western homes. As divine names they are resolvable into B’, Ba, and Al, El, or Ili, as in Bab-Il of Babylon, &c.; and in Egpyt they gradually took, as Upham shows, such forms as the phalik Set, Seth or sutekh, the God of those given to Onolatria.1 Akads called Bab-Ilu, Ka-Ding-Ira, the God Ira—the Iru of the Bâlis of Ceylon, and their Sun-God, to whom Sun-day was sacred; and Ira, is Ila or Elo, the Creator of Genesis, on whom Christ is said to have called at death. It is pro- bable that the Akadian words are here Ka, Dio-Ila, in which Ka is the strong male affix, and Ding = De or Deus, for Asyrians considered he was Deus exsuperantissimus. With Egyptians Ba was the souh and Ba-ah the phalus and testes—the hieroglyph for Osiris. Throughout India Ba is an affix of strength, and Bhā is Light or the Sun, and Bhaga is Siva, and if feminine, Venus. Thus Ba-al Pe-Or or B’al P’UR, rwop lob is “the strong or fruitful Pi Or,” or Sun Oracle, a form of “the burn- ing or eager one” in Ham-On. So Bâal-Tzedik is Jove, the High or phalik Al or El, and this alao agrees with Indian terms like Bâla-Rama or Herakles, and Mahā-Bhal-esvar the Siva of nncient Bhilas, which Mr Hall tells us used to be transcribed Bhayl-esan, from its celebrated temple sacred to Bhaila the Sun.2 He notices that in Central India Bhaila (or Bâli) worship “existed in the middle ages,” and it is more than probable that the intense Serpent, Tree and Sun worship which the Bhilsa ruins exhibit, and which are ascribed to the first three centuries B.C., were the work of Bâlis, then becoming somewhat Aryanized. The earliest Budhists would certainly be free from a faith and objects so repugnant to their pious Master. There is, as Mr. Thomas here notices, a striking likeness between the Sun symbolism. of all the early so-called Budhist Topes and those of Kaldia. He quotes approvingly Mr Hislop’s observation upon the Skuthik origin of Gonds and Kurs, and their solar horse-idea, from which probably came theAryan Asvins—“the Horses or Pervaders,” and the Asva-meda or Horse sacrifice, which is thought to have been the first attempted substitution for the Purusha meda or Man sacrifice. Bâla-Rāma (Herakles) was the Akadian Mulge or Mahā-E1-ge or Great El, whom Asyrians called B’El—the Bha-il of Bhiles, and the deity of all that immense inter-vening country, Bâlu-istan or Baluchistan, or land of Bâlus or Bâlis. Thus all India, Baktria, Karmania and Gedrosia was devoted to Bal worship. According to the Mahâbhârata, Balk was called Balhi, and early Baktrians, Balis, and according to 1 [Neologism for “worship of asses.” — T.S.] 2 Hall’s Visnnu Purana, II. 150, as quoted by Mr. E.

Bâli, they acknowledged, was not only the Emperor of all India. but “by his religious devotions and austerities had acquired the dominion of the three worlds,” meaning all the known world. He is called the Son of Drisana or Virochana, the Son of Prahlâda, or one of the Prahlâdas of the Satya Yuga or “first Age of Righteousness,” in which was no labour or sorrow, priests or sacrifices, “but one God and one Veda”—the dream of many pietists. Bâli was the first monarch of the next or Tretā Yuga, when honest labour began, and men still adhered to truth and loved righteousness and fair dealing, but sought a reward for their labor, and learned to sacrifice to the gods.1 It was therefore such an age as merchant princes of Aithiopik stock would be likely to inaugurate, but with riches came sacrifices, rituals, priest-craft, and their attendant evils. Aryans represented by Vishnu had long been striving for the mastery, and the Vedik gods, then weakly and overruled by their strong and skilful rulers—the trading and building Baal or Bel worshipping Kushis —now urged Vishnu to make another effort. Force and fair fighting could not prevail, so the Aryan divine chief, knowing Balis’ piety and generosity, determined to impose upon these, and to exact a promise from the Ruler, which he knew if given would be fullilled at all hazards. He accordingly assumed the habit of a poor travelling mendicant, Vāmana or dwarf, and presenting himself before the great Emperor, besought his charity and as much land as he could cover in three strides. His petition was granted, and this scene forms the 5th Avatār of Hindu-ism here given in fig. 310, where the King sits on his phalange or Ark, a diademed or solar monarch, with the sacred Poita or “Zenar thread” reaching orthodoxly, for reasons already given, to the genitals.2 The dress and details of the 1 Prof. Dowson and Garrett’s Clas.

The Aryan beggar has a Tartar-like fur cloak hanging from his neck, exposing a well-dressed person, with the sacred + on his breast—another Turanian emblem nearly as common in ancient Kaldia as in Egypt. As soon as the deceitful Aryan had got his lord’s promise, he assumed his giant form, and strode over all the earth and heavens, and finally placed his foot on the good king’s head. Nevertheless the monarch—fit representative of an age of truth, and of the great traders of antiquity—adhered to his word, and, says Aryan story, he who had in fair fight vanquished all Aryan gods and peoples, now acknowledged Vishnu and was translated to heaven as Lord of Hades, or Patāla, and has ever since been worshipped by the old races and Balis as a constellation. Owing to his great power and the universality of Bâl worship, he and his immediate descendants are said to have a thousand arms. Now this is an important glimpse into the meaning of the Avatāras of Hinduism, and doubly so as obtained through an investigation of reliable religious history. It opens up the whole raison d’être of these, and we will here therefore glance back for a moment on the previous Incarnations. This last Bali king was, though the first of the second or Tretā age, the last of the great dynasty of Asuras, Dānavas, Daityas or Titans (as these Non-Aryans were variously called), who had ruled the Eastern world from its creation, or all through the first Satya or Kretā—“Age of Righteousness, Peace and Plenty,” or for 4000 Divine years, each of which, said the Aryan book of Genesis, was equal to 360 of the years of man.1 Even according to the records of their Aryan traducers, this was the world’s “Golden Age,” and these its best or “Golden Monarchs,” which is signified in their dynaatik appellation of Hiranya “the Golden.” The greatest of these was Balis’ ancestor Hiranya Kasipu, which last, though now translated variously, did we opine, either denote his race through Kasi or Kusia, or else his faith in the previous or first Avatāra; the Kurma or Kasyapa or Turtle, by which the world was created, and on which it was then said to rest. The faith of the great Daityas, was the same as that of the Titani and Typhoni of the West. All were solo-phalik of only a lower or more gross form than the Baali Elohi, or early Baeli of East and West. Hiranya Kasipu was “the Son of the Sun,” or of Kasyapa and Diti, and even according to early Aryan scriptures, higher than Indra, having “power over the sun and moon, the earth and the waters and fire and air.” “Nought could withstand him,” said Vedik and sub-Vedik writers, “for all power was given to him by Rudra” (Siva), showing that his Baal-ism was Linga-ism and pre-existed all Aryan faiths, nay, was the foundations on which they built Indra-ism and Vishnuism. Hiranya-Kasipu “held the sovereignty” of not only “all the three worlds, but of all the immortals, for a hundred million 1 Prof. Dowson and Garrett’s Clas.

In vain did Vishnu try to convert or move this great king. Failing him, he attacked an outpost as it were of the faith, in his twin brother Hiranya-Aksha, “the Golden-eyed One,” who in Aryan opinion “had dragged the earth (or their country) down to the bottom of the sea,” just as our legislators sometimes exclaim when on the “opposition benches.” Under these circumstances, Vishnu, for certain mythological reasons, went down to the lowest depths in the form of a boar—his 3rd, or VARÁHA Avatāra—and rais up his country, and then “fought the Daitya for above 1000 years;” all of which is delineated and explained on p. 221 of our first volume, and elsewhere, though the de-crystalation of the Avatāras has not been attempted. The war was of course one of faiths, rituals and practices more or less militant, as these usually are, and the great Titan was eventually slain; but with only the poor satisfaction of making a slight impression upon a feeble-minded nephew, Prahlâda, who then took to worshipping Vishnu as a god, and thus called down upon him-self the wrath and ridicule of his father, King Hiranya Kasipu. The old Bâali monarch tried to reason with his son as to the absurdity of attributing to his deity omniscience and omnipotence; and “smit-ing violently” one of the stone pillars of his palace, probably too violently, asked if Vishnu was there; when it broke asunder and the king was killed, but the Aryan chronicler says, “out started the god as a half man half lion and tore the aged monarch to pieces.” This is usually depicted thus as the Nâra-sinha or 4th Avatār of Vishnu. It too was in no sense satisfactory, for Prahlâda returned to his father’s faith, and pro-duced similar Prahlâda kings, down to the close of the Golden Age, when arose the great and good Bâly of the 5th Avatār, whose end though favourable at last to Aryan rule is another moral blot on the Aryan escutcheon.

Here are a few of the ordinary ideographs which educated Balis call planetary, but which all ordinary Ceylonese worship when these are set up before them at fêtes, and for the mitigation of evils. These emblems originally simply meant the energies of fertilization, as they indeed rather too coarsely pourtray, but we must give them as Mr. Upham found them.1 Fig. 312—BRAS-PATI OR SOLAR JAH Fig 313—DEVI RUPI, A CONSORT.

Fig. 317—RAHU, FERTILITY, THE FISHY SERPENT In Sankrit a Balin or Bala-in signifies a bull or boar as a typical Fertilizer, showing where Aryans got that idea. In Aryan Rāma’s day the Royal Bali had descended from being emperor of Upper India to be only the chief of the monkeys or dark aborigines. The solarist fought with the Bâli and, say the Aryan writers, conquered him, but mercifully reinstalled him as King of Kish-kindya—a mode pro-bably of explaining that Bâlis and Bâlism, could not be conquered or eradicated, and that the latter had become the faith of the non-Aryan hill and iland tribes. But if Balis found enemies in Vedantiam or early Brahmanism, much more did they in Budha and his immediate followers. Upham shows in his tenth chapter that these made the most determined effort to drive out such rude nature worshippers, and did so to a great extent; for after the rise of Budhism we find Bâlis flying seawards to Java, “Little Java” or Bâly, and all the Sunda group; and there they are still, with their marked Dravidian characteristics. In the new Encyclo. Brit. we find the 800,000 inhabitants of the ilet of Baly thus described. They are energetic traders, skilled, busy and enterprising. whether as masters, workmen or servants. “They are recog-nisable by a higher cast of spirit, independence and manliness, than belong to any of their neighbours . . . . . are good agriculturalists and skilful artizans, especially in textile fabrics and the manufucture of arms. . . . . .

But though in Java, Hindnism may have been extinct for some four centuries, not so in Baly and the adjacent iland of Lombok. There the system of caste and rite of widow-burning still obtains, inter-mingled with a corrupt Budhism overgrown with a belief and worship of Kala-s, that is Bâlis or Spirits, to whom offerings are made conjointly with sacrifices to Hindu Devas, to induce these to mediate between men and the Bali divinities. Here, then we have a Western artizan race who still manufacture weapons for gods and men, and who may well be the children of Hephaistos, the Kuklopian master-builders, the clever old Daktuloi and the mystik-loving, fire and serpent worshipping Kabiri, equally devoted to magic and spirits, and all things planetary. And says Lassen, “these islands were peopled by Indians before the middle of our 1st century” (Ency. Brit.); aye and probably 1000 years before that, and they have had from the earliest times a Balinese sacred literature written in the Kawi or ancient Javanese language. Budha became with such races only a good and learned Saviour, sorcerer or Bali, who cast out devils, and was the instructor of their Mars, the Sword or Javelin God Kandi-kundra,1 and the teaeher and in some respects the servant of Samana, the Siva of the phalik cone of sacred Lănka. So Gnostiks said2 Christ was “a good Saviour” and the caster forth of demons, and they too allied him with planets, fish, serpents and all things solo-phalik; and in like manner it was said of him that he acted through Bâ-alzebub or Bale-zebab, a fallen God, but who like Baal or Balleros was no demon when Ahaziah King of Israel sought his aid in preference to Yahuê.3 In like manner Balis said that Budha acted “by virtue of a sacred stone,” chest, box, cippus or ark, “his Minny Phalange or power,” which was also equivalent to their local Meru or Mienmo, the cone of Saman and an “emblem of Almighty energy.” Thus the Eduth or Testimony, its Ark and the Sina, Sun or Săm-God, were all identical; and so too “the Tree of Life,” the Phalus and the Serpent, for these too were set up on the cippus for worship, and the whole was then one god, as we see in these Budhist coins and various sculptures as given in General Cunningham’s Bhilsa Topes. Here is the early Bodhistik idea of Bodhas and Budhas. This learned archeologist in his observations on “the teaching class of Indian Behat coins” which exhibit a T on a cippus or square box, calls this “an emblem of the Sun,” which Mr. E. Thomas thinks is confirmed from other cir-cumstances, but he prefers to see in the T, “an early conventional type of 1 Corresponds to the Curê or Quries of ancient Skyths, the sacred swords of Japan and Arabia, and the early Bod or Bud of India and Ireland. 2 Cf.

Indeed the Ceylon Palol tree is called, says Upham, “the Kiri-Nâga or serpent,” and stands as he shows in his 5th Plate, precisely as the old solo-phalik God Sakria, Sekre or Chakra did, sometimes on and at other times in the Phalange or Cippus, and as Budha did in later days; for even this modest ascetik was constantly shown as here superseding the phalik Sakria! and also Visva-karma, the honored Vulcan of this great artificer race. Their Chakra was “the fiery wheel of the heavens,” sometimes a simple circle—the Surya-Mandala, his earliest Akado-Kushite type—at other times a spoked wheel with centre boss or seeds, and a perimeter of fiery radii or Apolonik darts, or as in Egypt with open fiery hands, vide our fig. 79, p. 200, Vol. I., where he is seen dropping them down upon his worshippers and on his holy ark of fire—“the square box” of Isis. Christians exhibit the same Isinian idea in this coarse Venetian picture, where the solar god is seen impregnating the typical virgin of the faith with his rays, and here too is the ark-like cippus as an altar, before which the woman prays for offspring.2 for the altar is the Ark of Life or “of the Testimony,” or as the Bâlis called it, the sacred Minny Phalange, in which were all “the mysteries” of the faith and the promise of the life to come. In fig. 320 is another set of Budhist emblems from Cunningham’s Topes of Bhâlesvâr, to show that Bodhism or Budism was Bâlism and not peculiar to Ceylonese Budhism, but was the ground upon which the literary faiths of India, nay of man, had to work, and which in consequence got welded into the new develop-ments and even into the pure and imageless religion of the sage of Gayâ. It is still fresh in the Sunda group.3 In this fig. 320 of next page we also see another form of the “Tree of Life” which developed with Eastern Bâalis and the Bel worshippers of Kaldia and Asyria, into a more ornate ideo-graph, as in our fig. 321 which has been explained at page 72 of our first volume. The Isinian or castelated “Ark of Fire,” is there approached by the Sacerdos or sacrificer of the Cult with his culter or knife and phalik cone, backed by the emblem of virility in the bull with serpent necklet; and so too in the Bhilsa tope coin, fig. 318, does a man advance to a castelated ark, carrying a fruit-bearing pole, thus assuring us that the Eastern and Western faiths were one. Note also that in fig. 320 the sun god, symbolized by the Sakria, Chakra or wheel, carries the Tri-sul or “three thorned” trident of Siva with Fleur de lis prongs (the male symbols), and that these are everywhere repeated 1 Indian Anty., May 1880.   2 See our Vol. I., p. 304. 3 Crawford’s His.

Siva similarly carries Soma or the moon on his head at Soma-Nâth, and a phalus carries Luna on the Asyrian Ark, see our fig. 219, ii. p. 87; and in Egypt, Osiris as Apis is seen doing the same in fig. 10 of our Plate X. p. 168. We see also the glans carried upon a pole in this Bhilsa fig. 320, v., just as it used to be in Asyrian altar subjects, vide figures given on pages 1 and 77 of this volume, and in this fig. 322, which has been explained at p. 206 of Vol. I. In many of these the sacred Tree is found, and seeing it interchanges with the cone and the gods Samana and Sakria, we are left in no doubt as to its being a mere phalik euphemism—a fact Prof. De Gubernatis’ Myth. des Plantes, makes abundantly clear. Samana is of course the Siva of the Hindu and Adām of the Moslem, represented by his throne, the great conical peak of central Lank; but we see him also in the Sama or Shamah, or upright Linga god of ancient Himyar, though as Sama-El, he fell like Mithras and Satan from heaven to Hades. The world is full of him under solar and honorable as well as very coarse ideas. Samana was Shams, Samas, Sama, Sana, San, Sen, Shem and Shemesh, from which came Semites or Shemites as we always spell this word. It is so pronounced in the East, and re-minds us better of the root and the patriarch Shem or Sham. All these words when affixed to names, as in their roots or derivatives Sar, Sur, Sir, Sire, Sor, Sal, &c., signified divine and kingly power, high birth, light and knowledge. M. Lenormant names them as the oldest Akadian and Altaik affixes, carrying also the old phalik explanations, as “he who increases, enlarges, expands, pushes,”1 in fact “Shams the server, fertilizer or quickener.” We have before dwelt long upon this “serving” feature of the Hebrew “Shiner or Shama” and the Asyrian Shami or “hot one”—the ithyphalik Ham, Cham, Kam or Khem of 1 Chaldean Magic, pp. 303-308."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Phalik Rise of Samana and Shamsh-ism.

Sama also means “the server” with Hindus, as in Sama-pati, “the Lord of copulaiton,” that is of Sama-pata. Siva as “the producer, pestle, iron pin of the yoke or the Linga,” is called Sam-bhu, Sam-ba, Sam-bhara, &c., and his sacred emblematic yoni shell as here given, is the Sam-bhuka or concha Veneris of the West, which is seen poised on the head of Sakria the Sun God, in Upham’s beautiful plates. The solar Herakles of Hebrews, Sm-Sun, was the reiter-ated Shemsh-On of great and divine power, but the S-m-s of Kaldis or Chusdians, became Nin-gal or Nir-gal, the Eagle headed Jove, who was “Judge of heaven and earth,” and whose wife-sister was Ish-tar or Sin the favorite of all Ion-im. M. Lenormant identifies the Sar, Sur or Ser gods with the Ashur rwca, or rca, or Siva of Asyria, whose shrine and capital was on the upper Tigris, the present Kālah Sher-gāt. He says that this was the North-West colony which the Akads early threw off, and that the phalik god’s name was made Ashur, Asur or Ua-sar by the addition of the Shemitik arrow—A or Au—to the Akadian root Sar.1 The same word represents a prominent early deity and sect in the Æsers of northern Finns and in the far east whence they and Akads came; and there too the god fell from heaven like Satan, the Devas or “Light Gods,” Aryaman, Ahura, Zeus, &c. Indeed the Asur or Asuras were gods or angels in high Asian or pre-Vedik and early Vedik days, but in all sub-Vedik literature, they are A-suras or “giant-demons,” the negative A being applied to the solar god Sura. Originally the word signified “the light beings,” from As “to be” and “the be-er,” “he who exists and makes to exist”—the phalik creator, and Ur or Ura light and fire; hence Ahura and Asura, with even a spiritual signification. Some early portions of the Vedas call Asura the “Living, breathing or Palpitating One;” and the Vedik supreme god is termed Asura Varuna, “The living God;” and even in the Ramâyana epos, the distinction between Asura and Sura is not very clear. Thus then, in point of fact, the name Aser, Eser, Ashar or Asur can be fairly derived from many sources according to the faith-meanings which various races at different periods attached to it. One affixed A as the male sign or plowshare, so that A-Sur was the ferrtilizing sun, another said he was As the holy or virile fire, and Ur or Ar (hence Al) the Light god, &c., &c. But the result was generally a phalik God of Fire, celestial and human; and it is no sufficient etymology which tells us that this most ancient word of Mongolian, Indian and Ugro-Finnik bases, signified in modern Asyrian something connected with water! All sky, solar and bull gods are only too clearly described as Vána or Vánas, the water and waterers. In Syria, Sham was interchangeable with Para, the Akad “God of Day,” or par; 1 Chaldean Magic, p. 334.

The ancient Sabas or Samas of Yemen called their king also after their god-ideas, as Sham-Ir, Sam-Er, or Sam-El. But let us now look at the other, and the oldest god of the Ceylonese Bâlis—Sekre, Sakri or Sakkraia, as Upham and others usually call him. It is clear Sekre was a supreme god long prior to Budhism, for he received the Sage at his birth in a golden bowl, which said the imitative Aryan, their Brahma also did; showing that the first or Hermetik Brahma, was a form of the Turamian Saka who had long been the high Asian god of all the Sakæ or Xacas, as Herodotos called the ancient Skuths. Saka was the “Sword God,” that is the primeval phalik Mars, the Curé or Quiris, and was worshipped as a javeline or scimitar stuck on the apex of a karn or heap of faggots. In fact we see him in our fig. 274. p. 357, and all the ordinary karns of old races; and we here give another emblem of him also from Huc,2 fig. 324, called “The Pyramid of Peace” or Karn-u-Salem or -Shalm, as usually erected by Tibeto-Budhist priests, when in fear of brigands, war, or famine, &c. It is a true Hermes formed of earth (Adame), plastered like the Jewish monoliths with lime, and has on the apex, where the Egyptian Hamite placed fire, a flag written over with prayers to the I or Pillar-god. Around it all kneel in silent or ejaculatory adoration, just as the Ceylon-ese Bâlis and others still kneel before Sakria’s cone, the Budh or Bod, or Adāme’s peak, whenever they see it. The Peak was their “Buda” ages before Sakya Muni was born, and a Karn-god or Bod continued to be the Siva of “Les Indes,” down to our 9th century, as we see from the Anciennes Relations3 of the two Arabian travellers who found girls being “devoted to Bod,” throughout Sourthern India, as they still are to Siva. So Tartary knew a Budha, Budh, Bout, or Bod, called Sakia Sinha or “the lion Sakia,” a thousand years before “Gotama the Budha” was born, and there were still three more Budha’s, all of course more Hermaik in character as they went back to the dark animal agees of the past. So the early Sakara was, said ancient Hindu scriptures, “a Bull,” “the disk of the sun,” and then the terrific diskus of the Sun-god—a “flaming sword which turned every way” against unbelievers, and now commonly known as 1 [This etymology of Pharaoh is spurious; see my note, p. 65. — T.S.] 2 Huc’s Travels, II. 92. 3 Translated from the Arabik by E.

Latterly Hinduism called Sagara “a Saviour of Indh,” “a good god and the son of King Baku,” a name familiar to Phoinikes and Greeks. Sagara was miraculously produced after a gestation of seven years in his mother’s womb, and on reaching manhood, he expelled all foreign and barbarous peoples from India. He established solo-fire worship, and various tribal distinctions, possibly the beginning of castes, and tried to reinstitute the horse sacrifice, but was in this stopped by Kapila or his philosophik schools, which brings this Sagara or Sakara down to near Godama Budha’s time. In Kaldia the great annual fete to Anu and Bel was called Saki; and Sakh, Sekhet, Sakti, &c., form an important group of words bearing on arks and their phalik gods, thus:— With Egyptians, SAKH, SEKGT, SEKT, SEKHET, SKHEM, SKHEN, SEKH, SEKAR, SHEKA, SAKARA, SOCHARIS, Sakh was a deity called “The Illumintor” and when fem., the “home, ark or boat of life,” the Sekht, Sekhet, or Sekt or gate, sacred to the “Lord of the Gate,” Lock or Yoni—the Dwārka Nāt or Siva of Hindus. Skhem has the same meaning, but also to “embrace” or “place of embrace.” The Sekh or Sakh was the Ruler or Protector; and Shekha a high title, from which has probably come the Arabic Sheikh or tribal leader. Sakara or Socharis was the Lingam god of the Amonium in the Lybian desert, and of the district of Memphis.

The trans-oceanic Bâlis describe their Meru as the original phalik cone—“the source of all fertility and navel of the earth,” the region of the Jugandere, Maruts or Air gods, and of the planetary deities. But “heavens” are generally transported from time to time to the neighbourhood of the worshippers. Hindus placed theirs beyond the high 1 Cf. pages 21, 86-87, 97, 176-179."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

The tree is that which flourishes on the stone as “the seat of know-ledge”and “leading symbol of doctrins,” and Budha is now the wise one who gave these emblems to their Samana Deba—“the Archangel of all Bali-ah” or planetary existences. Upham though strictly orthodox, suggests that the images burned by David, the dancing Arkite (2 Sam. v. 21), were figures made like the Ceylonese Balis in “relievo on frames, to propitiate the planetary powers of the Baalim, and which they set up preparatory to making their offerings and dancings.” And this seems most likely, seeing that Jews had Kuthim (from which race the Drâvidas sprang) as instructors, and that they, the Jews, worshipped and served Báalim and all the host of heaven, and that the names Baal and Jehovah (Yahu-ê) often interchange even in our faulty Old Testament translation. Up to Hosea’s time, the Jewish God was called Bâali or Bāli, and after that time—said to be the 8th century—was directed to be called Ishe, or as we would say, Ish-vāra the Fire or Ash-god. The best spiritual faith has gross and material parts, for like a pure stream it has often to pour its crystal waters through fetid channels. Thus the doctrine of a Hell of eternal and unspeakahle torment, meted out to every irresponsible descendant of rude parents who only tasted a forbidden apple, and the slaying of a good god to appease the wrath of an angry one, is paralleled in the growths which have followed upon the all but immaculate teaching of the pious Godama, as manifested in that awful chapter and its fiendish pictures, which Upham gives us on the Hells of the Budhistik Balis of Ceylon. “It is not uncommon,” says Dr. Daby, “to sea a Devale, or demon shrine, and a Vehâri or Budhist temple, contiguous, or even under the same roof . . . . Nay this is not only tolerated, but quite orthodox” among the Ceylonese, “although nothing can be more heterodox” to the true faith. As Satan dwelt with Jehovah in heaven, and Christ listened to him on the mountain-top and gaves devils a place when casting them out of men, so Budha, say Balis, “countenanced their phalik god Samana by the delivery to him of his ‘seat of power and sacred tree,’ ”2 or the Minny Phalange and Palol, true phalik emblems, and as foreign to the ideas of the good ascetik as the Christitan hell must have been to the proclaimer of a gospel of love, forgiveness of sins and mercy. Both faiths owe these hells and all the consequent gloom and misery .of their most sincere believers to priests, who ever distrusting (even while they preached “good tidings of great joy”) the belief that love is stronger for good than servile fear, and dreading also the loss of their own influence and livelihood, gradually went back to the old refrain that the “fear of Yahuê is the beginning of wisdom.” From such doctrines have millions of hearts, often the most loving, 1 Upham, p. 48.  2 Ibid., p. 130."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Hells, and other False Teachings of Budhist Priests. 489gentle and sincere, suffered for some two thousand years the most poignant anguish, only betraying their misery by the gloomy brow and anxious and “fearful” heart. “The Great Master” commanded, nay besought all to seek for happiness in doing good without hope of reward or fear of punishment; for knowing of no hereafter, Budha refused to found his gospel of love and duty on the unprovable. He urged his disciples only to teach this doctrine, neither deviating thereftom. to the right hand nor to the left; but the priests had no abiding faith in man’s love of goodness, and though they turned not eye or body to the right or left as they went forth amidst the dwellings of their fellow-men seeking their daily alms; yet otherwise they early began to subvert their Master’s teaching. They announced that there were eight great hells of unspeakable torment for all the crimes and omissions of men, and that those who did not believe what they taught, and did not give them alms, would not only go to the worst of all the hells, but remain in it through all their unbelieving eternity.1 From all other sins, said these false teachers, the torments of one or other of the hells would in a short season purge the sinner, but not so could the sin of unbelief in what they would call their “gospel evidences” be forgiven; nor could he escape the 8th Hell, who taught that “there was no merit in bestowing alms,” though the holy Budha actually insisted upon this last, in these very words! Mr. Upham, like a great number of other writers from Humboldt downwards,2 is strongly impressed with the idea that the early South Indians, Javanese, Balis, &c., have come from the same stock as the ancient Mongols, Akads, Kaldus and Egyp-tians; and though “now separated by a vast extent of country,” that even Tolteks, Azteks, and the old Mexikan builders “must have originated in one and the same point of the ancient continent.” Our studies have also for some years past led gradually up to a somewhat similar but more defined conclusion; viz., that the Centre was an Aithi-opik or Meru-opik stock, which spread from High-Asia as Eruthreans, Akads, Kaldus, Kuths or Kusis, Kemis or Ai-gupts, Keti, Hami or Hamaths, Kanāns, &c.; and while these sheets were passing through the press, we have seen Asyriologues coming to the same conclusion. The last dozen chapters of M. Lenormant’s excellent little volume on Chaldean Magic is full of such matter, and goes far to upset a great number of too straight laced dogmas as to the classification of early languages. Fornander’s Polynesia has also valuable matter to the same effect. From Turanians (Merus, Akads and Egypttians) did the magic and mythologies of Arabians, Zoroastrians, Greeks and Latins spring; whilst Egypt, “however far we go back,” says M. Lenormant, gave to Western Aryans and Shemites “the grand idea of a divine unity.”3 We have since found a copy among the records of the XIX. Dynasty, (the original of which may be any age subsequent to the 1st Dynasty) 1 Upham’s Buddhism, pp. 100-110. 2 Ibid.

Lenormant calls the analogue of Silik-Mulu-Khi. This was the name of man’s first Savior whom the early Akadian deity Aku termed “My Son,” when he sent him with a message of peace and good will to man.3 To the same Turanian source is also traced Fire worship, and that Ophiolatry which identified the serpent with the bad principle, and personified this in Angra-mainyus,4 who finally came to be worshipped with Ahura Mazda. This serpent as Ahi-Dahaka conquered Thraetona, the analogue of the Vedik Trita; but the first Serpent was no Satan. Serpent worship was and is prominent in all Turanian religions, and all the efforts of the good Aryan Budha could not dislodge the sacred reptile from Asia, nor could Christianity from Europe. St Patrick is fabled to have turned him bodily out of lreland, but not out of his Bible and liturgies, where be is still the subtle one by whose aid alone mankind have tasted of the “Tree of Knowledge,” and but for the Elohim or Yahuê-Ale-im, he would also have made men immortal, like unto them! Hea, the great Vāna or Water God, the Oanes of Turano-Akads, was the first western Serpent-God-idea. His seven solar attributes were depicted by his seven heads and a weapon of seven parts. The Egyptian seems to depict a simi- lar god in this fig. 325, where as the great land ser- pent he is shown carrying along with him religion and national power—Rano and Horos—with the insignia of Empire. Hea, said Akads, points to the solar pathway and controls the creative energies of nature as the Argha Nāth or God of the sacred boat of the Sun. He is shown by the picture writers of the Nile (near connections of Akads), as a canopying serpent leading (fig. 326) the Ram-headed Creating God Num or K’neph-Ra, and in fig. 327 as bearing along intelligence in his Baris, symbolized in the god- 1 Euterpe [i.e. lib.

As time passed on, the good Hea was only known as the hell and water god, and much lost in his holy son, the second Savior-idea, Marduk. Gradually Ophis fell into disrepute, and Apophis became a Satan, but of this more hereafter. M. Lenormant shows that the Turano Akadian, Kushian or “Kassian” languages and religions, have been the foundations on which the Shemites of Babylonia, Arabia, Asuria and Suria built, and therefore also those on which the Aryan constructed his mythologies, and from which he drew the terms used in these, though they belonged more to Aithiopo-Phen-akes and Egyptians. Thus Asyrian gleaned only in Kusho-Shemitik pastures, as did the Shemitik Terahites when they emigrated into the country of Malek-i-Zedek, that servant of “the High God,” whose Lingam so long stood on the mount of his tribe, thc coveted I-u-salem of later Terahites. Old as was Babylon, it was a modern and heretical city to the Tin-tir of the ancient Eastern Turano-Kushes or Kassi u Ak-kadi, as M. Lenormant translates the still earlier rendering of Sumeri-u Akkadi, a name marking the oldest solo-phalik ideas. Bab-el or “Gate of Il,” was the third, and a Shemitik city, which rose on or near to the ruins of Kâ Dingira, the “Gate of God,” as the Akads called the second city which they built near to old Tin-tir, “the Sacred Tree” or Linga. The civilization of the Turans, about 3000 B.C., was wider and in some respects superior to that of the Shemite Monarchies of Babylon or Asyria down to their historik period; and it was markedly scientific, mechanical and constructive, as we find it thus characteristic of the race, on the Nile, the Ganges and in Drāvida. They were, says M. Lenormant, “in possession of a remarkable civilization, a sedentary and agricultural life, a steady industry, and above all an organized government;” and this is shown by the governments which followed them borrowing far down into Aryan days their scientific, literary, military, judicial and religious or ecclesiastical terms. They were designated the clever and god-like Aithiopian Kephts, Caphtorim and Kephenes of an eponymous Kepheus, and the learned Kaldis of the furthest East, were but their Kaldus or priestly tribe of their Kusds, Kuths or Kuses or Chusdim, as Hebrews named these.1 According to their own traditions and the writers of Genesis they were the great tower builders who came “from the East to the land of Shinar,” from “the cradle of the human race and the Place2 of the Assembly of the God;” and they brought with them to the Euphrates a written language, for they were those 1 Cf.

Chinese writing,”1 which they had developed “beyond the Kuen-lun.” The Akadian “system of computations and mathematics, is exactly like that . . . . . existing amongst the Vigurs, Mongols and Mantchoos, and the Hoang-ti of China, and proceeds on the same base as that of the far back Yugas or ages of India; there is nothing analogous among Shemitik races.”2 But before these vastly ancient Kusis, there were in Babylonia as in Drāvidia, a dark aboriginol population called by M. Lenormant a “Melanian race,3 black with smooth hair like the Ghonds of India . . . . . with whom the people of Ham coalesced.” Among these Kuso-Melans sprang up an intense system of magic, gradually working up to Bel or Baal worship, just as took place in the growth of Ceylonese Bali-ism; but in in the Ceylon forests, so too “in the great marshes round the Persian Gulf . . . . . the culture of the great cities has never had much influence;” nor have the cities of India, Dravidian or Aryan, much affected the Balis of Ceylon and the Sunda ilands. Even down to the time when the Aithi-opes seemed lost in the Shemito-Babylonian Asyrians of say the 8th century B.C., the eminent anthropologist Dr. Hanny sees in them a people “resembling the Ugro Finnic and Siberian races . . . . . or Mongoloides:” and, adds M. Lenormant, “the monarchs of the last Babylonian em. empire” claimed to belong to the old lineage which was considered “even more noble than that of the Kushites or Cephenes” or Kephts, and these last Babylonian Kings “belonged to a type acknowledged as Mongolic, as may be seen by an image on one of the black stones in the British Museum.”4 “We can fix even the date,” says Lenormant, “of 2000 B.C.,” when the old Akadian dynasty of Babylonia was overthrown by a politico-religious revolution, and can see that they then sang dolorous hymns about their ancient high Asiatik “Mountain of the World,” the Mero of their race as Meru-opes. This was the Olumpos in which their gods resided, and within it waa their “Hades,” the land of “no return,” surrounded by seven walls supplied with only one door; and from it issued the first River of the Waters of Life or Immortality5— figures and ideas which Eastern and Western Aryans and Shemites have alike adopted. Bryant seems right in his conclusion that “this highly religious people” were called after their Sun-God Achad, and Egyptians who only knew them as “the Akti of Babylon,” said their solar deity was Aka or Aku, a Kuthite name for God. Still with old Kelts, Auggh, Agh or Achad is the sacred field and a Divine name, and Aka, Acha, Ak or Akra was an Egyptian term for a solar deity. Ak long continued as the Supreme God of Ur-ek, which this word would indeed signify when read backwards, and Shemites often so reversed words and languages, reading from right to left. Their most ancient Babylon was Ek or Eki, and all old places containing Ek in their designa- 1 Chaldean Magic, p. 363, quoting A. Remusat. 2 Ibid., p. 366.

Ach-aians or Akais were their brethren, as will be seen further on; of course, the readers should bear in mind our Tables, p. 12, which can now be added to with effect from the researches of the last half dozen years. Ako-man, though latterly the “first of the Evil Darvands,” who aided Ahriman in his Titanik war against the new sun-god Ahur-Mazda, was clearly a fallen god, and perhaps once connected with the Egyptain “Son of the Sun” Aktis, “the Sunbeam,” who has probably left his name on the African tribe of Solarists called the Akras. Being a Mountain or Olumpian deity, the name would naturally descend to us as “The High One,” meaning “the erect God,” for Aka, says Lenormant, is a Heap, Acervus or Hermes. And so Akads have been called “Mountaineers,” and Sum-irs, “dwellers on the plains,” but without sufficient reason. We are now, how-ever, told that in the cuniform, Sumir is the same thing as Shinar,” and that Akads and Sin-ars “were of the same race;”1 so that it is clear that they were simply called so after their two favourite gods, Aku and Sin, for Ar is here as usual “Lord” or “God;” and Sin or Shin is still a God amidst their original high Asian brethren the Sinas or Chinese. There too we see their Zi-Ana in the Thian or “Heaven God” of China, and in Shin or Ching, “a God or Spirit.” Zi has become Ti, but still the Pillar God, I, and if accompanied by O, then Shang or Sin Ti, “the perfect” or “Supreme.” With their travelled brethren in the two Americas, the same divine name is continued in Téa, Téo, &c., and Aryans kept up the refrain in their Ze-us, The-os, De-us, Teut, &c. Indeed this Teo is often still a karn god and repre-sented by a peaked mountain, pyramid, tower, obelisk, high or prominent headland, &c., such as Greeks called Ak-ron, without knowing the old root Ak; for these Aryans only came on Akadian lands, 800 years after the Akadian language had fallen into disuse. Of course they did not know what Akadian scholars have only now found out, that this language had had a literary development among a civilized and settled people long “before any Kushite, Semitic, or Aryan influence had made itself felt”2 between the Persian Gulf and Aithiopian Syria; for there the Greeks found it a decaying and de-Turanized tongue. M. Lenormant demonstrates3 that the Akado-Althiopes were philologically and religiously connected with the Ugro Finik Tartars; and thus we find amongst these races the origin of many of our Christmas solo-fire rites. The Solo-Fire Gods Paiwa and Utu of Fins, are shown to be the same as the Akad “God Dhubar or Is-dhubar; whilst the Fin male-Moon God, Kuu, corresponds exactly with the Aku, Eni-zun or Ita of the Akadians.” The Akadian magic formula banishes evil demons to the sandy desert, as the Jew condemned Azazel with his load of wintry sorrows; and so “the Finnish runa seuds the plague away to Lapland” (p. 321). Alike with Akads and Fins, is that typical word Son, called Tur, Tar or Tār, the sprout, fiery one or fire-protector, because fire-continuer of the tribe; whilst the phalus, a germ, semen, 1 Lenormant, Chaldean Magic, pp. 388, 397, 399. 2 Ibid., pp. 374-5. 3 Ibid., chap. xvi."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

Western Aryans gleaned much in language as well as learning from the founders of Erech, Ur-uk, or Ur-aku, “the Eternal City;” they too called their cities or little clusterings around their Ur, or “God of Fire and Light,” their Urs or Oors, as Indo-Aryans—taught by Meruopes and Drāvidas—still do. It is historically clear from the cuniform. tablets that the Aithiopes possessed “the five things essential,” according to M. Renan, “to constitute the individuality of a race, viz., a Language of its own, a Literature imprinted with a peculiar physiognomy, a Religion, a History, and a Legislation,” although we might take exception to some of these conditions. Their Literature was not only “very original,” say Asyrio-loges, but was “inspired by a breath of true poetry, and introduced poetry amongst some of the Semitic tribes.” It was the foundation of Hebrew poetry as pointed out in our seventh chapter on Kaldia. Their legialation was recorded on tablets some thirty centuries before the quasi Mosaik, and is in some respects, not only more humane and enlightened but even superior to that of Europe of to-day. Their law required. that the son who denies his father should seek forgive-ness, and that he who denied his mother should have his hair out off and be banished the town. But the parents who drove their children from their door were themselves to be banished from the state. The wife who forsook her husband might be killed, but the husband who divorced his wife must support her, and what she brought to him at marriage she had always a right to. “She shall remain the owner of her own,” said the ancient Turano-Akad, and is “not the mere creature of her spouse.” Nay, “in her relations with her children she was even tho superior of the father,” all of which laws are now considered wiser and more just than many of the present day. In regard to slaves also, this early people were more humane than either the Jewish or Christian slave holders of the beginning of this century; for the Akadian required that the slave should be supported and compensated if injured or ill, from no fault of his own. See further Lenormant’s tablet translations, and other given in Records of the Past.3 With reference to the sharp separation which some philologists insist on between the Shemitik, Aryan and all Turanian tongues, M. Lenormant states as an historical fact that “the population who apoke the Semitic language in Babylonia and 1 Chaldean Magic, chap. xxii. 2 Ibid., p. 342. 3 Ibid., cap. xxxi. [cf.

This will be more fully developed as we proceed, but let us here point to the traces of this family of peoples beyond the Indian Seas. POLYNESIAN KUTHS.—We are constantly reminded of Indo-Kuths in Milanesia and of the Tri-Lingaites of the Indian coast, in the so fondly dwelt on “Paradise” of the Polynesians, called by them K’Ling. This they say is a mythik land, far away west in our Indian Archipelago, from which they were long ages ago driven into Ocean, and latterly forced still further off by a great Malay wave of well-known modern times. Putting aside this we see here a far older people by the unmistak- able signposts of languages, gods, rites and customs. They went southwards even to Australia, thinks the learned Professor of Anthropology of Paris,1 as he notices “Drâvidian idioms” on the great continent; but the warmer climate of the two Javas and Siam would be more to their taste, and there are strong advocates of the doctrine, that Siam has decided Egyptian characteristics. According to Fornander2 (than whom few have here a better right to instruct us), the Drâvidas, or Indo-Kuths, have continued their name Yava throughout Polynesia “in numerous dialectic forms,” as in Hawa-ii, or “fiery Java.” This Circuit Judge, who speaks many of the lanugages of Oceana, says they “partake of Aryan forms . . . but more primitive than the oldest Aryan . . . which everywhere abundantly crops out;” showing, he things “a Cushite Arabian type, marking the Polynesian family as the recipient of a Cushite civilization, and to such an extent as to almost entirely obscure its own consciousness of parentage and kindred to the Aryan stock.” He holds that the Western Cushite, Sabean or Aithiopik civilization, long preceded Aryan, and appeals to the proofs which Babylonian tablet literature is yearly furnishing as to Cushite Akads, and to traces which Huxley and others point out, of Eastern aborigines like native Australians having passed through India, especially by the Narbada valley; also to Polynesian terms for north and south, for the times and quarters, for rains or monsoons, which have no meaning amidst the islands of either the Central or Northern Pacific; as well as names for hedlands, deities, heroes, legends and mythologies, all traceable he says, only to “the continental homes of far back Indo-Cuthic forefathers.” We may credit our author so far without committing ourselves to his more minute Biblical and such like speculations, as that thePolynesian I w i is “Mother Eve,” and N u u Noah, that the Kuas stand for Kushites, and Sabas for the Sabeans or Sabines.

The missionary, Rev. W. Gill. in his South Pacific Myths, calls our attention to the Polynesian Genesis, or Creation by Vatea, “Father of gods and men;” and gives us this higbly phalik ideograph, in which he justly sees a parallel to the Fish-Gods of Kaldea, as do we to the Fish Avatâr of Hinduism and other faiths already so fully illustrated;2 but we also see in this half-man and half-fish, the horrible fact—only too common in the infancy of faiths—that man was bestial in thought, and especially so in his creation legends. It is usual now to explain these legends as solar myths, and Mr. Gill was told various such tales in answer to his enquiries as to Vatea and his “better half.” In these old and new world parallelisms we must guard against arguing that they show only a continuation of the same faith, bearing in mind the all but universal law, that man in like stages of his growth and in like circumstances will excogitate like mythologies, rites and aymbolisms. Nevertheless these parallelisms as well as archeology and philology are undoubtedly pointing to the exploitation eastwards through Siberia, China and the Pacific Ocean of this old civilizing race. When lost amongst Papuans, Samaons, Maoris, &c., they seem to have reappeared in strength on the Pacific coast of the two Americas. Who but these wondrous old builders—possibly called Kheti by Egyptians, from their word Ket or Khet, to build—could have reared the grand massive structures, so like to the “giant cities of Bashan,” and the gigantic cut stones of Bâlbek, which we find in the Americas amidst pathless forests and prairies? and who but these engineers could have opened up otherwise impassable mountains, and planted among them so many symbolisms of the solo-phalik faiths of far distant Asiatik and Egyptian homes? No one can study the mass of facts collected in books on American antiquities without coming to the conclusion which Mr Bradford ably sums up towards the close of his volume; viz., 1 Zool. Myth., Chap. Mouse. We only saw Fornander’s volumes when this was in press. Had he more usually written Aithope for “Arians,” throughout his work, we would endorse it, but he missed this, the key to his subject. 2 Vol. I., figs. 100, 103, 110-116, pages 230, 231, 244-257, with which cf. “Tartar idol,” Pl.

Asia there issued a long continued pulsating stream of population upon all the ilands of the Pacific; and that this passed through Polynesia towards Easter and.other ilets, not far from the Chilian and Peruvian coasts, and northwards by Faning’s iland (on which though now deserted we still find many of their well-known remains), to the Sandwich group, and hence towards Mexiko. It is established by numerous well-ascertained facts as to the moves of drifting boats—not to speak of properly navigated ones,—that both ancient and modem men have passed over much greater distances than those ilet spaces, which form the links in that continuous belt connecting Eastern Asia with the American mainland. Easter ile, off the Chilian coast, seems to have been not only a tête d’appui, but a fixed depot for successive invasions of colonizers. Mr. Bradford quoting various writers, says that “here are pyramidal edifices and colossal obelisks and statues, closely analogous to the American monuments.” There are pyra-mids formed by “layers of stone cut with great precision, and upon their summits are enormous colossal statues of the same material, some of them 27 feet high, and representing human figures. . . . The stone work and sculpture . . . . are superior to any found among the more numerous and civilized tribes inhabiting the South Sea islands. . . . The exactness and skill of the workmanship, though destitute of cement, forms a strong and durable pile.” One single stone, “forming a human figure to the waist,” measured 25 by 5 feet wide, and another (one of seven statues or busts), was 27 feet long by 7 feet in diameter, says Mr. Ellis; so that a greater than the Bâlbek builders was here; in fact, none other than the architects of Philê and Karnak them-selves. These passed by the Sunda group into Melanesia and thence to N. Zealand, where their shrines degenerated into Māoris or Druid-like circles.2 In the Peruvian Antiquities of Reiss and Stübel and in Squier’s Land of the Inkas, we learn also that along the South American coasts, Māoris or circles of stones, semi-circles and squares, and cromlechs of massive unhewn stones, and other remains common to the Pheni-cians and Arabians of Asia and the old races of India, still abound. Some of these stone circles says Bradford, enclose considerable mounds and often large pyramids formed of coral, basalt or lavas, as the graduated pyramid of Atehuru, which rises to 50 feet high from a base of 270 by 94; that at Maeva, which has a square base of 120 foot wide, and one at Ruapua, which is 150 by 70 feet at base.3 It was doubtless .ruder northern tribes of the same great Turan race who passed through Northern Asia by the easy route of the Aleutian iland belt, and raised the strange tumuli, pyramidal mounds, and animal figures which are to be found over so many states of the Union, from Lake Erie and New York to Florida, and from the western banks of the Mississippi to the Atlantik. We show several of these in our Plates VI. 1 American Antiquities, History of Red Race, New York, 1841. 2 Throughout Polynesia, a Māori is a temple or encircled mound. 3 Ibid., chaps. xi. and xii. 4 Indians call them Nane-Yah, or “Monuments of God,” “Houses of the Great Spirit,” p. 167.

As a rule these northern works are of mud, because earth was abundant and water near, just as we find similar structures in Mesopotamia and Northern Europe; but where required, as at Newark, Ohio. the pious builders did not shirk stone work, and some mounds in Arkansas and Florida are composed entirely of shells,1 reminding us of the Druid circle near Penrith, which is formed of pebbles gathered from an adjoining sacred stream. In Nuttal’s Arkansas he says that upwards of 5000 of the old earth-works may be seen in the western country, some of which enclose more than one hundred acres; and mounds and tumuli are there most numerous and extensive. The earthworks look like fortresses; with flank defences and city ramparts; others seem to have formed roads and embankments to keep off inundation, whilst some were evidently circuses for games, having like the Roman Cursus a mound at the end of an oval enclosure. The remains also show skill and taste in stone sculpture, pottery and bricks, with, says Humbolt (p. 161), Greek arabesks, crosses and Etruskan-like work in vases and urns with the free use of copper, lead, gold and silver. Palenque yields medallions, busts and ornamented figures sitting like the Hindu deities on thrones cross-legged, and with attendants, some dancing and waving palms, others engaged in prayer or with human sacrifices before an altar, on which stands a cross surmounted by a bird.2 Aqueducts and tunnels (p. 137) remind us of the works elsewhere noted as con-structed in Spain and the Mediteranean ilands by some ancient races akin to Kuths, whilst phalik objects, more or less gross, and “sacred footprints” take us back to the universal Paduka Puja of Asia and other veiled forms of organ worship. Of course we only speak of ruins, the origin of which, as “M. Burkart says, date long before the conquest of Mexiko by the Spaniards,” or as the natives of Tia-huanako or Guanico, the oldest Peruvian city, told Vega, “long before the time of the Incas, who built Cuzco in imitation of them” (pp. 143-5 and 161). This writer describes “great doorways or gates cut out of an entire and single stone, and placed upon stones of an incredible size, some of which were 30 by 15 by 6 feet.” Huge statues of men or idols are found, and in a Kuzko quarry, some two thousand gigantic blocks of half-cut stone. The masonry of the temple and fortress of the Sun at Kuzko is polygonal and fitted so closely, that like the uncemented stones of the Egyptian pyramids, “a sheet of paper cannot be slipped into the joints;” but Kusko belongs probably only to our 9th century, showing that Peruvians had not degenerated, as Mr. Ferguson would say, till the Aryans dominated the land. Similarwork is however, found elsewhere and north-wards to Kaxa Mark, where, in a quarry, is an unfinished Lingam-like block, 39 feet by 3 feet; and lying down on a commanding site in the centre of a circle 24 feet in diameter, is another, 11 feet by 2 feet 8 inches by 1 foot 3 inches, now called the Inga-Rirpo, or “Inka’s Resting Stone.” From such a Linga came our Westminister “Resting Stone.” In Guiana we find (p, 159) sculptured tigers, snakes and crocodiles; and, as in 1 American Antiquities, chap. iv.  2 Ibid., chap. v."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"Aithiopik Ruins and Symbols in Polynesia and the Americas. 499Asia, on the perpendicular faces of lofty precipicesr strange hieroglyphics with suns and moons, reminding us of the Syrian homes of the old Kheti and Hamathites. Chili too and the banks of the Orinoko yield pillars and other stones having cyphers and strange characters with figures of animals and sacred footprints. Nor is the Indian phalik tortoise a wanting. This worship was evidently strong at the great shrine of Uxmal in Yukatan. One of its sacred courts is paved with 43,669 stones, upon each of which are four turtles facing inwards, thus forming the conventional phalik radii of the sun wheel already explained by us at pages 444-445 and elsewhere. Here too, on a lofty and remarkable pyramid, were “caryatides of cut stone, with arms crossed on their heart, and ear appendages and head dresses, and instruments in their hands,” exactly like Egyptians. In a Mexikan temple was a porphyritik stone 27 foot in circumference, having “in the centre a head in relief, representing the sun with a yawning mouth and protroding tongue, similar to the image of Kâla.” (Bradford). Procreating gods are usually so depicted. Here too was the goddess Teo-Yamiqui, a serpentine, colossal and at one time painted figure, hewn out of a solid block of basalt 9 feet high. Her drapery and arms were formed of snakes, her feet were tiger’s claws, and on her sides were the wings of a vulture, whilst she wore as a necklace, human hearts, hands and skulls, and was therefore a perfect personification of the Indo-Drâvidian Kali. The bronze Osiris in the Museum of Velletri, and the Egyptian veil or Kalantika on the figures of the pillars of Dendara, have their counterparts, says Humbolt, in the sculptures of old Mexiko, whilst the inclined door posts of Egypt are common in old Peruvian structures,1 and obeliskal towers occur all about lake Titikaka, reminding us of those of Phenicia and Ireland (p. 154). Water and especially sacred lakes, from those near Mexico to all over Peru and China were worshipped, and most of the shrines of these builders, were, when possible, reared on the margins of lakes and rivers (p. 169), just as in Asia. We seem to even see the Solo-phalik patriarch Shem or Cham in the old Chilian Them or Chem, whom they called their “great ancestor,” and they were Solarists who worshipped him on the Theghin or “Fiery Mountain” (p. 192 .and in caves, as became children of “Mithras of the cave.” In his last chapter Mr. Bradford sums up to the following effect, as results fully supported throughout his work— I.

America; and considers them, as we do, the earliest and, until mid-Grecian days, the most cultivated branch of the human family. He urges that the American aborigines were connected “with these several countries by striking analogies in their arts, their customs and traditions; their hiero-glyphical painting, their architecture and temple building, their astronomical systems, and their superstitions, religions and theocratical government;” but they were so far ahead of Tartars, Mongols and Siberians, that one cannot attribute the old civilizations of the Central Americas to such wild hordes, though we can see some of their blood in the copper-coloured Siberian and even in the Eskimo of that same hue, now as widely apart from the Turano-Aithiop as is the Anglo-Saxon from the Indo-Aryan. Mr Bradford and other American antiquaries allow that some of the wild tribes of North America, as the Chipewyans, Sioux, Pawnis, &c., may have crossed from Siberia, but certainly not Mexikans, Tolteks, Chiapanese, Mayas and Peruvians. He finds that all “the ancient monuments in Siberia are situated to the west and south;” and that those of America are limited in their extent on the North-West, and that there is an astonishing resemblance in American native history “to many of the features of the most ancient types of civilization in the Eastern hemisphere.” The sculpturings of the pyramidal temples and palaces, bespeak traditions interwoven “with cosmogonical fables which still retained relics of primitive history. The old religion must have been sublime and just, in many of its original doctrines, though debased by superstitious abuse and corruption. In all, there is nothing modern, nothing recent; these features are not strictly Hindu, Egyptian or Chinese, though they approximate this aboriginal civilization to that of each of these nations. . . . . The origin of the resemblance is to be traced back to the earliest ages when these great nations first seperated and carried into Egypt, India, China and America, the same religion, arts, customs and institutions, to be variously modified under the influence of diverse causes.” (p. 433) In regard to present Polynesia, the later Malay wave though mixed from its base with Turans, Aryans, Indo-Kaukasians and Mongols, has all but effaced the older races, and left as the best class throughout the Pacific, a people in hue, light tawny to deep bronze; with hair usually lank and black, beard weak, eyes black and oblique, nose full and broad towards apex; mouth large and sensual, face bones prominent, head rather compressed, and body robust but not tall.

The old languages of Amerika and other details bear out our researches as to race, but on these points we must refer the reader to the works of Humbolt, Dr. Lang Marsden and others, quoted by Mr. Bradford in his 7th and 10th chapters. He shows from Heeren’s and other Researches, “the usual picture writing of the Mexikans resembles that seen on the clothing of Egyptian mummies; . . . . that there are real phonetik hieroglyphics in those signs which appear upon the heads of the gods; and which, like the Egyptian, are enclosed in an oblong rectangle” (p. 377), or else in an Egyptian-like anaglyph. The priests of both peoples were recluses, and both had sacred mirrors like ancient and modern Chinese and Japanese. Their very temples are often called “The House of Mirrors,” and Tez-Katli-poka is even translated “The Shining Mirror God,” as well as “The black shining stone” (pp. 338, 379); and we shall see when treating of Japanese faith how accurately this agrees with the Budhistik developments of solo-phalik Shintoism. The Mexikan and other ancient Amerikan sculptures are held “to be fully equal to the Egyptian in elegance, execution and precision of outline. In both we see figures seated cross-legged on couches; the priests of both have occasionally masks and a shaved or tonsured head, and the women hold sacred offices; both races tatoo-ed and wore conical caps and feathers, beads and bracelets, and used a flute of four holes in sacred services. The dramatic entertainments and religious dances and processions were identical, and both manufactured paper, one fram the papyrus, and the other from the Agane or aloe (p. 381). Many also of the old world stories have these ancient builders carried to their far western homes. Thus as in Babylon they had “giant builders, floods and great towers,” by which they tried to reach unto heaven. Here too they so frightened the immortal gods, that in Mexiko as at Babel these cried out, “Go to, let us go down and there confound their language.” The orthodox: Delitzach wrote: “The Mexikans have a legend of a tower-building as well as a flood. Xelhua, one of the seven giants (cf. Noah’s eight) rescued in the flood, built the great pyramid of Cholula in order to reach heaven, until the gods, angry at his audacity, threw fire upon the building (it was probably struck by lightning), and broke it down, whereupon every seperate family received a language of it's own.” This western shrine of Bel-us was also a terraced pyramid like those in Kaldia and Egypt, correctly oriented and dedicated to the Sun God. But enough, for we could add infinitely to the proofs that the old Kuthite builders were here. We shall now advance further evidence of their presence amongst the proto-Aryans and Aryans of India, for we can there see them alike in historik times as in more or less legendary ages. They exercised an unmistakable influence upon the rude aborigines and the early non-building Aryan tribes. INDO-KUSHITES.—The great Visma-Mitra or solar Visvas were a strongly marked artizan class, who are still called Kusikas or Kousikas, and came to India, wrote Mr Farrier,1 from Kush, to this day the name of a river near the As-ia Palus, 1 Calcutta Review, and Garret’s Clas.

These Kusis were, he justly thinks, of the famous Skuthik race, who held Balk or Bâl-ak in remote antiquity, and whose bricks Sir H. Rawlinson found at Susa, and on the Persian Gulf, engraved with cuniform Skuthik legends. We are assured that “Babylon had numerous names of places denoting their long dominion there. Even in the tablets of the 7th century the river Kutha appears as Nahr Kuti,”1 or the Kutha Nalah, as we still use this word in India. Asyrians up to the very last speak of all Aithiops as Kusus, and we have found the teak of India or Barma amid the ruins of Mugheir or Ur, and mention of Indian muslin, Sindhu, the Hebrew Sadin, and Greek Sindōn on the tablets of Babylon.2 The Calcutta Reviewer thinks that the Skyths “did not come to the Cushites, but that these colonized Mongolia as they did Arabia, Ethiopia, and the north coast of the Indian Ocean.” Indra we know was a son of Kusika, and Fire and Indra worship (that is Indth or Aith, as already shown) seem to have been introduced by the Visva-Mitras, and to have supplanted a previous Sun worship of earlier immigrants, or more likely a lower fetish faith. Kush, continues Farrier, “is largely used in the local nomenclature of Central Asia, as in Kaspian, Kash-gar, Kashmir, Khas-saks (Sacæ or Cossaks), Caucas-es, or Khâs mountains, Cossæ or Cisii in Persia, the Bal-kash lake and the Kush,” and doubtless in the Hindu Kush mountains, north of which lay he Meru of Meru-opes or Aithi-opes. Now Visva or Visvesa is a very important mother. The earliest solar mythology describes her as the daughter of the oldest great patriarch, the Prajâpati Dăksha, who sprang from the thumb of Brahma, and who is identified with the Aditi, a race known to us in Arabia as Ad-ites or early Sabean Aithiops. Daksha was a ram or bull-headed deity, live the bovine Juno, whose many symbols have been discovered in the western cities of Aithiops, as at Truy, Mukenê, &c. He was the early B r a h m a-Yoni, a supreme God sitting on the lotus, as we still find him in India. The Rig Veda sings Daksha’s praises as the father of even the supreme gods Varuna and Mitra, the Eastern Mithras, and Egyptian Mitz-Rā. The ancient mother Visva was sister to a host of great gods, goddesses, and patriarchs. Several Purānas connect here with the ancient Daksha sacrifice, from which Sivaism arose a triumphant faith. Siva then decapitated and afterwards restored Daksha to life, though under the form of a Ram, which means that therr then arose a kind of Amonian Jovism. Indra was trampled on, Yama’s staff broken, Mitra, Sarasvati. Chandra, and in fact all the re-presentatives of the great old faiths, fell before a Sivo-Hinduism, which still dominates India.3 Visma married Dh ar ma—Grace and Justice, and became the mother of the Visva-devas, the still favourite household Lares and Penates of most of the homes of India. It was Visma-Mitra, the Kusaka, who was the Guru of the solar 1 Trans. Bib. Arch., VI. i. p. 74, and Proceedings of 2nd Dec. 1879. 2 Prof. Sayce, Lon.

His eldest son Kusamba founded Kanoj under its first name of Kausambi. One of the incarna-tions of Indra as Gādhi, was called a son of Kusāmba; and Kisika or “The Kusa” was the name of Krishna’s celebrated brother, and of a sacred river into which, says another tradition, Satya-vatī was turned. Now she was the great mother of Vyâsa and all Kauravas and Pāndavas—the Fish goddess Kālāngani; and her offspring by the Rishi Parâ-sara were produced on the Yamunā, pointing to the time when the Aryan kingdom here rose over the old Kuths or Kusis, and also to the first Aryan Avatāra, which begins with the Matsyodari or Fish-born one—a name of this mother Satya-vati or Kausalyā. Far away south on that coast where the early Eruthrean mariners used to sail with their Indian produce to Western peoples, on or near to the still known site of ancient Dvâraka, “the gate of the gods” and of India, stood a city called Kusa-sthali, or the station of Kusis or Kuthites. We might fill pages with similar referenoes to these old races. Thus Vishnu was the Visva-Rupa, and Bhutesa one of the Rudras or early forms of Siva; and it was a Vessa Raja of Magadha, claiming descent from the Kusa-loving Rama, who first suppressed the Kshatrya military sway, and “elevated fisher-men (note, childern of Kausalyâ), barbarians, Brahmans, and other castes to power”—a “levelling up,” which was one of the best characteristics of the great commerce-loving Aithiops and Phoiniks of the West; and which is the natural healthy result of a world-wide and energetic commercial spirit, requiring civil and religious liberty and a popular administration. Sir William Jones long ago came to the conclusion that it was a Kusean, Kusdean or Skuthian empire reigning in and about Irania (before an Asyrian kingdom was known of) that produced Hinduism and its principal languages and their offshoots. He thinks these Kushites or Skuths “spoke a primary Tartarian language, from which came Sanskrit, Zend, Chaldaic and Pahlavi, as well as Greek and Latin,”1 and that from such a race on the borders of the Kaspian (Kushbi ?) went forth most of the races of the world, very much on the lines delineated in our Pl. II, prefacing this volume. Thus, then, Kuths and Skyths, though differentiating sharply, but long afterwards, into language groups, seem in the far back ages we allude to—the Rhematic period—to have sprung from one great stock, and this is the argument of Quatrefages and many philologists. Professor Sayce writes that the Chusdim or “primeval Babylonians were the inventors of the cuneiform system of writing, the builders of the great cities of the country, the first students of mathematics and astronomy; in short, the originators of the culture and civilization which was handed on to the Shemites, by whom they were afterwards conquered and dispossessed. Contemporaneous records prove that Western Asia possessed its China in Turanian Akâd at least 5000 years ago, and that ‘the Wisdom of the Chaldeans’ stored up in their imperishable libraries of clay, was no imaginary dream of a later age, but a startling and solid fact.”2 Even before 1 See authorities quoted in Higgins’ Celtic Druids, p. 252. 2 Introductory Science of Language, by Rev.

Eastern Aborigines. 504“they developed the civilization of Elam and Chaldea,” continues this philologist, “we have yet to learn what was the civilization of their primitive forefathers, that people of the remote past who spoke the parent language of the Urai-Altaic speech.” Again, “From the earliest times, the religious and political tendencies of this race had begun to display themselves. . . . . Every object and force of nature was believed to be inhabitied by a spirit” of good or evil, who could alone be acted upon by or through a duly constituted priest. And in company with such beliefs, we see that “there existed a rich mythology, mostly solar and the creator of numberless lays and epics.”1 But this belongs to the dialektik and national style of language, from which have sprung all the mythologies of the western world, and probably the cosmogonies also, including the Jewish legendary Genesis. The sacred mountain of these Kushites, High El-vend or Bāgha-vend, the Bhaga-vati or High Sivaik god, was their second mythical Ala-lut or Ararat. It was the Western Kailāsa which rose above the waters, the mountain of Bhaga2 or god, the Tukt-u-Saleem, Throne or “Peak of Salvation,” and cradle of their Mesopotamian ancestors. Near to it lay their early Eden, and on its ethereal summit did their Noah land and offer the first sacrifices of earth. The Jew also claimed his Ala-lut or “Mountain Alê,” as the Afghan did his Sufed Koh, and the Kapanese his Fuja-yama with Izana-gi and IZana-mi. The original home of the whole family, of which “the Chaldeo-Elamites are only a branch,” lies, thinks Professor Sayce on philological grounds, “far to the North-West, among the slopes of the Altai range;” which strengthen our arguments as to their being the early instructors of high Asiatiks and Chinese, as well as of Hindus and Greeks. “The coincidences of early mythologies, fables and legends” are otherwise, says Sayce, very surprising.3 The Chinese Khitai or Khitans, says another able writer,4 “fill a notable place in Asiatic history. . . . . They conquered Northern China, and it was from them that medieval geographers and travellers derived the famous name of Cathay. . . . . The Russians to this day call the Chinese, Khitai, a name perhaps introduced by Arabs, whose adventurous merchants began to frequent the porta of China during the supre-macy of the Khitai.” The Turkish tribes of Central Asia all called the Khitai, Khatai, saying they dominated “over the various nomad tribes who occupied the country from the river Hurka to Turkestan, and from the Chinese wall to the country of the Tunguses. The Mongols and the tribes of Manchuria were either immediately subject to them or were tributaries.” This writer is more particularly speaking of mediæval times, but in the light of modern researches as to the Aithiopik Khetê of the Egyptian monuments—the Hiti, Chiti, or Hamaths of Arabia, Syria and Mesopotamia—Mr. Howorth’s words are pregnant of truths, and are statements of facts reaching back we believe to Aithiopik days. He thinks Arabs, and not Chinese or Russians, named these old civilizers of high Asia and China. The present Khitans say that they “sprang from the country which separates Manchuria from the deserts of Gobi,” which being called “Barin territory,” reminds us of that earliest Aithio- 1 Introductory Science of Language, II. p. 197. 2 Bhaga, Bagh, Bog, &c., are terms for God and western forms of Bhāva-vata or Siva. 3 Introductory Science of Languages, pp. 260-292. 4 Jour.

We saw in the case of Tyre how that name seems to have been carried westward also from Bahrein. These high Asian Khitans had, as was a necessity with all Aithiops, a sacred mountain in Barin called Bardan, where the patriarch of those Manchurian tribes, Pu tu, was born and buried; and hereabouts are still seen inscriptuions “hewn on enormous rocks and erected stones,” such as are found all over Aithipian Arabia. Mr. Howorth speaks of the ruins of some twenty-five vast cities, apparently situated about “their Olympus, Mu ye;” and calls these Khitans “fundamentally a Tungistic race, but at present ruled by a caste of Mongol origin.” Now the Chinese say they are descended “immediately from the Tong hu, a race of strangers who settled in the Sian-pi mountains,” and hence got the name of Siampi-s. It is significant that the word Khitai, “as written by the Chinese, is made up of two ideographs, one meaning a red colour. . . . and the other to scratch or tear . . . . .supposed to have been given them from their tatooing.” “The fabulous hero” of the great body of Khitans called “the eight tribes,” was born on a high mountain, “rode a white horse,” like Budha, and meeting “a woman in a little cart drawn by grey oxen—a darker race . . . . they married without any formality,” statements which point to an early national era and a solar mythology. The name of “the real creator of the Khitan empire” was sexual like that of Adám. It was Y e l u or I-er-u, “the strong one,” from Ere, Mongolian, which in Turkish is Er, “a man,” equivalent to Herr and Hur of Teutons and to Er-mes or Hermes, having as the radical meaning, the male sign. In the female line we are told a very Budhistik story, viz., that a great mother “conceived by a ray of the Sun [Faith] entering her womb,” and that the house in which she lay was “surrounded with a divine light or halo, and scented with all exquisite perfume;” that the infant hero appeared as a child of three years old, and was able to walk at three months; that “when one year old he talked and prophesied, and said he waa surrounded by divine guar-dians who protected him from harm; that from seven he spoke only of serious matters;”1 that in fact, his conception, birth and boyhood were like those of most demi-gods. Thus then these northern Khiti had all the mythoiogies and charac-teristics of the Aithiopik Eruthri; and we begin to see that pre-historik history does and will yet more unfold itself to diligent research, and teach us many lessons con-cerning the roots of fables, religions and languages. Japan as we will hereafter show was overrun by similar Manchurian races, who have left there the indelible impresses of their old faiths and polity. There still flourishes a fervid nature worship, especially of the femnle type, with all the Western Mirror symbolism, the Quiris spear or sword, and numerous stone emblems dear also to Arabian Kibla Arkites.2 The composers of the Rigveda had learned better, and sought after the Akadian sentiments as to the unity of the Godhead, at which we 1 Jour.

Though positive history be for ever silent, yet we seem to see that not for 6000 years only, but more certainly for 100,000, have our race wandered over all the earth, hunting, fishing and feeding flocks, then cultivating the ground, and finally barter- ing and trading. It was bccause they feared Nature and sought for increase to themselves, their flocks and herds, that they took to worshippmg fetishes, like to the fertilizing emblems which they saw in earth and heavens, and sang and prayed to these, trying to coax them into good humour or deter them from evil. Moreover, if within early historik times, when great nations had settled down under organized governments, wild hordes found no difficulty in moving from far Eastern Mongolia to Spain, and back again through Africa, sacking Imperial Rome and effacing great governments on their path, in spite of organized armies; how much easier must these skilful Aithiopik tribes, organized and civilized beyond all others of their day, have found it 5000 to 6,000 years B.C. to move over all Asia, and to settle amidst the nomads of India—poor wild woodsmen, like the Ceylonese Vedas or Western Indian bushmen? Hence we readily accept the Akadian development of earlier Eastern. mythologies, and especially those referring to the demi-gods concerned in the artizan pursuits of a Tubal Cain, Hephaistos or Vulcan, and all the fire worship, which we hear of in the legends of a Tvashtri, Visva-Karma, Takshāks,1 &c. These Magi or “great ones” it was felt, wielded the powers of the gods, for they alone could forge the bolts and weapons without which even gods were helpless; and it says something for the intelligence of early races that, in all lands and from the earliest ages, the artificer was so honored, though like all Saviors he was rejected for a time, and like poor lame Vulcan, cast out of heaven. Alike in India, Syria and Egypt, artificers—carpenters and sons of carpenters, have been the not unnatural instruments for the redemption of man, or rather for the elevation of the race. It was Visva Karma’s children, the Takshāks of Ophite faith and artificer fame, who first in Northern India started the arts and civilization on which Aryans built, and which made “the sunny Continent” “the Jewel of the Earth,” as shown in its usnal Yoni-form on our map of India, at end of this volume. They too despised their Saviors, and Egypt almost forgets her “Son of God”—Amset, the son of Osiris, who offered himself up as a sacrifice for his people. More probably he was a good prince who, like Budha, spared not his own life in trying to better his race.2 When during these researches we found. both ancient and modem authors thus writing regarding these archaic races, when they so unanimously asserted that Aithiops were not only the first to establish settled governments, fixed laws and 1 Takshaks, mean “Carpenters” in Sanskrit. 2 See parallel columns Helios, our Appendix iv.

Folly of too Prudish or Veiled Writing. 507polity but, as Stephanus of Byzantium says, “were the first to excogitate a religion and the worship of the Gods,” then it becomes an imperative part of our self-imposed task to investigate closely and at length, everything concerning them and their times, and so pourtray as far us possible their ancient faith, its gods and symbols. It has been our misfortune to find here, as at the roots of all faiths, subjects and objects which most writers would conceal; but it is impossible for a thorough and truthful investi-gator to do this. Many have purposely or in ignorance too long misled the multitude, induding both historians and theologians, and the result is grievous; for there have in conseqnence thus arisen thousands of learned writings, extending back to the Gnostik era, full of fake theories, abstruse and worthless conclusions. Pious men have laboriously examined the old faiths and rites, determined to find for everything, high and spiritual reasons where none such existed, and when probing deep, they have occasionally been arrested by matter either too gross to comprehend or to discuss. The temples were there, they exclaimed, but “where are the Gods?” for they could not recognize them; and the ordinary mass of writern, not being original investigators, naturally passed over with little attention what former ones had deigned only to notice in footnotes or in quotations, variously veiled in a foreign tongue. Thus have most writers, and consequently readers, usually missed the most important and real facts of the case—the very god of the faith they were investigating, so that their whole themes, the pictures and their settings, are warped and worthless. Darkness has too often been described as light, and evil things allegorised or spiritualised into the semblance of good; and simple and uninquiring masses asked to drink water flowing from the most polluted sources, as if it came from crystal founts, and to accept a religion based, both historically and ethically, on a false foundation, nay to worship gods connected in their origin with all that we ought to avoid. Thus ancient history has to be rewritten, and religious history must be entirely so, down to Reformation times; yet we blame only those few teachers who knew or suspected the truth, and who from interested motives, or to uphold their own faiths rather than truth, hid or veiled their knowledea in spiritual verbiage or a foreign tongue, so that readers though seeing and hearing might not understand. We are all creatures of our circumstances, and the ancients saw no coarseness in those things which which offend our sense of propriety. Only gradually did men rise from objective to subjective worship; from the organ or its coarse symbols to the spiritual idea. So did Israel of old, so too have the educated Aryan and Drâvidian of Bănāres and Madras risen abovc the coarse object worship of their uneducated ancestors, and their own surroundings. As geographical circumstances materially affect a race, so do they also its religion, and this both in fervor and form. The highlanders of Armenia and the Girghis of the Asiatik steppes, the wanderers in the arid deserts of Africa and Arabia, and the dwellers on the shores and ilets of these continents were all developed religiously and otherwise by their surroundings. These differentiated their wishes, "},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c. Eastern Aborigines. 508hopes and fears, and modes of exhibiting these, from other races not so situated. The dwellers on the dry deserts had to content themselves by throwing up a karn of mere loose stones, or by erecting an ovicular or obeliskal one as symbol of their god-idea; but the civilised Aithiop of the Nile had no stone to waste, so he carefully planned his karns or pyramids and obelisks, and shaped these out in the quarry to erect beside his centers of civilization. On the other hand the agriculturist of the delta of the Euphrates collected, formed and baked his muddy soil, and reared it into huge mounds, cementing it with bitumen that it might withstand his humid clime. With other races the tree where obtainable, sufficed for karn and obelisk, temple or hallowed circle; and natural forms approaching in appearance to the organik were esteemed more sacred than any which man could form. So again the rude nomad who subsisted on his flocks and herds, fearing the fierce heat of Surya, loved best soft Luna and all her starry host; and though acknowledging the sacred fires of passion which gave increase to him and his, yet Agni was no god to him such as he was to the dweller on the cold wet heights of Kaukasian lrans amidst Kabiri or G’ebrs. Our god or gods change with our wants and aspirations, and become material to the materialist, be he nomad or philosopher, but always the most wished for or highest object or idea we can excogitate. Yet as we develope, we pass by or cast away our ideals, though never without a struggle more or less severe. Let us now consider some of the offshoots of the great early colonizers. PHENICIANS or PHOINIKES.—Phenicians and their congeners the Kanā-ans, Ch’nans, &c., as these were called by their neighbors and possibly among themselves, were undoubtedly one of the mixed Aithiop peoples, or remnants of early Turano races, who so long dominated Western Asia. and held all Syria, well down into Greek days. There are many explanations given of their names to which we must give attention as these generally point to Gods or Faiths, and it will assist the ordinary reader very much in clearing up what appears to him complex, and simplify our enquiry, by avoiding for the present such affixes as various languages add to form plurals, as oi, i, ites, and ia or ian, “land of;” stine, “place,” &c.; and instead of Phenicians or rather Phoinikians write simply Phoiniks; instead of Hiv-ites, Hivs; and for Hittites, Hits or Chits, the h being guttural. It has been urged that Kanaan was the name of the great ancestor of the Phoiniks; that Chna is but a contraction of the oriental form of Phoinik, and Sanchoniathon (the Phoinik) says that it was so changed in his day. Kanān was a common name for the Phoiniks in Syria when Greeks ruled there, and according to Herodotos was with Greeks merely a contracted form of Asyria. Some Hebrews said that k-n-a, or o-n, came from an obsolete root k-n-o, signifying “depressed,” because Hebrews principally knew Kanāns as living in the the low coast lands. Greek similarly guessed at the origin of Phoiniks, believing it came from Phoinix a palm, because these trees were there plentiful, especially in the country of "},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Effects of Climate on Faith Developments. Phoinikes. 509the Anaks or Southem Phoiniks and Amal-eks; that is, in the southem lauds of the Paleshts, or what we call Southern Palesh-tine or Philistinia, for both these words come from the ancient Palasht. Now one of the most important “Nations” which the Jews came across, about 1500 B.C., were the “Giant Enims”1 or Beni Anaks—“Sons of Anak,” who lived like “the great builders” (which they too were) in walled cities and around Hebron, but their strongholds lay along the coosts and far away and beyond Kanáan. It was to these Beni-Anaks that Greeks gave the name of Pheni-Anaks, and in time Pheniks or Phienix. Pausanias speaks of them at Corinth and Miletus as “the important Anak-torii;” Manetho as the Ph’Anakes, and throughout the Mediteranean States they were Foinikej, Ph’Anax or P’Anaks, &c., and fame for valor and skill in arts and architecture. They stood in such high repute, says Faber, that an Anak came to mean with Gentiles “a king,”2 and Bakchus was called pre-eminently the Ph-anak, or the god or oracle of Anaks. Their lineage was traced nack to the Dios-kuri, Sun-gods, or children of an ancient Zeus, and the worship of their ancestors spread, says Pausanias, over Greece, Sicily and Italy as Theoi Soteres or “Divine Saviors.” It was a title of honour to be called an Anak. To Anakes belonged the sacred city of Hebron, and Jehovah called them “a people, great, many and tall—giant Zuzim or Zamzummim, Mans or Amons.”3 These were all of the Phoinik or Kuklopo-Titan race, once “Libyan shepherds” according to the Odyssey’ “miners and great builders” said Herodotos “and “forgers of the bolts of Zeus” wrote Hesiod. From their lineage did “the chosen people” glady take “their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods,”4 and, “forgetting their own Ale-im,” or Al-gods, worshipped the similar but more ancient Baal and Asherah or sylvan Pārvati of the Aithiopian races. Throughout Greece the Anaktes were identified with Zeus, and presided over the national games, arts, poetry, music and all matters of culture as well as war. The very festivals came to be enlled Anakeia, and the Phoiniks themselves to be identified with the gods in all points mental and bodily. The Is-Ra-Els metaphorically and not without reason called themselves “pigmies” beside them; for these poor “Arabian Saturnites” had not even in the early days of David a village smithy or artizan, or a weapon of war or defence. They even had to beseech the Beni-Anakes to sharpen their agricultural implements.5 No wonder they spoke of the Phoiniks with respect and some terror, calling them Rephas, Nephils, &c., and saying that they sprang from the soms of their Gods or the Ale-im, who had visited their daughters. They were thought to be the Rā-ama—“Sons of Cush,” that is the Bar-chus of Genesis x. 7, and the Bakchus of Aryans whom Ptolemy called Rephmas. So Indian Rama-ites claimed, as we have said, to be Kusis, because Rāma, as an Avatār, was the child of Kus-alya, was born in the land of Kus-ala, lived by the river Kusi, and after ascendning bodily 1 Josh. xi. 22, xv. 14; Num. xiii. 28; Deut. ii. 10. 2 Cabiri, II. 212. 3 Deut. ii. 19-21. 4 Judg. iii.

According to the writer of Genesis, the Ph’Anakes were Canāans, descendants of Kush, and as old as the Egyptian or Mitz-Ras, and came like Abraham from the East, but long after the Palasht tribes. There also was their first Tyr or Tyre, and from it and Gerha (on the coast adjoining their western cradle or the iland of Bahrein) they had regularly formed caravan routes to Syria and Egypt by Petra, &c. Even in our 5th century the Himyars of S. W. Arabia, as well as the Babylonians, were called Aithiops, Kutha and Phoiniks, claiming in some instances “Nimrod, son of Cush,” as their great patriarch. Susa was “the seat of the Aithiopian Memnon,” and Susa and Elam were peopled both from central Asia and Arabia. The Old Testament does not help us here, for as the Rev. Mr Kenrick points out,1 according to one part of Genesis the Noachian race are left on high Armenia, but in another they travel from the East to the Babylonian plains, which agrees with most Eastern history, but distinctly contradicts the idea of the first race spreading from a western Eden, a matter we have already touched on in connection with Meru. Gradually the great Turan peoples had to yield to the pressure of Shemites on their south and east, and to Aryans or races akin to themselves intermixed with Aryans on their north; until finally the pure breeds disappeared under a multitude of names, or were absorbed, forming more or less divargent Aryanized or Shemitized peoples. In the north they closely intermingled with Pelasgi, and in Syro-Phoinikia with all those tribes the Old Testament writers speak of as Hivites, Perizites, Hits, Cheths or Kheti; and whom the Ramsides of the 13th century B.C. caIled “a Tartar-like race with shaven heads and one lock of hair.” These were clearly from an early stock which had left Chinese Tartary, and worked their way as later Aryans did, through Baktria or Kaukasia, here to foregather with others of their race who had passed by more southerly routes. All had planted strong kingdoms as they went forth from Eastern Manchura, as in India and its coasts, and onwards into Kaldia, Arabia and Egypt. Thus then light is thrown upon many historical statements and legends, and especially the Ezra-itik genealogies of Genesis. According to Ezra and his compilers of probably the 5th century B.C., there were eleven Kanāan tribes, of whom the great body must have come upon the field of history through the Eruthri of the two Eruthrean Seas; by which is meant the ocenas even to far east Chersonese, and certainly those around Taprobane (Ceylon) and the Indian Colca or Colchis. It is stated that the children of Kanāan are, 1st Sidon; 2nd Heth, or Cheth, the Khitæ of Syria, and no doubt the earlier Khita of Mongolia, China and Manchuria; 3rd, Jehush; 4th, Amori or Hamri—“Hill men”?; 5th, Girgashi; 6th, Hiv, Hivi or Chui—“villagers” and worshippers of phalik Baal Berith; 7th, Ar-ki, or Horki, or Ornki; 8th, Sin, the Chini, Tsini or Zins, names familiar to Ptolemy as the 1 Phenicia, chap. iii., and xi. 2."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Kanāan’s Ten Sons.

Their capital, the present Hamah on the Orontes, was said to be situated in “the garden of Syria,” and we still look to it for important archeological remains, for the H m t s were evidently as civilised a people as the Asyrians and vastly older. We shall by and bye give them special attention. India seems to have been the cradle in which grew to civilization those large portions of the race, who as Eruthri came by sea to Kaldia, Arabia, and probably Egypt; though Egyptians, we think, were an earlier stream, which pierced south through Kaukasia to the Nile whe.n the Indian Eruthri were passing south through Tibet or the Hindu Kush to the valleys of the Ganges. These last seem only to have got their name, Eruthri, upon reaching the western shores of India, when we find them calling all the seas they then saw, after their God, leader or “great ancestor” Eruthrus; “whose tomb,” said old historians, “you will meet on the isle of Oguris, as you sail onwards towards Karmania’s Cape.1” Of course in all lands they had special or local names among which from its signification, Ebræi or Hebros was naturally a common one. This name they carried on into Spain as Ebri, or Iberi, or Iberians. Many of the cities of the ancient world seem called after them, as the capital of Lusitania—our Portugal, Ebora of Gades or Iberian Tur-detania, and many towns and districts in Gaul. The very ancient city of York was Ebor-acum, and Ebro is everwhere a common river term.2 The name of their Moabite capital, Bosra, they continued in their African capital. In the furthest West, as in the East, they are described as a people, “ruddy, dusky, tall, noble, valiant, learned in-genious, and divine or devilish,” according to the way they treated the inferior peoples they came across. Egyptians and Mediteraneans looked upon Phoinik, Phoinix, Poinicus or Punicus as honoumblo nmnes, but the Phenician peoples simply accepted the names of the localities they dwelt in, as Sidonians, Tyrians. &c. The Greeks of Homer’s time and earlier, called their phalik Dio-nusos, Ph’Anak; and their Mysian brethren gave this name to their Bakchos, which poets made Ph’Anes, Ph’aion, Fanum, &c.; understanding by Ph’ or Pi, something “divine or holy,” from its Egyptian meaning as the mouth of a god, the oracle, essence or power of whatever it is affixed to; indeed Di is but the later for, of Pi, as in Di-An, Pi-Ades, Dio-nus, &c. The Hyksos and Am-Elki were by sone called Phoiniki, and all such peoples invariably worshipped, when possible, on high hills, ilands or Nusæ, and name very commonly used by these old races, and probably corresponding to the Yahud Nesi—ysn, the Yad, dy, or “Hand”-god of Jews,3 to whom Moses raised his hand to 1 Strabo, under these names; and Bryant’s Myth., III. 185-191. 2 See Holwell’s Myth Dict., p. 170. 3 The “Hand” is Siva, see fig. 222, p. 139, and Saul and Absalom’s “Hands,” I Sa. xv. 12, II.

For this and other reasons we see that Yahuê, Bâal and Dio-nusos were clearly the same solo-phalik god under different tribal names. Even our present translation of the Old Testament shows that the names. Jahveh and Bâal are thorought interchangeable, but this will be fully dwelt on elsewhere. Belus whether seen in the Sun or in his earthly emblem the Lingam, Palm tree, Stelê or Pillar, was called a Phoinix, and everything pertaining to him was noble, and hence also, owing to this name signifying red or scarlet, these colors came to be worn. as a mark of royalty or nobility. The Palm was the Sun-god’s tree, and an elegant and suggestive natural symbol, which is a better reason for its being a Phoinix than because it largely grew in Syro-Phenicia. The Jews clearly appreciated its phalik symbolism, for they used it in all sexual and solar rites as at nuptial fetes; and Chris-tians not only in this followed them and other phalik worahippers, but intensified the idea by occasionally hanging their phalik Alpha and Omega on this sacred tree, which they then formed into a cross as here seen. Lingam-loving Ceylon is said to be termed Langa or Lanka, as “Queen of Palm Tree Iles,” after the Langala, or Langalala, which signi-fies a “Palm tree, Phalus or Tail.” In fact we probably here see a mere form of the word Lingam as “the tail, root, essence,” &c.—all terms applicable to Siva, Immor- tality, and to the immortal Phœnix bird, one of his em-blems. Like him it often slumbers, said legend, and revives on the altar of the Sun (high Kailâsa), springing into fresh life and vigor, again to quicken nature. The term Anak came to signify nobility among Hebrews, who called the Anaks, Sarim. The Plshts descended, according to Gen. x., through the Mitz-Ra-im of some 3000 B.C., by Ptrs or Pathrusim and Kushlu-im, to the Kptrs or Kaphtor-im of Zoan or Tanes; where on an inscription they are called “Kefts.” They freely sacrificed human beings, and made exquisitte pottery (Keft-ware) on their sacred ile of Kaftor.3 Their descendants are the present Kofts—the Greek Gupts in our name “Egypt” or Ai-gupts—the “land of Kupts.” The Vulture or Ai-gupios-idea is as absurd as the palm tree one, though we can imagine how it arose. 1 The “Hand” as Man’s peculiar “Weapon,” is still raised in invocation or blessing; and a “Hand” crowned the phalik tower of Babel; see our fig. 205 on p. 71.

Rice and Early Influence of Phoinakes. 513Old Testament writers identify the Philistines, or Palashts, with Kaptrs,—the Egyptian Kbts, and describe them as great and world-wide rulers.1 Egypt drove out numbers in 1200 B.C., and so laid the foundation of Karian, Kreté, and probably Grecian prosperity. But 1200 was a Cyclic period when the hand of Creation’s clock was commanding the nations to move onwards and to the west as usual; and Phenicians obeyed, but still, as ever and everywhere, carried on their busy trading in gems, ivory, gold, dyes, pottery, and every manufacture which required ingenuity, skill and talent. They continued to impress the world with their energy and talents no less than with their learning, religion and arts. The hero of the Kaldian epic was no other, says Prof. Sayce, than their Tyrian Melkarth, from whom Greeks got their Herakles, and Jews and others their Samsons or strong solar heroes. These Aithiopes were the life-blood of the ancient world, and their withdrawal from a land was a sure mark of its decay. When by 1400 B.C. they had forsaken Kaldia, its descent com-enced, and with their westward move to Asyria, that nation arose; and after it the western kingdoms, which Aithiopes too stirred into life. It was they who taught the early Aryan Pelasgi, Ionians, Doreans, Thebans, Boiōtians and Achaians, who taught Orpheans; and but for Kuthite arts and literature, Thessalians and other Greeks, would have remained the robbers and pirates which Phenicians found them, down to the rise of the Latin races—their pupils also. Recent linguistic studies, says Prof. Rawlinson, tend to show that a Cushite or Aithiopian race did, in the earliest times, extend itself along the shores of the southern ocean from Abysinia to India. The whole peninsula of India was peoplcd by a race of this character before the influx of the Aryans. They extended along the sea-coast through modern Beluchistān, and Kerman; and cities on the northern shores of the Persian Gulf are shown to have belonged to this race by the brick inscriptions found in their rivers. Prof. Benfey and others write to the same effect,2 and we will give more evidence further on, for they were the later Saba-s, Sama-s or Sham-ites. Western historians continually speak of a far off Aithiopian land and a sacred iland on the distant Mare Eruthreum, also of the first Tur, Tsur, Tyre, Tylon or Tiloun of Ernthri; and the Babylonian tablets identify these with Bahrein, the holy ilet of Aradus, and its adjacent colony on the mainland. From this locality, says Dr. Oppert, came the principal deities of the Asyrian Pantheon, as well as those monsters who, Kaldians said taught men the arts and sciences.3 Important results may yet be looked for by judicious excavations on the numerous tumuIi of Bahrein, or Tyrine, and the adjacent coast sites of the cities of Milukh, Magan and, Agir, or of Gerha, Ophir and Ojeir, as these are now called. Here as in the West, these Turano-Phoiniki are found to have constructed fine Kuklopean masonry now buried in mounds, con- 1 Smith’s Bib.

Rawlinson,1 as he, an inhabitant of Thasos, a Greko-Phenician colony? It was here that Quintius Curtius and others placed the tomb of Eruthras, their patriarchal demi-god after whom not only the two great inland seas but all Indian oceans were named. Greeks called Herakles, Eruthras, apparently owing to his having a temple at Eruthra in Achaia, where he is shown as god of ships or sailors, sitting on a raft, and suggegtively drawn on shore by a cable made from the hair of Eruthrean women. The wife of Herakles is here called Erutha, and a legend says that Erutheus obliged the Grecian Herakles to bring back the cows of Geryon from the Iberian coast;2 so that Eruthrus evidently became a term for a solar god, although probably at first only the honored patriarch of Aithiops, who rose, they said, in the sunny East, and who was the Noah of the earliest sea-borne civilizers of the dark West. Babylonians “admitted having received all their knowledge from the mysterious ilanders of the Persian Gulf.” Oanes they called their “Saviour, Fish-god or the Ichthus who came from the midst of the Eruthræan Sea,” and taught all the inhabitants of the Tigris and Euphrates, “letters, sciences and arts of every kind.” He is termed “the creator of mankind,” “the God of Knowledge,” and “Lord of Erid, Suripak and Khalka, Karak and Arakia, that islet which lies off the mouth of the Euphrates.” He was “the Lord of the house of water”—the Absu, or Abyss; meaning the deep seas said to be under the earth (in Hebrew phraseology), but here merely signifying the base of the Babylonian land system, as Sir H. Rawlinson justly explains. Sir Henry shows that Hea was Niduk-ki, a form of the Sun-god, and of “Izdubar,” or “An-dubar, the Indian,” who developed into a Hermetik Nebo; and Nebo was the inventor of letters corresponding to Toth and Hermes, whom Babylonians called I r m i s , and said was the “deity of their Temple Towers.” Just as in Egypt all learning was written on the obelisks and temples, so in the days of writing, all Kaldian records were deposited in these Hermetik towers. The Asyrians called the Akadian Niduk-ki, Til-mun, which is held to be “the high Mun,” or probably “High Amun God,” for it seemathat the earliest colonizers first seized the Nile valley, and, then developed into civilized Amuns, Sethi, Osiri, &c., and that only after they had become strong and learned did they send forth, as Diodorus relates, “a colony to Babylon under Belus son of Neptune,” whom Babylonians would call Merodach, son of Hea. It was these Bels or Bâlis who first “established and consecrated the learned priests called Kaldus (a name their Armenian brethren also used), teaching them to observe the stars, as did the priests and astrologers of Egypt.” Oanes the Eruthrean or Aithiop had a very Egyptian-like name in Mus-ar or Mus-ra, probably Mitz-ra and the later solar Mith-Ra.7 1 R.

Their Vishnu and Lakshmi. 515The Paschal Chronicle relates that the first teacher of Babylonian astrology was An-du-barius, an Indian, the Iz-du-bar of Asyrians, and his name, according to Sir H. Rawlinson, may mean Thubar, “the Palm Tree Wood-God,” and “the personation of the Sun as Lord of Fertility”—nevertheless here evidently only a wooden Lingam. Niduk-ki is mythically called “The great Mountain of Bel or Bôl,” with a mysterious bull or fertilizing agency, precisely similar to the Indian idea of Siva; for he too was a Bull and Mountain God who sat on high Kailāsa, “with his mountain goddess, Pār-vati, pouring forth sperm upon earth.” Vishnu throned on his high Lotus, churning earth and ocean into fertility with his so-called Mandar or mountain pestle, is such another idea (cf. Glossary, Vishnu). On the Persian Gulf, these early Turani or pristine Aithiops called their Mercury, I n z a k , and his wife was the Babylonian Venus, Tasmit, and according to the inscriptions L a k h - a mu n or L a k h m u, who became identified with Ziru-panit, the wife of the Apolo, Merodach, and of Nebo as Pap-nun or “Mother Fish.” This is most important, as it points to an Eruthrean origin of the Western Hermes and our Eastern Lakshmi—the wife of solar Vishnu, who received. her from the ocean. Thus these early Turans not only gave religions and arts to all Aryan peoples but to Egyptians, and through the ancestors of Chits, or “Tartar-like Khetæ,” to all western Chinese. The Aithiopo-Phoiniks or Phoiniki appear to Sir H. Rawlinson to have been an Indian people. They are described as a dusky race, worshipping the sea god Neptune, for Nearchus says he found an island of Neptune or of Hea or Oanes worshippers, in the Indian Ocean. They also appear to have developed the Krishnaik or “dusky-hued gods” and “the ruddy-white deities” of the Sivaite or Etruskan sects; for Eruthras, their demi-god of Bahrein, is called the red or ruddy god, and Inzak or Mercury; and the later Nebo, “a dusky-brown deity.” It is clear that the early settlers at Tylus and Aradus, pushed westwards after colonizing various portions of Arabia and outlying Egypt, and then N.-W. through Babylonia, and finally built Tsur and Arvad or Arud in Western Phenicia. Sir Henry Rawlinson justly holds “that the entire line of immigration may be traced, by following the records of local worship;” a very important conclusion, long ago insisted on by us throughout this work. Indeed this rule is true inversely, viz., that by tracing worships, rites, and gods, we can also detect races, for the ancient world knew only of the gods and faiths of their ancestors and deviated not from any old customs or rites. Reason could only be exercised within caste limits, as the Fathers of our churches even in these days (but in vain) try to impress on their converts and all teachers of their faith. The poet Dionysius knew much of these early Phoinikes or Indo-Kuths which have been ignorantly put aside, though Bryant, Vallancey and others have long and persis-tently directed the attention of historians thereto.1 A poet wrote many ages ago, that “ Upon the banks of the great river Ind The Southern Skuthæ dwell; which river pays 1 Dion.

The learned poet had no doubt as to the race and their localities. He sees these Eruthreans on the Nile as well as the Indus; and on the Syrian coasts when expelled from the former, under such names as Kadmians, Belidæ or Bâl-ites and Phenicians— “ Upon the Syrian sea the people live Who stile themselves Phoinikes. These are sprung From the true ancient Eruthrean stock. From that sage race, who first assay’d the deep, And wafted merchandise to coasts unknown.” These then were the old Turano-Kusdim or Cusites, Elamites, Auritæ or Ellenes, &c., of Babylon; whose learning and letters, as Josephus told the Greeks,1 they ignorantly imagined had pertained to their ancestors as Hellenes, a name they merely inherited with their solo-phalik faith in Helios or Eilias. “To the West,” as by Egypt, wrote Dionysius, “ The Oritæ live and Aribes; and then The Ara-cotii fam’d for linen gear.” . . . And soma of these were no doubt the Egyptians who described their D delta-like land as a “heart or pear,” the Ath or Ait-rib which others made Errif and Al-ribh. With Egyptians, the Heart, Phalus and euphemistic “Foot,”2 were identical emblems, for Mest in Egyptian signifies both the “Foot” and phalus, and Mata, Egyptian, is alike “Phalus and Heart,” and so is Mata or Mantha in Sanskrit. See these words in our Indexes. The early deified man, “Toth, the son or follower of Mitz-Ra or Mis-Or, was a Phenician,” of the Turano-Aithiops.3 We must beware of a confusion here between later High Asian-Aryan Skyths, and Turan, and Shemitik Cuths or Aithio-pians, who long, and everywhere preceded Aryans, making us indeed hesitate as to the wisdom of a too early philological division of tongues. Many Tartar-like races came and went, like the Syrian Chithi or Hita, in those far back days.

Pausanias, who describes the silk-worm and manufacture of silk, says that Seria was an iland (perhaps a port) on a river in a recess of the Eruthrean Sea, most likely at the mouth of the Indus1 or Narbada, for there is he saying how these great carriers of the ancient world then moved, depending as they did on the peacefulness of the peoples among whom they traded or on their power of controlling them. 7It was clearly owing to Aithiopian skill, energy and trade-routes, that ancient Arabia developed in the wonderful manner it did from its Southern Indian angle. Here Eruthrean wealth and commerce first touched it, and here in consequence, it bounded into “Arabia, the Happy,” the prosperous and populous mother of nations; and precisely as that trade pulsated and changed its course, so Arabia rose and fell in wealth, power and importance, as well as in spawning force. At first the trade appears to have coasted along the northerly boundary of the Eruthrean sea until it reached the Arabian headlands, but from thence the uncertain and frail ocean craft was exchanged for “the Ship of the Desert.” Heeren says this primitive people monopolized the whole carrying trade of the Indian Ocean, from the earliest times up to the days of the Ptolemies, or say 270 B.C., when Egypt determined to share in “this lucrative Sabean traffic, and to be no longer entirely dependent upon Himyars for all the oriental luxuries which had become the necessaries of the people. It was Sabeans who developed alike the coast trade of India, Arabia and Egypt. Wherever they made their depots, they quickened as if by magic, those parts of the dead or inert continents. At first their Eastern merchandize was transported by land up through the whole length or breadth of Arabia, from which it passed by other or their own half-bred races into Western Asia, and the Mediteranean states. Thus towns and even cities grew up at the depots and halting places, or at every 15 to 30 miles, where their immense herds of pack animals had to rest. Some twenty thouaand camels are mentioned as often passing through and halting for a day or two at the different Makāms; and these of course necessitated quite an army of lords and menials with ample markets, granaries and caravansaries, middlemen and traders, and supplies of all descriptions; not to speak of wells, gardens and the cultivation necessary for the sustenance of both men and animals. The effect on Arabia of this continual passing to and fro of huge droves of pack animals, browsing everywhere far and wide over the plains and sparsely wooded hill-sides in search of forage, as is the habit of these destroyen of woodlands, was most disastrous to the growth of all trees, and in time even limited the rainfall, and thus dried up the rivers and water sources of the country. It is this system, continued dur-ing many centuries without any attempt at forest preservation, which has left “Arabia 1 Cf. Collect.

The freights had to be sold at once, or handed over to resident traders or middlemen, or stored away securely—we may be sure under armed retainers—to await more favourable northern tariffs. Thus would all the energy and resource of a clever poople become fully developed and act and react on the great continent and all its surroundings and inter-dependent races. In time, however, the growth of marine enterprise, which had found itself only equal to the coasting trade as far as the Oman seaboard,gradually extended up the Perasian Gulf till it centred in the capacious bay and fine harbour of Bahrein. And here the mariners found protection for their goods; such as they could not obtain amid the marauders of the deserts, who not only by extortion would eat up their profits but no doubt would often plunder and murder their people. In this way would the numerous and important ancient towns we have mentioned, spring up on the coasts around the great gulf, and from hence therefore, did new caravan routes diverge to the West and North, causing a fresh growth of depots, towns and even cities, and giving occupation to many of the busy purveyors of the southern em-poriums, who could no there longer gain a livelihood, or at least the luxuries to which they had been accustomed. Thus were the old seats of trade in Oman and Al-Yemen abandoned to the desert sands, which very soon efface the ephemeral dwellings of an Eastem city. This we conceive to be the reason why we so often notice many pretentious sounding names of evident Yemen and Sabean origin, attached to weird-looking desert mounds or dreary vales, which “ Far as the eye can sweep around Are now but desert, desolate and gray.” The same move northward, but far later, followed the same advance of marine power on the Red Sea, causing the full of Hadramāt, Sanā, or Mareb (the head quarters of southern Sabeans), Tayef, Medina, and all the Hejaz and their immense southern populations, which this trade had then developed, and then left idle and starving. Gradually and irresistibly the trade waves moved on northwards, and effected large and important displacements of various Turanian peoples who inhabited all Arabi-Irak, Babylonia, Syria, Arabia-Petrea and all the coasts of Egypt. The movements of the Hyksos which drove the early settlers up the Nile Valley, the Jewish Arabians into Syria, and which eventually, about the 17th century B.C., led to the entire population of Western Asia becoming Shemitik, seem all more or less due to Arabian trade develop-ments and the changes these induced. Nay, the very climate would be affected; for great and sudden increases of prosperity and population, especially by fluctuating multi-tudes whose demands on the woods, water and herbage were urgent and excessive, led to the direct denudation of the land, and therefore to the permanent injury of the "},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Fall of Arabian Trade and Cities.

The author of Pre-historic Nations thinks that the Kushite populations of Arabi-Irâk here consolidated themselves (not necessarily for the first time), between 3500 and 3000 B.C., probably under a celebrated but somewhat mythical ruler Zohak, and that it was this empire which Arabians and Shemites broke up and finally wiped out. The Himyars and Sabeans arc thought to have been named after two great chiefs of Southern Arabia, who in vastly distant times introduced the primitive worship of phalik emblems, as stones, karns, &c., and then of solar, or as we understand this, Sabean worship. Saba is often translated “god,” meaning the sun-god, Sa-Aba or Father Sar, he who dwelt in the sun. Sabeans called their king’s palace Rā-i-dan or “the place of the sun-god,”1 which would be a suitable Egyptian name, and confirma-tory of our argument, that Aithiops founded the religion and civilization of the Nile. All Arabia persistently held to their old solo-phalik faith down to our 7th century, nor is it by any means yet effaced in Southern Arabia.2 Himyar was, says the Arabian historian Alkandi, a king who flourished about 1430 B.C., and whose dynasty lasted till destroyed by Abysinian invasion in our 4th or 5th century.3 It was of course owing to the wide travelling, energetic trading, and the varied knowledge, wit and genius these developed, that we find various astonished stay-at-home people ascribing god-like wisdom, bravery, gigantic stature, divine mien and power to Aithiops or their cognate tribes;4 for wealth, enterprize, administrative skill, a knowledge of and consideration for divers religions—all the result of extensive travel and trade—were in those days the only educators, and led then, as they do still, to the breaking up of caste rules and all dogmatic ideas concerning the present and a future life. All this agitated and unhinged slumbering nations; and forced upon them the consideration of, and consequently a choice between, opposing creeds and ideas, which never occurred to them so long as they fancied that their own little iland or tribal home was all the gods cared for and all the world was made for. The faith of the great Sabean and Phenician race in their gods, rites and mythology, also impressed all favour-ably and took therefore fast hold upon them, remaining long after the races of Chams, Kuths, Chiti or Phenicians had passed onwards; all the more so from the fact, that the energetic traders were as earnest in their religion, as in their commerce and arts. Their towers and shrines were to be seen in every port where they tarried, and along every coast and river as well as hill top and oasis. To talk therefore of them and theirs as barbarous or illiterate, is absurd. Their trade extending over vast areas and to far distant depots and cities, necessitated the usual literature of commerce, such as we are now finding beneath the ruins of Babylonia and Asyria, and which we may yet hope to find everywhere beneath their innumerable Arabian tumuli and the sands which have there 1 Bib Arch.

Aryan and Shemitik writers have too long accustomed us to look upon this far back Turanian civilization with contempt. Phoiniks and their allied peoples, though the worthy heirs of Aithiops, Akads and other Kushites, have been represented to us as mere sailors or clever coast tribes, instead of the skirmishing forces of great powerful and civilized nations—the possessors of a fixed and more cultivated literature and faith than Jews or even Greeks possessed till a few centuires before our era. Long before Joshua and his barbarian army sacked (it is said in the 15th century) the sacred town of Debir, that city of Aithiop priests was one well known as “a city of books” or Karith-Sapr—this when Jews even confess that they only scratched characters on “plastered stones.” Herodotos, who never apparently heard of Jews, relates that Western Asia was them ruled by Phoiniks, Palaistines and others, brethren to those who had built Tyre and its solar temple. M. Renan was, it seems, startled at “the singular relations existing between the ethnographic, historic and linguistic positions of Yemen and Phenicia;” whilst Sir H. Rawlinson finds that “Hamites or Cushites preceded Shemitic and Aryan civilization throughout that whole region” of Western Asia; and that “the primeval Canaanites were indeed of the race of Ham, and no doubt originally spoke a dialect closely akin to the Egyptian.” He too sees in Phenicians and Canaanites an Aithiopian or Hamite race who migrated there “long anterior to Abraham,” accepting the statement of Herodotos that they founded Tyre about 2760 B.C. All this corroborates what we elsewhere learn as to Kepheus and his Syro-Aithiopian kingdom, ruling from Hebron, with a seaport at Jopa, Jafa or I-opa.1 “Where,” asked Ephoros, “did this people not go?” they ruled all the coasts of both Asia and Africa—that is, all the known world. They were primarily neither Shemites nor Aryans but the leaders and formers of these, giving to them body and consistency, art, faith, legends and mythologies, too commonly thought to be distinctively Aryan or Shemitik. After covering Babylonia and Egypt with buildings as ensamples to Shemites, they became also the in-structors of Aryanized Dorians, Syrians, Ionians, Karians and all Greek races through-out Asia Minor, Phenicia and the Meditaranean states; and left magnificent speci-mens of both masonry and sculpture in Palmyra, Bâlbek, and “the daughters of Arvad,” with pillars and obelisks everywhere, such as Aryans said only giants could have con-ceived and constructed. At least 2000 years B.C. they had sculptured theatres along this coast out of the solid rock, having a semi-diameter of 700 feet; and raised to great heights and beantifully fitted into fine buildings, blocks of stone 28 by 16 by 16 feet. That was a day which historians have called one of “quiet Arvadite civilization,” when “the daughters of Arvad compassed such Kuklopian cities, as Paltus, Karne, Enhydra Marthus and Martu,” their M’rith or Amrit, “a name found,” says Sir H. Rawlinson, “in the oldest inscriptions of Ur, in connection with its most primitive kings, and applied by Hamitic Kaldians to Phenicians.”2 All these names are of course 1 Pre-historic Nations, pp. 132-134. 2 Ibid., pp. 143, 185, 219."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"The Sabean Builders of Martu become Sam-as, or Shemites. 521divine, that is, relate to the gods of this highly religious race; and all have continued to be sacred among Aryans and Shemites from the solar shrine of Martand in Kashmēr to similar remains in the near West. Mr. Kenrick, one of those historians to whom our remarks unfortunately apply as to writing without a knowledge of the only key which can unlock ancient religious art and history, describes “the Phenician remains at Martu and Aradus,1 as a number of structures with square bases, round shafts with round or pointed summits, which had probably some distinct connection with the ancient religion of Phenicia,” but how religion is connected with “shafts” the “Historian” throwns no light throughout his two volumes! Thus is the very raison d’être of the whole subject lost to every ordinary student, though not we trust to any of our readers who have studied the figures which appear on the square altars and poles of Kaldia, Asyria, &c., noted in the margin.2 “The daughters of Arvad” may be further expected to give birth to many children of a like kind, denoting a past civilization. superior to that which bowed down before their first rude M u d r o s , the unshapely Paphian Ken and other obscene Venuses. As the race had initiated and taught arts and civilization in the West, so had their Indian brethren done this among Indian aborigines, and then instructed the intruding Indo Aryans, for when Aryans descended through the Himalayas they found “great cities, well constructed and firm as iron”—works of “Asuras or aborigines,” as the Rig Veda described these some 2000 years B.C. Theirs were the “great towers, high and fortified,” before which the Aryan nomads encamped like the present desert Kalmaks, as we see these with their little black tents before such cities as Balk, Khiva; &c. It took long, as Mr. Fergusson says, to instruct such inapt pupils; for after the Aryan conquest of upper India, the writer of the Mahābhārata, speaking of these times, said the Aryans had to call upon “Māya, the Asura Artificer,” to build a palace for their King Yudhisthira, just as their western inapt Shemite scholars had to call upon their brethren at Tyre to construct a shrine at Jerusalem for their Yahuê. Only in the days of Vedik Upanishads do we hear of any Indo-Aryans studying architecture, but of this we have no specimens till near the Christian era. In a religious point of view there is no difference between Sabis or Sabeans, Samas or Shamites, that is Shemites or Semites, for, as the writer of Genesis states, Kanāans, Misraas or Mitz-Ra-im, and “Phuts,” &c., were all from one stock—all Aithi-opes or Meru-opes with a strong solo-phalik Fire and Serpent cult. They all had Bâal, Nebu and Peor on their high places, Yachaveh or Yahuê, the “Grove” or Asherah and Fire, in their central groves; Berith or Berut and Poseidon on their coasts, and apart from Aithiopian lore, neither etymologically nor otherwise can we unravel this last water god’s name and rites. From Aithiops did later peoples get their Osiris and Isis, Khem and Ken, and all Venuses.

They minted Kuphik and Phoinik coins, and their “tokens” or symbols have been found from the Runik north, to the rock of Hadramât, and from far beyond Iran in the east to our Irene in the west. Mr. Baldwin finds traces of the traders in the Passoe heads and languages of Western Africa and its iland groups—a probable enough result, when we remember that Carthage was once their busy western capital, with a population of nearly three quarters of a million. On every coast they had favourite towns of call, the foreign markets of which entirely depended on Phenician wealth and enterprise.1 When released from the toils and difficulties of their Arabian overland route, the Turans widened their range, pressing forward with increased energy into northern parts; as north-westerly through Syria and Asia Minor to Thrace and all the coasts and ilands of the Mediteranean; and north-easterly through Armenia, Babylonia and Parthea, into Baktria and even into the pathless deserts of Gobi; where at their depots or karavansaries we hear of buildings, apparently tempIes, of massive Kuklop-like masonry, reared doubtless to their Sun-God. Heeren speaks of their commerce all about Balk and north of the Kaukases, the old Colchian home of one of their principal tribes; and Balk was Baal, and like Drâvida famed for Bâal worship. Philologists tell us that the Georgian language is a survival of the speech of their Chitite or Kitite brethren, and as such we find it engraved on the rocks of Bogahz Keui, the Pteria of our Classics; at Eyuk on the banks of the Halys, on their old caravan routes from Sardis to Armenia; as well as near Ghiaour-Kalessi in Phrygia.2 Rawlinson claims for their Hamitik inscriptions on the broken obelisk of Susa a period as remote as 3200 B.C., adding that there is “conclusive evidence” that all civilization entered Babylonia from Aithiopia, or Merukh—the Milukha of Akads, and Arabia through Kusa. Not only do African and Arabian names remind us of these universalists, but travellers are frequently noticing linguistik traces of them in Eastern Persia, Beluchis-tan, Kelat, and all the coasts of Sind and Guzerat; whilst learned Orientalists state that the earliest Pali characters of India bear unmistakeable traces in form and arrange-ment, of ancient Arabik, Armenian and Phenician. This is treated of in a learned manner by the later Professor Dowson3 and other scholars, and will be specially dealt with in a Preface to our Glossary. Signor Gorresio in his remarks on the Ramāyana, long ago insisted (ix. 29) that the early rulers of India were of Hamitik or Aithiopik origin. He says, “the inter-ruption of Daxa’s (Daksha’s) sacrifice was the struggle of the ancient aborigines of India, represented under the mythical veil of Siva . . . . . a deity of the Cush or Hamitik tribes, which preceded on the soil of India, the Arian or Indo-Sanskrit race. 1 Pre-historic Nations, p. 160.  2 Sayce in Soc.

The Aryan colonization, says Dr. Hunter, “was a gradual natural process accom-plished by successive waves of emigrants from the north, . . . . . and a long enough time elapsed (between these) for the aborigines to influence Aryan dialects and Aryan religion, before they were finally driven back from the lowlands.” It was thus very long before the name of the “poor colonist” (Aryan) came to signify “noble,” or any-thing else indeed than a follower of the Ar, Er or Il-God, as pointed out at page 150 and elsewhere. But to return to the Hamites or Phenicians of the West. These continued. to be respected for their culture, wealth and skill, well down into Roman days, and we clearly trace them by their artistic remains until entirely absorbed into the races they lived with and worked for. They maintained active and friendly intercourse with all who required work and not war, who sought the culti-vation of religion and art, and the blessings which follow peace. When driven from Asia Minor and its coasts, they usually fled to their African colonies in and around their old city of Utika; and, about the period alleged for the Trojan war, thither went their beautiful Tyrian princess, Dido and a large following to escape Asiatik oppressors. They settled about Busra, then apparently the port of Utika, and a city 300 years old, calling it Cartha-go or Kartha, after their old tutelary god, M’El-Karth, the Herakles of Tyre. To his shrine they continued annually, even during Roman rule, to send offerings and often a tithe of their revenues.2 We are aware that Mel is usually read “city,” but it is only so, as we have shown in the case of Il or Ilu of Kaldia, because citizens always clustered around their El, AI or Il-God, and he was usually their M’el, Mah, Mih or Mahā El or Maha Deva. Many tribes of the early Phoinikes were called by Egyptians and Asyrians Khars and A’Kharus, and from these Kurs, Kars or solarists, did Mesopotamia probably get its old name of Karasu. See our Glossary and Index on all these solar terms, which enter largely into the geographical names of divers places in Asia.

Isaac Taylor, “scratching out such Phenicio-Greek letters as we see on the leg of the colossus of Abou-sirubel in Nubia.2 Herodotos is thought by many to be the first Greek writer who to any extent used pen and ink on skins and papyrus, but his opening chapter seems to allude to continuous history writing. We know of no Greek writer older than Pisiatratos, of say 550 B.C., nor of any incized inscription on stone or metal older than or perhaps nearly so old as, 700 B.C.; yet Phenician writings of the 9th century are now before us as in the inscription of King Mesa of Moab of 890 B.C., and some are said to belong to the 10th century. But Asia Minor had, says Professor Sayce, about 1500 B.C. a syllabary of seventy characters, some of which Cyprus con-tinued to use long after Greek days,3 and Greeks only began to use these or Kadmian letters, about the beginning of the 8th century, when they were not very distinct to the letters on the Moab stone and to the characters of Thera or Santorin, one of the oldest Phoiuik settlements. It is urged that in those days and parts, the Phoinikes were Shemites; which only means that the old Turans had been Shemitized, and had given to their conquerors an alphabet, language and literature, as well as religion and mythologies, now called Shemitik. They did the same to Aryans and many of other early peoples in the East and West; as to Pelasgi, Skuths, Kelts, Sabines, &c., many of whom may be looked upon as Aryanized Turano-Aithiopes. We see the process going on to-day in India, where thousands of Turans are annually drifting into Shemitik and Aryan pastures. Various writings in Aramaik-Phenician, belonging to periods between the 8th and 6th centuries B.C., have been found scattered abroad over every corner of the wide old Sassanian empire on stones, seals and papyri; whilst sculptured writings, like that on the sarkophagus of Esh-mun-esar, have been met with on most of the ilands and coasts of the Mediteranean. The Kaldi square character appears on some seals and gems belonging to the 5th and 6th centuries B.C., but there is not an instance of the Hebrew square character older than the 2nd or perhaps even the 3rd. century A.C., though Samaritan Hebrew is said to belong to the 3rd century B.C., and the Samaritan alphabet proper to possibly the year 500 A.C.4 Philologists have still a difficult problem in regard to the language of Aithiopians, 1 Lon.

Even if we can define and formulate rules for these tongues—perhaps talked, though not written, some ten thousand years B.C., do not let us imagine we are anywhere near the genesis of man, though near to discoveries which will alter our views thereon, for there were older people than even these archaic Turans; and claims are presently being set up in regard to scratch- ings belonging to aborigines who preceded all Aithiopes—inhabitants of that vast Lemurian continent—which naturalists are pressing upon our notice. Let us now try to trace the history of that portion of the Aithiopik race, which, as Khetu in far East high Asia, and Kheti or Hamaths in Syria, have lately come prominently before us, owing to recent discoveries, and to our better and more general knowledge of the literature of Egypt and adjoining nations. The HAMATHS, KHETA, HIVS and CHETI, ytj.—Until lately these peoples have been quite overlooked, yet they had a very extensive and early civilization. Not only in Western Asia do we hear of them as Kheti or Kheta. but from all the N.-W. shores of the Persian Gulf, where their undoubted mythik patriarch and demi-god Eruthrus, first landed from the East on his colonizing and trading mission. The Aithiopik inscriptions of Meroe, says Brugsch Pasha, “resemble the Aithiopic graffiti on the walls of Philé and other Nubian temples,” and belong to “the pre-Shemitik Sumerian dialect of Southern Babylonia.”1 These Kheta greatly aided Egypt and Asyria in their arms and culture, and much that we have in this respect related of Aithiopes and Phenicians must be held to apply to them. Professor Sayce writes, that from the 17th to the 12th centuries they were strong enough to hold the balance of power between Egypt and Asyria, and that they had an empire extending over 6° of latitude, or from their holy city of Hebron to the Euphrates and Dardanelles.2 The Old Testament writers show that they were almost the complete rulers of Syria, Phenicia and Judea, in fact from Ephesus to all over Asia Minor and down to the confines of Arabia; for southern Judea was, says the Old Test., inhabited by “the children of Heth,” and as to the. Jews of Ier-u-shalm, Ezekiel says in his xvith chapter (one so replete with impure words and ideas that it should be withdrawn from public reading), that their “father was an Amorite and their mother a Hittite;” and that when the Yahus settled there, they defiled it with every idolatry, iniquity, and abomination which existed amomgst all the coarsest faiths and rites of every rude people from the Nile to Kaldia,3 and continued there down even to Ezekiel’s time, or the 6th century B.C.

He adds, that in their faith, rites and bestialities, they were like to their sisters of Samaria and Sodom, but worse even than these, and therefore despised by the Philistines for their idolatries and obscenities; and if so in the 6th century, what were they before the days of the prophets? The LXX. translators call the Kheta, Xethaioi, but the Asyrian Khatti, and on the Egyptian monuments of Thothmes of the 16th century B.C. they are called Kheta, and described as a warlike people who had come from Tartary, and therefore probably of that great Kheti or Kutu stock which founded the Chinese empire. The early Hebrew records relate that they occupied all the southern parts, where in later days we find the Palashts or Philistines, showing that these were thus the descendants of Kheti, or possibly half breeds. All got mixed up with the early Bădawi Shemitik races, called by the Egyptians Shasus, by the KaIdis and others Sukhe, and by the Asyrians Sikhu, meaning “waderers and marauders;”1 and all were Is-Ra-Els in faith. Jews were but settled Suches, who were called Yahus, after their tribal god “The Yahu” or Y a h u ê . The name Shasu seems one like Scâoth or Scott in Keltik, a term for “filibusters” and with no faith-meaning. So Skuth was the Greeko-Keltik name given to all those nume-rous tribes who ever and again swooped down on the settled peoples of Asia Minor and the Grecian world, as did filibustering Scots upon Pictish Alban. When tribes settled, they lost such descriptive names. It is thought that the Aramæan or Arabo-Shemitik population, which occupied the deserts and highlands around the settled kingdoms of the Aithlopes of Syria and its coasts, became traders and appeared as such in the marts of Babylonia, “together with the non-Semitic Sumero-Akkadian population at a period as early as the 18th or 19th century B.C.” Thus Shemites developed from the Arabian Sabas, Shasu or Sukhi of the south, as Aryans did from “the wanderers” or Skuthi of high Asia; and the first received their faith-name from Shem or Sem, as the latter did from Ar or Ir, or As, both being deities of Sun and Fire, and symbolized by Lingams, Sun-stones, &c. Abram is described by Mr. Boscawin as “a primitive fellāhin, settled about Ur,” a shrine of Fire or Light worship. Though Sem or Shem became Sham or Shamas, the Sun, yet the radix is “The One, The Presence, the Sun, The Sign” of man or of a male deity—concretely, the pudendum,2 and was “a supreme spell” which the Rahim uttered as Shem-hamm-phorasch, when they wished to work miracles.

The record depicts the Chivi or Avi (another form of their name) as a peaceful, commercial and agricultural people, though scarcely one likely to sit quiet under the treacherous murders which the family of Jacob are said in Gen. xxxiv. to have perpetrated among them. These Chiti and Chivi gradually moved northward,2 as was the universal rule of all Arabian races, and in the 11th century—King David’s time—the latter seem to have been clustered about Hermon, and the former in the provinces around Tyre and Sidon —their chief towns. In Solomon’s time, the Chits were the greatest people in N.-W.

He was a patriarchal Tsur Oulemin, or the “Eternal Rock” of all Saturnes or Israels,4 and must not be confused with S e b or S e b e k , his more youthful Apolonik and ithyphalik form.5 As Set, Sut or Sutekh, he is usually seen with two staffs in his hands, the life symbol, or Crux ansata, and the cucufa or uas, denoting his “divine powers.” His worship, said Egyptians, extended over all the lath of “Seths” from Egypt to Moab; and he was called S e t h - O n i , or Seth of the Stone,6 and so worshipped by “stone-loving Arabians” and their Syrian congeners the Chiti, Chivi, Yahus, &c. His hieroglyph was an obelisk called the Meni, or “Man-symbol,” and usually shown ithyphalikly, as in the swathed Kem or Chem, of whom, and Meni, more hereafter. One Egyptian monument describes the Trinity of the land of the Shetha, as Amun, Phra and Seth, and defines their Ashtar. as the “God of bulls and waters” or fertilizing force, with a consort Astarte or Antarte, “Queen of waters, plains and sky.”7 Arabs said that Sethism was a form of Sabi-ism mixed with Lingam worship, and that it dominated Arabia till Islām arose. Seth only latterly, says Bunsen (I. 427), became the evil principle, Apophis or Typhon. He used to be associated with 1 Gen. xxxiv. 34. 2 Gen. xxiii. 7, et seq.; Num. xiii. 29. 3 Trans. Soc. Bib.

He is chained as Satan is to be, and held firmly by the strong hand of Amun, vide fig. 333. The good Apolo or Horos, once his friend, is often seen (fig. 336, p. 536) transfixing him in every coil with his solar darts or knives, as Krishna, the Indian Apolo transfixed the serpent Kaliya in the waters of the Jamuna, as Apolo transfixed the Pythons, and as Christ is to destroy that “Destroyer” Apollion or Abaddon—all being merely allegories of the solar destruction of the demon sterility, which Phrygia depicted in the stabbing of Mithras, vide Vol. I., p. 461. Even in Gnostik days, however, this serpent of evil had his admirers or detractors, as Mr. Sharpe here shows us in fig. 334. Still he was called, wrote this pious Egyptologists, “the Creator of the world,” or the “JOA, JAH, or JEHOVAH of the Jews,” for “JAO” appears on his shield, while a glory plays as here around his head.1 As Bishop Colenso and Dr. Oort2 also show, the early Jehovah was but a form of the Baal of Phoiniks and Kheti; so that Seth was Jahveh, and, as with Baal, we find his consort was Asherah, or “the Grove,” a rude form of Ken or Kesh, the Venus of Kadesh—the Khetite capital called after her “the loving one” see our figure and descriptions, page 82, also page 521, of Vol. 1. She was the Antarte or Ashtaroth of Kitinm in Kupros, Asebe or Ash-Hebe, as her sacred Ile of Cyprus was more anciently called.3 In form she was a nude Venus, with two long curls drooping over her shoulders; and her lord had one lock of hair, reminding us of the land of Sin, Zin or Zi-Ane, and of the old Kheti who probably imposed upon the Chinese their one long Pigtail, as well as the worship of this “God,” Ziān, the Thiān of China. Let us glance at these Venus. The hands of the Western goddess are generally seen supporting her capacious 1 S.

Worship of Venuses. 529bosoms, denoting “plenty,” which the word Asebe also seems to mean. She is the only western Venns of this kind who at present occurs to us, beyond, of course, the motherly Ceres, who is seen on p. 168 of our Vol. 1., pouring forth her milk upon the whole terrestrial ball—a later idea foisted on this ancient Rhea. In the East there are many Kens, and even in that faith, the pious founder of which would not look upon a woman. Dr. Kempfer gives us precisely such a goddess as the Kuprian one, in the Kwăn-yōn of Siam.1 She is a naked mother goddess sitting emphasizing her special power by the position of her hand, and with finger and thumb forming a yoni-loop. But the “Mother of mothers” par excellence is the Khwăn-yong, Qwă-on or Kwăn-wăn of Japan and China, that land which the ancient Khetai, when Meru-opes, quickened into civilization when all the world save Egypt lay in Kymerian darkness. Their Kwan-yon was and is one of the most elaborate pictorial developments of the idea of “Matter,” the “Watery Principle,” Nymphean, or “Yoni of Yonis,” as her name signifies. She is styled “the Queen of Heaven,” “Lady of Plenty,” “Goddess of one thousand arms,” &c.; and is constantly found described in popular works by writers to whom she is really an unknown deity, other-wise they would probably avoid the subject. We here give a photograph of her (Plate XVII.) from Dr Kempfer’s picture, which was most carefully drawn for him by one of her worshippers about one hundred and fifty years ago, and we recommend a minute study of all its marvellously detailed symbolisms. The goddess sits like “the Padmi Devi,” as Hindus would describe her, on a Lotus-throne under her lord, the Ilu or Thi-an, or Zi-Anu, as Akado-Kheti would call their cloudy Jove. Both are engaged in the contemplation of all the creative energies of nature, but especially of the womb, over which the goddess’s hands are upraised, and under which is “the golden vial” containing all the treasures of the gods, or as Hindus would say of Brahas-pati, whose lota2 is said to be ever full with Amrita or Soma-seka, “the Waters of Life,” or Life-giving Water. There too stands the budding “Tree of Life,” sacred alike to Jew and Gentile, while Ti’Shang or Thian broods over all with watchful eye, upraised arm and open hand, himself supported by two of the thou-sand arms of his Ruach Ale-im, without which nought is or can continue to be. This picture is the most perfect ideograph which in a very wide experience we have ever met with. It is a complete arcanum of the whole vast mythology, both spiritual and material. Although detailing nearly every concrete idea of the faith emblematically, it exhibits to us a symmetrical and philosophic whole, even from the solar JAH, dual “God of Light” sitting on his Cow-clouds, down to the wombal base, which rises like a refulgent flower from the Waters of Fertility, as does every true Venus. She is here, indeed, the true Om Mani Padmi hun or “Jewel of the Lotus,” that “gem” which has so puzzled not only European scholars 1 History of Japan, Ed. 1728, Pl. V. 2 The Ceylonese Bālis call this “Brahaspati’s full pot.” See Upham’s Buddhism, p. 94, Ed. 1829."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

See in the centre of her snaky tresses, bright with fruits and flowers, the reduplicated “Jewel,” exactly like that other one we give on our map, Plate III., at the end of this volume. That Yoni gem is said to contain all that is valuable in this world, viz., India. The Yoni is repeated again, as with Hindus, on the goddess’ ample forehead as a circle, “Dot or Shang,” the second hieroglyph necessary to complete the ineffable name of the Chinese Creator or SHANG-TI.1 This “Dot” or Shang thus corresponds in true signification with the Nekabah of Gen. i. 27, which makes the Hebrew god androgynus. Sinologues call the dot also a star or “circle on a line or field of water,” and it usually stands beside the Ti, Tau, or male sign, a radical expressed by a simple column springing also from a line representing the ground or water. The Tau only appears on a male god or man, and then shows (as when placed on the foreheads of the Jews of Ezekiel’s time) that such person was dedicated to a solo-phalik god. As the phalus of Terra, the T should usually he shown inverted, thus, ; and so it appears as a sectarial mark in India. Under the serene face of Kwăng-yōn, we see a “Winged Sun,” which these Asiatik Aithi-opes took with them to their various Western homes; and we also see two jewelled pendant crosses hanging from the wings, showing that the Cross-symbol was also introduced by these Kheti to the West with all its phalik significance as an emblem of life. See also on the goddess’ right and left, in complementary order, all the strange but usual symbols of the various attributes or characteristics of the male and female principles of nature, as well as of those higher developments of all faiths, in love, joy, prayer and religious contemplation. All these the goddess proffers with liberal and outstretched hand to every one who worships her “in spirit and in truth.” as some late writers on Japan tell us, in perfect ignorance of the ancient oriental phalik aspects of this faith. Let us glance in detail but briefly at some of the emblems here presented to us. Firstly, we see held high her own graphic emblem, the fire ark or burning bush, and the solar god with the chakra or solo-phalik Svastika, the book of life and sacred beads of her lord the “Brahma-Yoni,” typifying religion and piety. See how with open hand she distributes fruits and flowers and yoni-Ioops or joys of every form. She herself appears as Diana or the Lunar hare opposite to her lord, the Solar Cock, both of which are prominently placed surrounded by their circles, no doubt colored silver and gold. Beside these is the Mirror of Venus and Sistrum of “the Ever-Virgin” Isis or Maya, and opposite, the mythic banner and strange glans-like object which our own Kelts used to sculpture, and which we have already explained.2 Above is a censer of sacred fire, parallel to the vial of the gods, and a womb-like vase with strange cruciform head; whilst firmly held up high, is the royal sword, that 1 See our Fig. 336, p. 534. 2 Fig. 252, p. 261, and elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"Kwăng-Yōn or Mother Worship. The Chinese Cross and Shang Tî. 531phalik emblem still holy from Arabia to farthest Japan. The reader will remember it as the Cures of Skuthia and Mercurial Quires deity of the Quirinal, and that unknown godly symbol which ancient Kheti or Aithi-opes no doubt hung up in their Arabian ark the Al-kaaba, as second only in importance to the “Black Stone” itself.1 Beside “the Jewel” of this Arkite goddess stands, as before said, the fruiting leaf, or more probably that “budding tree” which, with the western race of Kuths or Kheti, developed into the form seen in fig. 8 of our Plate V., whilst beside the bow of love is the shuttle or distaff of womanhood; and the sacrificial culter of all Cultes, like to that of Para-su-Rām, the 5th Avatār of Solar Vishnu, the hammer of Vulcan and the Norse Tor. Such then, but not always, is this mother goddess of the far East, for Dr. Kempfer says she is at times a Multi-Mamnea, such as we show and describe at p. 234 of Vol. I. He says she is occasionally depicted as a mass of babies, who seem to grow out of her fingers, toes, and indeed whole body. At other times she is a snaky fish goddess, as seen in our fig. 38, p. 116 (also from China), where she is worshipping the Lingam in a moving sea of all things phalik. Her names are legion, and she is even yet the best worshipped deity of China and Japan; yet we feel assured she could never have been invented in all this imaginative detail by a dry, unreligious, unimaginative, unpoetical and practical people like the Chinese, who thirty centuries before our era began writing those great classics, “The Five Kings;” and who produced before the 6th century B.C. such commentators and independent philosophic thinkers as Con-fucius, Lâotze, Mencius, &c. Kwăn-yōn must have belonged to the far back mythik times of Pan-ku or San Hwang, when “the twelve Celestial Sovereigns” ruled, and ages before the Wu Ti or “Five Tis” and Chinese nation arose. We therefore con-clude that she was the Solar Ceres of a prior people such as the Meru-opes or Aithi-opes, before they left their high-Asian home; and was carried to China by their “Kutu or Keti” tribes, who in name at least still hang around N.-W. China; evidence may yet be forthcoming that the western Kheta, Kuthi or Kushi are their descendants. We can only expect to find in such an ancient civilization and literature as that of China faint traces of Nature Worship, but ever and again it involuntarily appears in the writings of Christians, often too pious and too ignorant of the subject to understand what they see, hear and describe. To some, however, it is well known, for lately a missionary, the Rev. T. M’Clatchey, wrote that “that worship which has permeated the whole heathen world” still exists in China. “The old phallic God,” as well as his God, he indignantly complains, is still “represented under (the same) two indecent symbols, viz. the Khëen or Yang, which is the Membrum Virile, and the Khwăn or Yin, or pudendum muliebre, or Yoni of Hindus and Juno of Greeks and Romans.”2 The pious missionary's protest arose on that ever vexata question, the origin and proper translation of his God and Heaven-idea, and the result of the 1 See in Indexes and Dulaure’s Hist.

Eastern Aborigines. 532controversy is, that the Chinese K h wăn is a varient of the K a i w a n , which Aithi-opes took with them to their Western home in Arabia and Syria. Thus Jews got their Chiun, as India had her Kun, Kusi and Kunti—the Earth Goddess, and Europe its Queen, Qvân, Qvôn, Coinne, Cwene and Kone. In China and the West, the Khëen and Khwăn, or Yang and Yin, got spirit-ualized, being defined as “Light and Darkness,” the modes by which, said the writers of the Confucian era, “the demiurgik Horse or Mind” created all things. This god-idea the writers of that period called SHIN, and his power, they said, was “the air” (the Hindu creating Maruts) or Shang-Tî, acting on the Yin or Khwăn—“the Anima or sentient soul,” also a Sivaik doctrine. Without the Khëen-Khwăn, said these later metaphysicians, neither the Shin nor Shang-Tî could act; only Zang-Yon, “the male and female,” or “only Yang-Yin-Air can act;” and this they describe as an Incarnation or the Logos of Shang-Tî. But the original Shin is simply the early supreme Moon deity, called by Akads and Kaldis, Sin, by the Chinese Thien, and by all Indians Chan-d. Sanskritists still term “the Moon” Indu, and China calls India Thien-chu, where chu equals du or tu. But Shin like all moons is identified with the Yin, Yoni or Yun, for, say old Chinese dictionaries, “Shin should be pronounced Yuen or Yun, a sound very close to yn or in;” so Hwen Tsang and other Chinese writers explain, that India with them is “the Moon” that is Thien-chu, Shin-tu, Hien-teu or Yun-tu, and that therefore Tî-en = Hî-en = Yun = Yin, which is the female of Yang.1 Thus the moon was in these early days a dual primary deity; when Tîen, a male like Soma, and when Yin, a yoni or female like Chandrî. China or Sina thus clearly got its name from its Sin, Ti-en or Tsî-en worship. It was pro-minently called Sina during ita Tsin dynasty of 249-202 B.C., when fighting in Central and Western Asia for its great book-burning emperor, Tsin-she-hwang-Tî, who then made his name feared both on the Ganges and the Kaspian.2 Gradually Sin, Shin or Chan gave place to other names, alike in the far East as in Kaldia, but still we must in tracing the origin of ideas, not forget that the base is its dual deity Tchin and Yun or Yin. As explained by the philosophers and spiritualists of the 6th century B.C., Shin was termed “Unalterable Law,” moving in air and acting through Yang, the agitator or whip3 (such as Khwan-yon is seen holding in Plate XVII.) upon Yin, then described as “Rest or receptive female vis enertiæ.” Gradually Shin or Sin became “a unity, omnipresent, immaterial, a passionless principle,” and finally Divine Reason, a spirit and a soul,” but “not the Rational Soul.” SHINwas said to generate\" the incorporeal earth and heaven,” called “a Yang and Yin Thing,” by means of “Yang-Yin Air,” which was termed Shang Ti, \"a Manifestation of Incarnation,” or “All Father;” and 1 Budhist work Ling-yen-tzi-chu, Chinese Dic-tionary Ching-tseu-thong, and other authorities quoted in M.

It requires to be acted upon by the Tî, Male god or Sun—represented alike in china and Akadia, as by the High Asian Khutus and the Syrian Kheta, by his universal emblem the pillar or obelisk. Let us look closer at these primary symbols of infantine alphabets already touched upon and illustrated on pages 235-6, Vol. I., for some appear to be radical and concrete emblems of the God-idea, which Turanian peoples have handed down to Shemites and Aryans. The reader should consult in these researches, the largest and oldest charac-ters in Chinese, Egyptian and Akadian hieroglyphs. We subjoin a few over leaf, in fig. 336 with their acknowledged significations; but before entering on the details beg our reader’s attention to an important pamphlet on the subject by Chinese scholars, which has come to our notice whilst this chapter was passing through the press. It is a proof of the substantial accuracy of our line of research, and is the first note of a new departure, philologically, on the affinities of the ancient Chinese and Akadian tongues.1 The hieroglyph for a Father, pronounced Ku-wen, says Mons. Lacouperie, repre-sents a man “grasping an object delineated by a stroke, sometimes thick at the top and fine at the bottom, and vice versa. . . . whether ‘Stick’ or ‘Flame’ . . . . a sort of cone of wood which may almost certainly be taken to mean the Generator of Fire, like the Pra-Mantha of the Vedic hymns, of which the use is shown in the religion known among the Akadians.” Thus then this Pra-Mantha or “exquisite Matha” or “Heavenly Phallus,” the fire or “twirling stick” of the ancients, else- where fully treated of, was the Kuwen of the Chinese, now called Father or “man with the stick”—the Khëen or Yang of p. 531 ante. Mons. Lacoupene adds to various surmises which remain yet to be proved, that the Yih King or earliest Chinese sacred book (said to have been written about 2850 B.C., or the time of the Emperor Hoang Ti) was originally written in hieroglyphs like to those in Akadia (if the arrows be combined in figures), and in a language which we may believe the Kutus of High Asia wrote before their descendants the Kuths or Kushites went forth to Babylon. Mons. Lacouperie here gives us some striking samples of the similarity between the “Ancient Chinese, Akadian and Susian dialects,” and a table of hieroglyphs showing their “common origin” and perfect likeness, “in sound and words.” as in such terms as “eye, moon, anger, north, kick, bull,” &c. “Certain portions of the Yh King,” he says, “are only lists of meanings that pointedly recall the Akadian cunieform syllabaries, and which belong to one dialect of the same family.” He finds that the Emperor Hoang-ti was Nakkonti 1 Lecture on Early Chinese Civilization by Mons.

Various similar names and circumstances confirm the lecturer’s and our own researches. But to resume the consideration of the early alphabetic symbols, and for clearness we will briefly name and describe each so far as space permits opposite to each line of the figures. I. TÎ the Pillar God, Creator, “The Supreme Monad.” The King’s Sceptre, a ruler, man, power. “The One” but without his second or Female Energy necessary towards “The Perfected One.” The Shang-Tî and the Zî of Akads. The Khem, Toth, Hermes and Jupiter Stator of the West II. SHANG, “the heavenly Dot,” the Moon Shin poised over the waters. The inverted , Zăn or Yang—“man” or his emblem with phalus or knobbed stick. III. The arrow is As or Ashr in Asyrian. The horizontal phali, read in Egyptian A, Aba, Osiris or God; and the vertical is the Arabian sign for A and Allah or “God “ the Ālat or Phalus, and is called Alif. The Akad A or the cuniform arrow was called Zikaru or “The Male Thing,” “Nebu’s Ray,” the “Sword” or Zakar of Hebrews. In Sanskrit A is Vishnu, the Supreme Fertilizer. IV. Symbols of SHANG-TÎ as “the All-Powerful,” “The More-than-Man,” or Pillar God with double conventionally formed phali. He is the CROSS set on High, standing firmly in the earth and “reaching up to heaven” as Siva is usually described; also the Mandara or “Churner” of Vishnu’s Ocean. V. The dual form of Shang-Tî as Sing-Lê or Shin-Lê, being the God and his virgin ark or sistrum. In the inverted with one phalus, we have Zan, San or Dsan, the Chinese for “Man,” and a variant of Yang, the Phalus or Sun of No. IV.; but here we have “Man” with two phali, hence Yang-Tî, “God.” VI. A God-man or double phalused one. The Lê or Tî, “by the virtue of which Shang-Ti generates.” But like No. I. the God is incomplete. He is the Zi of Akads, a celestial Zi-Anu. without Terra or “Matter” by which alone he can act. This Zi, De, Ti or Tse is the base of most divine names. Zi was a very important Akadian radical sign, and sound for “God” or the “Holy Spirit.” Hence came Zi-Anu or “God Anu,” “the Heavenly Spirit,” the Zi-hr of Hebrews, and Dzikr of Arabs, “the male one” or thing or sword of the Nekaba of Gen. i. 27, and the Zi or Zuth of Pelasgi and Zeus of Greeks. The High Asia Zi-an was Thi-an, Chi-ang, Chang, Shang, Sang, Sin, &c. But Yang is Zan or Zang, for if Zan is conjoined with Shang, as shown in the second line of our fig. 336, then the God is complete, and we are told to read “Creator;” so that not only is Zang = Yang, but either is the equivalent of Tî, for Yang-Tî is “God” and the God of the Christian Chinese Bible! Thus this Zan or “Man” is no mere homo or humid creature, according to the childish etymology of our youth, except in the strong Hindu light of his being “the Bull Waterer,” the Sanskrit, Vrishaba, Mantha, or Muto, the Greek Mutó, and Latin Mentulo. "},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"Early Alphabetic Symbols. Their Divine Significance. Menê. 535With Non-Aryans, man was the Egyptian Menê, and was symbolized by the obelisk, the Mena, M’nevis or bull, that is the Man-apis, the Greek Minos, and Keltik and Kymrik Menas or Mann. With Egyptians, Menê or Menes was the erect, stable, strong one, and Toth; and latterly the one of mind, wisdom and learning, for all this was engraved on the Menê, but nevertheless the roots of all such males and females are traceable to the organs. Măn-Eros or Lunus cupido was “the only son of Apolo,” for whom Greeks said women wept. Etruskans instructed Italians to love and honor Mania, as “the mother” of their little phalik images, the Mercurial Manes or Lares, and occasionally to sacrifice children to her as Hindus used to do to Kāli and Durga—forms of Mănia. Greeks feared her and said she was “a mad fiend, a gorgon of night, and slayer of reason.” Ceylonese as well as Finns and Skands called Mani a serpent lunar deity, which seems to show that both learned this Bālism from the Kutus or Kusias of Asia. The old Stone deities of Arabia were called Măna, Alât and Ālat, and to the latter the Prophet flung stones, calling him Mena or Minê, as he passed near his karn by the cone of holy Arafat, at the entrance of the Măkan valley gorge. Kelts too called their large sacred stones Mæens or Mens, and Origen rebuked Jews for worshipping Mene kai Selene, showing us that even then, Meni was there as in old Egypt, the Solar Stone; and we know that in Isaiah’s . time, Jews wrsShipped Gad or the God of Gad and Meni (lxv. 11), who according to the Talmudists was Venus, the consort of Măn. Egyptians said Mena was “a nurse or mother,” and that Men or Măn was Apis. Still in Arabia, Măn or Măna is Desire, and semen virile. With Egyptians, the symbol like an inverted phalus if no longer reading Osiris or B, stands for A ́ and “a weapon” like that which “the father” of the Chinese, says Mons Lacouperie, holds in his hands. When these objects are re-duplicated, a God-man is always signified, as showing he is so much more than a man. In early Chinese, TI and SHANG often interchange, as the ark of a god often stands for the god himself, and both are here suggestively signified by ├ a column with a central shaft, like to the swathed figures of many ithyphalik gods, as Kem of Egypt. That Shang is often female, we see in its symbolizing the barred box or sistrum, the sign of Isis, “the As” or Ish. So we find the Zăn or Man-sign, when crossed by two phali, becomes a god or “the divine Yang,” and when coupled with the sistrum the whole, or “The Perfect One” or SHANG-TI, and “the highest dual form of deity, otherwise called also Sing-Lê, another term for this Mahadeva. No wonder then that the Rev. T. M’Clatchey urges his missionary brethren to reject Shang-Ti as a sign and term for their god, “just,” he says, “as the apostles rejected the phallic Jupiter, which latter name, Origen says, the early Christians would never endure in consequence of its connection like that of Shang-TI with impurity.” If, however, we are to act on these grounds, we shall have no divine nameg at all! certainly not Theos, Dzeus, Deus, or any of the Toth, Teut, Teu, Dieu, The, Ti or Di type; nor yet Allah, Il, El or Elohim, nor Jehovah or rather Yahu-ê, Yah, Jah, Bra or "},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

Regarding the root meanmgs of all these the ancient fathers were mostly innocent, and, fortunately for their peace of mind, the modem ones are so also. Mr. M’Clatchey’s plain-speaking seemed irritating to the orthodox, and was quietly put aside. Neither the Professor of Chinese nor other Oxford philologists disputed his facts, nay, they agreed that “a system of Nature worship is an integral part of the state religion of China;” but the missionary was instructed to accept the old “Chinese sky gods,” Ti, Ti-en and Shang, as sufficiently correct words for Jewish and Christian gods, and to translate the Bible accordingly! They “had now,” he was told, “become fully spiritualized conceptions,” although formerly applied to the ancient heroes Yāo (Jao!) and Shun, in order to deify them.”1 Oxford, therefore, directed that Ti, be “God,” Shang-Ti, “The Supreme God,” and Thien, “The Great One” or High Sky God! which, however autocratic, is as solo-phalikly correct as could well be. So Jehovah-Elohim is now written in old phalik symbols, Thi-en Shang Ti; and “Lord” or Kurios, is Ku, “the equivalent,” says Professor Legge, “of Ti,” and pointing to Aithiopes bringing this word also to the West in Kur, the Sun. It is also urged that Shăn be used for Spirit, as “The Holy Ghost;” and “Ling, for the quality of that Spirit, and never Făng.” It is clear that we owe the word Ling to the old Non-Aryans, for the horizontal knobbed stick or phalik sword was called by them Ti and Lē, and this last is still the vulgar word for the male organ among Barmans and all adjoining peoples, whilst Lu, its variant, = “Man” or Zan. The crossed or A forms the phalik plowshare, that ancient sign manual of Indian Rajas, equivalent to the + of Christian Bishops and the leaf of Budhist High Priests. In the ordinary free literature of China, the knob of the Lē is lost in a generally broad dash, just as indeed it is in the ordinary shikust or running hand of Arabs and Persians; so the reader is requested, in this investiga-tion, to look back to the best well formed and enlarged ancient symbols. This Lē is, in fact, the sword or dart with which Apolo destroys the wintry serpent (see fig. 336, and p. 528 ante) as well as Rama’s plowshare, which acts on Sita, “the seed furrow.” It is the javelin idea in the hand of Pallas and Athene, and the arrow which passes through the phalik heart which hangs on the neck of Apis; see our fig. 49, Plate XIII. 9, p. 316, and similar symbolisms on pages 166 and 152. The Ti or Le was also the Mongolian sceptre, the kingly sign of Barma, and an ordinary banner insignia; and the Lē or Lu are the Loos or “the Men” or Zangs, the name of an important race occupying Northern China, the cradle land of the old Khetai. The radical meanings of the Chinese Lu and Sanskrit Ling are therefore the same, viz., “the essence, root, base, pith or sprout,” physical, and spiritual or metaphysical. Hence the Lu-li is with Chinamen a “Code of Primary Laws,” but we are wandering too far into our Chinese chapter. 1 Letter to Professor Max Müller.

Of course the story is typical of the fall and rise, or death and life of nature’s fertile energies. Kiyōto, the Japanese capital, rejoices, says Miss Bird, in “33,000 representations of the goddess Khwan-yon,” described as pre-eminently” the hearer and answerer of prayer,” and a goddess of mercy, whose cultus is still the most popular throughout the empire. On her dimly lighted altars stand gigantic candlesticks, lamps, lotuses, godly images and sacred books, and around them softly move shaven priests in chasubles and stoles, chiming sweet sounding .gongs and tinkling cymbals, and murmuring prayers and liturgies, in an atmosphere ever heavy with sweet incense. These are all, says Miss Bird, “the mysterious symbols of a faith which is a system of morals and metaphysics to the educated and initiated, and an idolatrous superstition to the masses.” Prayers are here, she says, often a mere “interlude in the gurgle of careless talk without a pre-tence of reverence;” but here also she found “earnest men and women, bringing real woes in simple faith” to a throne of never ending mercy and beneficence, and pleading “in low voiced supplications with closed eyes, and an agony no less real than that which ascends to our Father in heaven, from anguished hearts in England.”1 The religion of the ports of China as it exhibited itself to Arabs in our 9th Cent., was Magian,2 that is, solo-fire worship, with sorcery and the rites of Bâlism, precisely what the Akado-Kaldians or Western Kheti developed.3 And evidently the same race and faith ruled in the Panjāb during Alexander’s invasion; for he mentions fighting, not far from Amritsar, a powerful people called Kathai, whose capital was Sangala; and we know that 1000 years before that, or in the days when the solar Aryan, Rāma, was pressing all non-Aryan peoples, a great region of India called the Kekeya Des was ruled by “Katæi;” and these we still have as Khatris, no doubt the ancient Kshatriyas, whom Vishnuites aver their god finally destroyed or drove out when he appeared as Parosu-Rāma, their 6th incarnation.4 This agrees with what we have just described in the Aryan wars with Bālism, and shows that these “Katrei” were non-Aryan Meru-opes. But to return to our Western researches, The earliest seat of the Kuprian Ken—our Paphian Venus was, says General Cesnola, at Golgoi, where we may be certain she was in early days no statue, but, as the writer in Smith’s Greek and Roman Geography says, “a rude conical (or rather ovicular) stone.” 1 Miss Bird’s Japan, p. 69. 2 Travels of Two Arabians in 9th Century A.D., p. 14, Renaudot’s translations. 3 Lenormant’s Chaldean Magic. 4 Dr. J.

The Kuprian goddess had sacred groves beautifully situated at Idalion or Dali, Kitium or Larnaka, Kurion, &c., near to, or within dark forests, or on the slopes of the Olumpos of their old Zi-An and later Zeus. There her votaries buried their dead, and there have been found vazes, gems, coins, &c., denoting a considerable and artistic civilization. At Dali, near the remains of a Phenician or Kitian temple, was found a bowl or caldron on which was en-graved a bi-lingual inscription, and figures of musicians and worshippers dancing round a central female figure standing near an altar. The writer in Smith’s Dictionary states that “here were deified the generative powers of nature, common to Phenicians and mixed up with the orgiastic rites of Phrygia;” and that here Greeks “embraced and diffused the cruel and voluptuous rites of Phenician worship;” but “the islanders never developed,” the writer adds, “the nobler features of Hellenic culture.” That was a far later pro-duct. The old races seem to have kept pace with their brethren on the mainland. At Golgoi some 800 Egyptian and Asyrian figures and tablets have been unearthed near to the sites of old temples. One figure is a Herakles or Bāla-deva clad in a lion’s skin, and armed with the phalik club and Cupid’s bow and arrows; whilst below is the triple Geryon, whose cattle (worshippers?) the solar god has carried off. The votive offerings denote the worship of fertility, in women and animals suckling their young. Here also was found a huge caldron like “the Sea of Solomon,” or of the Keltik Cerid-wen, but far larger than either, being some 7 ft. in diameter, and requiring Phenician skill to construct. Greeks call it a perirrhanterian, and General Cesnola thinks it stood like the Jewish “Sea” on the right hand side of the temple porch. Its sculpturings exhibit Linga and Yoni symbols such as serpents and dolphins. A sort of “Mut hill” at Kitium has yielded figures showing the worship of Demeter and Persephone, with fictile vases and marble bowls bearing Phenician inscriptions. The subtle artists show that they were familiar with literature and art, for they knew that which was only legendary with Greeks, viz., “the Kuklik poets, the Cypria, the Aithiofria, the Iliou-persio, the Lesser Iliad, the Nostor, the Telegonia, and a host of others whose very names are lost to tradition.” Thus Greece had here put down at her very doors, and just when she was becoming able to appreciate literature and art, all that was necessary for her instruction; and step by step from 600 B.C. did she deny her instructors, and drive out them and their confreres, first from the ports and then from their inland cities. The busy artists may be said to have ruled all the principal coasts and ilands till the first quarter of the 8th century B.C., after which period, Leleges and others of Pelasgik extraction began to displace or absorb them. Greeks seem to have always recognized Kitium as a Phenician city. Its native name was Amta-Khadasta or “the Holy Lady,” their Ken or Dea-Syria, but the igno-rant thought the word was Amno-Chosta or “Sandbank,” which we term Fama Gousta, a good sample of how much we err on a priori assumptions when we depart from faith derivations. In the Old Testament, Cyprus is Vadan the Asyrian Yadnam, whose "},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"Cyprus, its Venus and Remains. Fall and Rise of Kuthim. 539people are called Kithim or Chits,1 and the bracketing of these with the Dodan-im or Rodan-im, our Rhodians, is, says Sir H. Rawlinson, very appropriate; for Yadnam is a cognate form of Dedan or Tidian. The Vadan or Javan of Ezekiel xxvii. 19 is clearly Cyprus and Greece.2 And as the Kheti have been much in the far East, the word Javan would seem to have been either applied generically to ilands, as to Java and Hawa, or to littoral or insular worshippers of a solo-phalik Jah. Sir Henry says that “the autochthons of Cyprus—possibly Danāns—were not disturbed by Pheni-cians till 2000 B.C.,” but “autochthons” are a people we have never yet discovered! The consort of Ken or Kesh became, says Prof. Sayce, “Resheph the Sun God,” as Kesh-Oph or Ra-Esh-Oph, the solo-phalik serpent, whose chief seat was Phaliga3 or Kar-chemish, the Asyrian Gar-gamis and Latin Circesium or Karkisia, names similar to Heliopolis, but in Phaliga probably pointing to his name as “the Fruiter” or “Bud bearer,” as this would still signify in the East. The topography as usual accorded with the faith, for Phaliga was on a triangular or yoni-like iland, at the junction of two holy rivers, like Siva’s sacred town and shrine at the bifurcation of the lower Kāveri, where too is Párvati, the Indian Ken, Kium, Chium, Queen or The Woman of Turans and Aryans. Ken’s consort was also a form of Siva as “Lust,” being called Kesh or K’Esh or Kha-Eshvāra, that is, Ka (the Prajāpati of Hindus) the Esh, Es or Linga; for Ka in Egyptian is the Linga, “root or essence,” with the hieroglyph of phalus and testis which also stand for Osiris and Apis. It was an affix of honor, like Sa, Sir, Sirah, &c., from Sa-Ra, the Sun or “High One.” The feminine form Ch or Koptik K was “the prostrate gland or vagina.”4 From Kesh and Ken would come the name of the ancient Hamathite capital Kadesh, so sacred to their mother goddess, and also the horrible Kadeshim rites, not peculiar to, though common in, Jewish and all ancient Asiatik shrines, and which Sanskrit shows us are connected with all horrors of lewdness in such words as Kataksha, Kati, As, &c.6 When Thothmes ruled Egypt in the 17th century, the Naharaim or Asyrian Nahri were called one of the chief peoples of Western Asia, and in the records of his successor, Thothmes II., the principal Syrian nation was that of the Ludim or Rutenu. His great successor, Thothmes III. of the 15th century, exacted tribute from them, the Kheti, and from Babylon and Nineveh. Indeed all the lands of Cushites, to the confines of Armenia and Kurdistan (where this monarch hunted elephants), the Pelopo-nesos and ilands of Kretê, Rodes, Kupros, &c., and wherever the Aithiopo- Phoinikes dwelt, seem to have readily acknowledged this Aithiopik emperor; and under his sovereign rule Phoinikes seem to have practically dominated all lower Egypt, from Memphis to Kaphtor, and up the coast to their kingdom of Arvad. Only by their aid was the XVIII. Dynasty able to develop its aggressive power. It was fleets built and manned by these mariners, which conquered, says Mr Gladstone, all the ilands of 1 Gen. x. 4; Num. xxiv. 4. 2 R. Geog. Soc.

The wars which culminated in the Troas, and which the Homerik poets have im-mortalized and mystified in the grand old Epos, drove Egyptians out of Asia Minor, and in the fall of Troy, sounded the first warning that the ancient races must now give place to others invigorated with northern Aryan blood. Neither Aithiop nor Shemite were to continue to advance westward; but blended in one, they were to hold Western Asia for yet many a century, against all Aryan comers.2 The Trojan legends mark far more a disruption of races and faiths, than the clang of arms. Every name and detail bespeaks this, but it is difficult to read through the maze, where so much philology and so intimate a knowledge of old faiths and races are absolutely necessary. Of Jews we hear nothing during all the Thothmik wars, unless they be in- cluded among the phalik-worshipping “Hermonites” who are mentioned as inhabit-ing the highlands of Syria. All local rule emanated from Arvad, Tyre, Argos, &c., during all the XVIII. Dynasty, or say from 1700 to 1460 B.C., and in fact down to 1130. When Tiglath Pilesar I. ruled Asyria, “the Kheta were the paramount power,” says the Rev. Professor Sayce, “from the Euphrates to Lebanon.”3 We have no real historical evidence of the persons or kingdoms of David or Solomon, though we may grant the Jewish stories cum grano salis, seeing how outrageously they have always exaggerated in everything pertaining to their own glorification.4 They somehow got hold of the fine masonry works constructed by the great old builders on the heights of J eb1.tsi, Ym'ah, or Shalm, as Jerusalem was variously called by Egyptians, Kheti, Phoinikes, &c.; but everywhere we only find Phenician characters, and not Hebrew. The very pottery about the so-called temple of Solomon is Hitite or Khetian, and called\" the keramik work of King Shet;\" and it Wag these Shethites who replaced the empire of the Naharas and established such holy places, as Yerah or Salem, Hebron, Gerezim, &c., whose traditions Jews adopted but slightly modified. The reader will see succinctly the role of the old Aithiopian races by perusing our chart carefully from 2200 downwards, when Ninus was traditionally found- ing Babylon and all its provinces, then inhabited by Turano-Sumirs, Akads, &c., and when the Xiotes were trenching on the Nile, and their Arabian brethren moving on to Syria. In the 20th century, the Elams or Solarists of the Euphrates and Egyptians of Aithiopik blood fiercely attacked the Asyrian Naharaim, and established a tributary rule, which Egypt maintained for 600 years. Note also that peoples like the Tuath-de-Danans, were then flying westward, even to the extremities of Ireland, and that in the 18th century, “Kuthites and Aithiopians were moving every- where.” Thus only remnants of the old races would remain in Western Asia, though 1 Juventus Mundi, pp. 146-148. 2 Od.

The Chiti had a pure Turano-language of the Alarodian or proto-Armenian type, with an alphabet of their own, and for many centuries, says Professor Sayee, it had no trace of Shemitik characteristics, at least so long as they ruled Southern and Central Asia Minor. Even after their sway was somewhat compressed in the north, they maintained their own tongue down to the time of Sargon and Senakerib, or say to the 8th century B.C. Their language was therefore older than Phenicio-Aramaik, in which form, it passed to Aryans, as seen in early Greek and Keltik characters. Its A or Alif [a Shemitik word] was not the usual plowshare or phalus, but “an ox or part of an ox.” The letters may be described generally as shafts with crosses in or without circles, suns and lunettes, vases, lotuses, and sundry other very suggestive phalik objects.1 Many seem modifications of the Budhist fig leaf or Greek f, Phi, and such sexual symbols as are given in our figs. 226 and 233, pages 152 and 166. The name of God appears to be usually some combination of the solar vase or Brahma’s lota, with a shaft and a cross below. Often the shaft is shown passing through a sheath, precisely like the so-called “feathers” of the pestle and mortar pot of Amun and other of Egypt’s chief gods. The knob or bag is shown by Professor Sayee, with a seed or egg in each division, and as such it forms the head of a man; confirming the India euphemistic idea, which often identifies the head or glans with Siva. Another Hitite character is coarsely suggestive of that given as No. 1 in our fig. 77, p. 196, Vol. I. But the most pronounced Hamathite hieroglyph, and one very common in Kupros, is a twisted shaft like a worm or serpent, with two cists on each side, regarding which the Rev. Professor adopts Mr Hyde Clarke’s suggestion, that “it denotes the organs of generation.”2 The so-called Svastika of Troy, Kupros, and Atika, is also thinks Mr Sayee, of Hitite origin; and as it occurs, according to him, “in the triangular pelvis of the Babylonian Artimis Nana . . . . as the symbol of generation,” it must have the same signification as our looped cross, which for decency sake, we substitute for the erect member and yoni of the Indian Ardha Nâri on our Plate XIV. p. 374.3 Thus the phalik Svastika and the Cross, were used by a Turanian people who ruled the most civilized portion of Western Asia before 1900, and down to 900 B.C. In the bi-lingual Hitite and cuniform plate of Tarkondemos, described by Mr. Sayce in the same journal, the chief hieroglyphs are phali and yonis, goat’s heads, and objects precisely like the ordinary tri-lingas of India. The monarch holds a spear or pole, pointing his forefinger forward, and has the turned up Eastern shoe common to all Hitites. The yonis are strangely feathered, and the phali or obelisks are in pairs, and denote “kings” or a “country,” but although surrounded with the obeliskal cuniform character, also of evident phalik conception, the reading is as yet uncertain. It is held by Professor Sayce that the first descent of the Kheti upon Syria, was about 1900 B.e., before Shemites were heard of, and that they were from a high 1 Professor Sayce’s Art., Jour. Soc.

Both the upper Kaukasian and Baktrian colonizers, would very probably wear heavy boots and gloves, as the dwellers in these highlands still do for eight or nine months of every year. Tablet literature shows that Kapadokia and all the countries about and south of the Kaukasus were once inhabited by Aithiopes and Akads. Mr T. G. Pinches argues from the Kapadokian tablet that that country, and in fact all the north of Asyria, as well as Babylonia, was the home of the Akadian race.1 We believe that Kaukasia was only one of the abodes of a colony of Meru-opes, who on leaving their high Asian home, took this route westward. Babylonian Akads would most probably be those who took the S. W. route from Bâal or Balk, but the founders of the Delta king-dom, were their sea-borne brethren, the Eruthri. Those who lived in Kaukasia of course passed south and became the Kheti and Hamaths of Armenia, Asia Minor and Syria. As their brethren had reared Tin-tira or “The place,” says M. Lenormant, “of the Sacred Tree, on the site which was yet to be the Bab-Ilu of a later half Shemitized people,” so the “gloved and booted” Akads or Kheti of Syria, planted their sacred Oak or Mamre on the heights of Hebron, and their Groves, Ashers and Asheras where Phoi-nikes and Yahus were to worship these, as their nature gods and their Lord Zedek. The capture of Sardes and Lydia by Kimeri about 1080, was thinks Professor Sayce, really a Hitite conquest by an allied tribe of Kilikians. Sardes is probably called after the Kilikian deity, Sandan. Sandes or Di-Sandan, elsewhere Morrheus, query Mah’ Rhea? Sandux was a Greek term for the linen garments with whieh Omphalê or Attê clothed Herakles. We read of the following Kilikian deities, Adan (Adam?), Son of Earth and Sky, Ostasos, Kronos or Tzedek, Rhea, Iapetos and Olumpros. At Komana the Chiti had an Aba-Kles (Father of Assembly?) or supreme pontiff, with 6000 priests, and Hebron was their Kirjath Sepher, or city of books, and Egyptians called their king Kirab-Sar, “a writer of books, papyri or parch-ments,” whilst Shemites associated their very name with learning.2 We shall no doubt therefore yet find their writings and sculpturings over all Western Asia and down the two old-world rivers. We are already deciphering those of Hamath on their sacred Orontes, some forty miles north of Emesa, and finding others at Khurbu, the Greek Helbon, our Alepo; at Jerablus or Karchemish, Bulgar-maden, Boghaz-keui, Pleria, Eynk Lukonia, and at Karabel on the pseudo Sesostris. But we must use the pick and spade if we hope to get many fresh in-scriptions. Hundreds of great Aithiopik cities lie buried in the Tels of Western Asia, and only now are we making any serious efforts to discover some, as that of the once great and holy capital on the Orontes, sacred to the Kadeshian Venus. It was the capital of the Rutenu Hitites, or “the Luds” or “Men of Cheth,” so important in the Egyptian wars of the 18th and 19th Dynasties. What with Egyptians on their south-west, and Asyrians on their north-east, these Kheti gradually went towards Hamath, 1 Procs. Soc. Bib. Arch., Dec. 1881. 2 Trans. Soc. Bib.

This is seen in their arts, sculpturings, language and dress; for there they wore “long beards, curled hair, and robes descending to their ankles,” and thus differed from the description given of them on the earliest Egyptian monuments, viz., “a Tartar-like race, with shaven crowns, one single long lock of hair, and wearing coloured garments”—all very charac-teristic of Chinese Kutus and Eastern Mongolians.. Old Testament stories show that the Chethi were held in high respect and fear by the Yahus on the Syrian Aram, down to past Solomon’s days; and only after Egypt captured Kadesh were the neighboring races able to rise effectually against them, when they broke up into different kingdoms, and in this weakened condition fell a prey to Asyria, whose King Sargon captured their last monarch, Pisiris, in 717 B.C. In a few generations after this, when our cyclic clock had pealed its fatal 6th century, they were either dissipated among the neighboring iland races, or absorbed into the nationalities on the mainland, where especially in the south, they became Shemitized in religion and language. Northerly however, throughout the ilands and European states of the Mediteranean, where the Aryan wave principally increased in volume and intensity, they were Aryanized, or driven onwards; only here and there standing out effectively and for a short time, against the fast increasing half-Aryanized Pelasgi Achaians, Leleges, Karians, Ionim, &c. Some evidently passed away far west into Spain, Gaul, and even Ireland, where as in their probable descendants the Tuath de Danâns, their rites and worship continued replete with Tower, Fire, and other phalik reminiscences.1 There we have found all their old Kuthite characteristic emblems, as ”a sacred sword, stone, cup and spear,” and that “sacred stone,” said tradition, came from Asia or Africa, and remained cherished by new Aryan nations as the Keltik Leach Fal, on or near to which all kings of Picts, Scots and Britons have been crowned, including our present Queen. Now seeing the early Arabian home of this Fail or Fal, we must not forget that Falān and Falāni are the Lingam and Yoni of Arabia, the “Plower and Plowed” or the land to fertilize, cherish or Pālna, (Sanskt.) from the Akad word Pal or Yoni. The Felāh-in are the wielders of the Falâ, that is the plowers or agricultural popula-tion, in contradistinction to the Bădăwin or nomadik, and nominally Moslim desert wanderers. No doubt from this old Akad and Arab source, the Greeks and others got their words Pallas, Phallos, &c.; the Phenician, his Palash, the Hebrew, his Ph-l-a, and similar words; and India its numerous terms, Phal, Phulla, “Fruit and Fruiters” the expanding, sprouting and feeding ones,” matters which our Glossary will, however, especially deal with. It was these “Tursei, or tower builders,” who taught ancient Irish Gauls and Iberi, the art of using mortar, just as the Tyr-rhenian Pelasgi taught Greeks and other Aryans to do this. About the 7th century B.C. we can only slightly recognize the old Turano-Aithiopes 1 Cf. Vallency’s Collect. Hibern. cviii. and Keane’s Towers and Temples."},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c. Eastern Aborigines. 544in Shemitized Egyptians, Phoinikes, and in a few Arabian Mesopotamian tribes, and as Aryanized peoples, in Tyrrheno-Iberi, some Thrakians, Phrygians, llyrians, &c . The convulsions which led to their destruction and absorption have been termed “the Early Ages of Asia.” “The Middle Ages,” so far as regards Aryans, is that period, says Prof. Baldwin, which opened with Aryan conquests in the Troas, for then did Greeks enter on the scene and reap where they had not sown, a civilization, culture and cults, which Turans and Turano-Shemitik people had sown broad and deeply. Then did the Ida of Ilium and groves and mounts of all Asia Minor cast forth Palla-diums and other oracles, which were quickly enshrined on other Zions and Dodonas; but the prime movers, though by no means pure Aryans—nay, at first only Aryanized Aithiopes, in the many religions and civilizations which followed, were races to which the general name of Pelasgi has been given. Before however entering upon Pelasgian history let us say a few words regarding those who so long worked with, and finally absorbed them—the Aryans proper, and who, as Pelasgi, descended from Central Asia by Kaukasian and Baktrian or Bâal-ian routes. ARYANS.—When we speak of Aryans, we mean a people who eventually differentiated a distinct class of language, and thus got separated from the other ancient stocks amidst which they had lived for ages, and whom they must have long been practically identical with. All who are not polygenists and maintain substantially the Biblical story of a common parent, will grant this. Our studies lead us to believe that philologically the primitive language of the Aryan home must have been a Turano-Aryan, with a conglomeration of roots, out of which sprang the goodly tree recognizable in very early pre-historic times. Each race or tribe as it separated, gave prominence to, and then differentiated its own peculiarities, and hence came the distinctive characters of Turanian, Aryan and Shemitik tongues; yet, says Schleicher, “there are as many primitive languages as races.” Names and classes and the degree of differences in languages have therefore a distinct reference as to time. The generally accepted theory that all Aryans sprang from a central Aryan home, viz., far northern Baktria, the Pamir or “Roof of the World,” is one enunciated by Europeans on almost purely philological grounds. It is unsupported by any direct evidence as from Eastern literature, ancient or modern; but the linguistic reasons, combined with some others which ancient histories have enabled us to here follow up, both before and after our era, induce us to accept and endorse the orthodox theory, and this we illustrate roughly, and of course tentatively in the absence of direct proof, in our map, Plate II., prefacing this volume. Ancient Ariana then was that part of high Asia embracing the south of the Tian-Shan or high Muz mountains, or southern Turkestān, with a centre about Bokâra, which Col. Yule surmises may have been the Vihara or home of original Budhism. It embraced Yarkand, or Tian-shan-man-lu, a portion of the Mongol Kanate of Jagata1, and north of it lay the vast lands 1 Roy. Geo.

In the West this did not begin till some 300 years later. Samar-Kand was perhaps the first Kand or Kanate, and capital of Sumirs and when these Turans had passed on, then Katan, Katak or Kanak. Sir H. Rawlinson says Katak was “one of the very earliest settlements of the Aryan race, and one of their main points of civilization,” and that it was probably owing to “pressure from the Turanian races of the North-East, that the Aryans were driven from Koustāna (Katan) down upon India;”1 yes, and on through Ariana into Western Asia, the great civilization and wealth of which, as developed by Turans and then Turano-Shemitik races, they had no doubt long envied. Ariana, looked upon from a religious point of view, was that tract of earth where the worship of Ar, As, Er, or Ir, and similar names for “God” were first intensified, as opposed to the Tur, Tor, Hill, and Bāal worship of the Tur-ans or Hill, Tower, and Fire worshippers. The Irans or Aerans, which in Tartary now signifies the people of the plains and rivers,2 occupied all the old empire of Perses, Iran or Aria, from Păsārgādæ and its mountain ranges, eastward through Arakosia or Ara-Kusi to the lowest affluent of the Indus or Sindu, and in India, the land of “the Five Rivers” and Kashmer; also Bak-tria and the territory of the Sogdi and Asi or As-ians, as China has since 2000 B.C. called all those occupying the neighbourhood of the Oxus and the Kaspian.3 Of course Aryans have from time to time ruled parts of all this vast expanse of earth, embracing some 800,000 square miles, but Aria proper was the country between the two great mountain ridges, which, separating at one of the sources of the Oxus or Ochus, a little south of Balk, Baktra or Zariaspa, runs south and then west towards the cradle land of the Turanian Parthi or the vale of Hekatompulos, that buried capital of the Urkani or Fire worshippers, somewhat hidden in the Greek term Hyrcania. East of these were Baktrian Margianas, worshipping Mahā-Ar or M’-Argi, the early phalik Mars or spear-god of Arians, and after whom were named the Ar-tæ, the original name, says Professor H. H.

The high Asian stream was flowing about 3500 B.C., and was strong and increasing in volume between 3000 and 2000 B.C., and never ceased till about 400 A.C. It chiefly exhibited itself in huge waves occurring every 500 to 600 years, at our cyclic periods, when it usually swept all before it. There is nothing astonishing or miraculous in the movement; nothing requiring the intervention of the gods either of Judea, Asyria or Âs-ia, although all peoples spoke and prophesied like Jeremiah, and believed the ravaging hordes were curses sent by their deities. All however was mundane, and as orderly as our own streams of emigrants to the West and the Antipodes; only the Skuths could not travel by rail and steamers at the rate of some 300,000 per annum, so they waited till they numbered perhaps a million or two of hungry men, which their fatherland could no longer feed; and then, with wives and children, they set out on the war-path, determined to try their fortunes in the great unknown. We have shown from competent authors that the Aryan forte lay in language and latterly, in literature, not in art or construction, nor yet in the reasonable excogitation of a religion; this, the Aryan has too servilely accepted from his Turanian and Shemitik predecessors. He was at heart a spiritualist, and ever prone to deify the phenomena of earth and skies. For unknown centuries, as a nomad and herdsman, he worshipped the orbs above him and the spirits which seemed to throng his plains, trees, streams and forests; and refused to believe that these could be confined in a closed temple however gorgeous, or had delight in the singing, perfuming, shouts and processions practised in such places. He however gladly accepted hypethral shrines, as circles, groves, the secluded vale, or the cloud-capped mountain. The first Aryan temple was probably that at Selinus of about 626 B.C., which Greeks constructed after sundry lessons and en-samples from the Turano-Aithiopes. They had as a model the solo-phalik shrine of Corinth, built in 650 B.C. Not till 500 did Aryan Athens get her first temple to Egina, and some 50 years later that to Theseus, the old Teut, but here, an Olumpian Zeua. The Shemites of Asyria and Persia were earlier with their sculptured and painted palaces, but then their best “red,” or as we say, “blue blood” was the Turano, and then Sumiro-Akado, a lineage the Babylonian long prided himself on being de-scended from. At Persepolis and in Egypt the line of Kuros or Cyrus distinguished itself by building, but not through Aryans. Indeed Kambyses tried to signalize his reign by destroying temples, as that of the Amonium in Libya. Alexander was a diligent visitor of all holy places, and if he too wandered to the Libyan shrine, he also showed his true Aryan blood by climbing to the high summit of the holy mountain of Khorāsan, to revere its two sacred trees. After however, the sword had relaxed its violent rule the superiority of the Aryan race appeared; and we can console ourselves with the fact, that though the world lost much, which the old races had so nobly dis-covered and so enduringly enshrined in art, and even lost some real science, yet Aryans have recouped us with many virtues and a wealth of literature peculiarly their own.

But we must now proceed with the history of the Pelasgi, and that first form which Pelasgian Aryanism assumed in Southern Europe. THE PELASGI.—The correct or complete history of this people or congerie of tribes is probably for ever lost, but still we know a good deal. Niebuhr seems to have thought them autochthones, for he says they were an Asiatik race who “first peopled all the countries from the Bosphorus to Italy, including most of the Mediterranean islands, Northern Asia Minor,” and all Greece proper, Thrasia, llyrium and Tyr-rhenian Italy. He says they were “a firmly rooted, powerful and honourable people, who when Greece rose, dispersed in scattered fragments over all this vast space, as Kelts are in Spain.” The movements of “these sporadic tribes gave rise,” he thinks, “to the legends of their being great wanderers, as Herodotos describes them;” and hence the foolish etymology of some, that their name comes from Pelargoi, Storks, migrants, a plain, &c., or, “from the Keltik Felasgi,” signifying wanderers.1 The Rev. Geo. Faber and Millins, seem true to etymology and principle when they derive the name from the leading faith emblems of the race,2 as they do Palestine, Palli, &c., from Pallas, Hellenes from the Sun-God, and Ionians from their feminine cult. Of course all phalo-solar gods are “Wanderers,” “Coursers” and “Hunters,” but Pelasgi were called “Skythians of the South” who had ceased to wander, and Kelts were Northern Skuths, who were also settling down. Hesiod recognizes no one class or race in Pelasgi, stating that they are “a people gathered out of an the nations of the earth—great wanderers,” staying not even near to their holiest shrines, but forsaking their Thessalian Dodona for the high Delphian cleft, and that again for groves by the Dodonian lake of Epirus. They freely left Hellas to the pseudo Hellenes, but usually persisted in their own old faiths, in preference to all advancing cults. Clinton says their Asiatik kingdom began to decline between 1800 and 1900, one of our great cyclic epochs. Upon the next chime of that clock—about 1200, they were breaking up and moving on, fugitives before masses of disjointed Hellenik, Ionian and Karian peoples, but these epochs were otherwise important. The first or Her-metik Brâ or Brahma of ancient Brahma-Varta, was in 1800 B.C. paling before the new Vedik deities, and Zoroastrians about Balk were developing one of the purest of creeds. The Shemitik races who had partly absorbed and driven on these Turans, had now to try and withstand strong nations of Central Asian Aryans, who ever and again threw off colonies and armies, swift, destructive, and ably commanded. It required great skill and energy to turn aside into Europe their ever over-flowing surplus populations. But lest our reader be lost in this cloud-land of peoples, let us place them before him in a rough and tentative chronological order. 1 Vallencey, Col.

Crushing out of W. Turans. 549We have here endeavoured by sizing the type, to show the varying strength and volume of the first great primitive races. These form a large central triangle as it were; for the reader must imagine two lines to be drawn from the extremities of the upper names given to the leading stocks, which as regards Europe and the West, gradually close in upon the Turkish Turans. We thus see constantly waning Turanian races, and on the flanks, various and more multitudinous Shemitik and Aryan peoples, who gradually entered into their labors, and lost no opportunity of absorbing their weakened stragglers. From the Turans these got priests and teachers in mythology, religion, literature and art, and so rose in turn to be masters, which the type will assist the eye in observing. The primeval civilizers who, long before history can aid us, appear to have spread over a dark chaos—a light that everywhere lightened the nations, had from about 3000 B.C. begun to seriously contract; and at last we see them being squeezed out of national existence as the 6th century peal was chiming. Few of their old Allophylian tongues remain in Western Asia and S.E. Europe, where they so long reigned supreme, except in the case of new invaders, as Turks, &. ; and they too are now going, and would have gone sooner, but that they adopted the rising faiths, and were therefore protected by warring Aryans and Shemites, who by turns accepted and cast them aside. As Greeks taught, “no race knows its own genesis and still less the beginning of its language,” for to know this, it would require to know more, and thus there would be no “beginning.” Hence the learned were always sceptical about “the beginning of things,” and Greeks were therefore a progressive people, not desiring to bind the world in either their chronological or theological fetters. They listened complacently to Pliny plead-ing for 10,000 years as the lifetime of Zoroastrianism, and to Herodotos who asked twice this period for the birth of the Egyptian monarchy. From Thales, “glorying in his Phenician lineage” (Aithiopian),1 they accepted laws and government, and confessed that from his race they got arts and letters also; but they only smiled at the rambling tales which Jews, once their slaves and those of many peoples,2 urged upon them as to the genesis of the world, or man. They believed with Diodorus that “Asia was anciently governed by its own native kings of whom there is no history extant,” at leaat concerning 5000 B.C., the period the historian here alludes to. Yet Greeks carefully gathered up and magnified their own comparatively modern history, and utterly despised, nay destroyed or misrepresented all save that. It alone was correct, and all besides, were “mere myths concerning barbarous races,” whom it was not worth while to enquire much about. The reverse was true. The small Graikoi were of an unknown barbarous stock, which the daring physical deeds of a few able leaders brought into power; and the tribes heedlessly and from ignorance lost much of the science, arts and literature which then surrounded them. They did not indeed, owing very much to their inherent energy and being land and coast tribes, sink back in the race, but they took long to rise to the arts and learning which then existed on the adjoining 1 From Eruthræ came the Phoiniki, Edomi and Iberi.

They had capacity, if not for pure science, at least for art and all other civilization, and soon distinguished themselves in literature and as apt scholars of the great builders of Asia, but not in the science and astronomy which they found in the valleys of the Nile and Euphrates. They appropriated as their own, (and Europe, because such appears in aGreek garb has too freely granted the assump-tion), the Ionik and Dorik literature and architecture which preceded their birth as a nation. Neither Atika nor her tribes have however any more right to claim Orpheus, Museos, Olen, Linos, Kekrops, Kadmos, Thales, Puthagoras, nay, properly not even Homer or Hesiod—both Ionians—than ancient Ireland has to claim the literary merits of England, and England that of the adjoining continents.1 In time the tribes of the Aigaian seas and “Pelop’s isle” rose to the civilization which had flourished and declined several times in Phoinikia, Phrugia and Thrakê, ages before the Trojan troubles, and to these old Turanian and Shemitik civilizations, and not Greece, belonged “Thales the Phoinikian,” whom they called “The Father of Greek (!) philosophy,” Puthagoras of Samos, Archilochus, whom Greeks called “their (!) first poet,”2 Hekataios and Tyrtaios, both of Ionik Miletos. Nay, Herodotos himself belonged to this old home of early civilization, though he had adopted the rising nation and their classic language. Even the more or less Aryanized Ioni and Dori, who taught the Greeks architecture, had learned from the great Turans, whose constructive skill had set before them beautiful sample shrines in every land from lower Perses to the Pillars of Hercules. Greeks had these at the very doors of Athens, as in the temples of Hera at Samos, and of Diana at Ephesus, and others we yet know little of. Miletos belonged to an older than even Phoinikian or Ionik civilization. It is claimed as Lelegeis, but before Lelex it was called Pitusa and Anak-toria,3 which points to the old Aithiopian Beni-Anaks. Atika boasted that she got her literary language from the land where “burning Sapho loved and sung”—that Lesbian iland regarding the wine and women of which it was said, “who can match the Lesbiazein save the Kretizein.” Karia, Lydia and Golis gave to Homer and those who imitated him, that classic tongue of which Atika knew nothing till taught in their schools;4 and slowly it permeated to the ruder ilands and then to the mainland of the Greece of 700 B.C. And who gave Lesbos its language? Pelasgians, under some such chief as Xanthos, who according to legendary history preceded the Aiolii,5 who were a race following the leadership of the old Zeus of Argos, the son of Tri-ophis, that serpent Trinity sprung from the Eruthrean Poseidon and Larissa, words equivalent to Siva and Kunti.

According to the Old Testament chronology, Kekropians and Kadmians must have been causing most of the convulsions in the lands of Kanāns, Phoinikes, &c., about 2000 B.C., and this would be about the time when Diodorus says that Kadmos and Hermione his wife raised “Serpents’ teeth” and invaded Rhodes, &c., that is raised soldiers amongst Hivites, Hius or Heves, words meaning in Phoinikian and Hebrew dialects, “Serpents.” A prophetic vase was found in Rhodes, on which was written that the iland was to be destroyed by serpents, that is serpent worshippers. From the history and peoples of the Karian coasts. as given in the pages of Hero-dotos, who as a native and dweller on it should know best, we see that the earliest race were the Kaunii, who were probably the Hebrew Kanān or Canāans, that is the Eni or sons of Enos, whom Biblicists place at about 3000 B.C.2 They were succeeded here by Leleges and Kaukones, famous as soldiers and sailors, in the days of Minos King of Kretê. Following them came Pelasgi, and after them Karians. These were in time driven from the coasts by Dorians and Ionians,3 who in all seaports adopted, or perhaps we should rather say matured, the early Greek dialects, which they imparted to the less cultivated races of Peloponesia and Atika; under Karians, Miletus became again a great city.4 Karians, like the Greeks, are said to have come from the West, the former being fugitives from the Kukladian archipelago; for Thukudides relates5 that Karians were Kuklades whom Minos expelled. Homer in the above cited passage, called them Barbaro-phonon, and Strabo says they maintained their own language down to the Makedonian conquest, and were then occupying the interior of the country, and worshipping as their solar mountain god, a Zeus Chrusaoreus, and during Persian domination Zeus Stratios, in temples “purely Karian.”6 In 480 B.C. they assisted Xerxes with seventy ships, when Dorians only gave thirty. They never long acknowledged any Grecian influence, and the leaders and more conservative of them retired inland as the coasts became thronged or ruled over by foreigners. Greeks probably borrowed their early Zeus from the Jove of the Karian Stratonikea or Phrugian Ida, the natural Zion of all Pur-gi or Fire Worshippers. From Pausanias we learn that the Venus of all this Karian coast, was Artemis, who had been worshipped “from time immemorial” by Amazons, the predecessors of Leleges and Luds, Ruds or Lydians, and especially so on that rugged Tri-Opian 1 Cf.

Here, says Greek legend, the first colony from Atika landed in 1044 B.C. under Androklos, son of Kodros. On this headland the solo-phalik faith was both artificially and naturally fully represented, for the Pei-on, Pi-on or Pri-On,1 as they called “the oracle of the Sun,” was a highly symbolic rock which juts out into the sacred harbor of Pi-on or Koreaus, at the head of which was the holy fount of Hupelaios, sacred to the Asiatik Upsis or Ophis whom Greeks and later peoples called Artemis, and even Diana of Ephesus; a conical rock rising out of a basin close by a sacred fountain was the dual symbolism. Aryan Kymri ravaged her shrine, indeed all Karia, in the 7th century B.C., but it was quickly re-erected, mostly through the influence of Krœsus, who bestowed upon it scores of valuable columns and some golden bulls—indispensable in this worship. Herr Curtius ascribes the foundation, of Artemesian worship to Karians and Phenicians, the builders of the Heræum of Samos their “Sun-isle,” and the Artemesium of Ephesus. They would be teachers of Greeks at Delphi when there rearing their shrine to the Keltik Apolo; but it is hard to regain lost history, and especially when we are foiled as here, by Greek egotism and pride. The rise of Greek racial wars and brigandage shows a distinct suspension of pro-gress and civilization, though the quickness and energy of the race enabled them to rise and in time surpass their masters.2 Thukudides says that the Pelasgi were “a numerous and very widely spread people before the age of Hellen, son of Dukalion the Skuthian;” and these Skuths, said Berosius, “were learned in all the arts, and early distinguished as a lettered people;” but they were very far from being autochthones in any land. They found Italy peopled by Enotrians, that is, under a leader Œnotrus, when they went there from Arkadia about 1800 B.C. Some said Italy was so called after the Pelasgian King, Italus, who succeeded their Morgetus, but the Tyrrhenians were found there with Sikuli, Sikani, Liguri and Umbri, all probably of Kutho-Turan stocks, and Nature worshippers with Tur or Tower emblems. The same obtained in Spain among Ibers and Basks—not yet Aryanized, for they too came from the old Eruthrean stock, see foot-note, p. 549 ante. It is no more correct to-day, to state that Europeans are the Aryans of ancient high Asia, than to call the Hindu-Aryan a European. We have lost and are ever losing all purity of race and old Aryan blood, nay, this is not even our own chief element.3 So Pelasgians finally succumbed or became absorbed in the Turseni, Sikuli, &c., and these in turn have been overrun ever and again by Kelts, Skuths, Etrurians, Truski, &c., whose civilization had a Cushite or Aithiopian foundation, modified by the land and age they lived in; for, as elsewhere pointed out, these Cushites colonized Italy about 3000 B.C., and their commercial and peaceful civilization as developed by Turseni 1 Polynesians of Kuthite extraction still call the Phallos, Pi-em, Pi-en, Pin, or Pi-Am, see Art. in Jour.

No doubt all peoples believed in Elf spirits; and Elves, generally considered to be “Little Folk,” were a strongly recognized body in England; Elf = Alf, and Alpa = “little” in Sanskrit, while Alphito is in Greek “a Spectre,” and Elbiz meaning a swan in German, is much connected with Elves and Albus, whiteness; nevertheless the etymology of Pliny here most commends itself to us, and he wrote, “Albion insula sic dicta ab albis rupibus quas mare alluit.” At the Oriental Congress held at Florence, 1879, Signor Fabiani and others argued that the site of Rome must have been occupied long before Latins arrived, and by Kutho-Egyptians or Keftro-Egyptians or Phenicians, Pelasgians, &c.; for remains have been discovered of these peoples, nay of Egyptian divinities. Nor have their symbolisms even yet died out, in the most holy places of the old city, as “the great stone,” the Bocca della verita or “oracle of Covenant or Truth,” in the portico of the church of S. Maria in the Cosmedin, still bears witness. Into this Yoni or mouth the swearer must still thrust his hand, which, if he has sworn falsely, will be bitten off! Most Hesiodik and Homerik writers and scholiasts, looked upon Thrake as the home of the Pelasgi, and its Don or Zeus of Dodonaas their chief god—the Dodonik Pelasgike, as Achilles termed him. The Athenian plain was “the Argos of Pelasgia,” and swarmed with this race, and their phalik shrine or Pelasgikon was the first oracle we know of on the Akropolis of Athenê. It was Pelasgi who first walled in the famous city—taught by their Kuklopian brethren, as they alone could do this. Here, says Herodotos, they observed their Egyptian faith and rites in days when Greeks were emerg-ing from Kekropidæ, Erechtheidæ, Iones, &c., all of whom however were but mongrel tribes of the same great Aithiopik family, more or less mixed with northern Kelts or Skuths. As the local tribes welded together, the purer Pelasgi departed or interbred with, and settled down as Pelasgian Ægialeans or “Pelasgians of the coast,” Aiakidians, Arkadians, Argolians, Peloponesians, &c. The 7th and 8th century “Greeks” were really Achaians, Kaukones, Aiolidai, Dorians, Adorians, Argives, Ionians, Yonas or Yavanas, as principally called in the East even to these days; and though as Graikoi, ignorers of caste, for they had none to lose, they were looked upon as holding very much the same faiths as the Pelasgi. Their sacred circle singers or Kuklik poets were but the outcome of the Pelasgian Kuklidi.2 Homer only knew Greeks as Achaians, and he knew of no Hellen or Doros as persons, but only Hellenes or Solarists as a people of Thessaly, and Doreans as an obscure Kretan race.3 Thukudides knew of no Greeks called Hellenes, though 1 Pre-Historic Nations, p. 374. 2 Journ.

Thukudides1 speaks of the Tursenoi of Italy as having been the “autochthones of Atika,” and of the same stock as the Hetrurians. There it appears they worshipped the sun as Zen, Zan and Ain, the eye or “well of heaven.” It is said they came from Lud or Lydia by command of an oracle which cried to them— “ Haste to the realms of Saturn, shape your course Where Kotule’s fam’d island wandering floats On the broad surface of a sacred lake;” that they peopled many lands with Ruds or Rhodians, Turseni or Etrurians on their way, and forgot not their “wandering Delos,” to which and to “the navel of Italy,” they gave a tithe of all their gains.2 In some portions of Greece the Pelasgi were termed Bisaltes, Crestones and Edones; and in Italy and several ilands, as Lemnos, they were Tyr-rheni. In the Peliponesos they were called Dorians, of whom the most famous in Grecian times were the Lakedaimones, whom Pezron calls Kelts. In the Makedonian mountains they were Barbari, who were refused admittance to that Paradise, the Olumpik games.3 Their earliest abode was around the base of Pelium, Ossa and Olumpos, centres of mountain worship and of many mythologies, where had lived those Kaldian-like heretics who “piled Ossa upon Pelium to scale Olumpos.” Pelium was the northern home of Ken-taurs or bull-worshippers, and of Cheiron, the instructor of Achilles, whose sacred caves were there; that of the latter on the saddle between the two peaks, and that of the former, on the summit beside the temple of Zeus Aktaios. The old capital of Pelasgik Makedonia was Pella, famous for the worship of Minerva, who was adopted by all Aryan peoples. Pellene, one of the most ancient of the twelve Achaian cities, was founded, said its inhabitants, by the giant Pallas, whom Argives called Pellen—probably Pi-Ellen. Its favourite deities were Apolo, Demeter, and rude forms of Ath-Or or Ath-ena. Thus from many sources we may trace the Greek name Pelasgi to the God or oracle of the people, their Pel-eus, P’El-theus or Pi-el, a demi-god or patriarch like to the Peleg or “Divider” of Genesis, a sufficiently phalik term. The Greek language and Pelagos, “the Sea,” are too modern to give us the real name of this ancient people, but Pelagos or Pontos, the “Sea-God born of the earth and without a father,”4 is a good description of these wondrous “Sea Kings,” who founded nations everywhere. Many writers identify the Pelasgi with Dorians, Etruskans, the busy trading Kadmonites, Kanans and Phenicians,5 and Bishop Marsh and Gallæus show they were the Dori who founded Dora near Karmel, 1 Thukidides, I. 3, V. 109.

There they were devoted worshippers of groves, pillars and stones in circles, a faith which continued strong all throughout these coasts well down into Mahamadan times, and of which abundant remains still exist. Ceres was the consort of their Pelasgus, and Isis, their Pelasgia; and the maritime portion of the people had an oceanik mythology, clearly the parent of the Greek one, showing the relations of the earth and sky-gods with Okeanos. Greeko-Ionim would imitate Pelasgi in building a Lars, omphe, ark or akropolis, in the centre of their cities; and those inclining to Sivaism would adopt Lingams or such like natural features in conical hills, rocks or tsurs, to symbolize their Heraklian ideas. It is these, and no mythical leaders as Tursen or “Tur, the grandmother of Nestor,”1 who gave to these great Tur builders their names. Tur is the Pillar God of Fire or Light, in T’U r, Ta-Ur or Toth-Ur, and passed into Oceana as Tu, Du, Deo, A-Tu, A’tua, as the solar stone symbol of the Kutho-Polynesian Creator.2 Some authors trace Pelasgos from Poseidon and Larissa, names peculiarly sexual and mythical; and it is correctly urged that these names invariably indicate a Pelasgik and Phoinik, and therefore Aithiopik element. The people thronged Samothraké, Lemnos, Imbra, and all the ilands of the Kukladian and Aigaian seas, which indeed Thukudides calls Pelasgian, and identifies with Kuk- ladian.3 The Kuklades called all the iles around and about Chios, “Holy Delos,” and Sura or Syra (this conical mount, and so expressive of their faith), their “Charmed Circle,” and they shared with Pelasgi and all others in a fervent mountain cultus. The Pelasgik Pylos, Pulos or Pi-el of Peleus, is repeated in names and traditions wherever the people long dwelt. A Pylos looked down on sacred Daphne, which Romans knew as Pi-erus, and the Pylos of Elis and its myths are the foundations of much Greek mythology. According to Hesiod and Diod. Sic. it was the Pelasgik Xanthus who, from his capital at Argos, established sacred Skuros, Skiathos, Lesbos and Lukia, in the days when the Greek Zeus arose as a chief God; and Xanthus called Zeus his Zuth or Zi-ut, learning this from the Zi-An of the old Akads. Let us look at their old Peloponesia,n sites and teachers. The descendants of Ion and Xuthus were Pelasgi, who had adopted the rites and faith of the old founders of Tiryns or Tiruns—those ancient Turano Aithiopes, whose first Tyr was opposite Bahrien on their Eastern Eruthrean Sea, and their second on “the Sea of Kuth,” as the Eastern Mediteranean used to be called. The Egyptians knew them in the days of Rameses IV. of the 20th Dynasty, say 1150, as still ruling along the coasts of both the Eruthreans and on the African sea-board.

Mukenê, adjoining Turh or Tiruns, with its “Gate of Lions” and fine polygonal Kuklopian masonry, was clearly the work of Aithiopo-Pelasgi, and very like the structures of their brethren at Cosa, Signia and Fiesole in Tursenian Italy. According to Grote, the divine or heroic pedigree of the rulers of Mukenê, Argos and Arkadia, starts, 1st, with PELASGOS king of Argos, son of Zeus and Niobe, 2d, with their son LUKAON of about 2000 B.C. (say 18 generations prior to the Trojan war), and 3d, with ŒNOTUS his son, the great colonizer. But according to Dion. Halic., the first Pelasgian colonist of Arkadia was “Atlas, son of Ia-petus, and brother of Prome-theus, a Caucasian,” and therefore a Caucasian Aithiope, and belonging to the time of Osiris and the Old Testament Ham of the 25th century B.C. Arkadia was anciently called Pelasgia, and Dion. Halic. affirms, that the Pelasgi were seated in Argos six generations before they went to Emonia. At Argos they worshipped Ceres or Isis, and were held to have been autochthons of the Peloponesos. Mukenê, celebrated in Greek literature as the capital of Agamemnon and the most ancient city of Argolia, existed evidently before Argos, at least it flourished before Dorians had made Argos a capital, or the Eruthrio-Heraklidæ had returned to their Peloponesian fatherland. Homer seemed to think that the city was named from Muchō, “a recess,” for it is hidden in a very retired valley of the Lukean range. But great cities are more usually called after great deities, and so we find “the goddess of the Abyss or Recess” was here more especially worshipped. Hera was “the tutelary divinity both of Mycenê and Tiryns . . . . and Juno is identical with the Pelasgic Moon and Cow goddess Io, with the Beōtian goddess Demeter Mycalessia, and with the Egyptian moon goddess Isis;”2 and accordingly, the indefatigable explorer of ancient Troy (in his preliminary excavations at Tiryns, or as Lepsius properly prefers to call it Turris or Turh), unearthed eleven terra-cotta figures of cows and nine female figures, thus described by him. They are painted red, black and yellow; have ornaments, “very compressed faces” (perhaps like the ancient dark Turanians, and many of the present rather squat- faced Southern Indians), “no mouth, and a ‘polos’ on the head; the breasts are in high relief, and below them protrude two long horns, as though typifying the crescent moon or horns of a cow, or both at the same time. Similar cows and idols were found at Mukenê two or three years back, which city is near the great Heræon, and celebrated for its cultus of Juno. . . . . A terra-cotta figure was also found with its hands crossed on its breast, the uncovered head of which resembled a bird,” an important emblem in ancient as well as modern faiths, and that by which the “Holy,” “hot” or fiery Spirit is often represented, see pages 225, 226, and other parts of our first volume.

It was she who chose Apolo to guard her gate, and in her shrine did mythic story make that valiant chief fitly spring, whose life if not name was one of love and passion. Perseus was the founder of Mukenê, the Pelopidæ its devoted inhabitants, and Agamemnon its Grecian king. The building of the present Kuklopian walls of Mukenê2 and Turis, are commonly said to have taken place about 2000 B.C., but we may perhaps assign their foundations to an earlier period, when the Akadian builders of Kaldia were moving westward. The Argives are said to have seized and destroyed the city in 468 B.C., and from then till 1200 A.C. Tiruns or Turis is little heard of, and Strabo says that no vestiges of Homer’s Mukenê, existed in his day, but a new city with Makedonian remains. J. P. Mahaffy considers 468 B.C. as far too modern a date for its destruction; the remains lately discovered, point he says, to some period prior to the 6th century B.C.3 Turis is said to have been the name of the son of Argos. but the founder was Proitos, who was changed into a block of stone by means of Medusa, on account of his conduct towards Danaê, the daughter of Akrisios. When restored to his kingdom by Io-bates, he founded shrines to Hera and Apolo. The Tirynth was called the Heræum,4 but we see from the founder being “a block of stone,” that a Linga or Mahadeva was the real god of the Heræum. The solar Perseus was a subsequent form of the faith, for “according to the common tradi-tion, Mega-penthes, the son of Proitos, ceded Tiryns to Perseus, who transmitted it to his descendant Electryon,” who was the grandfather of HerakIes by his daughter Alkmena, who married Amphitryon. Herakles was called Tiryn-theus and Eruthrus, and the Achaians stuck to their favourite Turis, long after the return of the Herak-lidæ and the conquest of the Peloponesos by the Dorians. Tiruns is held, owing to the greater rudeness of its architecture, to be several centuries older than Mukenê; around both sites the ground is strewn with “Phenician pottery.”5 M. Lenormant identifies the terra-Cotta cows as rude representations of the Artemis Nanèa of Babylonia, and thinks “the male divinity” found beside her may have also come from there, he having a long Asyrian beard. Dr Schliemann and others found also grotesque figures of women, reminding us of such rude and coarse old Keltik figures as the one we show on page 291, which was found buried “at the base of the Round Tower at Cashel.” It is an emblem of female nature like “the Grove” of the Scriptures, 1 Smith’s Dict. of G. and Ro.

Mr Rivett Carnac calls attention to the “whorls, disks and polished balls found at Hisarlik being precisely the same as those found amid the ancient Indian remains of the Fatégarh district of upper Bengal.”2 There are also found coins or stamps denoting Tree, Bull and Serpent worship, with the Svastika cross on altars; and tripods or branching candlesticks rising over Lingam-like stupas or temples, like the Budhist stupa shown as No. XII. of our fig. 253, p. 268. Figures of Lions, Rams, and even Elephants have been found at Mukenê and Tiruns, showing a widely-travelled people. All point to the Westem Kushis being probably brethren to the Kusis of ancient Benares or Kasi, and indeed it is acknowledged that the Mukene remains are strikingly like those of the old Kuthites of Kaldia and Arabi Irāk.3 Near to the tomb of the supposed “three kings and three women, were found golden suns, horned Junos, silver and bronze cowheads, ivory beehives, buttons covered with gold and elaborately carved with spiral lines, or that curious Cross with the mark of four nails, which so frequently occurs on the whorls of Ilium,” and which Dr. Schlie-mann “believes to be the symbol of holy fire.” Beehives represent Venus, and bees are the arrows on the string of the bow of Kami, the Indian Goddess of Love. The nails though appropriated to Christ are old Sivaik emblems, as we have elsewhere shown in the case of Maltese and Etrurian crosses,4 and see Dr Inman’s Pagan and M. C. Symbolism, pages 36, 53, 86, 101 and 134. Some races favored the four nails and four yoni ideas, but Christians preferred the Trinitarian form, as Sivaites do in the Tri-sul (“three nails”) of their Lord. The Jews put their nails or Yods, with a Kamets or Tau into a circle, which was then the all-embracing figure of unity, Tyyy, and therefore of the godhead. The Yod, y, they said was not only the first letter in their own name and that of Jehovah, hwhy, Yahu-ê (the Yahu), but the Divine “Hand” or Yad and “the tenth or perfected number,” the Tetragrammaton and “a sign for God the incomprehensible One.”5 The Yod also appears “in the Phenician and Samaritan alphabets, and on Maccabean coins, under the rude image of the hand”—Maha-deva’s emblem of potentiality. The “Place,” “Pillar” or Lingams of Absalom and Saul were Yads or “Hands,” because these were worshipped as representing Yahuê;6 and the Hebrew letter Shin of three Yods (or nails united by a Cross or Kamets) was the special sacred emblem of Jewish philakteries. The Sivaik Trisul is but the junction of the three Yods, which then constitute the Maltese or Etrurian-like cross, see fig. 26 of Inman’s Symbolism, p. 86. Fig. 130 of this author is as he says, the emblem “of Cupid” or “Saint-Desire,” and synonymous with le dard, or la pique, whilst fig. 131 is the nail again, as Tor’s hammer, “le marteau qui frappe l’enclume et forge les enfans.”7 1 Keane’s Towers and Temples of Ireland, p. 33. 2 Jour.

Of course there was a Meru, Zion or holy mountain near to Mukenê and it was sacred to Helios, which ignorant Christians took to mean their Elias, the Jewish Seer of solo-phalik proclivities. It lies to the north, and its modern name is Mount Agios Elias. On its summit is traced a small triangle with a base of thirty-five feet facing the east, where was the gate. It is still surrounded by well built Kuklopian walls, within which. says Dr. Schliemann, is “an open chapel sacred to the prophet Elias, but where in ancient days must have existed a temple of great sanctity and immense importance. . . . . The name probably denotes the deity who was venerated here.” All neighboring Christians still resort to this shrine in times of drought to invoke Elias for rain, as other sects invoked Indra and Jupiter Pluvius. But to return to the Pelasgi, who were here the second diligent builders and worshippers. With reference to their early settlements in Thessaly, Thukudides says they first colonized this province on its being converted from a vast lake into fertile plains, in the far back days of their patriarch Pelasgos. It was his Sabine son Oinōtros who founded Oinōtria in southern Italy “seventeen generations before the Trojan war,” (say 1900 B.C.), turning out a people, say Pausanias and others, called the “Sicels” of course some very early branch of the Sikuli and great Saturn worshippers. In Umbria, the Pelasgi founded such cities as Larissa, Phalerium, Fescinia, Saturnium and Pisa, in which last they had one of their sacred Turs, the predecessor no doubt of the modern leaning tower. They had a shrine to their Hera at Falerium, like that at Argos, with similar rites and sacrifices. At both, priestesses or “Canephori and choruses of maidens,”2 offered up to solo-phalik gods the first born of man and beast, and the first fruits of the fields. The people are described “as a warlike race, greatly skilled in naval matters,” and in consequence were, like our north men of the Middle Ages, constantly invited by other nations to fight their battles. Even Rome, say several authors, was built by Pelasgian Tur-rheni, who used here to celebrate their great Saturnalia, of which our carnival fetes are the remnant. Picenum and Hercula-nemn were all founded by Pelasgi, yet in time the great race here became mere vassals or Italiots. Dionysius says the Pelasgi left in great bodies, and he thinks that it was only remnants of them “who in conjunction with the aborigines” built 1 Prideaux’s Art. already quoted, and our vol.

Eastern Aborigines. 560Rome; but few writers refer here to. others than Pelasgi, and Cato calls these “the Aborigines,” and identifies them with “Achaians or Pelasgik Greeks.” Pliny says “writing was brought into Latium by Pelasgi,” and this is confirmed by others. Orpheus, Homer and the early poets of course used the Pelasgian or some form of the Phoinikian letters, if indeed they wrote at all. Niebuhr and K. O. Muller insist that all words truly common to Greek and Latin are Pelasgian, and Herodotos calls this a Thrakian and no Greek tongue. It was Pelasgi more than Greeks, says Mr Gladstone, who gave Rome her religion,1 and whose language supplied all the spiritual and elementary wants of a busy and industrious people. Lukaōs the son of Pelasgos, introduced the Lukaian games, and the Lukaian Jove was Pan in the days when faith was centred in the sacred Pelasgikon of the Akropolis of Athens, and in the phalik shrines of Samothrake, Troy and Pale or ancient Tyre. And who so famous for games and all manly pursuits as the old Phoinakes? They instituted horse games as sacred to their Poseidon, at all their great centres and several generations before the Troika,2 but we more especially hear of them in Thessaly and about Marthus. The Aiolids, the Danāns of the Nile and Greece, and the Tuath de Danāns of Ireland were all Phenicians, Mr. Gladstone thinks, and their “Aiolos, guardian of the winds,” that is of their coasts, instituted the horse games of Elis, ages before a Greek nation was dreamt of.3 Wherever, says this writer, “Homer mentions solid building or the use of hewn or polished stone, it is always in some relation to the Phenicians. . . . The wall of Troy was built by Poseidon, the Phenician god, that is by Phenecian artizans;” so was the Trojan palace of Priam, and the temple of polished stone dedicated to Kirkê, the Phenician goddess. The term “Pelasgi” is often found applied to those Beni-Anaks or Phoinikes who resided inland or were engaged in agriculture. We know that Phoinikian nations dwelling on the Nile coasts were variously called Kaphtors and Danāns, and Northerly, Palashts, Turians, Surians, Kheti, &c. So Greeks were only known to Asyrians as Yavnans or Yunans, and the whole people of Western Asia were in India designated Yâvanas, although that name properly belonged originally only to the Ionis or Yavans, and in the time of Sargon, to the inhabitants of Cyprus.4 Thus many of those we call Pelasgi were offshoots of the old stocks of Phoinikes, Kephts, Anaktori, &c., and such branches had therefore descended through Shemito-Aithiopes; whilst the history, architecture, rites and worship of other Pelasgi, show that they too were brethren but with strong Aryan tendencies. Both must have started from the same creative centre but at a wide interval, and been subjected to entirely different influences of climate and surroundings. Kadmeans were, it is said, people “coming from the East,”5 though this is 1 Juventus Mundi, Introd.

They said he cast fire into the sacred grove of the Apolonik serpent of Boiótia, meaning that he added Fire-worship to that of the Python, but inasmuch as he was a Toth and Hermes in the best attributes of letters and learning, so Greeks had to thank him for that all-enduring fire, which a personified Kadmos or Achad-ams3 generated in the groves of their Achademus or Academy, and which has ever since fired and enriched with cultured thought all the civilised world. Mr Gladstone notices the Achaian name as peculiarly one of feminine gender, and that Homer called the Dorieis of Kreté, Achaians,4 as well as Anakeians and Athenians, saying that they observed the same faith rites, especially during their Castor and Pollux fetes, and this connects all these with the Kuklopes who were Kadmes or Achadames.5 According to Strabo, the Thessalian Pelasgi, Achaians or Phthiotes, first came to the Peloponesos with Pelops, son of Tantalos, and seizing Lakonia, gave to it the name of Achaiak-Argos; when forced onwards, they drove out the Ionim from Aigialos, which henceforth was called Achaia, and thus in process of time they became known as Aigialeians, Arkadians, Argeioi, &c. These would be no longer Ionim, or the Left hand sects, (Vishnuites), but Turseni or Tur builders, virtually Sivaites. We see clearly that there were here “Right” and “Left hand Sects,” for there were Beth-El and Ionim worshippers, but, just as in India, in face of a common enemy all antagonism of sects subsided, for we see Ach-illeus, a Thessalian—boastfully called the grandson of Ai-ak-os, a “son of the Sun,” and Peleión, son of Peleus—leading all sects of Achaians, Hellenes,6 &c. to Troy. Both commanders and commanded are termed Achaians and Argeiana, not Greeks, whilst the instructors of the Aryanized line of Achilles were Cheiron and his associates of the old Aithiopo-Beni-Anak stocks. The half mythical history of the Thessalian son of Peleides is evidently a Greek para.phrase of the story of Pelias of Iolkos, the son of the Aithiopian deities Poseidon and Turo; and the wars of the Troas, though to some extent true, are also embellished from the myths of Melkarth. Peleus of Mount PeIion (a solarized Pi-El-idea), when affianced to Thetis, the daughter of Cheiron, “lost his sword at night,” says the 1 Bryant and Holland’s Mythologies, p. 62. 2 Ibid., p. 34. 3 Ibid., p. 84. 4 Juventus Mundi, pp. 64-67, 143, 144. 5 Bryant and Holland’s Mythologies, p. 105, and elsewhere. 6 Juventus Mundi, p. 65.

Like Siva, the asetik, and the legendary Joseph, Peleus refused the seductive entreaties of his host’s wife, when he won her admiration as conqueror in the games of Iolkos; and like all solar gods, Heaven or Hephaistos furnished him with weapons wherewith to overthrow the Ken-taurs or Bull worshippers of Pelion; but he was turned into a stone and his followers into wolves, which seems to de-scribe a temporary failure of Solarism about Pelion, and the triumph of a pure stone or Lingam worship. This, too, may be a Western reduplication of the old Turano-Akadian Bull wars, illustrated in our fig. 207, vii., p. 77. The Homerik leader has many of the characteristics of the old Turanian solar heroes. Achilles was “a child of golden locks and of fire;” “Lord of War, of Sacrifice and of Healing” (the Ier-u-Sălem idea); “swift of foot,” a “Driver and hunter,” as were all solar gods. Like Bar-Chus, Krishna and Moses, he rose from the waters, and would have been immortal but for one weak point; not like Sams-On, in his hair, but like Krishna, in his heel; and like this Apolo also, he fell in his Dvāra or door, “the Skean Gate” of the holy circle of his Ilium; not, however, before he had “passed through” his twelve labors, the destruction of twelve towns, and captured Hektor or Ak-tor, and thrown his body at the foot of Priam—all sufficiently phalik explications. His remains were deposited as became a Sun god, in a golden urn, and as became a chief of solo-phalists, on a huge conical Omphe or Tomba, overlooking the valley of the holy Skamander, the burning sources of which rise amid the snows of Ida, his Zion and that of many peoples. Greeks adopting an Aithiopian tradition regarding Phoinikes capturing certain women from Inachus of Argas, amongst whom was Io, said it was their hero god Zeus who carried off the representative bovine Mother, the priestess of Hera (a name of Vishnu who we found in Turano-Akadia), and whose form is largely represented amidst the remains of Mukenê and the Troas. Phoinikians said that Io voluntarily fled with them on finding herself with child by the captain of their vessel.1 Amphion and Zethos, “the Jasonites,” who were, said Greeks, the first to found and wall in Thebes “four or five generations before the Troika,” were Pelasgians who had been expelled from Boiōtia by Kadmes and Phoinikes, long before there is any “evidence of an Hellenic race or family.” Even the very name of Iasos or Jason, continues Mr Gladstone, “appears to bear no Hellenic character, though it has certain points of contact”2 with races who dwelt in Egypt and Phoinikia. Jason we find to be descended from the old Aithiopian God Poseidon, through his famous son Peleus, whose daughter by the Aiolian Kretheus, bore Jason, Pheres and Amythaon, marking the early alliance of Turans and Aryans.

We of course see in it a faith-term like the word Arkadians or Athenians, and agree, as he urges, that is probably lies in Akads, who, half Aryanized and Shemitized about the time of the Trojan convulsions, had spread all over Persia, Asia Minor and onwards. He sees Achaians in “the Persian Archai Menidai,”1 who were flourishing in S.W. Armenia in the reign of Shalmanezar lI., or 9th century B.C.; to which we assent, but prefer the old faith-term of Ach-meni, as designating them “Men of Ach” or solarists; for we know that mene was man, an obelisk, and the sign of a man, or of the sun, in fact the Māné of Ad-māne, the Adām of many races. Eusebius speaks of Pelasgi as contemporaries of Solomon, and as being long before and after his time, the terror of all coasts, and, as Tur-rhenoi, called “Sea demons.” The colonies of Danans which went from the Egyptian coasts to Argos about 1400 B.C. are variously called “Pelasgi, Pelasgiotides, Lars and Larissas,” but this was by no means their first visit to Argos. Mr. Gladstone says the Danai “found there a primitive Pelasgian population,” that is Kuklopes, Kabiri, Kuths, and other old Aithiopian races.2 The early Aphrodite of the Peloponesos was Kuthereia, the consort no doubt of a patriarchal Kuthus or Kuttarus. We have seen that Keftors and other Egyptian coast, if not interior tribes, were Pelasgi; in fact, as Bishop Thirlwall says,3 “the name ‘Pelasgians’ was only a general one like that of Saxons, Franks and Ale-mani, each of the tribes having also a name peculiar to itself.” So Niebuhr insists upon “Pallas being only a Hellenized deity,” and thus those known to Greeks, as Hellenes, Argives, Arkadians and Ionians, had grown out of Pelasgians. To this Mr. Gladstone agrees, so that the name of this people was a faith-term like that of “Hindu” or “Christian.” It was only the ignorance of the Graikoi which called the race “Autochthones.” and the ignorance of the old tribes which made them speak of Thessaly as “their cradle land,” and Olumpos as the primeval Zion of their Zuth. They told Greeks that his winter retreat had always been in Epirus, amidst the groves of Dodona, by the sweet lake of Io or Ioan-nina; and that “the deep loamed Larissa” by the river and lake of Peneus, was his Arkite capital. Homer said he was “ The Pelasgian Jove, parent of gods and men; King of Dodona and its hallowed grove.” This Pelasgian faith was exactly such as always ripened into Hellenism. The great Kuthite races of Babylon so matured it on the Persian Gulf and the mountains of Ellams or Hellenists; and here in Europe were little colonies of Graici about to develope and make it immortal in the sculptures, statuary and learning of Atika. But to do this on that hard and sterile land, the refuge of pirates and all restless 1 Juventus Mundi, p. 310.

There were no doubt two sects, as Euripides never alludes to Ion as Hellenik, nor does the Hesiodik tradition of Hellen and his sons ever mention Ion, who is only known as the adopted son of Xouthos. Demeter of Eleusis was the great deity of all Atika; for, says Strabo, “Atika was Io’s, with an Ionian people;”3 and the Ionian name, according to Juv. Mundi, was certainly not Hellenic, or in origin connected with the same; nor “are the associations of Demeter in Homer, ever Hellenic.” Of course not; which of us would think of calling a Sivaite a Vishnu-ite, though both are Hindus and have Brahman leaders? regarding all which see our Vol. I., pp. 306-16, and Index headings under Pi, Pierians, Pigilians, &c. On page 298 of that Vol., we dwelt upon the faith-meanings in Pala and Peleg, “the Divider” and “Distinguished One,” an etymology noticed by Mr Gladstone, and which he seems to accept in urging that Greece was anciently Pelasgia, and the faith, one based “upon the worship of nature powers.”4 Pelas was in point of fact “Siva, born of the mountains,” the Elohim of a Gan-Eden, or a Yahuê of nomads. It was Pelasgos, said these tribes, who taught men to clothe themselves and live on fruits, and to sacri-fice to the gods. He was “the beauty of holiness,” excelling all in magnitude and strength, and the great creative power which clothed the world with soil and verdure, said both poets and statesmen. “ Black earth on lofty mountains thick with leaves God-like Pelasgos once produced; that thence A mercenary nation might arise.”5 Pelasgos is thus a Mahadeva, as Hindus would name such a God, and the Pelasgoi who fought at Troy called themselves the sons of Teutamos. Larissê, says Mr Gladstone, as “mentioned in the Trojan Catalogue, appears once more, and on both occasions as an epithet denoting fertility;”6 a fact we have long since particularly dwelt upon in the Lares and Penates of all tribes; for Larissê was the Ionê, as the Penates was the Beth-Lechem or Corn God, the Tent, Ti-uth or Pi-el-eus, of the early progressive Western Aithiopes. They called their chiefs after their gods, as which of us have not? but this must not deceive us into mistaking a chief for the original god-source, nor because we find Turanian peoples adopting Shemitik or Aryan languages, should we fancy that they had never been Turanian.

We know that the Selli or Helli were the priests of Dodona, and that Curiales or Curetes were servants of the high Asian “God of Light,” Kur, Kures or Ka-Ur, and that Pelasgi gave these Salli or Curia to Romans. The ancient races of Akar-An-ia, Ait-ol-ia and Eubea, were called Curetes and Helliadæ, and Curetes nursed (or were the originators of) the later Zeus, their modified Kur, Ur or Uranus,4 and of the Zi of Arkadia. It is clearly shown in regard to the eight books of the Odyssey—probably not composed till the 7th cent.—that “Greek experience could not have supplied them. and that Phenician could;”5 and Greeks, it is admitted, “were apt pupils of Phe-nicians ever since the time of Minos, the first known founder of a maritime empire, and the mythological son of Zeus.” We know that from the Theban Kadmenian Phoinikes, (settled, says Homer, all over Boiótia a generation before the Troika), Greeks got both letters and civilization. In Corfu or Scherie and neighboring ilands, the old civilizers went by many names, as Phaiakes, Nausiclutoi, or “famous sailors,” &c.; and one of their great kings was Proitos, “Monarch of all Argeioi, and of the well-walled city of Tiryns.” Of him and his celebrated mythical queen-goddess Anteia. we have many strange solo-phalik tales, and that told by Greeks regarding her love for Beler-ophon is probably a variant of the Pelean story and the origin of the Jewish legend of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife.6 It is clear that the gross parts of the Grecian faith which, it is said, came from Egypt to Pelasgia, and so to Greeks, became grosser according as the soil on which the faith fell became poorer. Yet there is not much to choose between “the vibrating images” of Egypt, the erect Elean Lingam of Kullenê, as described by Pausanias,7 and the Athenian erections; and it is not fair to mislead the public as so many orthodox authors do, by upholding one side of Grecian Religion, or “The Olym-pian System,” as Mr Gladstone calls this, and keeping back the other side, or the worship of Fertility. Let us tell the whole or conceal the whole, so that no such false 1 Juventus Mundi, p. 115. 2 So a glutton was called a Phaiax, because Phaiakes were rich, and fond of feasts and gaiety. 3 Juventus Mundi, pp. 29-37. 4 Cf. our Vol. I. p. 392; Bryant’s Mythologies, I. p. 40, II. p. 472; Holwell, p. 135. 5 Juventus Mundi, pp. 118, 128, 130. 6 Details in our Glossary. 7 Paus., II. 145; Herod.

Gradually Greece acquired “a real as well as universal religion,” says our author;1 one which “acted upon life, menaced the excesses of power; prescribed the duties of reverence to age and authority; of hospitality to the stranger, and of mercy to the poor. It had one and the same standing with reference to all classes. It did not assign to deity that most ungodlike quality, respect of persons (and was thus superior to the Hebrew ‘System’). But in after times, apart from its moral stains, it became wholly severed from the cultured mind (as all faiths tend to), and subsisted mainly as the jest of philosophers and men of the world, the tool of priests and rulers, the bugbear of the vulgar.” Christians very seldom realize how much this is the case with Christianity to-day. There is not, says Mr Gladstone “in the true Olympian religion any clear instance of a married deity, except Zeus,” and this is also the case in the Hebrew, though the Elohim of Genesis has his Ruach, and Jehovah, a female “Holy Spirit,” which Europe now calls male. So “there is no patronymic among the gods, except that of Zeus him-self, and (mark here how Christianity follows the older religion) there is no god, born of any divine sire other than Zeus, nor any god, born of a goddess, except he be the father, nor any god, born of a human mother;”: a Christian departure which enabled Mahamadans to drive Christianity with ease and rapidity out of Asia and Africa, and which is still enabling Islam to beat it in every field where the two compete for prose-lytes. Mr Gladstone continues: “During twelve or fourteen hundred years, it (the Grecian Faith) was the religion of the most thoughtful, the most fruitful (mentally), the most energetic portions of the human family. . . . . For the great part of a century after the fall of Constantinople, in the chief centres of Christian civilization . . . . Greek letters and Greek thought once again asserted their strength over the most cultivated minds of Italy, in a manner which testified to the force and to the magic charm with which they were imperishably endowed. Even within what may be called our own time, the Olympian religion has exercised a fascination altogether extraordinary.”2 We have he shows, followed the Greek in calling those persons given to religious observances, sacrifice, and the practice of morality, good and dikaios, upright or righteous. The right-doing man was a theoudes or God-revering man, and neither lip-service nor sacrifice was acceptable from the evil-doing man, the gods requiring both a pure heart and good deeds. The Greek constantly practised prayer, and, adds Mr Gladstone, “there was a strong general belief in its efficacy.” To the good there was held out a promise of reward, and to the evil punishment, and especially for “the sin against the Holy Ghost,” if by this be understood a “deep deliberate wickedness (atasthalin), a sinning against the light” that is within us, as by setting aside that “holy conscience or inward monitor which tells us we are wrong.” Nay, the Greek here went beyond the Christian, for that was atasthalin, the doing of which, says our author, “but for 1 Juventus Mundi, p. 211.   2 Ibid., p. 382."},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"The Greek versus Jewish and Christian Faiths. Manly Power. 567guilty ignorance, we must know to be wrong.”1 Ignorance, said the Greek, is no excuse for remaining in a wrong course, and therefore it is sin, a stage far ahead of the Jewish code. The gods not only gave over a wicked and ignorant person, but they were even thought to urge him on to his destruction,2 as Yahuê is said to have hardened Pharaoh’s heart till he drowned him in the Red Sea, or as Theos is said to make the erring Christian “believe a lie.” In Homeric days, says Mr Gladstone, “we find among Greeks no infanticide, no cannibalism, no practice or mention of unnatural lusts; incest is profoundly abhorred . . . . . the old age of parents is treated with respect and affection. Slavery itself is mild; and predial slavery apparently rare. There is polygamy; no domestic concubinage, no torture. There are no human sacrifices. . . . . adultery is detested;”3 so that Jews could easily frame a good code for themselves from Greeks, and do not seem to have profited sufficiently whilst in bondage under them.4 Both peoples chose as their rulers men of fine and complete physical capacity, mdeed every race of solo-phalik worshippers did this. Saul was selected for his strength, might and prowess, as were the first chiefs of all tribes or clans, and to them every virgin was sacred and often proffered. It was necessary that the Greek Basileus should have “marked personal vigour and prowess, or surpassing strength of body like the Telamonian Ajax, or vast powers of mind as well as limb, like Odysseus, and personal beauty.”5 He was at once “priest, judge and general, and as king, a great proprietor.”6 Any bodily defect, especially in regard to his virile powers, rendered him as well as Popes7 unfit to reign. Laertes had to quit the throne “before decrepitude, and probably when his activity had but begun to diminish.” Peleus on account of his years, and Telemachos like all our monarchs, was not allowed to succeed till he had arrived at puberty. Every king must be an Aizeos, or a man in the full sense of the word, and in full strength.8 “The voice and the sword,” says Mr. Gladstone, “are twin powers by which the Greek world was governed, and there is no precedency of rank between them;” hence we see why speech and eloquence, or freedom to speak forth in the voice of all men, was held by so many old races to be the sign of God, and Almighty power. Under all circumstances the gift of free speech was “God-like,” and “the voice of the King was the voice of God,” and still “the Speaker” rules in all our assemblies with kingly powers. It was long however, before Greeks arrived at these higher flights of their religion, and not many of them did so, a fact we constantly forget in speaking of ages. when not one in several hundred persons were able to write, nay even to follow a discourse. “Of the resistance of a new worship and its temporary exile,” says Mr Gladstone in regard to Greeks 1 Juventus Mundi, p. 387. 2 Ibid., p. 388. 3 Ibid., p. 395.

Eastern Aborigines. 568breaking away slowly from the old Achaian religion, “we have an instance in the driving of Dionusos into the sea by Lukourgos.”1 Gradually also was the old Pelasgian Zeus represented as one deity, whether in the Thessalian Olumpos, the Ipirian Dodona, or in his later shrines in Atika and Elis, and depicted as the meeting point of the Pelasgik and Hellenik faiths.2 Athena, who in later days was called his daughter, had been an Aithiope, the child of the Libyan Poseidon (an incestuous giant like all sun gods) and of Tritonis, the sister of one Palas and the daughter of another. Like Aphrodité and other great Turan-god-ideas, she sprang from the waters; and every Kuthite race and place claimed her. Though long the rival or opponent of Zeus, she finally became the most beloved of all Arian goddesses, the leading figure in that Grecian faith which eventually, according to Mr Gladstone, recognized “a Deity in some sense three in one . . . . . a Deliverer . . . . . of the seed of the woman, a being at once divine and human. Secondly, the Logos, the Word or Wisdom of God; and next, the woman whose seed this Redeemer was to be.” These traditions, he adds, “appear to be drawn from the same source as those of Holy Scripture;”3 in which case “Holy Scripture” must have drawn its faith-ideas and “traditions” from the old Turano-Arianized religions. This Greek faith, we are informed, also recognized “an evil being and his ministers. . . . . a rebel and a tempter. . . . . and were we able to go further back we should obtain fuller and clearer evidence of the identity of origin in certain respects” of Greek and Hebrew, and therefore of Christian faiths. But surely we do not require anything clearer. For not out of Egypt alone have we thus, aided by this pious “Master in Israel,” called “the young child,” nay his father, mother and grandsires, but out of all the old faiths of the early world. We therefore require no “theories” of either “Inspiration” or “Primitive Revelation,” which the learned author here invites us to consider, but only study, light and intelligence wherewith to trace the universal continuity of history and religions, according to those laws and that order which govern all things, physical and mental, if we have only knowledge and wit enough to see this. Let us now look at the religion developed by the various Orphik writers who lived between the 14th and 8th centuries B.C., and we shall find, and more so as discoveries go on, that Orphik faith is no faint echo of the theologies of the great nations of which we have been speaking. ORPHEANS, 14th-8th Centuries B.C.—The chief Orpheans were Olen, Linus, Orpheus, Museus, Eumolpus, Pamphus, Thamyris and Philamon; and they are termed “Poets and Religionists,” teachers of asceticism, strict morality, abstinence from murder and wrong-doing, and “preachers of religious initiations, sacrifice and prayer.” Plato said that Orpheus taught the soul was divine and only imprisoned in the body as a punishment for former errors. Orpheus, who was a Thrakian and more or less mythical, wrote, says Diodorus Siculus, in the Dorik dialect with Pelasgik letters, and his poems say some, were thrown into Greek by 1 Juventus Mundi, p. 178. 2 Ibid., p. 220. 3 Ibid., p. 207-8."},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"The Greek Logos and Redeemer. Orpheus. Porphyry, Platonists. 569Onomâkritos, the Athenian of Krotonia, who is called the 4th Orpheus, and belongs to about 720 B.C. But the first and great Orpheus, probably flourished about 1200, or, as many contended, even earlier and prior to the Trojan war. He was the first who applied music, “until then unknown to history,” to the worship of the gods, for music he said, “had power over the passions, and produced an ardent longing after the soothing and elevating influences of religion.” He urged the worship of the sun as Bakchos or Dionusos with ascetik purity of life and manners, the strict observance of all solar rites, especially of the vernal Eucharistik “sacrificial feast, on the raw flesh of the ox”—the god’s symbol. This the pious communicants then tasted, partaking of nothing else, and clothed in pure white linen garments.1 Orpheans taught the existence and agency of subordinate intelligences, visible and invisible, angels and demons; the existence of a universal soul, diffused through all the elements of nature and of animal and plant life, manifesting itself variously, sometimes in mere sentient powers, but in other cases developing the higher faculties of reason and active general intelligence. Yet, said they, there is but one intellect and one great Supreme, “The Good,” who comprehends the world in his infinite nature;2 and he manifests himself in the three great Demiurgik Principles, “The Jovial, Dionusiakal and Adonikal,” which became therefore a Trinity, and from these proceeded all super-mundane, mundane, and generative action, necessary to “Perfectness,” of which the sexual was the most important division. These “Religionists” argued that as the heaven corresponds with the earth, imparting to it divers powers and properties, so the earth must be able to receive life, each after its kind. God, said Orpheans, was not all things, nor divided among all; but all things, because present everywhere and to every being totally. He con-tains all, and is yet separate and apart from all; the origin of all multitude, and yet himself a perfect unity. Here then is the source whence the Platonists got their God, and Porphyry—that starter of all Athanasian creeds—his incomprehensible verbiage, like to that strung together by the creed makers of Christendom when attempting to harmonize a Trinity with unity. Thus Porphyry wrote:—“God, Intellect and Soul are each of them everywhere, because nowhere. . . . . Intellect is in the Deity, yet everywhere and in no place of its subordinate essences . . . . the Soul is in the Intellect and in the Deity; everywhere and nowhere in respect to body, but body exists in Soul and in Intellect and in God . . . . Intellect being everywhere and nowhere is the cause of Souls,” &c., &c.; vain attempts of man to explain the incomprehensible or that which is beyond the actual ken of his senses. The followers of Orpheus are described as great “men of prayer,” and many held the most advanced views thereon, believing that prayer only conjoins the good man closer with divinity. Prayer was not to animadvert on the gods, nor draw down their bene- 1 Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Mythologies. 2 Hymns of Orpheus, said to have descended from Puthagoras to the Platonists.

The true Naby, “Prophet” or “Inspired One,” always despises reason. “The Sun was” said by Orpheans to be “the same in the world of Sense as Apolo is in the Intellectual, and as Good is in the intelligible world.” They believed that the Moon or Mene (“called by the immortals Selene,”) contained “mountains, cities and houses.” Though “Mother of Ages” she was “bull horned.” “ Female and male, who with borrowed rays did shine, Now full or hid, now tending to decline.” Orpheus commanded his son, when adoring the Sun, to offer with his prayers, “sweet oblations of frankincense and Mana,” an injunction similar to that given by Moses to Aaron in regard to the Linga or Eduth of Exod. xvi. 33, 34. Indian aborigines and Hindus still place before this “Lord” sweet incense, rice, bread; flowers, &c. Museus was told to pray thus to “Jah, the lofty rider in the heavens,” very much as Jews are taught in some of their Psalms. “ Hear golden Titan, whose eternal eye With broad survey illumines all the sky, Self-born, unweaned in diffusing light, And to all eyes, the mirror of delight” So hymned Mr Taylor, and we shall learn from him, Proclus in Timæus, the Rev. Dr. Cudworth and others, much more concerning Orpheans, and will further delineate their religion in our “Short texts of Faiths.”1 They had as much difficulty as Europe has in separating their “Almighty, all wise and good God,” from “Nature” or “Provi-dence;” for He seemed to act unrestrained, or from an irradicable love of wickedness and destruction, and with complete indifference to the general happiness and comfort of man. However, under all these circumstances, and seeing Nature could neither be reformed nor got rid of, they philosophically worshipped her, and called her “one of the last demiurgik causes of the sensible world.” It was ordered that her altars were always to be fumigated with aromatiks, and she was to he thus addressed as a dual deity— “ Nature, All-parent, ancient and divine, O much-mechanic mother, art is thine; . . . . . Immortal, first-born, ever still the same, Nocturnal, starry, shining, glorious dame; . . . . . Finite and infinite alike you shine, To all things common, and in all things known, Yet incommunicable and alone. Without a father of thy wondrous frame, Thyself the father, whence thy essence came.” 1 We regret that this must stand over for our third volume.

SYRIA AND PALESTINE. If the reader has carefully followed us through all the past researches, he will neither be shocked nor astonished at our finding in Palestine also a confirmation of the law that history and faiths have been continuous, and that, as the motto at the head of our chart states, “there has been no entirely new religion from the beginning of the world;” also that all faiths have mythologies, and that Christianity is only purer in degree than those religions which preceded it; and, that each succeeding faith adapts the previous mythologies to suit the idiosyncrasies and culture of its votaries. Professor Goldziher proves to us in his valuable work on Jewish myths1 that his own race had an ample stock of mythologies, greater and denser indeed than even that volume illustrates. His Jewish brethren had inherited the past, as which of us has not? and the race had not so ancient a past as too-believing Europe has imagined. Archeological researches throughout Syria, whether prosecuted by Chris-tian or skeptik, the members of Biblical societies or by scientific explorers (who for a dozen years back have surveyed the land from Dan to holy Hermon, and from Karmel to the wildernesses of Moab with the sole object of confirming Christian story), alike assure us that what we have written and have yet to say regarding its ancient and Jewish faiths is correct, and that in many places these are by no means yet dead. The old symbolisms still abound in more or less veiled forms, and are still revered in spite of Cross and Crescent, and are intimately woven into the public and social life of the people, and developed with many of the old accompaniments sacred to Solarists, Lunarists and Fire worshippers. Still may all sects be seen praying and fasting at Sol’s and Selene’s stated phases, and by their old shrines in subterranean cavern or on holy mounts, by sacred well or tree, or with bended knee before a revered if not Messianik or anointed stone. Sur-ia is still indeed “the land of the Sun” or Tsur-God—“the Rock,” and “Everlasting Father,” as our Old Testament translators prefer to call him.2 The Tsur still symbolizes him, if not his creative agent, and all caves and wells or domed-shaped rocks or mounts are his sacred arks or omphi, called though they now 1 Mythology among the Hebrews and its Historical Development.

All peaked Hermons, Karmels, upright stones and trees symbolize Baal or Yahuê, and holy fire and water are common to both his forms as generator and genetrix, for without these he acts not. The Judean Kabah or Dome of the Tsur, with the arkite waters of his Miriam, spoke, to the old Idealists of the life to come hidden deep in her fruitful womb; and for similar reasons did Gărăzim become “the Mount of Blessing” to the adoring Samaritan; for there too had the ark rested by the “Cave of Eliun,” which devout Christians, following up the solo-phalik idea, have also dedicated to the feminine principle in one of their female saints. As before “the Cleft” or Ark of Delphi stood the Pillar of Zeus, so before this rocky cleft also stood “the Pillar of the Faith,” the “Stone of the Corner,” but as the later Yahudians said, “the Rock of Offence”—the El-Amud of old, beside which far more ancient races than they, had worshipped their “Righteous Lord” or “Upright God.” These high places of Samaria seem to have been the earliest centre of Yahu-ism, for the old Kushes (Kuthim) yielded not up at first or easily, the Jebus or Mount of Sălm —“the Place of Peace” or Salvation—of their Jove or Tzedek, that is of Malechi-Zedek. Abram was indeed for a time permitted to worship “the High God” of the Jebusi—the pillar or I-u-Sălm—at his hill of Zion, but he finally retired, said Samaritans, to the Sălm of Shechem, on which account his children here built their rude altars, perhaps adjoining the old and holy shrine in the vale between Ebal and Gerezim, for here stands the omphik “tomb of Joseph” with its conventional phali,1 as seen in our Pl. VIIl, p. 386, Vol. I. It is similar to many we know in Eastern lands, and beside such have we oft tarried to watch the fire rites and reverent worship of the dead. Many Samaritans indeed affirm that the Sălm of Malachi-Tzedek was only at their Shechem, and topographically this saddle between two sacred mounts—one lofty and therefore most suitable for their El-Eliun or Alahi of Gen. xxxiii. 20—is exactly such a spot as Sivaites usually select for Lingam altars. By this “Moreh” too was a sacred grove now called El-Mukhna, to which many traditions attach. Failing Mount Moriah or Muré, from which the Mahamadan drove the Christian because it was one of Arabia’s oldest stone shrines, the latter selected the eastern “hill of olives” or Jabel et Tor as a corresponding feminine omphe, and there, over another sacred cave, did they erect “a round church in a round court-yard,” and also place the veiled Linga of those days—the sacred “Foot” print of the Kurios—the Lord Kur or Sun. Here indeed had Solomon erected less veiled emblems of his deities, until the very Yahus, or at least their leaders, called Olivet “the Mount of Corruption” rather than that of “Anointing,” which points to Judeans loving the arkite form of the faith more than the Messianik or Sivaik type. The whole land from stone-loving Petra and its troglodytes, to the Taurus ranges is studded with the living faiths of the far East, but the most diligent Christian 1 On these say Syrians, Muskr and Nukr will sit and judge the soul.

Ancient and Modern. 573archeologists cannot point to a single Christian tradition which actually connects the sacred places with Christian story earlier than our 4th century, unless it be from a remark of Captain Conder’s regarding-the grotto of Beth-lechem, which we know was the cave of Mithras, the God of Lechem or “Bread,” and of his child Tamuz, ages before Yahus existed. Here too is a holy spring, the waters of which give “milk” miracu-lously to the nursing mother, and close by, was a circle of stones sacred to Baal or Belus, and such as our rude forefathers erected when worshipping “the encircler of the heavens”—“the round God,” “the Courser.” It is now acknowledged that Christians only appropriated the revered sites of the old faiths from or about the 4th century. Captain Conder in the accounts of his survey labors in 1878, told the Society for which he has long striven to identify the holy places with Christian story, that “unsupported by other evidence, Christian tradition is not in itself sufficient to fix any site as authentic;”1 and the Biblical Arch. Soc. has, as already shown, acknowledged authoritatively, that they could not establish the fact of a single Hebrew inscription over any part of the land, older than our 3d century. Now this taken in connection with the fact which most minute criticism has con-firmed, that there is no historical evidence of the existence of the gospels “during the first century and a half after the death of Jesus,”2 shows that here at least there was no Christianity worth speaking about, and certainly not such as could materially disturb the worship of the old shrines or much annoy the adherents of the ancient faiths. These certainly rested in peace till 200 A.C., and for 150 years more there was only developed an impure Gnosticism, out of which Pauline Christianity arose; but the faith made no durable mark on all these its supposed cradle lands, and the masses readily yielded up whatever they had imbibed, when their Fatherland called to them once more from the deserts to serve and acknowledge “one God only” and “no Son,” but a messenger from him. Baal-bek or Baal-ath, the great “city of Baal,” with its magnificent solo-phalik shrines, pillars or Lingams, was rendered still grander and more powerful by Antoninus “the Pius” in 150 A.C.; and two generations after that, or in 220 A.C., another equally “pious” but too notorious Roman Emperor, seized its most treasured black stone Linga, and ostentatiously carried it to Rome, and enshrined it on the Palatine; and not till 400 A.C. did another “pious” Emperor, Theodosius, strive to blot out the temples and worship of Baal-bek. Emesa and Laodikeia still adored their “blackstones,” Ephesus her Jovine “image,” and the Seleukians of Antioch their “lapides qui divi dicuntur.”3 The Fălâhin, or lower settled Arabian population of Western Asia, must be dis-tinguished from the Bădăwin, who are still mostly nomads and “by profession” Islāmis, though in their practices and rites, solarites and lunarites, as in the days of Mahamad. They call many of their shrines the “tombs,” tophæ or omphi of Peers or saints, but 1 Tent. Work, Palestine, I. p. 24. Ed. 1878. 2 Supernatural Religion, II. p. 248.

Practically therefore we may class the Bădăwin with their more settled brethren the Fălâhin, and look upon those rude and still simple peoples, as the groundwork or aborigines from whom have sprung the best races of Western Asia, including the Shemites of Mesopotamia. They have been called “unstable as their desert sands,” for though fruitful in promises, they have seen without much concern many faiths come and go, and heedless of the smile or frown of Cross or Crescent, have been ever true only to their rude Nature worship.1 Still do they cling fondly to their little Kiblas, Kubehs, Arks or sacred caves, wells, stones and trees, and cherish that place as blessed indeed by the presence of their God, which has its Beersheba and umbrageous tree. And no wonder, for do they not see Christian and Islami often worshipping with and like them, at their old Beth-Els, Karns and “High places,” and joining with them in casting stones to their God of stones? Nay these vie with them in their unbounded reverence for their old holy spots, where with votive offerings, sacrifices and lighted tapers, they seek the aid and presence of their God, the El, Al or Bâ-al. Still as in the days of Sam-u-El and Saul, do Bădăwin and Fălâhin move in reverent procession round these shrines, and with still greater fervor does the Islāmi here join them at the old solar feast of the Bairām, which these fancy is instituted only to commemorate their legend of the sacrifice of the ram by their “High Father” Abram on Yahuê Irah, as he called the sacred rock of Mount Moriah. The Fălâhin still pray with Christians by the sacred tree of Shiloh, and by Gibeon’s “virgin’s fount of living water,” where as Arabs they light their lamps, and bending low upon “the sacred stone of prayer,” beseech the Năbê, Prophet or holy man to intercede with God or Allah for them. “The fear of the anger of the local divinity,” writes Captain Conder, “is deeply rooted in the hearts of this people, and to forswear oneself by the sacred Kubeh is thought to bring sure disaster and death on the offender. Many persons state that they have received blows from invisible fists, supposed to proceed from the enraged Neby.” He is called “the Mesh or Monument,” but Mahā Esh or M’Esh (Siva) existed before “monuments,” and when none were yet known of. All sects and tribes willingly join in climbing to the high summit of Baal Hazor, there to worship or mutter prayers to their Yahué, Allah, or some other form of Bel or Bâ-al, by his “Enclosure of Sacred Oaks.” The aged know little difference between the old and new gods, nor did many Yahus of old.2 Did not the altars of both and every form of Mălăk, or Milkom, also once stand side by side on holy Olivet, nay in Solomon’s great temple, and for four to five centuries, till cast out for a few years by Josiah; and did not his successors re-establish the old worship including that of Ash-taroth, or as Jer. xliv. 17, 18 shows, of Moloch’s consort, M-l-ch-th, “the Queen of Heaven,” and attribute all the evils which befel the nation in Josiah’s reign, to neglect of this their old faith?

Down to the days of Ezra, the Ale-im and Yahué were merely Hebrew forms of Baal, Ishi or Molech, and the people were called after their gods, as Phoinikes called their sons, Hani-bāl or Asdru-bal.

Thus Jer-u-salem is the place where all seek “the Salvation of Ir,” Ire ́ or Ilu, the old supreme god of Akads, whom Abraham and his ancestors must have long worshipped by the “Gate of Il,” or Bab-Ilu. No wonder he called the first Judean mount which became sacred to him, Yahuê, Irah or Yerah. He was the giver of offspring which Abraham longed for, and to him did Kaldia dedicate “the month of the propitious Bull,” or of Taurus or Iyar, “the principal period for offerings to aid generation or conception.” Indeed this is the meaning, say Asyriologists, of the Akad word Budhinuv, and the Kaldi and Hebrew Bukur or “first-born,” probably from B t n “the womb,” see lsa. xiii. 8. Mr. W. Boscawen says Taurus or Iyar is celebrated for “omens relating to births,” and calls to mind the Zenda Vesta phrase, “Holding the seed of Bulls as a mark of great fertility.”2 Among the various sacrifices of this period, there was one of “Corn one-third of a Mana (or a third of Mana corn?) together with cooked food to the Zalim or Statue,” clearly to the Eduth of Ex. xvi. 34. But this Zalim may be the Salem of Jer-u-salem, and an old name for the “God of Health,” as coming from the roots Sal, Sol or Sul, &c. The Danites called one of their towns Shemesh, which though “the city of the Sun,” is also “Ir the Sun.” Kaleb called his son Iru, and Enoch’s son was Irad,3 and Il, Ir or Oir is not only a city but a citizen, and “the Awakener or Arouser,” that is the Solar God. Neither Fürst nor Gesenius assert that Ir is radically a city, as no one would say Ilium or Ilus was. Caer remained the goddess of Kelts, though Caer was also her “enclosure,” and now means only an enclosure or circle4 as Fürst 1 Pal. Explor. Journ., p. 261. Hosea, ii. 16. 2 Lon.

Like Oir-yah or “Jah the watcher,” so Ir or El was “a Watch- ing Angel,” and “High Places” were suitable for Gods as well as “Watchers.” According to Yahudis, Abraham sacrificed upon the Mount of Muriê, and then dedicated it to Yahuê Ierāh;1 and this name Professor Sayee and Dr. Neubauer find in the words of the Siloam Pool inscription—“the excavation in the Yerah.” They think this Yerah is the old Jebusi division of Ir-u-salm,2 men-tioned in Joshua xviii. 28, for the site had three divisions called Ts-lo, Halp and Ibus; and if this Jbus became the “city of David,” then the Halp or Al-p, is thought to be the southern quarter facing the “temple hill.” Egyptians called Ir-u-shlm, Shaluma, and ancient Arabs, the Dar-al Sâlam or Dares-Sâlem—“the Door of Peace” or of the faith (Sanskrit, Dvara-Salam), and so holy did Mahamad hold “The Lord Salem,” that he very nearly made it the Măka of his faith. Drāvidas like old Kelts called their “High God,” “the Sun,” Ior, Iar or Iau, and a learned Irish priest, Father Smiddy, says that the translation of the word Ayr-raw, “Adoration,” means “speaking to Iar.”3 The Asyrian “God of Eternity\" was called Ir-Kala, and he, like the Egyptian Amen-Ra was “the secret God, who makes to conceive,” the Akadian Iru-ak, and the Kaldi and Hebrew Iru or Eru, both of which have the signification “to conceive and keep secret.” He was in the Kaukasian and Armenian highlands, Ær or Ar, and latterly with Georgians, Ar-din-is, who apparently took the place of “the Khaldis,” “God of the Dead” and of Aarli the place of the Dead, as Professor Sayce has lately pointed out. All these deities are shown to be forms of the Sun-God; and as we now know that Kheti and other Aithiopes (of whom were Turano-Akads) long ruled throughout those highlands before establishing them-selves in Mesopotamia or Syria, we may believe that as Babylonians they were called Khaldis after this tribal form of their Sun-God.4 Professor Sayee here says that this God Ar or Khal was the supreme God of Van, and that the population were called after him, “the men of Khaldis.” Er-al and Ar-El are held to be forms of the Sun-God Tamuz, who fell like Satan to Hades, but to such a Hades or Paradise as Osiris pre-sided over; for Tamuz, like Christ, descended to his lower “land of the Dead,” called Arali, which was, says Professor Sayee, “a land where the waters of life bubble up under the golden throne of the spirits of heaven and earth.” The Armenian Sun-Gods are described generally as Ar-al-ez or Ar-Els, who can restore to life or regenerate the good who call upon them, and they were known as such from the 7th C. B.C. down to our 4th century. Professor Sayee thinks that no Arians ruled in Armenia, prior to the 7th C. B.C. The reader will here observe that the oldest Indo Kuthite Bâli worshippers of North India, Drâvidia, Kaldia, Asia Minor and Teutonik Europe, all acknowledged this Bâal God, Ar, Ilu, Eru, Herr, Er-mun or some form of Hermes. But to return to Syria and its Fălăhin. Throughout Syria the little Harams or sacred enclosures are called Mukāms 1 Gen. xxii. 2. 14. Yahudis = Jews in Asia. 2 Pal. Ex.

Syrian Mukams. 577(literally, in those days, resing places or encampments), in which is a Mazar or shrine having a Kubeh or domed cell, containing if not an actual emblem (for Islām has stamped out image worship), yet a fanciful gof-idea; and near to the Kubeh is usually a sacred “grove,” or rather l’arbre sacré, and perhaps a stelê or Matzebê. “There is no Mukām,” says Captain Conder (and he has noted some 300 belonging to the Fălăhin), “without its sacred tree, every bough, nay leaf of which as it falls, is treasured up within the sacred building;” and the same veneration attaches to every stone which perchance falls from the Mazar. “In almost every village of Syria,” he says, “there is a Kubbeh,” but if any be too poor for such a domed structure, then a special plot of ground is marked off for the God and kept tidy, and receives some special stones or treasured emblems,” thus reminding us of many similar holy Indian sites1 where a deity or his Shekina is supposed to preside. The Syrian Kubeh is of masonry, with a chamber usually 10 feet square, and kept well white-washed. It has a Mihrab or “prayer niche” on the south wall, no doubt formerly meant for “the standing figure” or God-idea, indeed a Mukām signifies “the standing place,” and even now, “the sacred place where some saint is supposed to have stood.”2 The root may lie in such old Eastern terms as Muk (Mocham), Much or Mut, usually applied to a temple figure, face or Lingam. As in India, “the walls round the door and the lintel stones” of the Syrian Kiblas, or Mut-houses, are “generally adorned with daubs of orange-colored henna,” which in India at once consecrates the Dvâra or gate, to Siva, the Dvârka-Nât; and like the Indian, the Syrian “removes his shoes before passing this threshold, and takes care not to tread on it.” He even craves the deity’s permission to pass, for bowing reverently he exclaims, “Your leave, o blessed one.” We have already pointed out the very sacred character of the door and portico-idea, and much more will hereafter appear; for the great skeleton gates at the entrance of Hindu, Chinese and Japanese shrines, and lofty archways before Mahamadan mosks and tombs, are all founded on the same religious idea, viz., that they are the symbols of the “Door of Life,” by which all save the ungodly must strive to enter in, as our New Testament urges. The Madras parent if he has lost a child, will, when he gem another, dig a hole under the sacred door-sill of his house where it was born, and taking the infant to the outside, pass it through this into the house, lisping the name then given to it, at the same time.3 It is important to remember, as pointed out in the Pal. Ex. Jour., that Abraham and his family were Fălăhin, and of course therefore had a still ruder faith and rites than the Fălăhin of to-day, for human sacrifice and coarse phalik or Lingam worship has now died out.4 Still however, the Palestine surveyors’ reports show that the Fălăhin worship on karns, like those on the heights of Malhah near to Jerusalem, and in the 1 Cf. our Figs. 21, 59 and 75 of Vol. I., and pp. 71, 156 and 193. 2 Palestine, II. pp. 218-220. 3 Indian Anty., February 1881, p. 55. 4 Pal., p. 270.

It is probable that such a G-l was no “Heap” or Hermes, but a “Druid Circle” with a pillar or M-tz-b-é in the centre. Indeed Laban called the whole a M-tz-p-e, see Gen. xxxi. 45-54; and there is no difference here betwixt the b and p, nor practically between a god, his pillar and ark or circle symbolism. Our Old Testament translation is confusing. A Matzebê or Lingam equally repre-sented Baal, Jehovah and Moloch, as it did Osiris, Jupiter and Siva. Cromlechs, dolmens and lingas are common in all lands sacred to Jewish and Christian story. At Mareighat, fitly named “the place of anointing,” there is a large and fairly formed Lingam, and a perfect grove of smaller ones surrounding a temple; whilst on the adjoining hills are numerous kromlechs and a sacred fountain called Menyeh, a word which has its base in Mnā, “desire and sperma genetales.” This betokens sundry other phalik matters as already dwelt upon under Menê, “a man,” “the obelisk,” &c. Ali the servant of Allah (from Āl and Ālat, the Phalus), is fabled to have produced this fountain by striking the ground with his spear, just as Siva does with his Tri-sul or “Quickener.” The whole range of hills from which comes this “fount of desire,” was no doubt sacred to Baal Pe-or, “the opener,” and to Alāt, Mena or Mini, the Aramaik Venus as the Talmudists call her.1 The high round hill of Tabor, known to Christians as the “Mount of Trans-figuration,” is called by the Fălăhin the umbilicus of their great earth mother Terra—that womb of nature in which we are all transfigured. To her also they had sacred temples at Askalon and Akcho with suitable holy waters; and still at Tripolis, her very ancient city, do we find her pond of holy fish, which are said to “fight against infidels,” and to which multitudes still make long pilgrimages, and worship with offer-ings and sacrifices. We have often come across. similar holy ponds and lakes in India, and been warned off with our unholy rod and line. The Venus of Tripolis was Kadishah or Atergatis; indeed the city is called Kadîshah, a name elsewhere explained as expressive of coarse phalik vices. Blue is here a sacred color as with all Vishnuites or Ion-im, and occasionally there may be seen hanging to the houses egg charms with a blue prepucial bracelet round them, which they say averts “the Evil eye”—a property of all yoni emblems. A Zion or Moriah, El Mahrakah (“place of sacrifice”) or Karmel (Maha-Kar-El?), like a Palatine and Capitoline, required no emblems to denote their deity, but Gaza of the plains did, and here was found a great Jovine figure, 17 feet in height, which was worshipped down to 500 A.C. Kar m’ El is the very god himself, and has no temple but only an altar, where beside a sacred tree and well, Pagans and Christians throng to the Karn God at Sol’s appointed phases, with burnt sacrifices and incense. “It is not too much to say,” writes the head of the exploring parties, “that every isolated, round or conical, mountain top in Palestine was once a seat of Sun-worship. Thus at SHEIK ISKANDU, west of the Plain of Esdraelon, on a conical volcanio peak, we find the shrine of a prophet who is described 1 All this is confirmed in Pal. Explor.

NEBY DUHY is a similar conical peak north-east of the last, and has a domed shrine on the top. The legend attached states that the bones of the saint were carried there by his dog, which reminds us of the Parsi veneration of dogs (the companions of Mithras), who, to the horror of Greek writers, were permitted to devour the bodies of the most noble among the Persian fire-worshippers. The translation of bones is a common Moslem tradition. Thus on Ebal we have the sacred shrine of ‘The Pillar of the Fait,’ and near it the sacred cave of Sitti Islam-îyeh, who gives her name to the mountain, and whose bones were carried through the air to this spot from Damascus. . . . . North of Jerusalem by the village of Sh’afat is the generally recognized site of NOB, where the tabernacle once stood; and this Nob, is Neby or Nebo the Asyrian Mercury. This deity was symbolized by a stone or a stone-heap, and he was one of the gods of the pre-Islamite Arabs who worshipped stones (batuli or stone heaps as representing Allah) and sacred trees, and the Asherah or grove of the Canaanites. . . . . The worship of Mercury included the throwing of stones on a heap as mentioned in the Talmud (Sanhed. vi. 7), and aho by classic authors; and it is of interest to point out, that there is a most remarkable natural monument such as was understood by the name ZIKR or ED—a high conical rock-peak immediately east of the road to Jerusalem at Sh’afat.”1 Of course the Zikr is the Zkr, “sword” or “male” (thing) of Gen. i. 27, which Arabs usually make Dzkr, and identify as above with an Ed, Od, do, or Yad, dy, “Hand,” “column or cone of witness,” or “a great altar to see to.”2 It is in fact a generic name for any Nebo, Nob or obeliskal object, and is so treated by us at p. 175, Vol. I. Thus Josephus speaks of the Ed of the Reuben compact, as east of Jordan, and the surveyors see an Ed, in “the conical form of the summit of the Kurn Sartabeh or Jewish beacon station, where they lighted the fire on the appearance of the new moon.” On this cone, which is 270 feet high, is a building surrounded by an oval circle of stones rudely heaped up, and on the eastern terrace are caves. “The general effect,” says Captain Conder, “ is that an ancient sun temple has been converted later into a small fortress.” He adds that the shrines on every mountain and under every green tree, have been described in his Tent. Work; and that “the prophets called Belân, Baliân and B’alîn seem the modern representatives of the ancient Baalim, and (that) a male and female saint are constantly worshipped, as were Baal and Ashtoreth, in shrines near to one another, many of which have sacred caves beneath.” Theirs were the sacred shrines on the snowy cone of Hermon, that “great centre of Sun worship,” all oriented says Colonel Warren, and probably built so late as our 2nd century. The construction and Sivaite entourage, here remind us of one or two high mountain shrines which we ourselves surveyed in Dravidian India—also a land of old Kushites. “On the top of Hermon,” writes Captain Conder, “is a plateau, and from this rises a sort of peak (the Linga) or natural altar, round which a circle of masonry has been built, while a small pit is sunk in the top of the rock,” which the Hindu would call the Argha or hollow Yoni. “There is no temple on the summit” to hide or dwarf the divine emblems of the Creator and Creatrix, but one, as necessary to protect the worshippers in severe weather, is outside the circle on the south, whilst “on the north is a sacred cave.” There are other caves a little lower down “used by the Druids for the retreat of their initiated,” and such caves are the true prototypes of 1 Art.

The Christian Druses preserve, says Captain Conder, “the rites of the Gnostics, to whom Sun worship was familiar,” and as Gnostics were the first Christians, in fact the only sect we know anything authentic of during the first 150 years or so A.C., we see what Christianity grew from, for Gnostiks being nearest the fountain head, should have known best the doctrines and practices of the founders of the faith. The summit cave of Hermon was “the Cavern. of the Dawn,” as the old Turano-Akads called the emblem of their Sun God of the Winter Solstice. It was “the Mithraik Cave” of later Aryans and Shemites, and “an essential feature in the rejoicings of the Dies Natalis Invicti Solis,” and of all those rites concerning Tamuz his Son, “the Redeemer of his people,” for whom Jews wept in autumn, and on account of whose birth they rejoiced at Eotri, our Easter. BETHEL, the centre of the old Calf or Solar Bull worship of the northern Jewish tribes, has still a Druid circle, but that at Shiloh has been destroyed. On the plain of Abu’ Amr there is an altar of undressed stones beside a sacred tree, tomb and cave, and still do Jews visit a tomb and cave in Galilee, on the side of Jebel Jennuk, the loftiest mountain in the district, “for the sacrifice of articles by fire.”1 Another crom-leach in this district is called “the stone of blood” probably because blood re-quired to be here offered. We have elsewhere pointed out that Indian hill tribes still offer up cocks and goats, &c., on such stones or “Earth fast Rocks;” see the closing part of our Chap. II. and elsewhere. At TYRE or Tsur, writes Captain Conder, “Ambrosial stones” exist under the sea, and “on an isolated hillock stands the fane of Neby M’ashuk, ‘the beloved of women,’ no doubt the ancient Adonis or Melkarth, and the tradition of this local Sun God is (still) preserved in the annual festival of St. Mekhlar.” There was a celebrated shrine of Venus and Adonis—the Syrian Asher,2 at the waterfalls of Apheka, and many practices belonging to this worship survive among the Nuseiriyeh and Ism’aileh of northern Lebanon, who still worship the Sun, Moon and Elements. Even human sacrifice says Conder, appears to be one of their customs, a relic of those of Baal, Moloch or Saturn. Gibbon also mentions charges of this kind brought by Pagans against the early Christians, whilst St. Epiphanius gives a detailed. account of this “Perfect Passover” of the early Gnostics, which included the sacrifice of a child, an essential rite of Abrahamites; see Sir William Muir’s Art. R. As. Jour. for January 1882. Of prominent sacred monoliths there is the “Pillar of Jacob” and Sakhrat of Job3 east of Jordan, one north of Acre, and several at Baalbek and north-westerly. Some are dedicated to hermits who, says Conder, “imitating Simeon Stylites, used to seat themselves thereon”—a practice much older than Christianity, and directly con-nected with the worship of the Sun’s creative power. Many of these hermits lived in our 5th century, more especially near Aleppo, where are the ruins of the great Cathedral of St Simeon; thus closely is Christianity connected with both human sacrifice and Sun worship. 1 Cf.

Christian Paganism. 581We know that Constantinople had long before and after the quasi conversion of Constantine, a huge Sun-stone or pillar of porphyry, on which was a figure of Apolo, the features of which the Emperor altered, so as to represent himself, and as a Sun-worshipper; for he never separated Christianity from Solarism. He placed a great thorny halo rounel the head, which Christians said represented the nails used at the crucifixion!1 The same sort of thing occurred at Rome, where the lance or old Quiris of the Sabines was again brought forward as worthy of worship, because, said the adherents of the new faith, by it had flowed forth the blood and water of the Lord of Life; so they quarrelled about the possession of it, as their predecessors had done for the sceptre of Pelops, the spear of Achilles, the sword of Memnon, the hide of the Kaledonian boar, and the Palladium of Troy. It is not easy to move out of the old ways or for-sake the ancient forms and symbols, and truly did Faustus say to Augustine: “You have but substituted your Agapæ for the sacrifices of the Pagans, for their idols, your martyrs, whom you serve with the same honors. You appease the shades of the dead with wines and feasts; you celebrate the solemnities of the Gentiles, their Kalends and their Solstices; and as to their manners, those you have retained without any alteration, and nothing distinguishes you from the Pagans, except that you hold your assemblies apart from them.” Now Faustus was an African Christian bishop who flourished in 400, and knew the truth when he thus wrote describing Christianity. Two hundred years after this, Persia seriously complained of the falling away of the West from Sun worship, for we read that when Heraklius begged for peace from Chosroes, Emperor of Persia, that monarch replied: “I will never give peace to the Emperor of Rome, till he has abjured his crucified God and embraced the worship of the Sun.” So that the so-called heathen world only recognized the real departure of the West from its old Lord and faith, about the close of the 6th century A.C. Thus no objection would be taken to the present vernal rites at “the Holy Sepulchre,” by ancient Aithiopes, Jebusites, Phoinikes, Egyptians, Pelasgi, &c. Nay, we believe they would join in nearly all; and willingly cry with the Christians: “This is the tomb of the Kurios; His blood has saved us; for Kur’s blood is wine indeed, and his flesh, bread;” which the anxious cultivators of these precarious highlands then saw they were to receive, in vineyards and cornfields.2 Over “The Dome of the Rock” or Kubet es Sakra—“the house of the God of Jacob” and of Christians, Constantine is said to have erected a gorgeous shrine; yet says Mr Fergusson, “there would be no difficulty in assigning the building to an earlier age than even that of Constantine.”3 We feel sure that the lofty and massive walls which have been now exposed, were constructed by the great Turano-Shemitik building races, and had originally no connection whatever with Jews or their faith. Everything yet discovered, points only to Kuthim, Phoiniki or Beni Anaks. 1 Professor Draper’s Religion and Science, pp. 46-50. 2 Cf. Conder’s Palestine, II. p. 105-6. 3 His. Archet. II. 435.

The titles are precisely such as the pious Sivaite applies to-day to his Mahâ-Deva, also a great Tsur God. The whole site was covered with places sacred to this Kurios, and especially those caves called “the Holy Sepulchre,” where were many sacred stones, as well as the everlasting fire of the mountain goddess. At this spot “the Lord” was held to have sunk, but only to soon rise again, as indeed he does every vernal equinox. Then high and low, rich and poor, rush to receive his renewed spirit or “celestial ray” as it issues through the door or cleft of the Rock, by the side of the altar—aptly named “that of unction” and St Ion2—at whose fetes, Beltine fires still oft light up the mounds of Kelts and Teutons. “Without this renewed fertilizing fire from heaven, no tribal or family fire can bless our homes with increase,” has said every ancient race, and so still do Hindus as well as these Christians. “The Dome of the Tsur,” that is the Omphe of the Tsur God—called by Eusebius “a Salutary Monument,” because Shalum signifies this from Egypt to Kaldia—had suitably near to it, its Mahâ-Deva and his “High Priest” the Maleche-Zedek, the “Lord of the Tabernacle,” and of the Sakuth or Sakti “of your king,” as Amos wrote.3 He was the Tsădăk or “High God” who had here blessed his epony-mous son Abram, “the High Father,” and to him had Ab-salum or “Father Shalam” of a later generation, here erected a Yad or “Hand”-pillar—his emblem—which still stands characteristically, at the entrance of “the Golden” or eastern gate adjoin- ing the mons and fount of the “Virgin Mother of God;” and to it as a. veritable Hermes do Jews still throw stones.4 The Sălem of Zion was, as Psalm lxxvi. 2 assures us, the special tabernacle of M-Zădăk; and it was to recover these 1 Cf. the Heb. of Is. xxx. 29, xl. 8, xxvi. 4, and numerous other texts, as to God being a Rock. 2 Cf.

In 1112 the Christians re- christened the upper shrine, as their Templum Domini, forgetful alike of the old faith and of the sex of the deities of ovicular mounts, caves and wells. But worse still, with sacrilegious hands they pared down the Rock God’s Omphe into its present shape, and covering it with marble, erected an altar thereon.1 Had they been better acquainted with the faith, they would have known that Yahveh, “the Elohim” and his Ruach best loved the natural Sakra, which no tool had touched; and so when Saladin in 1187 again “won the city, he tore down the altar and once more exposed the bare rock”—with the true instinct of a son of “Arabi the blest,” that old land of inveterate stone worshippers. He covered the Christian frescoes, regilded the dome and beautified the whole shrine, and never since has Kâfer or Christian been permitted, save with bared feet, to pollute the old home of this Pârvati or “Moun- tain Goddess.” Adjoining the sacred Masjid El Haram was the commonly used “place of prayer,” the shrine called the Jamia El Aksa or “Far~off place of meeting,” alluding it is said, to its great distance from Măka, and the long journey which the prophet made to see it. To the Moslem it is also very sacred, as the spot where the revered Kalif Omar threw himself down in fervent prayer for the success of Islam in 637. The sex had here not been reversed, for on this or an adjoining site had Justinian a century before erected a temple to the virgin mother of heaven.3 Of course it had a prior sanctity, for the worshippers of Mithras could here conveniently kneel in prayer, gazing on the sacred Calvarian mount over the cave; and Christians too recognized its fitness, as we see by the crusaders remodelling the building and dedicating it to Solomon!—fit demi-god of such a solo-phalik shrine. Subject to some explanations already given and to follow, our inspection of and investigations regarding the sacred shrines in and about Jerusalem, and of many similar sacred hills in the East, where the votaries of the Right and Left Hand sects—Sivais and Vishnuvas or Ion-im have similarly determined upon a joint worship—has long convinced us that the “Holy Sepulchre” was the Lingam and Solar Fire shrine of the “Secret God,” “The Most High” and “Lord of all Holy Fires;” and that the great Omphik or Wombal Mount of Murê or Moriah, was the Vishnuite one of Terra or Pârvati—mother of all rounded mounts, more especially those with caves and wells. We see this was the case with the Eruthrean Paphos—a form of Pâpas, the Zeus Papaios or great “Father God” of ancient Asiatiks, and of his Paphia the Cyprian Kun or Queen, who presided on that rounded hill, so very similar to Moriah, as will be seen from the landscape given by General Cesllola on p. 214 of his Cyprus. The topography is perfect. She there sits on an ovicular mound, overlooking a plain 1 Conder’s Palestine, I. p. 321.  2 Ibid., p. 325."},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

The great Lingams (some 18 feet high) partake also of her attributes, being true Dole or Hole-maens or Holed-stones, on which her votaries “make their vows,” that is pray to her. It appears that the vast multitudes forming the Páphian deity’s procession, when arriving from his seat, the old “Eruthrre or Neo-Paphos” (some miles east), used to halt before these his Matzebas or Ashrs, and after suitable worship and offerings to them, then solemnly ascend his Mons Pārvati. Our readers must remember that only male shrines give forth creative and re-generative vernal fires; and that only from the God’s “Tomb” by the Mount of Shălm, and not from the “Dome of the Rock,” does holy fire emanate. In the latter is only the quiescent small Argha (Yoni lamp) of the Arkite Queen, and there it burns quietly though everlastingly, in the narrow passage leading to the sacred watery abyss of the Omphe of Shalm, as already explained. Also we must remember that ignorant Christians would naturally be misled by the word Tomba, into thinking that the ancients meant a sepulchre, and hence connect the old Sivaite Tuphos with their Lord’s burial. But such was not the original meaning of a Tomba, Tuph, Toph or Taphos. These were altars, and only latterly with Greeks and Latins did they become tumuli or places to tumulo or bury. The Tophoi or Tuphæ of Aithiopes and Phoi-nakes were “High places,” conical mounds of earth, and even towers, as the Egyptian Taphanis or Taph-Osiri, &c. In fact, as Bryant argues, a high altar to the Sun was called a Tuph-On, and Virgil so called an altar or hillock before a temple.1 The Tophet of Saturnists was a “High place” like unto those of Baal,2 where were offered burnt and even human sacrifices, to this God of all fertile fires. Any head or altar-like figure, as the high Persian head dress, was a Tuph or Touphas, and hence “the sepulchre rock over the rotunda,” would reasonably be called a tomba, and situated as it is, so nearly on the same east and west meridian line as the Arkite or female shrines of the Sakra and Olivet, it would naturally be chosen as an abode of the Apolo, “Lord” Adonis or Asher.3 Judeans were essentially Arkites or Vishnuites, and their Mosaik horror of Sivaite bull or calf worship became stronger as this was developed by their congeners the Samaritan Yahus. In many points however, only a thin veil divides the sect. Thus neither a Lingam nor Bull appears in an Arkite shrine, but the God’s creating Fire and the euphemistik Prā-băt or Divine “Foot” are usually there. Hence appear the sacred Footprints on Olivet, “the Dome of the Rock,” in the Mask at Bâlbek, and one near Nebo, which is flanked with Hermai. There are two holy pillars on the Haram, though these are not used as Lingams, but as Yoni emblems, between which the pious pull each other through, and are thus “born again.” Captain Conder eloquently but disapprovingly describes the rushing of the 1 Bryant’s Myth., I. p. 449.

The floor is (here) unoccupied save by the short column marking the centre of the world,” that is the Centre of Life, and here we are in the presence of the emblem of the Life-giving God. There is no mistaking Agni, God of Fire, for no such long or “short column” will ever be found except in connection with him, or as he is worshipped by his Paphia. It is usual to sink his image deep down in a cave, cleft or fount, as we explain and illustrate in pages 38-40, Vol. I.; and so we find him in the sunken fount of Abu,3 the rotundas of Benares and throughout India, just as he was in the Libyan Amonium and Delphik cleft, and apparently so in the deepest recess of Irish Tuphas or towers. History relates that when Omar Kālif recovered “the Dome of the Rock” from Christians, his first care was to purify and suitably enshrine it, and still its enshrinement makes astonisbed archeologists exclaim, “In honour of what were all these beautiful surroundings? It must be for yonder low and rude looking rock of dusky limestone rising some 6 to 8 feet over the elsewhere tesselated floor. See, it is carefully railed round and narrowly watched over, and canopied and draped with costly silks. They call it the Ebn Shatiê, ‘the priceless treasure, around which the whole world is gathered together—the Sakhra or Foundation of all things, and symbolizing the creation of all life,’ a primeval emblem, and the Testimony or Eduth of this great ark.” See our sketch of the Ebn and its ark on page 184. Yes indeed, this is the theme of Moslem and Jewish writings! the veritable God of the place, “pared down” though the rock be by ignorant and quasi improving modems. Captain Conder calls it “The Rock of Paradise; the scene of Mohammed’s Ascension; the Source of the Rivers of Paradise; the place of the prayer of all Prophets; THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE WORLD.” It is indeed “the Paradisiacal stone,” though Hindus, like the old Eruthrw, would more correctly term it the Aphro-diziacal or Ambrosia Petra, and a natural or “Earth-fast” form of the same idea which they also enshrined on their Paphian hill. On that, too, was a pure Arkite cult, and as we have just shown, it too overlooked the Tomba, Altar or Shrine of 1 Tent. Life, I. pp. 326-345. 2 Vol. I. pp. 401-427, and cf.

He came across six of these holed lithoi, and saw young Cyprian women visiting them very much as in ancient days, with lighted tapers and candles, and depositing jewellery and other articles in the sacred holes of the monoliths, and praying for sundry matrimonial objects. The older women, he says. went to these symbols of Paphos for health and salvation—the usual Shalm-idea, also with candles and offer-ings. and prayed to the “Health Giver” for cure of the infirmities of age. In our Plate x., fig. 8 p. 168. will be seen such symbols as once held the first place in Jewish and other arks, and we gave in our vol. I. p. 218. fig. 93, iii. the stone which, as the Rev. T. Wilson states,1 occupied the Sanctum or Holy of Holies after the ark disappeared. The latter was evidently not even then of such material import-ance to the ruling body as this Abn Sh-t-i-ê, hytc }ba, called metaphorically “The Shat or Stone of Foundation,” and “Seat or emblem of Stability”—figures of speech common to Christ, Jews and Christians, especially in early times before “the paring down” of the Divine symbol took place. This Rock was never under-valued by Christians. The crusaders of the 12th century used to crowd around it and pray fervently to their Trinity of Gods and the Virgin Mother of Heaven—a suitable Miriam for one of the oldest of Moriahs. Both ancient and modern Jewish writers contend that a “Stone of Foundation” (a name by which they concealed the old and gross idea), “stood within the sanctum, being three fingers (9 inches ?) abovc the ground or its pedestal,”2 which points to an ovicular stone like that of the Astarte of Elia, or some form of the Eduth of Exod. xvi. 34, which existed before Sinai was reached, or “Law or Testimony” heard of. The Eduth of Emisa, fig. 8 of our Plate x. p. 168, would as well suit the description as the Astarte of Plate xvi. p. 448. Such small emblems best suited the arks of wandering tribes, as they could be taken out when they halted, and set up for general worship on their rude unhewn altars. The Tsur or Rock-God is but the permanent and enlarged idea of more settled Lingaites. The original meaning of the word Shatê is like that of the “Eduth,” tdoh, some-what obscure. Shateh in the verbal form is “to drink, indulge, debauch,” and as a noun is “bud, root, or seat of production.” A sh-at is a “Pillar, column, stability, the parts of shame, a root, stamen, seat of power, essence, foundation,”3 all of which meanings are embraced in the Sanskrit words Linga and Yoni; and every ark had one of these. See that of Isis with its Osirian symbol, given on p. 201 of our vol. I. (and more decently than in the original), as it used to be carried by nudes at Sol’s festivals. It is a “boat of Life,” and Kubele’s worshippers carried a similar ark-boat, 1 Archeol. Dic., Art.

George Faber.1 This author grieves over the depravity of the early Christians in calling Adam, a Priapos or “the mast of the boat” or Argha, and symbolizing him in upright pillars; but this is in accordance with both the present and ancient meaning which attaches to the word Adām in the east. viz., “the Argha-Nâtha of the life boat or womb of nature.” We give here such an ark with the Eduth or Adāma as was common in Egypt. It is from Rosselini, and will be found in Smith’s Bible Dic., i. 106 with much good matter if we can read betwixt the lines, and allow for orthodox bias and probable ignorance of the old faiths. Such an Egyptian ark or Arun, with its flying seraphim overshadowing “the Testimony” [Eduth or Linga], would naturally be the model which the rude nomads would aim at conforming to, when making an ark for their Ale-im or Yahuê; and note, that as in eastern shl-ines, the whole is like its “Om” or “Gem” for which it was constructed, that is, like to “the Jewel of the Lotus” or “Arkite Principle.” We have elsewhere dwelt upon the so little understood ejaculatory prayer of the solo-arkite Budhists of Tibet, the ôm mane padmi hun, words so foreign to the life and thoughts of the good hermit of Gayâ, but so clear when read in the light of the old faiths. Let us now turn to the earliest detailed account we can find of this and the adjacent Sivaik shrines; and we cannot perhaps do better than here follow the two pious and orthodox English travellers of the 17th century, as given by Calmet in his Fragments of 1799. These fully corroborate all our statements in regard to not only the so-called “Sepulchre,” but all the neighbouring shrines, giving us topographical facts now very difficult, if not impossible, in most cases to elicit and substantiate. We should perhaps mention to the European reader that the idea of a sacred Sivaite or other solar cave or temple, having contained a dead body, however revered, would be abhorrent to every solo-phalik worshipper, and Yahus inherited this old prejudice. It would be sacrilegious blasphemy in their eyes to allow a dead body, however revered, to go near to a shrine of “The Living God,” whether this was in a holy Tomba or on his Sun or Zion mounts or the Omphe of his Miriams. Messrs. Maundrell and Sandys visited all “the Holy Places” in Easter of 1697, and their very detailed authentic accounts, as recorded in their own words in Calmet,2 assure us that the whole city, but especially the sites of Moriah, Zion and suburbs, were hotbeds of fire and phalik worship as usually developed still in the east. The Fragments of Calmet, small print and double columns, from page 62 to 85 bristle with solo-phalik details, so much so, that we scarcely know how to condense these, and 1 Cabiri, II. p. 348. 2 Cal.

We would first ask our reader then to put away from his mind all Biblical stories of both the Old and New Testaments, and simply look fully at the facts—the topography, symbolik objects and such rites and shrines as have grown up around them. Let him dismiss the later ideas of “tombs,” “sepulchres,” “crosses,” &c., and try to view all as dispassionately as if he had never heard of “the Holy Land,” but of the early land of Aithiopes, Kuthim, Kheti, Palashts and Phoinikes, and of their Grove and Ashêra worship. Nor is this request so un-reasonable as to some it may at first appear, for we have no contemporary and really independent and historical evidence of Jews and their religion until about ‘the cap-tivity,’ and really none of Christ sufficient to identify the details of his life as depicted by the unknown gospel writers of our second century,1 with the very ancient shrines, symbolism and topography of this Shălm of “The Most High God.” The first object which confronted our pious travellers as they entered what they considered to be “the sepulchre of the Messiah or Anointed One,” was precisely what we know so well in the East, and usually en-counter at the entrance of holy caves or temples of Siva, viz., “an Anointed Stone,” but here prostrate and called the “Stone of Unction.” Christian legend explains that here the Lord’s body was anointed, but we prefer accepting the world-wide fact of all such phâli (male or female) being anointed or Messianik ones; see Arnobius and Bagster’s note on the smooth stones of Isaiah lvii. 6.2 It had been the Dvârka Nât which once stood upright at “the Door of Life,” and not less revered did it become, when in-jured and fallen. It was carefully “enuironed with a rail of brass about a foot high,” and it faced the chapel of St John—the old I-On; and just as in the Lingam shrines of India, “ouer it there hang seven lamps which burne continually . . . . and (the people) kisse and kneele to (this stone) rubbing there upon their crucifixes, heades and handkerchers, yea whole webs of linnen which they came into farre countries and preserve the same.” We have seen the Aryans and non-Aryans of India acting similarly, and heard much also regarding their rubbing certain parts of their per- sons on such unguentous stones, believing that the God of Fertility would thus impart his Salem or salutary power.3 The seven lamps-emblems of Sol’s seven days, have now given place to huge and suggestive wax candles, “reaching half way to the roof.”4 Threading other various chapels of the supposed sepulchre, where appear to have peen numerous sacred stones, some with “Footprints” (these veiled phalasims of Vishnuites), others stamped with crosses, the travellers came to the entrance of the innermost dark cell, called “the tomb of the Messiah,” a correct and significant name, 1 Even Dr. S.

Here he is “the Cippus without an image”—the Phalange of Bâal or Bâli worshippers, and in position and form very like to the Mahā-Deva standing near the innermost cell of the Caves of Elephanta. Mr Sandys confirms our idea as to this stone having been a Keftor lingam, for he adds, that there “here adioyneth, a chappell vsed in common by the Ægyptians and Æthiopians.” The travellers crept into “the holy place,”—a low dark cavern where was “an altar and picture demonstrating the Resurrection” of the God, and here was fire per-petually burning in the form of “numerous lamps suspended over and in front of an altar.” This portion was, they were told, “railed off by the pious Helena (a character later history does not accord her), because of the inconveniency which proceeded frorn the tapers, haire and other offers throwne in by votaries, which defiled the monument.” The reader has probably already noticed that the offering of hair is an important mystik rite connected with puberty and “the Hairy God”—the Sun and his Men-hêrs. We shall have much to say thereon hereafter, for “the first-fruits” of puberty were thus pourtrayed at the Venus fetes of this coast.3 Our travellers relate that “at this altar only the Latins say maase, but to the railing come thousands of Christians to perform their vowes, and to offer their tears yearly, with all the expressions of sorrow, humilitie, affection, and penitence;” adding that “it is a frozen zeale, that will not be warmed with the sight thereof”—a sentiment we very much reciprocate, and would add a word regarding. We have often stood by similar altars, and heard very different language used by good but not wise though perfervid Christians.

He added that “those who allow the existence of a First Cause, but deny His intervention in the affairs of man, who admit no revelation of a future state or any system of rewards and punishments, may be counted by myriads.” These “myriads” of course form a large portion of the 56 per cent., and many are the most cultured of men and women—those who have studied all religions, and weighed well the arguments as to spirit and matter existing apart, an immortality without a body or memory of the past, the so-called rectification of present injustice and misery by a future measure of blessedness, &c., &c., and being unable to find any proof of a revelation of a god to a man, these cultured “Unbelievers” have agreed with Budha and Confucius, that they must confine their attention to what is within their comprehension, and for the present endeavour simply to be good and do good because such is good, and leads to the truest happiness of themselves and others.

But there is a further source of error in these statistics due to insincerity which no care, and we have here exercised much, can get rid of. It would largely reduce both the 648 millions and the 826, but especially the former. The truth will only be learned in that millenial period when the lion will lie down with the lamb, or the bishop tolerate “the avowed infidel,” or when men and women cease to trouble them-selves as to the speculative theories of their fellows in regard to kingdoms and powers beyond this universe and the ken of our senses. But to resume. According to Messrs. Maundrell and Sandys, Calvary or Golgotha was a “rounded eminence” crowded with chapels, and was, as one of the two most holy places, early brought within the circuit of the city walls to the rejection of the greater part of Mount Zion, which used to be included 1 At the Glasgow Free Church Presbytery meeting of 30th March 1882, it was declared that out of a population of 700,000 in the city and its suburbs, a census showed that only 135,922 attended church; that is 16½ per cent. in that huge centre of religious Scotland, and this we think is much in excess of the truth. One pious speaker of the Presbytery said that “a great proportion of the working- classes in particular had no practical connection with the Church—not only the intemperate and depraved, but the sober, industrious and respectable people; though fulfilling in a sort of commend- able way very many duties connected with their positions in life, they were yet unconnected with the Church of Christ.” He added that there is a “widely pervading scepticism especially amoug the sensible, hard-headed, thoughtful working men,” which made them stand apart, criticising the Church, its rites and institutions; a statement our own experience confirms. The Archbishop of York, at the annual meeting of the Diocese of 1882, told his clergy that the battle now before them was not with sects and heresy, but one waged “for the very existence of Christianity itself;” whilst as regards that test, “the Communion table,” the Bishop of London thought that only 12½ per cent. of the population of London came to the tables in 1875, which we very much doubt, especially when we find Cardinal Manning saying in August of the same year, that only 2 per cent. of the population of London and Berlin attended any Church at all. In 1878 the Home Mission of the Free Church of Scotland reported that all the agricultural laborers of Scotland “live in a state of Heathenism and immorality;” and in 1877 another Church body in Scotland gravely asserted that “there were not a dozen Christians in Skye,” though the popu- lation of that iland is aboot 24,000. Much the same could be shown in the case of Mahamadans and Jews, so that only a small percentage of out 648 millions of “Believers” can be reckoned upon. In Arabia, half to a quarter of the agriculturists, especially along the south coasts, are still prac- tically Sabeans, whilst of the multitudes in the Indian archipelago classed as Moslems, Mr. Crawfnrd, long a British Resident there, shows in chap. iii. of his second volume, that beyond observing the festivals, &c. (because these fitted into their old ones), the people were still nature worshippers “or altogether indifferent to religion.” Of “the lower orders,” he says, “they know little, and are careless about these matters,” and from personal experience, as in administering oaths in his Court, he found that “even the name of the Prophet” was sometimes unknown to the so-called Mahamadans, which reminds us of Dr. Norman Macleod and his Glasgow communicants, see p. 246 ante. CALVARY, ITS OMPHE AND HIGH GOD."},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"“Believers” among ourselves. Calvarian Omphe and Emblems. 593therein. Indeed, Calvary is described as “a small eminence or hill upon the greater Mount of Moriah,” and if we remember aright, it is only 300 to 400 yards from the West Haram wall. The first founder of the Calvarian shrines were, say our narrators, “obliged to reduce it (the round eminence) to a plain area, which they did by cutting down several parts of the rock, and by elevating others.” They did not, however, reduce “any parts actually sacred to the touch” as those “on which Christ stood, was derided, or shut up . . . nor the hole where the cross stood (significant remains), and the cave where the Anointed One descended and rose again”—all points which Mithraists would duly appreciate. Adjoining was found “the chapel of the cross and the pit” where the Kurios “was raised up and glorified,” and it was built, say the writers, exactly over “the sacred hole”—a kind of site we thoroughly understand in the east as one holy to the Argha Nâtha. It was here also otherwise appropriate, for it “could he seen from afar,” and it especially looked on the Omphe of the tribe. The “Eminence” represented the Omphean goddess or “Lady of the Cleft of the Rock,” hence Romanised natives raised a statue to Venus here, and placed one to Jove or the Tsur-God down by the revered fire cave. The sacred cleft has some curious characteristics to which phalists attach weight. It was “a span wide, and twice as long . . . and two spans deep, after which it closes but opens again below . . . . and runs down to an unknown depth.”1 This is a very good description also of the sacred cleft to which Budhists make pilgrimages at the ancient Kaiktyo shrines of Pegu, described and illustrated by us at p. 314 from draw-ings taken on the spot. Christians, carrying on an evidently very old phalik tradition say that “the head of Adam was found adjoining the cleft” of the Calvarian Omphe, from which he looked out on the trial and crucifixion scene; so that this cleft was clearly a mythological Agni mandalum of Adam as “the fiery one.” The legends had no doubt a geological base, for fire probably did once issue from or near to this cleft, and Christians still exhibit their celestial fire as issuing on Easter eve from “the tomb of Christ,” preceded by their “Hot” or Holy Spirit. Our travellers of 1697 wrote that after the people had their more solemn processions, they became much excited, and at last took to racing “with all their might and swiftness round the holy sepulchre, crying, ‘Huia, huia’ (this is it) . . . . tumbling and dragging each other,” when a pigeon was seen to flutter about the sacred cupola, and then the maddened masses shouted and clamoured violently, believing the bird to be “a visible descent of the Holy Ghost.” Upon this the Armenian Bishop and Suffragan of the Greek patriarch cut “the sealed fastenings of the door of the tomb,” and entering (like Mithras), shut it after them, when every light was extinguished, and with frantic joy the people shortly perceived the \"holy fire glimmering through some chinks of 1 Calmet, pp. 81 and 77.

Eastern Aborigines. 594door;” and to this fire they rushed, for every family fire must at this season be lit from the holy fire so obtained. The travellers also mention some twelve or thirteen sacred shrines on the Calvarian “Eminence,” which had been christened and rechristened according to the tastes, legends, and gullability of the motley crowds who. had for some fifteen hundred years flocked thither. Jerome says that “great numbers of the brethren came there to live and die,” and Conder shows that the sites for ages “literally swarmed with monks and hermits”1—the most credulous of men whose pious emotions and intense fanaticism the priests and legend-makers had to pamper, if they wished to maintain themselves and the ascendency of their “Holy Places.” Our travellers, although ever anxious to support all Biblical stones, eventually confess, and this after three and a half years of studious and constant examination of the whole land, that it is “a great pantheon of local deities, a jumble of traditions, Jewish, Christian, and Moslem (they should have added Kuthim), showing the various influences which have successively acted on the peasantry.” They add that a large majority of the present tales and traditions “are probably not older than the middle ages, whilst in the main the stories are childish and resemble those current among the Italian peasantry.” “Even the least ignorant of the Palestinians,” they say, “know scarcely anything, whilst the shepherds are very little better than brute beasts;” and there is much matter confirming this as still only too true, in the various reports and volumes which have issued from or in connection with that invaluable body, “The Society for the Exploration of Palestine.” All this may not indeed have been the result sought for, but we should be content when we get facts. The results fairly to be faced are, that Syria and its races are about as unlikely a land and people from which to obtain what is true and good in ethics and religion as can well be imagined. Earnest and pious believers in every Bible miracle and in all its quasi history, have, as the Right Rev. Dr Russell wrote,2 gone there to strengthen their faith, and left with the conviction that “the whole topographical evidence is one tissue of imposture;” but this is not our belief. The topography is fairly good and true to the old Religions on which Christianity has so largely built, but educated Europe has grown beyond such foundations of her faith. With uncultured Christians, European and Asiatik, we see how acceptable the old sites and legends still are, and how thoroughly they meet the wants, emotions and ideas of many millions of people, who are therefore but little removed from the Gnostik religions, out of which our higher doctrinal and spiritual Christianity sprang. It would be all but impossible to get a religion out of Palestine basad upon the truth of certain supposed ancient occurrences. These it is the duty of the historian and not the theologian to investigate and place before us with all their pros and cons, more particularly, when the events transgress the universal laws and order 1 Palestine, ii. 226.  2 The Holy Land, p. 334."},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"Ignorance and Credulity of Syrians. Their Emblems and Spirits.. 595of all nature, and when accompanied with detailed discourses like those in our gospels, on which hang the most momentous issues. Yet we know that it was in days of crass ignorance and credulity, that poor fishermen and credulous villagers first started that great cry which soon filled the world with turmoil and blood- shed, and which, as time went on, evolved superstitions and dogmas which have, according to Draper and others, probably caused more sorrow, cruelty and misery, public and private, than all the other faiths of man. Every supposed trenchant saying of the Founder or of his disciples formed texts ever to be written in the blood of the best and most sincere—the thoughtful questioners and doubters. The religion was avowedly one “not to bring peace but a sword,” and to carry this last into every sphere of social and public life and into hitherto peaceful homes. It professed as its legitimate result enmity between father and son, mother and daughter, sister and brother; and from its inception it has ever divided those most, who were most pious or earnest in their beliefs and hopes. It has not however been quite singular in these respects, though until its birth, mankind had known no such far-searching and systematic intolerance. Like other faiths it has never wholly cast aside the super-stitious rites and symbolisms of its predecessors, but rather cherished these at their old sites and periods of activity, and in Western Asia this is more particularly true. We there find it even still affixing, as holy and magical charms, on tombs and all fond or sacred objects, the old hieroglyphs of the Bădăwin1 and their Kuthite teachers, as the O, +, T, C, C., C-, the equal, =, a double ‡, &c., as the Jews did that old importation from ancient High Asian Meru-opia, the Egyptian Tau. In regard to the religious leaders of Syrians, whom in the language of Europe we should call the Ecclesiastics, Capt. Conder gravely writes, “Some are mad, some fanatics, but the majority are rogues. . . . . They believe in incantations, divination by sand and other means, and in the evil eye . . . . especially in Jans (our Eastern Jins or Nâts) or powerful demons good or bad, the latter kind having for bodies the tall smoke-pillars of the whirlwinds so commonly seen in summer,” recalling to our mind the Great Spirits, the Alê-im or the Aluê, who were described by their ancestors (for all were Arabs) as “a pillar of cloud by day,” and as riding in the whirlwinds and storms of thundering Sinai, and who, according to their legends, slaughtered their fathers by thousands. To appease the Jân, the present population raise emblems of him as “piles of stones about a foot high, called Meshahed,” usually at cross roads, near wells and under oaks or terebinths, on which they hang rags and other mementos, showing that Mashahed is none other than Mah-esh-ed, a stone Siva or Hermes. Many preserve long tufts of hair on the back of their otherwise shaven heads, saying that this is to enable Gabriel the more swiftly to carry them up to heaven, a forced Moslem explana-tion of a hair legend—we had .almost said of Hair Cult, reminding us of the strange 1 Conder’s Palastine, p. 290.  2 Ibid., II. p. 233."},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c. Eastern Aborigines. 596reason Paul adventures as to why women should wear long hair.1 In their Mukāms, though the Syrians have no “standing images” as in pre- Islam days, they appear to have deified conceptions of divers Nature gods under the very appropriate names of Seth, Shem, Ham or ’Am and Noah, at whose “sacred springs” they worship and say that here “the Flood welled up.”2 All believe that “no exertions of their own can better them,” and that “the one thing required is Faith and to follow in the footsteps of their fathers,” and this devout, fatalistic faith-wave of these nomads has constantly surged up from “Arabi the Blest,” and only too powerfully overspread all our Aryan world. After much personal experience of Arabs and their religious leaders, the Palestine explorer remarks that “it is natural to reflect, whether the social position of the prophets among the Jews may not have resembled that of the Dervishes,”3 not that we are here at liberty to apply this remark to the aforequoted mental condition. Our own experience however of Năbês or “Prophets,” from Cape Kumari to the Himâlayas, is very much what the word Năbê signifies,4 viz., one frenzied, impassioned, inspired, or mad upon a certain idea or subject; more or less temporarily and some- times violently demoniacal, or one who works himself into furors when he thinks he sees or communes with spirits or the deity. He believes he can then predict the future with certainty, and is entitled to say and do many offensive and indecent things, as to go about naked and talk of the most solemn matters in a shameless way. Of course Nabes sometimes say what is true and good, but nothing very original, and only utter “revelations,” and predict what any thoughtful and sensible contem-poraries might equally suggest as possible or probable; whilst they say a great deal which wise men would refrain from even suggesting. They are usually great dreamers, and sometimes try like Abraham to act upon their visions even to killing innocent persons, and are occasionally themselves killed as witches, sorcerers, magicians, etc. We see that Saul when he lost his mental poise and came across “Prophets” (Paigham-bars, or men with a message), also took to Nab-ism (if we may coin a word very useful in the East where such fanatics abound), for, tearing off his clothes, he lay down naked all day and night, believing that the Spirit of his gods (the Ale-im) was on him. Nay he tried to commit murder (a. not uncommon phase of Nabism), when “the evil Spirit of Jehovah” (Lord or Bâ-al) troubled him;5 but, like many lunatics, he was at times soothed by music. The Old Testament writers admit that both the good and the evil Spirit of God enabled him to prophesy, and this is still the opinion of most Asiatiks. Thus the Panjabis of to-day repeat a metrical charm: 1 1 Cor. xi. 10. Conder’s Palestine, II. p. 234. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. p. 231. 4 Heb. abn, nba. To prophecy, sing, be frenzied, utter impassioned cries.

Strolling Nab-ism was and is very infectious, as we see in the narratives of Saul and Samuel, and as the Indian Government knows to its cost. The Panjab Năbê Ram Sing, a carpenter, who was held to be an incarnate God, necessitated a small war, and kept a force of 8000 to 9000 British troops in the field during a long period in the year 1867. We cannot acquit even the great founders of faiths like Budha, Christ, and Mahamad, of fanatical Nabism in the fresh young days when “the Spirit of their God” or God-idea was on them. They then felt that the heart was inspired or regenerated, and as it were, “born again of the Spirit,” and this made them throw up all the ordinary attractions of life and retire into desert places to try and serve their god, or idea of perfect holiness. No sacrifice is then too great for “the regenerate one” who indeed “longs to spend and be spent,” body, soul or spirit, in the service of his God or some incarnated idea of the same. The sufferer, for the pious emotionalist is a real sufferer, feels at this time ever in the presence of his Lord, or of his Messenger, and is ready to take immediate action on his ideas or dreams, as did Abraham and Ehud. This last ancient Guiteau said that he had “a message from God,” whereupon he made a dagger and murdered a king, and every Biblicist is bound to believe that “the Lord raised up” this assassin for the dastard deed. So pious Nabês told Jews that their “God of Battles” had commanded them to despoil Egyptians, and ruthlessly murder and plunder the young and old of peoples weaker than themselves, and only now and again to save those who helped or were useful to them, as the harlot of Jericho and maidens of Midian.2 The oldest prophets or Nabês were like those still familiar to us in the East. Thus Isaiah3 had periods of indecent maniacal outbursts, for we are told that he once went about stark naked for three years, because so commanded by the Lord. Ezekiel also says that his God told him to lie for 390 days on his left side and then 40 days on his right side, when he “would lay hands upon him and turn him from one side to another;” also that during all this period he was only to eat barley bread baked in too disgusting a manner to describe. This last command was however, so strongly re-sented that his Deity somewhat relaxed it.4 He however directed Jeremiah to “make and wear bonds and yokes on his neck, as we have seen Eastern Nabes carrying 1 Lt.

Our travellers found a famous column, obelisk or tower on Calvary, “now somewhat ruined . . . and deprived by Saladin of its bells, unsufferable to the Mahometans;” and no wonder, when they knew the symbolism of a bell and its clapper, and saw how Romans and others hung bells upon phali, as seen on the sculptures of Nismes and other places. It is evident that “the eminence” was a “circle,” Gulgalta or G-l-g-l, with a pillar, pale or stauros (not a “cross”), like to the God of the Omphe which Col. Forbes Leslie depicts in Early Races, and which with other similar Calvary-like mounts, are seen in our Pls. vi. and vii., pp. 278, 291, Vol. 1. The Stauros, Lāts, Pillars, or Poles, were common to all old races, ages before the Christian Cross was heard of, and victims were often nailed to this symbol of the deity as a sacrifice to the Pillar-God or his consort. Any Stauros or Column at Cross Roads was usually called a “Cross.” The stress here laid upon the “Hole of the Pit” or “round place” in which the sacred Cross or Stelê stood, is also suggestive, especially when taken in connection with the highly Sivaik legend that Adam here rested till blood issued,4 when he sprang into life awakened by the Son of Righteousness, also when we know that Adām signifies in the East, “Man” or his sign, and that the early Christians called Adam the mast of the Ark boat of Life, as Hindus call Siva the Argha Nāt. Now the Lord Zedek was worshipped here under this Adāmik symbol of a Lāt or stone column, and not here only, but at many places about Hermon, Gerezim, Hebron, &c.,4 although “the Round Eminence and ruined tower” of Calvary as lying close to the Omphe and numphean cave of his Miriam, would naturally be his favourite hypethral shrine; yet we scarcely expected to find it here still marked by his emblem, and “the High God,” and still well known in 1697. Our travellers add that however crowded and numerous the chapels, &c., were “around the Calvary and Sepulchre, yet none encroached on the summit of the rocke . . . . they keep without the altar of Melchisedech,” which is true to-day of every Calvary-like site of “The High God” of India. 1 Jer. xxvii. 2; xxviii. 10. 2 Hosea. ix. 7. 3 [Jahveh commands Hosea (i. 2) to take “a wife of whoredom” by whom he has various children, calling them all by ‘unlucky’ names. — T.S.] 3 Smith’s Bible Dict., Art.

Its Old God. 599We can see how much the Calvary of to-day is changed from that of 1697, for our travellers then wrote, that “where the Sanctuary stands was a clear apace of 10 to 12 yards square, and so high above the common floore of the church, that you have twenty-one steps to reach the top . . . . (whilst) the Holy Sepulchre, which was at first a cave hewn into the rocke underground, having had the rocke cut away from it all round, is now as it were a grotto above ground.” This is invaluable information, and not less so from our narrators jumbling up “Calvary” and “the Sepulchre” in a way not thought permissible by modern archeologists. Facts are however before all theories, and in these statements written on the spot in 1697 by educated and careful men, we see the changing character of the myths from age to age. The Calvarian shrines and those of the “Holy Sepulchre” were then evidently one compact group, surrounded and interspersed with the public and private chapels of various sects, and the cells or abodes of the monks, priests, friars and pilgrims. The ever increasing taxation of the Turk and other causes, made them at one time disperse, when they not only somewhat removed their altars and emblems but the scenes of their favorite legends, to less taxed localities. In 1690 their inter- necine feuds, causing constant bloodshed, became so violent and notorious that the French monarch interfered, and induced the Sultan to hand over the care of the “Holy Sepulchre” to the Latins, since which time, these only can here celebrate public rites, as the mass, etc. Other sectaries have only the right of entry for devotional purposes. The Latins as seen daily tending the numerous shrines, must recall to every Eastern traveller the rites of Shintos, Hindus, Jains, Budhists, but especially the Adi Budhists of Tibet. The same genuflexions, prayings or mutterings, chants and recitations, with tapers, incense, banners, and poles covered with strange mythik but unmistakeable solo-phalik emblems, bells, candlesticks, nay, even mirrors and sacred stones, are all common to these diverse faiths. But, indeed, the whole topographical idea of Calvary, is Eastern, Jovine or Tsădăk-ine, as we should expect when there is a group of caves with sacred fire under “a round eminence,” and a column or “Jupiter Stator” above. It entirely corresponds with these other old Latin shrines on the Palatine, see the drawings and ideas developed on our pages 366-368, Vol. I. Let us look a little closely at the history and character of the original Calvarian god and “Melchi-zedek” his eponymous high priest, for it was to him that Abraham “the High Father” first came in worshipful humility on leaving Ur of the Kaldis and his ancestral idols; and to him again he went when his prayer for offspring had been answered by the birth of lsaac. It was customary among all peoples at some period of their growth to offer, or at least, feign to offer their first-born to the God of Fertility—the “High One” or Maha Deva; and only as human nature asserted its kindly influences over faith or "},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c. Eastern Aborigines. 600religion, did such savage laws fall into disrepute, and the priest gladly accept in lieu the choicest of the flock and first fruits of the field. Abram’s act is here therefore praised as one of faith, of course by a narrator of the transition period; and both sects are pleased by the argument that we must not imagine he had any real intention of murdering his boy because of a dream, else he was guilty of a gross and useless falsehood in telling his people that he and the lad would return after worshipping on Yahuê Yarāh; and the old admirers of ancient Tsădăkism and Yahuism are pleased that the knife was lifted on high to smite the first-born, although arrested by a preternatural voice from the clouds, without which, of course, the father was bound to slay the innocent child. The whole story is probably founded on the well-known rite of the Beni-Anaks, which was enacted at the Vernal Equinox, on or near to this their sacred Shalm.1 It was widely famed as “the sacrifice of Ieoud, or an only son,” that is of some Iyudean or Jewish youth, for like most people they preferred sacrificing a stranger to one of their own children. Especially would they be satisfied with a Yahu or Saturnite, because these worshipped their own gods in Yachaveh and Ra-El, as well as their High God Tsedek, Ier, or Yrāh on his hill of Salvation or Shalm. Long after the days of Ezra, the Jews called Tsadak,2 “the Eternal One, without father and without mother, having neither beginning of days nor end of life . . . . but like unto the Son of God;” so no wonder that their rude Sheik went to his High Priest to beseech his blessing, and to offer “tithes of all he possessed.” Even the cultured Eusebius, twenty-three centuries later, called this “Zedek the express image of Christ”—the new God-idea—and scores of Christian ecclesiastical writers have herein agreed and continued to so speak of, honor and revere Malaki- Tsadak. The Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries looked upon Tsadak as a kind of Shakaina—a “Power, Virtue, Influence,” nay, “the Holy Ghost and the Son of God in human form,”3 a whilst Jews are phalikally correct in claiming him as “an Incar-nation of Shem or Enoch who survived the deluge.” Some said he was Noah, others Ham, but all agreed he was far superior to their demi-god Abraham, “the friend of God,” that is of the Alê-gods, though they knew Tsadak to be a Kanān and the supreme Pagan Jove, or the I-El-u-Shalm. He has continued to annoy and perplex ecclesiastics, both Jewish and Christian, for ages, but especially so since more spirit-ual ideas of God, and acuter critical research as to ancient and modern gods, have arisen. Hence a great deal of foolish orthodox literature has ever and again appeared explanatory of this Tsadak's attrihutes, which attributes are of course quite inexplicable, 1 Cory’s Anct. Fragments, p. 22; Euseb Præp. Evang. i. 10; Smith’s Bib.

"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"Malak-i-Tsădăk. His Worship and Sivaite Emblems. 601taking the language of the Bible and Fathers in the fair and honest meaning of the words. Thus in Smith’s Bib. Dic. we are told that “There is something surprising and mysterious in the first appearance of Melchisedech, and in the subsequent reference to him. Bearing a title which Jews in after ages recognise as designating their own sovereign, and bearing gifts which recalt to Christians tlte Lord’s Supper, this Canaamte crosses for a moment the path of Abram, and is unhesitatingly recognised as a person of higher rank than ‘the friend of God.’ Disappearing as suddenly as he came in, he is lost to the sacred writings for 1000 years, and then a few emphatic words for another moment bring him into sight as a type of the coming Lord of David. Once more, after another 1000 years, the Hebrew Christians are taught to see in him a proof, that it was the consistent purpose of God to abolish the Levitical priesthood. . . . The faith of early ages ventured to invest his person with superstitious awe.” The italics are ours, aud we could urge much in regard to the matter; but the reader needs not now to be reminded of the B-s-r “which was circumcised” and passed through such phases as the Sarks or “Flesh”—the afterwards incarnated Logos, the “Son of Man” and “Son of God,” as we find Tsadak eventually designated, though once “a column on an eminence”! We are assured that the High priest of this “High God” went out and per- formed sacrifices for David in a vale called Shaveh, but the Ezraite recension of the old legends evidently seeks to drop the columnar deity out of sight, eclipsed as he had become by a less gross Nature worship. Epiphœnus and several fathers of the Church, however, grant that M-Tsadak might be “the son of Herakles and Ash-taroth,”1 showing a just appreciation of what is and is not historical! But the black Lingam on “the Mount of Ashereh”—the so-called “stone of Iyub” or Job, east of the Jordan2—still shows us one bona fide emblem of this Asher or Herakles which re-moves all doubt as to the child of such parents, and this “black stone” we will describe hereafter. Of course “Heracles and Ashtaroth” are simply Siva and Chandri or Sun and Moon, that is, the fertile energies or agents of these. Tsadak was also called by Jews and Christians a Hamite, or Am-on-ite and a Jor-Am or Ier-Am, or Iel-Am—a sufficient reason for the Kaldian Abram’s change of name, and for the eminences of holy Shalm being henceforth called Ier-u-Shalm. Salem, says Dr Russell, was a name of M-Zedek, “which the Gentiles made Solyma” and now Solomon! hence as in Eastern faiths, he was the Shemitik Eskulapios “god of Shalm or Health.” The Bishop says that he reigned in Jerusalem for fifty years and was “not improbably the son of Noah”3 ! and Calmet and others tell us that in Egypt he was known as the son of Sidon or Sida who founded that early Phenician capital, as well as Shalm (Jerusalem), which was called after his mother “The Happy One.” As “the son of Sida” we may believe that Bet-Sidi, the ancient capital of Asher (that is Mahā Deva) was called after this “black stone” god, as well as many other Cidis—a name so common in connection with Druidik shrines.4 1 Calmet’s Art.

Eastern Aborigines. 602We are told that in our third century there was “a large sect who called them-selves Melchisedecians,” and who ranked their demi-god even higher than Christ, saying that he was the Holy Ghost, “the Intercessor and Mediator with the angels, whilst Jesus Christ was only so for men; . . . . Christ was only a copy of Mel- chisedic, and his priesthood, only on his model according to Ps. cx. 4.” In Phrygia, the land par excellence of Samothrakian Sivaites, this sect considered all others so unclean, that like their Indo-co-religionists “they would not touch or take anything save from a Melchesidecian.” They did not circumcize, or observe the Sabbath, but simply adored the Zedek as “the Son of God,” affirming also that “Abram so worshipped him, calling him the Messiah or Anointed One,” and truly so, for he was “One usually anointed”! This deity’s successor at Ier-u-Shalm was called by a similar and equally solar term, Âdăni or Adoni-Zedek, and we learn from authorities quoted in Calmet and elsewhere that he had long had a temple in the Grotto of Beth-lechem, adjoining the one in which Jupiter (his later form) was worshipped, for Adonis was “Lord” or Jehovah.1 But to resume our details as to the shrines. Captain Conder, the head of the Palestine Exploration Survey, after much painstaking research, repudiates all connection with “the Church of the Holy Sepulchre” in these words:— “It is a grim and wicked looking old building. No other edifice has been directly the cause of more human misery or been defiled with more blood. There are those who would willingly look upon it as the real place of the Saviour’s tomb, but I confess that, for myself, having twice witnessed the annual orgy which disgraces its walls, the annual imposture which is countenanced by its priests, and the fierce emotions of sectarian hate and blind fanaticism which are called forth by the supposed miracle, and remembering the tale of blood connected with the history of the Church, I should be loth to think that the Sacred Tomb had been a witness for so many years of so much human ignorance, folly and crime.” We can, and with almost perfect certainty, from long and close observation of similar shrines, assure the archeologist that his God never did lie in, or rise from this old Sivo-Kuthite Fire temple, but surely he has not searched long in vain for the place where the real old Kurios mythically rested in this land of Sur or Kur worship. At one of the principal chapels, that of “The Apparition,” Messrs Maundrell & Sandys describe “two Round Stones of White Marble,” on which “stood the Lord and Virgin” on that solemn occasion when “the Lord comforted her,” and this is, as it ought to be, “close to the Sacred Cave.” Here the pious Christian is directed to “prostrate himself and anoint and kiss the stones, and the more fervently and with full faith he does this, the more certainly will he be cured of all maladies, mental and bodily. This or the adjoining oratory is called “the Navel of the Earth,” that universal name and symholism of every old solo-phalik faith, and reminding us of the Omphallos of Delphi as well as of Maha Deva, that centre of the great circle of 1 Cf.

Whipping Posts, &c. 603India, seen in our Plate III. at end of this volume. The Syrian Greeks here represent the navel by a globe, but it is a mere euphemism for both the Linga and Yoni. Close to all these stones, and characteristically placed “in a little cell at the door of another chapel,” near that of the Apparition, is “the Pillar of Flagellation” emblem of the Quickener or Energizing God, and here therefore did his votaries, and now wiser people and good Christians, whip and even grievously lacerate themselves especially at the vernal or Easter fetes of Apolo and Venus.1 It matters not that this so-called “Pillar of Flagellation is a mere fragment,” for so are the sacred stones of the Makan cell, and numerous others we have frequently come across in the East. Both thieves and conquerors often seize these precious symbols, and politically they are of great importance as carrying with them not only the allegiance but pious feelings of conquerors and conquered. It will be remembered that Iberian Kelts or Basks claimed to have got (stolen ?) the Tara stone from the East, as Irish Kelts got it from Basks, and Scotch from the Irish. The Scots set it up in their new home in Argyleshire, but Picts took it to Skone and Anglo-Saxons stole it to set it up as their “Coronation Stone” in their temple on the Thames. So the Măkan stone was seized on two or more occasiona, and it sojourned for 400 years in Eastern Arabia; but on its return, though only a small fragment, as seen in our fig. 290, p. 436, it received, like the prodigal son, a greater place of honor than that one which had 80 long dwelt unpolluted in its Father’s house, for there are two specially sacred stones in Măka. The more chequered the history; and the more fragmentary the fetish, the more hold it seems to have on the affections of solo-phalik worshippers, and we must bear this in mind when we see devotees kneeling beside mere fragments of holy stones, such as abound in all old lands of Nature worshippers. Close to the “Holy Sepulchre,” Zion-wards, Mr Maundrell found the quasi “Prison of St. Peter,” which was no doubt another small Lingam shrine in which had stood a sacred Petra, Petros, or Cephas, but not of “the Fisherman,” though that name is also imported from the older faith and carried even to the Tiber, where “the Fisherman” has also his sacred stone in that old pagan statue so fervently kissed by pilgrims to St. Peter’s. Near to “the prison” stood the “house of Zebedee the fisherman,” where tradition says the Joppa fishers brought their fish for sale, and here used to stand the miraculous iron gate, which “opened of its own accord” to let the Dvārka-Nāth pass through. The Arkite idea is here strengthened by our being told to look up at “a sacred window,” at which a damsel appeared—a legend which Sivaites would explain mystically, “windows,” like doors, having a strange significance. 1 See Calmet and various parts of this work.

Eastern Aborigines. 604Mr. Maundrell describes as in connection with the aforesaid, a chapel over a “house of St. Mark” to which Peter fled; but here too “the treasure” was a hollowed out sacred stone, which the priests said had been used by the apostles as a baptismal fount—more likely a Paphian stone of the old Kuthim. A little nearer Mount Zion, in a beautiful and extensive piece of ground, says Mr M., the Armenians have a church built on the spot where St James the brother of John was beheaded; but judging by the solar terms Iâm and Ion and the whole surroundings, this was evidently a sun temple, and we know that the tribes established these as soon as they were able to build, that is in Solomon’s time. Mr Maundrell well describes a solar shrine. He says that there were here “two altars of extraordinary splendor, decked with rich mitres, embroidered copes, crosses both of gold and silver, crowns, chalices, &c.” There was a wondrous pulpit or throne suitably decked with “a beautiful canopy or cupola of mother-of-pearl and tortoise shell exquisitely mingled;” but the Pala-dium of the shrine was “in a kind of ante-chappel where by the altar were three large rough stones esteemed very pretious”—a Trinity no doubt representing the solar god ideas in Petros, Iam and Ion. The priests of the modernized faith, however, accounted for the stones and their very sacred character, by saying that on one, Moses dashed down the two sacred Ebns on which his God had just written the laws with his own fingers;1 that on the second the same God had stood at baptism, and on the third, had been transfigured! It has been said that any nail is strong enough in credulous times on which to hang a faith, and dropping metaphor, much indeed did the real nails of the cross and the nail on the Latin capital carry in the. way of legends. The triple nails of the old Tri-Sul or Tri-dent were engraved as charms on the phylacteries which every Jew should put on at prayer,2 and nails form the mystik Shin c, on that phalik-looking Mezuzoth which the circumcized must show to the God of Fertility before he will recognize his worshippers. Nails lie at the base of our “Broad Arrow” idea, and “three nails” signify “the implements of the Anointed One’s Passion.” It has often indeed been exultantly asserted that Jews and others had “no images in their temples;”3 but there are images and images; and a strong symbolism differs but in name from idolatry. Like all Satrnites or Ra-Els, it was a necessity of the faith that their great shrine should be “oriented and open at the top and with no roof,” and that every day should be dedicated to some Planet, whilst that to Saturn should be specially set apart for prayer, when. all labor, and matters matrimonial, should be abstained from. 1 Exodus xxxiii. 18.   2 Calmet, Frags, p. 132. 3 Cf.

The Olive. 605Close under the steeper declivities of Mount Zion, Mr Maun-drell was shown over the Arminian church built on the site of the house of Annas, apparently the twin Ionik shrine to the male one last described. Its great treasure was a very sacred “hole in the wall not far from the door” where “the Lord was smitten.” In “the court before the chappel was the sacred olive tree to which he had been chained by order of Annas” —all of which should be dear to the understanding of every student of solo-phalik lore, though our pious visitors and even the local priests were sadly perplexed as to how to explain all this to an educated European. The olive, from its great fructivity and yonish leaves, is a universal emblem of ancient Venuses, and was here a suitable accompaniment to a sacred orifice and a smitten deity, for images of Apolo used to be smitten at Nature’s periods of quickening. From “Annas within the walls,” Mr M. was conducted to a church outside Zion Gate on to the steep ascent of Zion, where was another Arminian church built “on the site of the house of Caiaphas, where too, the gem of the shrine was a columnar stone under the altar— “the very stone” which once no doubt hid away a “Mithras of the cave.” It was 6 ft. 9 in. by 3 ft. “deep, and broad as much . . . plastered all over except in five or six little places where it is left bare to receive immediate kisses and other devotions of pilgrims;” and “here was likewise shown a little cell” to represent the Lord’s tomb and the place where the cock crowed and the disciple denied his Savior. We will by and by see the worship of a similar stone in Japan, which once hid away the solar goddess—a form of the Venus Kwan-Yon, depicted in our pl. xvii., p. 529. On the summit of Mount Zion (a most unlikely place to select for a supper), Mr. M. found a mosk which no Christians might enter; but he says a church existed here with a sacred well near the loved spot where the Holy Virgin breathed her last. Hence we see one of the reasons why Moslems seized this summit as they did that one of similar feminine characteristics on Mount Murê.. In “the vale of death” or “valley of Jehosaphat,” is seen the subterranean spot where the sacred Fire of the tribes was, they said, securely hid away during all the long years of their captivity, and then miraculously resuscitated; showing in this thoroughly Parsi or Pharasi legend (see II. Mac. I. 19 and elsewhere) what good Guebrs as well as solarists the people were. Parsis similarly hid their Sacred Fire near Barōda and Surāt. Not far from the tribal Fire Pit was a Sacred Tree and Virginal Omphe, which Calmet describes as higher and more ovicular than we remember it, but time lowers all such places. At is base lay sacred numphean matters; as, near the Eastern foot, the holy, “Fount of the Virgin,” which was so named, no doubt appropriately in the eyes of the old CHURCH OF SITE OF ANNAS’ HOUSE WITH YONI - HOLED STONE AND SACRED OLIVE.

Dr Russell,1 it “has a kind of ebb and flow, some-times discharging its current like the Fountain of Vanduse, at others retaining and scarcely suffering it to run at all.” Then on the western base of the Omphe lies the healing Pool of Siloam, which is also said to have ebbed and flowed. Only water drawn from it could be sprinkled on the altar at the autumnal Feast of Taber- nacles2 or those Venus fetes of the Sukoth Benoth, at which every male was expected to go to Jerusalem, and every young woman occupy for a time the leafy huts so well known on the outskirts of Eastern cities as “Venus’ bowers.” There once existed a church or shrine over this sacred Spring of Siloam, as should be over all holy waters; see those on Mounts Zion and Murê, but Mr Maundrell found only a tanner’s vat! Looking down upon the Virgin's Omphe and Wells, there is a sort of Caer Idris or Chair of Maha Deo—“a pillar jutting out from the lofty south-east corner of the Haram Wall,” upon which the Kurios is expected to sit when he comes to judge the world. The legend reminds us of the Minê phalange or throne of the Bâlis or Bâal worshippers of Dravidian India, alluded to at p. 488 ante. The Moslem expects his Lord, Allah’s Anointed, to sit here, and the devout Christian hopes it will be his Messiah. The solo-phaIacist sees in it an old Lingam which once stood, as it orthodoxly should, upon the heights overlooking this Mons Pārvati, and other feminine symbols. This is another Lingam-like erection suitably opposite to the above, and adjoining—as a Hermes should—the highroads leading to the city gates and Gan Eden, or beautiful enclousre of Gethsemane. Though popularly known as the Pillar-tomb of Absalom (that “Father of Shalm,” health or joy), it ought to be translated “the Manus” or “Hand” as in the Vulgate, for the Heb. Yad, dy, is usually “the hand,” that is the essential “Weapon” or “Instrument,” }m, of man and the trunk of an elephant3—in fact a Linga. In our Old. Testament it is both a “Pillar” and “Place,” as that which Saul set up on the cone of Karmel,4 Kaldis on the earlier artificial cone or “tower of Babylon,” and Moslems over the Red Palace of their Alhambra and elsewhere. The Yad of the “Father of Shalm,” therefore, standing by the road to the Golden Gate of Miriam’s Omphe, and surrounded by sacred caves, tombs or altars, has the same phalik significance as obelisks or columns at the gate of Eastern temples or caves; as Jove’s column at the entrance of the Delphean cleft, and the Jupiter Stator or Siva the Dvârka Nât, seen in our fig. 161, p. 368, Vol. I., standing at the gate of the old city of Romulus. 1 Holy Land, p. 245, Ed.

Man’s “Hand” and “Foot.” 607At the two eastern entrances called the Golden and St Stephen’s Gate, Mr. Maundrell founel two sacred stones. That at the former “had several impressions which you may fancy to be foot-steps . . . of onr Blessed Saviour’s feet, when hurried violently away to the tri-bunal of his bloodthirsty persecutors.” The other is that on which Stephen is supposed to have died, and, like the first, is the usual veiled Lingam form, such as lonim or Vishnuites adopt in lieu of the forbidden male emblem. It stands very suitably on a prominent hill and city entrance, and faces a cave, into which the saint’s body is said to have been thrown. Similar stones are commonly seen in the East at entrances to sacred places, or cities having very holy shrines within them. This has been a Cave of Venus, Kun or Alita, for not only do Chris-tians of all sects here pray and give offerings, but a Right Reverend author says, in evident amazement, that Turks and Arabs do so also, and insist upon a select portion of the grotto being allotted for their sole use.1 This cave has all the adjuncts of a shrine of Pārvati, being hewn out of the natural rock, ad-joining a sacred brook and “Garden of Grief,” with the ever revered “Tree of Agony,” and divers holy stones around or about it. Hence over this Kund of Kunti, the “Earth Mother,” the new faith built what it proudly calls “one of the oldest of churches.” Bishop Russell and the best Bible dictionaries pretty well give up this supposed holy garden as connected with the Gospel stories, and for good reasons. The stories were clearly fathered upon a site of marked solar characteristics. Thus we see a “holy tree” close to some half-dozen very sacred stones; a “Pace of Agony”or Blood (“boody sweat”), that is where the sacrifices took place, and a cave of Mithras with a trinity of stones, called those of James (Chamesh), Petros and Ion, all solar terms, and connected with the setting or “sinking down to rest” of the Kurios; for he here disappeared, accord-ing to the legends, into the grotto to pray2 that his cup of sorrow might pass from him. The “stones” appear to have been parts of an earth-fast rock, such as primitive peoples preferred for sacrifice, see our fig. 31, p. 91, Vol. 1. It is not difficult to account for the walled-in space of 36 feet said to be the terra damnata on which Judas walked when going to betray his Lord. It was probably the last steps of the poor human victim, “a walk” well known in the annals of Memo, India and its Archipelago, see Mr J. Crawford’s Ind. Archipelago, on “Human Sacrifices.” Here too was the so-called “Stone of Prayer,” on which Christians say Christ wrote his prayer, one more or less known before our era. It was doubtless and old “stone of Testimony” or Adoration. There is another stone here on which the Lord stood, when he received Martha and Mary; also 1 Holy Land, p. 256, etc.   2 Bishop Russell and Calmet’s Fragments. TOMB OR TAPHOS OF VIRGIN.

We may here notice also four sacred caves or subterranean altars, viz. that of “the Prophets,” of “Prayer,” of “the Creed,” and “Cave of St. Pelagia, or Pelag,” near which as usual stood a sacred pillar, denoting that this grotto was an ancient temple. Christian story says Pelag was a Bishop Pelagius of the 6th century, but he has here clearly been fathered upon an old shrine of the Pelasgi, or of Pelag “the Divider,” the son of Eber or Ober, a son of Shem, the old solo-phalik god and male symbol. Fuerst gives Eber a similar signification, viz., the Server, or Impregnator, so that it seems to be a local equivalent for Ob-El, Eb-El or Ab-al, the Hebrew Beth-El, Ed, Ebn, or Stone God.1 It is probable that these tales, rites and symbolisms were only taken up by Christians in the 4th century, when the illiterate and superstitious Empress Helena embraced the faith. With her power and wealth it was possible to establish an objective religion. But let us now ascend the Mount of Olives, although in doing so we still leave below many suggestive and very interesting sacred spots. Olivet appears to have been a sort of gnomon of the whole solar shrines of the Haram, the summit being due east of the temple, so that the rising orb on topping it, shone straight into the Ark of the race and through its two doors out over the holy city, and many of its sacred and oldest shrines. Olivet is still famed for divers phalik euphemisms. It is crowned with a round church in a round courtyard, under which is a sacred cave, and is by far the highest point all around.2 On Olivet did the Shechina or Glory of Yahue or Elion the Sun-god rest, “when for three and a-half years it departed from sinful Jerusalem,” and from hence, as Captain Conder reminds us, did the first beacon flash in the moonless sky to proclaim the important fact to their far Eastern brethren that their early moon deity had arisen over the sacred city; and here the red heifer was sacrificed with all priestly pomp and solemnity as it used to be to Set, the Western Siva. According to a Targum, from this holy mount the Ionê or Arkite Dove plucked the olive leaf which announced recurring joy and fertility, and from the olive trees of Elaiôn were gathered the boughs and leaves to form the Tabernacles of the revellers, and the “booths” of the courtezans who annually assembled at the autumnal festival to celebrate Venus’ rites, as queen of all fruits, and especially of the olive. Only with its fertilizing oil might kings be anointed and altars lit, and only its wood be used to form the solar Kerubim and the sacrad doors and posts of the Ark of Life; for these parts represent the ∆, delta of the Dvârka-Nât. Originally no doubt the Mount was named, not after the olive, but some form of 1 Cf. Gen. x. 21-25; Neh. viii. 7; x. 10: Fürst’s Heb. Lex., p. 1006; Calmet and Smith’s Bib.

Thus Elaia or Elâa was the consort of Eleon, or Osiris, Helios, Eleus, or Jove; and Elaia (an “Olive”) was the Delian Apolo’s grand daughter, and all Elain’s mounts were solar. Elâra was a form of Terra and consort of Zeus, and the olive, so sacred to Athena, was believed to have in this way a divine name. The Arabs call the whole range of OIivet, Jebeles-Zeitân, and Hebrews Hr-e-zitim, from Z i t an olive, but Luke caned it Elaion—the Greek for an olive plantation. Everywhere. throughout Palestine we come upon shrines and stones sacred to “Elias,” that is, to Helios, though popularly held to mean Elijah, Heb. Al-ié or Ali- hu—whyla the Allah of Arabs. Thus along the same range to the south we have a convent founded, because there here stood a sacred stone on which Elê or Ali is said to have rested, and it still shows the impression of his body.1 All this accounts for Elaiôn being selected in Solomon’s time (when the race became civilized enough to build or appreciate the building capacities of the Benê-Anaks), as a suitable place for the solo-phalik shrines of their Elohê, that Theos on whom Christ cried when dying. The worship of Jehovah or Yahuê probably belonged more especially to Mount Murê; and that of Elôhim or the Alê-gods to Olivet or Elaiôn.2 No doubt long before Solomon’s time the Alê-gods had here the usual primitive rude unhewn altars. The worship would become more specialized and pronounced when the building era of the race arose, and it was then that Milkom and Chemosh were suitably enshrined, on the east front of the city. These remained the cherished shrines of the Yahus for some 400 years, till the iconoclast Josiah arose—soon to be swept aside as a disturber of the orthodox faith. Not till the Captivity probably was the mountain planted with olives, so that the present name has no bearing on the mythology we are investigating. Near the village of Siloe on Olivet stood a temple to Chemosh or Khem-Esh the god of Egypt and Moab, the Keltik Hem-esh or Iam-esh and our James; and here too was Solomon’s palace, where “dwelt his strange wives,” which Yahus certainly need find no fault with, seeing they took wives as freely as they dared from all peoples they came across, and gave also unto their Yahuê.3 Their Prophets thought fit to afterwards condemn this honored demi-god of the tribes, and to therefore call Olivet “the Mount of Offence;” but we cannot believe the people did so, seeing the temples here existed for probably 1200 years. The whole hill maintained its character for similar “Holy Places,” each faith adopt-ing those of the former as soon as they seized the sites; and here the Empress Helena probably first made Christianity possible. She is said to have been the first to destroy the upper temple of Milkom or Kemosh, which must have stood on one of the summits of Olivet (thore are three,) lor upwards of 1300 years; and we may be quite certain that it therefore fairly represented during all these centuries the faith of 1 Right Rev.

The Empress, we are told, removed two sacred pillars (Phāli ?) of Khemosh, and erected on their foundations her “Memorial Church of the Ascension;”1 but Moslems equally valued this site and shrine, and it is now one of their principal mosks for the worship of Allah or Alê—so great change from its old lord, the Ela, Eloh or Elion of Northern Arabia. Within the cupola (24 feet in diameter) wrote Mr. Maundrell, “over the very spot where were set the last footsteps of the Son of God upon earth,” was a hard stone with a footprint, but its fellow “had been removed from hence by the Turks into the great mosque upon Mount Moriah,” so that it is clear that these were old emblems of the Mahā Deva of ancient peoples, precious alike to ancient Jew and Gentile, Christian and Islāmi. We should perhaps inform the untravelled reader that Syrians have here been, as a rule, very complaisant on these points; indeed, “Mussalmen say prayers,” wrote Ali Bey,2 “in all the Holy Places consecrated to the memory of Christ and the Virgin, except in the Holy Sepulchre, which they do not acknowledge (for it is not Ionik but Sivaik). They believe that Christ did not die, but ascended alive into heaven,” and of course they knew as much, or more of what happened in their own land, as the unknown Gospel writers of the 2d century did. The cupola shrine of Olivet and its pădă pūja or Foot-worship was of course Ionik, but the Pillar God’s shrine was as usual close by, for writes Mr. Maundrell, “a little way northward on the peak” or very highest summit of Olivet, there stood until two years ago, a high tower which Christians named Vri Galilæi, credulously believing that it commemorated the spot where the two angels appeared to the apostles—“the men of Galilee,” to enunciate the ascen-sion and descension of their Kurios. But let us now leave Jerusalem for the south. Hebron was probably the oldest of the holy places of Arabian Sabeans or ancient Aithiopes in the Aram of the Benê-Anaks, and here Tree and Phalik worshippers had long tarried, both as Turano-Sethites and Kuthim of Shemitik characteristics. Its caves and “high places” were exactly what the stone-loving troglodytes of Petra would select when they passed northwards. According to the writing called Numbers, of say 630 B.C., Hebrun, or rather Chabrun, was founded by Kanāns before Zoan in Egypt,3 and from it emanated the civilization and agricul-ture which Shemites succeeded to. The present population of Habrun consists of 17,000 fanatical Moslems, who will not tolerate a Christian, and only some 600 Jews—compressed into an obscure corner. The religion is Ancestor, Cave and Tree worship, with other symbolisms now quite 1 Calmet Frags., p. 66. 2 Right Rev. Dr. Russell’s Holy Land, note, p. 295. 3 Gen. xiii. 18; xxiii. 2; Num. xiii. 22.

The old Anakim city, called Kirjath Arba (or rather Karit Ārbo), was even down to the 4th century B.C., said to have been long ruled by one Arbo, a giant among Baal-ites, the father of the Anakim, and one of the four great patriarchs of which Adam was the first.1 Chabrun was probably a later Abrahamik founder, a Sethite or Shemitik ruler, for close to the Ain-el-Yudi is a very ancient Jewish “Tomb of the nine graves” or Kokim, called the Kabr Habrûn or “grave of Hebron.” The Anakim name may have been Kur-i-ath Arba, or Sun-town of Arba, for though tyrq K r i t, is “a city,” yet like Ilu, Ur and other words for a town, it would be so only because originally the centre of the faith of Solarists clustering around their Kur or Arba. We know that Kirjath was a pre-Israelitish name, and that Arba was the name of a deity like Baal—a god of dual sex, regarding whom Inman and others have some good matter.2 Thus the prominent conical hill of Soba where the Love fetes or Autumnal revels of the Sukoth Benoth took place, used to be called Kirjath Bâal and K-Jearim or Yorim; or, as Captain Conder says, “Ba-alah,” of which more hereafter. The Haram or sacred enclosure of Hăbrun is within lofty walls, 112 feet E. and W., by 198 feet N. and S., and architecturally precisely like the old walls of the Haram on Mount Moriah. Within is the mysterious cave of M-k-p-l-ê or Mach Paleh —probably Mah’ Palag, the Divider, or “Great Palag” of Genesis, though more likely a form of Phăl or Phalas, the “Fruiterer,” the Arabian Fala and Greek Pallas. No European has penetrated this cave, the principal tombs in which partake of a Mithraik and Trinitarian character. The oldest triad is that of Abrhm, Shrê and Yokab; to which northern Shemites have added their special trio of Ts-châk, Rebekê and Laê or Leah, and placed the bones of Joseph (stolen from Shechem) in a shrine against the outside Haram wall. Shrê is a generic word for the excellent one or “Woman.” About half a mile to the N. W. stands Abraham’s “Sacred Oak” or the “A-l-n-i of Mămrā”—an idolized tree, the supposed site of which has often varied; according to Jerome it stood beside Abram’s house at Râmeh, two miles from Hebron, in a Gan-Eden or walled-in garden. In the time of Constantine it was like our “Christmas trees,” hung all over with images, charms, and other valuables, one of which was a picture showing the “Lord Almighty,” the Al-shadi and Elohim, eating veal and bread, &c., as described in Gen. xvii. and xviii. But when a hatred of this rude image worship sprang up, a great church was built around the Oaken God, just as Basks (the Ebri or Hebrs of Spain) built the one illustrated in our PL XV. 11, p. 405, around the two stone emblems of Mercury. This deity was well known to all Jews and Syrians as Markulim,3 and to him they threw and still throw stones or erect karns, Chaityas, or heaps around trees. The church and perhaps the tree was burnt down in the 17th century, which is 1 Josh. xiv. 15; Conder’s Palestine, p. 84. 2 Anct. Faiths, I. p. 278; Josh. xiv.; Fürst’s Lex.; Conder’s Pal., Appen.

Eastern Aborigines. 612possibly the reason why one nearer to the Haram has been selected. It was customary for Arabs, Jews and Christians to hold summer fairs under the revered tree, and each to worship, said Dean Stanley, with his own rites. Under many a similar tree have we gone to see similar marketings and religious observances in the East. This present “Oak of Rest” or Balûtet Sebta, is a magnificent tree with branches some 50 feet long, and probably, says Conder, 200 years old, but tradition proclaims it to have been “there from the foundation of the world.” It is associated with Adam, nay, is said to symbolize him, thus raising him to the mythological rank of all oaken Joves and Thors. Here too, is the grotto hewn out of the live rock where Adam and Eve lived, and a sacred spring, the Ain-el Yudi, which say the myth makers (grasping at a false etymology), enabled the Alê-gods (Elohim) to make the Â d m or “Red Man” out of the adjacent red earth. What he made was such an Â d m as we see the God Amon making in fig. 11 of our PI. XIII. p. 316, which though only a Linga is called “a man” and Osiris, and is such an Adamos as was worshipped in Samothrakê. This autumnal festival was celebrated in the valley gorge leading up to the peculiar cone of Soba, west of Jerusalem, where sweet shady orange and olive gardens still tempt the inhabitants of the city to go for an afternoon siesta; and here “the daughters of Jerusalem were encouraged to come out and meet the youths who were celebrating the newly acquired purification from sin, with palms in their hands and songs and dances. . . . . Twice every year this festival of maidens took place.”1 Each young Israelite came with his lulab or palm branch in one hand, and a citron (that suggestive first apple of Eve) in the other.2 “Though all the Hebrew annual festivals,” says the Biblical Dic-tionary writer, “were seasons of rejoicing, the Feast of Tabernacles was in this respect distinguished above them all . . . It was called by the Rabbis ‘The ch-’g’ or festival, and it was a proverb that—‘he who has never seen the rejoicing at the pouring out of the water of Siloam, has never seen rejoicing in his life.’ ” We have elsewhere noticed why this virginal font of ebbing and flowing water, was here probably selected; for these harvest rejoicings are always connected with virgins, and are usually rather loose and promiscuous love fetes. Plutarch rightly calls this festival “the Jewish Dio-nusiak or Thursophoria and Kraterophoria,” and Tacitus held that the people were unbridled in these matters.3 As usual the fetes opened with religious excitement; but all the meetings were in the Women’s Court, with music, singing and dancing, after which came eating and drinking to excess, with or without “the loins being girt.” The flesh-eating festival of Aaron’s Golden Calf or Cone was such another fete, when the revellers, more or less nude, sat down, says the inspired writer, “to eat and drink and rose up to play;”4 on which the pious annotator in Bagster’s Compre-hensive Bible says, that “it is highly probable they sacrificed after the manner 1 Conder’s Palestine, I. p. 26. 2 Smith’s Bib.

On the feast day of the Passover, both men and women indulged in “a feast on flesh,” followed on succeeding days by fish, rice and eggs, with wines and spirits. These last, says Captain Conder, are freely partaken of, after which come hymns and impromptu singing in the dim light of a few candles; when the day ends with no doubt these “unseemly things” from which apostles in the earliest days of the new faith, begged Christians to abstain. When the sun sets on Gărăzim on the 15th of Nizan, and all western peoples are celebrating their Easter rites, “the man of God”—the High Priest of all Northern Palestine, gorgeously arrayed as a solar priest should be, in scarlet, white and gold, in honor of the Ascension of his Lord—mounts a large and sacred stone in the midst of the stone circle of Gărăzim,2 and goes through divers very imposing rites and sacrifices, essentially solo-phalik, having first prepared his people for the same by sundry suitable readings of the Law from a sacred scroll, which has long been a fetish of this tribe. This reading is a sort of purificatory ceremony not unneeded after the gross rites of the booths. The Samaritans hold that their Messiah, the El-Mahdi (El, the Maha.-Devā ?), “a guide and restorer, will some day appear on Gerezim near the twelve stones,” or Asherah Balatat (significant name, from Balut the oak or “robust one”), and that he will draw forth “the Laws of Life, the Commandments, the Golden Vessels and the Mana”—all very mythological objects.3 By Gărăzim is shown Jacob’s Bethel, the Sacred Cave of Măkădê (Pan ?), and the stone by the oak of Joshua, that great sacrificer “at the hill of foreskins.” Adam, Seth, Noah and Abraham are all here represented, and many hold that on Gărăzim the latter sacrificed the ram, and that this was the only mount which was uncovered by the universal deluge, also that its fetish, the Torah, is the only unmutilated Law of God which has come down to man. Nazareth, the supposed home of Jesus, has two specially holy spots, the Grotto of the Annunciation and the Virgin’s Spring, that is a Right and Left hand shrine, just as Jerusalem. Christians call the under-ground chapel with the two Sacred Pillars, “the Holy Cave of the Annunciation.” It had its left or Ionik form in that half which is sacred to the Virgin as the place where she met with the Fertilizer. The inner cell of the grotto adds respectability to the story by being dedicated to St. Joseph, but the vestibule near the Virgin, appertains 1 See our Tables I. p. 427, and Index Headings. 2 Conder’s Palestine, I. pp. 55, 58. 3 Ibid. pp. 58-70.

The old worship is that of Heaven and Earth, Ouranos and Ge, and reminds us of that cell with the Yoni-stone lying deep in the base of the Ripon Cathedral; in both cases the upper exoterik worship has been founded like the structures on the lower esoterik foundations. Nazareth seems to have been unknown to O. Test. writers, and evidently grew into notoriety owing to the Christian tale being fathered upon an old Sivaik shrine. Christians have probably trimmed the chapel into its present cruciform state. At the intersection of the arms of the Cross are the two granite pillars, two feet in diameter and three feet distant from each other. They are not necessary towards the support of the rock-hewn roof. The hanging one, called “Gabriels Pillar,” is the treasure of the shrine, and is said to be suspended exactly over the spot where the angel was when delivering his message of love to Mary;1 that is, this “heavenly column” represents the fertilizing agent of the Creator. It is well-illustrated in that Venetian picture of the Annunciation given on p. 483 ante, by “the heavenly ray” which also there reaches nearly down to the Virgin mother. Those Angel stones, of which we have pointed out many in front of the sacred caves of Jerusalem, are always mixed up with tales of maternity, the Earth mother, Agni, Gabri-El, or other agent of the Fertilizer. Gabriel has in the Nazareth cave a special “High Altar,” and is associated, says Captain Conder, with Joachim, a name which occurs in various readings of Eliakim—a husband of Anna, the mother of the Virgin, and suggestively meaning “Eli or Jah has set up.” Gabri-El is the Michael or Mah’ Kāl of Europe, and the idea of the whole Nazareth shrine is clearly the same as that of the Bask shrine (PI. XV. p. 405), where we gee St Michael in a “High Altar” between two columnar sacred stones. These would fairly represent also the two stones of the Aryan Indra, by which this God produced “the fiery ones,” that is men. The darkness of this Syrian cave is spoken of as appropriate to “the Secret God,” who, the people say, “hath no need of light,” and he so appears also far down under Indian temples, where we have crawled through dark Iow passages to see that esoterik emblem which is hid from the public gaze; vide our fig. 4, p. 39, Vol I., of both symbols. Though a picture and recess represent Joseph on the spot where his wife conceived, yet this Saint’s Workshop, over which is a chapel, is in the town, and here also is a sacred Rock, the Mensa Christi or “Christ’s Table,” over which is reared another chapel. The “table” is a huge block of natural rock, ten feet in diameter and three feet high, like to a nether millstone, and suggestive of the God of Lechem or Beth-lechem, or the solar 1 Conder’s Palestine, I. p. 142; Bishop Russell’s Holy Land, p. 329; and our Vol. I. p. 248.

But the shrine, without which there would be no Nazareth, is that over the Virginal fount, and of course dedicated to Gabriel as the Western Dvârka Nâtha, whose high altars are ever over “Doors of Life,” and intimately connected with all Numphean matters. This fount is as usual also deep down below the floor of the church, but the holy water is led up to the left of the high altar for the use of pilgrims. All Palestine, Moab and Syria, East and West, abound with old stone shrines usually called Druidik. Captain Conder has been lately counting them in hundreds, and his Reports1 are perfect repertories of most important facts, which however, we must leave for discussion in another volume, as this was in the press before his latest and most valuable discoveries reached us. Mr Oliphant, an experienced traveller, who has given us the result of a hasty run through the trans-Jordan districts in his Land of Gilead, also found quite a plethora of dolmens, circles and such like erections, regarding which however, we have not space at present to enter. But we must notice his description of the black phalus on the Sivaik cone of Tel Asherah, to the north of the Ail-un or Ajlun kromlech groups, which Jacob may be thought to have initiated with those Galeeds and Mastbês which formed so important a part of the Nature worship described in the last eleven verses of Gen. xxxi. The black lingam is known as the Sakra Eyub or “Stone of Job,” and reminds us of much strange matter regarding this tried servant of El, Elohe or El Shaddai, or rather of Al, Aluê, hwla, and Al Shădi; which ydc, is “the Sustainer, Field, Producer and Foundation” of all things. He is the true God or lord of the Ebn Shatiê or “Foundation Stone of the World” enshrined on Mount Moriah,2 and the radix of which is Shăt, “the Pillar or Post” emblem. The interchange of the hard d and t is very common with Easterns, so that Al-Shadê = Al-Shăt, “the Almighty,” and thus Job’s God becomes our Indian Mahā Deva. The Septuagint Greek describes Al-Shădê as “the Woody or Feculent One,” Hulodes, probably because Job found him usually symbolised as a lignum penis. But Al, or its variant lya, Ail (often pronounced Il), signified “a Post, Oak and Pine Tree,” as well as a “great Ram, wild Goat or Stag.” Thus Ajl-On or Ail-Aun, }wa lya, would be so named as the district where all these sacred Lingam symbols of “the Ram Gods” or Alê-im, abounded. As in Arabia, Alăt and Falā are terms for the faacinum, so with these old Hebrews the Pine tree was Ala, ala, and the Oak, sacred alike to Jovists and Jehovahists, was }wlya, Ail-un, “the Stout One,” or upright creating father, and the Sada or Sadê of Phenicians. Indra, Siva, Vishnu and other “High Gods” were known to Hindus as Shadā-tana, Sada and Sana (Saturn), and with Arabs Sada or Hama was the sacred 1 Palestine Explor.

In Egyptian, Sab, Seb, Saba or Shaba were terms for a serpent, the sun and “early form of Amon,” the base of which probably lay in Sa-Ab, “Father Sa,” “the One,” “the Solar Lord.” When feminine, Sa is the mundane egg and last syllable of Isis or rather Is-Sa. It is “the eye of heaven,” and the root of the solar faith name, Sabeanism, from which developed Shams of Shem-ism. The Aryan Saba-in or Sabines, called the solar serpent God, Sabu, taking him from the Phrygians or Dio-nusian Pur-gi, or Solar Fire worshippers, who got him from the Turano-Kushian Bar-chus or Bakchus, known Saba-eus, Saba-Zeus or Sabazios. They shouted at “his glorifications,” Saba-oi, which Hebrews kept up in their cry, Sabi, “glory,” and Sabaoth, “the Glorious One”—repeated by Christians in their Te Deum shouts of “Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.” The God of Job and his friends is essentially Al-Shadê, or simply Al, Alê or Aluê—the singular form of Alê-im, which we wrongly pronounce Eloh-im. Yahuê is rarely heard of, but Aluê is called by Job his Tau sign or “Desire;” and “the chief of his ways”—his incomparable creation the Bemuth, is described as a great water monster, whose pachad, “tail,” shaker or phalus, “is like a cedar,” and to this monstrosity is devoted forty-four verses of exaltation.1 It reminds us of the water monsters of the gods of the Nile and the Ganges, and of that on which Siva is seen riding in our figs. 303, 304, p. 454 ante; his “tail” is fitly represented in the great black column of Tel Asherah. This Sakra Eyub stands in the midst of a ruined temple some ten feet high over the debris, and is clearly the God of the shrine. Mr. Oliphant says it is an undoubted “phalik emblem and centre of Bâal worship, and still regarded with great veneration,” although the glans or apex is broken off.2 This injury shows its importance in the eyes of both the destroyers and worshippers. No Eastern student would require to be told that the cone of Karmel rising abruptly to 1740 feet above the Bay of Akre and rich meads of Sharon, was worshipped as an emblem of the solo-phalik god, the Kur, K’Ur, Kar-El, Karn-El or Kar-Mahâ-El of Solarists. We have still his counterfeit obeliskal emblem standing on the plains by the lovely Bay of Akre, similar to that classic one of Mars erected on the Campus Martius under the Arkite Sabine Mount of the Capitoline of Rome.3 Such symbols of the Fertilizer are commonly placed on fertile plains like that of Sharon, and near to a sacred natural Puramid or Omphe; see that erected by Nebuchadnezar on the plain of Shin-Ar, near the so-called Tower of Babylon, that on the plains west of Bâal-bek, and those of Paphos on the fertile meads under the Paphian Mount Moriah. The Akre Lingam was, thinks the Rev. Sir George Cox, used by “those Pillared 1 Job xxxi. 35, and xl. 15, to end of chap. xli. Cf. Parkhurst’s Heb. Lex., pp. 573, 580, and Fürst’s, p. 1123.

Karmel was, of course, the proper home for the priests of El-ites, Hel-ites or Hellenes, and other followers of Karnean Apolos, such as El-ijah, Elihu, Elisha, Elias, &c., and others serving the El-Jah or Sun God. The lofty apex was a natural Pura-mid2 or Fire Cone on which Elijah dwelt and called for celestial fire to destroy those who did not always agree with him; and on this same triangular apex do similar Sivaite-like ascetiks—Karmelites and Druses—still strive to serve the Alê-gods, by abstaining from those carnal acts which Alê or Yahuê required from all who would enter his sanctuary.3 Long before Jewish days the Karnean mountain god was here worshipped, and hy many sects. Elijah only “repaired” an older Yahuê’s altar, and “the Elohims’ place of sacrifice and burning” was defined as the south-east peak, where was a holy grotto well and grove, with space sufficient for all sacrificial rites. These were known to the Romans, for Tacitus says the Emperor Vespasian visited here “the deity of the mountain who had neither statue nor altar.” Of course not, for the cone was both, and the grotto his feminine feature, in which however, modern idolaters have in their ignorance set up their Virgin idea—the Madonna del Carmine, and on the cone itself, a high altar, with a wooden statue of their “High Father” or Yahuê. Only, however, to the male god-idea are offerings usually made. Buckingham says that in the Madonna’s cave was a stone altar and picture of the deity’s arch-priest, Elias—“a kind of vulcan leaning on a wheel (the sun ?) with fire and other instruments of sacrifice at his side”4 —another proof of the Sun and Fire worship which pervaded all Elohimism. But we have also Delphian and Pythonik characteristics in this Beth-El, for the cave, like that at Delphi, is called “the snake’s abode”—the El Haiyeh5 or Puth-On—a highly phalik term in Puth, Put or But. It is the same as Bud and Bod, the Quickener or Energizing Spirit—when male, “the opener of the Dvāra” or door of life, and when female, the Beth or “dwelling-place of the gods.” In Egyptian, Put is a “bow or 1 Myths of Aryan Nations, II. pp. 144, 372. 2 The Phenician God of Fire was Pur, and Manê his obelisk or man-sign, and Kopts called “the Sun’s splendor,” Piramona, originally Pi-Rā-me? “the oracle of great RA,” or “a divine place or height” suitable for the worship of Ra. See Adler & Rossi on Pi-rama. Statues of kings and priests, says Kercher, were called Pir-omes, and the LXX. translators called the Stêlê and Matzêbê, a Puramis—the Greek form of the older Turanian word. Sabeans said the Puramid was sacred to Shei, Shiit, Shat, Seth or Hermes, and they sacrificed to it cocks, black calves and incense. All this points to the Ebn Shaté and Al-Shadê God of early Hebrews. 3 Lev. xv. 18; 2 Kings xviii. 30. 4 Bishop Russell’s Holy Land. 5 Conder’s Palestine."},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

So in Hebrew we have Badā and Brā, which last is the second word in the Old Testament, and denotes “the creative action of the Alê-im or Demiurgik gods.”3 The womb was in Egyptian the But or Bat, and its representative was Buto or Pasht, the moon and salacious cat goddess. The Greek Apolo-Puth-On, was the Vernal Quickener or Increaser. Our Polyglot Glossary will deal with all such details, yet we must before closing this volume say a word as to that theory which has stood its ground well but too long, viz., that “there is no original relationship between the Aryan and Shemitik families of speech.” This old law must be seriously modiied in face of modem research and later results than the original announcers had attained to. It long seemed an impregnable philological position, but for some years past it has been assailed successfully, and many of its adherents have retreated along various lines, and a very large but too silent class of rising students now thoroughly distrust it. Lately the attempt has been made to establish it on what may be termed geographical grounds; as that there can be no joint parent, because the home of the undivided Shemitik race was in the deserts west of the Euphrates, whilst the Aryans belonged altogether to Central Asia. These volumes have, we trust, shown this argument to be erroneous, because founded on an imperfect knowledge of prehistorik times.4 We grant that the differentiation of languages occurred in well-defined geographical centres, but this is only saying that languages there became nationalized and classified when the great tribes began to draw together into nations. They thus naturally formed strongly-marked philological centres which we call Aryan and Shemitik, but this was of course a very long and gradual process, beginning from the time when the races broke away from the tongues once common in the birth-place of man—the Turanian or Altaik high Asian home. That period is so vastly distant, that there is only left 1 Gen. xxxi. 52, 53. 2 Chald. Magic, chaps. xiv., xxii. 3 Fully treated in Man’s Origin and Destiny, p. 60.

We can therefore see no weight in the geographical argument in face of the facts we have advanced in these volumes as to the moves of man, untold ages before Aryans were Aryans or Shemites Shemites. Of course our theory requires, like the Darwinian one of progressive development, a vast period of time, but this is a necessity if we accept the almost universally acknow-ledged facts, that the race arose in one creative centre, and had spread over half if not all the world, before the sub-glacial period, which geologists place at some 240,000 years ago. Many demand an infinitely earlier time for the appearance of man, as the right hand heading of our Chart shows, but without attempting to lift the veil beyond say 10,000 years, we have shown, that well within this period, great building and civilising peoples had gradually poured south and south-west through the Altai, Kush and Kaukasian highlands, and settled over all tropical Asia, and much of the temperate zone of both Europe and Asia, and this thousands of years before Aryans were Aryans. Indeed these were comparatively a modern development, only appearing on the watersheds of the Ganges, Tigris and Euphrates some few thousands of years B.C., and not influencing the west till less than a thousand years B.C. The Aithiopo-Kuths on the other hand, speaking what, for want of a better term, we call Turanian tongues, passed south, settling in India as Meru-opes, Kusis and Drâvidas, and in Arabia, Egypt, &c., as Sabas, Seths or Sethites, Shams or Shemites, untold ages before classifying nationally and philologically. Further we find that from these centres they gradually poured forth their surplus populations, which spread ocean-ways through the geological Lemuria and the Indian Archipelago, even to Polynesia and the Americas. But to return to our immediate subject. The revered river of all this “Holy Land” has been more or less worshipped, or thought to carry with some divine afflation from its sources in the bosom of high Hermon, by the mystik grotto of the old Kuthite Pi-An, P’An or Pan, to its far-away tranquil ford, where a new faith saw the incarnate Jehovah baptized. Along its sacred banks may still be seen wandering Nābes clad in rags or sackcloth and besmeared with dirt or ashes, like to that John, upon whose baptismal act “the heavens opened” and the celestial Trinity appeared—a personified three, and not one; and here it was, said the Edumean wanderers, that the holy stream once Btood still, nay, “rose up upon a heap,” to let them enter upon and sack the peaceful homes of those who had done them no wrong, and had owned for ages its fertile meads and rugged water-sheds. Here is the holy ghât to which Chris-tians now madly rush, like Hindus to the Ganges, and at similar solar periods, to bury themselves in its regenerating flood, which purifies, they believe, soul and body. Well may the Rev. C. B. Elliot write,1 that these “frenzied religious stampedes,” turbulent and “promiscuous bathings, conducted with great indecorum,” are not only 1 Bishop Russell’s Holy Land.

The devotees, with their bishops and priests, descend usually in frantic haste (striving who shall first reach the healing waters), over very rough and dangerous mountain defiles, and in flocks of 5000 and even 8000 persons of all ages and sexes, and are herded, restrained or driven on by cavalcades of scoffing Arabian cavalry led by a governor and his satrapes. Mad, unsympathising heartlessness pervades all, each only seeking his own comfort or happiness here or hereafter, and heedless alike of the weary sick or dying, presses forward, bent only on the salvation of his own wretched soul; such is this race heavenward! As holy Ganga sprang from Siva the “Ganga Dhara,” so the Jordan sprang from the Western Siva—Pan, the Fertilizer of all early nomads, their flocks and herds; and from his vast Lukeo-Arkadian form came the more solarized Zeus and Jove. The child, it is said, killed the parent as in the case of Agni, Kronos, Saturn and others, which means that the coarseness of Panism gradually gave way to the Hellenized or Olumpik faith, just as the Bâalism or Elohism of Jews and other Syrians gradually became spirit-ualized. The reverend editor of Bishop Russell’s Holy Land assures us that there is abundant evidence of the worship and rites of Pan at the sources of the sacred river, and especially on the sculptured cliffs in and about the grotto which still bears his name in Banias or Panias—the Laish or Dan of the Old Testament. We suspect, in spite of the absence of a in the Hebrew tribal name, that the Danites were really Pan-ites, for such vowel quantities were little regarded by illiterate people, nay, still are neglected by our own masses, and our glossary will show how little they were attended to by Easterns. As Elohimists—Aluê, El or Al worshippers—Danites would certainly serve Pan, for was he not the Stone or Pillar God, a son of Hermes of their Holy Hermon, and a Ram God, or one of the Ail-im or Alê-im, whose emblem was the Pine tree, corresponding to its tropical substitute, their sacred Palm? The Jordan goes forth from several rocky orifices by Pan’s grotto, but its largest source is under the vertical cliff of Panias, in which are many natural or artificial niches for images, or those rude symbolik stones which are so well known beside the sacred waterfalls of lndia. Burckhardt and others long ago described numerous sculptures and inscriptions as existing in and around the grotto, which with its strange orifices reminds us of that one fitly dedicated to Venus, at Afka, north of Bairut. Burck-hardt says the largest sacred niche immediately above Pan’s Cave had a statue of the deity, and that after him the river is here called Panias, and the whole mountain—one of the spurs of Hermon—Panium. Along its slopes and crest are sacred groves and altars where, at Pan’s fetes, all sects, Christian and Pagan, assemble to worship in the open air, as the old god was adored in his Arkadian home. These northern Chris-tians indeed assert that it was on this, Pan’s Mount Hermon, and not on Tabor, that their Kurios was transfigured, and Captain Conder offers a natural reason to account for the apparent phenomenon.1 1 Palestine, I. p. 265."},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"The Jordan as Pan’s Sacred River. Its Past and Present Rites. 621But we must close for the present this inquiry into the old faiths of Western Asia. The careful reader will perceive that the conclusion to be drawn from these or any such inquiries (and we must all draw conclusions, for unproductive thought is useless,) is, that those faiths alone suffer which are founded on supernatural stories, old legends and mythologies, the fancies or emotions of priests and devotees, or a priori assumptions of what was or should have been. True religion does not and cannot suffer, for it consists of personal holiness, purity in thought, word and deed; virtuous, willing, nay, loving work for and sympathy with all that concerns the good of man, irrespective of race or nation, not selfishly looking to reward here or hereafter, or fearing any punishment from unjust men or an angry God. For a time perhaps, but only with the very ignorant, the good and true which may be contained in the teaching of “Bibles,” the history and attendant circumstances of which will not stand the test of historical criticism, may seem to fall with the legendary surroundings; but the tendency of this age of exact science, is not to care so much, for the settings of the jewels as for the gems themselves. We value our old mathe-matical biblia, not because Euclid wrote it, but for the virgin jewels which it was the first to tell us of; nay, we are not even quite certain of the author, his time or place, but what matters that? we have tested the gems and found them true through all time, and equally valuable to all peoples. And so do we value the good and true sayings of all prophets; these the world receives though it casts aside the shell or encrusta-tion with which time and divers interests have enveloped them, and accepts only what appeals to the universal sense of the good and true. If none of us can be quite sure of the rightness of our opinions, let us at least be certain of their upright-ness, and hold with St. Augustine—“In necessary things unity; in doubtful points liberty; and in all things charity.” Experience shows that we may not even accept the popular histories of the best and purest lives, for this is trenching on the domain of history which any future historian may upset; but it is not so with regard to such commands as “love one another;” “do as ye would be done by,” &c. We care not whether the groves of Budha Gayâ or the wildernesses of Măkă or Judea first heard these teachings; from whatever quarter they came, the intellect and heart of every good and true man attest their sublimity. We reject none of the literature of our race, and least of all the Bibles or Sacred Writings of mankind, but accept all as part and parcel of our common heritage. We only cast aside, from time to time, that which we find will not stand the searching-out light and science of our age; yet we do not call those who wrote what we reject, impostors or hypocrites, but rather see in their writings a valuable retrospect and warning of the credulous and superstitious times which our race has passed through. We do indeed desire to see the evangelical enthusiast or fanatic checked in his head-strong, or rather heart-strong path, by “the cold grey light of Reason” and severe "},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"Rivers of Life, &c.

Our enquiries have necessarily had a destructive and levelling-down tendency in regard to all faiths; establishing the fact, that man worshipped most where he feared most and comprehended least, and usually covenanted with that God or those sup-posed divine agencies, which gave him bread to eat and raiment to put on, flocks and herds and all increase, and lands flowing with milk and honey. It was hard, however, for him to learn, and few of us have yet done so, that true Religion consists in public and private right-doing, or “righteousness” to Jew and Gentile, bond and free, and a conscientious performance of every duty of our station, be it great or small, pleasant or irksome. So grievously indeed has “Religion”—so called—been misunderstood, that even in the 6th century B.C. the sage Herakleiktos exclaimed, “It is a disease which physicians of the mind must try to heal;” whilst Feuerbach, speaking like our-selves with all the experience of an evangelical convert, says, “It is a radical evil arising from a sick and weary heart . . . the embodiment of some human wish, hope or presentiment . . . and chief source of misery.” But Fichte said, “Religion is knowledge . . . and that state of society is corrupt which requires to call in religious feelings to aid morals;” whilst Kant wrote: “Religion is morality, the looking upon our duties as divine commands, but not in performing only what we consider as merely divine commands, for this is superstition.” Religion, hymned our own late lamented friend, Dr. John Muir, the great Sanskritist, translating from one of the very old Biblia of India, is “ To scatter joy through the whole surrounding world, To share men’s griefs; Such is the worship best and good Of God, the Universal Soul.”"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":" INDEX ——— A.—FIRST letter of Alfabets, a phālus, 534, xxii A, Ar, Ra, or Ram-God; a standard of Aryans, 152 Aar, Aro (Ger, an eagle), Eru (Kaldi, a griffen), 150 Ab, “father,” Lord, Ba-al, 60; (August), sacred to goddess Alāt, 187 Aba, Baba, as male ancestors, 63 Ab-adir, a stulos or stone pillar, 533 Ab-ar, the “Father-god-Ar,” or Al, El, 308 Ab-ar-is, 217; the serpent-god-Ar, 308, 354 Abasi-Ibum, 457 Ab-Elo, 553 Abn, 608; see Ebn, Stone Aborigines, chronological order of, 200; Asiatik, 451, 458 A-bra “Creator,” Abram, 70 Abram or Abraham, planting grove or ashel, 167; meaning of name and his history, 93-101; Ezra’s story, 102; as a patriarchal idea, 173; making oath before an ashel, 177; his servant swearing on circumci-sionis sectio, 177; his sacrifice of ram for Isaac, 30, 183; the Abramik migration, 12; from Sour of Kaldia, or Sehor, 198, 401, 611; an Urite of Kaldia, 198, 348, 528, 577 Abri-El of Meka, a deity, 248 Absalom’s pillar, 171, 608 Abu, xix., xx.

Changes noted in the errata page have been worked into the text, and the errata page itself thus omitted. A few obvious typographical errors have been corrected and in several places missing opening or closing quotation marks conjecturally restored. Except in the case of what appeared to be obvious typographical errors, and in the titles of and quotations from published works by other authors, I have not tampered with Forlong’s non-standard transliterations and eccentric ‘fonetik’ English spelling. His reasons for employing these, and the reasons why they are not followed consistently (mainly unwanted ‘corrections’ by printers) are discussed in the Preface in Vol. I. Footnotes in square brackets are by the present editor; these have been kept to a minimum so as not to disrupt pagination. Some give clarifications or corrections, a few are simply flippant, sarcastic or hostile. Original pagination and layout has been retained as far as possible, the main exception being that rather than attempting to match the typeface I used Times New Roman. Re-set PDFs of Volume I, the “Synchronological Chart” and the “Synoptical Table of Gods and God-Ideas” (originally bound in as foldouts at the end of Vol. II) are distributed separately. My thanks to Jon Sellers of Antiquities of the Illuminati for providing colour images of the big chart and maps (Plates II and III in the print edition, originally bound in at the start and end of vol. II); the former was used as a basis for the re-set; the latter are distributed as JPEG images. The works listed as “in preparation” in the front matter manifested as (a) Short Studies in the Science of Comparative Religions (8vo., London: Quaritch, 1897) and (b) Faiths of Man: a Cyclopedia of Religions (3 vols. 8vo., London: Quaritch, 1906: this being the “Glossary or Polyglot Dictionary”); the former included 10 articles on various faiths titled “Jainism and Buddhism,” “Trans-Indian Religions” (a general study of south-east Asian religion), “Zoroastrianism,” “Hinduism, Vedas and Vedantism,” “Laotsze and Taoism,” “Confucius and his Faith,” “The Elohim of the Hebrews,” “The Jehovah of the Hebrews,” “The Sacred Books of the West” (an account of the compilation, development and translation of the Hebrew Scriptures and to a lesser extent the New Testament) and “Mahamad, Islam and Ancient Maka,” rounding up with a 93-page medley of rather insipid free-verse renderings of various religious and philosophical / ethical teachings from all times and lands of which records were available at the time. Material which was presumably intended for the remaining detailed studies of particular faiths may be found scattered throughout Faiths of Man, whose alphabetically arranged entries range from a single line to thirty-plus page essays; this work was not completed and put into order by Forlong during his lifetime but was assembled from his surviving MSS. by an anonymous editor (who interpolated clarifying and occasionally dissenting remarks into many entries). Citations of a “Glossary” in Rivers of Life may in some instances be elucidated by reference to Faiths of Man under the heading given, though not always. Both Faiths of Man and Short Studies... have been reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, and owing to having fewer detailed and coloured illustrations (Short Studies had three full-page plates of maps, part-coloured, and fourteen inline black and white illustrations; Faiths of Man, a frontispiece plate in each volume; two black and white photographs of the author, and a reproduction of part of a page from the MS.) suffered less than Rivers of Life from Kessinger’s approach to book production (Faiths of Man was also reprinted, with a new introduction, by University Books in the 1960s). An edition of Short Studies ... has been issued by Celephaïs Press; one of Faiths of Man is projected. T.S."}]
