Numerous additional books and epistles also offer guidance and advice in such matters, and it really depends on a multitude of assorted factors as to how the initiate has addressed this undertaking. For example, a student of a Tibetan Rinpoche will undoubtedly take a different approach than a Chela of a Hindu Guru or a disciple in some school of the western mystery tradition. Regardless of the culture, customs, climate or country of any given aspirant, all systems seem to reduce down into three requirements ...

Control merely implies that the physical body, with its aches, pains, hungers and demands for autonomy, is adequately regulated so that it will not interfere with the process of meditation. This regulation is instituted through the practice of Asana. A certain amount of control over the body can also be developed through training in the martial arts, or ballet, or any other dynamic, physical discipline. But for the meditator, the goal is one of sitting perfectly still without distraction by messages of any kind from the physical vehicle. Control of the Emotions AGAIN, THIS \"coNTRoL\" does not mean complete mastery, but it does indicate that the emotional body, with its desires, needs and reactions, is properly ordered so that it will not interfere with the process of meditation. The emotions are regulated through the practice of Pranayama. A considerable amount of control over the emotions can also be developed through astral projection or psychological investigation. But for the meditator, the goal is one of sitting perfectly still without distraction by reactions of any kind from the emotional vehicle. Control of the Mind Tms \"coNTRoL\" does not mean complete mastery, but it does indicate that the intellectual mind is suitably arranged and free of confusion, and that the cultural mind is appropriately free of societal programming and subconscious compulsions, so that neither of these will interfere with the process of meditation. This ordering is instituted through the practice of Qabalah or some similar method of storing conscious data, and by Pratyahara, which really means \"identifying the personal demons and cultural archetypes that are hidden (repressed or imprinted) in the subconscious mind, and then freeing one's consciousness from their influence.\" A certain amount of control over the intellect can be obtained by enrolling in a graduate degree program, preferably one of academic excellence and not one of religious persuasion.

But for the meditator, the goal is one of sitting perfectly still without thoughts or obsessions of any kind arising from the mind. ALL oF THESE orderings and controllings are greatly assisted by the daily performance of an external clearing rite, such as The Ritual of the Pentagram, The Star Ruby, The Star of Force and Fire, The Chakra Clearing Exercise, or any similar ceremony of any tradition that is designed to banish, purify or cleanse one's personal consciousness and environment from disturbances. The Outer Order THESE THREE THINGS, a complex body, a bundle offeelings, and a mind capable of storing data, figuring solutions and conforming to (or outwitting) cultural values, are the \"tools\" that everyone has in his or her \"toolkit\" called the persona (the personality). This personality, the dweller in \"the three worlds,\" is the true outer order of every aspirant, regardless of which temple, lodge, mosque, camp or monastery he or she chooses to enter ... or exit. Each tool is interrelated with the others. Thus, a strong feeling may cause discomfort in the physical body, and the sight of a limping dog may cause sadness in the emotional body. Internally, every feeling has an associated thoughtform, and every visionary symbol and scenario is charged with emotional content. These are so interwoven that the Hindus have a term for it: Kama-manas, or \"desire mind.\" Yet, the aspirant will find it convenient to separate the three aspects in order to individually gain control over them. There is an academic correlation between the three lower centers ( chakras) and these three dominions of the \"lower man.\" These are the three so-called \"centers below the diaphragm.\" But there are also other correlations, and so this is not a one-to-one correspondence.

It literally is a black, electromagnetic \"eggshell.\" This is the limiting factor as seen externally.

At first glance, it appears to be impenetrable, except for hints about the secret methods of the mysterious Adepts. Yet it actually is quite simple for most people ... The Scientific Method SPANNING TWO DECADES, an extensive medical-metaphysical clinical program, instituted by the author, \"treated\" well over a thousand people. At least two hundred individuals undertook the advanced version called Spiritual Insight. Either through a personal appointment, or in courses that were approved by governmental agencies and accredited institutions of higher education, the \"patient\" entered the astral and causal realms. These sessions were enhanced with acupuncture and assisted by a guiding dialog with the practitioner. Here is how it worked ... XV"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The patient was \"anesthetized\" with seven acupuncture needles at specific acupoints. Sometimes two or three additional needles were inserted when the patient was having trouble \"breaking through\" the Veil of Paroketh -but this was not common. After a short induction period of pranayama (controlled breathing), the patient built an imaginary body in a garden. Then this astral vehicle was fully energized by exercising the etheric sensations of sight, sound, smell and touch, and then the effects were described to the practitioner. This dialog was maintained throughout the session, and everyone was always able to keep talking, although it was common for their voices to become distant and soft. The patient was then instructed to cause their astral body to accelerate straight up . .. and up . . . in a classical Rising on the Planes endeavor. This technique is merely cited as background information. What is important in relation to the Veil of Paroketh, are the commonplace results, for certain distinct scenarios came to be recognized ... First, there were those who rose up into \"nothingness\" or a dark, impenetrable fog. Although everyone, except for one person, was able to visualize the garden, there were (only) three people who became \"stuck\" and could not pass through the Veil. Second, there were the folks who had to be verbally encouraged to \"keep going\" like a rocket ship. Despite the dark fog, they would eventually break out of the other side and exclaim, \"I see stars.\" This, by far, was the most common path, comprising around ninety percent of the typical journeys. Rarely, additional needles were inserted in \"resurrection\" acupoints to effect a breakthrough. Third, there were people who, when told to \"go up,\" immediately, or within a few seconds, said, \"I see stars.\" Throughout the entire experience, the person was instructed in what to do and where to go, but they were never told what to experience or see as a result. Yet, essentially everyone saw stars! Each participant was then asked to locate the brightest star in their field of view, to describe its color, and then to proceed directly to that star, penetrate it's exterior, and come to rest in its center. Additional, personal work would then take place, consisting of an inner dialog or interactive vision, wherein pre-stated \"problems\" or \"chief complaints\" would be worked out. xvi"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"This problem-solving was accomplished with the assistance of the person's own \"higher consciousness,\" and the practitioner always stayed neutral so as to not influence the outcome. Fourth, there were some individuals who would engage this procedure so smoothly and efficiently that there was time left over to explore even higher realms. A few were able to withdraw their consciousness into a white point of light, and then radiate out into samadhi. THE POINT Is, it's not usually hard to pass beyond the Veil with a little discipline or some competent guidance. A magickal libation, or a few acupuncture needles, can greatly assist the process. The goal, of course, is to be able to pass through Paroketh, to transcend personal programming, and to connect in meaningful dialog with the \"soul star,\" without artificial assistance or external guidance. That's right! It has to be done in normal, common, everyday consciousness, if it's going to qualify for a grade. Grade? Grades, Degrees and Other Designations THE GoLDEN DAWN PoRTAL GRADE is an initiatory degree whose full title is Lord of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti. It represents the \"outer court\" of the sixth sephira (sphere) of Tiphereth on the Tree of Life, although the initiate does not enter Tiphareth-proper until he or she reaches the grade of Adeptus Minor. The grade is symbolized by the \"fifth element\" of Spirit. The Portal Grade is an \"invisible\" or in-between grade that separates the First Order from the Second Order. The Circle of existing Adepts of the Second Order must consent to allow an aspirant to be initiated as an Adept and join the Second Order. The Second Order is not properly part of the Golden Dawn, but a separate Order in its own right. THE A:. A:. DOMINUS LIMINIS GRADE, the Lord on the Threshold, is a \"link\" between the outer order and the inner order. He or she is expected to show mastery of pratyahara (withdrawal) and dharana (mental concentration), and who is busy constructing the magickallamp which burns without wick or oil. This lamp is the reflection of the \"soul star\" and symbolizes that detached, concentrated image of light which proves to be a key that will unlock the doorway hidden within the Veil of Paroketh. xvii"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"IN VAJRAYANA BuDDHISM, the closest parallel would be the Ngondro,ii where the equivalent of a Dominus Liminis may be seen as a person who is performing the \"uncommon\" or \"inner\" preliminary practices during a retreat.

Well, there's only one way to do that, and he walks up to the gate in the wall around the Zen monastery, where he knocks or rings a bell. Believe it or not, that which follows appears to be true. \"What do you want?\" asks a monk. \"I would like an appointment with the Master,\" he replies.

It ic; not such are rare thing to behold. Let's take a look at a rather commonplace example ... A competent surgeon, young and in his (or her) prime, routinely deals with matters of life and death. When operating, the highest and most highly trained part of his mind will be directing his actions. His emotions, almost always under control in the \"cool\" or \"cold\" surgeon, will be synchronized with the mental directives, and hysterical reactions will not arise. His physical body, still strong, coordinated and healthy, will not interfere with aches or pains, but will simply perform (in a skillful manner) those same mental directives. The same may be said of a successful businessman (or woman), who skillfully negotiates the halls of capitalism, and is able to routinely reap billions of dollars in profit. The same may also be said of any successful person who is able to harness body, emotion and mind into a single engine. THE DWELI.ER ON THE THRESHOLD is a term related to Paroketh, although sometimes with different implications and meanings, depending on who is doing the defining. xix"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Dweller on the Threshold (or Guardian of the Threshold) is a literary term that was invented by the English mystic Sir Bulwer Lytton, and introduced in his book Zanoni in 1842. The term was adopted in Theosophical and other metaphysical circles. The Dweller is a spectral figure, an abstraction of the karmic debit and credit account of every individual. It is the sum-total of the \"evil\" influence that is linked to the age in which any one may live, and it assumes a definite shape for every aspirant at each crisis point upon the Path. The Dweller on the Threshold is a menacing apparition that is further described not only by Madame Blavatsky in her classic Isis Unveiled, and by Rudolf Steiner in his Knowledge of the Higher Worlds, but also by Dion Fortune in both her fictional and non­fictional texts. According to Steiner's teaching, this image will present itself as soon as the aspirant begins his or her journey upon the path into the higher worlds. This doppelganger is a \"guardian\" that stands before the various veils in order to prohibit entrance to those who are not truly capable of passing through. The concept of the black guard in certain initiation rituals is intended to portray this very real, archetypal figure. 11But beware of the black shadow at my side, for he shall drive thee from the life of men, so that thou hidest in dens and caverns from the light1 and thy name shall be lost, and thou shalt suddenly be slain if thou so much as lift thine eyes unto his face.\" iii Steiner also identified two different \"Guardians of the Threshold,\" one being the lesser, while the other is called the greater. The lesser guardian appears at that threshold called Paroketh, and the greater guardian, who appears as Choronzon, confronts the Adept on the verge of the Abyss. The guardian essentially informs the aspirant that he or she will not pass by until this sinister visage is incorporated into the candidate's own consciousness. The guardians are always frightening or disturbing at first, and they serve to protect the student from realities for which he or she is not prepared. The Dweller is also found in Jungian psychology, where the XX"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Shadow or \"shadow aspect\" is a representation of the unconscious mind, consisting of repressed instincts and shortcomings. It is one of the three most recognizable archetypes, the other two being the anima or animus and the pe1·sona. \"Everyone carries a shadow,\" Jung wrote, \"and the less it is embodied in the conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.\" iv Despite the fact that the initiate has been working diligently to reveal and control unconscious personal and cultural tendencies, there is always that which remains hidden .. . until the crisis of Paroketh or the Abyss. The Dweller-Guardian is perceived as a separate, individual being ... always dark in appearance and scary in nature. The people of The Book (Muslims, Christians and Jews) will be quick to say, \"It is the Devil himself,\" which is true, for the Devil is nothing more than the illusion of the individual, separate self. There is no solution other than to become the Dweller. This is true in the case of \"success,\" and the initiate will then be allowed to pass the veil, to step over the threshold and enter the new, higher realm of consciousness. In the case of \"failure,\" the aspirant will return to normal, everyday consciousness, carrying the fear of the Devil, or his synonym, deep inside his or her subconscious -now reinforced, and perhaps made even more subconscious. Such a person is likely to become a fanatic, or a Christian minister, or a Mohammedanjihadist. Of course, the Dweller is not a separate being. It is merely the remnants of the repressed subconscious tendencies of the initiate. There is bound to be a conflict when the Dweller appears. There is an internal struggle with fear that manifests when confronted with buried predisposition. This struggle will assuredly also manifest as a problem, a scenario of conflict, in the outer world. \"Let him remember that the word Dominus Liminis is no idle term1 but that his mastery will often be disputed1 when he knoweth it not.\"\" xxi"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE ARCANE ScHOOL has no formal grade for Paroketh, but it reveals that there is a gap in consciousness that can only be crossed when the personality is in a state of alignment. The Arcane description of the Dweller is reproduced here because of its clarity: The Dweller on the Threshold is illusion-glamour-maya as realized by the physical brain and recognized as that which must be overcome. It is the bewildering thoughtform with which the disciple is confronted when he seeks to pierce through the accumulated glamour of the ages and find his true home in the place of light. The Dweller on the T11reshold1 always present, swings into activity only on the Path of Discipleship when the aspirant becomes occultly aware of himself, aware of the conditions induced within him as a result of his astra( glamour1 and aware of the maya surrounding his entire life. These three conditions are seen as a whole and the term \"Dweller on the Threshold\" is applied. lt is in reality a vitalized thought-form -embodying mental force, astral force and etheric energy. The Dweller on the Threshold does not emerge out of the fog of illusion and glamour until the disciple is nearing the Gates of life [Parokech ]. Only when he can catch dim glimpses of the Portal of Initiation, and an occasional flash of light from the Angel of the Presence who stands waiting beside that door, can he come to grips with the principle of dualitY/ which is embodied for him in the Dweller and the Angel. The day will surely come when you will stand in full awareness between these symbols of the pairs of opposites1 with the Angel on the right and the Dweller on the left. May strength then be given to you to drive straight forward between these two opponents who have for long ages waged warfare in the field of your life1 and so may you enter into the Presence where the two are seen as one. vi xxii"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE ACTUAL SIGNAL of\"admission\" to the Dominus grade, is the first true result of meditation - the first dhyana. This is what is represented by the lighting of the magickallamp.

The true path begins when one gets their first, first-hand glimpse the Light of the \"soul star.\" No terminology, belief or man-made law is able to deny that the aspirant has \"seen the light.\" This \"first-light\" is followed by a long journey through the Tibetan Bardo of Hallucinations, called Passing through the Tuat in our western civilization. Here, the \"guiding light\" flickers in and out of sight through the foggy glamor and illusion. In this Dominus grade now under examination, the sun (at Tiphereth) is just below the sunrise horizon (the \"horus-zone\"). Ra is said to be in the final chamber of the Tuat, under tow from human and elemental forces, accelerated by the power of the wings of Kephra, the midnight beetle. The external projection of the magickallamp is seen in the \"morning star,\" appearing as a herald just before sunrise. XXIII"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Real-Time Manifestation REGARDLESS of any external recognition, or initiation ceremony, or empowerment, the grade of Dominus will play out in the life of the aspirant. He or she will have completed all the tasks of the outer order, in any given tradition, and will be competent in controlling the physical-emotional-mental vehicles - not all the time, but the initiate's control will be tested by the initiatory process itself. A conflict will surely arise, quaintly symbolized for us by an Angel and a Shadow-Dweller. This is the personal battleground that one cannot avoid - the Kurukshetra War of the Mahabharata. A critical decision will be made, often involving both acceptance and renunciation. This will probably manifest as a series of decisions over a lengthy period of time. The goal of all the practices is to stop the mind. The fulcrum point is always \"zero\" if all of the opposites are balanced. This is symbolized in the Tibetan Level4 Star Empowerment. When the mind stops, even for a second, the result is that the \"soul star\" (of which the magical lamp is the outer symbol) will simply be there - and it will indicate a direction to be taken in order to resolve the manifested conflict. Since this pre-existing star was already there before the probationer even began the Path, there is no way to actively bring about its appearance - except, of course, by stopping the mind. This \"soul star,\" the herald of the Sun, is revealed in the first true dhyana, which is experienced in full consciousness without magickal potions, and it produces a self-reliant initiate who is free of personal compulsion and cultural programming. This is individualization, and it is individuation, and its philosophy is that of Existentialism, which maintains that the primary reference point of abstract thinking must be the individual and his or her direct experiences. Scientific thinking and moral thinking simply do not provide sufficient information in order to understand human existence.

There is distinct impression of being bathed in a whitish­golden light. That is, one is aware that this light is being radiated from one's body, and that this radiation can be enhanced by one's self. This is spoken to us in the words, enflame thyself in prayer. 4 4· Clairvoyantly, there is a visual sense of being on a cloud. 5. There is a sense of angels ... but there are no angels. 6.

It has a golden quality in everyone. We are all children of the Sun. To actually see the causal aura, one must be in causal consciousness; this might sometimes prove to be a little diffi cult. The presence of effects (as in the law of cause-and-effect, or karma) manifests as thoughtforms (symbols or images) in the causal aura, much like sunspots appear on the sun. These images cause a distortion in the initiate's perception of reality and dilute or block portions of the outflow of radiant energy. These images are problems. They can cause psychological disorders and medical conditions. Practitioners may often heal lesser problems, but at this (causal) level, no one else can disperse, resolve, or heal these imbedded thoughtforms - The initiate must resolve each problem for himself or herself. 5 This is the task of the inner order: To resolve each and every causal (karmic) stain that is embedded in the causal aura. Of course, this is impossible for the individual initiate. That is why the initiate must make contact with his or her Solar Angel (Holy Guardian Angel). The Solar Angel will then guide the initiate through the experiences (in life - not in the abstract realms) required to resolve the problems, and thus to balance their karma. Some people receive an \"imprint\" of the causal consciousness upon activating a proper \"trigger.\" Suitable triggers include meditation, sensory deprivation, free fall, zero gravity, religious rapture, energetic healing, acupuncture and cannabinoids. Specifically, the causal imprint has the ability to instantly override the imprints of all lower spheres. This gives us a key to salvation from the otherwise-impossible-to-change patterns imprinted on the various aspects of our personalities. The consciousness of causal imprinting is something we have in common with about twenty percent of humanity. The mechanism involves the blurring of the separation between body and mind, and the release of this separation leads to a sensation of ecstasy or euphoria. ' As counselors or practitioners, we may describe these problems, thus bringing a client to the understanding of what he or she must accomplish. but we cannot \"heal\" them: for it is strictly a matter between the client and his or her soul.

Tiphareth, the Sphere of the Sun, is the workplace of an Adept who is classified as being either without or within. If the Adept is without, then he or she is engaged in the preparation for, or the performance of, the central rite of western magick known as the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. If the Adept is within, then he or she has attained the goal of that central rite and a formal introduction to the Solar Angel has been made, and a dialog, a conversation, between the Adept and the Angel has commenced. This is comparable to entering the outer zones of the Sun (without), and then penetrating to the core (within). For those who prefer their definitions couched in religious or esoteric terminology, we see that the Adeptus (within) ... ls admitted to the practice of the formula of the Rosy Cross on entering the College of the Holy Ghost. ;; All these fancy descriptions and clever concepts are telling us that a man or a woman has established a direct contact with their \"soul,\" the core oftheir Sun.

The inner order of Adepts is comparable to the Inner Court, which is equivalent to the City of the Sun. The \"core\" of the Sun is the Sanctum Sanctorum. 6 If one were to look closely at the picture of the Temple, the Dominus Liminis can be seen standing in a white robe before the veil of the Inner Court. Passing Beyond the Veil ofParoketh THERE ARE TWO CONSIDERATIONS that must be taken into account when describing how the Dominus quits his or her stationary position that is Before the Veil and passes through to enter the Solar realm. On a personal level, the Dominus is one who, having been both a citizen of the world and an occult student, has reached the conclusion that, behind all the various causes that have been engaged, is a singular cause. This primal causal factor then becomes the singular goal of the search. In short, he or she decides to proceed with the invocation of the Solar Angel A Vajrayana Buddhist would begin the Yidam practice. iii It is significant that ancient Hebrew protocol allowed but one person to enter the Sanctum Sanctorum -the high priest. This reflects the fact that the Adeptus (within) is completely on his or own. a self-contained initiate. 13"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"In an external sense, this is the point where the Guru or the Grand Master releases the student from his or her direct guidance and instruction, telling the initiate, ''You have learned everything that I can teach you. Now you must go on by yourself in order to make your own direct, spiritual connection.\" Unfortunately, the Master is often not really a Master. That is, he or she is either unable to accurately judge levels of consciousness and see or sense when the student is ready for independent action, or they are motivated by emotional-material considerations and refuse to \"let go\" of the student. In either case, the Master really should not be playing the role of Master, but regardless of what \"should\" be, the game goes on. At best, he or she \"should\" be a first among equals, taking council from the other members of his or her peer group -even if it means resorting to that precarious process known as democracy. Regardless of what the actual circumstances might be, and they can include infinite possibilities, the Dominus is going to hit the road, either with or without parental consent. The Tibetan monastery system seems to handle these transitional matters rather efficiently. A monk may actually be able to perform these advanced, solitary practices in the company of his fellow lamas, without outside interference, or he may go out on retreat into the wilderness and then return to warming smiles. But in our western civilization, the candidate for adeptship often finds that he or she has to forego group membership and renounce obedience to the Master's word. Sometimes there is even an open conflict. A review of the historical records of most modern occult or esoteric societies seems to indicate that such a conflict is common and often the normal scenario. It is so common that one wonders if it might not be a prerequisite embedded within the western archetypal process of spiritual advancement. Indifferent to the external circumstances, there will be an internal conflict within the consciousness of the aspirant. The mind will be differentiating away from previous preconceptions and attachments. Nevertheless, he or she must pass on. 14"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Solitary Effort AFTER A PERIOD of adjustment into a full sense of self-reliance, the Dominus will begin to focus his or her concentration on the causal plane. He or she will enter the inner court of the City of the Sun. In a practical sense, this means the new Adeptus (without) will probably be sporadically experiencing episodes of dhyana (meditation) and externally locating and preparing a suitable Solar Temple. It might be within a grove of shady trees or a term of residence at a desert oasis. It may only be a single room in a rented house or it can be an entire palace. Some potentate may actually donate a fully consecrated Temple of the Sun, but one is advised to not hold their breath in pranayama while waiting for such a benefactor. One way to set all this in motion is to make an affirmation. This should not be confused with the practice of making affi rmations as prescribed by the New Age Movement, although that practice is not prohibited.

As a matter of convenience, it could be said, without regard for the presence or absence of external recognition or ceremonial initiation, that the creation of the Adeptus (without) is synchronous with stepping through the doorway or veil into the designated Solar Temple for the first time. 7 In the interest of full disclosure. it should be noted that some initiates attain the same result. but without the designation and consecration of a formal oratorium.

In our modern times, overshadowed by the Aeon of Horus, the magician is encouraged to design his or her own Ritual for the Invocation of the Solar Angel. All of the exercises and tasks of the outer order have been but preparation fo r this self-styled, central rite.

Abramelin gave Abraham manuscripts to copy. The text describes an elaborate ritual whose purpose is to obtain the knowledge and conversation of the magician's guardian angel. The preparations are elaborate, difficult, and long. All of the German texts describe a duration for the operation of eighteen months before any divine contact is known. In the Mathers translation, the initial phase of working the system lasts only six months.

The first way is purely mystical. That is, the entire operation is performed internally. by gradually withdrawing the indriyas (connections to the external world and to thoughts), and inwardly concentrating upon a point of light. There are no instruments, there is no temple. There may be a mantra instead of an invocation, and there may not be a mantra. This way is set fo rth fo r us in the teachings of Raja Yoga, and the other fo rms of Yoga are modifications of its principles. Regardless of the rigors and intricacies of any external rite, this internal mystical union is still going to take place, because the external procedures merely assist and support this internal goal. 23"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The second way is to undertake a ritual process, such as that of Abramelin or the grh Aethyr or the Yidam practice, exactly as written, or as directed by one's guru.

Brass may be substituted for gold, the lamp may bum peanut oil instead of olive oil, and the robe might be dark blue instead of white. This is perhaps the most common approach. The fo urth way is to fo rego all prototypes and design one • s own ceremony and scenario. Surely, there must also be a fifth way, composed of assorted elements fr om the basic fo ur ways. But regardless of the method, the goal remains the same. This goal is stated for us under the terms \"union,\" or \"'knowledge and conversation,\" or \"dialog with the light.\" All we really want to do is have a heart-to-heart chat with our higher nature, whatever it might be called. so that we might have some direction in our lives.

THE GENIUS THE SOUL BODY THE CLEAR LIGHT THE HIGHER SELF THE CAUSAL BODY THE SUPERIOR MAN THE HOLY GUARDIAN ANGEL THE NAME OF A SPECIFIC DEITY In this text, we shall continue to use the term, SOLAR ANGEL, or, THE ANGEL. because it is simple, specific and direct. The question often arises, \"Is the Angel an independent entity, or is it merely a personification of the soul?\" It is the author's viewpoint, based on experience, that the Solar Angel is a personification or manifestation of the archetypal process of initiation, but that it is more advantageous to assume that the Angel is a separate being simply because that is the way that it appears to the initiate. 24"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"This appearance is seen for what it really is when one has finally united with their higher nature and all images and concepts, such as angels and demons, completely disappear. It should also be appreciated that manifestations of our higher nature, in the form of guiding lights or guardian angels, are archetypal emissaries of that higher nature, beginning with the initial \"vision of the light\" at the first initiation, and following through the more intimate contact associated with the dialog that accompanies the \"lighting of the magickallamp\" at Paroketh. The \"higher nature\" to which we allude, is simply the next larger scope of consciousness in the holographic universe. It also helps to remember that the \"soul,\" or the \"higher self,\" is simply our own pre-existing state of consciousness that dwells in a realm prior to our physical manifestation. This is why the process of initiation is called the path of return. \"Show me your face before you were born,\" demands the Zen Master. Synchronized Existence TIPHARETH IS BEAUTIFUL. Its Qabalistic attribution is \"harmony and beauty.\" If the initiatory process is synchronized with the initiate's progress, external reality and internal consciousness will harmonize as one approaches the ceremony of the invocation of the Solar Angel. Mystics call this state the Beatific Vision.8 After the great conflict that was encountered at the Ve il of Paroketh, harmony slowly begins to prevail throughout personal associations, the workplace environment, and in consciousness. As one comes closer to that magical formula known as 5°=6°, human (5 - the microcosm) blends with the environment ( 6 -the macrocosm), and everything is just \"rosy.\" Actually, everything takes on a \"golden\" glow. 9 There are no health problems and one is literally floating or gliding through life.

All information, messages, thoughtforms and visions from higher realms are transmitted to human consciousness through the medium of this \"soul body.\" In many instances, the soul appears to the individual as if it were an angelic being and meaningful conversations take place; thus the title, \"Solar Angel.\" In other cases, the individual will merely enter into a harmonious and peaceful state, without visions and conversations taking place. We are told that the causal body is a collection of three permanent atoms, enclosed in an envelope of mental essence. Therefore, at the moment of individualization, which is the term used to express this hour of contact on the third subplane of the mental plane, there is a point of light, enclosing three atoms, and itself (the point of light) is enclosed in a sheath of mental matter. 27"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The work then proceeds by: (1) Inducing that point of light to grow into a flame, by steadily fa nning the spark and feeding the fire.

It will burn everything up and then ascend toward the spiritual triad, •o and as it becomes one with that triad, it will be re-absorbed, in stages, into the primordial consciousness. The work of the Personality (we must view everything from that perspective until Solar vision is ours) is first to build and expand the causal body; and second to absorb within it the personal life. Then, the flame is applied to the causal body itself, followed by the ecstatic, passive participation as the destruction proceeds. Eventually, the flame, the real inner being, is liberated, and it arises to its origin. (3) The actual contents of the causal body are the accumulated virtues of life, absorbed by a gradual process. This process builds casually at first, but towards the end the work proceeds rapidly on the Probationary Path and on the Path of Initiation. (4) At a subsequent stage, the causal body disappears completely and the initiate moves freely in the three lower worlds. The astral body and the causal or soul body are, in the esoteric language, supplementary to actual reality. They have a temporary reality during the evolutionary process, but they pass away and the initiate remains, holding power over fo rm with a fully awakened consciousness. 10 The spiritual triad is Atm a-Buddhi-Manas (Spirit-Intuition-Higher Mind), corresponding to Chokmah.

Did you just hear something go, \"click?\" 31"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Yes! The Adeptus Minor (without) has just become an Adeptus Minor (within). This is the fulcrum point wherein s0=6C begins to become 6°=5°. This switchover is played out in the life ofthe Adept when he or she leaves Tiphareth and passes to the Citadel of Mars, Geburah, along the path of Karma, called Adjustment, or Justice, or whatever else you want to call it. This \"click,\" this crisis event, this \"flip-over,\" point has been humorously referred to as 5-5°=5-5°. The 5·5 flip-over is the beginning of a new mode of operation. Instead of aspiration and seeking and trying so hard, the Adeptus must now turn to an approach that involves inspiration and receptivity, if the higher states are to be accessed. Talking to the Angel AT THE 5.5 POINT of burning light and cosmic changeover, the venturi is opened and the initiate will be able to know and converse with his or her Solar Angel. There are some considerations that should be understood about this scenario. 1. There is no Angel. Some people (or their marketing agents) have reported or implied that an Angel appeared unto them and that meaningful information was communicated. The Bible is filled with such accounts. Mohammed was said to have been visited by the archangel Gabriel. Joseph Smith received the location of certain golden plates from \"an angel,\" later identified (by others) as the angel Moroni. Abraham of Worms and his mentor, Abramelin the Mage, both implied that they were in communication with their Holy Guardian Angel. Frater Perdurabo said that he was contacted by Aiwass, who he described, on different occasions, as being composed of \"fine matter,\" and also as his Holy Guardian Angel, and also as a man (an Ip sissimus 10°=1° ), and further as a \"pyramid of light,\" and even further as a Devil-God once worshiped in Sumeria, which taken altogether is a rather wide spectrum of definition. Perdurabo also tells us that magick is something we subjectively experience, but that it is more convenient to presume the external reality of an angel as opposed to some superhuman power. 32"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"INSERT If the reader is unfamiliar with the strange equations, such as S0=6i J, it should be noted that 5° indicates the fifth degree or grade, counting from the bottom up, and 6!J refers to the sephira (singular, \"sphere\"), counting from the top down. The greater the difference between the two numbers, the more diffi cult the task of the grade is said to be. Thus 5°=6° and 6°=5° are the easiest, while 10°=1° and 10°=1° are theoretically the hardest, when attempting to harmonize or equilibrate the diffe rence between the two numbers. 33"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"A similar scenario is presented by people who claim to have been contacted by \"Ascended Masters,\" or Mahatmas, who are high-level initiates that have been \"liberated\" or have otherwise \"passed on.\" Such beings are theoretically still with us, dwelling in etheric-physical matter, but they are able to manifest in the dense physical world through a mayavirupa (illusionary body). We need look no farther back than the biblical legend of (doubting) Thomas, who was confronted by the Master Jesus in a dense physical body, after his physical crucifixion and death. In more recent times, Madam Blavatsky, Alice Bailey and Muriel Isis Dorner, all claim to have been visited by the Masters Morya, Koot Hoomi and/or Dj whal Khul, in dense physical bodies. Doctor Carl Jung reviewed the works of Alice Bailey and stated that they were truly remarkable, but that the Tibetan Master, Dj whal Khul, was a projection from her higher self. 13 Soror Artemis, a contemporary physician and magician who is endowed with the \"spirit vision,\" has often been in the presence of people who were dying. On more than one occasion, she perceived the presence of an angel, but she is also quick to acknowledge that these were thoughtforms, or visions, that were being generated by the dying person. 2. But there is something. Irrespective of the descriptions of Angels or Mahatmas, there surely is something that is invoked or otherwise puts in an appearance, and meaningful information is imparted. The most basic archetypal symbol encountered in these matters is that of a Star or a Sun (which, after all, is itself a Star). 3. And there is a conversation Oh yes. Whether an Angel is seen or felt, or only a Star is perceived, the successful initiate will engage the subjective archetype in a perfectly normal two-way discussion. Of course, one must be discrete when speaking of such matters, for people who \"hear voices\" are subject to assorted medical diagnoses, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression and drug abuse. 13 To which Alice Bailey commented, •'Perhaps Dr. Jung can explain how my higher self sends me packets of incense fr om India.\" 34"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Tibetan Book of the Dead gives us a wonderful description of such a conversation when the dying person, or the initiate, is in that state known as The Secondary Clear Light: On this secondary level of the First Bardo, a meaningful dialo..<J takes place between the Clear Light along with the appreciation that this ecstatic perception is occurring to oneself ... This secondary experience involves a certain state of conceptual lucidity. This dialog has been called The knowledge and conversation of the Holy Gu.1rdian Angel. lt can take many forms. In this second stage of the First Bardo, both the mystical non-self and the mystical self are experienced - simultaneously. vii 4· There is no ongoing, constant, daily conversation. Let's not get the idea that once this contact with the Solar Angel is made (knowledge), and a dialog ensues (conversation), that some entity will be following the Adept around, whispering guidance in his or her (mental) ear. If there can be such a thing described as \"the normal procedure,\" it would be that there is an initial contact made (at the Veil of Paroketh), perhaps followed some time later with additional contacts. 14 The central conversation eventually takes place at Tiphareth and it can be rather lengthy and profound. After that, the dialogs tend to be sporadic as the Adept returns to a commonplace life in the three worlds. One is always trying to get the inner message - sometimes it's clear as a bell, yet often it's dark as a coal mine. And more than this it is not necessary to say1 for his Angel shall have entreated him kindly, and showed him in what manner he may be most perfectly invoked. And unto him that has this Master, there is nothing else that he needs, so long as he continue in the knowledge and conversation of the Angel, so that he shall come at last into the City of the Pyramids. - Sch Aethyr viii 14 It is written that Mohammed had an initial conversation with Gabriel, and then three years passed before the angel reappeared to begin dictating the Koran. 35"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"9£"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Destruction of the Temple But if you do not intend to use them any more, not even the oratory, you shall bum them all, and bury the ashes in a secret place. -Abramelin THE ANNIHILATION or retirement of the Instruments takes place at some stage during or after the operation in the City of the Sun. There is no rule or specified instruction involved, and such a rash procedure is barely mentioned in the esoteric literature. The Adept will know when the time has come. Frater Shiva was surprised when, during the ceremony described in the 8th Aethyr, his first instruction was to absorb the essence of each instrument into his being, one at a time, and then to remove that instrument from the magick circle. In The Book of Life (and Death) it was said to him: The symbolic material signs must be transformed into Spirit. Do this: Transfigure these things into yourself.

A L� there � � <:lc?�rc?r Light A Book from the Sun ©1994 by Sirius Star System © Now THE TIME has come for you to perform that Great Experiment known as the Invocation of the Solar Angel. Herein you may use all or part of each and every magickal or mystical art you have mastered. There is no rule, procedure or direct guidance from your teacher, guru or link in this matter, yet general guidelines appear in the literature for your review and benefit. Having found such published guidelines to be excessively demanding and overly intricate, I herewith set fo rth my own observations, experiences, and suggestions for your use, but even as I do, I call your attention to the fact that you have passed into a sphere where your operational directions must come from within. An Introduction THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES, VariOUS cultures and societies have presented concepts relating to direct soul-contact. The soul has been given many names, including those we know as the Solar Angel and the Holy Guardian Angel. Many persons call this Angel by the term \"higher self,\" and from a certain perspective this is true, for the Angel represents a \"higher\" aspect of our \"lower,\" three-dimensional self."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"From the initiatory viewpoint, the higher self is that part of us which resides beyond the great abyss. It has been called the Supernal Triad. From an even higher perspective, the higher self is the Monad at Kether, the Star-essence of our being from which the Triad comes forth. Correlation to the upper three spheres of the Tree of Life is implied, and it is this Triad that projects a part of itself into matter. Descending level by level, our higher self set a guardian at each rung of the consciousness ladder and empowered that sentry with a secret word. When we come climbing back up, the guard at each level will let us pass only when we can reproduce the original word. Of course, if we sonnd the word, then we become the guardian (again) and re-enter the realm from whence we came (well, at least one of them). But as to the nature and location of the soul. Is it a higher aspect of our persona? Or is it an independent, angelic being? Perhaps it is merely one of the guardians mentioned above? When our original descent toward matter reached the midway point, we established a reference point at the sphere of the Sun upon the higher mental plane. This is the causal body, the soul body -an energetic field that is said to be maintained by an independent devic entity whose function is solely to \"Guide and Protect.\" Thus the title, Holy Guardian Angel. From this causal realm our soul body sends forth a projection of itself into matter, and we are incarnated. We then live a lifetime, essentially separated in consciousness from Angels and Monads. Upon the demise of the physical body, the sum-total of the life-time experience is absorbed back into the soul. Somewhere in this cycle of life and death, the soul comes to the point where it has absorbed enough experience to sound the Call to Return and we come to dimly remember something about the nature of the soul. Then we set out to consciously re-unite with it. Thus begins the process of initiation. The search for the soul winds through the temples of many false gods. Yet, piece by piece, we build a true temple. We receive instruction from teachers and associate with other soul-seekers. We polish and refine our outer vehicle so that it will become capable of re-union. 50"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"This refinement is the work of what we call the Outer Order, and when it is complete we are ready to perform The Great Work, which is defined as the attainment of the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The Great Work is the invocation of the Solar Angel. The Great Work is the harmonization of above and below, of inner and outer, of personality and soul. Review of the Literature There is an abundance of text available that deals with spiritual matters, but only a few selections bear directly on this issue of Solar invocation. Philosophy and theory have their place, but what we want is the direct line, the how-to-do-it material. In your training in the outer order, surely you heard tales and read biographical material relative to the Solar Angel operation. Stories of the Saints have given you an overview of the art. Now comes the hour of opening the final books, for with the exception of two additional books, your reading is almost complete. These two additional books are (1) Your own Solar operation, and (2) The message your Angel will deliver unto you. The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage is the classical western text of the Holy Guardian Angel operation. Its lengthy and detailed instructions have proven to be overly complex in the light of current information, yet the review of this book is appropriate for an understanding of the ancient method of attainment upon which our relatively more-efficient, contemporary rites are based. The Vision and the Vo ice, specifically the 8th Aethyr, gives instruction for invoking the Angel. Similar in style to Abramelin 's system, this method requires less time. In The Rays and the Initiations, as well as other texts by The Tibetan, you will find several excellent discourses on the nature and invocation of the Solar Angel. I highly recommend them for your study, for they provide insight and balance that might be lacking if you solely pursue Abramelin or the 8th Aethyr. It has also been said that one should have received admission to the Inner Order on the physical plane through a representative of an ancient and viable lineage before one commences this operation. This makes sense, but I cannot say if it is absolutely necessary. 51"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Essence of the Art EACH TEXT AND INSTRUCTION of this sacred art varies somewhat from its companions, yet there are common elements - the study of which will benefit us all in getting to the Heart of the matter: First, there is a period of Preliminary Training. Whether this is yoga, meditation, mental discipline, or some other science, the point is that one is capable of following through with the invocation of the Angel only when sufficient capacity for prolonged concentration has been developed. Next comes the Selection of the Temple. The various texts describe small cottages and/ or special rooms complete with windows in specified directions or in the roof. The details matter less than the fa ct that one obtains a house or room which is used solely for this Art. The Labor of Preparation involves the cleaning, painting, and arrangement of the Temple and its purification (banishing), as well as the gathering of instruments, garments, furniture, and other items to be used in the rite. A blank book or magickal record is to be included. An attentive magician will ensure that each item is purified by water and consecrated by fire before it is placed in the Temple. Regardless of the style of the Temple, once it is prepared no other person should be allowed to enter - although a menial is sometimes permitted to enter in order to clean it. An Oath to commence and complete this invocation is written out and perhaps placed in the magickal record, and when the operation commences, this Oath is uttered and signed. Guided by meditation, An Invocation of the Solar Angel is written. Eventually one begins The Ongoing Rite which typically includes performing the invocation a few times each day, increasing to the point where it is virtually continual. The secret is to Invoke Oft en. The operation continues, for six months, or ninety-one days, or some other time-based figure, until the day of The Final Rite arrives. On this day, it is promised by the various authors that the Angel will appear and the magician should write down the ensuing conversation. 52"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Variations of the Rite VARious EXPERTs set forth different styles of temple, procedures, and time factors. So we must conclude that the specifics are not as important as the overall outline, and each magician must design his or her own Ritual. Observations HAVING SET THIS ALL DOWN, J must now be forthright and declare that these methods that have been described are demonstrations of the so-called patriarchal system. That is, they are authored by men. Nowhere in the literature does a woman seem to stand forth and proclaim that she has accomplished the Art as described by Abramelin or through the directions of the 8th Aethyr. 1 In fact, I have never known, nor know of, any woman who has contacted her Solar Angel by extended ceremonial activity. This does not mean (from my viewpoint) that women do not contact their Angel, but they appear to do it through means other than ceremonial retirement. So now, if you are a woman who has set your sights on feminine adeptship, you certainly may do it in the ancient, male­oriented way. If you succeed or have succeeded in this manner, or even in some other way, I stand ready to listen to your tale. When it comes time to verify your results, there are certain ways to determine if you are fooling yourself. When one experiences a true and permanent contact with higher forces, there is a reluctance to speak about it for some time. Those who have an insight, and then rush about proclaiming \"the truth\" in a fanatical manner, have merely had their ego inflated or have been knocked off balance. A contact made by a balanced personality is so overwhelming to the ego that it takes a long time to assimilate the energy and import of the event, and one's expression regarding the matter is held in Silence until the Light can be absorbed in a balanced manner by the lower self, and radiated without egoic influence to the world. AbrameHn very clearly states that ·'We should not admit women into this Operation:' 53"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"I also caution you to not speak of your operation during its preparation or during its enactment. You do not need to waste any of your focused energy explaining your acts to anyone; and you certainly do not need anyone else's thoughtforms directed toward your efforts. In addition, no-one should be permitted to enter your Temple; this is for the protection of your Art as well as for their protection. We have heard of bystanders being blasted by the accumulated voltage, and in my rite, this truly occurred. In my absence, a lady entered my Temple to observe, and when I met her seven hours after her brief \"peek,\" she was almost mindless and totally obsessed. Over and over, she repeated similar phrases such as, \"That room! There was nothing in it, nothing special, but ... Oh! That room!\" Now I have said that which must be said.

To be shut off in all areas but the music of the spheres. Harmonize with the soul-note and be at peace. This is also The Book of Death. Every initiation is the death of that which went before, and the beginning of life on a new plane. Every initiation means greater freedom. Therefore, death is freedom. Initiation is death, and therefore they40 fear the number 9. 41 But at the Heart of every Initiation, which is the point of death (or total detachment), is a golden Fire.
