Along-standing interest in the English and French literature of the eighteenthcentury led me to its chief subjects. The reading of any work of literaturebecomes richer and more intelligible when conducted against the background ofthe intellectual climate in which it was created, but for the period of theEnlightenment the historical “background” is often indispensable. First inpreparing to write the book and then again while actually writing it, I spentseveral years pursuing such apparently disparate topics as alchemy, epistolaryculture, Renaissance Egyptology, Jansenism, Pietism, the spread of Freemasonryin France, and the rise and decline of the literary salon. I say “apparently”disparate because one at length discovers in the period of the Enlightenment, asof course in other historical periods, some convincing overarching unities.This book, though necessarily founded in a wide reading of scholarly literatureover many years, is intended for the educated general reader rather than thespecialist. Accordingly, I do not supply the footnote citations and extensivebibliography appropriate for the genre of the academic monograph. However, Ihave appended to each chapter a brief bibliography. It gives the details ofworks on which I have chiefly relied and identifies most from which I haveactually quoted. Some of the sources appear in specialized journals found onlyin research libraries. In the hopes that The Dark Side may stimulate thereader’s interest in this or that aspect of its materials, I also offer somegeneral suggestions for possible further reading. I have tried whenever possibleto direct the reader to materials written in the English language or availablein English translation. I have also tried to exercise an option for thereadable. Inevitably the best sources on European topics and persons aresometimes written in European languages, and I cite such foreign-languagescholarship as has significantly shaped my book.With a few rare exceptions, such as perhaps St. John the Divine on the isle ofPatmos, authors rarely really write books on their own. Certainly I could neverhave written this one without the help of many family members, friends,colleagues, and professional collaborators in the publishing business. I want toacknowledge some of them by name here:Most of the preparation of this book was done in the Firestone Library ofPrinceton University, but I also enjoyed the facilities of the American Libraryin Paris. My first debt of gratitude, as always, is to the librarians who workso effectively to preserve and make accessible the materials of humanisticstudy. Without the stimulating conversations of many professional friends andcolleagues over the decades I would never have undertaken the project.Stimulation in genesis is not the same thing as approbation in result, and mysincere gratitude for the former comes entirely without any spurious claim ofthe latter. My family, typified by the young scholars to whom I have dedicatedthe book, have tolerated my foibles and indulged my enthusiasms for a long time,in some instances for more than half a century. I am aware of my great goodfortune.I have been fortunate, too, in the professionals I have worked with in thepublishing world. The cheerful optimism of my delightful literary agent, JuliaLord, is an unfailing tonic. At W. W. Norton I enjoyed once again the experthelp of Starling Lawrence, this time aided by his young associate RyanHarrington. If I think of them as the Batman and Robin of New York literaryeditors, Ann Adelman, my copy editor, is beyond question the Wonder Woman. Mywife Joan and my friend Eli Schwartz shared with me the inglorious labors ofproofreading. Thank you."},{"pageContent":"Introduction:The Light and the Dark [../Text/content.xhtml#intro]T HE DARK SIDE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT is a work of cultural and literary history.Its subjects include certain historical phenomena of the Enlightenment period(the awkward persistence of miracles, learned occultism, Rosicrucianism andFreemasonry, among them) and certain personages (Cagliostro and Julie deKrüdener most prominently) presenting challenges to the generally held views ofwhat the Enlightenment was, and what it did. My book does not pretend to presenta sequential argument, let alone a new definition of Enlightenment or a freshinterpretation of it. It does, however, argue for a more capacious examinationof what was “enlightened.”One of the first things that strikes the interested reader who approaches thelarge literature of eighteenth-century intellectual history is that the veryterm “Enlightenment” as used by scholars is elastic if not protean. Thus we havepolitical Enlightenment, radical Enlightenment, classical Enlightenment,scientific Enlightenment, and many more. We have local Enlightenments galore:the Scottish, the French, the Baltic, and the Bavarian. They are joined byCounter-Enlightenment, an anti-Enlightenment, enemies of Enlightenment.It is not going too far to say that many scholarly definitions of theEnlightenment have been designed in part to exclude important phenomenauncongenial to the definer. Thus historians of the Age of Reason have oftentaken a more restrictive definition of “reason” than did the thinkers andwriters of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Henry Stubbe was, in hisview, a scientist. His defense of the “miracles” wrought by Valentine Greatrakeswas based in a rational and scientific mentality, though one of a different sortthan that exhibited by some of his antagonists in the Royal Society. It waslikewise an increasingly augmented and “enlightened” confidence in the power andpotential of “natural philosophy” that encouraged the “natural” magicians andthe alchemists—alchemy being, indeed, the Queen of Enlightenment Science.Each of the chapters of this book deals with topics or personages enabled anddefined by the Enlightenment context. Sorcerers had existed since the time ofthe Bible and before. But a sorcerer like Count Cagliostro was made possibleonly by an essentially new social context, the features of which includedextensive and rapid international communication of ideas in a functioning“Republic of Letters,” and a self-conscious and well-organized internationalintellectual elite of Rosicrucians and Freemasons. There seems to me no goodreason to divorce from the Enlightenment the focus on personal emotion andartistic sentiment of a Julie de Krüdener. Romanticism was not always therejection of Enlightenment, but often—at least in the minds of the“Romantics”—its expansion and refinement. The origins of Romanticism areintimately connected with hermetic and occult traditions nurtured by anEnlightenment elite.I CHOSE THE TITLE The Dark Side of the Enlightenment, which is meant to begood-humored as well as lighthearted, for probably obvious reasons. It seemsrather catchy. It plays against the flattering idea of intellectual andspiritual illumination that gave birth to the word “Enlightenment,” as well asits principal European equivalents, the French Lumières and the GermanAufklärung. Since the period of the Enlightenment witnessed, among other things,a remarkable efflorescence of occultism and mysticism, and since such topicsoccupy much of my attention, the title seemed to me not merely appropriate butinevitable. Only when I was well into my researches did I come across a Germanbook (Thomas Freller’s Cagliostro: Die dunkle Seite der Aufklärung, 2001) thatanticipates it in its subtitle.The author of an odd book about odd people perhaps owes his readers anexplanation. Of old the troubadours sometimes called their art the “gay saber,”the “happy” science or knowledge. “Saber” is a Romance derivative of the Latinsapere, “to know”; and the poets meant by “happy” knowing or science, I believe,that form of intellectual activity that was delightful both in its practice andin its product. Thomas Carlyle perhaps had this phrase in mind when he coinedthe derisive term “the dismal science” to denote the discipline of economics, orpolitical economy, ever rising in prestige in Victorian England.Carlyle was hardly the first to note or deplore the progress of the dismalscience in its broadest sense. Edmund Burke, perhaps less appalled by thedecapitation of Queen Marie-Antoinette than by the social changes that couldmake it seem for thinking men an acceptable or tolerable act, let alone a justor virtuous one, saw in it the end of an era. “But the age of chivalry is gone,”he famously wrote in his Reflections on the French Revolution. “That ofsophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europeis extinguished forever.” Was the change lamented by Burke indeed so dramaticand ominous as he thought?The province of humanistic “knowing” is a mixed terrain. It has its dark valleysas well as its bright, shining peaks, not to mention its vast stretches that areflatter than Flanders and drier than the Gobi Desert. But it is the troubadours’concept of saber that has defined my own ambition in The Dark Side of theEnlightenment. The first half of their concept (pleasure in the practice ofsaber) I can fairly claim to have achieved.I am a professional medievalist, and specifically one who has pursued a careerinvestigating various aspects of the Christian thought, literature, andpictorial art of Europe in the long period between Augustine and Erasmus. Thebook I now present deals with very different materials from a very differenthistorical period—namely, the period usually called the European Enlightenment,and usually dated, approximately, between about 1650 and, say, 1815, with mostof its principal salient achievements falling within the eighteenth century.(The precise span of my own study runs from 1662, when an Irish squire awokewith the “impulse” that he had the power to cure scrofula, to the dateuncertain, but early in the post-Napoleonic period, when Julie de Krüdenerdisappeared in the Crimea. One iconic emblem of the Enlightenment was the greatFrench Encyclopédie, which appeared over the course of the third quarter of theeighteenth century. Scholarly experts in this field are forever tinkering withdates. Harold Nicolson is probably right in his elegant study The Age of Reasonin saying that it would be unwise to seek some spurious chronological precision,though he himself points to two great intellectual landmarks that might suggesta beginning.These are Isaac Newton’s Principia (1687) and John Locke’s Essay ConcerningHuman Understanding (1690). In very general terms these enormously influentialbooks mark a decisive shift in the way thinkers regarded the natural worldaround them, and the way they thought about thinking itself. What they proposedbetween them was no small innovation. It would after all be difficult to find asphere larger than that of the human mind and all possible objects of itsattention. I came up with the pseudo-terminal date of 1815, the year ofWaterloo, myself. I am not alone in regarding Napoleon Bonaparte as at the veryleast an implication of Enlightenment. Among the most famous and ghoulish of theetchings in Goya’s Los caprichos is the one entitled El sueño de la razónproduce monstruos. This is usually translated The Sleep of Reason BreedsMonsters. So also and in another sense, as I hope to suggest in this book, didthe Dream of Reason.In truth I have been drawn to my project by both positive and negative stimuli,in part by inclination and in part by provocation. Under the heading of“inclination” I would list, in addition to the nearly inexhaustible riches ofeighteenth-century literature and the attractive monuments of eighteenth-centurythought, a distinct element of patriotism. Really, all Americans ought to beinterested in the Enlightenment as our nation is Enlightenment’s child—a thoughtthat should lead us to view the parental abuse of our quotidian political lifewith an augmented sense of irony or embarrassment. In addition to this I have amore local and personal reason. I spent my long career teaching at PrincetonUniversity. Most of our oldest academies were founded at least in part onEnlightenment concepts, but Princeton, as a monument to the Presbyterian Reformin the eighteenth century, had particular connections with that most interestingseat of Enlightenment in the Anglophone world: Scotland. Two Scottish-AmericanPrinceton presidents, John Witherspoon (1723–1794) and James McCosh (1811–1894),were in differing ways living emblems of the Enlightenment. Witherspoon, alearned clergyman, was the only signer of the Declaration of Independence whowas a college professor. James McCosh continued on to the very threshold of thetwentieth century the Enlightenment’s conception of “moral philosophy.”As for the provocation, it is related to my vocation of Medieval Studies. Earlyin my career as a medievalist I became aware of and annoyed by a certainhistorical “narrative,” of nearly ubiquitous credit among the semi-educated,that might be called Gibbon’s canard. The reference, of course, is to the greatEnglish historian Edward Gibbon, author of The Decline and Fall of the RomanEmpire. It goes roughly like this. There was once a great Western Civilizationin which people walked around in their bathrobes writing epic poems, buildingParthenons and Coliseums and civilizing known worlds by imperial domination.That beautiful world came to an end when a cultural disaster (Christianity) andsomething called the Vökerwanderung (barbarian hordes running hither andthither) joined forces to create the Middle Ages, aka the Dark Ages, a bleakmillennium of brutality, disease, ignorance, and superstition. Things began toget a little better eventually when one day in the fourteenth century Petrarchwalked into a cave, found a pile of long-neglected manuscripts, and decided tostart a Renaissance. But they only got good again when toward the end of theseventeenth century Newton published the Principia and only really good in theeighteenth century when Jean-Jacques Rousseau arrived on the scene and taughthis friends and relations (many of whom in Rousseau’s case were his abandonedbastard children) how to have a New Sensibility.But this is to subject to travesty an author who subjected the European MiddleAges to nothing stronger than caricature, perhaps. Unfortunately, theGibbonesque view of the matter has become permanent in our lexicon. In 1984, atthe annual meeting of the Medieval Academy of America in Atlanta, Professor FredRobinson of Yale, who was in that year the president of the academy, deliveredthe annual presidential address on the topic “Medieval, the Middle Ages,”italicizing the words in such a fashion as to make clear that his business wasto be with “the terms medieval and Middle Ages, not with the period itself.”Fred Robinson is a learned philologist, but also a very witty fellow, and histalk had a sparkle not always to be associated with the phrase “presidentialaddress.”He surveyed a wide sampling of occurrences of the adjective “medieval” in ourcontemporary discourse. Using the Computational Analysis of Present-Day Englishof Kucera and Francis, one of the early gifts of computer technology tohumanistic study, Robinson was able to confirm that the adjective “medieval” asused in contemporary English refers to the actual Middle Ages only infrequently.Medieval “is most often used in Modern English simply as a vague pejorative termmeaning ‘outmoded,’ ‘hopelessly antiquated,’ or even simply ‘bad.’”A typical anecdote had to do with the meaning of the word as imagined by NBCNightly News. In 1983 the Dutch beer baron, Freddy Heineken, along with hisdriver, was kidnapped and held for ransom by a gang of desperadoes. During thetime the kidnappers were successfully negotiating a huge tribute, the victimswere held prisoner, unharmed, in a cement-block room. They were fed, amply butmonotonously, with Chinese take-out packaged in Styrofoam. This treatment,according to Tom Brokaw, was “medieval.” Fast-food restaurants are a culturalfeature of modernity, and General Tso’s Chicken is a delicacy unknown even tosuch ancient baronial sybarites as are imagined to have feasted on larks’tongues.WHEREAS THE NAMES OF other historical periods have been invented by theirfriends, the poor medieval period has been left, onomastically speaking, nakedbefore its enemies. The Middle Ages, obviously, must be medial, in the middle ofsomething. What they were medial between, of course, was on one side “the glorythat was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome” and on the other side “theRenaissance,” the period in which the glory that was Greece and the grandeurthat was Rome became “born again.” The Middle Ages are perhaps theeighteen-and-a-half-minute gap in the cultural tape of Western culture. This istoo widespread and common a notion to be attributed to a single “source.” Gibbonsimply gave particularly forceful and witty expression to attitudes endemic tothe Enlightenment.Think for a moment of the terminology historians use to denote other remoteobjects of their interests and attention. “Antiquity,” for instance, has a nicepositive ring about it, even when it is not yet further dignified as “ClassicalAntiquity.” Needless to say, the “Classical Period” itself has an even nicerring to it, as do its more localized subdivisions, such as the “Greco-Roman” andthe “Hellenistic.” One might suppose that historians would be kinder tosubmissive and cooperative vassals than those rebellious and unyielding, butsuch is not the case. Even “prehistory,” a term used by historians to denotethose vast eons forever lost to their ministrations in the thick fogs of theirpre-alphabetic remoteness, is at least a neutral term. Think for a moment of theorigins of the English word “Gothic.” Better yet, try the following experiment.Go onto the eBay Web site and search for items under the heading “Gothic.” Youwill find lots of very interesting stuff, but not many postcards of theSainte-Chapelle.Renaissance is a French word meaning “rebirth.” As a term of historicalperiodization, it complements itself at the expense of what it has replaced,namely, the Middle Ages. The Middle Ages are indeed medial precisely in terms ofthe European “classical” period in its first and second iterations, are-emergence after long, dull hibernation of highly desirable cultural habitsand achievements. Of course, if you have spent a lifetime with such shadows ofthat dark night as the subtle mind of Augustine or the magnificent Latin of Johnof Salisbury or the poetic genius of Dante Alighieri, you are more likely toview the matter in terms of continuities and modulations of emphasis rather thanintellectual revolution, root and branch.There were some Renaissance figures who self-consciously enjoyed a sense ofsuperiority with regard to the centuries immediately earlier. There waswidespread revulsion at the sterilities of the Scholastic method. Our Englishword “dunce” derives from the personal name of one of the most subtle of theScholastic doctors, John Duns Scotus. But the anti-Scholastic attitude longantedated Scholasticism’s decay. There is a beautiful passage in Rabelais (2.8)in which Gargantua, writing to his son Pantagruel away at college, exults inadvances in culture since the day of his own father Grangousier, who lived whenthe “time was still dark, and smacking of the infelicity and calamity of theGoths, who had brought all good literature to destruction.” But it was reallythe thinkers and writers of the Enlightenment who dogmatized the historicalconcept of the “Dark Ages”; it was in response to their goading that, many yearsago, I began to collect the materials that would eventually become the subjectmatter of this book. I did this in a casual and amateur way, around the edges ofmy general interest reading. I soon discovered that a scholar seeking to study“medieval” witchcraft or “medieval” alchemy would find but comparatively slimpickings before the centuries of Renaissance and Enlightenment. There issomething droll in this perception, and in exploring it I have allowed myself tobe guided by an assumption that has informed my entire scholarly life. It isthis: although cultural history is a serious business, cultural historians dowell to try to honor in their own work those elements of the lighthearted, theabsurd, the comic, and the ironic that are a part of the lived experience ofeven the grimmest of historical periods.The medieval theme is serious in this book to the following extent. There arenumerous aspects of the intellectual life of the Enlightenment in which themedieval continuities are as conspicuous as the medieval rejections. Themachinery of medieval Christianity was easier to jettison than the appetite fortranscendental experience, and long traditions of medieval religious practiceseemed to offer natural conduits to it.Although everybody knows what the Enlightenment was (is) in a very generalsense, the consensus crumbles with every step toward specificity. Immanuel Kantwas one of the greatest of Enlightenment philosophers, perhaps the greatest. Hewrote a famous essay entitled “What is Enlightenment?” He certainly ought toknow, if anybody knows, and we must in a moment consider his noble answer to thequestion he put to himself. Suffice it for the moment to say that Kant’s answerdoes little to delimit our conception of the chronological period of theEnlightenment, its principal intellectual characteristics, or the subject matterof its characteristic preoccupations.The general meaning of “Enlightenment” is perhaps self-evident. In one standardreference work, Chisick’s Historical Dictionary of the Enlightenment, we findthe following definition: “the process of spreading certain kinds ofinformation, knowledge, understanding and attitudes.” The editor adds thefollowing gloss: “The name of the movement is its own key metaphor: lightspreading and driving out the darknesses of ignorance, superstition andfanaticism.” The enlightened is the obverse of the benighted, as day is theobverse of night. But of course images of enlightenment in this sense will befound in all the major religions and secular philosophies of the world. Perhapsthe most famous Christian convert of the post-biblical period was St. Augustine,just as Paul was the most famous convert of the biblical period. It wasthematically appropriate, therefore, that Augustine’s moment of conversionshould come through a fortuitous reading of a passage in Paul in which theApostle admonishes his hearers to move from metaphoric night to metaphoric day,to put off the works of darkness and to don the armor of light. “The night isfar spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness,and let us put on the armour of light.” That text became, and remains to thisday, an appointed reading for the first Sunday in Advent, at the very beginningof each new year of the Christian calendar.In this book there will inevitably—and at least superficially, surprisingly—benumerous references to the Bible. Whatever their preconceptions, candid studentsof the European Enlightenment must soon discover that it had a great deal to dowith religion. Indeed, I am tempted to write that it was all aboutreligion—salvaging it in some way, or finding a suitable replacement. “Natureand Nature’s laws lay hid in night,” wrote the English poet Alexander Pope inthe early eighteenth century; “God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.” Thatis an obvious and for its time rather daring play on the cosmogony in the firstchapter of the Book of Genesis. “God said, ‘Let there be light!’ and there waslight.” Pope himself was a lifelong Roman Catholic sufficiently steadfast in hispaternal religion to absorb the considerable personal indignities and socialdisadvantages of Anglican prejudice for a lifetime. Sir Isaac Newton, whom heinserted into the text of Holy Writ, was a religious enthusiast who almostcertainly regarded his investigations into the prophetical meaning of the Bookof Daniel as of equal importance to his articulation of the law of gravity. Theyare both “Enlightenment figures,” and even in certain respects “typical” ones.Many philosophers and writers have sought to give a more precise or pointeddefinition of Enlightenment. I have already mentioned one of the earliest andmost famous: the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. In 1784, Kant wrote an essayentitled “Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?” It is a brilliantessay, studded with perceptions and suggestions of permanent value. For Kant,Enlightenment was a liberation from a self-imposed or at least toleratedchildishness.“Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturityis the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another. Thisimmaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, butin lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapereaude! ‘Have courage to use your own understanding!’—that is the motto ofenlightenment.” The more literal translation of Kant’s Latin motto Sapere audeis “Dare to know.” Kant, that is, proclaimed the audacity of knowledge.Kant believed in a universalized human capacity of independent reason. The greatimpediment to human progress (which Kant imagined principally in ethical terms)was not incapacity but mental timidity or cowardice, the fear of independentthinking and fear’s vicious sibling, the comfortable habit of settling forsecondhand authority. There can be no doubt that one of the principalachievements of the European Enlightenment was to encourage thinking aboutthings in radically new ways, and in seeking knowledge that for long centurieshad been judged by the arbiters of the sacred and secular realms alike as atbest unattainable if not forbidden. The overthrow of the great edifice ofmedieval thought was inevitable.Yet the view of many, perhaps even most, students of the European Enlightenmentis that Enlightenment has failed us, or at least remains radically imperfect. Itcertainly failed to inoculate us against the two great cultural pathologies ofthe twentieth century, Bolshevism and Nazism. In 1944, two eminent Germanphilosophers who had the most poignant reasons to deplore the latter, MaxHorkheimer and Theodor Adorno, published their Dialectic of Enlightenment. Thisis a very famous book, far more famous than comprehensible, in my opinion. It ismore theoretical and speculative than historical and analytical. It is notprecisely a critique of the historical period of the Enlightenment, but of acertain concept of Enlightenment. One line of its argument that for meapproaches clarity posits the collapse of Enlightenment rationality into “myth”of the sort that rationality was meant to replace. A more global claim is that“the program of the Enlightenment was the disenchantment of the world.”I myself would never want to seem to speak against enlightenment, with orwithout its capital letter. Better than most, perhaps, a medievalist might knowwith concrete specificity the meaning for the progress of human felicity of thepolitical, material, and medical advances associated with the Enlightenment andthe ideas and attitudes to which it gave birth. But I perhaps am inclined toview the matter in a rather different light.How could rationality unadorned possibly compensate for the loss of the mythicworld? It seems to me that to understand the “problem” of Enlightenmentrationality we need search no further than the opening sentence of the mostfamous of books by the most famous of Enlightenment philosophers—the Critique ofPure Reason, by Immanuel Kant (1781, rev. 1787). “Human reason,” Kant wrote,“has this peculiar fate, that in one species of its knowledge it is burdened byquestions which, as prescribed by the very nature of reason itself, it is notable to ignore, but which, as transcending all its powers, it is also not ableto answer.”Surely no human heart can be deaf to what Kant is saying here. He is talkingabout the mystery of life: the God question, the soul question, the questions ofthe origin of the earth and the origin of species, man among the animals, thetruth or the illusion of the freedom of the will, the conundrums of time andspace. Reason cannot ignore these questions, yet it cannot answer them either.The implication is that if such questions were to be answered, it would requiresomething more than reason to answer them. The old world had found thatsomething more in “revelation.” In the period of the Enlightenment, revelationbecame a highly contested category. There were many who, though they could notaccept in their usual and conventional form the usual and conventional claims,were unable to dispense altogether with “transcendence.” This book is about someof those people.One of the fouler libels smearing the Middle Ages is that it was “irrational.”On the contrary, medieval thinkers insisted that reason was the deiform facultywhich raised human beings far above the beasts and placed them near the angels,in relation to whom they were in the biblical phrase “a little lower” only onaccount of the inconvenience of their materiality. Unfortunately it was no smallinconvenience. O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt. Human indenture toappetite, human morbidity, above all human mortality were all badges of a fallennature strictly limited in its rational horizons.Think for a moment of the pilgrim Dante’s two guides in the Divine Comedy:Virgil and Beatrice. They are much more than simple ciphers for Reason andRevelation, but they do exemplify the special capacities of those two realms.Virgil is the greatest poet of Latinity, and in the tradition Dante inheritedone of the world’s greatest intellects. He might rightly be regarded by theLatin Middle Ages as the exemplar of the highest achievements of human thought.Beatrice was a young girl Dante saw a couple of times in Florence. Yet Beatriceleads Dante where Virgil cannot tread. She has the answers to those questionsVirgil can only ask.The general tendency of the Enlightenment was to constrain if not abolish therealm of Revelation, with the ground lost to Revelation quickly annexed to therealm of Reason. Among the famous and highly influential books of theEnlightenment is one by the Irish philosopher John Toland. Its title iseloquent: Christianity not Mysterious (1696). The first recorded appearance ofthe English word “free-thinker,” found in the writings of the philosopherBerkeley, is applied by him to Toland. Toland was not an atheist, nor were mostother “free-thinkers.” Atheism is the exception rather than the rule among theenlightened. But their “theology,” such as it was, was of a distinctlyminimalist character.The minimalism had an ancient ancestry in the medieval doctrine of invisibiliaper visibilia. That was the Latin phrase of a passage in Paul’s Epistle to theRomans (1:20): “For since the creation of the world [God’s] invisible attributesare clearly seen—his everlasting power also and divinity—being understoodthrough the things that are made.” The idea in the passage is a commonplace of“natural” theology and became the basis for the “argument by design.” It is veryfrequently found in Enlightenment texts, one memorable appearance being that inDaniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719). One day Crusoe finds on the sandy beachof his island the imprint of an unshod human foot. He reasons that if there is afootprint, there had to be a foot that made it, and it will turn out that thefoot belongs to his man Friday, the second most important character in thenovel. But the discovery leads Crusoe to contemplate the marvelous workings ofProvidence, and the manner in which the uncreated Creator manifests Himselfthrough His creatures.In medieval theology knowledge of God gained through Nature, while valid andconvincing, was of a primitive sort compared with the knowledge of God given byRevelation. “Natural” religion was a kind of spiritual first aid, or the lowestrung on a ladder of spiritual ascent. “And this our life, exempt from publichaunt,” says the Duke in the Forest of Arden,Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.What happened in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was that what for manyhad been the minimal theology of the Old World became the maximal of the New.Here the English Romantic poets have much to teach us. Not a single one of themajor Romantics (with the possible exception of Wordsworth as he approached hisdotage) had much truck with traditional Christianity. Shelley was expelled fromOxford for, among other things, his atheism. Byron was as much of a mocker inhis way as Voltaire. Yet few men more valiantly worried over those Kantianquestions raised by a mind capable of posing, but not of resolving them. Inparticular Coleridge was a genius deeply versed in Enlightenment learning,including contemporary trends, at that time so threatening, in biblicalinterpretation. He could not accept in any simple or literal way the traditionalsupernatural and mythic claims of Christianity, but he and his friend the youngWordsworth strove mightily to preserve some realm of transcendence.They found it in the world of Nature.TO DEMYSTIFY CHRISTIANITY WAS to reject its two most mysterious ancientdoctrines: the doctrine of the Incarnation (that Jesus Christ was God in humanflesh) and the doctrine of the Trinity (that God is manifested in three“persons,” Father, Son, and Holy Ghost). Neither doctrine, according to thefreethinkers, was reasonable, nor was either even to be found in the Bible. Theempirical fact of the material universe was a sufficient evidence for theexistence of its almighty Creator, but not evidence at all for the presumptuousbelief that the Creator continued to meddle in its operations or those of thehuman beings who inhabited the earth’s crust. This minimalist theology wastermed “Deism” and its proponents “Deists.”What Immanuel Kant called the “peculiar fate” of human reason to propose andworry over questions it cannot seem to answer or dismiss might be called,metaphorically, “the religious gene.” In good eighteenth-century fashion, Kantregarded the doomed search after mysteries as an aspect of the very nature ofhuman reason. Nature may be deflected, but it will not finally be denied. Inthis regard it is useful to invoke a well-known apothegm of Horace, perhaps theeighteenth century’s favorite Latin poet: Naturam expellas furca, tamen usquerevenit (“You may drive Nature out with a pitchfork; she will neverthelessreturn”).It is meet that the Enlightenment, as an age of bold thought and great advancesin human intellection, should have attracted the penetrating erudition of somany able historians. In the manner of historians they have been energetic indefining peculiarities and in drawing distinctions. To some of these I havealready referred. We have national Enlightenments in their significantvariations—German, French, Scottish. We have Enlightenment of varying politicalshades—“moderate” Enlightenment, “radical” Enlightenment. We have a“Counter-Enlightenment” asserted, debunked, and reaffirmed. We have prominent“enemies of Enlightenment.” In this book, however, I am taking a more tolerantand Latitudinarian approach to Enlightenment. How would it be possible not tosee Count Cagliostro, for example, as a quintessentially Enlightenment figure?Most of the materials dealt with here are the sometimes whimsical evidences ofthe operations of the religious gene resisting its expulsion and seeking newtemporary habitations to replace those from which it had been evicted.Large social and intellectual changes of the kind I want to suggest are seldomimmediate or complete. The American Constitution, a noble monument ofenlightened liberal democracy, accommodated certain Aristotelian ideas that mustseem to contemporary Americans simply fantastic. The very peculiar way thedocument dances around the subject of chattel slavery shows at least that thesubject was troublesome in the minds of the framers, but there is scant evidenceof any serious thought about women’s suffrage. Despite such peculiarities, fewwould deny that the American Constitution evidenced a very dramatic change inthe way people imagined their political arrangements. Many would argue that theThirteenth and Nineteenth amendments to the Constitution (the first abolishingslavery, the second enfranchising women) were simply the inevitable and logicalimplications of the document, awaiting only certain “game-changing”circumstances for their implementation. In the year 2000, a well-received bookby Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea of the “tipping point” in the processof change. His argument is Aesop’s old fable of the straw that broke the camel’sback expanded to book length, and exemplified by such phenomena as the amazingcommercial success of Hush Puppy shoes. The realm of ideas, which are frequentlyno less fashion accessories than handbags or footwear, is the realm of thetipping point par excellence. The Enlightenment was a huge tipping point in ourcultural history, the aggregate of dozens of smaller mental tipping pointsreached at different times and in different places.Stasis and ChangeAll history must necessarily be concerned either with change or with stasis, andoften enough it is a record of the struggle between the two. It is safe to saythat on the whole historians, particularly modern historians, prefer change. Forthis reason, many famous historical titles include such words as “evolution,”“emergence,” “development,” “rise,” “fall,” “decline,” “expansion,” “triumph,”“eclipse,” and so forth. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is a terrifictitle. Four Centuries of Stasis in Burgundian Agriculture would be lessterrific. Much of the subject matter of this book has to do with the oftenunanticipated possibilities brought about by change—one of which is an importantshift in attitudes toward change itself.One of the great founders of the discipline of anthropology, Edward BurnettTylor, proclaimed with elegance and economy a radical principle of culturalconservatism. According to Tylor, most things that exist in the world exist forthe reason that they once existed. “When a custom, an art, or an opinion isfairly started in the world, disturbing influences may long affect it soslightly that it may keep its course from generation to generation, as a streamonce settled in its bed will flow on for ages.… This is the permanence ofculture; and the special wonder about it is that the change and revolution ofhuman affairs should have left so many of its feeblest rivulets to run so long.”In his first campaign for the presidency, Barack Obama chose to express one ofhis major themes in the catchy motto “Change You Can Believe In.” Withoutsubjecting this curious phrase to the kind of serious examination that nopolitical slogan could sustain, it is worth noting one or two things about it.The assumption, in the first place, is that such change would be change for thegood. Indeed, one could go further. Perhaps change, in and of itself, is aterminal good.Mr. Obama’s adversaries and rivals were not against change. Although it is inthe nature of conservatism to be wary of change, the conservative objections tohis proposals appeared to be based in the belief that they were not “change” atall, but rather covert stasis, “the same old failed policies.” Since much of thespecific “change” Obama advocated had also been proposed by others in the pastand by some competitors in the present, in one of the candidates’ debatesHillary Clinton in effect accused Obama of plagiarism or, as she put it, “changeyou can Xerox.” This criticism was not well received by the debate audience orby those who commented upon it afterwards, though the generally negativereaction implied no displeasure with change itself.There are other points of view. One of the great men of the English seventeenthcentury, Lord Falkland, famously stated that “when it is not necessary tochange, it is necessary not to change.” He was apparently talking about theepiscopal form of ecclesiastical governance, but his dictum has become awatchword for certain ideological conservatives, who have applied it widely. Itis an idea that contrasts sharply with another—namely, the necessity of changeunder all circumstances. Such was the concept of the “permanent revolution”advocated by certain modern Marxists and others.The term “progressive” comes of course from progress. In Latin pro + gradior,with its participle gressus, meant to walk in a forward direction (as opposed toretro + gradior, moving backwards). Formerly one could make literal progress inany activity involving movement with a definite end (walking to the Coliseum) ormetaphoric progress in many others (painting a fence, reading a book, learning alanguage, etc.). The literal meaning has virtually disappeared from modernEnglish, though it is preserved in the title of John Bunyan’s once famousPilgrim’s Progress. Today “progress,” at least as an item in the politicallexicon, always implies amelioration—in other words, change for the better,improvement. This usage definitely dates from the Enlightenment. It is preservedin the titles of numerous European learned societies established for theprogress of knowledge or the improvement of the arts. Among the most famous ofthese was the British Royal Society—the founding title of which is the RoyalSociety of London for Improving Natural Knowledge.Certain strains of “progressive” political thought, such as political Marxism,posit a more or less definite goal, upon reaching which progress presumablyceases, as the man ceases walking once he reaches the Coliseum. On the whole,however, modern progress is open-ended, directed toward an indefinite perfectionthat by a kind of metaphysical Zeno’s Paradox it will never achieve, acircumstance that, far from being depressing, actually allows indefiniteprogress. We may regard this as a sort of political Couéism, after the Frenchself-help guru Emile Coué, who counseled his followers to improve their livesthrough autosuggestion by frequently repeating the mantra: Tous les jours à touspoints de vue je vais de mieux en mieux (“Every day in every way, I am gettingbetter and better”).THE TOPIC OF THE PROPER boundaries of optimism is one that has frequently beenraised in relationship to the Enlightenment, as for example in theintellectually influential book by Horkheimer and Adorno. Critics have raised ametaphysical version of the old accusation—If you’re so smart, why aren’t yourich? Of course the question was perhaps most interestingly raised by theenlightened themselves. Here the important exemplary text is Voltaire’s Candide,subtitled “Optimism,” which appeared in 1759. Voltaire was too much of a scoffernot to scoff even at scoffing; hence the ironies of the work are nearly endless.Nonetheless it still has a clear enough Enlightenment drift. The meaning of theword “candid” in the eighteenth century had not yet strayed far from the Latin.It meant generous, ingenuous, innocent, straightforward—untouched by thecynicism that is often the diploma granted by the school of sophistication andworldly experience.The character Candide, a young man of candor in this sense, has been taught byhis tutor Pangloss to believe that “this is the best of all possible worlds.”When cast out into the cruel world as a result of an innocent sexual appetite,he has ample opportunity to test his mentor’s maxim. After experiencing a jollyauto-da-fé ostensibly organized to prevent a repetition of the Lisbonearthquake, the hero is forced to ponder: “If this is the best of all possibleworlds, what can the others be like?” In other words, Pangloss’s bromide is moreconvincing as pessimism than as optimism.This fact by no means suggests that Voltaire himself was mired in gloom,however. The chief source of obscurantism in Candide, revealed religion, was inthe form of Roman Catholicism—the “infamous thing” it was his life’s work to“crush.” He and his like-minded enthusiasts of Enlightenment had every reason torejoice in their progress. By the time he died an old man in 1778, France was nolonger simply on a pathway toward a revolution largely prepared by the kind ofEnlightenment thought he so brilliantly exemplified, but in its very vestibule.Thus modern optimism reaches the threshold of parody, where it has been longawaited, perhaps, by the more excessive expressions of ancient pessimism. In theold poetic pre-Copernican astronomy, mutability reigned everywhere beneath themoon. Hence the invariably negative metaphoric sense of the adjective“sublunary”—meaning mortal, fickle, changeable, material, temporal, impermanent,imperfect. The moon itself was an emblem of mutability. When Romeo would swearupon the moon his undying love of Juliet, she responds in alarm:O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,That monthly changes in her circled orb …Mutability—the slow decay of the human body, the crumbling of stone buildings,the brevity of fleshly pleasures—all these things seemed to confirm the wisdomof the world-denying asceticism that shaped so much of the cultural life of theOld World. Of all unstable creatures, none were more unstable that human beings.“I will show you a great wonder” says Lady Philosophy to Boethius: “a man happyand despairing within the space of a single hour.”THE “DARKER” ENLIGHTENMENT PHENOMENA touched upon in this book—the reluctance ofthe miraculous to capitulate and leave the field, the esoteric enthusiasms ofeighteenth-century Rosicrucians and Freemasons, the extraordinary careers of aCagliostro or a Julie de Krüdener—are to be found lodged in the crevices of therocky and uneven landscape of major cultural change. When we think of decisiveepochs of Western history, we are likely to point to the collapse of the RomanEmpire in late Antiquity, or to the renaissance of the twelfth century or itsgreater and capitalized sibling, the Renaissance. Yet no century constitutes amore emphatic punctuation point in European history than the eighteenth. Theworld of the year 1700 differed from that of the year 1800 in many profoundways—intellectual, spiritual, economic, political, demographic. Most change isgradual, but intellectual change supremely so. The French Revolution couldimpose by force the abolition of titles of social rank and the fraternity of allcitizens. Such changes in the direction of democracy gained the assent of actualindividuals at very different tempos.The Crevices of HistoryWhat I mean by the crevices of history can perhaps be exemplified by brieflyconsidering one or two large and consequential developments in the history ofEuropean thought in the Enlightenment period, developments that appeared andflourished at different rates of speed in different places and contexts, andthat gained the adherence of some more easily than of others.There is a family of allegorical tableaux painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder andsome of his followers called Law and Grace or Justice and Grace. Cranach was apersonal friend of Martin Luther, of whom he painted portraits, and hispictorial theology is often didactic Protestantism. Law and Grace, the mostfamous example of which is the painting housed in Prague Castle, is a tellingexemplification of Luther’s doctrine of “justification by faith.” As the gloomyGerman friar brooded over the fourth chapter of Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, alight flashed within his mind. “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to himas righteousness.” You cannot do anything to be saved except believe that youcannot do anything. Giving up the pleasures of the flesh and disciplining bodilyappetite won’t save you. Certainly building a huge cathedral in Rome won’t. Theonly channel of salvation is divine grace, absolutely arbitrary and unmerited,indeed unmeritable.In Cranach’s pictorial scheme there are within a single frame two starklycontrasting landscapes separated by a central tree. The tree itself isallegorical, divided along its vertical axis into two halves, one dead andblasted, the other green and flourishing. In the left-hand scene, death reigns.There is a corpse in its coffin, Adam and Eve beside the fatal tree, Hebrewsattacked by fiery serpents in the background, and above it all the Tables of theLaw against murky clouds. The right half is the realm of grace. Here the chiefelements are John the Baptist pointing to the Lamb of God, and the Lamb himselffirst on the Cross, then exiting his tomb. High above on a peak Grace,allegorized as a beautiful woman, looks over the scene. The meaning is veryclear. Grace, not justice, is the only hope of salvation. Indeed to hope forjustice is to ask for death. In the left (“Law”) side of Cranach’s image deathis everywhere, including the left half of the tree that divides it. Only thegratuitous grace of Christ’s sacrifice offers hope.We argue still about what things are rights and what things are privileges. Thegreat French historian Jules Michelet (1798–1874) began what is perhaps his mostfamous single work, The History of the French Revolution, with an introductoryessay entitled “Concerning the Religion of the Middle Ages.” He sought, he said,to answer the indispensable question concerning the French Revolution: Was theFrench Revolution Christian or anti-Christian? That may strike one as an oddquestion, since most of us are likely to call to mind such famous revolutionaryepisodes as the mass murder of Carmelites, or such widespread phenomena as thedesecration and demolition of churches, or such legislative initiatives as theCivil Constitution of the Clergy.Michelet was a determined secularist. He was, furthermore, genuinely appalled atthe Christian history of his own country, which included such horrors as theAlbigensian crusade and the massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day. But he was not ananti-Catholic bigot or a crude propagandist. He was trying to look deeper, tothe very philosophical foundations of revolution. He finally concluded that theRevolution was founded in the concept of justice, whereas the Christian economywas founded in the concept of grace. Man had sinned. Man had been saved by thesacrifice of Jesus Christ. No merit of his own had gained his salvation; allflowed from divine grace, a gift that could never be earned. Man had no right tosalvation.Two unfortunate implications flowed from this doctrine, and both encouraged thearbitrary at the expense of the just. The first was that human politicalarrangements were founded in a nexus of grace and favor. The relationships offeudalism were anything but lawless, but they sounded everywhere with echoes ofthe divine condescension. There was an ideological thread, however finely spun,between the great Lord of the Heavens and the local “lord of the manor.”The foundation of the Old World was a supposed divine order, everywhereexhibited by the world of nature and sought after, however imperfectly, in humaninstitutions. The “divine right of kings” did not mean that any particular kingwas divinely right, but that kingship itself was. Human monarchy echoed thedivine order. The principal word for “God” in the Bible was Dominus (Lord). Inthe vocabulary of Old Europe that was a political term, denoting one who haspossession, claims authority, and exercises power. Its Englishdescendants—“domain,” “dominion,” “dominate,” and so forth—preserve its sense.Don Quixote, an Oxford don, or for that matter a Mafia one, are its distantechoes.Thus in Hamlet, Claudius (though himself a king-killer) at least imagineshimself invulnerable:There’s such divinity doth hedge a kingThat treason can but peep to what it would,Acts little of his will.The second baneful implication related to the clergy who, in Michelet’s opinion,could hardly avoid, under such a theological system, claiming for themselves thearbitrary powers of semi-divine dispensers of sacramental grace.The Revolution, on the contrary, was legal and contractural. It claimed itsbasis in droit—a word that in French bears the burden of two English words,“law” and “right.” The primary document of the French Revolution, the moralequivalent of the American Declaration of Independence, which indeed influencedit, is The Declaration of the Rights of Man as Citizen. The American Declarationof Independence speaks of “certain inalienable rights” which have been “endowed”by man’s Creator. This is, however, about as untheological as a theologicalcommonplace can be.THE PRESUMPTION OF A political order at least theoretically based in thedemocratic dogma approaches the status of an innate idea in America and the restof the “enlightened” world. We need to remind ourselves how new the idea is. Theopening paragraphs of the Politics of Aristotle come as a shock to mostcontemporary undergraduates who, knowing in advance that Aristotle’s is a namegreat in the annals of human thought, suppose also that his thought will begenerally attuned to their own. Instead, Aristotle starts with several alarmingsuppositions presumed by him to be natural truths: the authority exercised bymasters over slaves and the superiority of men to women. Very right, he says, isthat line in Hesiod: “It is meet that Hellenes should rule over Barbarians.”The apparently abstract question—“Justice or grace?”—has concrete implicationsof the very greatest moment. There are numerous other weighty abstractions thatwere in flux in the period of the Enlightenment. They may encourage us to put tothe Enlightenment the same question Michelet put to the Revolution: was theEnlightenment Christian or anti-Christian? The materials dealt with in this bookshow how difficult it is to give a decisive, clear-cut answer. The medievalistD. W. Robertson invoked the concepts of “hierarchy” and “dynamically interactingpolarities” to identify one of the most consequential contrasts between theolder and the newer mental worlds. A great deal of modern thought has beenfounded in one form or another on belief in the progressive power of dynamicallyinteracting polarities. This may be described as the Hegelian paradigm. Thesis Aencounters Antithesis B, resulting in something new and different from both,Synthesis C. The Marxist analysis, which in a variety of manifestations has beenenormously influential for the better part of two centuries, is founded in thebelief that “all previous history is the history of class struggle.”The dynamic idea is congenial to the Darwinian theory of evolutionary adaptationand of the “survival of the fittest.” It accords with Freud’s theories ofsubconscious struggle as a mainspring of human action.Here the inevitable metaphor has been that of the body. So pervasive is theimage in ancient literature that it has attracted more than one learned study.For our purposes, we can safely fast-forward to the Apostolic age and theletters of St. Paul, and in particular to his repeated descriptions of theChurch as “the body of Christ,” and especially in the extended metaphor in theFirst Letter to the Corinthians (I Cor. 12: 12–31).The salient point, perhaps, is that Paul combines the ideas of organic unity andhierarchical subordination. All the members of the body are “worthy”; all haveuseful functions. But the image is anything but “democratic,” let aloneanarchic. Christ is the “head” of the Church in precisely the way that someoneis the head of General Motors or the head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.There developed in medieval Europe a tripartite pattern of social organization,often invoked in pictorial form by the image of a group of three men: one anarmed knight; one a tonsured cleric; one identifiable as a peasant by someattribute of his agricultural labor. These were the “three Estates.” “I fightfor you,” said the knight. “I pray for you,” said the cleric. “I work for you,”said the peasant. The Assembly of the Estates-General called by Louis XVI in thehopes of securing tax revenues from them was structured around this ossifiedsocial structure; the Revolution to which the Estates-General acted as midwifesuggests how obsolete it had in reality become.Paradise LostThe same phenomena viewed from opposite ends of a period of dramaticintellectual change may look very different. The Dark Side of the Enlightenmentbegins with an obscure Anglo-Irish squire, Valentine Greatrakes, in the 1660s.This man’s moment of greatest fame almost exactly coincided with the publicationof the first edition of John Milton’s Paradise Lost in 1667. Paradise Lost is anepic poem based in the history of Adam and Eve as recounted in the first twochapters of the Book of Genesis. Milton’s poem treats the subject in a baroqueand learned style that mingles, in the classical style of Christian humanism,the Hebrew Scriptures with the literary and mythological opulence of ancientGreece and Rome. The subject of Paradise Lost is “the Fall of Man,” the“original sin” of ancient Christian theological orthodoxy.The results of the primal transgression were catastrophic, for sin “broughtdeath into the World, and all our woe, with loss of Eden.” Our human ancestors,now rendered mortal by their own disobedience, were banished into the harshworld of labor and necessity—our world. This myth was universally understoodamong Christian thinkers both as an historical account of the primal fall and anallegory of every act of sin in which sensuality masters reason and willfulnessconquers a required obedience.John Milton, an actual revolutionary both in politics and in art, very clearlygrounded his poem in a strictly static hierarchy of the Great Chain of Being.There was a metaphysical pyramid with God at its apex. Just below that were thehierarchically ordered angels. A “little lower than the angels” were humanbeings, with man the superior to woman. Below that were all the animals andbirds, all of vegetative life from the mighty oak to the lichen scabrous uponthe stone, then the stones and minerals themselves, down to the meanest clods ofthe earth. “A place for everything and everything in its place.” Sin at its corewas the overthrow of divinely established hierarchies, turning things upsidedown. The woman/sensuality controlled the man/reason. Sin at its core was themanifestation of things not staying in their proper places.IN 1793—NEAR THE endpoint of the period dealt with in this book—theproto-Romantic English poet and artist William Blake created a work called TheMarriage of Heaven and Hell. If ever there was a title that dramatized thenotion of dynamically interacting polarities, it was this title. The Marriagetakes Paradise Lost as its point of departure, and it makes the followingcriticism of it: “Note: The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote ofAngels & God, and at liberty when of Devils & Hell, is because he was a truePoet and of the Devils party without knowing it.”The idea that Milton was subconsciously “of the Devils party”—or putting it inmore forceful terms that Satan is the true hero of Paradise Lost and GodAlmighty its true villain—has become one of the orthodoxies of modern literaryhistory. It seems to accord with our sense of what is good and true, and itseems confirmed by the nature of the verse. Milton’s God is arbitrary andautocratic, and His words, when compared with Satan’s fiery speeches, areboring. According to one famous interpretation, by the literary critic WilliamEmpson, Milton’s God is actively evil. Satan, on the other hand, is dynamic.Pandemonium—the parliament of all the devils—is less like a royal court than ademocratic senate. There is verbal thrust and verbal parry, the most fundamentalchallenging of authority. Non serviam, cries Satan. I shall not serve. His mostmemorable line may be “Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven!”Despite tortured attempts to attribute this “reading” to Milton’s consciousintention, it seems impossible that a seventeenth-century English Puritan wouldwrite a biblical epic in which God is the villain and Satan the hero, or that itwould be received by nearly the entire Protestant eighteenth century as thegreatest Christian poem ever written. Slightly more plausible, but onlyslightly, is the notion that such an interpretation reveals a subconsciousirresolution within John Milton. It is much more likely that what seemedmanifestly clear to the twentieth-century literary critic Empson never occurredto anybody for a century or more after the poem’s publication. When, however,the Old World view of the Great Chain of Being and the rightness of fixedhierarchies gives way to a very different view—of the generative power ofdynamically interacting polarities—the phenomena may look very different. Yetunless we are willing to turn all of cultural history into a vast Rorschach testthat can tell us only what is already in our own minds, we need to make astrenuous effort to grasp something very different from what may already bethere. “A perfect judge will read each work of wit,” says Alexander Pope, “Withthe same spirit that its author writ.”Scholars must cooperate with their publishers and their readers in honoring animperative of originality, but they can surrender to it entirely only at somerisk. Some topics—as for example the French Revolution—have been written aboutfor so long, in such depth, and by so many historians writing from so manydiffering “perspectives” that it is actually not plausible to claim that one’sown ideas are “original.” The Dark Side of the Enlightenment hopes to offer somefresh perspectives, but hardly pretends to break new ground on every page. Someof the materials in this book have been frequently studied, such as variousaspects of eighteenth-century esotericism. There are numerous English-languagebooks about Count Cagliostro. Most of them take a very different view from theone I have come to credit; but he is, in any event, far too compelling andcomplicating a figure to omit from such a study. Valentine Greatrakes and Madamede Krüdener, on the other hand, are scarcely known at all outside the world ofspecialized scholarship.The anxious scholar may gain some comfort in subscribing to Alexander Pope’sdefinition of “wit.” True wit, he wrote,is Nature to advantage dress’d,What oft was thought, but ne’er so well express’d.Put in other terms, the reinvention of the wheel remains a sacred duty of everygeneration of scholars. What one hopes to avoid is the reinvention of the flattire.The reinvention of the wheel, indeed, turns out to have a good deal to do withthe extraordinary intellectual ferment of the Enlightenment period, which inEurope witnessed a dramatic increase in international travel and communication.The word “coach” (meaning the wheeled conveyance) is a rare example of anEnglish word of Hungarian (Magyar) origin. It derives from a place name, Kocs,an Hungarian village that at the end of the Middle Ages was already a famouscenter of wheelmaking. Improved wheel technology gradually moved westward acrossEurope. Lázló Tarr, the definitive historian of the coach (The History of theCarriage, 1969, translated from the Hungarian), documents the gradualimprovements in the ancient invention of wheeled conveyances that had led, bythe beginning of the eighteenth century, to a considerable elevation in thestatus of the wheelwright. Improvements included several features of body designand suspension, but the wheel itself was also improved through more accuratelathing of the barrel hub, more precise auguring of the spoke holes, and moreeffective smithing of the rims. These were all small technical increments, yettheir effects enabled significant social change. Creating roads worthy of thenew and improved vehicles often lagged behind, but John Loudon McAdam, inventorof the macadam or metaled road, was as pure a product of the ScottishEnlightenment as David Hume or Dugald Stewart.BibliographicalThe bibliography for the vast topic of the Enlightenment might well be as longas this entire book. The general reader seeking to explore the topic will notwant for elegant and illuminating general studies. Among the classics availablein English are Ernst Cassirer, The Philosophy of the Enlightenment (Princeton,1951), and Peter Gay, The Enlightenment: An Interpretation, 2 vols. (New York,1997). Two books I find particularly readable are Harold Nicolson’s The Age ofReason, the Eighteenth Century (New York, 1961) and Daniel Roche’s France in theEnlightenment (Cambridge, MA, 1998, first publ. in French in 1993). Somewhatmore traditionally academic, but invaluable for its literary breadth, is IraWade, The Intellectual Origins of the French Enlightenment (Princeton, 1971).One of the most prominent of modern intellectual historians, Jonathan Israel,has devoted many of his books to topics relevant to the period, and especiallytwo magisterial volumes—Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making ofModernity, 1650–1750 (Oxford, 2001) and Enlightenment Contested: Philosophy,Modernity, and the Emancipation of Man, 1670–1752 (Oxford, 2006).There are also a number of valuable specialized reference works, especially theEncyclopedia of the Enlightenment, 4 vols., ed. Alan Charles Kors (Oxford,2003). Less ambitious but highly useful is Harvey Chisick, Historical Dictionaryof the Enlightenment (Lanham, MD, 2005).Of more specialized academic books I am obliged to mention two that wereinstrumental in exciting my interest in the topics of this book. The first isthe two-volume work of Auguste Viatte, Les sources occultes du Romantisme(Paris, 1928, with subsequent editions). The other is Giovanna Summerfield,Credere aude: Mystifying Enlightenment (Tübingen, 2008), dealing principallywith figures not specifically covered in this book.Books specifically cited or alluded to in this chapter:Edmund Burke, Reflections on the French Revolution (1790).D.

The Almighty works by“general laws”—what we would call natural laws—not by an arbitrary or “partial”interference in human affairs. This might be called the Retired Watchmakertheory. Having once established the magnificent mechanism of the universe, itsCreator has withdrawn, allowing it to operate on its own sufficient andunwavering regularity.A miracle is an interference with or abrogation of “general laws.” One importantaspect of radical Enlightenment thought was its denial of the miraculous.Enlightened scientists said that miracles were impossible in the world theyobserved. Enlightened historians and scriptural scholars struggled with thequestion of whether the miracles reported in the Bible ever could have occurredas described. That was a debate that continued throughout the Enlightenment, andso must recur throughout this book. What concerns us here are two episodes ofthe dramatic intrusion of contemporary miracles upon an evolving intellectualworld in which they were distinctly unwelcome.I. An Anglo-Irish Country GentlemanAffane is a rural place in County Wexford in the south of Ireland, about midwaybetween the county towns of Wexford and Cork. At the time of the Restoration ofKing Charles II in 1660 there was living at Affane an obscure country squirewith the imposing name of Valentine Greatrakes, a surname still surviving in anumber of orthographic variants such as Gretorex, Gretraches, etc. He had beenborn in 1628, and thus achieved his majority in the year of the execution ofCharles I. Though he was of an old Irish family, the political disquiets of histime had made an exile of him, and he grew up in Devon in southern England. Hehad been a “Parliament man” in his first youth and a commissioned officer of theRoundhead army. In religion he had been a latter-day Puritan and an enemy ofepiscopacy. However, he had otherwise shown few signs of unusual religiosity,except that he had been an admirer of the Lutheran mystic Jakob Boehme (d.1624). This was not particularly remarkable, since Boehme’s influence was strongin many places throughout Protestant Europe. Furthermore, Greatrakes had as ayouth in Devon studied under the guidance of a German tutor.images [../Images/p37.jpg]“The Manner of His Majesties Curing the Disease, called the King’s-Evil.” Therestored monarch, Charles II, was eager to revive such ideas of sacred kingshipas were still alive after Cromwell. This broadsheet from the 1660s described theceremony in detail, including the proper liturgical readings. (Note the twopriests with liturgical books kneeling at either side of the “patient.”)The re-establishment of monarchy in Britain was relatively irenic. Grotesquepunishments were visited upon the still living regicides and gross indignitieson the corpses of the dead ones. But formal and informal amnesties let bygonesbe bygones for the large mass of the old republican aristocracy and armyveterans. Greatrakes had accepted the re-established order and had made a formalact of conformity to re-established Anglicanism. He left the army in 1656. Hewas living comfortably though not idly on his remote farm when, one morning in1662, he awoke with a strange notion. To comprehend it, insofar as it wascomprehensible at all, requires a little medical and social history.The disease called scrofula was common in premodern Europe. Scrofula was atubercular inflammation of the lymph nodes (cervical lymphodenitis) in the neck.Its external manifestations, which were often prominent and revolting, includedlarge, angry-looking protuberances on the neck, shoulders, arms, and face.Scrofula was a highly visible ailment, which could not be hidden or disguised.The neck swelling was not painful but it could lead to the opening of lesionsand invite other infection. With the general conquest of tuberculosis, scrofulavirtually disappeared in the West, though it made something of a comeback in theAIDS epidemic.Another name for scrofula in England was the “King’s evil.” That name preservedan ancient belief in the thaumaturgical powers of royalty, a bit of medievalsuperstition that survived the Reformation. It was believed by many that areigning monarch could, with the touch of his hand, cure scrofula. Sincemedieval times in England there had been formal occasions on which the reigningmonarch “touched” sufferers from scrofula, or those seeking inoculation againstit, just as there were formal ceremonies for other ritual acts of charity, suchas the distribution of the Maundy monies. It is of possible relevance to thehistory of Greatrakes that Charles II had begun “touching” almost immediatelyupon his placement on the throne. The diarist John Evelyn was present at asession in July 1660: “The chirurgeons caused the sick to be brought or led, upto the throne, where they kneeling, the King strokes their faces or cheeks withboth his hands at once, at which instant a chaplain in his formalities says, ‘Heput his hands upon them, and he healed them.’ [Luke 4:40] This is said to everyone in particular.” Since the biblical reference is of course to the healingmiracles of Jesus Christ, the suggestion of such divinity as doth hedge a kingwas hardly subtle. There was also a close parallel with the words uttered by thepriest when administering Holy Communion. This practice of regal “touching”actually continued up until the Georgian period. Queen Anne “touched” the infantSamuel Johnson.The idea that had entered the mind of Valentine Greatrakes was that he, too,could cure the King’s evil. The idea apparently simply appeared in his mind,suddenly and fully grown, in the manner that a sense of religious assurance hadonce come upon Blaise Pascal and would later come upon John Wesley. “I had animpulse or a strange persuasion in my own mind (of which I am not able to giveany rational account to another) which did very frequently suggest to me, thatthere was bestowed on me the gift of curing the King’s evil.”Greatrakes’s experience—the inner conviction of a suddenly appearing miraculousgrace—has many general parallels in religious history, and it will be found indifferent forms in William James’s Varieties of Religious Experience. Hisreaction was, compared with that of many of his mystical peers, cautious andcontained. He rather diffidently told his wife Ruth of his “strange persuasion”;she found it more strange than persuasive. He spoke to no one else of it, but itcontinued to occupy his mind.A fortuitous opportunity to test his intuition shortly presented itself. Acountry man named Maher, from the nearby settlement of Salterbridge, appeared atthe manor house at Affane on business of some sort. He was accompanied by hisyoung son, who was terribly afflicted with visible scrofula eruptions on hisneck, shoulders, and face. He seemed in danger of losing an eye to the rampagingblisters. We have only Greatrakes’s own account of what happened, and it isspare. His motive in attempting a cure seems in the first instance to have beento prove himself in the face of his wife’s stinging skepticism. He walked up tothe boy, put his hands upon him, and said a prayer.Nothing dramatic happened immediately, but a few days later the Mahers returnedin some excitement. Now there was a dramatic physical improvement. The scabrouslumps had retreated from the area of the eye. The throat and neck areas werealmost clear. Within a few weeks all signs of scrofula had completelydisappeared from the body of young Maher.Scrofula is not necessarily a fatal disease, and people do recover from it. Itshorrible stigmata appear, but they can also in time go away. Still, the noise ofthe Maher affair reverberated through the local parishes. Now one MargaretMcShane of Ballinecly, apparently a poor cottager, appeared at Greatrakes’sgate. She had a horrible case of scrofula. “She looked so dreadfully and stunkso exceedingly, that she would have affrighted and poisoned anyone almost thatsaw or came near her.”There is in this story a “hagiographic topos,” a theme recurrent in the oldliterature of sanctity, according to which the saint himself must overcome astrong initial revulsion to the maladies he cures. It is in serving that we areserved, in healing that we are healed. “When I was still in my sins,” saidFrancis of Assisi, “lepers were hateful to me.” A cardinal stage in hisconversion was ratified when he forced himself to embrace and kiss a leper.Greatrakes approached the hideous McShane. “My hands suppurated the nodes, anddrew and healed the sores, which formerly I could not have endured the sight of,nor smell, nor touched without vomiting, so great an aversion had I naturally toall wounds and sores.”The McShane healing was once again one of delayed action. At the end of asix-week period of steady improvement, the woman found herself entirely cured.Gathering her widow’s mite in the form of a basket of hazelnuts, she returned,like the lone Samaritan leper, to give thanks to her healer.This second healing was crucial for Greatrakes. By chance a local physician, aneighborhood acquaintance, had been visiting the manor at the very time McShaneappeared. Greatrakes had first asked this man, Anthony, to treat the woman.Anthony demurred, ostensibly on the grounds that the disease was too faradvanced to be curable. Greatrakes suspected, however, that the real reason wasthat the doctor saw no prospect of a fee from this peasant woman. The avarice ofmedical men is a recurrent theme of the old social satire. It is already inclassical Latin literature. It is in Petrarch’s “Invective Against a Doctor.” Itis in Chaucer’s portrait of his “Doctour of Phisik”:And yet he was but esy of dispence;He kepte that he wan in pestilence.Greatrakes’s lack of cupidity became a major theme in his career. He may haveaccepted the gift of McShane’s hazelnuts, but he was scrupulous about refusingall other payment. There may be little difference between the Healing Hand andthe Midas Touch. At the height of his fame Greatrakes could have made a largefortune out of his cures. He refused to take a penny, and he punished someservants who had accepted from grateful beneficiaries the medical equivalent offinder’s fees for facilitating access to their master.In reprimanding Dr. Anthony for his presumed materialism, Greatrakes had blurtedout that he would cure McShane himself. Anthony had replied with indignationthat if Greatrakes could cure McShane, he could cure any ailment on earth. As hecertainly did not believe that Greatrakes could cure any ailment on earth, wehere anticipate one of the important themes of Greatrakes’s history: the naturalhostility of the official medical profession to unconventional anduncredentialed “practitioners.” It is a theme that appears again withCagliostro, and no doubt in many other places. The medical profession on thewhole distrusted Greatrakes because he was healing people. The Church would onthe whole distrust Greatrakes because he appeared in the eyes of many to beperforming miracles in the name of the founder of Christianity, who was afterall reported to have said that faith the size of a mustard seed would besufficient to move a mountain.Greatrakes did not document the next three years of his life in detail, but itis clear that he healed “many” sufferers from the King’s evil in County Wexford.His reputation as a healer was growing, but as yet it remained local. Anotherdevelopment familiar in the careers of medieval wonder-workers now appeared:Greatrakes experienced a gradual increment in the understanding of his gift,which impelled him from specialization in scrofula to what we might call generalpractice. Before following him there, however, it is necessary to say a fewwords about his therapeutic method.He was called “the Stroker” because of the peculiar method with which he“touched” his patients. The ritual of regal touching observed by John Evelynmakes it clear that belief in the efficacy of the King’s touch had a literarybasis in the scriptural accounts of the healing miracles of Christ. Ordinarily,Jesus healed the sick simply by touching or “laying hands” on them. On oneoccasion he made an effective opthalmological ointment by mixing his spittlewith dust (John 9:6–7). On another (Luke 8:37–48), a woman tried to heal herselfby touching the extreme fringe of Jesus’s garment as he passed through a crowd.Though Jesus did not see her do this, he felt it. “Someone did touch me, for Ifelt that power had gone out from me.” This comes closer to the language ofancient magic than any other account of Christ’s healing miracles. It seems tosuggest on the part of the wonder-worker a finite store of “power” that candecrease and that is not entirely within his own volitional control. All theseare themes finding an echo in the history of Valentine Greatrakes.Over the long course of his career as a healer Greatrakes sometimes succeededentirely, sometimes partially, and sometimes not at all. Certain remarks he madesuggest that he may have believed that his access to “the power” was variable orintermittent, and subject to factors outside his control. His method of“stroking” was often described by patients or observers. It usually involvedrubbing and pressing the afflicted areas with considerable pressure, directingthe force in the direction of a bodily extremity. The patient often had thesense of the illness being expelled through fingers, toes, or capital orifices.In his account of McShane he says he “suppurated the nodes,” using a technicalmedical term meaning to expel the pus from a wound, swelling, or infection. Askeptical doctor friend of my acquaintance, who has interested herself in myaccount of Greatrakes, suggests that such a method might have indeed provided avery temporary appearance of amelioration in scrofula symptoms by breaking upthe forming fistulae.It seems apparent that Greatrakes at first regarded his “gift” as an equivalentof the King’s touch—that is, something specifically and exclusively directedtoward scrofula. This would leave room for the exploration of a possiblesubconscious political dimension to this history, but one that falls outside ourtask. It is not infrequent in the old hagiographic literature to find that thenascent saint misunderstands or only partially understands his divine calling.The crucifix still hanging in the ruined church of Damiano spoke to the youngFrancis saying, “Francis, rebuild my church.” His first response was to turnstonemason. Only later did he understand this command in a more metaphorical andspiritual sense. We find something similar here.One morning in 1664 Greatrakes awoke to the sense of an augmented medicalmission. He already knew he could cure scrofula. He now felt that “there wasbestowed upon me the gift of curing the ague.” Though he seems to speak of “theague” as some definite malady, the term actually covered many if not a multitudeof feverish ailments. In fact, the word is an English version of the Romanceform of “acute” in the medical term “acute fever,” usually meaning malaria. Hiswife proved to be a serial skeptic, but the very next day saw his vindication.Mrs. Bateman of Fallow Bridge appeared at his door trembling and sweating withthe ague. Though it is not clear how one could stroke the ague, Greatrakes curedthe woman completely and instantly. She returned the next day with severalague-stricken members of her family. He cured all of them completely andinstantly.Greatrakes, had he lived long enough, might have worked his way slowly throughthe library of the Royal College of Pathology; but on Low Sunday, April 2, 1665,he received a general revelation that God had granted him plenary therapeuticalpowers. Once again he found an early opportunity for confirmation. Business soontook him to Lismore, a market town some few miles from the neighborhood that hadbecome his therapeutic arena. There he would discover that his reputation hadpreceded him. He took the occasion to visit his old friend Cornet Dean, one ofwhose neighbors, having heard rumor of his visit, rushed over to meet him.Actually “rushed” is hardly the right word. The man was suffering from a badlyulcerated leg, which according to Greatrakes had turned completely black. Hecould barely walk with the aid of stick supports. He reported that the doctorswere advising amputation—a report rendered credible by the frequency with whichearly surgeons wielded their hideous tools. They did not get their ghoulishsobriquet “sawbones” idly. Greatrakes touched the afflicted leg, with aninstantaneous positive effect. Further touching transformed the ghastly color ofthe leg, which now glowed with a healthier red. Three of five ulcers immediatelyhealed, “and the rest within a few hours afterward.” Soon the amazed man walkedout of the house with a spring in his step and a story on his lips.There is no plausible medical explanation for the “instant” disappearance ofgaping lesions, but of course all the evidence so far considered has beenoffered by Greatrakes himself. While nothing in the man’s history suggests thathe was a liar or a conscious fraud, we still feel the force of Hume’s criterionthat it is more probable that he was mistaken or deluded than that he actuallycured with his touch a gangrened limb ripe for amputation. What created hisreputation as a miracle worker was the testimony of others. And while God is norespecter of persons, persons themselves usually are, and in the seventeenthcentury were even more likely to be. The testimony of Irish plowboys and oldwives might impress other plowboys and other old wives, but it was unlikely tobecome the buzz of the London coffeehouses.The healing of Robert Phayre was something else again. In the Civil War,Greatrakes had served under the regimental command of this man—who later, as oneof the three military officers to whom the warrant for the execution of KingCharles was addressed, became one of the technical regicides. He nonethelessescaped the selective retribution at the Restoration and, after a time, gainedthe liberty to return to the life of the squirearchy in southern Ireland. In1665, his old subordinate Greatrakes visited him at Cahemore in County Cork. Atthe moment of Greatrakes’s arrival, Phayre was suffering acutely from an ague.There is documentary eyewitness testimony in the form of a letter later writtenby one of Phayre’s sons that Greatrakes immediately stroked the illness away ina matter of moments. It is from the second half of 1665 that the Stroker’swonder-working reputation “went viral.”II. The Royal Society and theCambridge PlatonistsSo long as Greatrakes stayed in rural Ireland, his fame was likely to remainboth geographically and sociologically local. He was more than the obscure“village Hampden” of Gray’s “Elegy,” a “flower born to blush unseen.” Boatloadsof English medical pilgrims were, after all, making their way up the Blackwaterto seek him out. But he was not yet an international phenomenon. His truecelebrity, and therefore the nature of his complicating role for the formationof our notion of the Enlightenment, was naturally related to his interactionswith important men and intellectual tendencies of the age. His history requiresthe brief introduction of two groups in particular: the members of the RoyalSociety of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, and the “CambridgePlatonists.”The Royal Society was founded in 1660 and granted a formal royal charter in1662. It was the fruit of a gradual maturation of associations amongmodern-minded scientists animated by the spirit of Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis,a utopian novel in which advances in scientific knowledge move in harmony withthe purification of religion and the moral improvement of the human race. As weshall soon see when we consider some of the important roles played byRosicrucianism and Freemasonry in creating the spiritual vocabulary of theEnlightenment, the concept of “the advancement of learning” typically impliedthat the augmentation of scientific knowledge consisted of both material andspiritual aspects. The setting of Bacon’s novel is an imaginary island, the nameof which (Bensalem) means “Son of Peace.” Its central educational institution,Solomon’s House, invokes a proto-Masonic concept of wisdom.A predecessor of the Royal Society had been called the “Invisible College,”where the word “Invisible” bore the general force of the contemporary cybernetic“virtual.” It was not a college of stone and mortar, matriculations andgraduations, but a sociable intellectual community like the later “Republic ofLetters.”From the start, one of the hallmarks of the Royal Society had been its passionfor scientific experiments and the experimental sensibility. It immediatelybecame prominent and also controversial. One of its founders and mostinfluential members was the chemist Robert Boyle, the Boyle of Boyle’s Lawconcerning the relationship between volume and pressure in contained gases.Boyle plays an important role in the history of Greatrakes the Stroker.If the members of the Royal Society consisted of the cutting edge of Britishscience in the period of the Restoration, the so-called Cambridge Platonistsaspired to be the cutting edge among humanists. They were an informal group ofmen who took their name from the fact that most of them were prominent inCambridge University and most of them were knowledgeable about and admiring ofancient Greek idealist philosophy. The two most important were Ralph Cudworth,author of The True Intellectual System of the Universe, and Henry More, a majorAnglican theologian and an impressive philosopher. These men rejected the aridchop-logic of the old Scholastic thinking with the humanistic vigor of Erasmusand Rabelais, if not quite their wit. They kept up with the latest developmentsin British and Continental philosophy alike, reading Descartes and Spinoza aswell as Hobbes and Bacon. Naturally they were interested in the Royal Society,with whose members they had many intellectual and personal connections.The intermediary through whom Greatrakes would come into intimate commerce withthe greatest names in British secular and sacred science was an enlightenedEnglish nobleman named Edward Conway. In the 1660s, not yet come into hisearldom, he was a wealthy landed aristocrat notable for his many amateurintellectual and cultural accomplishments and connections. Lord Conway was atrue patron of learning. Not infrequently he opened his house to the adepts ofthe “new learning,” and the “virtuosi” of the new society. His seat was atRagley Hall, a great house set in the Warwickshire countryside a few miles westof Stratford-on-Avon, and no very great distance from the dreaming spires ofOxford University. Conway’s private library was among the largest in England,and also among the most “modern.” He had a book agent charged with keepingabreast of European erudition.Conway was an important man. Beyond that the historical record suggests that hewas a thoroughly decent and admirable man, a corollary that did not inevitablyaccompany importance among the British aristocracy. Even so, he claims a placein this history primarily by marriage. His beloved wife Anne was trulyremarkable.Lady Anne Conway was born in 1631 and died in 1679. She was the posthumousdaughter of Sir Heneage Finch, at one time the Speaker of the House of Commons.It is perhaps relevant to her later remarkable achievements that the Finchfamily included several learned and independent-minded men interested in strangereligious speculations. For example, her uncle, Sir Henry, was an erudite juristwhose intellectual eccentricities included the writing of a scandalous work ofChristian Zionism (The World’s Great Restoration), for which he was brieflyimprisoned. His prediction of the imminent restoration of a temporal empire ofthe Jews, whether or not such a development might seem necessary to theologiansof history, had rather offended King James.In an age in which the intellectual subordination of women was as a law of thePersians and the Medes, when women were neither expected to be well educated noroffered serious opportunities for intellectual self-improvement, at a time whenthere were no women at all in the universities, in the clergy, or in the“learned” professions, Lady Anne Conway became a savant and a philosopher whoseabilities were publicly recognized by some of the great minds of her time—maleminds, of course. Despite the fact that her sex barred her from the halls andcloisters of Academe, she became by correspondence the special and prized pupilof Henry More, the most renowned theologian and philosopher in the faculties ofCambridge University. Her brother, who had studied under More in a moreconventional setting, had introduced his master to his sister. The history ofAnne Conway’s triumphs happily allows us to applaud the uncommon liberality ofboth those men, no less than that of her husband. It is obvious, given thesocial realities of the period, that Edward Conway at the very least toleratedand almost certainly encouraged his wife’s career as an intellectualadventuress.The tender marital love of Lord and Lady Conway is illustrated by a real-lifemacabre episode worthy of the poetic imagination of an Ovid or a Chrétien deTroyes. The viscount possessed important properties in County Antrim in Ireland,and he was absent on business there when Anne’s illness took a fatal turn andshe died. He had lived in fear of losing her for most of his married life, andhe appears to have left instructions with the live-in Rosicrucian physicianFrancis Mercury van Helmont. Helmont had prepared a special leakproof casket inwhich he could preserve the woman’s body in a clear liquid spirit. There was aglass window on its top just above the place where the corpse’s head would rest,so that upon his return the grieving husband was able to gaze for a final timeupon the face of his beloved.Though Greatrakes was to encounter Lady Conway for medical treatment rather thanfor philosophical discussion, several factors of her intellectual physiognomyare relevant to the history of their association. Eamon Duffy, a prominentecclesiastical historian who has written brilliantly about the Greatrakesepisode, points out one of the curious implications of the Anglican via media inthe Restoration period. The extremes between which the “middle way” was thoughtto pick its safe and sensible path were the twin enthusiasms of Catholicism onthe one hand and radical Dissent on the other. The Roman Catholics believed inthe living continuity of a miraculous tradition. The able Jesuitcontroversialist Robert Bellarmine had pointed to the continuity of miracles asa badge of divine approbation. Even among Protestants, writes Duffy, “Therelentless reduction of the supernatural in Christianity in favour of ‘goodmorality’ was not unresisted.” Many of the more radical sects believed in faithhealing. In particular the Quakers did so: George Fox, the Quaker founder, notinfrequently healed people.The surprising conclusion of Anne Conway’s lifelong spiritual quest was herembrace of Quakerism. Surprising is one word; scandalous would be another. Herold mentor and friend Henry More was horrified, and he no doubt wasrepresentative of most people in their shared circles. But there was more thanone path that might lead to Platonic “transcendence.” Anne Conway had masteredthe learned tongues. She knew Greek in great depth, and she knew enough Hebrewto handle the learned Scriptural exegesis of the university theologians. Herstudies with More, which included wide readings in Plato and Plotinus, wouldhave inevitably led her to ancient esotericism, even had she not included PhiloJudaeus as a “special topics” author. But she did read Philo, and read him withfascination.Here if not before she became interested in classical and modern kabbala,gematria, and other occult features of the old Christian exegesis of theScriptures. The early parts of the Kabbala denudata of Christian Knorr vonRosenroth, a serious Hebraist who had concluded that the three highest circlesof the sephiroth were actually the three persons of the Holy Trinity, appearednear the end of her life. Only the most erudite dared open their pages; shedevoured them with enthusiasm. It is possible, though uncertain, that she mayeven have met Rosenroth during the period of his scholarly wanderings inBritain.She was in daily contact for many years with the aforementioned familyphysician, Francis Mercury van Helmont, who became her close friend as well asher doctor. The career of this important man has been considerably illuminatedin a recent study by Allison Coudert. He was a good friend of Knorr vonRosenroth, and an avid kabbalist himself. Like many linguists of his time he wasobsessed with the idea of the “original language,” and with the supposed specialproperties of Hebrew and the Hebrew alphabet. He was rightly regarded by hisenlightened colleagues as a kind of hero of science, for he had fallen into theclutches of the Inquisition in Italy and emerged from its torments alive andwith his intellectual honor intact. If it seems odd to you that a Dutchmanshould be named “Mercury,” you may be on the right track. Helmont’s father was a“iatrochemist” noted in his day, iatrochemistry (the “higher” chemistry) being,so to speak, the medical side of alchemy, or medicine along the Paracelsanmodel. The word has disappeared. We now have “chemotherapy.” Quite apart fromthe exalted role of mercury in the alchemical universe, the liquid metal was acommon medical “specific” down through the eighteenth century. One of the greatmedical adventurers of that age, Thomas Dover, reveled in the name “DoctorQuicksilver.” He was much in demand. Mercury could be an effective remedy forsyphilis, provided that it did not kill the patient first. But of course thesame could be said of other forms of chemotherapy. Helmont was an occultist anda kabbalist and, like Anne Conway herself, much taken with Quaker spirituality.In any event, Lady Conway’s Enlightenment credentials, crowned by occultexpertise, were impeccable.She wrote a good deal, though only one book went through the press. That was aposthumous publication in Latin translation. Modern British philosophers havebeen conspicuous for the verbal economy of the titles of their books and essays,with an apparent preference for the free-standing gerundive: “Becoming,”“Hesitating,” “Beginning or Ending,” that sort of thing. Lady Anne Conway waslimited by no such constraints. The title of her posthumous work is ThePrinciples of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy, Concerning God, Christ,and the Creatures, viz., of Spirit and Matter in General: Whereby May BeResolved All Those Problems or Difficulties, Which Neither by the School, nor byCommon Modern Philosophy, nor by the Cartesian, Hobbesian, or Spinosian Could BeDiscussed. That is its short title.Anne Conway had a serious medical condition: chronic migraine headaches.According to her report, she was never without a headache, though serious andincapacitating attacks of the megrim were only intermittent. The achievement ofher erudition must have required a most courageous spirit as well as brillianceand unrelenting labor. When traditional medicine failed, she submitted tovarious experimental regimes, many of them nasty. On one occasion she traveledto France to consult with some surgeons supposedly expert in curing migraine bytrepanning. In the end, they declined to break into her skull, probably out of asensible caution prompted by her high social station, though according to theDNB “they are said to have made incisions in the jugular arteries.” Such werethe advanced medical techniques of the second half of the seventeenth century.In the summer of 1665 Greatrakes was in Dublin, where he caused a good deal ofstir, as he did everywhere he went. Here he ran into religious opposition. The(Anglican) archbishop of Dublin at this time was Michael Boyle, a stoutProtestant of the modern school. William Edward Hartpole Lecky, the great Irishhistorian of the nineteenth century, somewhere describes the common Toryattitude to the Church of England in the post-Restoration period. The Church’stheology was, in this view, “an admirable auxiliary to the police force” inwhich religion should play as small a part as possible, and ostentatiousreligion no part at all. Archbishop Boyle appears to have exemplified thisschool of thought.He was horrified to discover that a churchman was going about laying his handson sick people and rubbing their ulcerations, praying all the while in a loudand confident voice. He was even more horrified that the objects of theseattentions were in many cases declaring themselves cured by miracle. Heinstituted his own private Protestant Inquisition, which soon revealed to hisyet further discomfort the technicality that in actual fact there was noAnglican canon against performing miracles in the name of Jesus Christ. He wasreduced to charging Greatrakes with practicing medicine without a license. Andas the Protestant Inquisition was much less practiced than its Catholic analoguein colluding with the secular arm, nothing whatsoever happened. Greatrakesgreeted the proceedings with the amused contempt they so richly deserved. Hesimply ignored Archbishop Boyle, though the business about licensed andunlicensed medicine did in a general way adumbrate the contours of thecontroversy still ahead.As the holder of important estates in Ireland requiring frequent attention, LordConway had naturally heard of Greatrakes the Irish wonder-worker. Now he learnedthat he was in Dublin. He wrote to Greatrakes there through a nobleintermediary, asking him to come to Ragley Hall to treat Lady Anne for themegrim. Naturally, all expenses would be handsomely covered. It was verycharacteristic of the diffident Greatrakes that he at first showed no interestin an invitation that could hardly fail to work for his aggrandizement. It ispossible also that his reluctance betrayed a political attitude. He was areformed rebel, but he remained a lay ascetic committed to plain living and highthinking. He did not know Lord and Lady Conway, and he probably had astereotypical notion of the life of a country magnate. The prospect of sumptuousmeals in a stately home in Warwickshire was not in and of itself a powerfulinducement.However, Conway continued to press the invitation, and after several months ofhesitation Greatrakes acceded. He took ship for Bristol in January 1666. Both onshipboard and especially in the English port city itself, eager petitionerssought his ministrations. He effected “many” cures. It is about seventy milesfrom Bristol to Alcester, the town nearest to Ragley Hall. He claims to havebeen solicited “at every milepost.” Perhaps a little awkwardly he arrived atRagley on January 24, a week before the annual solemnities remembering theexecution of Charles Stuart, King and Martyr.All this was being played out, of course, against the backdrop of a hugenational medical disaster. The year 1665–66 was the infamous “Plague Year,”permanently memorialized in Daniel Defoe’s powerful book. The mortality inLondon, especially in the second half of 1665, was appalling. The king and thecourt had retired to the country. Many wealthy burghers had also fled.Valentine Greatrakes was at Ragley Hall for about three weeks. In his ostensiblemission he failed utterly. He could not cure Lady Anne’s headaches, and afterseveral attempts he frankly confessed his defeat. He left no detailed account ofthe efforts. It is in any case difficult to imagine how his usual method ofapplying repeated, hard “strokes” upon the afflicted bodily part could have beenemployed against headache. Neither on this occasion nor on any other did heapologize for his failure. He always prefaced his therapeutic sessions with aclear announcement of failure’s possibility. From the time of first receivingConway’s invitation, he had expressed to Conway’s intermediary, Sir GeorgeRawdon, his inexperience with migraine and his frank doubts that he could cureit. He had come to believe he was a mere vessel of the divine grace, and thatthe success of his cures could not be guaranteed by the intensity of his ownintentions. On the frequent occasions when there was evidence of instantimprovement, he appeared as delighted and grateful as his patients themselves.The relatively high incidence of his failures, the frankness with which heanticipated their possibility, and the equanimity with which he acknowledgedthem after the fact—all these things argued for the man’s sincerity and hishonesty. A charlatan might seek for alibis in some external circumstance oratmospheric detail peculiar to the venue of the therapeutic attempt. Greatrakesnever did. Though they must have been disappointed, neither Lord nor Lady Conwayexpressed any sense of grievance.Besides, the failure was soon overtaken by success. The news that Greatrakes wasat Ragley had brought a dozen or more scrofula victims to the gates of theestate. The loudly reported accounts of his sensational cures in this field soondrowned out further speculation concerning his inability to remove the migrainesof Lady Conway. For a fortnight he went on a virtual medical rampage, dealingwith dozens of importunate sufferers each day. These were mostly, but notexclusively, cases of the King’s evil. All of Greatrakes’s cures remainmysterious, but particularly mysterious are the reports of the instantreparation of serious bodily injury from accidents—broken bones, deeplacerations, crushed and brutalized tissue.While all this was going on in public and in broad daylight, various great menwere at or passing through Ragley. These included Boyle (the chemist, not thearchbishop), Cudworth, George Rust, and Henry More. These men met Greatrakespersonally and, without exception, formed a positive opinion of his candor andcharacter. Several of them witnessed actual episodes of apparently inexplicablesuccessful healing. Rust and More later described the method as very like areligious ceremony. It always involved “the laying on of hands” (to use thebiblical expression) and a set prayer. Greatrakes always invoked the name ofJesus. He prayed: “God Almighty heal thee for His mercy’s sake.” He invariablydeflected attempts to thank him, saying that all thanks were due to God alone.At Ragley Hall, Valentine Greatrakes had entered a cultural world, rare if notunique in all of England, that would guarantee a public and consequential debateconcerning miracles among leading men of science and leading philosophers andtheologians. The subject was uncongenial to them, but its discussion now becameunavoidable. The “Ragley wonders” became the occasion for a pamphlet war thatprovides most of the comparatively rich documentation on which this and allother accounts of Valentine Greatrakes have depended. What Valentine Greatrakeshad actually done remains mysterious after more than three centuries. What hiscontemporaries thought or said he had done is another matter, and to that weshall shortly return, after briefly concluding a survey of his sojourn inEngland in 1666. The nearest big place to Ragley was Worcester. The town fatherssent emissaries to Greatrakes with importunate invitations to visit theirancient town, and in the middle of February he did so, arriving there on or nearhis thirty-seventh birthday. (He had been born on St. Valentine’s Day,accounting for his uncommon given name.) His stay there is not well documented,but once again there were “many” cures.By now, Greatrakes and his marvels were being talked about throughout the landwherever cosmopolitan gossip was to be heard, and especially in the Londoncoffeehouses. The plague having considerably abated, the capital wasreanimating. The king himself, recently returned to the city, had taken aninterest in the news of Greatrakes. The secretary of state, Lord Arlington,wanted him to visit the capital, and sought a way to persuade him. This time theintermediary was Edmund Bury Godfrey, with whom Greatrakes may already have beenin correspondence. Godfrey was a prosperous businessman and one of the heroes ofthe Plague Year, having courageously stayed at his London post (he was a justiceof the peace) throughout. He was later rewarded with a knighthood. Hismysterious violent death in 1678, at the time supposed to be the work of RomanCatholic conspirators, was a kind of distant, jarring echo of the Gunpowder Plotof 1605.Greatrakes accepted and moved on immediately to London, where commodiousquarters had been made ready for him in Lincoln’s Inn. He stayed there untilJune, treating “many scores” of supplicants, always on a scrupulously gratuitousbasis. The Stroker always gave the appearance of an intense application in hisefforts, and several successive “sessions” appeared to leave him exhausted, asfrom heavy manual labor. The results were, as usual, mixed. Some he appeared tocure; others showed no improvement. The number in the former category, however,was sufficiently large to keep his fame alive. What might be called a “commandsurgery” was arranged for the king and the court at Whitehall. On this occasionGreatrakes failed entirely, leaving the monarch with as dim a view ofGreatrakes’s supposed medical powers as he must at least secretly have had ofhis own. The royal skepticism did not long remain private.In June, Greatrakes returned to Ireland, and in September 1666 a good deal ofold London burned to a crisp. So far as I know nobody ever suggested aconnection between the two events, but the Great Fire definitely changed thesubject of conversation. He did make two more visits to England—in 1668 and1672—but they were not the occasions of publicized medical events. Mainly hesimply relapsed into his quiet and comfortable life of rural obscurity. When hisskeptical wife Ruth died, he married a local widow. Valentine Greatrakes, theStroker, died at his estate at Affane on November 29, 1683, at the age offifty-four.III. A Preemptive Defense: Henry StubbeUnder any circumstances the history of Valentine Greatrakes would remain anhistorical curiosity. It became a significant episode in the history ofEnlightenment thought once it was the occasion of debate among the enlightened.And that debate had become inevitable when Greatrakes entered the circle ofpublic intellectual prominence surrounding Lord Conway. One of his first greatpublic champions was Henry Stubbe (1621–1676). Stubbe is one of those minorfigures beloved by intellectual historians because they are so often “morerepresentative” than the major ones. What Stubbe principally represented was the“old science” in confrontation with the “new philosophy”—that is, theexperimental sensibility of the recently founded Royal Society.Stubbe was a meritocrat, of whom the number in seventeenth-century England wasperhaps larger than is sometimes imagined. He overcame early difficulties togain entry to the Westminster School in London, where his precocity as a Greekstudent won him attention, admiration, and eventually a place at Christ Church,Oxford. The republican tendencies of his youth lapsed into an accommodatingroyalism in middle age. Stubbe was a pamphleteer of ability, but his spleneticessays were never favorable to his political career. He was for a time thesublibrarian of the Bodleian, but he was forced out of Oxford at the Restorationand took up the full-time practice of medicine. Good connections procured forhim the possibly sour plum of an appointment as King’s Physician in Jamaica.The literary product of this appointment, which proved to be brief, was apamphlet entitled The Indian Nectar or a Discourse Concerning Chocolata. Uponreturning to England, Stubbe took up the full-time practice of medicine inWarwickshire, centered in Stratford-on-Avon. It was in this connection that hecame to know, and to be befriended by, Lord Conway of Ragley Hall, a man wholoved his nectar.Stubbe’s little book about the Irish wonder-worker is entitled The MiraculousConformist: or, An Account of Severall Marvailous Cures Performed by theStroaking of the Hands of Mr. Valentine Greatarick. It was published in Oxfordby Hall, the University printer, in 1666. It bears the Latin sententia “Oneought not to deny what is manifest because one cannot understand what is hidden[occultum].” His attack on the Royal Society began formally only in 1669, butthe Latin motto adumbrates one of its central attitudes. Are the empiricalclaims of the “new science” comprehensive and global? Is there still room withinthe new “scientific” universe for the supernatural?Here it is necessary to draw attention to the implications of the word“conformist,” as Stubbe himself did in his prefatory letter. It meant thatGreatrakes was a member of the Church of England. “It may seem equitable that Itell you why I call the Gentleman the Miraculous Conformist: many strangereports have and do runne of him; but he is reclaimed from all that isfanatique; and this gift of Healing was bestowed on him, since the Restorationof his Sacred Majesty, and the restitution of the Doctrine and Discipline of theEnglish Church.”There is a certain amount here that may need unpacking. The English Civil Warhad been in equal parts about politics and religion, and politics and religionpackaged in a certain way. Ever since the Elizabethan settlement many Anglicansregarded the Church as a via media between two destructive extremes, identifiedby Duffy as unreformed Roman Catholicism on the one hand and on the other theradical Protestants called Dissenters or Nonconformists. Both of these groupswere often characterized by Anglicans as fanatic—meaning utterly andunreasonably unyielding in their loyalty to extravagant belief and practice. Asfor the Nonconformists, what they were in dissent against and refused to conformto was the Anglican polity of Church governance: episcopacy. Charles I, nowcalled Charles the Martyr in the Anglican Church, was primarily a martyr toepiscopal polity, which even under extreme duress he would not abandon in favorof the Presbyterianism demanded by the radicals. Needless to say, there was thepolitical dimension famously captured in a statement made by his father, JamesI: “No bishop, no king!” The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 had been alsothe ratification of the Anglican episcopal polity—what Stubbe calls the“Discipline of the English Church.” Those who did not dissent against Anglicanpolity were said to conform to it and, hence, were conformists. Stubbe was oneof those himself, and an affinity of political trajectory perhaps attracted himto Greatrakes.Stubbe’s pamphlet is in the form of a long letter addressed to Robert Boyle,whose fame as a scientist, already very great, would come to rival that of IsaacNewton himself. The printed version contains a brief preface of dedication toThomas Willis, “Doctor of Physique, and Professor of Natural Philosophy inOxford.” Stubbe attempted to forgive the irregularity of such an arrangementwith ponderous wit. “It may seem improper to Dedicate that to one which is sentto another: but whether it be that I am too busy, or too lazy to write more: orthat I manage my friendships with lesse of ceremony and formality than usual, Ihave resolved upon this course.” It was after all a course that bagged two birdswith a single stone, or in this instance two famous natural philosophers with asingle pamphlet.Stubbe was not a great writer. His baroque rhetorical periods, whichoccasionally seem like travesties of Thomas Browne, are made yet lessprepossessing by an unctuous tone. Nonetheless, his little book is full ofideas. He makes an historical survey of the healing touch from biblical andclassical sources, and brings it down to the contemporary monarchs of Englandand France. “Queen Elizabeth did, for some time, discontinue the Touching forthe Kings Evil, doubting either the Success, or Lawfulnesse of that way ofCuring. But she soon quitted that Fitt of Puritanisme, when the Papists defamedher, as if God had withdrawn from her the gift of Healing in that manner becauseshe had withdrawn herself from the Roman Church.” Here he alludes to a recurrenttheme. The apparent significance of Greatrakes’s cures for Stubbe is that theyare the first known instance of God performing miracles among the Protestants.His view is surprisingly liberal. He doubts not that Catholics and Muslims haveindeed had their miracles. “Undoubtedly God hath permitted all Religions (thoughnot the Protestants, till now) to have their real miracles, that men may learneto trye Miracles by the Truth, and the Truth by Miracles.”Though he knows he is writing to a great man of science, he makes so bold as toattempt various scientific explanations of his own. Since disease can be spreadby contagion, why might it not also be cured by contagion? This may have been acommon speculation among the “Ragley group,” as it had already appeared inMore’s Enthusiasmus Triumphatus (1656): “there may be very well a sanative andhealing contagion, as well as a morbid and venomous.”It was only natural that the reports of the miraculous healings would be greetedwith suspicion by one who had not been present, and Stubbe is concerned todispel all suggestions of chicanery or fraud. He does this partly by relatinghis own empirical observations and partly by repeating the testimony of men moreintimate with the Stroker than he. Stubbe has observed Greatrakes closely. Hewatched his hands closely, and smelled them, assuring himself “that his Handshad no manner of Medicaments upon them.” He noted also that the man washed hishands frequently—a detail reassuring to anyone who had ever seen a scrofulaboil. Here Stubbe himself acted in the experimental spirit of the Royal Society.He is entirely prepared to entertain the possibility of magic, but only toreject it in this instance. “I observed that he used no manner of Charmes orunlawful words; sometimes he Ejaculated a short Prayer before he cured any, andalways, after he had done, he bad them give God the Praise.”Most interesting, perhaps, is his account of the more intimate observations ofGreatrakes’s daily companions. On one occasion Greatrakes came into LordConway’s bedroom. His lordship smelled a pleasant odor, as of a flowery bouquet.He asked the attendant servant “what sweet water he had brought into the room”?(The sanitary arrangements of the Old World, even in the great houses of the onepercent, encouraged the lavish use of what we would today call deodorants.)None, he answered. “Whereupon his Lordship smelled on the hand of Mr.Greatarick, and found the fragrancy to issue thence; and examining his Bosome,he found the like scent there.”An evidence more intimate yet came from George Rust, a member of the RoyalSociety and a friend of the Cambridge Platonists and of Joseph Glanville. Thisman, who had been the rector of the church at Lord Conway’s Irish seat and whowould soon succeed Jeremy Taylor as bishop of Dromore, was among the “naturalphilosophers” attempting to save a small preserve of the supernatural in theirincreasingly scientific universe. He had been present at Ragley duringGreatrakes’s charitable rampage. “Dean Rust observed [Greatrakes’s] Urine tosmell like Violets, though he had eat nothing that might give it that scent.”Here is testimony, perhaps, not to be cross-examined. But we must remember thatthe close examination of urine had been fundamental to medical science sinceancient times. The most conspicuous attribute in the iconography of the medicalsaints Cosmas and Damian (third century) is the jordan, or urine flask.The modern reader may find equally startling Stubbe’s further report. “Sir AmosMeredith who had been his Bedfellow said that in the Night he had observed thelike agreeablenesse of the smell in Mr. Greataricks Body, at some hours.” Here,once again, the history of material culture impinges upon metaphysicalspeculation. In the Old World there were often more travelers than there werehotel beds to accommodate them: a fact attested to with equal force by theopening chapters of the Gospel of Matthew and Moby-Dick.What strikes one from the longer historical perspective is the medievalcharacter of this testimony. For us, the phrase “odor of sanctity” has only ametaphoric meaning, if it has any meaning at all. But the odor of sanctity was areal odor, sweet and floral, and in the old hagiographic texts, whetheremanating from the living or the dead, was among the more common physicalmanifestations of divine spiritual approval. Herbert Thurston in his classicstudy of The Physical Phenomena of Mysticism devotes an entire chapter to theodor of sanctity. “The vast majority of cases have to do with the fragranceproceeding after death from the mortal remains of some of God’s speciallydevoted servants … but there are also many instances of Saints whose person,dress, and cell have diffused sweet odours during life in such a way as toattract the general attention of their intimates and visitors.”Stubbe thus seems to belong to the retrograde school of the “old” science. Yethis championing of Greatrakes, from another point of view, associates him withsome fashionable tendencies of his day. The search for unifying themes oftenleads us to fascinating but somewhat obscure individuals, of the sort normallyclassed among the “minor figures” of their age. One such figure, yet moreobscure than Stubbe himself, is the Londoner Ezekiel Foxcroft, born in 1633,Fellow of King’s College, Cambridge, from 1652 to 1674, the year of his death.Even the laundry lists of great geniuses may be honored by scholarly editions,and among the eagerly studied informal writings of Sir Isaac Newton are theflyleaf doodles and marginal notations to be found in many of the books once inhis private library. One graffito of 1675 is recorded in a book entitled Manna—adisquisition of the nature of alchemy: “This philosophy, both speculative andactive, is not only to be found in the volume of nature, but also in the sacredscriptures, as in Genesis, Job, Psalms, Isaiah and others. In the knowledge ofthis philosophy, God made Solomon the greatest philosopher in the world.” Thebook had been a gift from Newton’s erudite friend Ezekiel Foxcroft.Foxcroft was the very able translator of the first known English version of theGerman Johann Valentin Andreae’s Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosecross. I say“first known” translation because so many works continued to circulate inerudite circles in manuscript form, and especially, perhaps, “esoteric” works.It is probable that Andreae’s book had been known and discussed in England muchearlier. Foxcroft’s translation itself found its way into print only fourteenyears after his death.There is another connection—that with Greatrakes the Stroker. Foxcroft had beenan intimate in the “Ragley group.” He knew Henry More and Ralph Cudworth well.When Henry Stubbe sought to get a “blurb” for his Miraculous Conformist, it wasto Foxcroft that he turned. The lengthy title of Stubbe’s pamphlet ends thus:“With a Letter Relating some other of his Miraculous Cures, attested by E.Foxcroft M.A. and Fellow of Kings Colledge in Cambridge.” But if Greatrakes hadhis public defenders, he no less had public detractors.IV. A Bitter Attack: David LloydThroughout the periods of the Restoration and eighteenth centuries, job printingwas relatively inexpensive in England. For this reason, among others, it was theGolden Age of the Pamphlet. It did not cost very much to get a few of your ideasinto print in a few dozen copies, and this could often be done in an amazinglyshort period of time. It was also the period of the rise of the periodical.Serious legal risk attended certain subjects, but for many others the soleeditorial constraint was the author’s pocketbook. The fact that some few of thebrightest jewels of English literature first appeared as pamphlets still readtoday, while some few others introduced ideas destined for celebrity, mighteasily cause one to forget that much pamphlet literature was dross read bypractically nobody even then. Much of it had a distinctly hurried, temporary,“time-sensitive” character rather like that of our electronic mail. That the“learned” pamphlet by convention required a certain amount of citation in thelearned languages, together with frequently errant or incomprehensible footnotecitation, does not much alter this characterization. The desiderata were speedof writing and speed of delivery.The immediate circumstances of Stubbe’s Miraculous Conformist are not known, butat times it suggests a tone of preemptive defense. He may very well have heardsome of the less complimentary gossip from London. But we are obliged torecognize that Stubbe regarded himself primarily as a scientist defending dataderived from his own empirical observation at Ragley. That there is a fixed ruleconcerning the ratio between volume and pressure in compressed gases was ascientific discovery. That blood circulates through the human body impelled bythe pumping action of the heart was a scientific discovery. So far as Stubbe wasconcerned, it was a scientific discovery that God was now working miraclesthrough Protestants.An anonymous pamphlet attacking Greatrakes is entitled Wonders No Miracles, orMr. Valentine Greatrakes Gift of Healing Examined. This is a work much more inthe older theological mode—remembering always that theologians frequentlyexemplified their materials with “scientific” matter. It dates from the middleof March 1666, as an immediate response to Stubbe’s Miraculous Conformist of amonth earlier.Its author was an eccentric Welsh clergyman named David Lloyd, the hack authorof more than one strange work. The most famous perhaps was a long martyrology ofRoyalist victims of the Civil War, beginning of course with King Charleshimself. According to Anthony à Wood, the book made Lloyd’s reputation as “notonly the character of a most impudent plagiary but a false writer and meerscribbler.” It may have been Greatrakes’s undisguised Roundhead past thatoffended Lloyd’s extravagant Caroline royalism.The haste of its accomplishment is perhaps suggested by a serious error in itstitle page. The immediate occasion for Lloyd’s “examination” of Greatrakes wasan episode on March 7, when according to Lloyd the Stroker very nearly killed aman in Charter-House Yard, in London, with his futile and most untender mercies.This could not have happened in 1665, as the title page asserts, when Greatrakeswas still pondering the breadth of his medical mandate back on his Irish farm.Yet though the organization of Wonders No Miracles is badly confused, the authorpractically assaults his reader with an appearance of a scholastic rigor oforganization. The man has a wonderfully taxonomic mind. He likes to makenumbered lists. He cites classical authority for fifteen causes of thecorruption of the imagination. (It may be corrupted “by windy Meats, and want ofdue Evacuations,” among other things.)Once he has fired off a barrage of gross libels in his opening pages, he rarelysuccumbs to mere personal vituperation, though one easily enough deduces he musthave hated Greatrakes. His concern is not that the Stroker’s supposed miraclesare an insult to science. They are an insult to religion. Greatrakes frequentlyused the word “impulse” when speaking of his inner apprehension of his healinggift. That word is to Lloyd as a red rag is to a bull. Impulses have impelledmost of the great frauds and madmen of history (more detailed lists). Theimpulsive is the very negation of the rational.He accuses Greatrakes of enthusiasm, and derides as dishonest his claim to be a“Latitude-Man,” a Latitudinarian, or Broad Churchman. He was after all formerlyof the rebel party. Enthusiasm was the great fear of the Anglican Establishment.It meant an excessively emotional (“impulsive,” perhaps) investment in religion,indecorous tears, obscene shouts of “Halleluia,” any sort of Holy-Rolling.Enthusiasm was on a par with superstition, of which it was sometimes reckoned asubspecies or a sign. In general, though, Anglicans imputed superstition to theRoman Catholics and enthusiasm to the Protestant sectaries. The charge ofenthusiasm was a predictable one to level against a former Roundhead, and Stubbehad anticipated it with a firm denial.Lloyd’s attack on Greatrakes’s supposed miracles is partly based in observedspecifics, but mainly in a priori general principles. That Greatrakes did notalways succeed, and that some of his supposed successes were at best onlypartial cures, is for Lloyd a sufficient refutation of any claim to themiraculous. Greatrakes himself invariably faced his failures with equanimity. Hehad never claimed to be able to cure all illnesses all the time. Lloyd alsochastises the Stroker for the physical violence of his technique. He speaks notonly of the vigorous manhandling of various bodily parts but of frequent“cutting.” This is the only place in the contemporary literature in which I findsuch an imputation. One doesn’t know quite what to make of it. It seems obviousthat Lloyd himself never personally witnessed one of the sessions. He is relyingon secondary reports, including some probably indignant ones. It is entirelycredible that a severely ill person with badly inflamed sores, limbs, or jointswould experience considerable pain from Greatrakes’s ministrations, and that ifthey did not make him feel better they might well make him feel worse.Mainly, however, Lloyd objects to the miraculous claims on theoretical grounds.He is forced to believe in the miracles recorded in the Bible, but assumes,rather than argues, that any miracle whatsoever must conform to biblical type.Jesus’ miracles had been under discussion for fifteen hundred years.Surprisingly little of the large clerical commentary suggested that Jesus hadhealed the sick out of compassion or to relieve suffering. The two-fold purposeof Jesus’ miracles was generally held to be (1) to demonstrate his divinepowers; and (2) to confirm the authenticity of his religious revelation. So alsowere the underlying purposes of the biblically warranted Apostolic miracles.Greatrakes, who always insisted he was a mere instrument or conduit, claimed nodivine power, let alone any new revelation. Hence the cures, even if authentic,would not be miraculous by Lloyd’s standard.But he is far from believing them to be authentic. One very modern aspect ofWonders No Miracles is the confidence with which he dismissed a large body offirst-person testimony as superstition or delusion. History is replete withdelusions of the grossest sort, and he lists a fair number of them—the man whothought he could live on air alone, the Jew sufficiently convinced of immediateresurrection to kill himself, and so on. He makes one powerful point not alwaysconsidered in the “literature”: the dangerous potential of religious enthusiasmin this particular year. Here he clearly alludes to the Plague of 1666, ageneral catastrophe perhaps capable of infecting even sane minds with delusions.This was, after all, the year of the millennium plus the number of the Beast(1,000 + 666). And although Lloyd heaps scorn upon the popular apocalypticism ofthe enthusiasts, his own framework is in fact apocalyptic. Greatrakes is yetanother of the false prophets of the last days.V. Greatrakes Strikes BackIn April 1666, Greatrakes met Robert Boyle in London. They were very nearcontemporaries and in childhood had been very near neighbors. The distancebetween Lismore Castle, where Boyle was born on January 25, 1627, and Affanemanor house, where Greatrakes was born on February 14, 1628, is perhaps sixmiles. As Greatrakes points out, he had his early education in the free schoolof Lismore, which had been established by Boyle’s grandfather. In the sixteenthand seventeenth centuries England had pursued a policy of “Plantation”—theencouragement of large-scale Protestant emigration from England and Scotland toconfiscated lands in Ireland. The two families were members of the Plantationcolonists, of “Scotch Irish,” as they are sometimes called, a group from whichderived an astonishing number of Nature’s aristocrats, including severalpresidents of the United States. Both men were more conventional aristocrats aswell, though Boyle of a degree considerably higher than Greatrakes. Greatrakeswould certainly have been aware of the recent publication of Wonders No Miraclesat the time of their meeting; and Boyle, too, may have been. It was undoubtedlywith the prior permission of the recipient that the Stroker structured hisautobiographical rebuttal in the form of a letter to Boyle.It is called A Brief Account of Mr. Valentine Greatraks, and Divers of theStrange Cures by Him Lately Performed, and it was licensed on May 10, 1666,shortly before Greatrakes returned to Ireland. It crackles with outrage.Greatrakes was pretty sure who the author of Wonders No Miracles was—namely, theconvicted libelist of The Countess of Bridgewater’s Ghost, which had cost Lloydsix months in the clink—but he simply treats him as an anonymous scoundrelmotivated by an unexplained malice. He begins by denying, vehemently, a numberof Lloyd’s untruths that had particularly stung him. First he never told thebishop of Chichester that he had heard the voice of God speaking to him from theheavens. He includes a letter from His Grace testifying to the fact thatGreatrakes told him no such thing. Secondly, he places upon the record a letterfrom Mr. Cresset, proprietor of the house in Charter-House Yard where Greatrakesis supposed to have carried out some of his worst depradations, to the effectthat Mr. Greatrakes did not at that time and place utter a blasphemous oath,taking the name of the Lord in vain. Next the anonymous author of No Miracleshad charged that although the pretended healer never actually charged for hisservices, he did borrow money from his patients. Greatrakes was that kind ofProtestant who thinks that debt is probably more criminal than theft. He hadnever borrowed a farthing in his life! A second point of particular pique isthat the author of Wonders No Miracles had called him a “Good Fellow”—a phrasemeaning something along the spectrum between “good ole boy” and “goodfella,” anold drinking buddy with possibly criminal tendencies. Greatrakes is emphaticconcerning his moderation in food and drink. As for “having to do with women,”there has been in his whole lifetime only the skeptical Ruth.Having relieved himself of a certain weight of righteous indignation, Greatrakessettles into a more conventional autobiographical mode, giving Boyle aneconomical but detailed sketch of his life and, in particular, of that part ofit having to do with his religious views in relation to his stroking activities.It is a dignified document, and I regard it as credible and veracious. It mustbe pointed out, however, that almost everything that has appeared in print aboutthe life of Greatrakes derives from his own authority alone.He himself was conscious of the potential difficulty. That is why he concludedit with a lengthy dossier of testimonials written by friends, acquaintances, andformer patients. The aggregate effect of these documents is most impressive.Among his witnesses is Andrew Marvell, poet and prominent politician, and thephilosopher Ralph Cudworth. Benjamin Whitecote, the provost of King’s College,Cambridge, and famous preacher of the time, was actually one of his patients andgives his affidavit of miraculous healing. There are several others.Furthermore, from this testimony and from that of all others made by people whoactually knew him, such as Lord and Lady Conway, one gets the picture of a kind,sincere, level-headed, socially “normal” sort of a fellow. Many commentatorsseem to be as admiring of the eleemosynary nature of his medical practice as ofits inexplicable efficacy.Robert Boyle himself was perhaps one of those. He was cautious, and he waspuzzled. We have some of his autograph notes in which he began a first attemptto account for the apparently “miraculous” phenomena in scientific andmaterialistic terms. But he did not get very far, and apparently dropped thematter, as Greatrakes himself appears to have done. Miracles that were anembarrassment to the bishops of the Church of Ireland and the members of theRoyal Society alike were probably, after all, better left unmentioned.BibliographicalThe only recent monograph study of Greatrakes the Stroker known to me is LeonardPitt, A Small Moment of Great Illumination: Searching for Valentine Greatrakes,the Master Healer (Emeryville, CA, 2006). This is a rather slight work, but itdoes have an extensive bibliography. Most of the relevant primary sources arenow available in print-on-demand format or on the Internet. These include HenryStubbe’s The Miraculous Conformist (1666), David Lloyd’s anonymously publishedWonders No Miracles (1666), and Greatrakes’s own Brief Account (1666).The most important contribution to historical analysis is the scholarly essay byEamon Duffy, “Valentine Greatrakes, the Irish Stroker: Miracle, Science, andOrthodoxy in Restoration England,” in Religion and Humanism, Papers Read at theEighteenth Summer Meeting and the Nineteenth Winter Meeting of theEcclesiastical History Society, edited by Keith Robbins (Oxford, 1981), pp.251–72.

This imaginary scene of the saint in private prayerderives from a familiar medieval stereotype of St. Jerome. The image wasproduced by an artist of some reputation, Jean Restout, for inclusion in theinfluential apologetic book by magistrate Louis-Basile Carré de Montgeron, LaVérité des Miracles (1737). Carré de Montgeron, having come to Saint-Médard toscoff, remained to pray.2 The Convulsionists [../Text/content.xhtml#ch2]IN THE WEE HOURS of a morning at the end of January in the year 1732, there wasa dramatic police raid on the church of Saint-Médard in Paris. The church is nolonger there, but tourists who have taken in the street market in the rueMouffetard have been very near its former site. Large numbers of Louis XV’sfinest were present, including the chief of the Metropolitan Police himself.Many were on their expertly trained combat horses, weapons gleaming in theirhands. It must have looked like an elite special ops force tasked with capturinga well-defended redoubt. Yet both the church itself and its small contiguousgraveyard were silent and empty in the cold winter dawn. The actual task of thepolice commandos was to chain shut the gates of the Saint-Médard churchyard andto affix upon them a sign announcing that, by order of the king himself, entryto the cemetery was strictly forbidden.Such a show of force might have seemed disproportionate to the threat addressed:the long dead bones of one of the occupants of the small graveyard. Theauthorities, however, had their reasons. That skeleton had proved to be at leastas lively as the one encountered by Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones, and hadproved a cause of serious civil disturbance and a potential threat to altar andthrone alike. Sometime the following morning a satirical wit added his ownversion of the royal “No Trespassing” sign in the form of the following distych:De par le Roi, Défense à DieuDe faire miracle en ce lieu.This might be roughly translated as follows:By order of the King: God may notPerform any miracles on this spot!Such was the first of many contributions to what would in time become the richliterature devoted to the odd doings at Saint-Médard Church, usually called “theAffair of the Convulsionists.”Men and women sometimes act upon the basis of ideas and convictions that, whilesufficiently clear and compelling to themselves, cannot be grasped intelligentlyeven by their contemporary adversaries. In the long view of history it oftenoccurs that little more is remembered of their motives than that they lost. Anyhonest attempt to understand the Convulsionists of Saint-Médard requires atleast a momentary consideration of certain “background” matters of which many ofthe Convulsionists themselves would have been innocent. The essential backgroundfor the episode of Parisian Convulsionism begins with the contest between theJesuits and the Jansenists. The Jesuits define a major topic in the history ofmodern Roman Catholicism, the Jansenists a kind of historical blip. But that isa judgment of the long run. We must try to reimagine things from the perspectiveof the seventeenth century.I. The JesuitsJesuits are members of the Society of Jesus, a religious order founded in 1534by an old soldier, Ignatius of Loyola, and a few of his friends. By 1540 it hadalready “caught on,” and had gained papal approbation. Specific features of thefounder’s biography combined with major historical developments in westernEurope to define the nature and mission of the new religious order. From hismilitary background Ignatius had taken not merely a vocation of militancy but astrong sense of discipline and the chain of command. The metaphor of religiouslife as “warfare” was a hoary one, and there were already a number of orders ofactual military monks dating from the time of the medieval Crusades. Even so,the military structure of the Society of Jesus was of novel conception. TheJesuits thought of themselves as the shock troops of the Church. They were theSociety of Jesus, but their supreme earthly commander was the “Vicar of Christ,”the Pope.Two particular historical stimuli animated Jesuit activity. The first was theProtestant Reformation. What was seen as a divinely inspired achievement by theReformers was to the old Catholic hierarchy and its political adherents aprodigious disaster. The Jesuits were genuine reformers, but their Reformationwould be carried out within the Church. They would be the spearhead of aCounter-Reformation. But of course Counter-Reformation, no less than Reformationitself, implies change. The question was: would the change be restoration orinnovation? The first might be good, but the latter, especially in the contextof an intrinsically conservative religious institution, was necessarily bad. Inbreaking with Rome, Luther, Calvin, and the others had, in the opinion of theCounter-Reformers, thrown out the baby with the bathwater. They themselves wouldget rid of the scum, but keep the babe.This part of the Jesuit vocation might be described as a kind of spiritualdamage control. It manifested itself in a remarkable intellectual efflorescencethat redefined for several centuries such fundamental cultural phenomena as theshape of Christian education and the shape of lay piety. A second strand, noless decisive, was evangelical and missionary. Less than half a century hadpassed since Columbus had completed his first voyage to the New World. Columbushad discovered the West by mistake. Before the fifteenth century was out Vascoda Gama had discovered the East on purpose. The vision of vast new lands, manyof them as rich in souls as in spices or precious metals, now captured theEuropean consciousness. The theory developed among Catholic providentialiststhat there was a connection between the newly lost Protestants and the newlyfound pagans of the Americas and Asia. On the great exchequer of history theJesuits would replenish the Church’s spiritual balance through missionaryactivity.The distinction between restoration and innovation, though prominent in thepolemics of the Reformation period, is a subtle one that may baffle thehistorian. In all social institutions we shall find a commerce betweencontinuity and change, ebb and flow. Religious difference is much less aboutbelief than often meets the eye. At issue between Jansenists and Jesuits werecertain doctrines concerning divine grace that proved, for some of them,literally worth dying for. But the conflict between Jesuits and Jansenists wasabout much more than academic theology. The Jansensists were not members of aparticular religious order, but a coalition of like-minded theologicalconservatives who shared many traditional beliefs concerning the proper natureof religious life. Shared attitudes made of them a quasi-order, and one canspeak of a Jansenist style, just as one can speak of a Benedictine or aFranciscan style. In truth, there is abundant evidence in the history ofChristianity to demonstrate that there are fashions and styles of spiritual lifejust as there are fashions and styles of painting or of architecture. Thestylistic element in the battle between Jesuits and Jansenists should not beminimized.images [../Images/p77.jpg]The journal Nouvelles ecclésiastiques (Church News), which catered to theJansenist clergy and their concerns about the papal bull Unigenitus Dei Filius,widely proclaimed and defended the miracles at the shrine of the Deacon Pâris atSaint-Médard Church. This etched vignette (1738) suggests the futility of theroyal persecution of the true believers. A pious youth stands reading in thecourtyard of a Bastille-like prison: “Whether free or a prisoner, he is thetriumphant demonstration of the truth of the miracles.”Everything about the Jesuit style was “modern.” The military metaphor might havebeen hoary with age, but the “army” upon which the Society of Jesus was modeledwas not that of St. Louis but that of the emperor Charles V, an army ofgunpowder rather than arrowheads. The phrase “the religious life” is likely tocall to mind an image of a monk laboring tediously with stylus and parchment athis inclined desk in a cold scriptorium. The Jesuits were par excellence theorder of the new printing press. Their prodigious learning was on a scale ofwhich the Middle Ages had been technologically incapable; their prodigiousliterary production was the new Renaissance learning of print culture.That the early Jesuits should find themselves in conflict with the Churchconservatives of their day should not upon reflection surprise us. The historyof institutional Christianity is a history of tension between a supposedly fixedand unchanging body of doctrine and practice and the irresistible innovationsbrought about by political, social, and material change. There is a clearmedieval parallel to the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century contest betweenJesuits and Jansenists in the conflict between the secular clergy (the parishpriests “in the field,” so to speak) and the members of the new mendicantorders, the Franciscan and Dominican friars, in the thirteenth and fourteenthcenturies. Since like the Jesuits the friars “won,” we have long forgotten thatin their early centuries many considered them the practitioners of dangerous andinadmissible innovations.These strands came together dramatically at the Council of Trent (1545–63), theworkshop of the Counter-Reformation. In this reforming council the members ofthe new Society of Jesus played prominent roles, and from it the Jesuits emergedwith considerably augmented prestige and reputation. Among the actions of theCouncil of Trent was the formal adoption of Thomist Scholasticism as the“official” theology of the Church. The Jesuits, who would increasingly dominatethe theology faculties of Catholic Europe over the next several decades, becamethe prominent proponents of an updated Scholasticism. They became, in short, thefriars of the new age.II. JansenismBy and large, Newton’s third law applies to the exertions of religiousreformers: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. There was aProtestant Reformation. In reaction to it there occurred within the Roman Churchwhat is called the Counter-Reformation. As we have just seen, a prominentfeature of the Counter-Reformation was the extraordinary efflorescence of thenewly founded Society of Jesus, whose members, for a time, seemed destined tocommand a near monopoly on the intellectual and moral lives of Catholicism. Butno conservatism, perhaps, is more rigid than religious conservatism. Forreligious conservatives, changes that may seem insignificant in the eyes of thedistant historical observer may take on all the weight of a causus belli. Thelarge and consequential schism of the Old Believers within the Russian OrthodoxChurch was triggered in part by an orthographic adjustment to the spelling ofthe name of Jesus in the Bible. Thus it was that the Counter-Reformation itselfwas countered in various ways by men ever wary of the powers of discernment ofall reformers and revolutionaries to distinguish between the dirty bathwater andthe baby within it.Jansenism takes its name from a seventeenth-century theologian, Cornelius OttoJansen (1585–1638)—often called Jansen the Younger, to distinguish him from alike-named ecclesiastical uncle. The Jansenists themselves did not of coursespeak of “Jansenism.” Most isms are pejorative, and Jansenism is no exception.It was a term used by others who believed it to be a heresy. Of course anyonewho has spent much time studying the development of Christian doctrine is likelyto adopt a certain wit’s definition of heresy: “Heresy is the side that loses.”By this definition, if no other, Jansenism was a heresy. Young Jansen wasbrilliant, pious, indefatigably studious, and of a gloomy frame of mind. He byno means approved of all the tendencies of Counter-Reform. In particular heviewed with alarm and distaste the modes of neo-Scholastic philosophy nowfashionable in the Faculty of Theology and much in vogue among the Jesuits.So thorough was the subsequent triumph of Scholasticism that today it isdifficult to realize that there was nothing novel in Jansen’s attitude, thatindeed he was in many ways a typical theological conservative. There had beenvigorous opposition to the Schoolmen of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,who had taken it as their task to “reconcile” so far as was possible biblicalspirituality and Aristotelian moral philosophy. According to a conservativecritic of that age, “All true divinity has yielded to sophistry, and Paul toAristotle.” But the Scholastic method of the great thirteenth-century Dominicantheologian Thomas Aquinas (“Thomism”) had received the official approbation ofthe Church in conclave at the reforming Council of Trent.Together with a like-minded friend, Jean Du Vergier de Hauranne (aka the abbé deSaint-Cyran, or simply Saint-Cyran), with whom he for several years shared anintimate friendship based in strict ascetic practice and shared intellectualaffinity, Jansen conducted an intense program of reading in the Fathers of theChurch, and particularly in Augustine. The two friends greatly preferred the oldbiblically oriented patristic theology to what they considered the sterileprocedures of the Scholastic academics. They studied Augustine with an almostpreternatural intensity. They were men who knew their Augustine. CorneliusJansen read through the doctor’s complete works, which are vast, ten times intheir entirety. The polemical works dealing with the theological questions thatmost troubled him he read thirty times.Those questions had to do with reconciling divine grace—that is, the help orfavor afforded to men and women directly by God—with the possibilities andlimitations of human moral merit, and with the nature of God’s justice. Thesequestions had of course been prominent in the minds of the Protestant reformers,including the two most important ones, Martin Luther and John Calvin. Both menwere considerable Augustinians. Luther had actually been a brother of the Orderof the Hermits of St. Augustine. So close are Augustine’s and Calvin’s teachingson grace that some scholars have spoken of “Augustinianism” and “Calvinism”almost interchangeably.The Protestant critique of the late medieval Church was that it had become amachine that promised salvation by mechanical means. Sinful human nature meantthat everyone was a debtor, but there were ways to pay off the debt, or at leastto cancel it, through penance. Various penitential good works, asceticdisciplines, private devotions, pilgrimages—all these things were “meritorious.”It was also possible, through good works, to effect merit vicariously, on thebehalf of others, such as a dead parent or spouse. Finally, it might be possibleto make withdrawals from the great treasury of merit built up by the saints, andespecially by the Blessed Virgin. Among the most charming miracle stories oflate medieval popular literature is the well-known tale of the “Jongleur deNotre Dame.” A jongleur (juggler, common street musician, a practitioner of anofficially despised profession) is to be hanged for crimes committed. He has leda conspicuously reprobate life, his sole act of piety being his unfailing habitof saying a daily Ave to the Virgin. That proves to be enough, for when thesupport is removed from beneath his feet, the Virgin herself reaches out herhand to uphold the falling body and frustrate the lethal work of gravity. Sogreat a grace might so little meritorious action gain.The Church never said that one could buy forgiveness of sins with money. Youmight, however, buy a piece of paper declaring that sins had been forgiven orwere in a state of progressive remission. That is what an indulgence was. Someminds considered that a distinction without a difference. Everyone knows that aprecipitating event in Luther’s career was the preaching of the Dominicanpardoner John Tetzel.Jansen was an academic theologian, a scholar. From one perspective, he wassimply working in the well-established Augustinian tradition of the theologyfaculty at Louvain. Saint-Cyran, on the other hand, clearly was interested incurrent topics of ecclesiology, and especially in what he regarded as somedangerous novelties introduced by the Counter-Reformers at the Council of Trent.In particular he developed a studied hostility to the Jesuits, the mostconspicuous champions of “cheap grace.” In order to justify the ways of God toman, John Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Though reading it has seemed to many astudent a heavy burden, it is as child’s play to the work produced from the samemotive a couple of decades earlier by Cornelius Jansen. Jansen’s book was calledAugustinus, the Latin form of the name of St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430), thegreatest and most influential of the Fathers of the Church.I said earlier that Jansen and Saint-Cyran knew their Augustine. There wereother Augustines to be known. It is perhaps to be regretted that one of thegreatest thinkers—and writers—the world has ever known so often felt himselfconstrained to write in a polemical, sometimes violently polemical style. Thatis because he was forever writing against “heretics.” He knew the power of falseideas personally, and he had for a time embraced the gross dualism of theManichaeans. In Augustine, anti-heretical polemic sometimes clouds over thesunny sky of an attractive teaching. Many people know that Augustine said, “LoveGod, and do as you please.” Fewer know the context: a license to do as onepleases in the extirpation of the Donatist heresy.IT IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT to know what ancient heretics actually taught.Usually the authentic writings have long since been destroyed. We know of themonly what their enemies have written about them, often with considerablerhetorical exaggeration. But we can be pretty sure about Pelagianism, thedoctrine of Pelagius, a “British Sicilian” contemporary with Augustine. Pelagiuswas the spokesman for a group of aristocratic Roman ascetics whose model (intheir own eyes) was St. Jerome. He taught that it was possible for men,exercising their own free will, to take the first steps toward their ownsalvation. It was a doctrine actually developed in defense of ascetic life, butit seemed to Augustine to deny the abjectly fallen nature of the humancondition. If a man could, without divine initiative, take a step towardsalvation, did that not question the absolute character of divine justice?On the whole Augustine was decidedly against heresy, but he did have one goodword to say for it. Wrong ideas powerfully or persuasively expressed had thevirtue of requiring for their effective refutation the deepest possible thoughtfrom their Catholic opponents. The ideas of Pelagius were not merely well put;they were also sympathetic and attractive. For this reason they reappeared, inone form or another, in various moments of Church history as the irritant grainsof sand which goaded the orthodox to the fabrication of their theologicalpearls. One famous episode came in the middle of the fourteenth century whenThomas Bradwardine, later an archbishop of Canterbury, wrote in nine hundredpages a kind of early draft of the Augustinus entitled De causa Dei contraPelagianos (In Favor of God Against the Pelagians). Bradwardine’s Victorianbiographer, Walter Farquar Hook, put it thus: “These abstruse subjects presentthemselves, from time to time, for discussion in the Church, being designed,probably, by Divine Providence to interest the minds of men, by compelling themto stretch out their necks, as it were, that, if it be possible, they may lookover the ramparts, which separate eternity from time.”From the irresistible logic of such doctrines as the total depravity of mankindand the unquestionable justice of God flowed various alarming conclusions suchas, for example, the equable insistence that unbaptized babes might sizzleeternally in hell, and do so justly. To return to the admirable Dean Hook: “Manyminds have, in all ages, found it difficult to reject Augustinianism, or, as itwas subsequently called, Calvinism; for it is against the conclusions that theyhave revolted, while by the process of argumentation through which theconclusions have been reached, they have been fascinated.”THE TRAGEDY OF JANSENISM, as several historians have called it, naturallyinvolved much more than ideas in conflict. It will forever be linked as wellwith certain personalities and places. In addition to those already named, aParisian family named Arnauld played a leading role. Antoine (“the Great”)Arnauld (1612–1694) was the most prominent of Jansenist apologetic theologians.His voluminous writings range from highly subtle technical theology to popularspirituality of wide influence. His masterpiece in the latter genre was a bookabout the frequency with which a Christian should receive the Eucharist. Hisview was that it should be done infrequently, and only after the most scrupulousself-examination. If one can imagine a world in which such a book could become abest seller among a still fairly small reading public, one has made a giant steptoward understanding the Age of Enlightenment.The Great Arnauld had an elder sister, Jacqueline-Marie-Angélique Arnauld(1591–1661, known to history as “Mère Angélique”), who was a kind of spiritualdynamo. In the old Catholic world the religious life was, for many, andespecially for many women, as much a social choice as a spiritual vocation. Manynunneries had the social selectivity of an exclusive country club. They oftenrequired dowries, and a family would “settle” a superfluous or inconvenientdaughter in a “good house.” Life within such houses might be notably unrigorous.The Italian novelists of the fourteenth century, who made the scandalous nun apermanently current type in European literature, were doubtless exaggerating;but the “society nun” was a reality. An epistolary novel in the form of thesupposed love letters of a Portuguese nun was one of the great European literarysuccesses of the late seventeenth century.Angélique was “pre-enrolled” into religion at the age of seven. At the age often she found herself the prepubescent “mother superior” of a quite laid-backsociety of Cistercian nuns at an old convent in the marshes near Paris, calledPort-Royal, or Port-Royal des Champs—Port-Royal in the Fields. A few years latera friar’s sermon triggered in her a dramatic religious conversion. Religioushistory is replete with examples of nominally religious people who are madeactually religious by contemplating their responsibilities in a new light. Thesituation often becomes sticky, as it did, for example, when Thomas à Becketdeveloped a set of archiepiscopal expectations rather different from those ofthe king who had sponsored him. Many of the Port-Royal nuns, accustomed by tacitcontract to a relaxed mode of monasticism, caused difficulties for the suddenlyzealous superior. She persisted, however, and Port-Royal, reformed under herinspiration along strict ascetic lines, became a renowned center of spiritualitythat acted like a magnet for those who thirsted for the beauty of holiness.Expanded in numbers, it had to move to larger quarters in Paris (also calledPort-Royal), but the old rural house remained, destined to become the center ofseventeenth-century Jansenism, insofar as ideas have centers. A motto of theancient Egyptian hermits who in large numbers had taken refuge in the wilds ofthe Thebaid was “the desert a city.” The old medieval nunnery “in the fields”continued in that spirit, becoming the host of a kind of permanent religiousretreat in which distinguished “solitaries” (hermits) took up residence. Otherspiritual-minded lay people, many of some social distinction, bought or rentedproperty near the abbey in order to be close to its spiritual power.The story of Port-Royal as magisterially narrated by Sainte-Beuve is one of themasterpieces of nineteenth-century French literature. The place has many otherliterary connections. It was there that the Great Arnauld and others producedthe famous Logic and Grammar called “Port-Royal,” which to this day arerecognized as important contributions to philosophy and linguistic theory.Blaise Pascal, though he never took up life as an anchorite at Port-Royal, was adevoted fellow traveler. His famous Provincial Letters are undoubtedly the mostfamous piece of Jansenist literature ever produced. They take their name fromthe fiction that they are letters directed to the Provincial, the title given bythe Jesuits to the head of one of the order’s provinces. They are actually awickedly witty satire on Jesuit moral theology as represented in some of thefamous “manuals.” Pascal’s sister became a professed nun at Port-Royal. JeanRacine, one of the greatest of French dramatists, was among the select alumni ofthe Port-Royal grammar school. He struggled for much of his life to reconcileits ascetic principles with the worldly values of a man of the theater. After aperiod of apostasy he returned to the spiritual fold, becoming the historian ofthe institution.The reader will need an introduction to one more ecclesiastical character:Pasquier Quesnel. Quesnel, another arch-conservative of strict ascetic habits,was the great vernacular popularizer of Jansenism. He prepared a French-languageedition of the New Testament, elaborately annotated with what he called “moralreflections.” (In the last quarter of the seventeenth century it enjoyed anextraordinary popularity in many subsequent editions, often under the titleRéflexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament.) In terms of popular religiousliterature designed for the laity, it was the age of manuals (literallyhandbooks), often prepared by Jesuit authors, that presented doctrine in acut-and-dried Scholastic fashion and approached the religious life by means ofcodified systems and practices. Quesnel was an old-fashioned Augustinian exegetewho advocated the closest possible reading of the text, in which he typicallyfound a multiplicity of meanings, focusing in good pastoral manner on the“tropological” sense—the one that had to do with the moral life of theindividual Christian.The chief importance of Quesnel is that although “Jansenism” was repeatedlycondemned in the late seventeenth century, it was upon Quesnel’s book of“evangelical morals” that the definitive papal condemnation eventually fell. Theactual Augustinus had been condemned by the theological faculty of the Sorbonnein 1649 and also by Pope Innocent X in 1653. But it was the Clementinecondemnation of Quesnel that proved definitive. Pope Clement XI, a seriousChristian but largely lacking in the political skills demanded by his job, wason this issue easily manipulated by the Jesuits. In 1708, the Abrégé (thepopular short version of Quesnel’s Réflexions morales) was blacklisted. But thetrue crisis of Jansenism came to a head only on September 8, 1713, with thepublication of Clement’s bull—destined to become one of the most famous andcontroversial in papal history—beginning Unigenitus dei filius. Unigenituscondemned one hundred and one propositions extracted from Quesnel.Most of them had been condemned earlier. At their center were the five centralerrors concerning grace and the freedom of the will found in Jansen himself. TheOxford Dictionary of the Christian Church succinctly summarizes their burden intwo propositions: (1) that without a special grace from God, the performance ofHis commandments is impossible to men; and (2) that the operation of grace isirresistible: and hence, that man is the victim of either a natural or asupernatural determinism, limited only by not being violently coercive. Anotherway of saying this is that man is “predestined” to damnation or to salvation.III. The Deacon PârisThe publication of the bull Unigenitus animated a large and long-lastingcontroversy within the French Church. The geographical “center” of Jansenism,insofar as there was one, was the religious community at Port-Royal. It is withPort-Royal that most of the great names of Jansenism are associated—thetheologian Arnauld, the philosopher Blaise Pascal, and many others. Its violentsuppression by the Jesuit party was an attempt to put a permanent end to thecontroversy; but of course it failed to do so. In the decades immediatelyfollowing the Unigenitus there were whole parishes in Paris and elsewhere thatmight be called “Jansenist,” in which the clergy tended to be strictly andascetically religious and the parishioners disdainful of the easygoingCatholicism of the royal court and the Jesuits. One of these was the parish ofSaint-Médard. The immediate object of the cult of the Saint-Médard churchyardwas the grave of an obscure deacon, dead at the age of thirty-six, namedFrançois de Pâris. François was of a noble family, originally from Champagne.The second estate of the Ancien Régime was itself composed of two classes: thenoblesse de robe (“nobility of the gown,” whose station depended upon theiradministrative function) and the noblesse de l’épée (“nobility of the sword”),the ancient feudal aristocracy. The family de Pâris was gown nobility.In this family of distinguished lawyers the father assumed that his son, too,would follow a legal calling. Indeed, the young man did study the law, and witha brilliant initial success. But an “irresistible divine grace” had other plansfor him, and after overcoming the forceful parental disapproval that is socommon a feature of the hagiographic texts, François was at the age oftwenty-three at last allowed to follow his vocation of religious life. Inaddition to the normal clerical studies of philosophy and theology, he undertookan intense private regime of biblical studies, guided by the precepts ofQuesnel’s Réflexions.François never joined a religious order, but he followed the example of thesaint for whom he had been named in the intense practice of two particularvirtues: evangelical poverty and humility. Francis of Assisi had tried to giveaway his father’s property while the father was still living; Francis of Parisat least waited until his father was dead, but he then “gave it all to thepoor,” leaving himself in the necessity of manual labor (weaving, in particular)to earn his crusts. His Franciscan humility made him feel unworthy ofpriesthood. He did take the so-called minor orders in 1715, and eventuallyaccepted ordination to the diaconate, normally a stepping stone or even avirtual formality on the path to sacerdotal ordination. But, again like hisearlier namesake, he thought himself unworthy of such an exalted station.Needless to say, a reluctance to seek promotion and preferment was not generallycharacteristic of the French Church of the era.François de Pâris was a thoroughgoing Jansenist in the style of his extremepersonal asceticism, in his associations, and in his opinions. He lamented thesuppression of Port-Royal. He denied the “permanence” of the bull Unigenitus.This was Jansenist-speak, as it were. The Jansenist could not deny the fact ofthe bull, nor did most of them explicitly challenge the authority of Clement.What they maintained was that so important a theological question as that ofdivine grace could be settled only by an ecumenical council. No such council hadtaken place since the Council of Constance in 1415, when a spurious “reunion” ofthe Catholic West and the Orthodox East had been briefly effected. According tothe Jansenists, the Catholic teaching on grace could be determined only by “afuture council”—but they knew what the true Catholic teaching was. It was thatof Augustine of Hippo, doctor of the Church, in his magnificent anti-Pelagianpolemics. So far as the Jansenists were concerned, the theological drift ofUnigenitus was anything but settled law. The matter was “on appeal”—appeal tothe future ecumenical council. The matter was not entirely unlike the situationarising in American political life with regard to certain controversiallegislation that hovers uncomfortably in the public consciousness pending itsratification or rejection by the Supreme Court. There was of course adifference, too. So far as the Jesuits were concerned, the Supreme Court hadalready spoken.The considerable fame of François de Pâris, however, was not that of a publictheological controversialist, even a martyred one. His reputation was that of asaint in a time-hallowed tradition of Catholic spirituality. He was apractitioner of heroic asceticism. Here are two examples, both of them reliablyevidenced by sound historical documents, despite the fact that they echo thespiritual clichés of medieval hagiographical fiction. As a youth, François dePâris had by all accounts been a strikingly good-looking fellow. Item, it isbelieved that he intentionally exposed himself to the smallpox in order that hisfacial beauty might be marred and that, in such a fashion, he be both humbledand, perhaps, insulated from certain worldly temptations. Item, it is welldocumented that he kept the religious fast of Lent with an absolute rigor. Thatis, he ingested absolutely no food at all for the forty days between AshWednesday and Easter eve. This was an austerity not uncommonly reported amongJansenist zealots, but it is made all the more credible in this particular case,as witnesses do allow that he took occasional liquid. Such acts of self-denialwere supplemented by numerous works of corporal mercy to folk, most of them poorlaborers, in and about the parish of Saint-Médard. Thus even in his lifetime thecombination of his notorious Jansenism and his heroic sanctity presented aproblem for the guardians of orthodoxy. He would prove a greater problem to themwhen dead.The persecution of the dead was something of a Bourbon specialty. At Port-Royal,suppression had been brutal; and warfare against nuns was a policy with a publicrelations “downside.” Among some other unsavory manifestations of orthodox zealwas the disinterment of the dead “saints” from the convent cemetery and thescattering of their anti-Pelagian bones. The idea was to deprive livingrigorists of a potentially dangerous site for the observance of an hereticalcult. The result, of course, was to create a hundred others, one for everyknucklebone or femur that could be scavenged and carried off by adherents of thedespised cause. By 1700, relics from the vandalized Port-Royal ossuary wereamong the revered treasures of many parish churches in France, and in particularthe church of Saint-Médard in Paris.IV. The First MiraclesBy the year 1727 the spectacular penances of the Deacon Pâris were alreadylegendary among the Jansenist community. He walked on pilgrimages on painfullylacerated feet. He prayed through the hours that most men slept. He wasobviously starving himself to death. Furthermore, he openly stated that theprincipal circumstance demanding his dramatic penance was the (in his mind)unresolved status of Unigenitus, an affront at once to the old Catholic beliefand to the prerogatives of the King of France.Only a full year after the deacon’s burial would there be placed above the gravethe elaborate and learned Latin encomium composed by the theologian Jandin. Ithad been commissioned and placed there hurriedly, by admirers rightly fearfulthat at any moment the authorities might forbid it. But a temporary marker hadsuccessfully staked a claim. As the beloved ascetic lay dying in the very shadowof the parish church, his admirers seem to have taken prescient action toanticipate what they feared would be the response of orthodox authority to hisdeath. They wanted at least the foundations for a proper tomb prepared as a facton the ground, before they could be forbidden to erect one. Among the lastsounds grasped by the deacon’s fading sense may have been the scraping of thetrowels hurriedly preparing a final resting place for his bones.He died in the night of May 1, 1727. By the time of his funeral on May 3—afuneral widely attended by a broad range of Parisian society, but especially bythe common folk among whom he had lived and worked—he was already enjoying anunofficial canonization. On the very day of the funeral there was a widedistribution of those religious souvenirs otherwise called relics: bits of hisclothing, chips from the marble of his tomb in the making, various materialobjects claimed to have been carried on his person or touched by his hand. PaulValet, a local historian writing in the year 1900, reports that he personallyknew of many such relics in private devotional collections at that date.The miracles at the tomb of the sanctified deacon began at the very funeralservice itself. It is important to stress that the early miracles were as normalas miracles can be, bearing in mind that miracles are “physical phenomena forwhich no satisfactory natural explanation can be found.” The most famousepisode, that of the Convulsionists, would come only later, and it proved almostas embarrassing to some of the Jansenists as it did ludicrous to the scoffers.Deacon Pâris’s miracles were miracles of healing. Many involved the “healing” ofgross physical abnormalities—harelips, clubfeet, palsied limbs—for whichpsychosomatic explanation might seem implausible. Furthermore, many were“attested to” by competent witnesses, including medical professionals, whosetestimony is of the sort that historians normally treat as reliable. We mayconsider a few examples.An old woman, Madeleine Beigney (the widow Piquot), a wool-spinner, was thedeacon’s neighbor and acquaintance. She had always admired his sanctity, butfrom the local chatter about the funeral she learned details of his secretcharities that astonished her and encouraged her in a desperate attempt. One ofthe widow’s arms had hung paralyzed and lifeless for twenty years. As thecortège approached the church, the woman knelt down beside its temporary restingplace, prayed fervently for the new saint’s help, and, as the body appeared,reached up with her undamaged hand and touched its feet. The cure was immediateand, of course, highly public.Some of the beneficiaries were of a certain social prominence. The daughter ofMossaron, a substantial bureaucrat, the business agent for the Grand Duke ofTuscany, suffered a fit of apoplexy—a term used somewhat ecumenically forstrokes and other dramatic neurological disorders. After much unsuccessfulmedical consultation, she undertook a novena (a program of special intentionalprayers of nine days’ duration) at the tomb of Deacon Pâris. Her intention wasto pray for patience, but again there was a sensational cure. On the very firstday she found herself able to kneel, then to make other bodily movementspreviously impossible for her. She was soon able to return to her house in therue de Grenelle and mount its challenging staircases with agility. Her grievousimpairment had vanished totally.Most of the recipients of the saint’s favors were women. There was a specialterm for the deeply religious laywomen who played such an important role in thespiritual life of the Church, and especially among the Jansenists. They werecalled the dévotes—of which our “devotee” is a most imperfect memorial—and thecult at the deacon’s tomb attracted many. But there were also prominent episodesinvolving men. One amusing one is the “case” of the Spanish student Alfonso dePalacios. He had lost the sight of his left eye six years before he appears inour history. In a brawl he received a severe blow to the right eye, leaving himtotally blind for a period of eight days. (Boys will be boys. The great Americanhistorian, Prescott, was blinded in the left eye in a food fight in a Harvardrefectory.) After that Alfonso’s damaged right eye did partially recoup, but ina fashion so debilitated as to leave him incapable of sustained reading. Whetherit was sufficient for brawling we are not told.One deduces Alfonso was not notably pious. His immediate recourse was to themedical profession, who applied various ointments. The quaint names of severalhave been recorded. Madame Macaire’s Mixture (l’eau de Madame Macaire) provedpartially effective, but he was still badly impaired. Only as a last resort didhe undertake a novena at Saint-Médard churchyard. This he did with theencouragement of the famous scholar Charles Rollin. At the same time hecontinued to consult the most renowned oculists in Paris, whose prescribedbleedings he abandoned in favor of a relic, a piece of the dead deacon’s shirt.That bandage seemed to cure the eye completely.That is, perfect vision was restored to the right eye. The left eye remained inthe sightlessness in which it had languished for many years. This fact became ofpolemical importance later. The miraculous healing of the Spanish student’swounded eye is about as well documented as any such thing could be, but it wasstoutly contested by such anti-Jansenists as the archbishop of Sens on thefollowing grounds. Surely if God were going to restore a blind man’s sightmiraculously, he would not restore it in one eye only! Here we have a nice echoof the theologians’ objections to the operations of Greatrakes the Stroker. Ifhe were really a miracle worker, the miracles would not be partial orintermittent. It could be pointed out, however, that the Spanish student hadsought medical relief for his right eye. We may presume that the prayers of hisnovena were directed to the same end. There is on the face of it no reason thatthe principle of parsimony, which plays such an important role in variousphilosophical procedures and theological propositions, might not operate in thissituation. It is one thing to deny that a miracle has occurred. It is quiteanother to tell God how He ought to perform His miracles.We know about these miracles from many sources, but particularly fromLouis-Basile Carré de Montgeron, a highly competent lawyer and magistrate forwhom the defense of Deacon Pâris’s miracles would become a life’s work. SeveralJansenists—like certain Protestants with whom they shared a good deal incommon—report dramatic moments of conversion. The most famous of these wasBlaise Pascal, who on November 23, 1654, was overcome with a direct perceptionof God—“the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, and not thephilosophers and men of science.” (He was himself, of course, a philosopher anda man of science.) Pascal wrote a brief memorial of his moment of conversion,which he carried on his person, invisibly secured within his clothing, for therest of his life.Montgeron had a like moment on September 7, 1731, in the cemetery ofSaint-Médard. According to his autobiography, which despite its evocations ofhagiographic stereotypes we can have no defensible historical reason to dismiss,he had spent his youth in the pursuit of worldly pleasure and advantage, andwithout any particular interest in religion. He went to Saint-Médard if not toscoff, certainly not to pray. He was curious as to what might be the cause ofthe hubbub. But he was in an instant overwhelmed by spiritual intensity andauthenticity. Regarding the sudden healing of a gross moral blindness as hardlyless miraculous than the restoration of physical sight, he forever after listedhimself among those to whom God had shown a special mercy through theintermediation of Deacon Pâris. He memorialized his moment of conversion in afashion somewhat different from that of Pascal. He took it as his vocation toresearch, publish, and defend the miracles of the Saint-Médard churchyard. Thedocumentary evidence he collected is invaluable. Furthermore, he plays a rolewith regard to the activities at Saint-Médard analogous to the role played byStubbe, and to a certain degree by Robert Boyle himself, with regard toGreatrakes the Stroker. It is quite difficult to dismiss Montgeron’s elaboratelydocumented evidence as delusion, and perhaps harder yet to attribute it to badfaith.V. The Convulsions BeginThe events just described—miracles or “miracles,” depending upon one’s point ofview—are a small sample of the notable occurrences surrounding the origins ofthe cult of the Deacon Pâris centered on his tomb in the Saint-Médardchurchyard. As much for political as for spiritual reasons they excited greatinterest, attracted investigation by both the reverent and the skeptical, andelicited a considerable pamphlet literature. The contemporary literarycontroversy surrounding the episode was one of two that marked it, for all itsreactionary strangeness, as belonging to the Age des Lumières. Paris was acomparatively small city in terms of its internal distances, yet largelypopulated with the intellectual elites of the day. One could buy and read apamphlet about the wonders of Saint-Médard churchyard in the morning, and dropby for a personal inspection in the afternoon. This was very different from theprocess by which medieval holy sites had established themselves. The secondpoint is that much of the discussion was medical, as we have seen it was alsowith the stroking miracles of Valentine Greatrakes.In retrospect they became known to some Church historians as the “normal” or the“respectable” miracles of the holy François de Pâris. One of the earlyhistorians of Convulsionism, the antiquary Paul Valet, insists on a point everworth remembering. No hint of fraud or mercenary exploitation attended theseastonishing histories. Nor, at first, did the Jansenist party make much of aneffort to exploit the political dimension.THE FIRST OF THE CERTIFIED Convulsionists was a pubescent girl of aboutthirteen, Marie-Elisabeth Giroust, the daughter of a shopkeeper in the parish ofSaint-Eustache, across the river and at some distance from Saint-Médard. In1731, this girl was suddenly visited with some alarming neurological disorder,apparently grand mal epileptic seizures. The drama of her miraculous cure playedout over the course of the year punctuated by the official closure of theSaint-Médard grounds. Her parents do not seem to have been unusually religious,and their first recourse was to the medical profession. Contemporary medicineknew little about brain function and lacked the pharmacopia with which epilepsyis often controlled today. A program of bleedings did nothing to improve thegirl’s seizures, which remained severe and of frequent occurrence. She was bynow suffering from dramatic full-body convulsions about five or six times a day.At this point the despairing parents decided to implore the supernatural aid ofthe new Jansenist saint surrounding whom there was such lively gossip.A very common Catholic religious practice of the age was the aforementionednovena of petition—a program of prayer extending over nine days, undertaken inthe hope of achieving a special grace, often medical in nature. The novena wasoften undertaken communally—that is, with two or several people praying inconcert for the same goal—and it was often performed at a specific shrine, suchas a local pilgrimage site, or before a particular devotional image in a church.The site might also be in a private place in the home.Toward the end of August 1731, it was determined that the young girl and hermother would perform a novena, with the special intention of invoking the helpof the Deacon Pâris in the healing of the girl’s alarming illness. It is of someinterest in light of what followed that since the girl was suffering suchfrequent convulsions it was deemed inappropriate that she herself should go tothe Saint-Médard cemetery. The mother did indeed go there to pray at thedeacon’s tomb, while Elisabeth herself remained at home to pray.At first there was no change, but by the end of the first of what would becomeseveral novenas, the frequency of the seizures had decreased. The motherdetermined to continue a regime of orchestrated prayer, though in a churchcloser to the family home on the Right Bank. In September, the first eventrecognized as undoubtedly supernatural occurred. The daughter saw a paper packet“trailing over the counter,” and picked it up. Precisely at that moment she wasstruck by a convulsion but one, in the father’s view, completely different inits character than those to which he had become accustomed. The seizure nowseemed to be ecstasy rather than malady. Removing the package from the girl’shands he discovered it contained a cross-reliquary with some relics of DeaconPâris within.Later, while the child slept soundly, the father decided to perform anexperiment. He brought the sanctified materials to her bedside. Immediately,while still asleep, she fell into an ecstatic paroxysm, contorting her bodyfinally into a circular shape. When the father removed the holy parcel from thebedside, the girl’s body immediately relaxed into a posture of more normaldormition. Later, awake, Marie-Elisabeth had no recollection of her happyconvulsions, though she reported an unusual sense of well-being.In its tantalizing combination of specificity (the shape of the portablereliquary) and vagueness (where had the packet come from?), the testimonialdocumentation of the completion of Marie-Elisabeth’s cure continues in themedieval genre of the hagiographical dossier. But it has to be said that, takentogether with many other “cases” from the early history of the deacon’s shrine,the evidence is quite different in texture from that of medieval legend. Theflavor is nearer to that of modern tabloid journalism, which indeed had itsclear parallels in the eighteenth century.It is important to bear in mind that many of the “early” miracles had nothing orlittle to do with convulsions. They were the only ones to command the universalcredence of the “miraculous” party. The episode of the actual Convulsionistsfollowed. Though it is much more famous, the Jansenists themselves wereseriously divided over it. In the history of Convulsionism, Marie-ElisabethGiroust was both a pioneer and a transitional figure. Insofar as any medicalcondition can be confidently diagnosed across the centuries, she was suddenlyattacked by grand mal epilepsy, which for a time was unusually severe. At thetime she entered history, her convulsions were the chief evidence of pathology.By the time of her exit, her convulsions were an evidence of the removal ofpathology.A French sociological scholar, Daniel Vidal, subjected the Convulsionists(Miracles et convulsions jansénistes au xviiie siècle, 1987) to an elaboratesociological and semiotic analysis, linking them with the slightly earlier butsimilar phenomena among the persecuted Camisards, or recusant Huguenots of themountainous hinterlands of the Cévennes in southeastern France. These peoplewere often called “The Tremblers” on account of their frequently physicalmanifestations of spiritual activity. The term had a similar ironic valance tothat of “Holy Roller” still in use today. One chief point of distinction wouldseem to be this. The “French Prophets” (as the English derisively called thecharismatics among the refugee Huguenots) apparently thought of their gyrationsas reduplications of Apostolic “signs and wonders” described in the earlychapters of the Book of Acts. Yet their experience went far beyond the “speakingin tongues” of the biblical account of Pentecost. According to the sermonpreached by the apostle Peter, apparently acting upon the eschatologicalexpectation of having entered the “last days,” the words of the prophet Joel arenow to be fulfilled: “I will pour my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons andyour daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your oldmen shall dream dreams.…” The Convulsionists of Saint-Médard, on the other hand,seem always to have been focused on the medical.VI. PoliticalThe episode of the Convulsionists was necessarily political. The Jansenistcontroversy, while not limited to French territory, was primarily a Frenchphenomenon. Though its doctrinal and spiritual strands were unique to itsparticular moment, Jansenism fit in with a long history of restiveness withinFrench Catholicism. A significant group of the clergy believed that the FrenchChurch enjoyed by ancient tradition a certain comparative independence from theauthority of Rome. This attitude, called Gallicanism, manifested itself invarious ways, and its strength would become apparent in the Revolution at thetime of the proclamation of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy when, withcomparative ease, it proved possible for many Frenchmen, including many clergy,to embrace a Catholicism independent of the Pope. Many scholars trace theGallican ideas of some of the Jansenists to the period of the “Great Schism” ofthe Church in the fourteenth century. The faithful of Europe then witnessed thehighly unedifying spectacle of competing claimants to the throne of Peter, oneof whom was seated in “French” territory at Avignon. Some of the great Frenchtheologians of the period, especially Pierre d’Ailly and Jean Gerson, argued for“conciliarism,” a doctrine that held that final authority within the Churchcould be exercised only by action of an ecumenical council.In their attitude toward the Unigenitus, the Jansenists were “conciliarists”:they made their appeal to the decision of a future council. In retrospect we cansee that the invocation of conciliarism was a plank in a lost cause. Thedirection of Church history would be toward augmented, not diminished papalpower. The doctrine of plenary papal authority was called “Ultramontanism”—aphrase that derives from the Latin for “across the mountains.” The country fromwhich the Pope was across the mountains was of course France. Yet at the timethe Gallican tradition considerably complicated the secular politics of thesituation. The Jansenists could argue with a certain plausibility that inresisting the Unigenitus they were exercising an ancient French exceptionalismthat mimicked the independence and autonomy of the King of France. The Jesuits,who were the stout defenders of Unigenitus, were the shock troops of the Pope,who at least since the thirteenth century had been attempting to aggrandize hispowers at the expense of the French monarchy.An able historian, B. Robert Kreiser, has written a comprehensive book—Miracles,Convulsions, and Ecclesiastical Politics in Early Eighteenth Century Paris(1978)—about the episode of the Convulsionists, and in it he elegantly unravelsits twisted secular and spiritual strands. The history of Christianity teachesthat if the compulsion of religious conformity is difficult, the compulsion ofreligious belief is impossible. Almost any action undertaken with the intentionof achieving a particular result has the potential to achieve one verydifferent. The attempts to suppress Jansenism were often sensationallycounterproductive. The final “dissolution” of the religious house of Port-Royaldes Champs had been particularly brutal. The fate of ancient Shechem, plowedwith salt, had hardly been more drastic.The witticism that the Bourbon monarchs “never forgot anything and never learnedanything,” dubiously attributed to Talleyrand, is brilliantly exemplified in thesuppression of the Holy-Rolling in the Saint-Médard churchyard. It duplicated inminiature the more drastic error of the suppression of Port-Royal itself. Amongother humiliations inflicted upon that nursery of theological error was thedisinterment of the bones of several of the late saints. Here the intention onthe part of the triumphant ecclesiastical party had been “to prove theirdoctrines orthodox through apostolic blows and knocks,” and to raze from theearth sites that might in the future serve as shrines to the adherents of adespised cause. But the scattered bones of the dead Jansenists, or what were atleast believed to be those bones, clandestinely gathered or purchased by theiradmirers, now found a home in the reliquaries of half the parish churches ofParis, and many more beyond in the countryside. One of the remarkable featuresof the cult of Deacon François de Pâris was its immediate profusion andcirculation of relics, many of which feature in the miraculous cures or in theirconvulsionary testimonies.The sealing off of the Saint-Médard churchyard turned out to be similarlycounterproductive, from the “Jesuit” point of view. It in effect transformedConvulsionism from a phenomenon into what the historian Kreiser calls amovement. For “by forcing the convulsionaries to disperse, the royal ordinancehad the unanticipated effect of further spreading the cult and rousing itsadherents to even greater heights of religious enthusiasm.” The contrived dramaof modern political demonstrations is no novelty. The continuing controversyover the bull Unigenitus was of such heat as to give birth to its own newspaper,the famous Nouvelles ecclésiastiques. Its pages now, in Kreiser’s words,“described the pathetic scene among the shocked and troubled people atSaint-Médard. They gathered around the little parish church, consternation anddespair visible on nearly every face. Some were moaning or sobbing others stoodby in stunned disbelieving silence.…”The dispossessed of Saint-Médard churchyard regrouped into dozens of smallenclaves meeting in private homes, in sympathetic parish churches, in theresidences and schools of like-minded clergy. To believe in one or more of thefive rather arid theological propositions condemned by the Unigenitus is at mostardency of a tepid degree. But belief in a miracle one has experienced in one’sbody, or heard reported from a family member or friend, is likely to have a realheat about it.There was, furthermore, a sociological factor of some importance. Theparishioners of Saint-Médard and several of the other “Jansenist” congregationstended to belong to the more economically vulnerable members of the Frenchpopulation, including a significant number of day laborers. The experience ofthe Convulsionists provided spiritual justification for an anti-monarchicalattitude. It has more than once been suggested that the convulsionnaires of 1730were the spiritual grandparents of the sans-culottes of 1790.The authenticity of the miracles of Saint-Médard was at first virtually anarticle of Jansenist belief. Before long, however, the promiscuous writhings ofthe convulsed, which at first glance more closely resembled sexual indulgencethan medical treatment, became a cause of acute embarrassment. Several Jansenisttheologians distanced themselves from them, and more or less actively connivedwith the police authorities for their suppression. Even among this group,however, there was a universal defense of the “original” miracles of the tomb,before the more extravagant charisms became the focus of attention.THE MEMORY OF THE Convulsionists remained vivid throughout the middle and laterdecades of the eighteenth century, and Voltaire included an article on“Convulsions” in the Dictionnaire philosophique. Voltaire attributed to Madamedu Maine, who certainly commanded sufficient wit and wickedness to allow us totrust the attribution, some scoffing verses that probably well reflected theBourbon aristocracy’s disdain both for the theology of the Convulsionists andfor the social standing of many of their adepts:Un décrotteur à la royaleDu talon gauche estropié,Obtint pour grace specialeD’être boiteux de l’autre pied.*But the subject of the Saint-Médard miracles presented Voltaire with a surfeitof targets, and he could not confidently decide which was most worthy of hisscorn. In another article in the Dictionary (s.v. “Eloquence”) he expressed hisalarm at Bishop Masillon’s famous sermon “On the Smallness of the Number ofThose to Be Saved.” Masillon was no Jansenist, but it would be hard todistinguish his view of a Heaven with a population density roughly that of theGobi Desert from the views of Augustine at his gloomiest. These views were farfrom agreeable to what René Pomeau called the philosophes’ “optimistic Deism.”But of all the rotten fruits of the Christian religion Voltaire perhaps detestedmost thoroughly the fanaticism of persecution, and the Jansenists, thoughperhaps repellent in his eyes, were also a people persecuted. Furthermore, agood rule of thumb for “infidels” of that age seems to have been “When in doubt,blame the Jesuits first.” So the better part of Voltaire’s brief article isgiven over to the abuse of the Jansenists’ abusers, who are supposed to haveacted in spiteful jealousy at the superior reputation of the Saint-Médardmiracles to those performed by the early Jesuit wonder-worker, St. FrancisXavier, the Apostle of India.It is perhaps hardly surprising that the prince of scoffers should scoff at theextravagances of the churchyard of Saint-Médard. What is more remarkable is thatthe strange phenomena should gain such widespread credit in the face of thehostility of the Catholic authorities of Bourbon France, who found them hardlymore comfortable than Cambridge Platonists had found the strokings of ValentineGreatrakes.BibliographicalThough much of the work devoted to the Convulsionists is in French, the singlemost comprehensive book on the episode is B. Robert Kreiser’s excellentMiracles, Convulsions, and Ecclesiastical Politics in Early Eighteenth-CenturyParis (Princeton, 1978). It has a nearly exhaustive bibliography for the periodup to publication. As the title suggests, its principal focus is on broaderecclesiastical politics. Robert Bruce Mullin’s Miracles and the Modern ReligiousImagination (New Haven, 1996) deals with the problem of miracles and the modernconsciousness. There are some essays of general background relevance inEnthusiasm and Enlightenment in Europe, 1650–1850, ed. Lawrence Klein andAnthony La Vopa (Huntington Library, 1998).Daniel Vidal, Miracles et convulsions jansénistes au XVIIIe siècle: Le mal et saconnaissance (Paris, 1987), is of particular interest for, among other reasons,its statistical method.For Jansenism, there is an engaging English-language introduction by J. D.Crichton (James Dunlop), Saints or Sinners: Jansenists and Jansenism inSeventeenth-Century France (Dublin, 1966). Sainte-Beuve’s enduring masterpiecePort-Royal is available in several English translations, but it is a majorundertaking.Among the French books I have used are Jacques-François Thomas, La querelle del’Unigenitus (Paris, 1950), and Monique Cottret, Jansénismes et Lumières: Pourun autre xviiie siècle (Paris, 1998).* A bootblack born of highest race,His left foot crippled, sad to tell,Achieved through a miraculous graceLameness in the right as well."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/p106.jpg]Johann Valentin Andreae (1586-1654) was an erudite Lutheran theologian, thealter ego of the legendary Christian Rosenkreuz, and the probable author of theChymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosencreutz anno 1459 (The Chymical Wedding ofChristian Rosenkreutz in 1459), one of the fundamental texts of Rosicrucianism,first published in 1616. The degree to which he was seriously committed toalchemy is uncertain. In his later years he referred to his early work as aludibrium, a jeu d’esprit.3 The Rosy Cross [../Text/content.xhtml#ch3]ONE OF THE PARADOXES of the Enlightenment, a paradox long observed and variouslyexplained, is the fascination of many of the enlightened with the occult.Referring to the group of political mystics founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776, aFrench literary historian has noted with at least rhetorical surprise that “TheAge of the Lumières was also the Age of the Illuminati.” This implies, at thevery least, a considerable elasticity in the word “enlightened.” Sir IsaacNewton was among the greatest geniuses of his or any other age. Yet hisinvestment in the mysteries of biblical prophecy was not less lavish than hissuccessful attempt to define the fundamental laws of the physical world. Thathis Principia mathematica might one day become in the minds of his intellectualpeers more valuable than the Book of Daniel would have struck him aspreposterous.The young Wordsworth gazing upon Newton’s statue in his Cambridge college chapelfamously saw “the marble index of a mind forever voyaging through strange seasof thought alone.” Yet so far as many of his stranger interests were concerned,Sir Isaac was far from alone. They might even be said to have been typical ofthe intellectuals of his age, and of the Enlightenment generally. Hence verylittle in this book, and practically nothing in this chapter, can advancewithout a consideration of the concept of the occult. This is because so verymuch Enlightenment thought, including that of many of its most brilliantthinkers, was given over to occult pursuits. The ambition of this chapter is,first, to offer some suggestion of what the occult is, or was, and then toattempt a sketch of the sociology of occultism. For though there were“occultists” everywhere, one distinctive institution of the period, Freemasonry,had a unique historical influence on its social manifestations.The task of discussing the occult, though needful, is hardly congenial. That isbecause the occult, both as concept and as word, has fallen on hard times, givenover mainly to strange magazines printed on strange paper by strange publishers.The modern fate of “occultism” is a conspicuous example of the kind of sweepingintellectual change that makes the just appreciation of the intellectual life ofpast times so difficult. What was once considered as the essence of science hasnow been banished by most scientists.The word “occult” is the English form of the Latin past participle of a verbmeaning “to cover over,” “to conceal,” “to hide.” The word bears no necessaryassociation of motive or purposefulness, that is to say no necessary connectionto things hidden by human intention. It meant simply “not visibly apparent.” Theold usage survives in our language, though rarely. Pathologists routinely searchfor “occult blood” in human waste. The road sign “Hidden Driveway” refers to anobjective fact, not an intentional deception. Hence in the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries the idea of the investigation of the “occult” brought tomind what we usually think of as the “scientific enterprise”—the attempt todiscover aspects of Nature previously unknown.The vocabulary of luminosity self-consciously adopted by so many of the period’sseekers after truth, whether as would-be masters or would-be disciples, can beconfusing to the scholar intent on making accurate distinctions among cognateschools of thought. Yet one can see how intimate is the connection betweenoccultism and Enlightenment simply from a consideration of the concept of lightitself. Enlightenment—Les Lumières—penetrated the dark crevices of ignorance andsuperstition.One sees also the antiquity of the concept, which characterizes the claims ofall the world’s great religions, including Christianity. The enlightened,whether they sought to clarify and refine the old religion or to overthrow italtogether, had inherited some of the assumptions on which its foundationrested. Lux in tenebris lucet, read the famous Vulgate phrase from the Prologueto the Gospel of John: “The light shines on in the dark, and the darkness hasnever mastered it.” In the recent Encyclopédie de la Franc-Maconnerie (in thearticle “Illumination”), Eric Saunier has published an English engraving of theearly nineteenth century, hardly different in spirit from the Renaissance“emblems” of Alciati, allegorically depicting the three “great lights” ofMasonry, to wit, the try square, the compass, and the Sacred Law (the Bible).The more conventional mason’s tools (compass and try square) are crossed adquadratum, in the usual allegorical manner, and the opening of the folio Bibleacross which they rest clearly reveals the selected text: the beginning of theGospel of John.The prophetic Isaian text once universally known throughout Christendom andstill widely known through Handel’s Messiah—“The people who dwelt in darknesshave seen a great light”—actually played a role in many of the rituals ofMasonic initiation. This tradition of early Masonry, which probably should beconnected with ancient Christian rituals of the “first fire” of the PaschalVigil, reenacted in quasi-liturgical form the initiate’s passage from darknessto light. It became a standard feature of the ritual of many secret societies ofthe nineteenth century, and survives today in the Greek letter fraternities andsororities of our colleges and universities.The term “Illuminism” has been stretched thin over the considerable breadth ofseventeenth- and eighteenth-century “spiritual” schools, ranging from that ofthe independent-minded Lutheran Jakob Boehme (1575–1624) to that of theindependent-minded Catholic Karl von Eckharthausen (1752–1803), eventuallymelding (with Madame Blavatsky and others) in institutional “Theosophy”—a termintentionally invented to join together the old concepts of “practical” and“speculative” or theoretical philosophy famous in Boethius. Among the mostbrilliant constellation of French “Illuminists” are the often-confused gurusMartines de Pasqually, who died in 1774, and the more famous Louis-Claude deSaint-Martin (1743–1803), “the Unknown Philosopher,” the fountainhead of“Martinism,” whose eminent disciples were legion in the Revolutionary period andbeyond, and who has disciples yet.I alluded a moment ago to one of the more famous groups calling themselvesIlluminati (Illuminaten in German, also called “the Illuminati of Bavaria”). TheIlluminati were founded by Adam Weishaupt, a disenchanted canon lawyer, in 1776.They formed an actual secret order or society with a complex internal structurethat soon led to complicated internal sectarian struggles. Only a few of the“secret” societies of the eighteenth century actually remained sufficientlysecret to hide from inquiring historians, but there are aspects of this group’sstranger teachings that remain opaque. The German Weishaupt was reacting, as somany French thinkers had earlier, to what he regarded as the obscurantism of theJesuits, who had by his time long since become a powerful force in educating theyouth of Catholic countries. His anti-clericalism had at the very least aseriously radical political potential, which found a place also in several otherof the secret societies of German-speaking regions. The secrecy was both anindex of their “occult” pursuits and a necessity of their politics. ThoughWeishaupt himself had a dim view of Freemasonry, his disciple and laterantagonist Adolf Franz Knigge (1752–1796) became an enthusiastic Mason who triedto advance Illuminist causes through existing Masonic lodges. It has frequentlybeen assumed that Cagliostro, in his later development, had intimate contactwith German Illuminati.One problem presented to the contemporary student of occultism is the nature ofthe “scholarship” concerning it. Not surprisingly, perhaps, much of it has beenwritten by occultists themselves—that is, by partisans of esoteric doctrine,including magicians and religious cranks. In France, a good deal of such workwas of a high quality. There was a continuous tradition of serious eruditionthat links, for example, the kabbalist Antoine Fabre d’Olivet (1767–1825) withthe occultist “Marc Haven,” the nom de plume of Emmanuel Lalande, therevisionist biographer of Cagliostro in the early twentieth century. In Englandand especially in America the tradition has tended more to the eccentric and thedubious, though with striking exceptions, including such outstanding scholarlybooks as Frances Yates’s The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age (1979).This work indirectly demonstrates many of the frequently overlooked continuitiesto be found in a good deal of Enlightenment thought. Several of the best studiesare “literary”—in effect chapters in the intellectual history of importantfigures such as de Maistre, Chateaubriand, or Hugo. The most valuable singlework on the subject remains the old two-volume study of occult backgrounds ofnineteenth-century French Romanticism: Auguste Viatte’s Les sources occultes duRomantisme: Illuminisme, Théosophie, a gold mine of synthesized information thatrichly deserves (but has not yet received) an English translation.It is perhaps a fine historical irony that the precise doctrines andinterrelations of so many seekers after light should be clouded in opacity; butsome important generalizations do clearly emerge. One of them is the persistencethroughout the Enlightenment of what one may call the Spiritual Quest. And hereI use the word “Spiritual” in its broad Pauline sense, as the necessarilysuperior element in a hierarchical relationship of flesh and spirit, matter andspirit, letter and spirit. There was a materialist strain in Western thought,though highly attenuated, especially in the Latin tradition. Lucretius wasunknown until the Renaissance, and even then not very widely known. He was atany rate a poet. Hobbes is usually called a materialist, and with sufficientreason. In the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, the baron d’Holbach,contributor to the Encyclopédie and author of various pseudonymousanti-religious works, published his very ambitious System of Nature in a“scientific” spirit comparable to that of contemporary atheist scientists likeRichard Dawkins. But it can hardly be too strongly stressed that his attitudeswere, in his time, regarded as eccentric in the extreme by men who thought the“scientific” spirit was that of Newton or Kepler.Within the larger intellectual context of the Enlightenment such materialism wasmarginal and aberrant. The mainstream of European thought was not materialistbut sacramental. In the sacramental view, the material and visible worldparalleled another that was immaterial and invisible.Scholars can (and do) engage in heated debate about the precise nature ofpost-Platonic Platonism (sometimes called Neo-Platonism) in the premodernEuropean scene. They write of the “Platonism” of the theologians of the Schoolof Chartres in the twelfth century. There is the fifteenth-century FlorentinePlatonic Academy, associated with (among other famous names) that of MarsilioFicino. The great vernacular literature of the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies often bears the deep impress of one or another form of Platonicthought. In the fourth and fifth centuries St. Augustine found almost everythingessential to Christianity in the Platonic doctrines. So proximate were Plato andChrist, he wrote, that all the leading Platonists of his day had been convertedto Christianity at the very small expense of making a few adjustments to theirphilosophical vocabulary. All medieval and Renaissance “revivals” of Plato wereexplicitly conducted as significant augmentations of orthodox Christiantheology—even when some of the less enlightened guardians of orthodoxy mightdemur. In seventeenth-century England Henry More (1614–1687), friend andintimate of leading members of the Royal Society, was the unofficial leader ofthe Cambridge Platonists, who exercised a significant influence on theircontemporary Anglican theologians.SO FAR AS EUROPEAN cultural history is concerned, the Christian versions ofPlatonism are the most important. For us the phrase “the invisible world” islikely to sound odd, if not actually creepy, a term from the lexicon of thenineteenth-century table-rappers. Yet there was in Europe for well over athousand years a universal belief in the “invisible world.” The first clause ofthe Nicene Creed, the fundamental statement of Christian belief, attests thatGod is the Creator of all things visible and invisible. One great medievalistdefined the vast task of all of medieval theology as an attempt to bridge thegap between the empirical world of sensory experience and the unseen world of aspiritual realm. St. Thomas Aquinas, whose system eventually became the“official” theology of the Roman Catholic Church, wrote that “there is nothingin the mind that was not previously in the senses.”The entire sacramental system of Catholicism is “Platonic.” A sacrament is asign—“an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace,” accordingto the language of the Anglican catechism. The bread and the wine, real materialelements, are likewise spiritual realities.But perhaps the most pervasive mode of this kind of Platonism was literary in aquite concrete sense. It had to do with the interpretation of the sacred text.St. Paul himself was the first writer to use the word “allegory” in a Christiancontext. He found an allegory in the history of the offspring of the PatriarchAbraham through his two wives, Sarah and the bondwoman Hagar. He did notdiscount the historicity of the account in Genesis, but Isaac and Ishmael, thetwo women’s respective sons, were more importantly figures of a futurehistorical reality, that is, the Old Covenant and the New. Paul also found abroad figural meaning in the history of the Exodus. His general word for thehidden or occult meaning of the Scriptures was spiritual: “The Letter kills, butthe Spirit gives life.” Although in medieval Christianity this text was oftenenough used in anti-Judaic polemic, it in fact reflected a commonplace of theexegesis of the Jewish scholars of late Antiquity. The Judaism of the Levantinediaspora was already heavily Hellenized, meaning that in part it was heavilyPlatonized. One need only turn to one of the most productive and influential ofHellenized Jewish writers—Philo of Alexandria, a learned contemporary ofJesus—to appreciate the depth of the belief that the words of the Scripturecontained hidden or occult meanings.As regards the development of modern experimental science, the sacramentalassumption entailed ambivalent implications. A theologian whose chief interestin birds is to find in the Phoenix, mythical “Arabian bird,” an emblem of theself-sacrifice and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, is perhaps unlikely to become aknowledgeable ornithologist. Nor will we find a modern zoologist in the medievalfriar and collector of animal exempla who perceives a noble ascetic lesson inthe action of the beaver. The beaver (castor, in Latin), when hotly pursued byhis carnivore enemy, escapes by castor-ating himself, leaving the detachedtesticles in the path to distract his pursuers, while he makes his way tosafety. (This is an allegory of the ascetic vow of chastity, taken by those whoflee the world and “make of themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of God’s sake.”)By the seventeenth century most educated people in Europe, and virtually allpeople in the countries of the Reform, were laughing at the old “monkish” (oneof their favorite words) learning. Renaissance thinkers had long scorned andabandoned it. One of the funniest chapters in Rabelais is his parodic cardcatalogue of the famous monastic library of the great Abbey of Saint-Victor,that nursery of great theologians and mystics. A chief object of satire is thepreposterous etymological allegories of such titles as “The Bagpipe of thePrelates” or “The Teeth-chatter of Gum-diddler of Lubberly Lusks.” But very fewwere abandoning the search for analogies between the structures of two worlds,one seen, one occult.“All men by nature desire to know,” writes Aristotle in the famous introductionto the Metaphysics. “An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses;for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and aboveall others the sense of sight. For not only with a view to action, but even whenwe are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everythingelse. The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and bringsto light many differences between things.” One distinction occurs immediately:that between desiring to know and actually knowing. “It is the peculiar featureof the human mind,” says Kant, “to pose questions it is unable to answer.” Inthe gap betwixt reach and grasp lie many of the more shadowy episodes ofEnlightenment.The RosicruciansIn my youth there used to appear in magazines and journals, and even on theinsides of matchbook covers, advertisements, puzzling to me, inviting me to sendoff for information concerning the Rosicrucians. I didn’t know what aRosicrucian was, of course, but the memorable detail that sticks in my mind isthe tagline to the ad: “AMORC—not a religion.” I did not then realize that AMORCwas an abbreviation, not a magic word, and that it stands for the macaronicphrase “Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis.” The Rosicrucians claimed anancient ancestry, and they flourished in all the intellectual capitals of theEnlightenment. But was there actually such a thing as organized Rosicrucianism?Is it possible for something that does not exist to exercise important influenceon the intellectual climate of an age?On the other hand one can say with confidence that Freemasonry, of which theMystical Order of Rosicrucians was an ancestor, branch, affiliate, descendant,or parallel—always depending upon which Masonic historian is consulted—certainlyexisted. It was one of the most impressive social institutions of the eighteenthcentury, and within its confines historians have plausibly discovered importantand even formative influence on such crucial developments as the rise ofscience, the French Revolution, and the emergence of the modern system ofindustrial capitalism. European Masonry became significant in the seventeenthcentury. Its earlier history is somewhat obscure. That fact is of littlerelevance to our project, however, since for the Enlightenment Masons it was themythical history that mattered.The Masons claimed an ancient lineage, one that went back at the very least toKing Solomon, the builder of the Jerusalem Temple. Its major metaphors andsymbols were taken from architecture and stonemasonry, the defining emblem tothis day being a device in which the architect’s compass crosses with thestoneworker’s try square. Solomon was known for his wisdom, much of which inMasonic lore was connected with the arts of design, stonecutting, building, andthe mysteries of the numerical ratios revealed in those arts. As we shall see,some Enlightenment Masons claimed an origin more ancient yet, in the Egyptianarchitects of the Great Pyramids; but all also acknowledged an importantmedieval European connection. That was with the Knights Templar, the order offighting monks brutally suppressed by Clement V and King Philip the Fair in theearly fourteenth century. This supposed medieval episode of Freemasonry hadparticular implications for men of the Enlightenment for whom it prefigured thewarfare between enlightened Masonry and the obscurantist Roman Church.The reason that some consideration of the separate though converging historiesof Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry becomes obligatory is their shared role in thetransmission of occult ideas and occult practice. Rosicrucianism and Freemasonrywere the principal channels for the transmission of numerous ideas and practicesthat, at least at first blush, might seem at odds with the most fundamentalcharacteristics of the Enlightenment: its exaltation of the Rule of Reason, andthe adoption of the scientific spirit.The secondary literature dealing with Rosicrucianism is now vast, and it cannotbe the intention of this chapter to make a review of it. A good deal of theliterature will strike the general reader as very odd indeed. To plunge intosuch a tar pit would be fatal, and even a toe-dip is not without its risks.Fortunately there are a few excellent guides. One of these is a general historyby Christopher McIntosh: The Rosicrucians: The History, Mythology, and Ritualsof an Esoteric Order. The dean of Renaissance esoterica, the late Frances Yatesof the Warburg Institute, published her revolutionary Rosicrucian Enlightenmentin 1972. It includes English translations of the principal Rosicrucianmanifestos, which are also available in the older book (1924) of Arthur EdwardWaite: The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross. In 1986, the two hundredth birthday ofJohann Valentin Andreae (to whom the reader will shortly be introduced) wascelebrated with a collection of erudite essays that raised the level ofdiscussion of historic origins to an altogether new height. There have beennumerous other serious studies by theologians and literary historians—JohnWarwick Montgomery and Donald Dickson conspicuous among them.Whatever may be the remote sources of Rosicrucianism, its actual public originswere textual, to be found in a few remarkable writings associated with theGerman theologian Johann Valentin Andreae. The two most famous of these bear thetitles Fama Fraternitatis (The History of the Brotherhood) and the ChymischeHochzeit Christiani Rosenkreuz (The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosecross).The weasel-phrase “associated with” is required by unresolved scholarly doubtsas to the authorship of the Fama. In his later life Andreae dismissedRosicrucianism as a ludibrium, a little joke, and that for some has made it seemunlikely that he could have been its founder. But there is another view, forthere was in the Renaissance the genre known as joca seria, serious jokes. Worldliterature would be the poorer without The Praise of Folly or Swift’s ModestProposal. Anyone familiar with the role of the Fool in King Lear will be able tograsp the concept.Johann Andreae is a solidly historical personage, but it is his emblematiccreature, Rosenkreuz, who first claims our attention. Who was ChristianusRosenkreuz? Among the legendary casualties of the Second Vatican Council weresome revered etymological saints—saints, that is, who had a merely lexical asopposed to an historical existence. St. Veronica was a legendary lady who withher handkerchief wiped the sweat from the agonized face of Jesus as he staggeredtoward crucifixion. A miraculous image of Christ’s face was imprinted on thecloth. It was a vera icona (true image) of the Saviour and one of the greatrelics of the Middle Ages; soon enough the woman took the name of the thing: St.Veronica!According to an ancient legend hardly cleansed of its pagan origins a giganticdog-headed man once ferried the Christ-child across a river on his shoulder. TheLatin verb fero means “to carry.” Soon enough the giant exchanged his canine fora human head and took a human name: Christopher, that is “the Christ-bearer.” Ata stroke of the Council’s pen, the “protector of travelers” imaged in a millionkey rings returned to legend. Perhaps nothing better exemplifies the truemedievalism of Enlightenment Illuminism than the eponymous founder ofRosicrucianism, Christian Rosenkreuz, whose imaginary birth may have not takenplace in 1378, just as his supposed death at age 106 certainly did not takeplace in 1484. The two elements of the “surname”—“rose” and “cross”—might invitespeculation even without the Christian name. In fact, “Christian Rosencreuz”occupied the same metaphysical space as Spenser’s “Red Crosse Knight” in TheFaerie Queene. “Rose” means both the flower and the color of the flower (rosy),and Rosicrucian symbolism exploited both possibilities to the full. Theambiguity was further enhanced when the German name was translated into Latin.The rosy cross was complemented by the golden cross, gold of course being theproductive end of what they called the “Great Work” (Magnum opus) of alchemy,which for the Rosicrucians was first a spiritual and only incidentally amaterial quest.In another exact parallel with legendary medieval sanctity, the perfectly intactand uncorrupted body of Christian Rosenkreuz (or C::R::C, as he came to beknown) was eventually discovered in his seven-sided tomb, along with certaindocuments destined to fascinate some of the great minds of Europe for the nexttwo centuries.Johann Andreae himself, though much more “historical,” is hardly lessmysterious. Beneath the odd Latin genitive form of the surname, which perhapsemblematically suggests the fusion of ancient Latin learning and vernacularReformed contemporaneity in which he was raised, is the equivalent of the modernEnglish Andrews. Andreae was born in 1586 into a large Lutheran clerical familyin Herrenberg, about sixty miles east of Strassburg, in a part of Germany thatwas the mystical nursery of several of the other figures touched upon in thisbook.One can identify certain clear strands of traditional biography. Andreae was inthe first place the time-honored “sickly child” of old history books. Hisphysical ailments, which were numerous and severe, encouraged an ascetic spiriton the one hand and on the other a practical interest in medicine, the discoveryof natural potions, and the confection of herbal remedies. He became, that is,an amateur chemist, and for a time the ward of two students “trained in both ofthe medicines”—meaning the old mechanistic tradition deriving from Galen andwhat Montgomery calls “the new iatrochemical-alchemical approach of Paracelsus.”The single greatest and most enduring influence on Andreae’s intellectualdevelopment was a certain Mattias Hafenreffer. As a young deacon in the churchat Herrenberg, Hafenreffer had actually baptized the infant. Later, as professorof theology and mathematics at Tübingen, he became Andreae’s lifelong friend andmentor. Hafenreffer was a theologian of unwavering orthodoxy, but also generousand imaginative.He represented very clearly what the Protestant theologians of his age meant bythe idea of Reform. Though they for the most part rejected the scleroticScholasticism of the late Middle Ages, they often continued to use some of itstechnical theological vocabulary. The specialized meaning of the word “form”(forma) was “the essential inhering principle,” that which made the thing thething it was. To re-form the Church was nothing other than to return it to firstprinciples and practices, to recover a noble past obscured by the fog of theages and tarnished with the excrescences of human invention. The ApocalypticChrist had said: “Behold, I am making all things new.” (Rev. 21:5) Renovatio wasreformatio.The vivifying rediscovery of old wisdom long forgotten, a central ambition ofthe Renaissance project, was no less a central project of the German Reform. AsWarwick Montgomery has convincingly demonstrated, Andreae’s Rosicrucian“vision,” for all its hermetic ideas and iconography, was radically grounded notmerely in his Christian orthodoxy but in his sense of Christian mission. This isa fundamental truth, but one that has not always been fully appreciated byhistorians of the Enlightenment.Two apparent features of Andreae’s mind-set may help us understand thesuperficial strangeness of his literary production, a strangeness that mayocclude his most fundamental purposes. One of them is broadly historical, theother more personal, and based in literary sensibility. Well before Andreae’stime, the Reformation in Germany had proved to be a very rough ride. Somehistorians have gone so far as to speak of a “spiritual crisis” following uponthe age of the great Lutheran founders. Too often the movement claiming torestore purity in the Church had brought with it the death and destruction ofsectarian warfare. One of the leading scholars of the “Tübingen circle” ofvisionary and utopian thinkers of which Andreae was a member attributes theiractivities at least as much to near despair as to idealism. There is inAndreae’s work, and in that of many of his associates, a conscious renovation ofthe early reforming spirit.This aspect of his thought is characteristic of all his writings, but it findsits most explicit (and therefore most easily grasped) statement in the bookcalled the Christianapolis, an imaginary invocation of an ideal or utopianChristian community. It is not accidental that the utopian mode ischaracteristic of the Age of Religious Reform. More’s Utopia dates from 1516,Campanella’s City of the Sun from the turn of the seventeenth century.The recurrent persona in Andreae’s works is a pilgrim, one who has “wandered asa stranger on the earth, suffering much in patience from tyranny, sophistry, andhypocrisy.” The pilgrim of his utopian vision has an odd name of the sortbeloved of the erudite humanists: Cosmoxenus Christianus, “Christian theWorld-Stranger.” He is clearly enough a version of the Pauline pilgrim who hason earth “no continuing city,” of whom the Christian of John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’sProgress is only the most famous among hundreds. We learn that the island-cityof the heart’s desire was founded anciently by an exile like himself. The exilewas religion—a word here used in its old Christian-Latin technical sense to meanthe formal “religious life,” a “religious order,” the spiritual life asorganized by vow around an ascetic community. Once again we see articulate theconnection between the esoteric brotherhoods of the Enlightenment period and theold orders of Catholic monasticism banished by the Protestants.The allegory of Andreae’s Christianapolis is for the most part no less dreary or“medieval” than its genre, but there is something surprising and felicitous atits core. This is the city’s creed, spelled out in the traditional twelvearticles legendarily supplied, one clause each, by the twelve Apostles. It is amost generous statement. “One particularly interesting aspect of the creed ofChristianapolis,” writes Andreae’s biographer, Montgomery, “is its de factoecumenicity.” The Rosicrucian manifestos would radiate a similar spirit.A second point was Andreae’s ambiguous and nuanced response to the old learningof the Middle Ages. We are so used to hearing that the Renaissance “rejected”the Middle Ages that we may be unprepared for all the important ways in whichthe Renaissance kept the Middle Ages alive. Andreae was an accommodationist, nota rejectionist. He was a writer of theological or philosophical romances. Thefirst English translator of The Chemical Wedding grasped this fact perfectly inthe title he gave to the work: The Hermetic Romance. Thus the literaryhistorians may have something to teach us, no less than the theologians andphilosophers.THE ENGLISH LITERARY SCHOLAR W. P. Ker once made a fascinating contrast betweenthe great humanist poets and the great humanist reformers. We are tempted toexaggerate the rejection of the old learning by the new learners of theRenaissance. It is true that the humanist rejection of the late medievalacademic cant of the dogmatic theologians could be brutal. One of themasterpieces of early German humanism is the satirical collection of imaginaryletters called the Epistolae obscurorum virorum or Letters from Obscure Men(1515–19). This work grew out of a controversy in which the humanist scholarReuchlin had become embroiled precisely about the value of old books, and it isrelevant to the esoteric investigations of the Rosicrucians. Reuchlin haddeveloped a knowledgeable interest in the Hebrew language, and had made aspecial study of the conventions and techniques of Jewish scriptural exegesis,including kabbala. As we shall presently see, this interest was actually alreadyof ancient pedigree in Christian exegetical circles, but it was to become aprominent feature of much esoteric speculation in the Enlightenment period aswell. A Dominican convert from Judaism named Johannes Pfefferkorn, now turnedferocious anti-Semite, was advocating with a convert’s zeal the burning of theTalmud and other religious books of the Jews. The authors of the imaginaryletters circulated among the friars pitilessly mocked both their poverty ofthought and the poverty of their Latin. But this was not the only possibleattitude, and it was certainly not Andreae’s.images [../Images/p123.jpg]The first English translation of The Chemical Wedding appeared in London in1690. The translator was Ezekiel Foxcroft, a meritocratic Etonian and scholar ofKing’s College, Cambridge, and a man known to Sir Isaac Newton. He was a friendof More, the Cambridge Platonist, and the author of a testimonial letterendorsing the miracle worker Valentine Greatrakes.“Most great writers begin with some sort of critical opposition to the follies,vanities, pedantries, and dullness of their predecessors and contemporaries,”wrote Ker. But for great imaginative giants like Rabelais and Cervantes, such anattitude is but a beginning. “Too much emphasis has been laid on their hostilityto the dullness of the past; too little has been made, perhaps of their sympathywith the things they laughed at.” Cervantes could not have written his greatspoof of romance were he not a great lover of romance. As for Rabelais, he“never escaped, nor wished to escape, out of the comfortable absurdity of theMiddle Ages.… The reformers and the common humanists rejected it all, or drovetheir lean and blasted cattle through the medieval fields and brought them outas poor as when they went in.” Andreae would not reject all that curious lore.On the contrary, he would recuperate as much as possible.There are certain obscure books that somehow manage to convey the promise of adeeper intelligibility to be found just beneath an illusory surface. Such wasthe likely effect made by the Fama and the Confessio upon a kindly disposedreader in the seventeeth century, as it remains for that reader today. Withapparently remarkable ease Andreae seemed to synthesize his orthodox butgenerous Lutheranism with a rich body of allusive myth and legend, all of itgathered and channeled through the imaginative exegesis of Gospel parables.The Fama FraternitatisThe very title Fama Fraternitatis begs for some prior comment. We can get abetter sense of the meaning of Fama by examining a few places in which the wordappears in the texts of the most celebrated classical poets whose texts becamefor the learned men of the Renaissance written authority akin to a second Bible.The word fama means something halfway between “rumor” (as personified inVirgil’s Aeneid) and “the written record” (as in Horace’s Ars poetica.) In hisArt of Poetry, Horace advances a general doctrine of artistic decorum orplausibility, beginning with the famous images of centaur and mermaid. “If apainter chose to join a human head to the neck of a horse,” he writes, “and tospread feathers of many a hue over limbs picked up now here, now there, so thatwhat is at the top a lovely woman ends below in a black and ugly fish”—who wouldnot laugh at such a grotesque composition? The license of fiction does notextend to implausibility: “Either follow fama, or invent something verisimilar”(aut fama sequere, aut sibi convenientia finge). Here fama pretty clearly means“the poetic tradition.” If you present us with an Achilles, he must be true tothe Achilles of Homer. Your Medea must be “fierce and unyielding,” as inEuripides.This is not to say that Achilles and Medea are not fictional characters. Thevery essence of classical fama is that it mingles truth and falsehood. The mostfamous personification of Fama is in Virgil’s Aeneid, in which she flies aboutLibya, spreading the fatal rumor of the incipient affair of Dido and Aeneas: “asconstant in her tales of baseless scandal as at time she is the herald of thetruth … with stories manifold, and facts and falsehoods side by sideproclaimed.” (iv, 174ff.) From these lines Ovid created a celebrated set pieceon “Fama’s house” (Metamorphoses xii, 39ff.), in which he quotes Virgil’s verywords. Within her great house, “the fickle vulgar come and go, and a thousandrumors, false mixed with true, wander up to fill the empty ears withconversation.” Chaucer, in his time, devoted a whole poem to the conceit: hisHouse of Fame.An accurate sense of Andreae’s title might be “An Announcement of the Foundationof the Brotherhood.” Its hardly modest ambitions are clarified in the largerGerman title. This is the announcement of a plan for “the Comprehensive andThorough-Going Reformation of the Whole Wide World,” addressed to “All theLearned People and the Leaders of Europe.” But it is the announcement of a planalready put into motion by a secret brotherhood already long established.images [../Images/p126.jpg]Heinrich Jung Stilling, an eminent oculist turned Christian mystic, was both aproduct of, and a defector from, the Age of Reason. He was for a time a kind ofguru to Julie de Krüdener. This page from his diary for August 1805 displays hisown “secret” handwriting, in part derived from kabbala and alchemical notation.Writers and scholars very frequently bemoan the untranslatability of a word orphrase before facing up to their duty actually to translate it. The macaronic(half Latin, half German) title of this remarkable book, which seems simpleenough until you make such an attempt, was Fama Fraternitatis dess löblichenOrdens des Rosenkreutzes—the “Fama” of the Praiseworthy Order of the Rosy Cross(or Rose-Cross). Colin Wilson, in his foreword to Christopher McIntosh’s veryreadable historical introduction, The Rosicrucians, seems aware of a possibledifficulty. He notes that McIntosh “translates ‘Fama’ as ‘declaration,’ but myown Latin dictionary defines it as ‘common talk … a report, rumour, saying,tradition.’ So it would be hardly unfair to translate ‘Fama’ as myth or legend.”In calling themselves a “mystical” order, the Rosicrucians were using the wordin an original sense that has become rare. What is mystical is what is hidden,and what is hidden can be found, or at least intelligently searched for. Suchwas the “mystical” sense of the Scriptures after which the medieval exegeteslabored. The quest for Enlightenment differed, therefore, from the appeal to ablind magic. It was a process strictly parallel to the procedures of scientificinvestigation that on all sides were yielding new discoveries in the realm ofNature. Most Masonic occultists doubtless regarded themselves as men of science.The sciences they pursued were not limited to physics, chemistry, and botany.They included alchemy, necromancy, haruspication, sex magic, and the raising ofthe dead. There was not much that one might find in ancient Carthage—or southernCalifornia in the sixties—that was not being pursued in one Masonic lodge oranother in the European Enlightenment.THE ROLE PLAYED BY the Rosicrucian Masons in eighteenth-century intellectual andpolitical life has been so thoroughly studied that one can find maximal claimsthat they caused the French Revolution or minimalist retorts that they didlittle more than distract the revolutionaries. On one point, however, there is abroad agreement: many Enlightenment Rosicrucians embraced some very weird ideasand pursued some bizarre spiritual quests. Pioneering work now half a centuryold, by the French historian René Le Forestier, has provided us with a greatdeal of detailed information about occult Freemasonry in France, and as we shallsee, the occultists were not limited to France. There is no black hole in all ofthe Enlightenment that is without its Rosicrucian quarks.Ordo Rosae Crucis means “the Order of the Rose-Cross” or “of the Rose of theCross,” or “of the Rosy [adjective] Cross,” all of which meanings appear inlater commentary and iconographic formulation. But the Rose Cross of the Fama isa man, the order’s eponymous founder, Brother Christian Rosenkreuz, usuallyindicated, like all the other specifically denominated brothers, by hisinitials. C.R. was the son of noble parents so reduced in their worldly fortuneas to place their young son in a monastery. After learning Latin and Greek“indifferently,” C.R. traveled with one of his brethren on pilgrimage to theHoly Land. The mentor died on Cyprus, but C.R. traveled on to Damascus. Feeblehealth kept him from ever making it to Jerusalem, but he nonetheless greatlyimproved his time in study. He mastered Arabic, allowing him to translate “theBook M.” into Latin. He then sojourned for a spell in Egypt, where his eruditionadvanced to even greater heights. C.R.’s is a biography to remember when readingCount Cagliostro’s autobiographical deposition before the court of the Parlementof Paris.A good deal of the Fama is given over to the development of the brotherhood’sprotocols within an historical context in which increments of socialorganization went hand-in-hand with a growth in wisdom. Furthermore, themotivation behind its proclamation is not less remarkable than the document’scontents. After all, the public announcement in five languages of the existenceand operations of a secret society might seem a paradoxical initiative. TheRosicrucian architects of this mystic field of dreams do not seem to haveembraced the hope that if they built it, they would come. It was more a case of“If we come, they will build it.” There was no return address in the printedcopies of the Fama, nor has any scholarly cryptographer yet found one in theobviously cryptic elements of its text—a failure not explicable on the groundsof any want of trying. The financing of the original “public offering,” whichcannot have been negligible, remains mysterious; nor do we have much informationabout the means by which the actual physical sheets were distributed.One cannot, however, argue with success, especially one so brilliant as thebirth of Rosicrucianism. Jesus had said, “Come unto me all ye who are heavyladen, and I will give you rest.” That has attracted, through history, a certaincrowd. “Come unto us,” said the Brothers of the Rosy Cross, “all ye who areenlightened or who seek enlightenment, all ye benign ones who seek to know thesecrets of Nature, to master the Book M., and to advance the well-being of yourfellow men.”What follows has been called in the history books “the Rosicrucian furore.” Theexcitement throughout Europe was intense. Searchers after truth looked high andlow through the great edifices of European erudition for the Brothers of theRosy Cross. A surprising number found them—in their mirrors.Rosicrucianism became “a circle whose center is everywhere and whosecircumference is nowhere”—or, occasionally, vice versa. This metaphor oftranscendental amplitude (usually applied to God, the cosmic order, Communism,or some other grand design) has been attributed to Alain de Lille, Rabelais,Pascal, and Nikolai Bukharin, among others; but it seems to have originated withthe thrice-great Hermes himself. It was, accordingly, an excellent fit for thebrothers and their shadowy order. And “order” (ordo) is indeed one of theself-referential monastic terms used by the Rosicrucians, another beingfraternitas (brotherhood).The Rosicrucian manifestos were a kind of religious proclamation. They did notannounce that the Kingdom of God was at hand, but the message was notdissimilar. What was at hand, indeed what was already established throughoutawakening Europe, were secret communities of a new kind of brotherhood, bound bya common search for the secrets of nature and the secrets of ancient wisdom, andunited in a grand altruistic design: the betterment of the human species and itsmodes of living. Like nascent Christianity, like pre-Lapsarian Communism, likecertain episodes of Victorian industrial and scientific optimism, theRosicrucian movement was animated by a powerful confidence barely touched by thecynicism bred of history. The Rosicrucian non-organization had the genius ofbeing a highly exclusive club, but whose members became members byself-election. If you read the Fama Fraternitatis and in it recognized yourself,why then you were already a Rosicrucian. All that needed to be done was tosearch out like-minded brethren.The secrecy surrounding Rosicrucianism was only in part stylistic, the logicalmode of procedure of men who sought occult knowledge. It was also, in most partsof Europe, a prudential necessity. Those who explicitly sought “the reform ofthe whole wide world” might easily encounter powerful political opposition of amost dangerous kind. It is in fact true that many of the secret revolutionarysocieties, including the German Illuminati, had Rosicrucian connections. Thegemlike flame of the hermetic idealism of Andreae and his generation could notfail to dim somewhat in the succeeding centuries, but its energy survived invarious institutional settings, and in particular in certain Masonic lodges. Tothem we shall now turn.BibliographicalPopular literature concerning Rosicrucianism is not hard to come by. Thereadable and the reliable present greater challenges. Fortunately the primarysources are readily available, as well as a number of outstanding secondaryworks.The original Rosicrucian manifestos are available in English in Paul Allen’sexcellent Christian Rosenkreutz Anthology (latest edition New York, 2008). TheBrotherhood of the Rosy Cross: A History of the Rosicrucians, by Arthur EdwardWaite, one of the greatest of modern esotericists, has been frequentlyrepublished (latest edition New York, 1993). Christopher McIntosh, TheRosicrucians: The History, Mythology, and Rituals of an Esoteric Order (latestedition San Francisco, 1998), is crisp and scholarly.An indispensable classic history is Frances Yates’s erudite RosicrucianEnlightenment (latest edition New York, 1992), for which her Occult Philosophyin the Elizabethan Age (1979), dealing with materials earlier than those thatappear in my book, is a most useful supplement.Readers seeking fuller bibliographical information may consult John WarwickMontgomery, Cross and Crucible: Johann Valentin Andreae (1586–1654), Phoenix ofthe Theologians, 2 vols.

Nevertheless, only the rashest of scholars would abandon Waite’sjudicious diffidence without the deepest misgivings.The principal difficulty concerning Masonic origins is that they are in partactual and historical but deeply obscure, and in part vivid but fanciful andlegendary. Both tendencies are of importance to the intellectual history of theEnlightenment period, but as a spurious certainty generally triumphs over honestconfusion, it has unfortunately proved easier to synthesize the two strands thanto purify or purge them. Hence the opinion of Frances Yates: “The origin ofFreemasonry is one of the most debated, and debatable, subjects in the wholerealm of historical inquiry.”To begin with the sometimes forgotten obvious, Freemasonry did originally havesomething to do with actual stonemasons, the men who built in stone. We oftencall them “stonecutters,” but that is a term that may fall short of the dignityof men whose capacities could be of a high artistic order. In the Middle Agesthe skills of lapidary workers were continuous with those of artists we wouldthink of as architects and sculptors. Medieval illustrations of masons at workoften show the stonecutting and the figural carving being conducted as a serialprocess. The mason’s skills might include—in addition to artisanalabilities—mathematical and geometrical knowledge of a high order, a mastery of amodern engineer’s knowledge of the strength of materials, and the visionarygenius of great architects. One of the medieval Latin terms for the architectwas marmorarius, the “marble expert.” The adjective “free” (with its parallelsin Latin and other early vernacular European texts) originally referred to thestone itself, “free” stone being the roughly cut blocks on their way to beingprepared as ashlar or stone blanks for the sculptor—stone ready to be put toconstructive use.As Freemasonry evolved and the elaborate web of its allegory grew ever stronger,interpretations of the stone, no less than of the tools used to work them,became increasingly complex. The stones were the Masons themselves. They beganas rough blocks fresh from the quarry. Masonic sociability and the quest forillumination razed their rough edges and planed their irregularities as theymoved through initiation and up the grades of Masonic advancement. The aim waslapidary perfection, the perfectly pumiced surface, the perfect fit. And here,again, an explicit biblical text is frequently cited, I Peter 2:5: “Youyourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be aholy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through JesusChrist.” The great Temple of Freemasonry, though allegorically betokened by theold stones once worked by Hiram of Tyre, was composed of “living stones.”Stonemasons, like other skilled craftsmen, had developed their own craft guildsin the Middle Ages; like most of the others, too, they claimed for their craft aunique prestige and antiquity. The craft guilds have been viewed as precursorsof modern labor unions, with which they did indeed share some similarities offunction and even of practice. But the labor union analogy is probably morevexatious than helpful. The old guilds were in some ways like social clubs andin others like trade schools. They were not entirely unlike political parties,or at least political clubs. Most of all, perhaps, did they resemble the oldreligious confraternities, with which in the Middle Ages they often had intimaterelationship. All skilled labor has its “secrets of the trade,” as we stillsay—specialized knowledge that to the uninitiated possesses an arcane ormysterious character. One particular masonic marvel was stereotomy: the skill ofcutting stones in complex shapes and precise tolerances required byarchitectural demand. There are to be found on the individual stones in manyancient and medieval buildings distinctive masons’ marks. Their purpose wasprobably practical—identification. They served as a device for the tallying ofthe work of individual stonecutters on the one hand, and provided a guide to theproper placement of finished stones on the other. But it is at least possiblethat the marks did indeed in some instances have the “enigmatical,”“symbolical,” or “mystical” meanings attributed to them from the earliesthistorians of Freemasonry. The word “trademark,” however, should be sufficientto remind us that the masons were not alone. Many trades had theirmarks—including carpentry and smithing in various metals—that could perhaps beregarded as mysterious or arcane.Certain other lore of the stonemasons had entered popular literary culture wellbefore the Age of Freemasonry. One popular legend, based in a muddled confusionbetween four stonemasons who had refused to build a stone idol for the emperorDiocletian and five recusant soldiers who refused incense to Aesculapius, wascalled the Quatuor Coronati—the Four Crowned [Martyrs]. Masonry was sometimesfancifully called the ars quatuor coronati—“the craft of the four crownedones”—and that name was adopted for some famous early lodges.These ancient and mythical stonemasons enjoyed church dedications and eventuallybecame the patron saints of the construction trades. They then survived theReformation to show up once again in some of the very earliest Masonicdocuments. Among the more curious of the early documents is a poem in lateMiddle English (British Library, MS Reg 17.A.I), perfectly awful from theliterary point of view but of priceless historical worth, for it is a virtualanthology of the mystical lore that would later become so important inFreemasonry. The four martyrswere as good masons as on earth shall go,Gravers, and image-makers they were also,For they were workmen of the best …The Scottish historian David Stevenson has offered one of the most plausibleaccounts of actual Masonic origins. His Origins of Freemasonry posits Scotlandas the locus of the emergence of the first Masonic lodges. The suggestion isperhaps particularly attractive both because of the importance that Scotlandwould certainly have for European Masonry generally and for the particulargenius of the Scottish Enlightenment. But it is also based in seriousdocumentary evidence that goes beyond parochial pride or patriotism. Three ofStevenson’s documents are particularly significant, for they show that so far aswe know, Scotland was (1) the first place in which the word “lodge” appears inits modern Masonic sense; (2) the first place in which lodge Masonry wasconnected “with specific ethical ideas expounded by the use of symbols”; and (3)the first place in which “non-operatives” (meaning men who were not actuallystonemasons) sought and received admission to a Masonic lodge.This third point is of especial significance. The Masonry of the Enlightenmentwould have little to do with the literal construction of stone buildings. It isfrom this period that we begin to speak of two kinds of “masons”—practical oroperative masons on the one hand, speculative masons on the other. The fact thatphilosophically inclined gentlemen were welcomed for membership in the earlyScottish lodges suggests, perhaps, that these were already conclaves in whichintellectual activity and the scientific spirit were present. For there wasindeed a good deal of “science” involved with the stonemason’s art. The samepoetic “charges” just cited above wax lyrical about the mathematical andgeometrical expertise required of its practitioners, and include an encomium ofEuclid as master mason.However, the evidence could just as easily suggest that the guildsmen werelooking for and welcomed augmented sources of financial support. If so, the newlodges would once again suggest a parallel with the religious orders of the endof the Middle Ages which, with greater or less degrees of spiritual integrity,sought out a broader social fraternity within the world. There are analogies tobe seen in the transformation of the nature and function of the ancientaristocratic ranks as they moved from the old, medieval, feudal world to theworld of early modernity.The transformation in “masonry” was dramatic but not abrupt. In Scotland,operative and speculative Masonry found a shared home in some of the Scottishlodges well into the eighteenth century. That is, they remained societies whosefunction was the regulation of the stonemason’s trade. Subsequently the rise ofFreemasonry became the decline of stonemasonry, so that for the purposes of thisbook it must be the allegorical rather than the utilitarian functions of trowel,square, and chipping adze that will concern us. That throughout Europe aspecialized trade guild should develop in a very short space of time into ahugely influential, international source of social, spiritual, and intellectualgrowth is really rather remarkable.There is no single or simple explanation of a matter so complex, but oneaspect—the relationship of Masonic ideals to traditional Christianity—must betouched upon. Freemasonry emerged in a world of Christian institutions, howevershaken or contested they may have become. One central tenet of the Masons, theircommitment to toleration, eloquently addressed the cultural exhaustion broughton by the disasters of the Wars of Religion. The “movement,” which focused inphilosophical fashion on broad ethical principles such as the two commandmentsof the New Law (love of God, love of neighbor), was essentially ecumenical. Itscommitment to tolerance was one of its most conspicuously “enlightened” aspects,and certainly the one that could finally attract to membership such a man asVoltaire.The benevolent and universalist ideals of Masonry could bridge many broad chasmsof the old society. There was a proto-democratic element in an organization thatexpanded a medieval trade guild by the addition of aristocratic sympathizers.While it plays but a small part in our story, it might be noted in passing thatMasonry contributed significantly also to the augmented social and intellectualopportunities afforded to women. Though many lodges coalesced around certainpolitical ideas, the sociability of Freemasonry often trumped party. EliasAshmole, whose private collection of antiquities would become the core oftoday’s great Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, was a royalist and a churchman. Hefought for King Charles and with King Charles was defeated. All civil wars havetheir particular poignancy. An index of this one is the fact that Ashmole’sson-in-law, Colonel Henry Mainwaring, was a prominent Roundhead military man.Yet both son-in-law and father-in-law, the latter in effect the prisoner of theformer, were initiated into one of the northern English lodges at the same time.THE MOST OBVIOUS CHASM, that which had divided Christendom at the time of theReformation, was in a certain sense the most easily bridged. Despite theparticular status of religion as established by law in any particular Europeanarea, the Masonic lodge was often a place in which Catholics and Protestantsamicably mixed. William Schaw, who played a key role in the formation ofScottish Masonry, was a Roman Catholic. So was an early master of the GrandLodge in London. Numerous members of the Jacobite party were committed Masons.It must have been with shock and dismay, therefore, that many Masons would havereacted to the bull of Pope Clement XII (1738), which forbade entry into a lodgeupon pain of excommunication.The Pope’s reasoning, which seemed less than inexorable to many of the faithful,was double-pronged. Masonic secrecy showed that the brothers could not possiblybe up to any good. Moreover, the fact that so many of them “hated the light”(i.e., were not Catholics) proved that they were carnal sinners of aparticularly noxious stamp. In many parts of Europe the bull went unenforced.But of course it was rigorously applied in the papal states in Italy, in Iberia,and in some of the other darker crannies of Christendom. A lodge of IrishCatholic expatriates in Lisbon were astonished to find themselves suddenly indire need of justification before the Inquisition. Though one hears of manyimportant Catholic Masons in France and Germany throughout the eighteenthcentury, the bull was the prelude to what in essence became total war in thenineteenth century.The mutual hostility between papal Catholicism and Freemasonry became soarticulate in the European Age of Revolutions and later in the great Americanimmigration that we are likely to regard it as an historical inevitability. Ifso, the inevitability probably flowed from the British political situation ofthe seventeenth century. Here the two factors were the religious dimensions ofthe “Glorious Revolution” of 1688, and the French connections of the Jacobites.Whatever the precise circumstances surrounding Masonry’s “Scottish origins” maybe, the English lodges, and especially the Great Lodge of London, inevitablyplayed a major “missionary” role in the transmission of “Scottish rite” Masonryto the Continent, and especially to France. Among European liberals generally,the “British liberties” secured in their Protestant settlement of 1688 wereinspiring goals. To the degree to which Masonry could be thought of as Englishand Catholicism a threat to British liberties—as in the Gordon Riots of 1780—theclash was inevitable. The maladroit and ineffectual support of the Bourbonmonarchy for the lost cause of the Jacobites was a second factor. The researchof the French historian André Kervella, who has written extensively onFranco-Scottish Masonic connections in the eighteenth century, has suggestedthat more accommodating possibilities might have existed among Catholics. Amonghis books is a biography of Alan Michael Ramsay (1686–1743), better known as theChevalier Ramsay, a Scottish expatriate in France, a Catholic convert, a pretendaristocrat in the Pretender’s nobility, a prolific writer, and a key figure inthe Masonry of his age.What might be called Roman Catholic “Freemason envy” eventually led in theUnited States to the formation of the Knights of Columbus, a group that wasquite successful in America and enjoyed as much international success as itsAmerican origins would allow. Yet Freemasonry, with all its elaborate regaliaand ceremonial, allowed enlightened Europe to indulge in a certain degree ofunacknowledged Catholic nostalgia.Freemasonry was not a religion, at least not at the creedal level. The singledogmatic assent demanded of its members was a belief in “the Great Architect ofthe Universe.” That was almost universally accepted like any other apparentlyempirical fact, such as the rising and setting of the sun or the gradual changeof the seasons. A point perhaps deserving of repetition is that while dogmatictheology recoiled in broad retreat before the Enlightenment, it was very rarelyreplaced by dogmatic atheism. Yet for most Masons the experience of Masonry wasindeed very much like the experience of Christianity in its social and corporatedimensions.Religious history has often tended to exaggerate the question of belief at theexpense of the question of lived social experience. Orthodox Christianity,whether Catholic or Protestant, maintained a belief in the hypostatic union (thedoctrine that Jesus Christ was both true man and true God). Surely few ideas aremore theoretical or coolly intellectual. Yet commitment to a belief in thehypostatic union had been arrived at in the early Church only at theconsiderable cost of bitter and sometimes bloody debates, schisms, persecutions,and the shaking of the foundation of the civil state. Nobody could say thehypostatic union was not important. Still, it is difficult to conceive that thefelt experience of Old World Christians had much or anything to do with theirshared “belief” in a theological conundrum. The essence of their experience wasin shared liturgy and shared sacraments, and yet more perhaps in those deeplysocial pleasures of shared human community that one would instinctively label“secular” did they not happen to take place in or around a church building or ata “religious” festival or pilgrimage.Many men found exactly the same communal pleasures in Freemasonry. For manyChristians among them, it is obvious from contemporary writers, Freemasonry wasa kind of annex to or augmentation of their old religious life. For many others,it was a surrogate more or less self-consciously acknowledged. It does notdisparage the intellectual importance of eighteenth-century Freemasonry toacknowledge the primacy of its more modest sociability.GENERAL ACCOUNTS OF THE EFFECTS of the Protestant Reformation in northern Europeoften stress the hostility of the Reformers to many aspects of the old Catholicreligion regarded as “vain” (ineffectual), “superstitious,” or “idolatrous.”Only a part of the hostility was strictly speaking doctrinal in a limited sense,but it was broadly so to the degree that it was founded in a particular view ofthe sacramental system, which is to say in the relationship between outwardforms and inward meanings. One very conspicuous manifestation is the iconoclasmcharacteristic to one degree or another of all reforming movements. Often it wasextreme. In veritable orgies of destruction, religious vandals in parts of theLow Countries destroyed in a few weeks the precious glass and stone images, thepious ornamentation created at large expense by three centuries of Gothicreligion. In England, the fury against “idols” was often hardly less violent,and the supposed Elizabethan “settlement” proved actually to be the prelude toprotracted Puritan restiveness and a bloody civil war.A revolution of political form can be imposed by force. A revolution in socialforms and practices can be achieved by dictation. Ancient titles of socialstation might yield to citoyen or tovarish; the traditional names of the monthsof the ancient calendar could for a time be changed by decree. But mental andsociological change is often of a different sort. Among recent studies byscholars of the Reformation period in Europe such as Eamon Duffy are severalthat have modified or challenged some of the older and starker accounts ofquestions that once seemed happily settled into historical consensus. Oneparticular question has been that of partial or covert continuity of certainfeatures of the old popular piety and pious practice. Old habits of the heart donot surrender easily before even the harshest opposition. Witness thesurprisingly feeble achievements of several decades of robust anti-religiouspropaganda in Bolshevik Russia. Aspects of the old religious system were sodeeply embedded in social life as to be in effect indelible.Two of these are of particular relevance to the history of Freemasonry. One ofthem was organizational. Though Catholicism was by definition universal in itsclaims, it had distinct local manifestations in diocesan and parish structures.It also had local centers of divergent spiritual emphasis and practice, andsometimes even of belief, in the religious orders. For many scholars, one of theleast accountable aspects of the Reformation was the comparative ease with whichthe religious orders, which despite conspicuous failures and corruptions had forhundreds of years been the dynamos of pious practice and spiritual vitality,were everywhere cashiered from the Reformed churches. In the light of thisreality, one prominent feature of Freemasonry throughout the Protestant North isits numerous parallels, both in terms of structure and in terms of secondarysocial function, to the old religious houses.A second aspect relevant to an understanding of the Masons was the ancient anduniversal habit of and appetite for ritual, ceremony, and spectacle. In themedieval Church, ceremony had of course been everywhere. The supposed etymologyof the word “liturgy” is “work of the people,” or work undertaken on thepeople’s behalf. Many Reformers believed that in its elaborations it in fact hadbecome yet another idolatrous, man-made barrier between the individual Christianand God. Certainly, Christian ritual had a large element of spectacle. The mostfundamental ceremony of the Church, the mass, was a kind of drama to beperformed with various levels of elaboration and expansion, often with music.The mass was always the same, yet ever different. At its core was an unchangingcanon, or fixed core, which within any given sacramental celebration would besupplemented by “propers”—elements particular to the specific occasion, season,function, or votive intention. Once again the universal and the timelessexpressed itself in local and temporal form. The participants in the drama worespecial clothing, made artificial and allegorical gestures, moved about in asacred space that had long since been minutely allegorized as the geography ofanother, spiritual world.More or less elaborate ceremony attended every stage of the Christian’s life: atthe baptismal font, at the church gate (where marriages were performed), at thebier from which the dead body was translated to the grave. And the privateceremonies and rituals were the least part of it. Religious ritual, often of amost splendid and impressive nature, was everywhere in the Old World. There weresumptuous parades through the city streets and town squares; there were alsorogation processions through the agricultural fields. In the cities of earlymodern Europe the observance of one summertime festival, Corpus Christi Day,took on many of the features of a modern county fair or grand industrialexhibition, where wealthy burghers lined the route of procession by laying outfor display their finest vestments, jewelry, and household plate.The sacred and the secular were so thoroughly intertwined that even the mostthorough “cleansing” of religious ritual necessarily left a vast body of civicritual untouched. Sacred space forcibly vacated seldom stayed long unoccupied.This was true even in such a violent revolution as that of the Bolsheviks. Theycould destroy, deface, or forbid the old sacred spaces of Russian Orthodoxy; butjust look at any photograph of a Moscow May Day and you will see the grimiconostasis of the Politburo lineup.The ritual and ceremonial of Freemasonry provided in the Protestant lands, asamong the less devout elements of some of the Catholic ones, a welcomeopportunity openly to beautify the pursuit of high moral purpose with thegarments of allegory. When Kant enunciated the famous Enlightenmentprinciple—Sapere aude, Dare to know!—he made explicit acknowledgment of theaudacity of knowledge itself. Yet even an exhortation to audacity could be madein a spirit of inner diffidence that for the most part our own age has ignored,forgotten, or abandoned. The first requirement of the would-be magus wasreverence. So also was the first requirement of the Mason in his approach to the“Great Architect.”The face of God was a kind of Gorgon’s head, to be viewed if at all only by theindirection of mirrored reflections or the oblique glance. God Himself had toldMoses of old: “Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me andlive.” (Ex 33:20) He gave His prophet but a glimpse of His hinder parts. “And itwill come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft ofthe rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by; and I will take awaymy hand, and thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be seen.”(22–23) The contemporary mind prosecutes its search for the truths of Nature ina manner it believes to be bold and direct. The mind of the Old World found itdecorous to conduct the search with the aid of a great deal of what we arelikely to think of as mumbo-jumbo.A “Secret” SocietyThe first distinctive feature of Freemasonry was its clandestine nature.Membership in the brotherhood was to be a secret, and one to be guarded asclosely as circumstances would allow. This aspect of the Masonic project wasclearly so important to the Masons that they were willing to pay a steep pricefor it. Masonic secrecy was at the root not merely of the papal prohibition butof all the other suspicions of conspiracy that have brooded in dark cumulus overthe lodges for the last three centuries. The Masons were by no means the firstsecret society, but they soon became so prominent and influential as to becomethe paradigm for most others. That is the conclusion of one comparative study ofthe structure and rites of the literally dozens of secret societies that sprangup with nearly fungal growth throughout the period of the Enlightenment and theRevolutions.There was in the clandestine protocols a thematic unity binding together theancient ideas of “the secrets of the trade,” a secrecy influenced by economicconcern, and ideas of occult, esoteric, or simply “scientific” knowledgeavailable only to the worthy, the industrious, and the instructed. Here there isa perfect congruence with what is usually taken to be the essential project ofEnlightenment. These men like the sages of all times sought the pearl of wisdom;and pearls were not to be cast before swine. We may think of Masonic secrecy asan obvious instrument of elite exclusivity, but Masons themselves might regardit as spiritual obligation.Even in the earliest Scottish documents there are references to what is calledthe “Mason word,” as in password. The Mason word was a secret sign by which aMason might make known his status to a fellow Mason. This “word” (in fact signsof various kinds) was meant to include the right people and exclude the wrongones. It might be the deadly shibboleth of the twelfth chapter of the Book ofJudges. It might be the common English words “bread” and “cheese,” fatallyunpronounceable by the Flemings of Kent in 1381. It could be simply theidentifying “sign” of a particularly cohesive group. Many medievalorganizations, including institutions of religious life, had a “word.” TheFranciscan Rule, for example, prescribed a “Franciscan word.” Upon entering anyedifice the friar must say Pax huic domui—“Peace be unto this house.”The particular feature of the Mason word was its secret nature. By now the Masonword has been betrayed, exposed, revealed, confessed, or videotaped on YouTubewith sufficienct frequency to demonstrate that there was no such thing as theMason word. That may have been true from the very beginning. In fact, the wordwas seldom actually a word. It could be any conventional sign (gesture, item ofattire, detached emblem, etc.) of semiotic utility. No one who has read hisjustly famous translation of Rabelais is likely to suppose that Thomas Urquhartof Cromarty was a man easily flummoxed by verbal semiotics. In 1653 in hisequally amazing Logopandecteision, devoted to his universal-language hobbyhorse,this Scotch warrior-savant recorded a cryptic anecdote of men able to makesignificant communication the one to another without the use of words or anyother visible signs. That this was an eyewitness account of the Mason word inaction has been doubted by some who have not found his name inscribed in therecords of any of the early Scottish lodges; but even in the unlikely event of abird of a different feather, this one is quacking very like a duck.The Mason word was one of many covert or coded signals by which men have soughtsince time immemorial to communicate privately through the use of a closelyguarded semiotic system. During the Depression in the United States, itineranthobos are supposed to have left signs decipherable only to other itinerant hobosindicating a house at which they might receive a handout. Recent studies in “gaysemiotics” have claimed to detail with a possibly alarming specificity the codedmeaning of red and blue bandanas, or the placement of visibly worn keychains.Though it was not the first of secret societies, the Masonic Order soon becameby far the largest; and the Mason word is the obvious ancestor of the revelatorygestures and secret handshakes characteristic of the dozens of secret societiesthat came to birth in the nineteenth century, continuing today in suchorganizations as the Greek letter fraternities and sororities. Most fraternalgrips of the academic Hellenes lack the “fiendish simplicity” of the Masonicword, requiring such complicated feats of youthful digital dexterity as to beunperformable by those elders still capable of remembering them.Masonic secrecy has been the chief cause of the suspicion and hostility withwhich the order has often been regarded. Even in early Scotland, it suffered theopprobrium of unfounded accusations of malign conspiracy. For a couple ofcenturies the Masons and the Jesuits between them maintained a near monopoly onthe multitude of supposed conspiracies that crowded the European mind. TheJesuits in their decline gave way to The Jews, often enough aligned with TheMasons. Within the last decade there was a public controversy in Londonconcerning the police. The fear was that police officers who were Masons mightbe required by their secret oaths of mutual allegiance to aid criminals whohappened to be Masons.But if secrecy brought with it potential liabilities, these were outweighed byits assets. Among them was a partly manufactured solidarity of companionship ina shared and noble cause, as well as a sense of exclusive election that seems tobe a universal appetite of human nature. Furthermore, it did provide the Masonswith at least one genuine mystery that could be revealed to initiates. Nobodyelse had this secret knowledge, for they had thought it up themselves. Men likePasquilly, Saint-Martin, or Cagliostro might speak of “secret doctrines.” Inactual fact there were no secret doctrines. There was instead the aspiration toseek enlightenment secretly, and for purposes of enunciating this pursuit, thenof prosecuting it, they did indeed find secret words, signs, symbols, and rites.The darkest secret of the Masons was that there was no secret, a truth thatCasanova, among several of his equally distinguished brethren, makes explicit.“Those who undertake to become Masons for no other reason than to learn the‘secret’ can find themselves mistaken, for you can live fifty years as a masterMason without ever penetrating the secret of the brotherhood,” he wrote. “Thesecret of Masonry is inviolable by its very nature, because the Mason who knowsit knows it only by intuition. He didn’t learn it from anybody. He discovered itby means of time spent at the lodge, in observing, in reasoning, in deducing …The secret will therefore remain always secret.”What Casanova has in mind, surely, is that the essence of Freemasonry is anexperiential process, a gradual movement toward moral amelioration and towardspiritual and intellectual enlightenment. The process is in the secular spherethe obvious analogue to the old Christian aspiration to “perfection,” thoughCasanova himself takes his analogy not from medieval but from antiqueasceticism. He likens the thirst of “outsiders” for the Masonic secret to thatof the old “profanes” with regard to the ancient Eleusinian Mysteries of thecult of Demeter. What “profane” originally meant was that person or thingexcluded from the fanum, the temple. The French Masons soon began to use theword profane to denote those who had not yet undergone initiation—theMasonically unbaptized.The secrecy was at least in a general way consistent with ancient guildpractice, which also did offer an actual template for the initiation rites.Although they developed considerably over the course of the eighteenth century,these rites seem from our earliest documents to have been already ratherelaborate. The grades or “degrees” of Masonry multiplied, but they were foundedin the tripartite divisions of old guild life, and their conception isilluminated by medieval practice. The skilled craftsman began as an apprentice,moved on to become a journeyman, and might hope finally to arrive at the statusof master.The very names have much to teach us. Apprenticeship (from French apprendre, “tolearn”) is an elementary stage of practical tuition. The apprentice was a manengaged in “on-the-job training,” as we now say. Apprenticeship was ideally anintimate and familial relationship, not simply a temporary union of employer andwage earner. In the very important guild statutes drawn up by William Schaw, theScottish Master of the King’s Works in the latter part of the sixteenth century,no master should have more than three apprentices during the course of a workinglifetime. However, once apprenticeship had been completed, usually according toa fixed time period agreed in advance by formal contract, the minimum periodbeing seven years, the guildsman advanced to the status of journeyman. That is,he now left the shop of the master under whom he had undertaken training and,formally credentialed by his guild, could seek work in other shops with othermasters. There is an ambiguity in the word “journey” that is carried over into“journeyman.” A “journey” (day’s worth) could be both a unit of travel and aunit of work. Certain trades, among which that of the mason was conspicuous,often demanded a supply of itinerant workmen, just as many of the constructiontrades still do. A single large undertaking—a cathedral, for instance—mightoccupy the entirety of a mason’s life. Other jobs—the repair of churches or ofcivic buildings, the building of bridges, and so on—would require considerablyless time. The third and highest grade was that of the master, though of courseby no means did all journeymen achieve it. The word still bore the full force ofthe Latin magister—a teacher, a man so advanced in the art as to be trusted topass it on to a new generation of apprentices. Our word “masterpiece,” which nowmeans any achievement of extraordinary quality, once referred to the actualphysical artifact—in wood, paint, stone, precious metal—that gave tangible proofof the workman’s having arrived at the acme of his skill.These were the hierarchical grades of guild organization that provided thetemplate of Masonic organization. But before moving toward the actual Masonicrites, it is useful to recall the ways in which the secular organization ofmedieval guild life echoed or paralleled certain long-established sacred forms.The first of these was structural: the clerical orders within the Church. Thereare three major orders of Catholic ministry: diaconate, priesthood, andepiscopacy. Though the analogy is not exact, it is still significant. Theservile status of the deacon is indicated even in the name. The bishop is theone with the power and authority to ordain the lower orders of ministry.It was inevitable that this scheme would frequently be related explicitly to theTrinitarian theology of which it was born. In psychological terms, the threestages often took the names of purgation, illumination, and union. The purgativestage emptied by ascetic practice the carnal distractions of the carnal man. Theilluminative stage let light pour into the empty spaces now after such greatlabors spiritually cleansed. The unitive stage brought the seeker to his finalgoal, God “in himself.” These stages often are described in other terms, onevery common trinity being initiation, progression, and perfection.This is not to say that the craft hierarchy of the old masons was in some simplesense a secular adaptation of the old monastic steps of perfection. Rather, thecongruence reflects something more comprehensive, a general pattern of thoughtthat throughout the Middle Ages often blurred distinctions between the sacredand the secular. By the late mendicant period, the fraternal orders had greatlyexpanded the concept of membership in a religious order through the constructionof lay sodalities and the issuance of letters of confraternity. It will surpriseno one familiar with the nature of the medieval confraternities to findconfraternal features in the trade guilds of the Renaissance that demonstrateexplicitly Christian, even liturgical elements. As already mentioned, the oldestsurviving documents of Scottish Freemasons are a varied group of manuscriptscalled the Old Charges. They pretty well span the period of the transition fromoperative to speculative Masonry. Typically they contain more or less detailedinstructions concerning the organization of actual practitioners of thestonemason’s craft. But they also continue the convention, undoubtedly ofmedieval origin, of prefacing the document with a Trinitarian prayer, a petitionfor illumination.The initiation ceremonies of the eighteenth century are known from a rich bodyof literary and iconographic evidence. They varied widely in elaboration ofform, and to a certain extent even in content, throughout the wide areas ofEurope through which the Masons rapidly spread. But certain themes and elements,the fundamental ones, are constant. We do not have a fully documented “playbook”for the ceremony of initiation of the early Scottish lodges, but an outline canbe easily enough deduced. Initiation required a dramatic mise-en-scène of animpressive nature, achieved through staged alternation of light and dark, soundand silence. The candidate, who was led into the chamber of initiationblindfolded or in deep obscurity, was required, often repeatedly, to petitionfor admission. He was required to identify himself as a sincere and voluntarycandidate who aspired to the benefits but also the responsibilities of fraternalmembership. He was required to make a formal oath that he would reveal nothingthat he had seen or heard within the initiation chamber to anyone outside it.Everything was made to be as spooky and threatening as possible. One of theearliest surviving catechisms prescribes that the candidate should be“frightened with 1000 ridiculous postures and grimaces.” Yet all this was to bedone with considerable solemnity.There were many stage props and considerable dramatic or liturgical action.Elements of the process paralleled the initiatory sacrament of Christianbaptism, the chief symbolic elements of which are ceremonial purification andparticipation in Christ first through death and then through Resurrection. Themajor liturgical action was a movement from darkness to light, the symbolism ofthe Easter vigil and, in a much wider sense, the central “comic” plot ofChristian art, as in Dante’s Commedia, which begins with a man lost in a darkwood and ends with him dazzled before the Beatific Vision imagined as a sea oflight. This movement was emblematized in the initiation ceremony by the removalof an occluding blindfold or the introduction into a darkened chamber ofnumerous lights. Light imagery was prominent in many aspects of the initiationceremony. The candidate was asked whether in truth he sought the “true light,” aterm loaded with the weight of the distinction between John the Baptist andJesus Christ in the Prologue to the Gospel of John, the so-called last gospel ofthe mass. “He [John] was not himself the light; he came to bear witness to thelight. The true light which enlightens every man was even then coming into theworld.” The necessary promise to “seek enlightenment” was often symbolized bybringing the candidate before a huge candle, the size of the Paschal light, inan otherwise empty room.Rapid Spread of the Scottish RiteDavid Stevenson draws attention to the “bewildering speed” with which thetransformation of Scottish Masonry from operative to speculative, once begun,was accomplished. The rapid transformation of trade guild to secret benevolentsociety involved both geographical expansion and demographic and social changein membership. Lodges appeared in profusion throughout the towns of theLowlands.In one sense both strands of membership—that is the “operatives” and the“speculatives”—can be said to have increased, and to have done so in a fashionthat anticipated those comparatively democratic aspects of Masonry that wouldprove characteristic on the Continent as well. Stevenson considered theambiguity of the word “operative.” Did it mean only a practicing stonemason, ormight it be a more generic term for a craftsman (paralleling Shakespeare’s“rude” mechanical)? Certainly the seventeenth century witnessed the appearancein the lodges of the aristocratic element that would be such a marked feature ofEuropean Masonry. The lodges welcomed as members “gentlemen masons,” who were byno means manual workers of any sort, and often even enjoyed aristocraticpatronage. But there is evidence that some skilled laborers who were not workersin stone now became Masons as well. In other words, Scottish Freemasonry wasexpanding its ancient “proletarian” base even as it was attracting anincreasingly genteel membership.There was another important structural way in which the expansion of Masonrymimicked that of the old religious orders: the system of filiations (from filia,“daughter”) by which a “mother house” expanded its mission by colonization. Thepattern of growth in the religious houses of the later Middle Ages is mostclearly illustrated by the Cistercians. This famous order of reformedBenedictines took its popular name from the founding Abbey of Càteaux inBurgundy. By constitutional statute, Càteaux remained the “mother” of numerousother abbeys that soon sprang up around it; and it remained the “mother” evenwhen some of them had clearly surpassed it in numbers, prestige, and wealth.A system of filiation was almost naturally adopted by the Freemasons in theirearly and rapid expansion. However, schematic, hierarchical subordination neverbecame a permanent feature of Masonry; and soon enough the adjective “free,”detached from its original connotations of prepared quarry stone, was taken asapplying to the independence of voluntary association within the individuallodges. Yet the somewhat ambiguous and troubled relationship frequentlycharacteristic of the “families” of the old religious life continued in thecompetition among lodges. At the same time, considerable social and spiritualimportance accompanied the prestige of a “mother lodge.” Sometimes members froma founding lodge made formal inspections of their “daughter” lodges. These menwere in some ways the analogues of the old monastic “visitors,” whose role wasto invigilate moral laxness and encourage a general uniformity of ceremonialpractice.IT IS OF CONSIDERABLE interest that at the time of the so-called Great Schism inthe Church of the fourteenth century, which witnessed a credible rivalry ofclaimants to the papacy, the religious orders, by their very natureinternational or extranational, nonetheless adopted the royal policy of the kingin whose territory they held their lands. At a time of increasingly assertivenational sensibility, nascent Freemasonry likewise had the awkwardness ofnegotiating the conflict of abstract and universal philosophical aspiration withthe more mundane realities of national politics. In England and France theresoon appeared claimants to be the “national” lodge. In France, the claimant tonational supremacy was the “Grand Orient,” which was organized in the early1770s, but its pretensions were resisted by several of the “mother lodges” ofthe provinces. The title “Grand” was lavishly applied to individual Masonicofficers as well as to whole lodges, but of course there was no pope ofFreemasonry with a recognized universal authority. A great deal of the vast bodyof amateur history that has issued from the lodges for the last century and ahalf is largely engaged, not to say obsessed, with questions of antiquity,priority of foundation, and various other controversies involving the order’sspiritual capital.But though the lodge “system” evolved with a chaos that severely challenges thesocial historian, it proved wonderfully apt in fostering Masonry as one of themost significant social and intellectual institutions of the Enlightenment. Anew lodge could be established with relative ease. This was particularly true inEngland, where as early as the sixteenth century a fairly elaborate network ofmale sociability was already in place. The world that gave birth to thegentleman’s club, the coffeehouses, and the gambling hells was one that provedparticularly genial to the Masons. Many of the English lodges were in factgroups of like-minded friends who met on a scheduled basis in a reserved room inone of the taverns. Such a lodge could be born one day and perish—usually byamalgamation with another, but sometimes through simple atrophy—another. Thereare dozens of early European lodges of which we know no more than a name, andthat only because of some kind of documentary fluke. It is natural to draw theinference that there were many fugitive lodges that disappeared altogether.The self-appointed “Grand Lodge” of England was founded in London in 1717through the amalgamation of four of the public house lodges, made up, for themost part, of actual stonemasons and other construction “operatives,” thoughaugmented in the Scottish fashion with some gentlemen. These lodges hadpreviously enjoyed the hospitality of such picturesque hostelries as theGoose-and-Gridiron and the Rummer-and-Grapes. In fact, a kind of jockeying forprestige and authority among a chaos of independent lodges was a feature ofMasonry throughout Europe—what might be called “grandness envy.” The “GrandLodge,” having successfully achieved a status of primus inter pares by mereproclamation, actually did very quickly acquire the wealth and prestige ofuniversal recognition. The Grand Lodge of England flourished under theleadership of two non-comforming foreigners, the Scots Presbyterian divine JamesAnderson and the émigré Huguenot pastor Jean-Théophile (John Theophilus)Desaguliers. These men had considerable influence in constructing what wasalmost a formal missionary project of spreading their Freemasonry in France.Just as the coffeehouses often became associated with a particular politicaltendency or party, or with a specialized intellectual interest or enthusiasm(mathematics, or chess, for example), so also did the small lodges frequentlyacquire an articulate “personality.” Many lodges were founded on specificintellectual principles in place a priori. In others they developed naturallyfrom the mental congruence of the founders.The question of the relation between politics and Masonry has been endlesslydebated, especially as regards the history of the French Revolution. There is nodoubt that Masonry was among the great circulatory systems of progressive andradical ideas in the eighteenth century, for like the academies it had beenconstructed as an arena of thought. But if Jean-Paul Marat was a Mason, so alsowere Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, the most profound of the philosophicalenemies of the Revolution in Britain and in France respectively.Individual lodges fostered actual personality as well. Since anyone with money,influence, or charisma might be able to found a lodge, Masonic organizationoffered certain attractive possibilities to a man of ambition, whether thatambition was sacred or profane. There are numerous examples of “serial”founders. Count Cagliostro was one such. He went farther than most by alsointroducing his own elaborate ceremonial rite: the Egyptian.The eighteenth century witnessed throughout many parts of Europe a rapid rise inthe frequency of business and cultural travel. (It would be a stretch to use theword “recreational” of even the best-sprung wheeled vehicles of the day.)Bankers, diplomats, lawyers, and whole army regiments moved about with a newvigor. No English gentleman could pretend to call himself educated withouthaving completed the Grand Tour. In this world the rapid filiations from motherlodges provided obvious channels for the transmission and spread of ideas as inearlier centuries the hospitality of religious houses and the itinerantacademies had once done. Indeed, the lodges were in part consciously intended toserve such a purpose, to serve as a spiritual conduit no less than asintellectual safe houses. The emissaries who had been sent out from the GreatLodge of London were in fact proto-missionaries, and their philosophical zealwas that of all apostles and missionaries.Just as a great talker like Ben Jonson or Samuel Johnson might bring eminence byhis presence to a London tavern or coffeehouse, so an eminent philosopher,mathematician, musician, or chess player might bring fame to his lodge. Onefamous example was the “mystic” Jean-Baptiste Willermoz (1730–1824), whosevoluminous correspondence brought a reflected glory to the Freemasons of Lyonamong whom he lived for decades. The historian René le Forestier devoted threethick and erudite volumes to the role played by Masons like Willermoz and hiscircle in the formulation and transmission of occult ideas.Numerous individual lodges have distinguished histories of their own. One suchwas the Parisian lodge called the Neuf Soeurs—the “Nine Sisters,” referring tothe Nine Muses. The name had been chosen to suggest the elevated artistic andintellectual tone of the conclave. It played a certain role in American history,as it had an influential role in garnering French support for the Americanrevolutionaries. The internationalism of French Freemasonry is illustrated bythe fact that both Benjamin Franklin and John Paul Jones were admitted to theNeuf Soeurs lodge, and Franklin became for a time its master.Allegories of a Secular ReligionAlready in the most ancient Scottish Masonic documents—the so-called OldCharges—we find that Masonic “teaching” advances through an allegoricalunderstanding of the actual tools of the trade. The Masonic emblem parexcellence was and is the heraldic device in which the concavity of the trysquare intersects with that of the opened compass; but every other conceivablemason’s tool would be allegorized as well. Once again, incidentally, the habitparallels that of the old ecclesiastical life, in which all the priestlyvestments and church furniture had by the end of the Middle Ages arrived atconventionally accepted allegorical meanings. Stone subjected to geometry wasthe essence of the art. Anyone who has ever examined a dollar bill knows thetriangulated all-seeing eye placed above the stone pyramid. This is a secularversion of the Masonic emblem in which the divine implication was made explicitin the letter G—for God, of course.The world would little note or long remember another amateur encyclopedia ofMasonic iconography, but one point not always made in the dozens already extant,namely, the obvious connections between “Masonic mysticism” and medievalscriptural exegesis, is worth both noting and remembering. Many of the earlyMasonic manuscripts speak of the “three pillars” of the lodge. These are thecompass, the square, and the Bible. They often appear also in pictorial form.Neither the compass nor the try square is an actual biblical verbal image,though both had made their appearance in biblical iconography, in depictions ofthe Creation, where Christ (the Creation having been, following the Johannineprologue, accomplished by the Son) works with one or the other in laying out thegrand design. In the eighteenth century, William Blake famously called the Bible“the Great Code of Art.” What he meant by that was that the Bible was theiconographical or symbolic encyclopedia of European painting and poetry. TheBible was likewise the great code of Masonic art.In the most general sense the meaning of the tripartite emblem is the orderingof the works of man within the divine economy. The Bible, which is the basisupon which man’s work is to be erected, is the revelation of the Word of God. Itis of course supreme. The compass “belongs” to the master of the lodge, who ischarged with the general supervision of its moral geography. The square“belongs” to the individual Mason, and its allegory speaks of the need todelimit and regulate his deportment with regard to other brethren. As in manyearly etymological allegories, much could be and was made of the derivatives ofLatin rectus (“straight,” “upright,”) and regula (“straight edge,” “ruler”):erect, correct, rectitude, regulate, etc.The allegorization of the mason’s trade among the old “operatives” is moreremarkable for its comprehensive nature than for its novelty. Medieval biblicalexegetes had for centuries lavished their attentions on the mystical meaning ofthe architecture of King Solomon’s palace, and more important yet, his Temple:its mathematical proportions, its furniture, and its decorations. The exegeticaltradition, so long established and so richly documented, proved to be a goldmine for the “speculatives.” A text of cardinal importance was the seventhchapter of the first Book of Kings, which provided an historical account of theconstruction and an inventory of the Temple’s contents. This scriptural sitebecame the source of much Masonic legend and symbolic iconography.The account of the stonework is quite detailed, and it emphasizes not only thepreciousness of the stone used but also the care of its preparation and theexpertise of its placement. It almost reads like an account written by astonemason for other stonemasons. It also celebrates by name a particularartisan: Hiram of Tyre. “Now King Solomon invited and received Hiram from Tyre …he was full of skill, intelligence, and knowledge in working bronze. He came toKing Solomon, and did all his work.” (I Kings 7:13–14) The exegeticallegerdemain by which an expert in molten metals is silently transformed into astonemason can be easily imagined. In fact this Hiram became for the Masons thelegendary founder of all useful trades, whether artisanal or metaphysical.Every aspect of Hiram’s wonderful manufacture for Solomon’s sacred compound isexpounded at some length in one or another Masonic commentary, but the “twopillars” had a special philosophical status. Outside the Temple gate, Hiramerected two pillars. Most biblical archaeologists assume that they werefree-standing and decorative rather than structural. “And he set up the pillarsat the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the namethereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereofBoas.” (7:21) These became the “J and B” in the Masonic lodges of the eighteenthcentury, sometimes literally (as architectural features) but always spirituallyor emblematically. To the diversity of exertion that the medieval exegetes haddevoted to the theme, the “mystical” Masons added several rich binaries. Thedistinction between “operative” and “speculative,” whether expressed in thoseexact words or in others, already echoed one sacred binary: that of the activeand contemplative lives, the vita activa and the vita contemplativa.There was another correspondence, this one of a famous literary nature.Throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance the most widely read and widelyrevered philosophical legacy of late Antiquity was the Consolation of Philosophyof Boethius. This was in fact a Christian work, but one in which its authorintentionally suppressed “theology” (that is, biblical text and doctrine) infavor of “philosophy” (ethical doctrine founded in human reason and frequentlyexpressed in poetic myth, such as that of Orpheus and Eurydice). Philosophy ispersonified as a great lady (Domina Philosophia, or “Lady” Philosophy), whosedignity and authority shines forth from her remarkable physical appearance. Hergarment is marked with two Greek letters: Π and θ. These are abbreviations forthe Greek words for “practical” and “theoretical,” the two branches ofphilosophy—applied and pure, so to speak.Freemasonry as a System of CommunicationOne frequently reads in the pages of intellectual history that around this orthat date certain ideas “were in the air.” It is a remarkable historical factthat some ideas of striking originality and even revolutionary potential havemoved from proposal to widespread acceptance with astonishing speed. But they donot strictly speaking move through the air, except, that is, as the sound wavesof human speech. There were two principal modes of communicating ideas in theEnlightenment period: through the printed word and through the spoken word. Likemost other cultivated people of the age, the Masons did a very great deal ofreading and writing, but they also did a remarkable amount of talking, culturaland political schmooze being a principal feature of their sociability.Since there were so many Masons among the cultivated population, it is onlynatural that Masons by mere demographic necessity played a major role in themultiplex diffusion of opinion and erudition. But of course the Masons did notinvent the learned press, nor in general did the Masons who contributed to it doso because they were Masons. Another major conduit for the written exchange ofideas, private correspondence, was perhaps a slightly different matter.Voluminous private communication is characteristic of many of the leadingintellectual figures of the Enlightenment, some of whom (like Voltaire) haveleft an epistolary corpus staggering in its size. It can be said that EuropeanMasons participated in this cultural habit with a particular zeal, and that theorganization of some of the lodges encouraged it.It has already been noted that among the institutional and material developmentsfavorable to the aims of the Enlightenment we must pay some attention toimprovements in vehicular traffic and road maintenance. These developments werenot surprisingly connected to a major expansion of the postal service. By theyear 1700, a person in many parts of Europe could post a letter to someone inmany other parts—certainly from capital city to capital city—with much higherhopes of its reaching its destination than in a Hardy novel. Hence the use ofthe word “post” in several European languages referring to rapid or regularlyscheduled travel.The mention of a few great names is sufficient to remind us of the epistolarycontribution to our knowledge of the European cultures of the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries. The letters of Madame de Sévigné (1626–1696) havefascinated a readership of three centuries. It is nearly impossible to imaginethe contours of polite society in eighteenth-century Britain without the ten fatvolumes of the letters of Horace Walpole (1717–1797). The epistolary novel nowmay seem to us a form of distracting artificiality, but no aspect of theremarkable realism of Les liaisons dangereuses or of Pamela is truer to itstimes.Pierre-Yves Beaurepaire, a prominent modern French scholar of Freemasonry, hasdone pioneering work on the nature and role played by networks of epistolaryexchange in the rapid transmission of new or controversial ideas. From aprominent correspondent writing from his private house or his communal lodge,letters could go out in all directions like radio waves, circles withinconcentric circles. Then each node might become its own center. The image oftenused even at the time was that of the spider’s web. The “system” could approachthe multiplying leverage of our recent so-called chain letters. A fascinatinghistorical project currently underway involves the detailed study of theepistolary spiderwebs. One special study has examined the correspondencereceived by the Swiss physiologist and naturalist Albrecht von Haller(1708–1777), which even in its extensiveness can be but a part of a much largerwhole. This correspondence comprised 14,207 letters sent from 446 postingstations throughout Europe.The seventeenth-century coffeehouses often had available for their readerscopies of the current press, just as today one will hardly find a European caféthat does not advertise internet access. This amenity was provided by manyMasonic lodges of reasonably fixed abode, which also often went a step furtherby subscribing to the learned periodical press, most of which consisted in oneway or another of letters from the people in the know. The term “newspapercorrespondent” has been ossified in our tongue.One magazine of cardinal importance was the Journal des Savants, which from itsearly beginning (1665) pursued the capacious ambition of offering acomprehensive review of all the serious books published throughout Europe. Theencyclopedic knowledge which was at least a supposed possibility for thepolymath geniuses of the Renaissance might no longer be available even to themost voracious intellectual ambition; but a man who read the Journal des Savantson a regular basis could be the Aristotle or Athanasius Kircher of his age. In acognate development, the radical politics of the Revolutionary age were keptsimmering if not boiling by the numerous Correspondence Societies.The stereotype of the stuffy London gentleman’s club with its rack of newspapersclamped into hardwood rods, and its desks supplied with piles of crested, creamywriting paper, is a vestigial memorial to the early Masonic lodges. “The club”was often the place one wrote his letters, and probably even oftener the placehe read them. I have already mentioned the mystic Jean-Baptiste Willermoz,templarist of Lyon, who wrote letters rather than books.Even more frequently than they wrote letters, the Masons talked—and talked. Whenwe speak of historical figures as the center of a “circle” of influence orintellectual exchange, we are speaking first of all of small groups of peoplemeeting in frequent informal contact. It is precisely the goal of clubsociability to create the environment in which such circles can form andflourish. They did so with a particular luxuriance in the Masonic lodges ofEngland and France.By the middle of the eighteenth century a Masonic lodge was likely to beperforming numerous functions. It was in the first place a center of malesociability, offering at least the opportunity, and very often the stimulus, forserious conversation concerning science, politics, and philosophy. Numerousindividual Masons would call themselves Rosicrucians, and the generalRosicrucian ideal of universal reformation through individual self-developmentresonated with many more. Many lodges were likely to cultivate a cosmopolitan,international outlook, and to host foreigners on a regular basis. Many lodgeswere Correspondence Societies and kept up-to-date libraries. One common featureof particular relevance to the themes of this book is that it was frequentlyamong Masons and in specific Masonic lodges that men pursued the three principaloccult arts: magic, kabbala, and alchemy.BibliographicalThe general reader approaching the history of Freemasonry is very likely to beoverwhelmed. The maxim of Masonic bibliography might well be taken from Dante:Lasciate ogni speranza … Masonic history has been the amateur vocation of manyMasons for at least two centuries, and the bibliography is huge.One very solid historical study of probable Masonic origins is David Stevenson,The Origins of Freemasonry: Scotland’s Century, 1590–1710 (Cambridge, 1988). Ofthe older “standard” synoptic histories, I recommend Robert Freke Gould, TheConcise History of Freemasonry (1903, with later supplements). Jasper Ridley,The Freemasons (London, 1999), is lively and readable.Moving toward the occult side, one should consult the classic trilogy by ManlyP. Hall: The Lost Keys of Freemasonry (1933), Freemasonry of the AncientEgyptians (1937), and Masonic Orders of Fraternity (1950), published together byPenguin Books under the title The Lost Keys (New York, 2006). Alexander Horne’sKing Solomon’s Temple in the Masonic Tradition, 2nd ed. (London, 1988) is fullof curious lore.Among general French Masonic histories, the first volume of Pierre Chevallier’sHistoire de la franc-maçonnerie française (Paris, 1974) is engaging. Seriousscholarly inquiry into the French occult scene must begin with René LeForestier’s formidable La franc-maçonnerie templière et occultiste aux xviiie etxixe siècles, 2 vols. (Milan, 2003), and La franc-maçonnerie occultiste auxxviiie siècle et l’ordre des Élus Coens (Paris, 1987).The French scholars who have written most interestingly on Masonic “sociability”include Pierre-Yves Beaurepaire in Espace des franc-maçons: Une sociabilitéeuropéene au xviiie siècle (Paris, 2003) and République universelle desfranc-maçons: De Newton à Metternich (Paris, 1999), and André Kervella inRéseaux maçonniques et mondains au siècle des Lumières (Paris, 2008).Concerning the intellectual exchange among Masons, Beaurepaire has also writtenRéseaux de correspondance à l’age classique: (xvie–xviiie siècles) and edited Laplume et la toile: Pouvoirs et réseaux de correspondance dans l’Europe desLumières (Artois, 2002).Books specifically cited or alluded to in this chapter:The Yates quotation is from her Rosicrucian Enlightenment (1972); that fromWaite is from his Real History of the Rosicrucians (1887)."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/p166.jpg]The syncretism of Enlightenment esotericism frequently brought together elementsof ancient Christian orthodoxy, Jewish kabbala, and alchemical “science.” This“Cabbalistic Figure,” widely disseminated among German Masons, is meant toexplain the mystery of the Trinity according to inner agreement of the “divinelight” of Theosophy, the “heavenly light” of Theology, and the “natural light”of Philosophy (alchemy).5 Three Occult Arts [../Text/content.xhtml#ch5]IT IS IN THE NATURE of the occult that its pursuit will likely be limited to acognoscenti, a limited group of adepts who think outside the normal boundarieswhich confine the lives and operations of most of humankind, and within whichthey carry out their mental no less than their material lives. Yet the occultarts of the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons inevitably seem much weirder to usthan they did to our ancestors three centuries past. The Enlightenment world wasone of many transitions, but several of the ones that now seem definitely toseparate us from so distant a past were as yet far from complete.In particular, the ambition to encyclopedic knowledge, a desire to “know allthings knowable,” though it seemed increasingly challenging, was not entirelyabandoned. An educated gentleman was meant to know the classical tongues and itsliterature, but also history, natural science, political economy, and moralphilosophy—vast fields all. Neither the specialization of modern learning norits professionalization in application was as marked then as it is today. LordEdward Conway, the patron of Greatrakes the Stroker, diligently acquired currentlearned literature in all fields and from all parts of Europe, and his typecontinued well into the nineteenth century. What we think of as “science,” oftenincluding experimental science, was a common pursuit of educated men; works nowread mainly in college courses devoted to philosophy and political science founda wide general audience. It is against this background that we must examine theoccult arts of magic, kabbala, and alchemy.MagicThe first of the occult arts is magic, and as usual the first problem is theproblem of definition. “Magic,” writes Valerie Flint in her wonderful book TheRise of Magic in Early Modern Europe (1991), “may be said to be the exercise ofa preternatural control over nature by human beings, with the assistance offorces more powerful than they.” But the excellent definition of an historiancan perhaps be yet improved by the excellent definition of a magician,especially one who was the closest thing to a Renaissance Rosicrucian stillextant in the nineteenth century. “Magic is the science of the ancient magi; andthe Christian religion, which silenced the counterfeit oracles and put a stop tothe illusions of false gods, does, this notwithstanding, revere those mystickings who came from the East, led by a star, to adore the Savior of the world inHis cradle.”Here the author is Eliphas Lévi in his History of Magic Including a Clear andPrecise Exposition of its Procedure, its Rites, and its Mysteries (1860).“Eliphas Lévi” was the pseudonym, created by pseudo-Hebraic anagram, ofAlphonse-Louis Constant. Lévi was not merely the greatest of the academicscholars of the history of magic in his age, but also the most renowned of“practical” magicians. His influence on modern occultism was enormous and,indeed, is still lively. He was vastly learned, but the particular significanceof his erudition was perhaps its tenor, which combined profundity and breadthwith a rare spirit of indulgent archaism. If ever there was a master of thegreat library of quaint and curious volumes of forgotten lore, it was he. Bornin 1810, he combined the romantic and reactionary aspects of the Catholicrevival in France with the living inheritance of the late Enlightenment. Hisconcept of magic was inclusive; his book subordinates beneath its rubric bothkabbala and alchemy. But it was founded in the old Rosicrucian sense of magia,and he used the old Rosicrucian dialect fluently.Magia were the arts as practiced by the Magi (the biblical wise men of the oldLatin text). Magia were thus clearly Christian and Catholic, indeterminate andyet radically legendary. The biblical story of the wise men reeks of Orientalromance. The very names of the Magi (Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar) had to besupplied from the world of romance. The Bible said practically nothing about theMagi. They came from the East. They followed a star. Each carried an obviouslysymbolic gift. “They are elevated by tradition to the rank of kings, becausemagical initiation constitutes a true royalty; because also the great art of themagi is characterized by all adepts as the Royal Art, as the HolyKingdom—Sanctum Regnum. The star which conducted the pilgrims is the sameBurning Star which is met with in all initiations. For alchemists it is the signof the quintessence, for magicians it is the Grand Arcanum, for Kabalists thesacred pentagram.”In this taxonomy—magic, alchemy, kabbala—Lévi follows the lead of many of theeighteenth-century occultists. This chapter, too, will follow their lead, thoughit must be realized that many scholars, like many of the old magicians aboutwhom they write, use the word “magic” in that most capacious sense aimed at inFlint’s definition, as any supposed “exercise of a preternatural control overnature by human beings, with the assistance of forces more powerful then they.”In such a scheme alchemy is a subdivision of magic, rather than its parallel,and kabbala more in the order of an ancillary technique.In his magisterial Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971), Keith Thomassurveyed the vast field of “magical” activity in early modern Europe, withspecial attention to the particularly rich scene in Britain. From the hugedomains of the history of magic so broadly conceived, only those few topics mostrelevant to the Enlightenment period will claim our attention here. In general,however ethereal and mysterious might be the tenets of the magicians of OldEurope, their “practice” was at bottom highly material and usually even monetaryin its goals. One can hardly doubt that that has been true in all ages. Thedesire to have knowledge of the future was the dynamic force behind the ancientoracular system. Obviously one wants to know the future with an eye to materialadvantage. Shall I follow this course of action? Is the proposed investmentwise? Should I engage the enemy in battle or sue for peace?To take action based on magical knowledge might be seen at the moral level as akind of supernatural cheating. “What could be more wicked,” asks Virgil when hispupil Dante seems taken aback by the harshness of the punishment of diviners,“than to coerce the divine will?” The poet Lucan praises Cato, who refused theeasy opportunity of consulting the oracle Jupiter Amnon in advance of thedubious battle that awaited him. The Stoic hero said he already knew everythinghe needed to know, namely, the justice of his cause. The most famous line ofLucan’s poem, applied by his admirers to Robert E. Lee, isVictrix causa deis placuit sed Victa Catoni:The victorious cause was pleasing to the gods,But that of the vanquished to Cato!A very common form of magic was astrological prediction. In the ancient andmedieval worlds only the thinnest of boundaries separated what we would think ofas two very distinct enterprises, astronomy (the observation of the heavenlybodies) and astrology (finding predictive portents in the astronomicalobservations). Even as modern scientific astronomy was making the great stridesassociated with the names of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler, there continued tobe a nearly universal belief in the power of astral influence over many aspectsof human activity. The concept of the horoscope is so ancient as to lie beyondthe boundaries of written history.It was based in a belief that the entire plan of a man’s life was fixed by thepositioning of the stars at the moment of his birth. A “horoscope” was theinvestigation of that hour, hora in Latin. A belief in determinative astrologyso flagrantly contradicts the fundamental Christian philosophy of the freedom ofthe will that it may seem surprising that it not merely survived, but thrived,over the long Christian centuries. Spiritualism’s heyday was the nineteenthcentury. It was then that it achieved its own name, its own science (“psychicalresearch”), and its own semi-ecclesiastic institutions. But it had been verymuch a part of Renaissance magic, and it was widely practiced byeighteenth-century magicians like Cagliostro.The issue of spirit-raising in Christendom had had a very long history, but itsdiscussion always returned to a classical biblical source: the story of KingSaul and the Witch of Endor (I Samuel 28). Upon the death of the prophet Samuel,King Saul had banished from the country “all those that had familiar spirits,and the wizards.” The vocabulary in the Latin Vulgate was magi (magicians) andharioli (soothsayers). The relevance of the biblical Latin is that it was itsterminology that dominated the occultist vocabulary. Yet very soon, terrified bythe prospect of a Philistine invasion, and despairing lest he had lost the favorof the Almighty, Saul himself sought a medium who could raise up for him thespirit of the dead prophet. So he sent for a woman with a “familiar spirit”(pythonem in the Vulgate), and she performed the requested sorcery.This text was endlessly vexing to medieval commentators. It definitely provedthat there was such a thing as spirit-raising, and suggested the possibility of“approved” witches, contesting the Church’s claim of monopoly on supernaturalapparatus. Hence a good deal of the commentary tradition is in the form ofexegetical damage control. The spirit raised was not really that of the prophetSamuel, but a diabolical substitution, and so on. For the Enlightenment wizard,on the other hand, the pythonness of Endor offered a valuable role model of themagical art deployed for the benefit of the Lord’s anointed.The language spoken in the spirit world, as in the Westernizing courts ofeastern Europe, was French, as the technical vocabulary of the art will reveal.The word séance means “a sitting,” as in a particular dinner party or the timeof its collation. The Spiritualist use of the term, which has triumphed over allothers, refers to the magician’s practice of gathering a group around a table,usually in more or less deep darkness, holding hands to create a closed “spiritcircle.” In these circumstances, the magician attempts to “raise the spirit” ofsome dead person through vocal communication or even material manifestation.A common feature of the eighteenth-century séance that later somewhat droppedout of fashion was the child medium. Cagliostro’s technique, which was commonalso among other magicians, was to use a young boy of about ten (called apupille) or a girl of about the same age (a colombe, or dove) as the actualintermediary of communication between the spirit world and the earthboundséance. The “raised” spirit sometimes spoke directly through the child’s voice.At other times the magician would interrogate the child, eliciting in reportedspeech the news from beyond the grave. The purity of virginal youth had here asymbolic element. Skeptics found in it also a practical advantage for acharlatan, who might more easily exploit infantile naïveté.THERE WERE VARIOUS FORMS of “mirror magic,” sometimes called “speculation”(connected with speculum, “mirror,” and specula, “watchtower”). These survivetoday in literary form (“Mirror, mirror on the wall …”) and in the crystal ballof popular magical iconography and common metaphor. Its practice involved thesupposed interpretation of ambiguous or distorted images upon a reflectivesurface, especially the naturally reflective surface of water, but also inartificial mirrors, which technological innovations of the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries greatly improved. Ancient mirrors had generally been flatsurfaces of polished metal. Their reflective capacities were comparatively weak,and the images they reflected often dark and imprecise.In fact it was the imperfection and indeterminacy of mirrored images that wasthe principal feature of “speculation,” which also became a theme in theologicaland philosophical writings. In a famous image (I Corinthians 13), St. Paulcontrasts the imperfect knowledge of God available in the present life to themore complete knowledge in the afterlife. “For now we see as in a glass darkly,but then, face to face.” The phrase in the Vulgate was vidimus nunc per speculumin enigmate—suggesting both the obscurity of the image, and the desirability ofpenetrating it.Some magi of the Enlightenment period did use crystal balls, exploiting thepotential of vitreous convexities and concavities to create distorted imagesinviting enigmatic analysis. At his Masonic séances Cagliostro had placed uponthe table a shallow basin of water, in effect a miniature reflecting pool.The idea, apparently, was that the magus could interpret reflections otherwiseincoherent, ambiguous, or actually deceptive. For there was an ancient image,used by Augustine among others, to suggest the fallibility of human sensoryperception. An oarsman sits in a boat with his oars secured in the locks atopthe gunnels and half submerged in the water. It will appear that the oar bendsat the point it meets the surface of the water. The optical illusion is causedby the distorting function of the medium through which the submerged part of theoar is viewed. This image shows up not infrequently in Renaissance Platoniclore. Alciati published an emblem of it, a form of which appears on the titlepage of George Chapman’s philosophical poem Ovid’s Banquet. The idea behind itis the serious inferiority of sensory experience as opposed to the intuitions ofthe “intelligible realm.”Cagliostro on occasion used the polished metallic mirror, for example in hisreported session with Madame du Barry. The du Barry reports that she receivedthe wizard after their mutual friend cardinal de Rohan had assured her that “themagnetic séances of Mesmer are not to be compared with the magic of my friendthe Count of Cagliostro.” Intrigued, she agreed to a meeting. The magician,dressed in one of his magnificent occult getups and sparkling with diamonds,called upon the banished royal mistress in her sumptuous exile. He suggestedthat the mirror, properly approached, could explain both the past and thefuture. Her past, alas, she knew only too well. He warned her that, though hecould facilitate her knowledge of the future, the future itself he could notalter. Caveat speculator. She does not report what she saw in the mirror, but itwas sufficiently alarming to send her into a faint, and to make her firstinterview with the wizard also her last.So widespread did the occult practice of magic become that many aristocratichouseholds, and perhaps also some of the Masonic lodges, kept their ownparaphernalia (crystal balls and the like) among the inventory of their domesticfurniture.One of the commonest forms of magic to appear in the old documents is sorcery.It is almost always regarded as illicit, and frequently as a capital crime. Thetrouble is that it has no definite and fixed meaning and can be nearly asindeterminate as the word “witchcraft” itself. The distant etymological ancestoris the Latin sors—election or decision founded in chance operation such ascasting lots, drawing straws, flipping coins, the random selection of lotterytickets, and so on. Such sorcery was very common in the ancient world, andsurvives today in numerous games of chance. The eighteenth-century sorcerer—andthere were plenty of them—was often the person believed to be able to predict ormanipulate by occult means the outcome of such ostensibly chance operations. Theeighteenth century was the Golden Age of Lotteries. One of the scrapesCagliostro got into in London came about because of his supposed ability to picklottery winners.One form of sorcery became distinctly linguistic, even literary. Bibliomancy wasthe practice of foretelling the future by the random consultation of animportant book: for the Greeks Homer’s Iliad, for the Romans Virgil’s Aeneid.The imprisoned Socrates made a Homeric sors to discover the time of hisexecution. The sors Virgiliana was quite common among educated Romans and, asthe Aeneid remained an indispensable text for the study of Latin through theeighteenth century, it was practiced likewise among the Christians, who,however, were more likely to use the Bible. The potential lawfulness of suchaugury was guaranteed by its frequent appearance in the Hebrew Scriptures, andeven by a specific text: “Cast lots, and settle a quarrel; and so keep litigantsapart.” (Proverbs 18:18) The technique was to approach the book with a questionor problem in mind, open its pages at random, and note with eye or finger thefirst words encountered, which, when properly interpreted, would answer thequestion or resolve the problem. Since the textual “message” was not in everyinstance pellucidly clear, there was often a role for the interpretive sorcerer.Reflections of “biblical lottery” are very common in medieval religiousliterature, as in Augustine’s account of his conversion and the lives of suchimportant saints as Anthony of the Desert and Francis of Assisi. In theeighteenth century, John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, was an avidpractitioner of the sors biblica, though when he was pondering the desirabilityof marriage with a particular woman he preferred the clarity afforded by threehomemade lots of his own: “yes,” “no,” and “not now.” (It was a no.)Sorcerers might also “cast spells,” a spell being a magical formula in writtenor spoken form. This is a Germanic word, the early English version of whichmeant something like “narrative” or “proclamation,” as remembered in gospel, the“good spell.” But soon a spell became a prayer or incantation, usually brief,believed to have a particular therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy. In popularculture there were spells for the different circumstances of daily life. Onethat lived on even after the Protestant Reformation was the “night spell,” anamusing form of which (“From ghosties and ghoulies and long leggety beasties andthings that go bump in the night, Good Lord, deliver us”) was current inPresbyterian Scotland.A passage in Chaucer shows that he considered the night spell a possibly risibleornament of popular superstition and credulity. But ubiquity and breadth ofcultural range were features of the old magic. It was to be found at allcultural levels, from “a cottage of clowns in Botley” to the court of the VirginQueen, whose official magician, Dr. John Dee, was among the most erudite men inChristendom. On its more learned side premodern sorcery preserved the ancientauthority of magical words, signs, and symbols. Here the old Latin word wascharacter. It meant a graphic sign or emblem, such as a brand burned into theflesh of a slave or an animal. Though the word has gone off in its own directionin modern English, we still use it in certain circumstances to mean “letter” orgraphic shape. In the Old World it meant primarily an occult or magic sign, andonce again the casting of characters became a common feature of both popular andlearned magic. Some of the early Fathers of the Church rail against it as acommon superstition, sometimes diabolical.ONE SPECIAL FORM OF MAGIC involved the placement of letters or numbers insurprising puzzle patterns. The “magic square,” both alphabetical andmathematical, is very ancient. The crossword construction of the “Sator Arepo”appears in numerous antique monuments, and seems to have been either invented byor adopted by the early Christian community.images [../Images/p177.jpg]Various technically possible meanings can be imposed on the sentence Sator arepotenet opera rotas, but none is particularly convincing. Arepo, which does notappear elsewhere in the Latin lexicon, must be a personal name, in which caseone possibility is “The plowman Arepo holds the wheels in his labors” (referringto the old wheeled plow). It is not unlikely that a specific occult meaning hassimply been lost. From the graphic point of view, the construct is remarkable asa sentence of five words that forms a palindrome—meaning that it is the sameread backwards or forwards—and is deployed in a geometrical fashion to be readboth vertically and horizontally. The “magic” of the square is in the eleganceof the five interlocking palindromes and in the Pythagorean mysticism of thenumber 5 itself. It is of pre-Christian origin, but it soon became popular amongthe Christians and appears on several early monuments. It proved possible toperform temurah (rearrangement of letters or words) upon it to render variousfar-fetched but grammatically possible sentences of explicitly religiouscharacter. Hrabanus Maurus, an erudite monk of the tenth century and aningenious verbal geometrician, wrote a mind-boggling book in praise of the Crossof Christ, encouraging a vogue for cross words (in a double sense) in whichlater Christian kabbalists enthusiastically participated.The “Sator Arepo” is a magic square in letters. Through ingenious effort menwere able to find an occult meaning in its words, but the genius of itsconception had always been mathematical. The more familiar magic square franklycomposed in numbers is probably older. Here a geometrical square is subdividedinto three or more ranks of smaller squares (n, where n>2). The total number ofsmall squares will naturally be the square of the number of ranks and files intowhich the larger figure has been divided, i.e., n2. The complete sequence of thenumbers beginning with one and ending with n2 is distributed among the smallsquares in such a way that the numbers in every vertical and horizontal column,as well as the two diagonals, add up to the same number. It was this remarkablefeature of the construction that caused them to be regarded as magical.Number theorists have explained the general rules for the construction of magicsquares. They differ for constructs with even or odd base numbers, with theeven-numbered squares being regarded as the more difficult. The biblical textmost frequently cited among the numerologists and kabbalists is Wisdom11:21—omnia mensura et numerus et pondere disposuiti (“Thou hast laid out allthings in proportion and number and weight”). To penetrate the “secret” of themagic square was to reveal a science that brought the magus into contact withthe marvelous harmonies of Creation and, therefore, with the mind of theCreator. The hidden ligatures between letters and numbers so minutely studiedbeneath the mystical microscope of the kabbala fastened together the nodes ofthe capacious textile of the material and mental worlds. Such emblems as the“Sator” or the magic square became the insignia of the occult quest itself.There are numerous visual exemplifications of these assumptions in European art,not counting explicit alchemical iconography, which is an opulent subspecies ofits own. One ingenious anagram creates a Latin cross reading “Paternoster”horizontally and vertically with the center on the letter n. What remains aretwo each of the a and the o, that is, a double alpha and omega to be distributedamong the four quadrants defined by the cross. Number magic was a largespecialized field on its own. As practiced by European magicians, itssyncretistic elements included memories of ancient Pythagorean lore, Jewishkabbala, and Christian allegorical exegesis. There is a famous example in the“background” of Albrecht Dürer’s magnificent etching of “Melancholy” in whichthe numbers from 1 to 16 are distributed among the sixteen partitions in such afashion as to add up vertically, horizontally, and in the diagonals to 34. Thebottom rank—4, 15, 14, 1—has a special significance. Dürer created themasterpiece in the year 1514, when he was forty-one years old. Dan Brown’streatment of Dürer’s magic square in The DaVinci Code, when compared with thetreatment of other aspects of Renaissance occultism in that book, may beregarded as merely a venial sin.Magical spells could thus be “cast” both in spoken and in written form. Certainarticulations were themselves magical. A small library has been written aboutthe origins and significance of the magician’s “abracadabra.” It is presumablymeant to convey an impressive sense of occult learning and esoteric knowledge.That certainly is the origin of hocus-pocus, deriving eventually from the wordsof sacerdotal consecration in the mass: hoc est corpus meum. Written spellsinevitably wed “magic” to the occult arts of kabbala and alchemy, both of which,and especially the latter, made extensive use of graphic characters of occultsignificance and, perhaps, of occult power. Here, as we shall see, the influenceof the opulent iconography of the alchemical books was particularly important.The KabbalaA second field of occult operation was kabbala. The Hebrew root of the wordkabbala means “reception” or “receiving.” The specific reference is to thereceiving of literary and spiritual teaching transmitted by tradition. Butalready in the Middle Ages it had acquired its broader and vaguer meaning ofoccult spiritual doctrine. It has come in common parlance to refer to the entirebody of the esoteric lore of Jewish mysticism. The meaning of kabbala or “thekabbala” is sufficiently imprecise, indeed, to invite a good deal of difficultyand confusion into its scholarly discussion. The kabbala remains part of aliving mystical element in contemporary Judaism, and there are competingmystical schools claiming unique access to the true meaning of this or thatkabbalistic “doctrine.” Fortunately, perhaps, such questions are largelyirrelevant to what the Enlightenment kabbalists were thinking and doing. Thisbrief account of kabbalistic backgrounds must necessarily be skewed toward thiseccentric subject.Study of kabbala has focused on the vast compilation called the Zohar—that is,the Sefer ha-Zohar, the Book of Splendid Radiance, or the Book of Illumination.The Zohar is a huge work of scriptural commentary and speculation, compiled byJews in Spain in the late thirteenth century. Its authorship is not certainlyknown, and it must in fact be an anthology of the work of several spiritualwriters. The name of Rabbi Moses of León, who died around 1305, has sometimesbeen attached to it.There can be few of the great books of world literature that are more difficultthan the Zohar. The vernacular Hebrew (Aramaic) in which it was compiled is fullof cruces (textual difficulties) that have challenged the most learned of modernphilologists. Its principles of organization are less than inexorable.Furthermore, much of it is written in a lyrical mode that often renders itssurface yet more strange and enigmatic. There was a principle in ancient andRenaissance pedagogy of the dificilis per dificilior—explaining difficult thingsin a way more difficult yet. The Zohar is, as one prominent scholar has put it,“a commentary that demands a commentary.” The vast edifice of Jewish mysticismis, in large measure, that second commentary.All mystical “science” in the Judeo-Christian tradition has as its goal theknowledge of God. A central teaching of kabbala involved a formalized scheme ofthe various ways of knowing God, through the divine emanations or manifestationsin the world. These were called in a Hebrew plural the sephiroth (singular,sephira), and they were said to be ten in number. They were frequently deployedin an abstract iconographic configuration called the “tree” of the sephiroth,which vaguely suggested a central trunk with its lateral ramifications. Each ofthe sephiroth was usually indicated by its Hebrew name written within a smallcircle. At the center of the diagram was Tiphereth (Beauty). At the very top wasKether (the Crown). The lateral sephiroth included such concepts asIntelligence, Wisdom (Hochma), Rigor (Gevura), Mercy (Hesed), Splendor (Hod),and Victory (Netzah).The Sephardic Zohar was almost certainly compiled in conservative reaction togrowing rationalist trends among Iberian Jews, many of whom were readers ofMaimonides and others among the “philosophers.” It is a full-throated defense ofdivine mystery and a truth far deeper than the categories of Aristotelian logiccould penetrate. There are close analogies in the Christian world of the sameperiod, in which many mystics clearly were reacting against what they consideredthe aridities of Scholasticism. At the same time the Zohar inevitably shows someevidence of the peculiarly cosmopolitan intellectual milieu of Spain before thecompletion of the Catholic Reconquest, a climate in which there was a certainamount of intellectual and even spiritual commerce among the three Abrahamicfaiths.The adoption and pursuit of the kabbala by important Christian thinkers andwriters was probably inevitable, and it is to the Christian Cabbala (its Latinname) that we now turn, for it was through Christian writers that muchcabbalistic lore came into the mainstream of Renaissance and Enlightenmentoccultism and in particular to some of its Rosicrucian and Masonic adepts. Animportant feature of medieval Iberian intellectual life had been the readyavailability of expert Hebraists. Nicholas of Lyra, the French Franciscanbiblical scholar who in the fourteenth century published an enormouslyinfluential gloss to the entire sacred text, was one of many Christian scholarswho became expert in Hebrew with the help of learned Spanish converts fromJudaism. Many of the Christian scholars of the Renaissance took the study ofHebrew to a seriously advanced level. It was inevitable that they would in timeencounter the rich traditions of the kabbala. To offer a suggestive example ofone of these, it was believed by some of the old Jewish exegetes that Hiram hadtraced within the floor plan of Solomon’s Temple a diagram of the tree of thesephiroth, an idea which, when discovered by Masonic occultists, drew thekabbala into the very foyers of their sociability.ONE OF THE FIRST of the Christian cabbalists was the young polymath genius Picodella Mirandola (1463–1494). It is perhaps not surprising that the Renaissancewas full of Renaissance men; but Pico was still in a class by himself. Italianhistorians used to like to call him “the Prince Charming of the Renaissance.” Atfourteen, Pico abandoned the humdrum study of canon law for the more seriouspursuit of philosophy and languages as he moved about the great intellectualcenters of Italy: Bologna, Ferrara, Padua, and Florence, with a necessarysojourn in Paris, still the greatest University of Europe. He sought a perfectknowledge of the three sacred tongues (Latin, Hebrew, and Greek)—“sacred”because it was in those three languages that the Roman authorities had publishedin placard form the name and pretensions of the crucified Jesus. More unusualfor his age was his mastery of Arabic.At a scholarly congress marking the quincentenary of his death, a scholaroffered a paper cataloguing about a hundred and thirty Hebrew books that Picohad owned. At the age of twenty-three he was making a serious study of thekabbala under the tutelage of Flavio Mithridates, alias Raimondo Moncada, aconverted Jew. At about the same time he compiled his celebrated nine hundredtheses dealing with “everything that can be known”—de omni scibili. No smallamount of what could be known was, of course, occult. Before he died atthirty-one, he would boast: “I believe I am the first [among Christian scholars]to deal explicitly with the Kabbala.”He was by no means the last. Two learned classicists considerably exceeded thepioneering Pico in the depth of their studies in the kabbala. The first wasJohannes Reuchlin (1455–1522), a great reformer of Greek and Latin pedagogy inGermany. His philological approach to biblical studies led him to the Talmud andthe Zohar. The other was the Augustinian friar Giles of Viterbo, who eventuallybecame a cardinal. The Christian cabbalists found no inconsistency between theirtheogical anti-Judaism, which could be intense, and their enthusiasm for Hebrewcommentary. Young David had decapitated Goliath with the Philistine’s own sword.Pico would use Jewish exegesis to refute Judaism. He claimed that thecabbalistic “method” applied to the name “Jesus” actually proved the doctrine ofthe Incarnation theologically denied by the Jews.It may tax the credulity to suggest that kabbala had achieved a certain amountof cultural popularity by the end of of the sixteenth century, but there isevidence to suggest it had done so. In 1587 a scholar named John Pistoriuspublished in Basel as a kind of coffee-table book a huge anthology of the ArsCabalistica, which he also called the “recondite theology and philosophy,”reconditus being a Latin synonym of occultus. This collection included severalessays in Christian Cabbala by the learned Paul Ricius, some Latin translationsof some rabbinic writings thought particularly elegant, the famous book on loveby Leo Hebraeus, and Reuchlin’s own substantial De arte cabbalistica. Reuchlintried to rationalize the Latin vocabulary of kabbala and, in doing so, seemsindirectly to suggest its controversial dimension. Cabalici were divinelyinspired wise men. Their disciples he called cabalei—apprentices of thecabbalistic art. More suspicion hovered over those called the Cabalistae, whowere the imitators of the Cabalici, but perhaps imitators in form only. Ruskinwould one day draw a distinction between true and false griffons. PerhapsReuchlin is here distinguishing between true and false cabbalists.An important feature of the kabbala was its number lore, a good deal of whichhad to do with the exegetical practice of gematria—another form of the wordgeometry. In old Hebrew, and also in old Greek, the letters of the alphabet wereused also as cardinal numbers, a practice half-remembered in our alphabeticalgrading systems for academic performance. The first ten letters of the Hebrewalphabet, from aleph to yod, corresponded to the ten digits of the first decade.The next nine, from kaph to koph, could represent the decades between 20 and100. The final three (resch, schin, and tau) could indicate the numbers 200,300, and 400 respectively.Since every letter has a numerical “equivalent,” every word of the Bible couldbe reduced to arithmetical form by adding up the numbers corresponding to itsletters. Take, for example, the word kether, crown, the sephira at the top ofthe diagram of the tree. Its Hebrew letters are kaph (20), tau (400), and resch(200). The geometrical number of kether, therefore is 620. We may perhaps thinkof this, by analogy with the elaborate protocols devised by Wall Street tradersto securitize a pool of house mortgages, as a system of sacred derivatives.If a = c and b = c, it must be the case that a = b. By this reasoning there wasan equality (often of an occult kind) between words and phrases yielding thesame numerical derivatives. The ingenuity of the kabbalists in this regard oftenstaggers the modern imagination.Though the esoteric teachings of the mystic rabbis concerning the emanations ofGod might well prove controversial in the Christian context, the gematrialmethod, which long antedated the Zohar, had made its way into patristicexegesis. That is, even before the Renaissance and the serious Christianrediscovery of Hebrew and the kabbala, some of the Fathers of the Church hadbeen examining the numbers of the New Testament texts. As mentioned earlier,ancient Greek, too, used the convention of gematria based on itstwenty-two-letter alphabet, in which the first letter (alpha) had the value of 1and the last letter (omega) had the value of 800.Ancient Jewish exegesis had forced attention upon the most minute details of thesacred text. It is no easy thing to make a perfect copy of a lengthy manuscripttext, such as the text of the Torah. The nearly preternatural purity of theaccepted Hebrew text was guaranteed by an elaborate system of mind-numbingscribal “counting” by which it was possible to identify every letter of the textby an ordinal number.One possibly gematrial detail is actually to be found, textually, in the GreekApocalypse, the final book of the Christian Bible. There the “number of theBeast” is 666—a number we must surely meet again before this book is through. Bya kind of “reverse” gematria, eager exegetes have over the centuries been ableto find a large number of satisfying verbal equivalences. One of thecommonplaces of medieval numerology is that the number 8 is “the number of theResurrection,” an idea that makes its frequent if occult appearance in manyplaces in painting, poetry, and architecture. This fact was “discovered” bynumerous exegetical techniques, but the first of them probably was Greekgematria. The Greek name for Jesus bears a gematrial derivative of 888. His“eightness” is confirmed by other convincing resonances, and reflected innumerous musical and architectural constructs, including the typically octagonalbaptismal font.Gematria was the most dynamic way of opening up new interpretive fields in thesacred text, but was not the only way. Two other kabbalistic techniques achievedthe same goal. Temurah was the system that allowed the rearrangement of theletters of a word to find a new possible meaning—that is, exegesis by anagram.In Hebrew, a language in which the combination of three consonants is a geneticverbal principle, this meant that the rearrangement of radical letters was afruitful exercise. It creates a kind of linguistic kaleidoscope. In Latin andthe European vernacular languages, on the other hand, it usually produces a kindof linguistic short circuit, and it was rarely practiced. A few anagrams,particularly palindromes like ROMA /AMOR, show up in the exegetical literature.Notarikon, which takes its name from the kind of shorthand used bystenographers, was a system of syllabic abbreviation or acronym by which wordphrases could be shortened and elided. This has been a characteristicdevelopment in various modern languages, for example in the Russian of theSoviet period, which produced hundreds of words like Comintern (the CommunistInternational). Notarikon is evident especially in Roman monumental inscriptionsand continued well into the Christian period. In the alchemical literature longsentences are sometimes abbreviated, not in every instance intelligibly, to theinitial letter of each word.A singular example of this early Christian–Greek gematria was found in the imageof the dove. From the earliest times the dove had been used as an emblem of theHoly Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, on account of the Gospel story ofthe baptism of Jesus, in which it is said that the Spirit alighted on him in theform of a dove. The dove is, indeed, among the earliest items in the visualvocabulary of Christian iconography. The Greek word for dove is περιστερα(peristera), with a gematrial derivative of 801. One of Jesus’s most famousself-identifications is that in the Book of Revelation: “I am the Alpha and theOmega, the beginning and the end.” Hence he is saying, in numerical form, “I ameight hundred and one.” Thus was proved by Greek gematria—as Pico dellaMirandola would later claim to have proved with the Hebrew letters—the divinityof Jesus Christ. Another Renaissance occultist, Christopher Columbus, adopted acabbalistic “mystical signature” for his official documents.KABBALA WAS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, a dramatic testimony to the dynamic characterof ancient scriptural exegesis. Already by the period of Hellenized Judaismrabbinic exegetes—of whom Philo Judaeus is perhaps the most famous andproductive—had developed a complex web of allegorical interpretation of theTorah, with a special attention to the moral meaning of historicalnarrative—what the Christians would later call the tropological sense. Thus thestory of God’s testing of Abraham on Mount Moriah (Genesis 22), when God orderedhim to sacrifice his firstborn son, while never ceasing to be sacred history,was really about the contemporary conduct of individual moral life. Theallegorical tendency in Jewish exegesis was wholly consistent with manycontemporary fashions in Greco-Roman religions. As Jerome Carcopino and othershave shown us, sophisticated Romans of that age were already interpreting thegreat myths of their tradition in moral-allegorical ways on their funerarymonuments. The overwhelmingly allegorical nature of Christian exegesis of thepatristic period was a development rather than an innovation.Belief in a bottomless profundity of the Torah set in motion a self-sustainingprogram of perpetual commentary. Kabbalistic texts are already themselves essaysin scriptural exegesis, but they invite, indeed may require, exegeticalsatellites of their own. A distinguished American literary critic some years agostated quite openly his belief that literary studies, having reached theirmaturity, could now recognize that works of literature were probably lessimportant than what critics were now able to say about them. It is important torecognize that the kabbalists had a very different view. They thought of theirproject as one of discovery rather than of invention. They were findingthings—occult things—in the secret chambers of the divine Word.It was only natural, therefore, that there should be a comradeship, and oftenmore than that, a collaboration or a conspiracy, between kabbalist andalchemist. Both were seeking to penetrate to the very heart of things.Alchemy“Alchemy” is an Arabic loan word, of which there are dozens in English, such as“alembic” and “algebra,” and hundreds in Spanish, such as algodón (cotton) andalcahuete (a go-between), in which the fossilized Arabic article remains as avivid reminder of an ancient but often forgotten cultural exchange. The Iberianreference is not a mere diversion, since so much of European alchemical lore wasof Sephardic transmission. Though for us there is nearly as much differencebetween an alchemist and a chemist as there is between a hawk and a handsaw,there is actually only an act of linguistic modernization deployed in theservice of the dignity of science. Alchemy was once the chemistry, and thepractitioners of the chemistry were among the principal scientists of theirages. No point is more important for understanding a figure like Cagliostro thanthe prestige of alchemy among the learned men of his age.Like Freemasonry itself, alchemy was for many an ethical quest based in theallegory of artisanal technique, so that it is not improper to make adistinction between “operational” and “philosophical” alchemy. The origins ofoperational alchemy are prehistoric; but European alchemy, as it flourished inthe Middle Ages and was reborn with even greater enthusiasm in the Renaissance,bears the clear influence of Egyptian, Greek, and Arabic sources. It was foundedin certain metaphysical principles of Aristotle, made mystical by the Egyptians,and made scientific by the Arabs. As it flourished in Christendom, it notsurprisingly also became Christian. What perhaps is surprising is the way it didso. Christian ideas were not superimposed upon ancient alchemy in somesuperficial way. Instead, for most of its practitioners, alchemy would becomethe scientific branch of Christian mysticism.The practical aim of alchemy was the transmutation of metals. The alchemists hadno conception of molecules or molecular structures. They did, however, have apractical knowledge of some chemical compounds and metallic alloys. They alsobelieved in an “original matter” (prima materia) of which all other matter was acorruption or debasement. The prima materia was associated with the chaos ornothingness out of which God had created the world. “The earth was waste andvoid; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.” (Genesis 1:2) This text wasparsed minutely. It did not say that God had created ex nihilo, out of nothing.It did not say that there was no earth, but that the earth was waste and void.There could be no darkness upon the face of the earth were there no face of theearth. Here was the theological spoor of the prima materia.The art of the alchemist was very different from modern experimental science.“The chemistry,” wrote Friar Bacon in his thirteenth-century treatise onalchemy, “is the science that teaches the method of creating a certain medicineor elixir which, when brought together with impure metals, infuses them withperfection at the very moment of contact.” The alchemists were not trying todiscover the nature of the physical universe. They were trying to rediscover,largely through the study of arcane books and the performance of establishedrituals, an elite high art transmitted to them in a dark and secretive fashionover long centuries from the ancient philosophers. Their work in thelaboratories (workshops) will seem to us less experimentation than performance:the performance of magical or sacramental rites demanding a setting blessed bytradition.We have literally hundreds of pictorial representations of the alchemist’slaboratory, some of which, from the Rosicrucian period, are highly detailed. Wealso have some well-preserved Renaissance laboratories now housed in museums.Though they vary greatly in elaboration, the basic furniture is constant. Therewas a furnace or forge upon which a crucible (a vessel so named because of itstraditional cruciform shape) could be fired. There was also a free-standingwarming oven called an athanor, often built in the shape of a tower. Several ofthe implements came into Latin and the European vernaculars, like the word“alchemy” itself, with the old Arabic article still prefixed. The furnacerequired various metal bowls and dishes, alembics (used in distillation),aludels (pear-shaped ceramic or glass vessels used in sublimation), tongs, ahammer, and perhaps above all a bellows to increase the heat produced by thefire. Some of the tools were identical to those used by potters, glassblowers,and masons; most of them were already ancient in the Middle Ages.The furnace had two chambers, separated by a carefully constructed tight-fittingdoor called by the wonderful name of the “seal of Hermes”—the distant originalof our “hermetically sealed” and “vacuum-packed” processed foods. The complex ofretorts and alembics used in the distillation process was called the pelican, asthe positioning of a long glass “beak” suggested the distinctive shape of thatbird. In the moralized nature of the bestiaries, the “pious” pelican was said tofeed its young with its own very life blood spouting from its pierced breast.The commonplace interpretation of the “pious pelican” as image of theself-sacrifice of Christ was incoherently, but piously, attached to thealchemist’s quest.An accoutrement of cardinal importance was the egg. Allegorical eggs are a dimea dozen in alchemical literature, and the Egg was one of the most strikingfeatures of alchemical iconography. This egg was an ovoid receptacle in ceramic,glass, or even crystal, intended to contain the final stage of the Great Work,or Magnum Opus. This term referred with a rich ambiguity both to the finalmetallic transformation of the matter and to the fullness of the ethicalself-mastery and self-realization of the alchemist. All of the alchemicalapparatus soon took on symbolic meanings. The egg would appear to have been bornof symbolism and finally returned to it. Such is the suggestion of A. J.Sheppard, who wrote learnedly on “Egg Symbolism in Alchemy,” in which he brieflytraces the nearly universal cultural symbolism of the egg as ground ofgestation. The “world egg” being the central symbol of ancient Creation myth,the alchemists almost naturally adopted it as the emblem of their attempts toreturn to the prima materia. “For this purpose the apparatus was of no lesssignificance than the materials themselves: the creation analogy was carried astage further by the employment of a vessel of truly symbolic form—a vasmirabile.”Alchemy was founded in a scientific observation concerning the states of matterthat is as honored today as it was in ancient Egypt: the observation that thesame material can exist in solid, liquid, or gaseous state. It was anobservation founded in quotidian empiricism, in seeing the effects of coldweather on a pond or observing the steam rising from a boiling pot. Skilledworkers in ceramics and metals exploited it with considerable sophistication.The whole business of alchemy was to explore its implications, which is to saythat alchemy was an art of the stovetop and of the furnace. Alchemists wereforever at the forge boiling and melting away, always in the hope of effectingan igneous purification or substantial transmutation.Like everything else in the material world, metal had its hierarchy. Silver wasless precious than gold but more precious than copper; all were more preciousthan iron. The hierarchy is with us still today, with certain modifications. Theconsummation most devoutly wished by the alchemists was the transformation of“base” metal into gold. That was what they often meant by the Great Art, and itis probably what the popular mind today thinks of when it hears the word“alchemy.”It is precisely in the concept of the Great Art, however, that we shall find anenabling ambiguity of Enlightenment occultism. Probably from very ancient times,from the “alchemy” of the ancient cults of Egypt, the initiation into thescience of metals had also an allegorical-moral valence. The project ofpurification, amelioration, and transformation externally manifested at theforge betokened an inner transformation of the alchemist’s spirit. The analogywith the relationship between operative and speculative Masonry will be obvious.C. A. Burland, one of the elegant popularizers of alchemical history, describesthe development of Renaissance alchemy precisely in terms of a spiritual return.“The alchemist of medieval times was gone from his cell. His books remained tolead others, but they were used in a way he hardly imagined,” he writes. “Thetrue philosophical alchemists thought of them as allegories and, although theyperformed the actions as a ritual, few of them saw more in the work than anillustration of a theory.”Our old literature is rich with works which play off the contrasts between theliteral and the symbolic, or the “carnal” and the “spiritual,” to use the termstheir authors themselves were comfortable in using. One recurrent image is thatof the journey, and especially that self-consciously religious journey that waspilgrimage. Dante’s Divine Comedy begins with a narrator both literally andfiguratively “in the middle of the journey of our life.” (The actual, empiricalauthor, Dante Alighieri, born in the year 1265, and allotted as all men areallotted by the Bible a lifespan of seventy years, is in the year 1300, the yearin which the poem is set, exactly thirty-five years old.) He is also lost in adark wood, a real one—real at least for a moment before emerging, like aphotographic negative developed in its chemical bath, into a spirituallandscape.Dante’s subject is supernatural, the state of souls after death. Chaucer in theCanterbury Tales never entirely leaves the realm of an earthly verisimilitude.His characters are on the road, an actual one, the road leading from SouthLondon to the Martyr’s shrine at Canterbury. But the great moral force of thework arises precisely from the exploitation of a contrast always implicit andoften enough explicit between theory and practice, between a spiritual ideal anda mundane reality. All the great literary epics of the Renaissance have theirallegorical levels. Some, like Spenser’s Faerie Queene, seem to have no other.Alchemy, too, was a journey, and one fully freighted with ambiguous potential.Chaucer has a whole story about alchemy, but he also has some zingers in coupletform that underscore the ease with which cupidity might be confused withphilosophy. We cannot say for certain that Chaucer’s medical pilgrim (theDoctour of Phisik) is an actual alchemist. Many alchemists were doctors, and forprobably obvious reasons doctors and alchemists frequently collaborated. Chaucerconcludes his description of the doctor—a man learned in the medical literatureof a millennium, but one whose “reading was but little on the Bible”—with thefollowing couplet:For gold in phisik is a cordial.Therefore he lovede gold in special.A cordial meant a “heart medicine” or remedy. Medieval doctors did use tincturesmade from ground gold, and they sought to refine a “potable gold.” Paracelsus,perhaps the most famous of alchemist-doctors, in the sixteenth century found ingold an effective treatment for epilepsy. Medicinal gold has not entirelydisappeared even from the modern pharmacopia. But of course one knows thatChaucer’s doctor loves gold “in special” for reasons other than medicinal. TheRosicrucians had a word of contempt for alchemists whose terminal interest wasthe material gold. They called them souffleurs: puffers, bellows men. Onepopular image of the carnal alchemist was that of a man with visage burnt orreddened from blowing upon the fire beneath the crucible. “I blowe the fir tilthat myn herte feynte,” says the alchemist’s apprentice in Chaucer.In describing one of his few “ideal” pilgrims, the Clerk of Oxford, that samepoet approaches the Great Art directly. The clerk is a studious, intellectual,unworldly fellow, with threadbare cloak and scrawny mount.But al be that he was a philosophre,Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre.Here there is play on the word “philosopher,” which meant both roughly what itmeans today, a seeker after truth, and an alchemist. The latter meaning wasprobably the more common at the time. Most intellectuals know that the classicgoad—If you’re so smart, why aren’t you rich?—is unanswerable. The indictment of“philosophers” on the charge of cupidity was very broad. They had a reputationfor lechery as well as for avarice. It is Faust’s weakness that turns a searchfor all knowledge into the desire to have Helen of Troy in his bed.Today, “philosophical” alchemy survives in a single linguistic fossil that wasat the very center of the old alchemists’ quest: the philosophers’ stone, lapisphilosophorum in the Latin. The philosophers’ stone was the summum bonum of thealchemists, the means by which the Great Work was to be accomplished. Perhaps noconcept in the vast lore of alchemy more perfectly exemplifies the marvelousambiguity of the enterprise. For some alchemists it would be an actualsubstance, perhaps even an actual stone. For others it was a spiritualsubstance, related by triangulation to the sulphuric sun, the mercurial moon,and Azoth. For yet others the true lapis philosophorum was the cosmic Christ,the stone that the builders had rejected, now become the chief cornerstone(Ephesians 2:20). An ancient strain of alchemical theory had held that the GreatWork would be a symphony of science and soul. The man who set out to purify theelements of the fallen earth must himself first be purified.A significant image of medieval alchemy had been that of the “chemicalmarriage,” taken, as we have seen, for the title of one of the importantRosicrucian manifestos. Such nuptial imagery was very ancient, but it can besaid to have been endemic both in ancient Greek idealism and in the medievalChristian mind, fed by the Pauline idea of the wedding between Christ and hisChurch. The allegory of this marriage became standard in the exegesis of thelush language of the epithalamium of the Song of Songs, which had indeed inrabbinic exegesis already received spiritual interpretation. The idea that theSong of Songs was “actually” a love duet sung by Christ and the Church was souniversally accepted that it appears in the running heads of the AuthorizedVersion of 1611. In the later Middle Ages the poem had been given a Marianinterpretation, with the sponsa (the female “beloved”) now identified as theBlessed Virgin.These sacral allegories manifestly influenced alchemical iconography, but therewas an ancient secular tradition that was also important—namely, the marriage ofMercury and Philology. That is the unlikely title (De nuptiis Mercurii etphilologiae) of a best-selling work by the fifth-century pagan grammarianMartianus Capella. Martianus’s book popularized the idea of the Seven LiberalArts—an idea that dominated European pedagogy well beyond the Renaissance andcan be said to be alive yet. The precise valence of the allegory is difficult toisolate, but it may roughly be said to concern the union of wisdom andeloquence, or abstract knowledge and its written expression. Augustine had madea somewhat similar allegory of the gold and silver liberated from Pharaoh’shousehold by the escaping Hebrews. The gold was the wisdom of the pagans; thesilver the eloquence in which it had been expressed.The alchemical marriage was that between the (male) sun and (female) moon,chemically sulphur and mercury, and the generation from the chaotic primamateria (original matter) of the philosophers’ stone. A remarkable etchingpublished in a cabbalistic-alchemical handbook in Frankfurt in 1628 includes animage of “Coitus” in which the sun-king propositions the moon-queen in thelanguage of the Song of Songs: “Come, my beloved, let us embrace to generate ason who will be unlike his parents.” Her reply is: “Behold, I come to you, and Iam most ready to conceive such a son, unlike any in the world.”The study of alchemy has been called “the study of an error” that has smallclaims upon the historian of science. Yet practical and positive results canflow from radical theoretical error. The consequences of Columbus’s discoveriesin the American hemisphere are not blunted by his own theory that placed him inAsia. A very great deal of the practical techniques of experimental chemistry,and a good deal of material science, we owe to the old puffers and distillers,condensers and sublimators lost in their wild goose chase of the mind.Some of the old alchemists seemed to know this even while in mid-chase. In hiswonderful poem “Love’s Alchemy,” Donne despairs of ever plumbing the mystery oflove to its depths, but nonetheless finds his accidental consolations:O! ’tis imposture all;And as no chemic yet th’elixir got,But glorifies his pregnant pot,If by the way to him befallSome odoriferous thing, or medicinal.So, lovers dream a rich and long delight,But get a winter-seeming summer’s night.A very remarkable work by a very remarkable man is the Alchymista christianus(The Christian Alchemist) of Pierre-Jean Fabre, published in Toulouse in 1632.Fabre was born into a provincial French Catholic family about 1588 inCastelnaudary in the old compté of Lauragay (now the Aude). Though he developedcosmopolitan interests, he remained a lifelong provincial. His center of gravitywas never Paris but the small, old cities of the South. He trained in medicineat Montpellier, still among the foremost medical schools of Europe, andmaintained intimate intellectual connections with the university circles inToulouse.Fabre is important less because he was in many ways exceptional, though he was,than because of the ways in which he was representative of a major strain ofamateur erudition in pre-Enlightenment Europe. Fabre tried—and without manyvisible signs of inner struggle apparently tried with success—to keep abreast ofscience within the context of a liberal Catholic consciousness. On the otherhand there is some evidence of external tensions. His overt defense ofParacelsus and the “Empirics” caused him some problems with the theologyfaculty.In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance the genre of the spiritual allegory, inwhich the Christian life could be compared with every imaginable analogue (and afew scarcely imaginable), was tediously rampant. One had not merely soldiers offaith, but also farmers, tinsmiths, vine-dressers, fishermen, hostlers, cutlers,saddlers, and bricklayers of faith. Fabre’s Christian Alchemist is decidedly notof this genre. He is a real alchemist, who has appointed himself the task ofdemonstrating that the pursuit of the Great Art and the pursuit of Christianperfection are not merely analogous but identical. He argues, accordingly, thatthe interpretation of the mystical emblems inherited from the ancient alchemicalemblems is strictly analogous to the decipherment of Holy Writ.images [../Images/p197.jpg]The title page of the Alchymista Christianus (1632). The Christian Alchemist wasan early attempt by Pierre-Jean Fabre, a learned Provençal physician, toreconcile alchemical science and Catholic theology. The year 1632 was the sameyear that Galileo was ordered to Rome for ecclesiastic trial.While it is not easy to adduce a representative example from a work so large andcomplex, his treatment of the cross will perhaps serve. “Wise men [sophi], andall the ancient magicians and cabalists [magi, cabalistae] concealed themysteries of Nature beneath enigmas, tropes, and figures” of such economy that asingle icon might convey as much as could be written in a large book. In supporthe alludes to the Egyptian hieroglyphs in which, just about that time, the earlygeneration of Egyptomaniacs typified by Athanasius Kircher had discovered theirown universal key to all mythologies.images [../Images/p198.jpg]In one sign alone, the ancient astrological sign for Mercury—a cross, atop whichhas been placed the sun, a circle, and above that the moon, a crescent—Fabrefound a summary of the entire created world in its connection with the Creator.The central sun is the origin of that “hot” (in the humors theory) that is thesource of all earthly vitality. The geometrical peculiarity of the line of thecircle is that it has neither beginning nor end. It is permanentcontinuity—“just as the natural heat enclosed within the special motion of theworld has neither beginning nor end.” The moon, for its part, supplies the“moist.” “That radical ‘moist’ is the mother of all things, just as the inner‘hot’ is the father.”This, so far as Fabre was concerned, was ancient wisdom as solid as Holy Writitself. Or perhaps one should say as liquid. Mercury, the anomalous liquidmetal, which had been discovered early, had a particular fascination for theearly chemists. Later, the medical doctors discovered that its poisonousqualities might be harnessed in the chemotherapeutic treatment of syphilis. Inthe earliest chemical theology, Mercury was of course identical with Hermes, the“thrice-great” (Trismegistus) god of the wisdom of the Egyptians. Hermes madethe somewhat awkward descent from being a god to being an author. It was he towhom our oldest occult writings are ascribed, and from whom they take theirname: the Hermetic Corpus (Corpus Hermeticum). Among his works was the mostancient and influential of alchemical treatises: the Tabula Smaragdina, orEmerald Notebook. The Hermetic Corpus was said to have been transmitted throughthe prophetess Mary, or Miriam, sister to Moses. The wisdom of Hermes began, asall such books must, with a cosmogony, an account of the Creation of the world.With little effort the Christian occultists were able to see in it a manifestoof pure monotheism. “As all things came into being by the contemplation of One,so all things arose from this One, by a single act of creative adaptation. TheFather therof is the Sun. The Mother is the Moon. It was carried in the womb bythe wind. The earth is the nurse.” Here we have in a slightly variant form anearly expression of the four essences: earth, air, fire, and water. Shakespearerepeatedly calls the moon “watery,” an idea doubtless as old as the most ancientobservations of the operation of the tides.Medieval plagiarism differed from modern plagiarism in a dramatic way. Themodern plagiarist hopes to pass off someone else’s work as his own. For themedieval plagiarist, the operation was reversed. He hoped to pass his own workoff as someone else’s. For if Bede or Caesarius of Arles had written it—aboveall, if Augustine had written it—it was bound to be read. The actual origins ofthrice-great Hermes are shrouded in the mists of Hellenistic Egyptian antiquity.This uncertainty provided an opportunity to his doppelganger, pseudo-Hermes, topublish such theological tractates as the Book of the Twenty-Four Philosophers,in which two dozen thinkers come together for a seminar on a single question:“What is God?”So for Fabre, hermetic and patristic traditions could unite in a single stoutcord of “wisdom.” That still leaves the base of the sun and the moon—the cross.The whole of the physical and chemical operations of the world—for Fabre stillthe center of the only known universe—is supported by the cross, to which hethen devotes several chapters that are “mystical” and “scientific” in equalmeasure. There is so much cross-lore in medieval literature that it would berash to attribute to Fabre an absolute originality here. Many writers found inthe cross the fixed staple from which the material world took its stability. Onegreat writer, Bonaventure, in his widely read Lignum vitae (Tree of Life), foundin the shape of the cross the essential geometry of the universe.That probably was the source of the speculations attributed to Paracelsus in abook of similar title: the Liber Azoth, sive de ligno et linea vitae. Paracelsuswas perhaps the most famous of all alchemist-physicians, of whom there were verylarge numbers well into the eighteenth century. Fabre cites this book. “Azoth”was the alchemical name given to a supposed universal medicine, the object ofone of the alchemists’ perennially fruitless searches. Its “cross connection”was probably unavoidable given the verse of the Apocalypse (22:2) in which it iswritten of the Tree of Life that “the leaves of the tree were for the healing ofthe nations.” The alchemical design encapsulating this book-length mystery isthe majuscule T set within a circle and touching its circumference at the threeextremes. This is “the great sign of God, which roughly corresponds with thesign of Mercury.”images [../Images/p201.jpg]We see once again the nearly direct transmission of medieval exegetical ideasinto the occult arts of the Rosicrucians and Masons. For the circled T is indeedan ancient mysterious sign. It is in the first place geographical and indeedcartographical, being the form of that most ancient of universal maps called the“T and O.” Its allegories were numerous. The T could stand for terra and the Ofor oceanus, so that it was a map of the great world surrounded by the greatsea. The watery parts were the perimeter of the enclosing circle and the Titself, the Mediterranean—a name that means, of course, “the middle of theEarth.” The three landmasses were the three anciently known continents: Asia,Europe, and Africa, each of which had been founded by one of the three sons ofNoah: Shem, Japheth, and Ham.But the capital Roman T was also, and especially, a therapeutic form of thecross, the final letter tau of the Hebrew alphabet, later transposed to theGreek tau, which was in the form of the Roman T. This letter had a generalmeaning of “sign,” as the legal “mark” of an illiterate was an X, and as westill say, “X marks the spot.” Already in the Hebrew Scriptures the tau had a“kabbalistic” flavor. It was the saving sign, to be made in the blood of thelamb, at the initial Passover. Later (Ezekiel 9) it was the redeeming mark to beplaced on the foreheads of those to be spared in the universal slaughter thatwas to fall upon Jerusalem. The tau cross frequently appears in later Christianexegesis and mysticism. It was for its therapeutic powers that it became theinsignia of nurses in the medieval world. For the same reason Francis of Assisiappropriated it as his “mystical signature.” The Cross was the salvation of theworld, and its leaves were “for the healing of the nations.”The indirect testimony of contemporary literature sometimes offers a perspectivenot to be found in the more obvious primary sources. Two classic works from theearlier periods of English literature give us insight into the ambiguities ofalchemy as viewed by those who lived among its practitioners: Geoffrey Chaucer’s“Canon’s Yeoman’s Tale” in the Canterbury Tales (about 1380) and Ben Jonson’sbitter play The Alchemist (first performed in 1610).At an advanced point in their journey to Canterbury, Chaucer’s pilgrims areovertaken from a distance by two men riding hard on their lathered horses. Thetwo are a canon (member of a religious order) and his domestic servant, theyeoman. The canon is an alchemist; the yeoman has been his apprentice or, as henow comes to see it from an altered moral perspective, his accomplice. The taleis an oblique narrative exposure by the yeoman of the fraudulent operations ofhis master, the canon-alchemist. By the end of his tale the yeoman has decidedto abandon his old master and join up with the pilgrimage in progress.Chaucer is a moralist, and one of the themes he implicitly develops is acontrast between a material and a spiritual alchemy. Through his informalconfession, the yeoman has joined in the penitential spirit of which the pilgrimis ostensibly an emblem. In abandoning the attempt to make gold, he hastransmuted the base metal of his character into a kind of emblematic gold.Furthermore, the yeoman, long practiced at the forge, deploys a rich technicalvocabulary of the equipment, the operations, and the special jargon of thealchemist in a fashion that commands occult authority. The reader (or hearer)will have the sense that this is the real thing. But the subtler interest of thestory for the history of alchemy probably lies elsewhere, in the psychology ofthe alchemist.He is a cheat and a fraud. Through a mechanical trick he appears to createwithin his crucible a small fragment of gold with which he can dazzle hisvictims—dupes or investors, depending on how one views things. Yet Chaucermanages to convey the psychology of a true believer. The canon’s motive is morecomplex than simple greed. One has the sense that he cheats not because hedisbelieves in the Great Art, but because he does believe. One aspect of genuineobsession, perhaps, is to subordinate the empirical evidence to the a prioritheory. This time it failed. Next time it will succeed … next time.The subtlety of Jonson’s Alchemist is of another sort. The alchemist is indeednamed “Subtle”—which means merely cunning and duplicitous—but there is littlethat is morally nuanced in the play. Another of its major characters is SirEpicure Mammon. Its subtlety lies rather in the presentation of its characters,all of whom are “bad,” though interestingly distributed among categories offolly as well as of active vice. The great vice is cupidity: the love of moneyis the root of all evil. Jonson does seem aware that all confidence schemes mustdepend to some degree upon the cupidity of their victims.In the verse “Argument,” or synopsis, preceding the dramatic action, Jonsonsummarized the crimes of the alchemical conspirators, who have in the temporaryabsence of its owner commandeered a London house to use as the stage set oftheir fraudulent activities:Much company they draw, and much abuseIn casting figures, telling fortunes, news,Selling of flies, flat bawdry, with the stone …What is interesting here is that alchemy, properly speaking, is but one part oftheir operation, which includes, in effect, the whole range of the occult artsof the Renaissance. They “cast figures” as magicians and astrologers. They tellfortunes as clairvoyants. They sell “flies”—that is, demonic spirits—assorcerers. And all this is mixed with “flat bawdry,” in the narrow sense thewhorehouse they have established with Doll Common, but in the larger sense theconnection everywhere seen in the moral literature between the illicit searchfor gold and the cruder pleasures of sensuality. Subtle boasts that he will makeone of his female dupesfeel gold, taste gold, sleep gold:Nay, we will concumbere gold!One of the “scientific” problems of alchemy was that its opulent poetic lexiconand visual library ossified a number of ancient ideas whose shelf life wasfinally expiring. We think of modern science as “advancing” or “building,” asone investigator uses the achievement of a predecessor as a foundation orstarting place. Premodern scientists were much more likely to try to accommodatetheir activities to long-established first principles and axioms. Astronomy,even while rapidly “advancing” in our terms, sought to accommodate its findingsto the Ptolemaic system long after it became difficult to “save theappearances.” So far as the practice of alchemy was concerned, there were manypractical advances in technique, but they were at the theoretical level simplyfolded into the ancient paradigms. Among the old tropes few were more venerablethan the analogy of macrocosm and microcosm.“I am a little world,” wrote Donne, “made cunningly of elements …” A morecommonplace poet, du Bartas, will put the idea in more commonplace form:For in man’s self is Fire, Aire, Earth, and SeaMan’s in a word the World’s Epitome,Or little map …An advanced thinker like Francis Bacon was discarding this notion, which, as hewrote disapprovingly in his Advancement of Learning, implied that “there were tobe found in man’s body certain correspondences and parallels, which should haverespect to all varieties of things, as stars, planets, universals, which areextant in the great world.” Yet alchemy was wedded to this notion, even as itstrove to transcend it.Alchemical “anthropology,” as transmitted through its iconography, maintainedthe teaching of man as microcosm, in that both the great world and the smallwere composed of the four essential elements (essences) of earth, air, fire, andwater. Early theories of human nature were singularly lacking in what we wouldthink of as psychology or “personality.” The word personalitas, had it existed,would have meant the abstract condition of being a personage, and thus roughlyequivalent to role, function, or office. The view was mechanistic and indeedchemical. Just as there were four external essences, there were in the humanbody four fluids (humores in Latin): blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm,which in their relation to the admixtures of four qualities (moist, dry, hot,and cold) determined what we would think of as “personality type.” Thecorrespondences did not stop there. Each humor related to one of the fourseasons of the year and one of four major bodily organs. For example, blood wasassociated with the essence air, the season spring, and with the liver. Itsqualities were hot and moist. A person in whom this humor reigned was called“sanguine” (from Latin sanguis, “blood”).Though we have entirely abandoned the theory of the humors, we still use theadjective “sanguine” to denote an attitude of confidence or self-assurance, justas we use the adjectives “choleric,” “melancholic,” and “phlegmatic” to denotecharacteristics or attitudes once associated with them.The alchemists were in some ways like modern cancer researchers. They weresearching for the absolute or fundamental ground of biological life—which forthem would necessarily be intimately involved in a complex knowledge ofspiritual correspondences. They sought nothing less than the quintessence ofthings—a word manifestly meaning the fifth essence, the one that would unlockthe mystery of the other four. It is only an intellectual perspective not yetinvented in their own age than can deny them the title of scientist. Theirscience would be avidly pursued throughout the learned circles of Europe, and inparticular throughout the complex and far-reaching web of European Masonry.Alchemical IconographyOne particular feature of the alchemy of the Enlightenment period was itspictorial opulence. Alchemical iconography was one of the important conduits ofRosicrucian and Masonic occultism. Western medieval religious art had adistinctly emblematic or symbolical character, and this dimension is prominentalso in what is usually taken to be the more “realistic” painting of theRenaissance and Baroque periods. The conventions of Christian iconography asthey developed over a millennium became relatively uniform, though so complexthat the field of iconographic studies played a significant role in thedevelopment of the modern discipline of art history. There were numerousliterary sources of Christian iconography, but the great source was naturallythe Bible. As late as the end of the eighteenth century, as we have seen, theartist-mystic William Blake could still say that the Bible was “the Great Codeof Art.”Some secular books also developed more or less elaborate traditions of pictorialillustration. These included certain legal and historical texts. Works ofunusually wide diffusion, such as the Consolation of Philosophy of Boethius,were lavishly illustrated. A few vernacular poems, such as thethirteenth-century Roman de la Rose, have a rich iconographic tradition. But themost opulent body of secular iconography was to be found in scientific texts,among which the alchemical books were preeminent. The illustrations in thealchemical manuscripts often seem very strange. They try to imagine in pictorialterms such notions as the sun-man and the moon-woman. They often include amongtheir decorative elements the signs of the Zodiac, the astral bodies, and thechemical elements derived in many instances from classical ancestors. Theyfrequently introduce mythological figures.Christian iconography had a signal pedagogic function. It was a very old beliefthat there were two modes of teaching: par parole et par peinture, as Richard deFourneval put it in the fourteenth century, by word and by picture. Gregory theGreat is supposed to have said of the images in the churches that they were thebiblia pauperum, the Bibles of the illiterate. Alchemy was no art for theunlettered, and from its ancient and medieval origins alchemical iconographyheightened rather than attenuated the mysterious doctrines it illustrated. Bythe height of the Enlightenment, scholars had available an extraordinary body ofhermetic images designed to foster and explicate the mysteries of the art. Thisvisual evidence is the subject of an important book by Stanislas Klossowski deRola: The Golden Game (1988).The efflorescence of alchemical esotericism coincided with the efflorescence ofprinting. In the incunabulum period, however, very few items from the largemanuscript bibliography of alchemy crossed into print. By the end of thesixteenth century the situation had changed dramatically. There was in the firstplace a new outpouring of more “contemporary” alchemical texts, and many of themwere sumptuously illustrated. “By that time,” writes Klossowski de Rola,“printing had improved, allowing the reproduction of even the finest linedrawings, and copperplate engravings replaced for the most part the coarserwoodcuts used previously.” Once again, we see technological novelty put to theservice of ancient tradition.The images were called by their inventors “hermetic emblems” and “hierographicalfigures,” among other things. Such names honored two related erudite Renaissancetraditions: the enthusiasm for fancifully interpreted Egyptian hieroglyphs onthe one hand, and the emblem books on the other. Early Renaissance knowledge ofthe hieroglyphs derived mainly from the Hiergolyphica of Horapollo (HorusApollo), an alleged Greek translation of an ancient Egyptian work. The historyof this text is one that actually satisfies many of the fantasies of scholarshipas imaged by Hollywood. It was found on a Greek island early in the fifteenthcentury by a Florentine monk, who bought it for Cosimo de’ Medici. It is acollection of allegories based upon ancient Egyptian images, some real and someimaginary.Only some of these hieroglyphs were actual elements of the old Egyptian writingsystem. Most were simply cryptic images, which is roughly the translation of theword “hieroglyph.” There was nothing cryptic about the hieroglyphs for literateancient Egyptians; they would have found Indo-European alphabets “cryptic.”Ficino, one of the grandfathers of the Christian Cabbala, praised thehieroglyphs of Horapollo for their capacity to convey in finite imagery nearlyinfinite flights of thought. He says this, for example, concerning the“dragon”—a monstrous creature circled with its tail in its own mouth. “Our wayof thinking about ‘time’ is complex and shifting. For example: ‘time goesquickly’; ‘time revolves and ends up where it began’; ‘time teaches prudence’;‘time gives and takes away.’ This whole range of thought was comprehended in asingle firm figure by the Egyptians when they drew a winged serpent with itstail in its mouth.”The “emblem books,” most famously exemplified by the sensationally successfulEmblemata (1522) of the Italian jurist Andrea Alciato, were a literary genrepopular throughout Europe. They were in effect a collection of newly mintedhieroglyphs in which a small etching, accompanied by a brief moralizing text inLatin, gave a word to the wise.Many of the cryptic illustrations in the new alchemical literature of theseventeenth century actually did derive from Horapollo, and also from Alciatoand his rivals and imitators. One particular feature of the alchemical emblemswas their hermetic use of classical mythology. There was already a longtradition in Christian exegesis of spiritualizing mythography—that is, offinding Christian religious meaning in the old pagan texts. The mythographicenterprise, indeed, is one of the signal achievements of medieval humanism.Boethius’s Consolation of Philosophy, one of the cultural constants linking lateAntiquity with the secular asceticism of the Renaissance in an unbroken chain,included famous meters moralizing such classical poetic motifs as the Golden Ageand the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Hercules, already a moral model inantique Stoicism, became in Christian Europe the object of learned philosophicalcommentary and the model of epic heroism. The baroque Metamorphoses of Ovid,which was the Latin world’s great mythological encyclopedia, was called withoutirreverence “the Bible of the poets.” So classical mythology offered thealchemists a ready-made high seriousness relatively free of the dangersattendant upon speculation about the sacred text.One of the finest of the picture books is Michael Maier’s Atalanta fugiens(1618). Maier, like many alchemists, was a doctor of medicine, who in timebecame the personal physician to Emperor Rudolf II. It seems to have been Rudolfwho converted Maier to occultism rather than the other way around. Maiertraveled widely in Europe, and spent some time at the court of James I inEngland. He was the very model of aristocratic cosmopolitan erudition. The longsubtitle of Atalanta fugiens begins thus: “New chemical emblems concerning thesecrets of Nature, arranged to appeal equally to the eyes and to the intellect…”Atalanta was a kind of Arcadian Artemis. Her father, who would brook nodaughters, exposed her as a babe on a mountainside, but she survived, nourishedby a bear. Passing over several famous episodes, she later returned to herfather’s house on condition that she be allowed to remain a virgin, never tomarry. When nonetheless harassed by suitors, she and her father agreed to thefollowing plan. Being almost supernaturally fleet of foot, she would compete ina foot race with any suitor brave enough to try. Assuming no man would ever beather, she agreed, disingenuously, to marry the man who did. Losers, who proved tobe numerous, were to be killed.However, a suitor named Hippomenes, as sage as he was ardent, appeared. Heprayed to Venus, who, outraged by any vow of virginity, granted Hippomenes aid.She supplied him with three golden apples. During the race, which Hippomenes wasabout to lose, he tossed the apples just ahead of Atalanta. Her pauses to pickthem up gave Hippomenes the time needed to squeak through to victory. Atalantareconsidered her position as she contemplated the handsome winner, and shewillingly, indeed enthusiastically, agreed to marriage. But Hippomenes made afatal mistake. Instead of going immediately to the Temple of Venus to thank herfor her succor, he took his bride to the Temple of Jupiter to thank him forvictory. Venus, outraged, so inspired the couple with her erotic influence thatthey then and there, right in the middle of Zeus’ fane, performed the coitalact. Even Zeus had some standards, and this he regarded as flagrantlèse-majesté. He punished the lovers by transforming them into a pride of lions.If the myth of Atalanta had not already existed, the alchemists might well haveinvented it. Here was the allegorical center of the art (gold) playing acomplicated and complicating role in their central allegorical institution(marriage). The old Christian moralizers could find a negative “message” in thegolden apples. That love of money (cupiditas in the Vulgate) had defeated thenoble aspirations of votive virginity just as an unbridled sexual desire hadincurred its just divine retribution.The title page illustration to Atalanta fugiens presents the history of Atalantain continuous narration—that is, placing distinct and temporally successivenarrative episodes within a single frame. We see the foot race, the amorousforeplay in the temple, the postcoital lover-lions, and a good deal more. Thetitle page declares the book to be “a new chemical emblem book dealing with thesecrets of Nature … accommodated in part to the eye and in part to theintellect.…” The book is among other things a great popularizer and synthesizerthat made the erudite and the arcane widely known among a popular audience.There is an analogy of sorts to be drawn with the use of the Tarot cards, thepopularity of which dates from the Renaissance. Early European playing cardsvaried considerably in design and number before settling, after a longevolution, into today’s generally accepted fifty-two-card, four-suit deck. Therewere several different decks used in different games; the Tarot deck, which alsohad several different names, is taken from a once popular French game, tarot.Two of its features were the large number of cards in a set (more than seventy)and the rich and eclectic iconography of the card faces. Only in the eighteenthcentury, at a time when card playing (and especially card gambling) approachedthe status of social mania in genteel circles, did the occult dimension of theTarot appear. By then the Tarot deck was old-fashioned if not antique, and itspictorial repertoire increasingly exotic. The iconography of the Tarot cards wasdrawn from various sources, both popular and learned. Among the former were theold tradesmen’s signs, which also featured prominently in the old inn and publichouse signs in England. The more learned strain did include a few time-testedalchemical emblems. Most important, like the images in the emblem books and thealchemistry manuals to which they are distantly related, the Tarot cards were ofa visual variety and complexity that practically invited a dilated narrativecommentary. Such a commentary, called “reading” the cards, magicians of variousgenres were increasingly expert in supplying.Literary and iconographic evidence alike attest to the very widespread culturaldiffusion of alchemical ideas and images throughout the Enlightenment period. Itis true that among many thinkers, alchemy had a musty and medieval whiff aboutit. Yet insofar as there was a “popular” idea of a scientist, it found itsexpression in the image of a learned man laboring amid his exotic implementswith their exotic names. In the year 1700 almost anybody interested in “theadvancement of science” was likely to have an interest in alchemy; and even asexperimental science developed during the eighteenth century, the alchemicaldream remained vivid for many scientists.Other occult arts demonstrated their vitality. Magic, “the preternatural controlover nature by human beings, with the assistance of forces more powerful thanthey,” was perhaps less respectable, yet still widely pursued in a world inwhich as yet so much of what we today think of as “settled” science was still inmysterious flux. For the literary-minded, indeed for large swaths of theclassically educated European intelligensia who sought wisdom from ancienttexts, kabbala and its associated exegetical sciences, sacred and secular alike,continued to exercise a fascination. The Rosicrucian manifestos had revealedancient Eastern wisdom from the tomb of Christian Rosenkreuz. The Freemasonssought the ancient wisdom of Hiram through the portals called Jachim and Boaz.It was only natural that in such circles the old learning would mingle with thenew, and even in surprising ways direct its energies.BibliographicalA good general introduction to the major topics of this chapter is AntoineFaivre, Access to Western Esotericism (trans. of Accès de l’ésotérismeoccidental) (Paris, 1986).There are two magisterial scholarly studies of the old magic: Keith Thomas’sReligion and the Decline of Magic (London, 1971) and Valerie Flint’s The Rise ofMagic in Early Medieval Europe (Princeton, 1991). A work far more in the spiritof the Enlightenment magicians themselves is Eliphas Lévi (A-L Constant), TheHistory of Magic, Including a Clear and Precise Exposition of its Procedure, itsRites and its Mysteries, trans., with a preface and notes, by Arthur EdwardWaite (London, 1913; many times republished).From the large literature on alchemy, I suggest the following excellent books:C. A. Burland, The Arts of the Alchemists (New York, 1968); Johannes Fabricius,Alchemy: The Medieval Achemists and Their Royal Art (Copenhagen, 1976); and P.G. Maxwell Stuart, The Chemical Choir (London, 2008). The beautiful book ofStanislas Klossowski de Rola, The Golden Game: Alchemical Engravings of theSeventeenth Century (London & New York, 1988), deals with the fascinatingiconography of alchemy.Most of the rich bibliography of kabbala naturally deals with ancient andcontinuing Jewish spiritual practice. Christian Cabbala, which was at firstprincipally an exegetic aid, took on a life of its own in the Renaissance. Themost important work is in French: François Secret, Kabbalistes chrétiens de laRenaissance (Paris, 1964), but there is in English Philip Beitchman’s Alchemy ofthe Word: Cabala of the Renaissance (Albany, 1998). There are two erudite booksby Allison Coudert: Leibniz and the Kabbalah (Dordrecht, 1995) and The Impact ofthe Kabbalah in the Seventeenth Century: The Life and Thought of Francis Mercuryvan Helmont (1614–1698) (Leiden, 1999).Books specifically cited or alluded to in this chapter:The citation from Burland is from his Arts of the Alchemist (1968).The Book of Wisdom, relegated to the Apocrypha by Protestants, was veryinfluential in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The text here cited is from theLatin Vulgate."},{"pageContent":"images [../Images/p214.jpg]Alessandro Cagliostro was a highly controversial character throughout the courseof his public career. Among his most ardent followers he could be regardednearly as a saint. Several of the most widely circulated print portraits, suchas this one, borrowed from clichés of sacred iconography to suggest an etherealand spiritual dimension to the man’s character.6 Cagliostro Ascending [../Text/content.xhtml#ch6]I. Giuseppe Balsamo and Count CagliostroIf it is a science at all, history is the most provisional of the sciences, ananthology of temporary judgments. For despite the importance of physicalclimates, of immutable economic laws and class structures, of technologicalinnovations and famines and epidemics, history is very largely concerned withthe mysterious genus known as Homo sapiens. In this terrain it is the novelistand not the historian who may be the true master. “Never,” writes Henry James,“say you know the last word about any human heart.” To aspire for thepenultimate word is sufficiently audacious. The philosophes of the Ancien Régimeundertook the mighty project of dismantling the fascinating and enchantingcastle of ignorance of the European “mentality,” accumulated over centuries inits great Gothic subdivisions and baroque elaborations, but like mostrevolutionaries they were at best only partially successful. Furthermore, whentheir work came in its turn to be reviewed by their ostensible successors, theVictorian sages, the judgments were often no less bemused and severe than thatof Voltaire on the Convulsionists of Saint-Médard.In 1833 Thomas Carlyle, then a rather young sage, published two long essays,much celebrated in their era, that painted a distinctly negative picture of theeighteenth century. The first, reprinted in his collected works under the title“Diderot,” was ostensibly a book review. The French Enlightenment had no single“poster child,” but Denis Diderot (1713–1784), the genius of the greatEncyclopédie, would have had as good a claim as any man to incarnate itscharacteristic spirit. In 1821, a scholar named Naigeon had brought out a largeedition (22 volumes) of Diderot’s works. Ten years later, four more volumesappeared. These were printed from manuscripts left by the dying Diderot to hisfriend Baron Grimm, another major figure of the French Enlightenment.The occasion—perhaps the better word would be pretext—of Carlyle’s “Diderot” wasthe appearance of these supplementary volumes. Carlyle’s attitude is signaled byhis opening sentences. Diderot had not yet been dead for half a century when hewrote them. “The Acts of the Christian Apostles, on which, as we may say, theworld has, now for eighteen centuries, had its foundation, are written in sosmall a compass, that they can be read in one little hour. The Acts of theFrench Philosophes, the importance of which is already fast exhausting itself,lie recorded in whole acres of typography, and would furnish reading for alifetime.”So little, it would seem, was Thomas Carlyle awestruck by the Age of Reason. Buthis attitude toward Diderot is not unsympathetic or even unrespectful. He findshim, however, a man severely limited. “What duties were easy for him he did.…”His fuller condemnation of the eighteenth century and its principal works isreserved for his essay on Cagliostro, who will be the principal subject of thischapter. Carlyle declares it his intention “to examine the biography of the mostperfect scoundrel that in these latter ages has marked the world’s history … thechief of all such, we have found in the Count Alessandro di Cagliostro, Pupil ofthe Sage Althotas, Foster-child of the Scherif of Mecca, probable Son of thelast King of Trebisond; named also Acharat, and Unfortunate Child of Nature; byprofession healer of diseases, abolisher of wrinkles, friend of the poor andimpotent, grand-master of the Egyptian Mason-lodge of High Science,Spirit-summoner, Gold-cook, Grand Cophta, Prophet, Priest, and thaumaturgicmoralist and swindler; really a Liar of the first Magnitude, thorough-paced inall provinces of lying, what one may call the King of Liars.”This is what English professors usually call “vigorous prose,” and we might wishto find the occasional essay by Carlyle in the New York Review of Books. But itmay tell us more about Thomas Carlyle than it tells us about Cagliostro. A largeocean often separates primary and second sources, between what a person writesand what others write about what a person writes. A reader wishing to test thefairness and justice of Carlyle’s portrait of Diderot is not limited to aconsultation of half a dozen “definitive” studies and biographies of the lasthalf century. That reader can actually go back to Naigeon’s twenty-two volumes,and to the numerous improved editions of various works by more recent scholars.Quite a few have done so, and not many of them have ratified Carlyle’s view. ButCagliostro did not leave “acres” of typography. There are few autograph sourcesto which we can turn. Under these circumstances, the default source has been thesecondary source. Most of the “scholarship” on Cagliostro has consisted ofinterrogations of or contestations of Carlyle. Since Carlyle himself has joinedDiderot in cultural oblivion, modern interpreters of Cagliostro have often beenbattling with two unseen ghosts.The chiefly significant primary sources that have been used for the life ofCagliostro are the following: (1) a few documents probably written by Cagliostrohimself; (2) various dossiers compiled by Louis XVI’s police, and especially thelengthy deposition made at the time of the Necklace Affair; (3) some scabrousarticles in the journal Courier de l’Europe for 1786; (4) an attack by aprofessional rival, Jacques Casanova; (5) miscellaneous references incontemporary memoirs of the period, especially important for Cagliostro’s“Strassburg period”; (6) an itinerary of the Cagliostros’ European travelcoerced by the authorities from Serafina (his wife), manifestly inaccurate atleast in part; and (7) reports of reports made by the Inquisition in Rome andfashioned into propaganda “biography” that might justify throwing the man into aprison from which he would never emerge alive.Some of the sources of the evidence are themselves clearly suspect. The Parispolice would do anything the royal party instructed them to do, and the royalparty wanted Cagliostro’s scalp. Practically any number of the Courier del’Europe, run largely by blackmailers, will make Rupert Murdoch seem like LouisaMay Alcott by comparison. Most historians today regard the Inquisition as a fargreater iniquity than any it pretended to expose; and its evidence drawn fromconfessions produced by torture or the threat of torture are notoriouslydubious. Yet the anonymous Inquisitorial biography has perforce been regarded asa document of cardinal importance, especially as it was widely distributed in aFrench translation, Vie de Joseph Balsamo (1791). It paints a picture of a manof the vilest moral character, a pimp, a cheat, a thief, a fraud, a forger, animposter whose villainies are sordid rather than interesting or engaging. It isnearly impossible to believe that such a man could have commanded the friendshipand patronage of so many of the leading men and women of the cities in which hetook up residence. Hence, one may wish to entertain doubts concerning thereliability of sources on which we must nevertheless perforce depend.Thus it is not surprising that room has been found in the documentaryinterstices for a view of Cagliostro very different from that of Carlyle’s Kingof Liars: a kind of Rousseauian Cagliostro, the friend of humanity, a man of aprecociously liberal political spirit, a true seeker after truth and anEnlightenment martyr to a doomed but still potent spirit of reaction. I cannotpretend in this chapter to resolve what is irresolvable, but I do hope to tellCagliostro’s story from a possibly novel perspective. For whether the man was ofthe Enlightenment he was certainly in the Enlightenment—that is, made possibleby certain circumstances characteristic of the Age of Lights.Historians beginning with the hack biographer commissioned by the RomanInquisition are generally settled in the belief that theremarkable man whocalled himself the count of Cagliostro was actually born to a “good” family ofreduced means named Balsamo in Palermo, in Sicily, in 1743. At his baptism hewas given the name of Giuseppe (Joseph). Young Giuseppe was a rebelliouschild—meaning that he kicked against the pricks of the dour religiosity of hisguardians, who designed for him a clerical life and sent him off to thepre-seminary of San Rocco. From there, still coerced by family expectations, hewent at the age of thirteen to the ancient Sicilian town of Caltagirone, wherehe became a novice in the hospital of the Benfratelli.Before proceeding, however, it is necessary to raise a problem not common inmodern biography. Biographers may differ in their interpretations of theirsubjects, but they are usually agreed that they are at least writing about thesame person. We have some good documentation for the life of Giuseppe Balsamo.We have some excellent documentation (beginning in the year 1776) for the lifeof Count Cagliostro. Most standard reference works state as a simple anduncontested fact that Giuseppe Balsamo and Count Cagliostro are one and the sameperson. A rich literature is founded upon that assumption. Cagliostro’s two bestbiographers, however (Trowbridge in 1911 and Lalande in 1912), point out thatthere is no definitive evidence to prove it. Count Cagliostro’s enemies wouldhave had every reason to slander him, and few slanders would have been moreeffective in that world than “unmasking” one of the darlings of Europeanesotericism as a Sicilian nobody. Neither writer denies the identification, butthey see in its too easy acceptance the operation of a persistent historicalprejudice that has virtually guaranteed a faulty judgment of Cagliostro. Withthis rather odd caveat in mind, we can return to young Giuseppe Balsamo.The picture we get of Italian religious life of that age is far from inspiring.About the time that Balsamo was with the brethren, Edward Gibbon, now very mucha lapsed Catholic, sat in the Franciscan church of the Ara Coeli in Rome,planning in his mind his great history, the sacred mumble of the friarsperforming the office seeming to him the perfect emblem of that sad decline inRoman magnificence that was Christendom. Much of the greatness of the Old Worldwas made by great monks, the Benedicts and the Bernards. Conversely, much of thegreatness of the New World was made by men who shrank from the limitations ofreligious life—Luther, Erasmus, Rabelais. Young Balsamo was more Rabelaisianthan Bernardine.The order to which he was attached, relatively new, was one of several“hospitallers,” for whom the word “hospital” still had its older meaning, moreaccurately rendered by the modern hospice. The Benfratelli specialized in worksof corporal mercy, palliating the suffering of the sick and burying the dead.Though Giuseppe Balsamo soon enough revolted against religious life, one aspectof his education with the hospitallers may have been particularly significant.The brothers had a small apothecary’s “laboratory” in which they preparedremedies, potions, and palliatives. The Inquisition biographer claimed that init Balsamo appears to have learned some rudiments of what we would today callchemistry. The old literature—the Faust legend, Romeo and Juliet, Friar Baconand Friar Bungay, among many others—preserves for us the literary ancestor ofthe mad scientist, and he was usually a friar.We can see at the very least certain stylistic affinities between the oldpolymath friar and the Enlightenment scientist, even if we shrink before therashness of claiming a lineal descent. In his heyday, the twin aspects of CountCagliostro’s fame were medicine and alchemy. He traveled with his own portablebeakers and retorts, and sometimes set up an elaborate laboratory in his rentedrooms. It is at least possible that he thought of himself as being as much afriar as a magician.But the juvenile delinquent, chaffing beneath the yoke of an uncongenialasceticism, several times ran away from the monastery. Such flight was alwaysunsuccessful, for in truth he had nowhere to go. His family would not take himin, and he was as yet too young to undertake the bold international travel thatdefined his later career. Each time after a brief and unsatisfactory period ofliberty, he was forced to return to the Benfratelli, who inflicted upon him thesevere corporal punishment that was in that age the expected recompense ofyouthful rebellion. Not surprisingly he tired of these repeated frustrations,and at last devised an audacious plan of securing a definitive release to thegreat world after which he lusted. If being bad was insufficient, he would beterrible.The story, of course, comes from the Inquisition biographer, but it is almosttoo good not to be true. An important feature of religious life in the oldBenedictine tradition was the so-called lectio divina, or “sacred reading.” Thelectio divina was actually a technique for turning Bible-reading into prayer andspiritual meditation, not only in the recitation of the psalms from the DivineOffice, but in other circumstances as well. Among the metaphors for thespiritual absorption of the holy text were those of manducation. We speak stillof “ruminating” over a book or “digesting” its contents. It was only naturalthat alimentary and spiritual consumption would be joined together. In manyreligious houses the communal meals were taken “in silence”—meaning that therewas supposed to be no conversation among the diners—while a designated member ofthe community read aloud from the Holy Scriptures or some edifying religiousbook.Among the favorite source material since medieval times was hagiography—thelives of the saints. One classic work of the thirteenth century is called theLegenda Aurea—The Golden Legend—where the word “legend” still has its Latinsense of “a thing to be read” rather than a tale of dubious veracity. By thelater Middle Ages the lives of some newly canonized saints, such as St. Francisof Assisi, were being written with an eye to the needs of refectory lectors.Once when his appointed stint as lector came around, young Giuseppe Balsamo sawhis opportunity and seized it. In reading aloud in the refectory from somehagiographic book or another, he substituted for the names of the sacredpersonages mentioned in the text the names of the most notorious harlots ofPalermo.This induced a near riot of indignation in the monastic dining hall. ThoughCaltagirone was nearly two hundred kilometers distant from Palermo, many of thebrothers—we need not ask how or why—were very familiar with these names. Herewas unprecedented scandal. Here was blasphemy. Here was behavior literallyincorrigible; and as correction was impossible, only one remedy remained:expulsion. The fox and the wolf threw the protesting rabbit back into the briarpatch.“Of the difficulties that perpetually beset the biographer of Cagliostro,” wroteW. R. H. Trowbridge, one of the best of them, “those caused by his frequentdisappearances from sight are the most perplexing.” Trowbridge actually had inmind the documentary lacunae of the later 1770s and the decade of the 1780s.These years are indeed punctuated by puzzling gaps, but the greater mysteryhovers over the period before real documentation begins, between Balsamo’sdeparture from Sicily and Cagliostro’s appearance in London in 1776.We do not know for certain when Balsamo was born, but there is an officialecclesiastical document claiming to be based in an original baptismal registryattesting to the administration of the sacrament of initiation on June 8, 1743,in the metropolitan church of Palermo. A quarter of a century separates thisdocument from the next one we have: a marriage certificate. On April 20, 1768,Joseph Balsamo married a Roman woman, Laurenza Feliciani, in the church of SantaMaria de Monticelli in Rome, presumably the bride’s parish. We know much less ofBalsamo’s wife Laurenza than we do of Balsamo himself. That means we know verylittle indeed. And after their wedding, Giuseppe and Laurenza Balsamo disappearfrom the pages of history.In alluding to the mysterious decade that separates Balsamo from Cagliostro Ihave intentionally suppressed one testimony that, if we could believe it, wouldgive a picture of the newly married Italian couple. It is in the Memoirs ofJacques Casanova. In the spring of 1769, Casanova spent several weeks inAix-en-Provence recuperating from illness. One day the talk at his inn’s tabled’hôte was all about two Italians, a young married couple, who had just arrivedin Aix as pilgrims, on foot, from the celebrated pilgrimage shrine of St. Jamesof Compostella in Galicia—a hike of about a thousand miles. They had made quitea stir by entering into the town with a lavish distribution of alms among theroadside beggars.Unlike Casanova they spoke little French, and Casanova appointed himself tocheck them out. He found two weary travelers resting: a beautiful girl holding alarge crucifix, and a rather grumpy young man, a few years older, adjusting thecockleshells of the pilgrim’s garb. He sized them up with a glance. The womanradiated nobility, modesty, innocence, sweetness, and decency. The man’s “vibes”were rather different: boldness, insolence, derision, and knavery. “Hispassport, issued in Rome, called him Balsamo,” writes Casanova; “she, havingnever changed her name, was called Serafina Feliciani. The reader will find thissame Balsamo become within ten years Cagliostro.” The Inquisitorial biographer,too, tells a tale of a pilgrimage to Compostella. According to him, it was ahypocritical ruse devised to exploit opportunities for fraud and extortion.Casanova wrote a good deal about Cagliostro, but only the foolhardy will takehis judgments as objective truth. Rarely will the Pot’s testimony concerning theiniquities of the Kettle escape its own interrogation. Casanova was wont toapprove of beautiful women and to disapprove of their inconvenient husbands. Thetruth is that Casanova and Cagliostro, if not exactly peas from the same pod,are siblings of the Enlightenment, international travelers and adventurers whosecareers were made possible by the same broad social changes and especially bythe structures and conventions of the international Republic of Letters. Bothmen march across the second half of the European eighteenth century trailingscandal, to be sure, but also admiration. Casanova began as a magician and neverentirely abandoned his esoteric pursuits. Casanova’s most famous exploit was hishighly publicized escape from an odious prison in the Venetian Republic.Cagliostro became famous first as a victim of Bourbon tyranny in the Bastille,and then as an actual martyr of the Roman Inquisition. These were credentials ofthe highest order among the enlightened enemies of the old order.It is only later that the Count Alessandro Cagliostro and his wife the CountessSerafina appear. Concerning Serafina we know more that we did of Laurenza. Allsources agree that she was a woman of great beauty. Several mention herconsiderable charm. One legal document attests to the fact, supplied by Serafinaherself, that she was unable to read or write in any language—a fact ratheramazing in light of the learned pretensions of her husband and of the cultivatedcircles in which she often traveled. In some of the more salaciousanti-Cagliostro propaganda she is presented as a woman of loose morals. Inparticular she is accused of sleeping around in the furtherance of her husband’sschemes. The source here is the Inquisition biographer, who presents her as areluctant whore pimped out by her vile husband. There is, however, no otherevidence to support these slurs. On the other hand there is abundant evidence ofthe love and harmonious affection shared by the married couple. There is noexplanation for the fact that they remained childless, but it would be rash tofind portentous significance in a not uncommon medical condition.Were Giuseppe Balsamo and Count Cagliostro one and the same person? The answermust be an annoying yes and no, with the most important action in their sharedhistory taking place off camera. The key to understanding the problem probablylies in the Masonic concept of elevation, or philosophical conversion. The Saulof the streets of Palermo became the Paul of the drawing rooms and lodges ofLondon and Paris. This is the idea implicit in Trowbridge and Lalande, and ablyaugmented by Paolo Cortesi, a popular scholar of esotericism, in an excellentbiography entitled Cagliostro: Maestro Illuminato o volgare impostore?(Cagliostro: Illuminist Teacher or Simple Fraudster?). “Balsamo used folkmedicine and magic to sell his amazing pills to imbeciles; Cagliostro wascommitted to the Rosicrucian mission of succor to the ill. We shall never knowwho or what caused this extraordinary transformation.”II. Cagliostro Arrives in LondonIn July 1776, about the same time that events of significance to our nationalhistory were transpiring in Philadelphia, Count Alessandro Cagliostro and hiswife the Countess Serafina were arriving in London. Indirect evidence suggeststhat they had sailed to England from Lisbon or Oporto. It is sometimes said thatthe friendly understanding between England and Portugal is the oldest continuingalliance in Europe, and there was a lively wine trade in the eighteenth century,with many ships going to and fro. What is particularly interesting aboutCagliostro’s stay in London in 1776–77 is that for a man who has earned thepermanent reputation of a polished swindler, he himself was repeatedly swindledby comparative amateurs.Cagliostro took furnished rooms in a house on Whitcombe Street, on the west sideof what is now Leicester Square. In the 1770s, the neighborhood was one thatwould have to be described as transitional—and the transition was of a decliningnature. Leicester Fields—the park that has now become the familiar pedestriansquare—had originally been the enclosed garden of magnificent Leicester House,but by the middle of the eighteenth century it was surrounded by privateresidences, apartments, and boardinghouses, respectable but by no means grand.Many of them housed struggling genteel international transients. Cagliostro’slandlady, whose curiosity and gossip would prove unhelpful for her new tenants,was wont to boast of having titled foreigners under her roof.If in somewhat ambiguous social circumstances, the count and countess were atthe very least passing for “quality.” Even shoestrings cost something, and theproblem of Cagliostro’s money is troubling for a biographer. He arrived inLondon with a good deal of it—in specie, letters of credit, and jewels—whichwere commonly used as quasi-liquid tokens of exchange. When he left London indisgust in November 1777, he claimed to have been taken by the city’s rapaciousresidents for 3,000 guineas—an enormous sum. We have no evidence from thepost-Balsamo period of credible accusations against him relating to swindles orlarge-scale financial fraud. Yet he usually had sufficient means to project forlengthy periods of time a “lifestyle” of genteel respectability, and oftenenough a certain lavishness. He was obviously generous to a fault, as more thanone dismal experience attests. Despite his wide reputation as a healer, areputation that often inundated him with supplicating patients, he made it apoint of honor not to accept money payment for his treatments. Where did hismoney come from?Later he did, of course, frequently enjoy the hospitality and patronage of verywealthy people. The cardinal de Rohan was one of the richest men in France. InMitau he had enjoyed the largesse of the von Medems, whose letters ofrecommendation proved invaluable to him in Poland and Russia. He arrived inStrassburg in notable splendor, with an elaborately decorated coach and liveriedservants. The assumption among the “occult” historians has been that he wasbeing bankrolled, for political purposes, by wealthy members of one of theGerman secret societies, probably the Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt, which hadalso been founded in 1776.But his sources of support in London are by no means clear. What seems certainis that in his financial dealings as in other parts of his mysterious career,Cagliostro was enabled by important developments in international bankingcharacteristic of his period and, indeed, intellectually and thematicallyrelated to the “internationalism” of the Enlightenment.One of the count’s first moves, news of which was instantly published in theneighborhood, was to establish within his rented quarters an alchemicallaboratory, and display within it his impressive beakers and retorts. At thispoint Cagliostro spoke practically no English and the countess none at all. Theysoon became friends with one of their fellow lodgers, a multilingual Portuguesewoman of the familiar eighteenth-century category “distressed gentlewoman,” whobecame the countess’s companion and translator. Cagliostro’s boardinghouse seemsto have offered shelter to as many protagonists of the humbler sort of life’stragedies as any in Balzac or Henry James.Madame Blavery (the Portuguese lady) boasted widely among the dubious diasporaof her acquaintance of her friendship with the Cagliostros, advertised theircharacteristic generosity, and apparently considerably exaggerated the means bywhich they exercised it. She had an Italian friend, Vitellini (an ex-Jesuit ofmysterious exness), who spread the rumors among his own yet more dubiousfriends. “Thus by the indiscretion of Vitellini,” writes Trowbridge, “Cagliostrowas soon besieged by a crowd of shady people whose intentions were so apparentthat he was obliged in the end to refuse to receive them when they called.” Itwas in this context that Cagliostro encountered the threat, by no means thefirst nor the last, of blackmail.Blackmail was altogether more common in Cagliostro’s world than in ours.Blackmail today, which appears in detective fiction more frequently than inactual life, is a form of extortion in which Party A threatens Party B to revealto the police or an unsuspecting spouse information concerning Party B sopotentially injurious to him that he will be willing to pay to have itsuppressed. This concept of blackmail assumes some actual information of acompromising nature. The eighteenth-century sense was somewhat more elastic. Ingeneral the blackmailer threatened publication of certain claims, presumed to bescandalous, in a book or journal of potentially wide circulation. The scandalousmaterial might be true, partially true, or not true at all. It might be put in afictional form that so very thinly disguised the objects of attack as to leavetheir identities obvious to anyone in the know.The word “libel” originally meant just “a writing” or “a little book” as thelibretto of an opera still does. It took on its negative and legal meanings onlywith the expansion of printing in the seventeenth century. In facteighteenth-century “literary” blackmail, of which Robert Darnton has written soengagingly, was one of the undersides of the expanding “print culture” which wasalso one of the great enablers of the Enlightenment. It depended for its successon a robust gutter press and an ever-expanding reading public insatiable in itsappetite for scandal. Both conditions existed in Paris and London. This form ofblackmail might be regarded as a quasi-literary form of the protection racketsthat later became a staple industry among organized criminals. As we shall see,furthermore, London was the place of publication of one of the moreirresponsible French-language international “tabloids,” the Courier de l’Europe,edited by the notorious Théveneau de Morande.An Italian named Pergolezzi threatened to publish a libel denouncing Cagliostroas a fraud and an imposter. Specifically, he threatened to expose the count’signorance of the science he pretended to practice, and to advertise the actualtenuousness of the financial resources that had made him in the eyes of many agreat man. Since according to a French document conveniently discovered yearslater, Cagliostro in his Balsamo days had been an apprentice in Pergolezzi’sworkshop in Italy, the threat is very remarkable for what it does not threaten:namely, to expose Count Cagliostro as Giuseppe Balsamo. As Trowbridge pointedout, none of the many enemies of the man ever came forward to claim that theyknew him both as Balsamo and as Cagliostro. Furthermore, as Cagliostro did notrespond to the threat, and as Pergolezzi did nothing further, we must concludeit was a kind of trial balloon. There would be worse to come.It is not possible in short compass to give an account of all the scrapes thecount and countess got into in London; but the supposedly ruthless Italianadventurers were much more in the category of “harmless as doves” than “wise asserpents.” His early difficulties with his fellow lodgers in Whitcombe Streetbegan with a “Captain Scott,” who soon enough by self-elevation became “LordScott,” and who for a time sponged off the Cagliostros with great success. Hebegan by pretending to have lost some of Cagliostro’s Portuguese money, which hehad offered to negotiate for sterling, before moving on to bolder extortions.When finally chased away by the exasperated Cagliostro, his “wife”—“LadyScott”—pretending to have been deserted by his lordship and left in the lurch,continued to mulct with success. Eventually she discarded her pretense andreclaimed what might have been a real name (Miss Fry), under which she sued himfor money he did not owe her, throwing in a charge of witchcraft for goodmeasure.Cagliostro’s more serious difficulties with these people arose from one of hisredundant mystical powers—that is, one which he appeared to regard as adistraction to be avoided in the pursuit of alchemy. He had found in some oldmanuscript an algorithm or formula or perhaps simply a charm that, hediscovered, allowed him to predict the winning numbers in lotteries. (Lotterieswere all the rage at the time.) One hardly knows what to say about an occultgift that was a source of embarrassment to him rather than a stimulus toeconomic enterprise. Captain Scott and his friends by no means shared hisembarrassment, and they went to great lengths, including outright theft, to gettheir hands on the manuscript. One of the highly disconcerting features of the“historical problem” of Cagliostro is the copious evidence that manycontemporaries who hardly fit the profile of credulous dupes clearly believed inhis occult powers.As the months went by, things went from bad to worse. His life took on thecontours of a picaresque novel, but in it his role was that of prey, notpredator. He was gulled, abused, defrauded, deceived, lied to, and eventuallyconfined in a debtors’ prison. He had come to London from the Continent, as somany had before him, in search of “liberty.”A good deal of the count’s miserable experience in this London sojourn can beattributed to linguistic difficulties. The systematic study of modern foreignlanguages, with the partial exception of French, was rarely a part of the oldeducational system. Indeed, the old meaning of the word “literate”—indicating acapacity to read and write the Latin language—survived well into the eighteenthcentury. Whatever education the young Balsamo/Cagliostro had received in Italywould have been based in the ancient tongue, in which most of his alchemicalsources would also have been written, as well as much even contemporary medicalliterature. (Casanova’s claim that Cagliostro could read no language seems to beabsurd.) International travelers often learned the languages of their adoptedhomelands, to the extent they did learn them, by immersion in the culture.Standards were rather low. In England it was socially acceptable for an approvedvisitor speaking execrable English to mingle even in the best society.What is acceptable, however, is not always prudent or advantageous. Many ofCagliostro’s difficulties in London were initiated or exacerbated by his poorcommand of the native language. He more than once put his signature to a paperhe clearly had not read or understood. Trouble also came to him through hisdependence upon interpreters, such as the multilingual Portuguese MadameBlavery, who had early befriended Serafina. French he seems to have eventuallymastered to an acceptably proficient degree, and this allowed him to travel inMasonic circles in such places as Courland (the Baltic region), Poland, andRussia without ever having to use the local languages at all.images [../Images/p231.jpg]It is difficult to discern a wizard in this popular image of a domesticatedCount Cagliostro.His time in London was of course not merely a series of disasters andpersecutions. His declared intention was to concentrate on his chemicalinvestigations, and he did spend many hours in his laboratory. These efforts didnot exclude a healing ministry of a quasi-mesmeric character—though unlikeMesmer himself, Cagliostro did not undertake to heal in public, treating his“gift” as medical procedure rather than prodigy to be exhibited. He also yieldedto the importunities of many for various kinds of “spiritual consultations,”which were in effect séances as they would more fully develop in the nextcentury. There is a very clear lineal descent from Cagliostro to Madame HelenaBlavatsky a hundred years later. Indeed, Blavatsky wrote an essay on Cagliostro,in which she expressed a qualified admiration. According to her, allCagliostro’s problems derived from a single cause: his disastrous marriage toSerafina. This is an idea that reappears in various mutations throughout thepro-Cagliostro literature.As his séances were to become famous throughout Europe, we may say a word oftheir London origins. The word séance, “a sitting” as in the gathering of agroup or committee for consequential business, suggests the French origin of theinstitution, and French was the language normally employed. The meetings oftenbegan with a secular prayer for guidance or enlightenment directed to “the GreatArchitect of the Universe,” the standard Masonic appellation for God, which hadbecome general in such circles. Cagliostro often followed the French convention,also, of using children as the intermediaries of spiritual communication. Theidea of childish innocence is of nearly universal cultural appearance. Jesus ina famous saying had demanded that little children be allowed to approach him,“for of such is the kingdom of God.” The notion that children are closer to someprimal state of innocent felicity, only later to be ruined by thesophistications and corruptions of the world, is the subject of a famousRomantic poem, Wordsworth’s “Ode: Intimations of Immortality”:But trailing clouds of glory do we comeFrom God, who is our home:Heaven lies about us in our infancy!Shades of the prison-house begin to closeUpon the growing Boy …The terminology of these child mediums (as we have seen) was appropriatelytender: if male, pupille; if female, colombe. The frankness and freshness ofinfantile innocence was supposed to disarm the wariness of skeptics, but ofcourse from another perspective it might just as well increase it.Cagliostro’s formal initiation into the Masonic Order took place during thisperiod in London, but its actual details have been clouded by Masonic legend,one particularly fascinating detail being the suggestion that his sponsor wasthe famous comte de Saint-Germain. The blackmailer Morande, who does not makethat claim, reports that the initiation occurred at the Esperance Lodge, whichheld its meetings at the King’s Head in Gerard Street. This part is probablytrue, as it seems to be corroborated by the fact that the proprietor of theKing’s Head, a man named O’Reilly, later befriended Cagliostro during his worstdifficulties, and secured his release from jail.As no other opportunity will occur to introduce the sire deSaint-Germain—whether or not he had any actual part in Cagliostro’sFreemasonry—I must grasp this one. Auguste Viatte, whose Sources occultes duRomantisme remains after fifty years an indispensable guide, regardedSaint-Germain as the period’s most successful type of the occultist-adventurer.He was more successful than Cagliostro precisely in the fact that his incognitowas never penetrated, his true identity never revealed. In the murky world ofshadows in which he lived and operated, his strange teachings could more easilypass for light. For Saint-Germain there was no family Balsamo, and no meanstreets of Palermo. His mystery remained open-ended. So Pierre Chevallier, thepuckish historian of French Freemasonry, could summarize it thus: “Some believedthat he was the son of the widow of King Carlos II of Spain, Marie of Neufbourg;others took him for a Portuguese Jew.” Of course Cagliostro himself was also forsome a “Portuguese Jew,” for in all cases of uncertain identity in this period,whether one option be Venetian renegade, Polish hasid, Swedenborgian, radicalIlluminatus, or defrocked Carthusian, the other will undoubtedly be “PortugueseJew.”III. EgyptA strictly linear and chronological presentation of Cagliostro’s biography wouldbe insufficient, for the man was an anthology of themes as well as an actor in asuccession of events. In London he had dabbled in alchemy and practicedunconventional medicine—though less unconventional then than it would be now. Hehad held séances through which he claimed to be in touch with a spirit world andunseen realities. But nothing in his London career could have invited the venomof Carlyle toward a “Pupil of the Sage Althotas, Foster-child of the Scherif ofMecca, probable Son of the last King of Trebisond; named also Acharat, andUnfortunate Child of Nature …” All that was to come later, and it was allconnected with Caglistro’s commerce with Freemasonry—what he took from it, whathe gave back to it. We must pause to consider some of its implications.In an earlier chapter I sought to suggest that one of the mental discontinuitiesbetween the Old and New Worlds was a shift in the general attitude towardchange, which might be regarded from the pessimistic point of view as amanifestation of morbid mutability, or from the optimistic as progress.Naturally, such a large shift in perception would have implications for the ideaof learning itself. In fact an uneasy debate between old and new learning was afeature of Enlightenment thought, and the debate is not yet definitivelyresolved even today.As enshrined in the mission statements of many of our leading academies, theprincipal aims of learning have been two: the preservation of old knowledge andthe discovery of new. There are different ways of imagining the relationshipbetween the two, old knowledge and new knowledge. We often think of a “march” ofscience, a linear advance or progression, as from water power to steampower tothe power of the internal combustion engine. This mode of thinking might becalled the evolutionary theory. Alternatively, there is the popular notion ofthe “scientific revolution,” in which an idea or complex of ideas long regardedas settled is discredited, overthrown, discarded, and displaced by another.Human beings must have gazed with wonder at the night sky and pondered therising and the setting of the sun for as long as there has been sentient humanlife. The complex astronomical description published by Ptolemy in the secondcentury, a system based in close observation, mathematical calculation, andlogical deduction, satisfied scientific minds in Europe for more than amillennium. Then in a relatively short period of time the work of a relativelyfew men—Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler chief among them—rendered the Ptolemaicsystem obsolete and quaint.We continue, however, to speak of the “rising” and the “setting” of the sun inobeisance to the weight of a timeless habit and our common experience. In theOld World there was a quite different way of imagining the relationship betweenthe old learning and the new, and we find it enshrined in an ancient Latin poemthat up through the eighteenth century was among the most famous in the Westernliterary canon: Boethius’ meter on the Golden Age. In that poem most of what weusually think of as social “progress”—the movement from agrarian subsistence toa complex international money economy—is seen as a falling away from a primalinnocence and moral purity. It was for that reason that medieval and Renaissancemythographers so easily saw in the myth of the Golden Age a poetic parallel tothe scriptural account of the fall of man and the primal sin that “brought deathinto the world, and all our woes.”The various and perhaps competing “rites” of eighteenth-century Masonry presenta challenge to their historian, for it is not always easy to distinguish clearlybetween essence and ornament. The distinction in Masonic rites was perhaps moresimilar to the distinction between religious orders in the Roman Church than todenominations among the Protestants, but it was often of burning interest to theMasons themselves. Cagliostro presented himself not as the inventor of a newrite but as the revealer of one as ancient as the Sphinx. This was the so-calledEgyptian rite. Its French foundation was surrounded by flamboyant mumbo-jumbo.He claimed to act upon the urgings of his own private genius, the Grand Copht,of whom he was an incarnation or reincarnation. (The ancient word “Copt,” nowused only of the remaining indigenous Christians, originally meant “Egyptian.”)Cagliostro would later supplement the operations of the originating lodge in therue de la Soudière in Paris with a private Temple of Isis at which he presided.All this was perhaps a mighty maze—but not without a plan.The phenomenon of Egyptomania (often called by the French scholars Egyptophilia)must be distinguished from Egyptology, the scientific study of the Egyptianantiquities associated with the name of Champollion, the archaeologist whosupervised the scientific side of Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition. Yet as thehistorian Jean Leclant has shown in a delicate essay, the two are on a continuumalong which it is not easy to find a definitive division point. EuropeanEgyptomania was a Renaissance project continued with distinctive Enlightenmentflourishes in the eighteenth century. One can go further and point to itsadumbrations in classical antiquity, seized upon by Florentine Christianphilosophical mystics such as Ficino and Pico in the fifteenth century. Plutarchand Jamblicus were among the ancient “Egyptologists.” The myth of Toth, thelegendary god of pharaonic wisdom, informed the famous collection of esotericwritings (the Corpus Hermeticum) attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, thrice-greatHermes, his Hellenistic Greek doppelganger.The Renaissance Egyptophiles had been particularly fascinated by thehieroglyphic writing system. For the very reason that nobody could decipherthem, the hieroglyphs were the visible proof that there was somethingfundamentally true about the idea of a “lost” or “secret” ancient knowledge.There is a parallel here to the rebirth among Christian intellectuals of aninterest in the number symbolism of Jewish kabbala, which also became anenthusiasm, often among the same scholars. The early European Egyptophiles didnot regard the hieroglyphic system as the written form of a conventional signsystem like Greek or Latin, but as a secret or mysterious code requiring anesoteric initiation, and this idea did not vanish entirely even with thediscovery of the Rosetta Stone, which was in effect an Egyptian-Greekdictionary. The very name “hieroglyph” (sacred carving or inscription) couldhave been devised only by someone unable to read a hieroglyph. There seems to bea natural tendency to imagine that things said or written in a language one doesnot understand are likely to be more weighty than they actually are. Those whofirst called the ancient Germanic graphic system “runes” (secret lore) wereilliterates for whom any writing whatsoever must perforce be “secret.”Egyptomania took a great leap forward among the erudite when, in the middle ofthe seventeenth century, the polymath genius Athanasius Kircher, of the Societyof Jesus, published his huge Oedipus Aegyptiacus (4 volumes, 1652–54). I do notpretend to have read this book in its entirely, and would be forced to doubteither the veracity or the sanity of anyone claiming to have done so. But itsprofusion of erudition, information, misinformation, and beautifully erroneousspeculation provided Egyptophiles with an inexhaustible sourcebook for more thana century. It was, incidentally, a typically “Enlightenment” encyclopedicundertaking, one of the earlier attempts at a universal field theory of allknown philosophical, mythic, and religious systems.Egyptophilia from early times also contained an important element ofarchitectural enthusiasm, especially with regard to the ruined temples on theNile and the pyramids in the desert, and it was this element that is naturallymost prominent in Freemasonry. The concept of the “mystical” architectural unitis not entirely imaginary. There is plenty of evidence that from very ancienttimes “secret” or “mystical” Pythagorean numerical conceptions were used in thelaying out of important buildings, the most common being the so-called goldensection, or division by mean and extreme ratio. The medieval Christianarchitects continued the “esoteric” architectural ideas in the system called adquadratum, not infrequently adding decorative elements taken from theallegorical interpretations of the Scriptures. By the eighteenth century mostMasons believed not merely that “the” Egyptian Pyramid could teach esoteric lorethrough its mathematical proportions, but that it was an actual repository orlibrary of as yet undiscovered hermetic teachings and that, furthermore, itsvast stone mass had in ancient times housed an actual academy of esotericism, inwhich the happy few were initiated into the secrets of Pharaonic wisdom.One of the perennially engaging branches of the novel is the story ofinitiation, in which some young worthy is educated by a wise elder in thesecrets of the art or tribe. One artistic convenience for the writer of such abook is that the plot can be pretty perfunctory, since the principal interestfor both the writer and the reader is in the body of material taught. There arenumerous examples from the period of the Enlightenment, two of the most famousbeing the Telemachus of Archbishop Fénelon and the Travels of Cyrus by theChevalier Ramsay. The two are related, as Ramsay, a Scots Jacobite and animportant figure in the early history of Freemasonry in France, was Fénelon’sdisciple in both a figurative and a literal sense, having been converted toRoman Catholicism by him. (Open warfare between Catholicism and Freemasonrybroke out only under Pope Clement XII in 1738, and even then it was notuniversal.)Telemachus was of course the son of Ulysses and Penelope, and Fénelon’s book isa kind of lost chapter of the Odyssey in which the young man is instructed byhis sage and venerable tutor, Mentor—with such success as to turn an uncommonGreek personal name into a common English noun. In Ramsay’s novel concerning thephilosophical training of the great Persian king Cyrus, it is the educationalaspect of peregrination that is stressed. The pupil learns not merely throughexplicit tuition but from the observation of the world’s great variety of “menand morals.” Near the end of the century the Catholic Theosophist, alchemist,numerologist, and enthusiastic Egyptophile Karl von Eckharthausen published hismystic initiation novel, Kostis Reise von Morgen gegen Mittag (The Journey ofPrince Kosti from Morning to Noon). Ironic or satirical variations on the basictheme will be found in such famous books of the eighteenth century as Swift’sGulliver’s Travels (1726) and Voltaire’s Candide (1759). At one level theTravels of Cyrus is a testimony to a concept still current, the virtues ofcosmopolitanism, a concept that took concrete form in the eighteenth century inthe idea of the Grand Tour.The most relevant of such books for Egyptian Freemasonry, by the abbé Terrasson,drew heavily on both Telemachus and the Travels of Cyrus. Its title is The Lifeof Sethos (1731 in French, 1732 in English). Sethos is the name of an ancientEgyptian king mentioned in the pages of Herodotus. It does not hurt that it alsolooks like a Greek form of the biblical name Seth, the mysterious “replacement”son sired by Adam in his one hundred and thirtieth year. To this name, otherwisehighly obscure, the French author was able to attach his vastly popular “historyof the education of a prince.” It is the old story of the dusty manuscript foundfloating in a bottle or buried in a chest. This one, in Greek, was foundapparently in some Levantine library. Its curators were so sensitive as to grantpermission for its publication only with the stipulation that the location ofthe library never be named.Having essayed such a whopper in his preface, Terrasson is willing to push hisluck no further. Though the story of the manuscript is truth, the story withinthe manuscript is fiction—exemplary fiction of a very special kind. The authormakes a distinction between history, which teaches its moral lessons only slowlyand presents the nuggets buried in piles of ore and slag that must be tediouslysearched, and moral fiction, in which a reader may find history’s concentratedmoral elixir. “We might combine and melt down numbers of the great men inhistory before we should find those materials for wonder and imitation which ajudicious author will often produce in but a small part of the life of anysingle hero.”The education of young Sethos involves plenty of travel, but there is a definiteemphasis on “daily life in ancient Egypt.” Much of the formal tuition takesplace in and around “the” Pyramid, or in the temples of Memphis, and it involvesrepeated “initiations,” formal introductions to mysteries of incremental import.The parallels with the “degrees” of Masonry are obvious; but scholars have beendivided as to whether the author of Sethos was taking his mysteries from Masonicpractice already current, or, on the other hand, that the Masons wereconstructing their mysteries from the pages of Sethos.Art imitates life, which quickly forecloses on the debt by imitating art. Themost absurd document in the Cagliostro dossier, certainly the one that hasinvited the most complacent ridicule, is the “autobiographical” statement takendown during the criminal investigation at the time of the Affair of the DiamondNecklace. According to that document Cagliostro claimed, among other things, tobe as ageless as the Pyramid, to have learned his esoteric arts in the school ofan Eastern sage, and to be himself the “Grand Copht.” Perhaps anyone making sucha statement to the police authorities deserves whatever historical obloquy maycome his way; but even historical censoriousness might be tempered by anevaluation of the moral authority of Louis XVI’s police.There have been several dozens of more or less scholarly studies devoted toCagliostro. Even Carlyle’s essay, famous though it became, was far from thefirst. The most profound, in my view, is the old book of Emmanuel Lalande (1912)entitled Le Maitre Inconnu Cagliostro (The Unknown Teacher Cagliostro) andsubtitled “An Historical and Critical Study of the ‘High Magic.’ ” Lalande, whowrote under the pseudonym of Marc Haven, was a Christian cabbalist andesotericist, and one of the principal continuers through the Belle Epoque of theeighteenth-century tradition of “Martinism”—meaning the doctrines and school ofthe lay mystic Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin (1743–1803). With such adescription, however summary, it is probably unnecessary to add that hisreputation for eccentricity has been controversial; but there is worse. He wasthe successor and collaborator of Gérard Encausse (pseudonym Papus), the mostimportant figure in nineteenth-century Martinism, and an anti-Semite of such astripe as to have invited the charge (false, in actual fact) of having been theforger of the notorious Protocols of the Elders of Zion.Lalande was, however, a considerable scholar, and his Unknown Teacher, the fruitof twenty years of laborious primary research, is in a class by itself. In anepilogue that in its poetic spirit strives for that of the old wizard himself,he not so much refutes Carlyle as speaks past or beyond him. What, asks Lalande,are we to make of Cagliostro’s bizarre statements? He then answers his ownquestion with an extended quotation, with commentary, from Cagliostro’s longernarrative statement to the police: “I do not come from any particular time orplace. My spiritual being lives out its eternal existence outside of time andspace; and if in my thoughts I plumb the depths of the ages, if I stretch myessence toward a mode of being distant from that you perceive, I become what Idesire to be … Here I am, a noble traveller. I speak and your soul thrills inrecognition of the ancient words. A voice within you, so long silent, respondsto mine.…”The advantage gained by presenting the police report in this fashion, ratherthan as a series of discreet assertions from a legal disposition, is that areader can recognize Cagliostro’s actual literary genre, which is poeticmysticism. A paraphrase yet better, perhaps, is the once famous “Ode” of the nowforgotten Victorian poet William O’Shaughnessy:We are the music makers,And we are the dreamers of dreams,Wandering by lone sea-breakers,And sitting by desolate streams;—World-losers and world-forsakers,On whom the pale moon gleams:Yet we are the movers and shakersOf the world for ever, it seems …In the buried past of the earth,Built Nineveh with our sighing,And Babel itself in our mirth;And o’erthrew them with prophesyingTo the old of the new world’s worth;For each age is a dream that is dying,Or one that is coming to birth.Cagliostro’s fictive autobiography is a kind of self-fashioning that puts himwithin the literary tradition of eighteenth-century philosophicalpseudo-biography and “travel” literature. He is a new yet eternal Telemachus, orCyrus, or Sethos, both surrogate pupil and surrogate tutor. The Egyptian Sethosis the most important of all. When assigning himself a possible earthlybirthplace in his spiritual autobiography, Cagliostro had hesitated betweenMalta and Medina; yet he never hesitated in claiming an Egyptian source of the“wisdom.”The influential concept of “Orientalism” as a web of scholarlymisrepresentations that, either by design or by accident, assert Westerncultural superiority and justify the colonial mentality has not considered animportant Western tradition that has seen the West as a kind of infantile pupilof Eastern wisdom. The persistence of the trope of “Eastern wisdom,” andespecially esoteric wisdom, would probably make the subject of a rewardingstudy. Cagliostro’s fantastic testimony of long years spent in Medina studyingEastern science, or in discussing Egyptian philosophy with the mufti, reveal hischaracteristic garbo, but the “trope” itself already had a lengthy history.According to the Rosicrucian Fama Fraternitatis, Brother Christian Rosenkreuzhad spent three years of study at Damcar and two more at Fez, then capped offthe study tour with a brief sojourn in Egypt. “Damcar” is the modern Dhamar insouthwest Yemen. Its legendary associations are with the ancient kingdom ofSheba (Saba), whose queen, also called the Queen of the South, famously visitedSolomon (I Kings 10:1–10) to search out his wisdom. The extended biblicalaccount has many of the themes so fundamental to the imagination of Freemasonry:desert travel, the gold of Ophir, priceless spices in abundance, “ivory, apes,and peacocks,” Solomon, the Temple. Rosenkreuz studied natural philosophy (i.e.,“science”), mathematics, and magic. In Egypt he specialized in botany, a subjectindispensable to the healer for the preparation of his remedies, elixirs,cordials, and potions.There was another dimension of “Easternness,” namely, its obvious literalassociations with Enlightenment. “All light comes from the East, all initiation,from Egypt.” Eighteenth-century esotericism, secular and anti-clerical though itoften was, nonetheless aligned itself, imaginatively, with various real orimagined reformers of earlier Christian ascetic life. The most obvious generalexample was that of the Templars. The last Grand Master of the Temple, Jacquesde Molay, is a cardinal figure in the legendary history of Masonry. Cagliostrohimself maintained a continuing fascination with the Hospitallers of St. John,who after the fall of Rhodes to the Ottoman invaders were making the last standof medieval military asceticism and the crusading ideal on the island of Malta.The common ideographic link here is with the restoration of Solomon’s Temple inJerusalem, but there is another. Just as “secular” esoteric knowledge came fromthe East, so had spiritual esoteric knowledge. The philosophes rejectedChristianity in its supernatural pretensions and did what they could toundermine its historical support. Many of the esotericists, on the other hand,claimed that they were recovering the “perennial philosophy,” the truths ofChristianity in its primitive and uncorrupted form. They regarded themselves asreformers, and aligned themselves with the reformers of history. The greatreform of monasticism in twelfth-century Europe, centered in France, hadimagined itself as a return to the fervor and discipline of the eremites ofancient Egypt, Paul and Anthony, the legendary founders of Christian religiouslife. In a very famous phrase William of Saint-Thierry, one of the giants of theCistercian reform, had written of the orientale lumen, the ancient wisdom of thereligious life of the Egyptians.Cagliostro seems already in 1777, before his establishment of the first Egyptianrite lodge, to have settled upon this Egyptian myth as the proper vehicle of hisown program for the spiritual and intellectual renewal of Christendom, a programthat he set out to prosecute with something of the astonishing daring of theauthors of the old Rosicrucian manifestos.IV. The Wheel of FameCagliostro left London in late 1777 in retreat. Whatever his aims had been inthe British capital, he had failed. But by the time he arrived in Courland lessthan eighteen months later, he was a famous man, once again inexplicablyfinancially comfortable, and welcomed, indeed sought after by the rich men andilluminated ones of the Masonic lodges. It is odd that these very months areshrouded with a documentary silence. All Cagliostro himself has said is this:“My fifty guineas, which was all that I possessed on leaving London, took me asfar as Brussels, where I found Providence waiting to replenish my purse.” Heshould have used the plural pronoun for now, as always, he traveled with hiswife. We must fall back on the highly unreliable testimony of the Inquisitionbiography, and of other mainly negative notices that appeared from time to timein the gossip of the international press.He was in Brussels, at The Hague, in Nuremberg. According to his enemies heappeared in Venice under the assumed name of Pellegrini, which as it simplymeans “Pilgrims” very much fits in with his self-image as waif, as “unfortunatetraveler,” and as one whose true home is elsewhere than this terrestrial globe.It was apparently in Nuremberg that he for the first time revealed, or perhapsinvented, his once famous device. Encountering a fellow Mason—a dailyoccurrence, of course—he let drop the “Mason word,” and responded to the man’srequest to know his identity by drawing the emblem of the ourobos—a serpentcircled with its own tail in its mouth:images [../Images/p245.jpg]Mystifications of this sort were very characteristic of the man, who frequentlyperformed gestures or utterances incomprehensible in themselves but hinting at ameaning available to the enlightened. They had a useful purpose beyond the meredrama. They implied, like the old alchemical and Rosicrucian symbols from whichthey derived, the intimacy of a shared illumination. So far as Masonic mysteriesmight be concerned, one either got it or one didn’t.The emblem of the ourobos says, “In my end is my beginning”—the motto that thedoomed Mary Queen of Scots had embroidered in her linen, and that T. S. Eliot,hardly less mysteriously than Cagliostro himself, made the epigraph of “EastCoker.” The reader knows it has to mean something important—but what? The emblemadded to the man’s fame, which now went before him. Cagliostro’s quasi-apostolictour eastward and northward continued. At some places he was warmly welcomed, inothers less warmly; but he hit the Masonic jackpot, so to speak, in the lodge atMitau. It was a case of the right place at the right time—and with the rightpeople. “As hitherto the cause of Egyptian Masonry does not appear to havederived any material benefit from the great interest he is said to have excitedin Leipzig and other places,” writes Trowbridge, “it seems reasonable to inferthat the lodges he frequented were composed of bourgeois or uninfluentialpersons.” The Mitau lodge, on the other hand, was full of occultists of highstation, headed by the brothers von Medem, aristocratic children ofEnlightenment, whose alchemical and magical enthusiasms went far beyond vulgarcuriosity or greed. They were rich patrons in search of a Rosicrucian paladin,and they found him in Cagliostro.Yet more important for Cagliostro’s fortunes was the remarkable daughter of theCount von Medem, Elisa. This beautiful woman, still young, was brilliant,learned, mystical, religious, independent-minded, and bored. She had been sobored by her conventional husband the Count von der Recke, whom she had marriedas a child in filial duty, that she soon separated from him. She soughtenlightenment. In a series of mesmeric healings, clairvoyant predictions, andmysterious séances, Cagliostro captured this woman’s attention and—at least to asufficient degree—her credence. It is impossible to see their relationshipmerely in terms of a fraudster and his dupe, for a dupe Elisa von der Recke wasnot. But with the wizard’s encouragement she came to view his marvelous deedsand occult gifts as the outward, sacramental signs of an inner and spiritualbenevolence. He was, as he said, “the friend of mankind.” He possessed, as heclaimed, an ancient wisdom, that same wisdom of which Augustine had once criedout, “Sero te amavi . . .”—“too late have I loved Thee, O Beauty, ancient yetnew!” He and he alone brought out the Egyptian in her.Realpolitik comes in many forms. In order to win the game, one must first playthe game. The would-be political reformer cannot exercise power without firstachieving it. Cagliostro tried to walk the thin, taut line between the vaticmoralism of a proto-Rosicrucian regeneration of the world and the more materialaspirations of occult practice. However, he overplayed his hand with theCountess Elisa. One of the most mysterious of Bible passages is the following(Genesis 6:4): “There were giants on the earth in those days, and alsoafterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they borechildren to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.” Inone of his habitual prefatory lectures on Egyptian Masonry, Cagliostro, an earlycomparative religionist, applied this text both to the demigods of Greekmythology, and to Jesus, born of a union of the Holy Spirit and an earthlywoman. He then added, apparently as filler, that he himself was the product ofsuch a union.That would be the parting of the ways. The countess was still too much of aChristian to suffer the implied blasphemy, and she eventually published abook—Nachricht von des berühmten Cagliostro Aufenthalt in Mitau im Jahre 1779und dessen magischen Operationen, or An Account of the Famous Sojourn ofCagliostro in Mitau and of his Magical Operations—in which she declared him animposter. Its negative tone has done much to solidify the historical legend. Butthe book appeared nearly a decade after the events with which it dealt, andafter the Affair of the Diamond Necklace had permanently if unfairly linked thename of Cagliostro with scandal. When Cagliostro moved on, first to St.Petersburg and then to Warsaw—in both of which places he was lauded by some anddenounced by others, honored or “unmasked” by a divided public opinion—he hadalready gained his reputation as the most famous or infamous occult practitionerin Europe. He would be watched by the police wherever he went, but alsopatronized by the high and mighty.Cagliostro left Warsaw in late June 1780. The verb preferred by his detractorswas that he fled the place. He resurfaced in Strassburg about three monthslater, transported in an imposing, expensive carriage and attended by lackeys.He immediately established himself in upscale digs, where he again deployed theparaphernalia of an alchemist and a medical man. Where had he been during theinterim period? “Cagliostro … has always been supposed, on grounds that all butamount to proof, to have been at some period in his mysterious career connectedwith one of the revolutionary secret societies in Germany,” writes Trowbridge.“This society has always been assumed to be the Illuminés.” The chiefjustification for the assumption is the significant overlap in membershipbetween the Egyptian Masons and the Illuminati. “If this assumption be true—andwithout it his mode of life in Strassburg is utterly inexplicable—his initiationcould only have taken place at this period and, probably, at Frankfort, where[Adolf] Knigge, one of the leaders of the Illuminés, had his head-quarters.”Here was Freemasonry at its most political and conspiratorial; and the “Germanpolice-spies” whom Karl Marx would make forever famous in the CommunistManifesto were hardly unaware of its potential menace. Cagliostro’s subsequentsensational difficulties, first in France, then in England, and finally in thedungeons of the Inquisition, have too seldom been viewed from the politicalpoint of view.Cagliostro’s protracted stay in Strassburg may be regarded as the apogee of hiscareer as popular wonder-worker. It was there that the graph of his good fortunereached its most impressive height. We have considerable evidence concerningthis protracted stay. One testimony is of particular interest, and refreshing inthat it comes not as a libel or a police report but in the memoirs of aparticularly knowledgeable and intelligent Alsatian aristocrat, the Baronessd’Oberkirch.Before turning to it, however, it is necessary to say a word or two aboutStrassburg itself. Though more a sizable town than a real city, Strassburg inthe late eighteenth century was a place of political significance andintellectual vitality, the chief city of the area that was France’s culturallyfruitful borderland. Alsace was in those days much more genuinely biculturalthan it is today: 1780 was not 1870, and the ferocities of nationalconsciousness that dominated the “question” of Alsace and Lorraine in theFranco-Prussian and then again in the Great War had not yet been animated. Theregion where today Germany, France, and Switzerland meet was both a linguisticand a religious frontier. The French and German languages came together; andProtestantism rubbed up against Catholicism. For travelers from theGerman-speaking regions, as indeed those from eastern Europe and the land of theczars, Strassburg was the first city “in” France, just as later for the Frenchfugitives of the Revolution, Koblenz would become the first city “in” Germany.As we shall see when we come in another chapter to the remarkable career ofJulie de Krüdener, it was a nursery also of mysticism and esoteric philosophies,the sort of place in which a Grand Copht of Egyptian Freemasonry might findhimself at home.Henriette-Louise de Waldner de Freundstein, the future Madame d’Oberkirch, wasborn in 1754 on her family’s ancestral estate at Schweighouse in upper Alsacenear Colmar. Both her parents were of the highest Alsatian aristocracy. She wasan unusually intelligent and able young woman, and she exploited to the full herexcellent education, and the opportunity and encouragement to cultivate herconsiderable talents in art and music. The family was of the Lutheranconfession, and Madame d’Oberkirch was a serious but hardly morose Protestant. Afeature of the comparative cosmopolitanism of the Alsatian aristocracy was analmost modern religious pluralism. She was perfectly bilingual in French andGerman and commanded other languages ancient and modern. She wrote her Mémoiresin French, which tended to be the literary (and often the conversational)language of the Continental aristocracy from Lisbon to St. Petersburg.The cardinal de Rohan, a famous conversationalist himself, declared Oberkirch tobe among the three most fascinating women of his acquaintance—an acquaintancequite extensive in that category. She indeed fits the profile of a certain kindof “Enlightenment woman.” One recalls the aristocratic philosopher Anne Conwayof a hundred years earlier, the woman whose migraines had defeated thetherapeutic efforts of Greatrakes the Stroker. The baroness had a wide networkof connections within the intelligentsia, and she corresponded with several ofthe luminaries of her age, including Johann Kaspar Lavater, the poet, mystic,and scientist who was the theoretician of the once popular science ofphysiognomy. (We must remember that science becomes pseudo-science only bymajority vote.)It was at Saverne near Strassburg, in Rohan’s episcopal palace “worthy of aking,” that the baroness met the count of Cagliostro, whose arrival interruptedthe cardinal’s accounts of his recent travels and, in particular, of his idea ofraising a monument to the memory of the great French general Turenne, on thebattlefield of Sasbach where he had fallen in 1675. Cagliostro’s fame hadpreceded him. Toward the end of November 1780, the baroness had arrived inStrassburg for a short stay. “Upon arriving there,” she writes, “we found thatall the talk was of a charlatan who had become famous, and who was pursuing withrare skill the high-jinks [jongleries] which brought him to play so strange arole.”Oberkirch’s testimony has several times been used to disparage Cagliostro. It iscertainly far from flattering or credulous. But the word “charlatan” had not yetsolidified into a mere reproach. A “charlatan,” which had originally meant astreet crier, or hawker, by now usually referred to the practitioners ofinformal or “alternative” medicine—folk doctors or quacks. If one looks closelyat the professional medicine to which quackery was “alternative,” however, thehierarchical relationship of medicine and quackery may seem less certain than itdoes today.One of the problems in assessing Cagliostro is the nature of the evidence. Thesame problem faces the historian of nineteenth-century Spiritualism, since manyof his procedures were similar if not identical to those of the later “mediums.”The historians of Spiritualism have been either its apologists or its debunkers.The former have been evangelists and apologists with the enthusiasm ofevangelists and the partiality of apologists. The latter have of course scoffedat the very idea of an “impartial” assessment of phenomena for which the onlyexplanation must be fraud or delusion. What is most interesting to me about thebaroness’s testimony is not that “she saw through Cagliostro,” as has been said,but that she recognized amid the charlatanisme and the jongleries an element ofthe mysterious, the enigmatic, the inexplicable—and the beneficent. “I am goingto relate what I saw, quite sincerely,” she writes, “leaving it to my readers tojudge those things that I was unable to understand.”What she saw primarily was a remarkable display of thaumaturgy differing indegree rather than in kind from that of Greatrakes the Stroker a centuryearlier. Cagliostro was credited with achieving dozens and perhaps hundreds of“cures” of hard cases. He acted always, as Greatrakes had himself, with anostentatious denial of the direct financial gain his medical practice easilycould have won him. Like Greatrakes, too, his unconventional medicine sufferedthe obloquy of the medical establishment.His satisfied patients spanned the entire social spectrum. One interesting,perhaps titillating, aspect of his practice was his supposed expertise in thedelicate questions of fertility. In an age in which the continuation ofbloodlines still had enormous financial importance, infertility was more oftenregarded as a social disaster than a personal grief. Among several well-knownwomen who sought consultations at his “fertility clinic” was the Dutch writerIsabelle de Charrière, alias Belle van Zuylen (1740–1805). He also secured achild for the aging Swiss banker Sarazin—and with it the useful “corporatesponsorship” of Egyptian Freemasonry.In the aristocratic circles of Strassburg, Cagliostro gained the fame usuallyreserved in that age for military heroes or child musical prodigies. He heldastounding séances. His one-man free clinic ministered—if we are to believe onecontemporary historian who was on the spot—to no fewer than fifteen thousandsuffering patients. (That would be upward of fifty a day over the course of ayear!) He performed feats of clairvoyance ranging from the humdrum (locatingmislaid pieces of property) to the sensational. The empress Maria Theresa, themother of the French queen, died on November 19, 1780. It is about eight hundredmiles from Vienna to Paris. Ordinary carriage travel might be as slow as thirtymiles a day, and even the fastest express relay couriers would require upward ofa week. Cagliostro, newly arrived in Strassburg, had quite publicly (anddaringly) predicted her death to Cardinal Rohan, with whom he had alreadyingratiated himself. “He even foretold the hour at which she would expire,”writes Madame d’Oberkirch. “Monsieur de Rohan told it me in the evening, and itwas five days after that the news arrived.”Cagliostro’s association with the cardinal de Rohan would soon enough provedisastrous for the enlightened wizard. For the moment it was about to secure hisentrée into the very highest circles of Parisian society. For Cardinal Rohan,Grand Almoner of France, bishop of Strassburg, and (to Cagliostro’s delight) thetitular bishop of Canopus in Egypt, owned, in addition to his lavish Alsatianestate, a great house in the capital. One of the cardinal’s cousins and Parisianneighbors, the prince de Soubise, at that moment lay dying in his own hôtelparticulier. All conventional medicine had failed. Under these circumstancescardinal de Rohan transported the charlatan to Paris in his own carriage,identifying him vaguely only as a “doctor” in order to avoid the hostility ofthe real doctors already in attendance, who had however by that time given upall hope.Cagliostro performed a “miracle cure” in the most impressive manner.Ostentatiously taking from his traveling case a small glass flask filled with anunidentified liquid, he banished everyone but the comatose patient from theroom. After a mysterious interval he called the cardinal back into the room andmade the following pronouncement: “If my prescription is followed” (theprescription being a specific schedule for the administration of drops of theliquid) “in two days Monseigneur will leave his bed and walk about the room.Within a week he will be able to take a drive, and within three to go to Court.”All of these things happened exactly as predicted—to the astonished delight ofthe family de Rohan and the ill-concealed discomfort of the establishmentphysicians. Everything now seemed propitious for Count Cagliostro’s campaign toconquer the French capital as he had conquered Strassburg.BibliographicalSome of the problems of the biography of Cagliostro are dealt with directly inthe text. The once famous essay of Carlyle has proved the beginning of a longdialogue. There are literally dozens of books about Cagliostro, including manyin English. W. R. H. Trowbridge’s Cagliostro: Savant or Scoundrel? (1911) brokenew ground in moving toward a more positive view of its subject. It fell intothe public domain and has been republished under various titles. More recentEnglish biographies include Raymond Silva’s Joseph Balsamo alias Cagliostro(Geneva, 1975) and Iain McCalman’s The Last Alchemist: Count Cagliostro Masterof Magic in the Age of Reason (New York, 2003).The subtitle of many of Cagliostro’s biographies has come in the form of anadversarial binary question: saint or sinner, charlatan or healer, con man orsavant? Before Trowbridge (who also used the format but left the answer amystery), all the answers were negative. In 1912 in Paris, Marc Haven (pseudonymof Emmanuel Lalande) published his life’s work, Le Maître Inconnu Cagliostro.This book has been the beginning of a major historical revision, exemplifiedmost recently by some of the essays in the scholarly anthology Presenza diCagliostro, ed. Daniela Gallingani (Florence, 1991), and Paolo Cortesi,Cagliostro: Maestro Illuminato o vulgare impostore? (Rome, 2004).Among excellent backgrounds works for materials in this chapter are FrancesMossiker’s The Queen’s Necklace (1961) and the splendid old two volumes ofCaptain the Honorable D. Bingham’s architectural “biography” The Bastille, Vols.11 and 12 of the Versailles Memoirs (New York, 1921).

Revelations fromcardinal de Rohan’s trial, far from vindicating Marie-Antoinette as the queenhad naively hoped, exacerbated her already bad popular reputation. There wereseveral published sketches of the fabulous necklace.7 Cagliostro Declining [../Text/content.xhtml#ch7]A COMPREHENSIVE SKETCH OF Cagliostro’s operations in Paris and elsewhere inFrance, especially at Lyon, would divert us from the disasters that now cameupon him, which have accounted for the large historical misunderstanding of theschool of Thomas Carlyle. The precipitating crisis was his association—a purelyaccidental association—with the Affair of the Diamond Necklace. This mostfascinating historical episode of the Ancien Régime—part high romance, partmoral satire, part true crime story—did far more than ruin Cagliostro. Itelectrified all of Paris and all of France. It became the gossip of a continent.And it drove another nail into the coffin of the Bourbon monarchy.My first extensive reading concerning the Affair of the Diamond Necklace was inthe book by Frantz Funck-Brentano (L’affaire du collier, 1901). Funck-Brentanowas an old-fashioned chartiste, a graduate of the famous École des Chartes inParis, the “library school” that has trained several generations of the world’smost distinguished archivists, curators, codicologists, and rare booklibrarians. He worked for long years at the Arsenal Library, extensively miningin a series of important studies its rich lodes of documentary sourcesillustrative of the Ancien Régime. A century of cultural change in the academyhas left him very much out of fashion. Conservative if not reactionary in hispolitical leanings, he was likewise conservative in literary and historicalmethod, one who believed in letting “the documents themselves tell the story.”But of course documents do not actually tell stories. People who read andinterpret documents tell stories, a fact as true for Funck-Brentano as forThomas Carlyle. L’affaire du collier is novelistic in technique and flavor. Itis not possible to transform archival documents, even personal letters, into theimaginary conversations that enliven Funck-Brentano’s book without imposinginterpretations upon them. In any human drama there are people, events, motives.The actual events of this episode are pretty confidently known. Yet ambiguityshimmers over certain aspects of character and therefore necessarily also ofmotive. The problem is particularly acute as regards Count Cagliostro, but ittouches also the principals. Even after I had begun writing this chapter, I cameupon Charles Shyer’s beautiful film The Affair of the Necklace (2001). Theprincipal female “lead” in the historical affair of the diamond necklace was ayoung woman named Jeanne de La Motte. In the pages of Funck-Brentano, she comesacross as something of a Moll Flanders. As interpreted by Shyer and ablyimpersonated by the beautiful Hilary Swank, she is much nearer to Mattie Ross inTrue Grit—a plucky daughter struggling in a man’s world to avenge a wronginflicted upon a noble, murdered father.The old documents preserved in historical archives may prove insufficient tosatisfy certain generic requirements of a Hollywood costume drama, particularlythose relating to horses, to fencing technique, and to human copulation. Evenacceding to that reality one must say that Frantz Funck-Brentano and CharlesShyer, while telling radically different stories of the diamond necklace, bothtell remarkably plausible and coherent ones. The same may be said of numerousother historical treatments of the episode, including a very readable andsubstantial book written for a general audience by Frances Mossiker, whichincorporate in translation a large number of the surviving primary documents,allowing every reader to become a research scholar.My interest in this chapter is not the indeterminacy of history, but the roleplayed by Count Cagliostro in one of the greatest confidence swindles everrecorded. The two cannot be entirely separated, however. Cagliostro’sassociation with the affair has been, in the historical record, one of thedarkest stains upon his character. That he had some role is certain, but the twochief possibilities—that of engaged conspirator on the one hand, and of innocentbystander on the other—are separated by a large ethical distance. We are wont toappeal to “history” as though it were something fixed and definite like atombstone, but as history happens it is often kinetic, fast-moving, potential.Quite often in history things might have turned out different. Here an analogybetter than the stone monument might be the battlefield or sports arena at thevery highest pitch of agonistic contest. In the Affair of the NecklaceCagliostro, already one of history’s more mysterious characters, was ininteraction with many others of like kind, and all of them moving with the speedand erratic path of soccer players on a pitch.Historians are not of one mind concerning the larger significance of the affair,but most are inclined to give it some importance as a prelude to the Revolutionand its sanguinary episode of the public execution of Queen Marie-Antoinette.The episode reeked of the excess and decadence of the doomed aristocracy andcontributed materially to burgeoning popular animosity toward the queen. Thequeen herself might rightly consider herself a victim.I. A Strange AllianceThe principals in the Affair of the Necklace, its vixen and its goose, so tospeak, were two remarkable specimens of that age, Madame de La Motte and thecardinal de Rohan. The reader needs an introduction to the former, and a fulleraccount of the latter than has so far been supplied.i. Jeanne de La Motte ValoisThe Valois dynasty of France provided French monarchs from the late Middle Agesthrough the reign of Henry III, who died in 1589. When the male heirs of thedirect line became exhausted, the crown devolved according to the Salic Law tothe Bourbon family, which supplied two centuries’ worth of royalty, includingthe various Louises of the Ancien Régime, so well known to us from the historybooks. There remained, of course, many Valois descendants of varying degrees ofobscurity and of propinquity to the old royal line. One such was a penuriousfarmer in the Aube named Jacques de Saint-Rémy de Valois. Among his children wasa daughter Jeanne (born in 1756), who became the central figure in the intrigueunder discussion. The family, or at least a part of it that included Jeanne, waslater rescued from rural poverty by charitable benefactors, the Boulainvilliers,who removed them to a more genteel home nearer Paris. The family Boulainvilliershad connections with Alsace, and were well acquainted with the bishop ofStrassburg.Though she served her requisite dull time in a convent school, young Jeanne,beautiful and apparently unscrupulous, was wistfully aware that Valois bloodflowed through her veins, and she hoped for better days. One day, the marquisede Boulainvilliers was traveling in her coach with Jeanne de Valois when hercoachman saw approaching the distinctive and sumptuous conveyance of her friendthe bishop of Strassburg, Cardinal Louis de Rohan. The coachmen stopped, and theoccupants exchanged pleasantries. The marquise introduced her charge to thebishop. This was the beginning of a connection between the cardinal and theattractive young woman that she exploited in various ways. She interested him inher supposed claims to her family’s lost property, now in the possession of thecrown, and sought his help in framing legal appeals.Likewise through the family Boulainvilliers Jeanne met and later married amilitary man slightly her senior though not manifestly of higher moral characterthan herself, Marc-Antoine-Nicolas de La Motte, who later styled himself thecomte de La Motte. He was probably a count from the same school of accounting asCount Cagliostro himself.Jeanne de Saint-Rémy, or de Valois, or de Saint-Rémy de Valois, now also thecomtesse de La Motte, survived and even to a degree mysteriously prospered inthe demimonde of aristocratic social climbers, hangers-on and pretenders, whichwas no small part of the infirm sociology of the Ancien Régime. The slendermeans of many of such people, include Jeanne de Valois, was a small royalpension. The type was actually international. Thackeray, not merely a finenovelist but a fine historian of eighteenth-century England, captured in hisBarry Lyndon and Chevalier of Balibari the most salient features of universaltypes. Jeanne Valois de Saint-Rémy de La Motte managed mainly through herpersistent hunt for supporters for her legal campaign to insert herself amongthe spear-bearers in the gaudy pageant that was the court of Versailles. Shecontinued to be in touch with Cardinal Rohan. As he was persona non grata atVersailles, it was fairly easy for her to convince him of a fictionalfamiliarity she was forming with the queen. It seemed possible that she mighthelp him, even as he had helped her. This was in the early years of the decadeof the 1780s.ii. Cardinal de RohanOne of the leading churchmen of France was the cardinal Louis-René-Edouard,bishop of Strassburg and, quite as important, prince de Rohan-Guéménnée(1734–1803). There was no bluer blood in France than that of the family deRohan, and few men of greater personal wealth than the cardinal. The familymotto was a bold one indeed: Roy ne puis, prince ne daigne, Rohan je suis (“Icannot be a king; I disdain being a prince; I am a Rohan!”). He was not a manentirely without religious principles—he refused to endorse the CivilConstitution of the Clergy at the time of the Revolution, and retired to aGerman exile—but they were sufficiently unobstrusive that no one, for example,would have ever suspected him of Jansenism. His distaste for “fanaticism” wasalmost Anglican, and he exhibited a spirit of toleration which Voltaire himselfmight have applauded. A prince-bishop and an ecclesiastical statesman of a kindknown in all the European countries of the Roman obedience, he was also anotable libertine and a spendthrift.As he behaved so very foolishly in the Affair of the Necklace, it has been tooeasy for some historians to conclude that he was a fool. In point of fact, hewas rather brilliant. Even in a society whose primary laws were grace and favor,it was no easy thing to be elected to the Académie Française at the age oftwenty-seven, or to win among the graybeard immortals the reputation of afascinating conversationalist. Louis de Rohan was a connoisseur of art andliterature. At his great episcopal estate at Saverne, he amassed an importantlibrary. Not all aristocratic bibliophiles actually read their books, but thecardinal did. One of his special interests was the richly decorated medievalliturgical book. The “Rohan” Book of Hours in the Bibliothèque Nationale is oneof the most famous medieval manuscripts in the world, but it was but one of manyin his collection.Above all, so far as our narrative is concerned, cardinal de Rohan participatedin several of the intellectual enthusiasms of the Enlightenment. He interestedhimself in scientific matters. Among the scientific subjects that most engagedthe active mind of Louis de Rohan was alchemy. Like many other aristocrats invarious parts of Europe, he maintained his own laboratory, and given the factthat he had more money than most, it was rather elaborate. We still speak of ourscientists as engaged in “unlocking the secrets of nature,” but the image hasbecome a rather tired cliché. Two hundred and fifty years ago, the idea had areal freshness and a vivacity. Today, the word “occult” immediately invokesmumbo-jumbo. If its literal meaning—hidden, concealed—is in general use at all,it is in an unfortunate medical connection with stool samples. But learned menof that age frequently thought of the “scientific quest” as a kind of greatphilosophical treasure or scavenger hunt prepared in time immemorial by “theGreat Architect of the Universe.” Hence, for many the scientific quest was areligious quest.In the early 1770s, the cardinal was sent as the royal ambassador of Louis XV tothe court of Maria Theresa in Vienna, which the empress’s daughterMarie-Antoinette had recently left to marry the Dauphin of France. He in turnwould very soon become King Louis XVI. In Vienna, the cardinal-ambassador cut avery wide swath. The empress Maria Theresa, whose code of personal morality anddeportment was in comparison with the ambassadorial prelate’s that of aCistercian nun, was soon offended by his worldly ways. Maria Theresa viewed hispopularity with disdain possibly tinged with jealousy. Rather to her disgust hewas a great hit with the young emperor, her son, Joseph II, and he conqueredmost female hearts. “Our women young and old, beautiful and plain, are bewitchedby him,” the empress wrote to her own ambassador in France. “He is their idol.”Probably without fully realizing it, the gossipy, charming cardinal was walkinga fine line, the easiest kind to cross. Soon the diplomat behaved in a way mostundiplomatic by becoming a party to unbecoming gossip concerning the youngAustrian princess soon to be Queen of France. This was an error potentiallyfatal to the ambitions of a most ambitious prelate. He was recalled to Paris indisfavor and—in the eyes of Marie-Antoinette—in a just disgrace. There was avery special bond between the two Maries, mother and daughter, that shinesthrough their abundantly preserved correspondence. The young queen neitherforgave nor forgot the calumnies to which, at least in her own mind, CardinalRohan had subscribed in Vienna. And as the full force of the queen’s power andinfluence became manifest during the early years of the new king’s reign, thecardinal surely realized that any hope for future advancement urgently demandeda rapprochement with her. How, precisely, might that be achieved?Though narratives are sequential, not all events happen in sequence. In the1770s, a great deal was happening in or involving France. Of continuingimportance on the international level was the “rivalry”—often a euphemism forwar, hot or cold—with England. French policy hoped through the support of theAmerican revolutionaries to recoup the losses of the French and Indian War. Allthis, in addition to being largely futile, was very expensive. Meanwhile therewas an endemic and festering fiscal instability, a recurrent agriculturalcrisis, and growing popular discontents. The great historian of the FrenchRevolution, Georges Lefebvre, made the following analogy. The French peasant onthe eve of the Revolution, he wrote, was like a man standing in water up to hislower lip. If all remained calm he could survive, barely, but even the smallestwave meant disaster. The appalling excesses and grinding exactions of highlyvisible aristocrats were not the only cause of popular discontent with themonarchy, but they were a flagrant one. And the apogee of appalling excess wasthe royal court at Versailles, where l’Autricienne (a term of popular contemptroughly equivalent to “the Austrian bitch”) played at being a shepherdess in amagnificently costly monument to Romantic rustic simplicity called the PetitTrianon. It had been built by Louis XV for his “old” mistress, then assigned tohis “new” mistress.Popular hostility to the French royals might have seemed unfair to Louis XVIwho, as compared with his grandfather Louis XV, was a kind of reformer. Hisqueen having died in 1768, Louis XV had spent the last years of his long andgenerally feckless reign quite openly besotted with passion for his newmistress, Madame du Barry (born 1743), who vies in the pages of salacioushistory with his famous old and slightly more discreet mistress, Madame dePompadour (born 1721). In his reforming zeal the new king had banished hispredecessor’s mistress from the court.The defunct king had of course left some loose ends, and one of them was this.Shortly before he died, Louis XV had commissioned from Boehmer & Bassenge,jewelers to the very rich and very famous, a fabulous gift intended for Madamedu Barry: a diamond necklace of unprecedented size and cost—a conservativeconversion would put it at around $100 million in today’s money.That is not a printing error. The real cost of the diamond necklace was aboutone half of the real cost of the Louisiana Purchase two decades later. A royalcommission once made by a king now dead of a gift intended for a mistress nowbanished was nothing like a legal contract, and the jeweler Boehmer faceddisaster, as did, presumably, many others in his chains of supply and finance.His choices were, in effect, a fire sale—breaking up the necklace and gettingwhat he could from the return or recycling of its sparkling parts—or finding anew buyer. Potential buyers were few. Few but kings can pay a king’s ransom. Soafter overcoming difficulties of diplomacy and protocol, he offered the gems tothe new queen, Marie-Antoinette.Marie-Antoinette has not had what you could call a good press, though it isbetter today than in the graffiti and subversive libels of the early 1780s, letalone than at the time of her manifestly unjust revolutionary trial. Mark it tothe credit side of her ledger, therefore, that she just said no. She never said,“Let them eat cake” to the French peasantry, but she did say no to the jewelerBoehmer. In fact she had done so, repeatedly, over the period of about a decade.The end result could hardly have been worse if she had said yes, however, as thebasic elements for the Sting were now in place.These matters were soon publicized in the manner so much private court businesswas, in the buzz of drawing-room gossip in which truth and fiction werepromiscuously mingled to the detriment of each. It was reported that the queenhad demurred reluctantly and under the coercion of the spoilsport numbercrunchers, and that her heart continued to long for the gems. Boehmer persuadedhimself that the queen’s apparently final answer was actually temporary orprovisional, that hope was still alive. These are the circumstances in whichJeanne de La Motte of the Valois found opportunity and seized it.The foundation of the confidence scheme was Cardinal Rohan’s keen desire toregain the queen’s favor, which was far from a secret in court circles. Thoughwe can never know the precise details nor trace in its full complexity thespiderweb of personal relations among all the people involved, Jeanne de LaMotte devised a daring and ingenious way to harness the cardinal’s wishfulthinking. The plan was this. The cardinal must be convinced that the queen’swrath toward him was already much softened and that it might be dissolvedentirely, indeed turned to favor, if he would help her achieve her publiclysuppressed desire to possess the necklace. The means of doing this would involvea secret, short-term line of credit to the queen. The whole difficulty inclinching a deal with Boehmer was simply a temporary cash flow problem at thePetit Trianon. It would be obviated if Rohan would counter-sign a noteguaranteeing payment to Boehmer on a quarterly basis, with the first paymentfalling due by the Feast of the Assumption, August 15. (It is of latersignificance, incidentally, that the Feast of the Assumption was the one day ofthe year that Cardinal Rohan had to be tolerated at Versailles. By ancientcustom the Grand Almoner of France was required to celebrate mass in the royalchapel on that day.) In other words the cardinal would with utmost discretionmortgage the better part of his fortune to the jeweler Boehmer, take possessionof the necklace, and transport it clandestinely to the queen through the trustedcourier, their mutual friend, Jeanne de Valois. The queen would quietly pay offthe jeweler according to the agreed-upon contract. For a cost no greater thanthe effort of signing a piece of paper, Rohan would have purchased the queen’sundying friendship. But this plan would develop only organically, in increments,as one step follows upon another.Jeanne de La Motte persuaded the cardinal to begin a correspondence with thequeen for which she, Jeanne, would be the “backchannel” courier. Cardinal Rohanwrote real letters to the queen, who of course never saw them; Jeanne and herconfederates wrote forged but convincing answers on purloined or counterfeitedroyal stationery. Rohan amid eloquent expressions of personal esteem andpolitical loyalty petitioned for forgiveness. The supposed letters of the queenoffered tantalizing hope that it might be forthcoming. Jeanne de La Motte atevery stage stressed to the cardinal the delicacy of the matter and itspotential to explode should the slightest glimmer of light penetrate the curtainof secrecy thrown over it.An obvious feature of life under the Old Regime was that the titled feltentitled. Less obvious, perhaps, is that it was often true that the wobblier thetitle, the firmer the sense of entitlement. Jeanne believed that she deserved aplace at court, and the will to power proved to be power itself. She prosperedin the cardinal’s favor. He personally supplemented her small pension, as helavished small charity on dozens of others. Trowbridge wrote of Rohan that “Hepossessed all the conspicuous qualities and defects which in the eighteenthcentury were characteristic of the aristocrat.” History has amply recorded thedefects. Among the conspicuous qualities was an open-hearted and open-handedgenerosity, especially to those he thought worthy. Jeanne may have alsoembezzled one fairly large grant from the Almonry. She was able to pay back,with a certain ostentation, numerous shopkeepers’ accounts and small loans shehad borrowed from various Versailles acquaintances. The effect was classic. Thecredit rating of the would-be Valois heiress was dramatically upgraded.Dressmakers practically queued up to gain her custom on tick. People began tobelieve that she actually was a special intimate of the queen’s. She became herown one-woman credit bubble.Jeanne de La Motte continued to bring reassuring news from the queen. Rohan was,Jeanne assured him, regaining her royal favor. He was eager to believe—Credereaude, indeed—but unfortunately, there was absolutely no public hint that theoptimistic reports were true. Cognitive dissonance induced in him a spasm ofprudence rather than frank suspicion. He mulled things over. A genuine feelingof friendship surely merited some empirical demonstration, however slight? Thecardinal longed for a personal audience with Marie-Antoinette, however public orperfunctory. To Jeanne de La Motte he confided his true position. He realizedand honored the necessity for strict confidentiality; but he could not be askedto continue his incrementally expensive campaign without first having theopportunity to express his devotion to the queen herself, in person.As we know from the histories of our own Ponzi schemes, the initial success offraud often simply raises the stakes for the defrauder both in terms ofpotential gain and of danger of exposure. Jeanne de La Motte, a former cowherd,had successfully hoodwinked the Grand Almoner of France and an academician intobelieving a fine cock-and-bull story, but something more was needed. Thecardinal was hooked, but he might yet easily struggle free. The payoff woulddemand yet more daring and more danger to herself. It was at this point that the“Affair of the Necklace” took the quite literally dramatic turn for which it hasmerited a hundred retellings.Fabricated letters from the queen had brought the conspirators very near theirgoal, but to reach it would require something yet more audacious: a fabricatedqueen! It is not clear how far ahead the far-seeing Jeanne de La Motte hadanticipated the chess game she had orchestrated, but her flair for improvisationwas as striking as her strategic genius. She faced the formidable challenges offinding an actress to impersonate Marie-Antoinette, and creating the stageconditions in which the actress might impersonate the queen convincingly to aman who was quite familiar with the real thing. She was able to come up withboth.Idling about the Palais Royale one day, the comte La Motte, the willing tool ofhis more able and imaginative wife, came across a woman who bore a strikingresemblance to Queen Marie-Antoinette. She may have in fact profited from thatresemblance, for she was a sometime actress from the demimonde of Parisianstreet carnivals and puppet shows. Her name was Nicole d’Oliva, alias MmeLeguay. She is usually called a prostitute, probably unfairly. The conspiratorsenlisted Nicole for the starring role of Marie-Antoinette in one brief scene oftheir devising.Jeanne de La Motte told the cardinal that the queen would agree to a meetingunder the condition that it would be brief and absolutely private; more thanprivate—it must be conducted in absolute secrecy. The venue proposed was asecluded alley of the Park of Versailles known as “the Grove of Venus.” The timewould be the dark of night. He must wear a disguise: that of a musketeer. Thisprobably sounded more plausible to the cardinal than it does to the modernreader. From the point of view of normal mortals, a confusion of the real andthe fantastic was a fundamental aspect of the court at Versailles; the wholeoperation was, on a permanent basis, at least half theme park. The gardens ofVersailles were not a public amusement park, but they were so frequently thesite of various kinds of make-believe, plays, pageants, concerts, amorouspromenades, Fragonard-style tableaux, and other high jinks among the high-upsthat almost nothing in that line would have alarmed the guardians.The arranged meeting took place—one is tempted to say the caper went down—on thenight of August 11, 1784. It followed the scenario of the classic snipe hunt.The cardinal in mufti, guided by Jeanne amid hushes and shushes, came to theGrove of Venus. Jeanne then stepped into the blackness behind a bush. Presentlya heavily veiled female, very like a queen, emerged from another part of thearboreal darkness, holding something in one hand. This may have been Nicoled’Oliva’s greatest and best remunerated role, but it was also one of her moresilent ones. The two disguised figures approached each other in the gloom, andthe cardinal knelt before his sovereign and kissed her proffered hand. Beforemuch more could happen, the comtesse de La Motte reappeared in simulated alarm,as though the scene was about to be discovered by the Night Watch. She hurriedthe cardinal off in one direction while the veiled lady quickly retreated inanother. Before doing so, however, she had dropped before her genuflectingpetitioner the object she had been carrying: a single long-stemmed red rose.IN HIS LATER LEGAL TESTIMONY the humiliated Rohan was forced to admit that themeeting in the Grove of Venus had not merely convinced him that he had had aninterview with the queen, but had “blinded” him to all the increasingly boldmachinations of Jeanne de Valois. In the winter of 1784–85 she summoned thecardinal to Paris (he was in Strassburg at the time), which he reached only withdifficulty on account of a snowstorm. She had important news for him from thequeen, who needed a big favor. She then for the first time raised the matter ofguaranteeing the loan for the necklace, a sum enormous even for Bourbons orRohans.Cardinal Rohan counter-signed the bill from the jewelers, little realizing thatthere was no royal signature to counter. Boehmer gave him the jewels. Thecardinal gave them to the Valois pretender to deliver to the queen, and theywere never seen again—except by the fences and their unscrupulous or unwaryclients. The scam, though fantastically successful, was of course a time bombfor the conspirators. Jeanne de La Motte acted with such apparent recklessnessbecause she felt confident that the cardinal, when the truth was finally forcedupon him, would choose to be a pauper rather than the universal laughingstock ofFrance.This theory, at best highly dubious, was never tested. As the time for the firstpayment neared, the nervousness of the jeweler Boehmer intervened. Jeanne hadcounted on his going to the cardinal for explanation. He went to the royalcouple themselves. Marie-Antoinette knew nothing of any contract, and certainlyshe had received no necklace. Boehmer took the document to the king. Here was agrotesque, palpable fraud. In the queen’s immediate but errant judgment itsauthor must be Cardinal Rohan, and its purpose her humiliation. She alreadydespised the man, and her dim view was largely shared by Breteuil, the royalhousehold minister. Now she wanted to destroy him.The Affair of the Diamond Necklace was grand larceny on the grand scale. Thequeen’s fatal misperception was that it was a personal insult different indegree rather than in kind from the scabrous calumnies daily served up by thecoffeehouse gossips and the gutter press. The essential facts in the case wereeasily enough discovered even in a preliminary criminal investigation. TheValois woman was a magnificent adventuress. In his desire to ingratiate himselfwith the queen, Rohan had made himself the laughingstock of a large nation. YetMarie-Antoinette remained captive to her idée fixe that the cardinal was avillain rather than a fool, and that his motive had been to inflict harm andpublic humiliation upon her. Her insistence on seeking public vindicationthrough a “public” prosecution of Rohan before the Parliament of Paris was astupendous blunder that achieved precisely the grievous damage to her reputationshe sought to erase. Breteuil seems also to have misjudged the situation, andthe king, rarely a competent political strategist, fell in with the queen’sdesire.When you see the words “Parliament of Paris,” do not think of Westminster, letalone the National Convention of the Revolution. The Parliament of Paris was nota popular or representative legislative body, but principally a court of law. Itwas the most important of numerous regional parlements, vestiges of a medievalinstitution that in the fourteenth century had been a kind of royal advisorycabinet. It was now a legal consistory that might be called France’s SupremeCourt, in that it did hear appeals of cases from various parts of thecomplicated judicial system of the Ancien Régime. In some instances, includingthe criminal trials of peers of the realm like Cardinal Rohan, it was the courtof “first instance.” It was full of able, ambitious, and sometimes intriguinglawyers, not all of whom were admirers of the queen. In theory, it remained anorgan of royal power. In actuality, it aspired to an acknowledged legislativerole. The queen was counting on the prestige and dignity of the Parlement toclear her name by condemning Rohan. Instead, it conducted an independent andreasonably fair trial and acquitted him. It likewise acquitted Count Cagliostro.For the duration of the trial, which lasted nine months, the defendants wereincarcerated in the Bastille. For Cagliostro, the imprisonment was an ordealthat left him shaken if not broken. And like so many other things about the man,it has left its ambiguous traces on his historical reception. There were manyhouses of detention in Paris, but among them the Bastille was unique. Its iconicsignificance to the republican consciousness is indicated by the fact that it isBastille Day (July 14) that has been chosen as the national patriotic holiday.Americans chose to commemorate a document, Frenchmen a sanguinary assault on acomplex of buildings that had long since become a generally detested emblem ofarbitrary power.II. A Prisoner of Conscience?We naturally think of a prison as a place of incarceration for convictedcriminals doomed to a specific term. This concept, however, was not a part ofthe justice system of the Ancien Régime. The Bastille was in effect a very largeholding pen. Its miscellaneous population might include at any time peoplearrested “at the King’s pleasure,” for whom no trial was actually envisioned,arrested suspects awaiting or undergoing trial, and convicted criminals housedfor a short period following conviction as they awaited actualpunishment—usually some more or less ghastly corporal chastisement ranging fromwhipping through branding with a hot iron to hanging and dismemberment. (Afterher conviction, Jeanne de La Motte was whipped and branded with a hot iron withthe sign of the thief.)The Bastille was in many respects quite like the Tower of London or the CastelSant’ Angelo in Rome, the inquisitorial prison where Cagliostro was fated tosuffer. Such buildings had been raised as fortifications rather thanpenitentiaries, and the peculiarities of their architecture reflected themilitary motive of keeping people out rather than keeping them in. Theadministrative name of the prison was the Royal Castle of the Bastille. The mostprominent architectural subdivision of each wing of the complex was the discreettower, or keep, the original meaning of the word bastille. In the Bastille,seven of the eight towers were given over to prisoners. From the prisoners’perspective the effect was that of a group of contiguous but separate apartmentbuildings.The Bastille itself was odious in the copious underground literature ofsubversive tendency that made up such an important part of the capital’sjournalism. Odious too was the means by which so many unfortunates found theirway within its walls. This was the infamous lettre de cachet (literally a lettermarked with the official seal), one of the principal instruments of Bourbontyranny. A letter bearing the king’s signature, counter-signed by one of hisministers, was a sufficient warrant for the immediate arrest and indefinitedetention, without trial and without appeal, of anyone the king wanted to getrid of. Gross abuse could compound the gross injustice, since not all monarchsin need of revenues were chary of actually selling such letters to people whowanted to rid themselves of enemies or inconvenient rivals. Real criminals anddesperate characters were often held in the Bastille, but so foul was theinstitution’s reputation as an emblem of the abusive exercise of arbitrary powerthat detention there could as easily be taken for a badge of honor as one ofinfamy. After his eventual liberation and removal to London, Cagliostro ablyexploited his incipient reputation as a martyr of Enlightenment. He was, afterall, quite innocent of any involvement in the criminal conspiracy.We have good resources for recapturing a sense of “daily life in the Bastille.”Rather amazingly, a vast archive of documentary materials has survived, whichwas gathered together and carefully edited in the nineteenth century. There isalso a substantial literature of political propaganda consisting of more or lessauthentic prison memoirs. Prisoners at the Bastille were required to take anoath that, upon release, they would reveal nothing of their experiences withinthe forbidding walls. It would be hard to imagine a more effective goad toauthorship.Prison life can hardly be pleasant under the best of circumstances; yet for themost part the accommodations for prisoners in the Bastille were seldom like themedieval dungeon of popular iconography. Circumstances varied considerably, butfor those who could accommodate the system of “pay to stay,” things were notintolerable. A fair number of prisoners actually lived the life of paying guestsor medieval royal hostages. Cardinal de Rohan, for example, despite being theobject of continual royal displeasure, didn’t have too bad a time. He wasbuffered by his own resources, which allowed him to cater his own food whendesired. On one occasion he gave a dinner party for twenty of his friends.Many of the memoirs complain of oppressive conditions, poor food, and unhealthysanitary arrangements, as well as of high-handed and despotic actions on thepart of the prison governor (warden) or of turnkeys. There was no routineapplication of torture, though shackles and restraints were used in manyeighteenth-century prisons with a frequency we would find unnecessary and cruel.Nonetheless, like many others Cagliostro was grievously abused, even if historments were largely psychological.His situation was in fact very grave. His primary association with the plot camefrom his close friendship with Cardinal Rohan, who remained throughout thespecial object of Marie-Antoinette’s fury. Even without the grosser forms oftorture, his treatment during his confinement was both harsh and cruel. Thoughhe potentially faced drastic punishment—indeed, capital punishment if foundguilty of lèse-majesté—his greatest concern was for his wife Serafina. In factshe herself had been thrown into one of the towers of the Bastille shortly afterCagliostro’s own imprisonment. But the prison authorities repeatedly lied to himabout this and other matters of deep concern to him. Many of the deceptive orcoercive interrogation techniques that reached their point of refinement in thepolice states of the twentieth century were already in use, and they were usedon the hapless count. His incoming mail was intercepted and often confiscated.His outgoing letters often got no further than the turnkey’s hands. He had noaccess to the press.This last restriction was particularly severe. Rohan and Jeanne de La Motte werethe principal defendants, and Cagliostro was actually exposed to the court onlysparingly, too sparingly to see the larger shape of things. The trial excitedenormous interest in Paris, and although it was by no means “public” in themodern sense, it might as well have been. Leakers and spin doctors kept up asteady flow of information, a good deal of it surprisingly accurate; and thepress dwelt with loving detail on all of it. Had Cagliostro been able to seesome of these materials, he surely would have grasped that it was the queenrather than the cardinal who was in the greater trouble.THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS a political dimension to history—by which I mean to thewriting and interpretation of history—so that the historiography of the Affairof the Necklace has remained to a degree controversial on political grounds.Funck-Brentano’s book, mentioned earlier, was attacked almost immediately bothon the grounds that it was unoriginal (if not plagiarized) and that it waspolitically reactionary. According to one way of thinking, to exculpate bothMarie-Antoinette and the cardinal, as Funck-Brentano had done, was in a certainsense to exculpate the Ancien Régime at the expense of the incipientrevolutionary spirit. Nonetheless, after a century or more of study and analysisit remains most probable that the queen had known nothing about any effort tosecure the gems on her behalf, and that Cardinal Rohan’s humiliating testimonybefore the tribunal was true in its essential points. Jeanne de La Motte Valoiswas flagrantly guilty of fraud, and her husband nearly as much so. Thetheatrical strumpet Nicole d’Oliva probably didn’t know all the details of theplot, but she certainly knew it was a scam.What about Count Cagliostro? Jeanne de La Motte was vehement in her accusationthat he was a conspirator, and that has often been the judgment of history aswell. Like Rohan he was acquitted by the judges of the Parlement, and histreatment would win for him among political liberals the reputation of a victimof tyranny. In fact, however, his reputation “in society” was now ruined beyondrepair. There can be no doubt that it was his association with the Affair of theNecklace that marked the beginning of his sharp decline.Yet common sense argues for his innocence. He was simply in the right place atthe wrong time. For the right place for Cagliostro was ever in the corridors ofthe wealthy and the influential, in the salons of interesting people, amid thevotaries of esotericism around the fringes of the Enlightenment and sometimescloser to its core.It is not, however, an open-and-shut case. Since the time of the RussianRevolution and the emergence of a “science” of revolution such as thatattributed to Lenin, the idea has from time to time been advanced thatCagliostro might have been a covert agent of the Illuminati or some other Germansecret society. According to this theory, he seized the opportunity to involvehimself in an agitation that helped speed the advent of the Revolution. Manyhistorians have been tempted to see in these highly public events of 1784–85 akind of prelude to the more violent events of 1789. That would, of course, haverequired a clairvoyance beyond the common or garden kind that Cagliostronormally practiced.The more material motive of the plot had always been money, money to be squeezedfrom cardinal de Rohan. A plausible conspiratorial role for Cagliostro wouldhave been the exercise of his influence in encouraging Rohan to take the bait.Since it is pretty clear that Jeanne was trying to join the high aristocracyrather than destroy it, the only thing she could have offered the wizard was apart of the swag. But he already had a part of the swag. He was the cardinal’sfriend, and nothing in the demonstrated character of either man leads us tothink it was other than a frank and generous friendship. They were fellow men ofscience. The cardinal’s sumptuous lodgings—both at Saverne in Alsace and (quiteas important for Cagliostro) in the magnificent hôtel de Rohan in the rueVieille du Temple in Paris, were open to Cagliostro with their libraries, theirlaboratories, and perhaps above all with their contacts.There is furthermore Cagliostro’s explicit testimony to the court. He counteredJeanne de La Motte’s charges of collusion by saying that he had suspected herall along, and that he had on several occasions warned the cardinal that she wasan adventuress. The cardinal did not accuse Cagliostro, and seems at leastindirectly to have confirmed his testimony when he confessed that after acertain point he had become entirely “blinded” to Jeanne’s operations.Cagliostro had conspicuous faults, perhaps, but the lust for money and the lustfor women were not among them. In these matters he has to be judged against the“control group” of socially obsessed international aristocracy among whom hemoved. He struggled, at times desperately, to maintain an appropriate externalmanifestation of his station. But he never took a fee for his medical work,beyond actual reimbursement, in a situation in which he could have made a smallfortune. And unlike the cardinal, whose sex life does not seem to have been tooseverely constrained by any inconvenience of his votive chastity, Cagliostro wasa happily married man and a loving husband. One of the most poignant aspects ofhis long incarceration in the Bastille was the obvious sincerity of his deepconcern for the unknown fate of Serafina.III. The Return to LondonLondon was not the only destination of those summarily expelled from Francebeneath royal displeasure, but it might be said to have been the destination ofchoice. It was to London that the exiled Cagliostro almost inevitably returned.There was a very large French population in the English capital, includingnumerous distinguished descendants of the Huguenot diaspora. There were likewiseother martyrs to liberty. Of course there were also, inevitably, numerouscriminals on the lam. Jeanne de La Motte upon escaping from the prison of theSalpêtrière in 1787 fled there with her branded bosom, as her disreputablehusband had fled earlier with a bag full of loose diamonds. As a result, formore or less good reasons, even before the Revolutionary emigration London wascrawling with French police agents, informers, spies, agents provocateurs,bounty hunters, and adventurers. Cagliostro’s London retreat was greatlytroubled by one of these shadowy figures, the fascinating and repellent CharlesThéveneau de Morande.Théveneau de Morande was a man of parts, and we must return to himpresently—after considering, briefly, the important arena in which the two mencontested. That was the court of public opinion, in which most of the pleading,whether for the prosecution or for the defense, was conducted in the publicpress.The historian Robert Darnton, perhaps the world’s leading authority on broadercultural implications of the print culture of the Enlightenment period, haswritten with equal grace and erudition about a kind of literary demimonde inwhich gossip, slander, satire, subversion, and pornography vied with one anotherin transgression for the favors of an eager public. Of course it was morepleasant to read about others’ iniquities than about one’s own. We have seenthat people could and did write “libels” for the sole purpose of extorting moneyfrom victims able to pay not to have them published. But they also wrotesalacious books that commanded large, often international audiences. Some of themore famous French pornographers of the period, such as the marquis de Sade(1740–1814) and Nicolas-Edme Rétif (1734–1806), are read today in elegant andlearnedly annotated editions, practically oozing with redeeming social value.In London, the vile Théveneau de Morande was probably the king of the yellowjournalists. Morande has recently been the subject of a rich and beautifullywritten biography by the historian Simon Burrows: A King’s Ransom: The Life ofCharles Théveneau de Morande, Blackmailer, Scandalmonger, and Master-Spy (NewYork, 2010). This fine book, while resting upon deeply researched scholarship,is attractively accessible to a general reader, and I have profited byconsulting it. I do have one small qualification. Burrows treats Cagliostro in aconventional and monochromatic Carlylian way simply as “the greatest charlatanof the eighteenth century.” In 1771, writing anonymously of course, Morande madea very famous contribution to the literature of scandal: the Gazetier cuirassé(The Armor-Plated Gazetteer, or Scandalous Anecdotes of the Court of France).This publication, writes Burrows, was the man’s “masterpiece. It offered a headymixture of pithy invective, informational soundbites and political satire,together with scurrilous gossip, innuendo and sexual defamation. It wasinstantly recognized as a uniquely scandalous, toxic and dangerous pamphlet, andfor many years its very title was a term of opprobrium.” It was full of insult,defamation, blasphemy, and depravity. It was of course also seriously illegal.It sold for a guinea, and it made a bundle.Théveneau de Morande was the master of many arts, most of them dark, and throughthe practice of one of them, journalism, he has had a decisive influence on thecreation of the Cagliostro legend. For a good deal of what the world has knownabout Cagliostro, or thought it has known, derives from some articles publishedin Morande’s paper, the Courier de l’Europe.The Courier de l’Europe was one of several French-language journals published inLondon, where, as also in the larger cities of the Netherlands, there was asignificant population of French-speaking compositors, inkers, printers,binders, and other artisans of the publishing trade. It identified itself as“Anglo-French” in focus. Though the Courier was something of a specializedjournal—its specialties being gutter gossip and scandalmongering—it stillrepresented an important Enlightenment phenomenon, that of organizedinternational communication. Enlightenment thinkers sought to eschew the localand the parochial in favor of the universal and the international. The lovelyphrase “the Republic of Letters” denoted no earthly nation but rather aspiritual concept beyond geography. In the vast circulatory system of theRepublic of Letters there were a thousand conduits of information exchange, someprivate, some public.It is a well-known fact that the so-called Correspondence Societies were amongthe most efficient conduits for the exchange of ideas and the transmission ofnew information; they played an important role in the development of politicaland indeed revolutionary ideas throughout the eighteenth century. In manyinstances they were associated in one way or another with Masonic lodges. Mostof the national academies of the Enlightenment had a distinctly internationalflavor. To this very day—a day of multiple means of electroniccommunication—learned societies often have their sections of “CorrespondingFellows” in foreign parts. Remember, this was a world in which practicallynobody who was anybody spent less than two hours a day conducting privatecorrespondence, and some expended considerably more.The Enlightenment witnessed also the rise of the modern periodical. EveryEuropean capital saw the appearance of more or less “learned” journals, some ofwhich were intentionally designed to popularize specialized knowledge forburgeoning popular audiences. Among the most famous such journals was theGentleman’s Magazine, founded in London in the 1730s. This publication appearsto have introduced the modern meaning of “magazine” into the English language.Before that, the word meant a warehouse or storehouse, particularly a repositoryfor arms and munitions. Magazines now became storehouses of facts, ideas, andmiscellaneous information, periodic and incremental additions to theEncyclopédie.It would be a mistake, however, to imagine that the international press wasuniversally high-minded. Gutenberg is today associated with the printing of anextremely expensive book in Latin; but nearly since the invention of modernprinting in the mid-fifteenth century there had always been a “popular” press,specializing in relatively cheap goods such as religious emblems, prayers, andsecular broadsheets. The market for such items only increased during the periodthat the incremental learning of Europe was flooding Enlightenment Europe in itsfat quartos and octavos. Often these cheap goods were sold by hawkers in thestreet—a social fact remembered in the English word “chapbook.” Many ballads,broadsheets, and chapbooks were in fact modern “news” of a kind. The Westernepic tradition is founded in the poetic memorialization of great deeds. Many ofthe Border ballads from the medieval twilight began with actual historicalpersonages and events.Eighteenth-century journalism continued these traditions and expanded themgreatly. The genres of the newspaper and the novel (the nouvelles of coursebeing “news”) not unsurprisingly develop together. The personality columns andsuggestive centerfolds of the contemporary popular press carry on, in attenuatedform, two great traditions of the Enlightenment: gossip and pornography.One favorite genre of the eighteenth-century novel is epistolary—that is,composed of an imagined exchange of letters. Very famous early English andFrench examples would include Richardson’s Pamela and Clarissa and Les liaisonsdangereuses of Choderlos de Laclos. In a later chapter we shall have occasion toreview a once famous epistolary novel, the Valérie of Julie de Krüdener. It isnot surprising, therefore, that one of the most popular genres of popularjournalism was likewise the letter, actual or fictive.In the wake of the Affair of the Necklace, Cagliostro was attacked in a numberof such letters. One of them, allegedly referring to events of the year 1780 butpublished only in 1786, was entitled Cagliostro demasqué à Varsovie, ou,Relation authentique de ses Opérations alchimiques et magiques faites dans cettecapital en 1780 (Cagliostro Unmasked in Warsaw, or, a True Account of HisAlchemical and Magical Operations Undertaken in that Capital City in 1780). Thedemasker was himself of course masked. Authorship is attributed only to “aneyewitness.” The eyewitness states his high-minded goal of public service in anintroductory “Avis” to his readers. “This true account,” he writes, “will serveto fill a large lacuna in the history of the swindles of Cagliostro.…” Actually,the Warsaw demasker is rather generic in his abuse. According to his pamphletCagliostro, having earlier abused the Masons in Courland (the Baltic) and inRussia, next abused the Masons of Warsaw with his pretended “Egyptian rite” andhis materializations of the Grand Copht.The “letter” of the eyewitness engages another frequent convention of theepistolary novel in making direct quotations from other eyewitnesses, andespecially from the contemporary journal of “M. M***.” According to this truerelation within a true relation, Cagliostro held a séance on June 10, 1780, atwhich the Grand Copht, “several thousand years old,” appeared. “He was quitefat, dressed in white, with white locks, with a turban on his head”—that is,Cagliostro himself in Pharaonic drag. As the scene became ludicrous as well asunconvincing, the Copht hastily extinguished the candles. When the lights wererekindled, after a certain amount of thumping and bumping, the Copht was gone,replaced by Cagliostro himself. Cagliostro demasqué ends with a flourish ofPolish patriotism. “Thus Poland has the glory of having exposed this somiraculous fellow, who had created such a sensation as to have gained greatrespect at Petersburg and at Mitau, and who finally came to have the whole worldbelieving that he was a prodigy of science.”Cagliostro demasqué reveals a common feature of the negative contemporaryassessments on which the Carlylian assessment would be based. While it accusedthe magus of incompetence, it makes no sustained charge of venality. In hisalchemical operations he appears to have claimed on more than one occasion thathe had created diamonds in the crucible. The principal aim of most confidenceschemes is material gain—usually the gain of money itself, sometimes the gain ofvaluable property that can be exchanged for money. If Cagliostro was aconfidence swindler, he was a singularly unsuccessful one, as there is nodocumented instance in which he profited financially from his transactions,including the sale of his medicinal “packets.” On several occasions, on theother hand, the man was himself the victim of swindlers. We recall that hisfirst visit to London was one long swindle which, he claimed, had cost him theenormous sum of 3,000 guineas.WE HAVE ALREADY NOTED that there is much social history in the sad etymologicaldevelopment of the word “libel.” In Latin the generic word for book was liber,and its diminutive form was libellus—“a little book” or pamphlet. The vernacularform “libel” originally meant any one of a variety of brief written statementsof a public character, such as the written form of a legal claim or charge. Butalready by the seventeenth century it had acquired the special characteristic itretains to this day: a scurrilous or defamatory attack in written form, theverbal equivalent of which was slander. In the eighteenth century the word“libel” would have brought to mind a popular literary genre rather than acategory of legal tort.I write in the wake of a scandal in popular British journalism that led to thedemise of the nation’s most venerable yellow sheet, the News of the World.Journalists for the News of the World were discovered to have hacked into thetelephones of newsworthy persons on the trail of private information. Onesensationally tasteless invasion of privacy involved the hacking of the cellphone of a young girl who had been murdered. The hackers actually erased some ofthe messages in the dead girl’s mailbox in order to make room for new messageswhich the journalists might be able to ransack. Yet as grotesque as all this is,it hardly approaches the excesses of eighteenth-century journalism. The News ofthe World hackers were at least on a quest for actual information. Theireighteenth-century predecessors would not scruple at simply making up storiesout of whole cloth.Sometimes such stories were whimsical in character and satirical in motive.Swift, in the Bickerstaff Papers, attacked the astrologer Partridge in thefollowing ingenious way. He first issued a prediction that Partridge would dieon a certain day, and then, when the day arrived, he published an announcementthat he had in fact died. Poor Partridge was left in the ridiculous position ofhaving to maintain the claim of his continuing existence against theoverwhelming evidence of the journalistic report! Satire depends upon a tacitcollusion between author and reader. It is in the nature of satire to try toconvince a reader that the exaggerations or even pure inventions heaped upon thevictim by the author are excusable in light of the victim’s villainy, stupidity,or dullness. But very often the personal attack was simply scurrilous.Lord George Gordon was one of the more remarkable characters in an age in which“characters” were scattered quite thickly over the British soil. He was a minormember of the Scottish hereditary nobility who as a quite young man, just beforethe American Revolution, was returned as the member of Parliament for Lugershallin Wiltshire—one of the “rotten” boroughs that were eventually abolished at thetime of the Reform Act. Gordon was a man of notable eccentricities, the mostvivid of which, in the eyes of his British contemporaries, was his conversion toOrthodox Judaism. As this stage of his career just postdated his commerce withCount Cagliostro, it need not concern us except, perhaps, as an index of hiscapacity to follow his convictions with radical courage.His most famous historical association is that with the so-called “No Popery”Riots in London in June 1780. This series of violent mob actions, written aboutso grippingly by Dickens in his novel Barnaby Rudge, are indeed usually calledthe Lord Gordon Riots. They came about in the following way. The Roman Catholicpopulation of the United Kingdom, a minority not negligible in their numbers,and significantly augmented by emigration from Ireland and the Continent, hadsuffered under onerous restrictions since the time of the Glorious Revolution atthe end of the seventeenth century. Full “Catholic emancipation” would not comeuntil the nineteenth century. But in 1778 the government introduced a bill torelieve Catholics of certain disabilities, the most important of which (from thegovernment’s point of view) was the necessity of swearing a Protestant oath tojoin the army. The motive for abolition was less Enlightenment tolerance thanthe recognition of military necessity. England was fighting wars on multiplefronts, including, conspicuously, the American front.Like several other aspects of British statute law, this one had tolerantlysubsided into legal fiction. The religious test for military service, though notquite a dead letter, had by no means been rigorously enforced in the second halfof the eighteenth century. Some prominent Catholics regarded Englishanti-Catholicism as a sleeping dog best left undisturbed. They actually opposedthe proposed legislation on the grounds that its potential for mischief wasgreater than its promise of practical amelioration. Their concerns wereprescient.Anti-Catholic agitators of various stripes and motives opposed the bill. LordGordon led successful opposition to a similar initiative for Scotland, and nowan English group called the Protestant Association, of which Lord George Gordonwas the president and parliamentary spokesman, organized a petition, to whichwas appended a huge scroll of signatures, to present to the Parliament inWestminster. Gordon marched to Parliament Square at the head of a large (perhaps50,000) and, for a time reasonably orderly, crowd. But after he had entered thebuilding, serious “disturbances” broke out amid shouts of “No Popery”—whichwould become the battle cry of the urban warriors.Within a few days the army suppressed the rioters with considerable loss oflife. However, they had by then terrorized the Irish Catholics in Moorfields anddestroyed or damaged Catholic churches, including the private chapels of someContinental diplomats. They had torched a major distillery—one of the grimmestscenes in Barnaby Rudge, which presents the event as an alcoholic firestorm in adouble sense—whose owner was a Catholic. But they also, and more importantly,attacked the prisons. They liberated the prisoners in Newgate and in the Clink.Mobs attacked the Bank of England. They destroyed the private residence of LordMansfield, Lord High Justice, and prosecuted many other acts of violence moreobviously attributable to political than to religious motive.Few historical actions, including pitched military battle, are less reliablyobservable or confidently explained than mob actions. That is true even today, agolden age of photography, closed circuit televisions, and satellitesurveillance. In the introduction to his classic study The Crowd in the FrenchRevolution, the historian George Rudé points out that the interpretation of theFrench “mob,” which obviously played a crucial role at cardinal moments of theRevolution, such as the storming of the Bastille, has been largely a function ofthe historians’ political points of view. Such also is true of the Gordon Riots,which need to be appreciated within the larger revolutionary context. A flurryof quick trials followed the government’s restoration of order, and several ofthe ringleaders were hanged. But of course ringleadership (like kingpinship) isoften in the eye of the beholding magistrature. Lord George Gordon was indictedand tried, with his life in the balance. His trial was a major public event, andhis acquittal, which he owed largely to the brilliance of his lawyer, Erskine,was a large defeat for the government.The outcome, however, was regarded in enlightened circles not as an endorsementof religious bigotry but as a triumph for political liberty. In this respect itis important to grasp that the virulent anti-Catholicism of the “No Popery”movement veiled republican sentiments, or at least a strong criticism ofabsolute monarchy. Gordon emerged from all this as a hero of the “liberals,”just as John Wilkes, who had led troops attacking the rioters at the Bank ofEngland, emerged as one of their apostates.IN ACCOUNTING FOR THÉVENEAU’S persecution of Cagliostro, Burrows is inclined tofind an explanation in the wizard’s bad company. Cagliostro collaborated withthe “radical” lawyers Thilorier and Duval d’Eprésmésnil in propagandizingagainst the Bourbon tyranny, and he kept company with Lord George Gordon.The political dimension of British anti-Catholicism was made more obvious in theScottish debates that anticipated the London riots of 1780. There was a sizableold Catholic population in Scotland, and Catholicism was the religion of theStuart pretender. The family’s ancient religion—not to mention the fact thatJames Stuart’s brother Henry was a priest who actually rose to become acardinal—was a terrible impediment to the Jacobite cause. Still, James’sproponents looked to British Catholics for military support, and also to thehelp of an invasion force from Catholic France. In the famous (and for theJacobites) disastrous Forty-Five—the unsuccessful Jacobite rising in theHighlands named for the year of its occurrence, 1745—the French troop shipsnever arrived, having been scattered by bad weather. Just how serious thepotential French intervention had been is a matter of contention among thehistorians. But Anglican preachers, and their even more ferociouslyanti-Catholic Scots Presbyterian brethren, retrospectively saw in the episodethe hand of Providence and a reprise of the defeat of the Armada in 1588. LordGordon’s opposition to the Catholic Relief bill being considered in Scotland hadbeen founded in his equation of Catholicism with Bourbon absolutism. In thisrespect, anti-Catholicism was a gesture of political liberalism and a presage ofthe political radicalism of the 1790s. It was thus in a “progressive” spiritualalliance that Cagliostro joined with Gordon and, indeed, with most of the majorfigures of the Enlightenment. It was Voltaire who came up with the battle cryEcrasez l’infâme, which in England in 1780 found a literal and sanguinaryexpression.But Gordon was both a fanatic and a genuine eccentric—as his amazing subsequentconversion to Orthodox Judaism was to prove. It is almost always dangerous tobefriend fanaticism, and it can be very inconvenient to befriend eccentricity.Lord Gordon seems to have thought that anything he said about the Catholicmonarchs of Catholic France would be indulged by British public opinion and byBritish governmental policy. In such false security he wrote a vile libelagainst Marie-Antoinette—no worse, to be sure, than many things beingsurreptitiously published in France but unfortunately for him not surreptitious.The agents of King Louis sued. No powerful protectors arose in Westminster toshield him. On the contrary, there was in some circles undisguised delight thathe had for a second time stuck his head into a noose. This time he had to flee,defeated and disgraced, to the Netherlands. Cagliostro had to pretend that hehardly knew the man—a difficult assignment given their notorious friendship andcollaboration.IV. The End of the StoryCagliostro had a couple of more “occult” episodes in England, but his star hadlong since waned, and he crossed the Channel back to the Continent in 1787 adefeated man, a “premature anti-fascist” of the Revolution perhaps. The everloyal Serafina, now ailing, was of course with him. Not daring to set foot onFrench soil, he traveled by the Netherlandish route toward Switzerland, where inBasel his old patron Sarazin was still alive, and still generous. It was inBasel that he founded the next to last of his Egyptian lodges, though it seemsnot to have amounted to much. Such luster as he had gained as a martyr to Frenchtyranny had now faded. There were so many more recent and more noble martyrs. Hehad always had his enemies, and the widely circulated libels of Théveneau deMorande had pushed a shaky reputation over the tipping point.His final travels are obscure. Why he should leave the comparative prosperity ofSarazin’s pension is not known, but one must conjecture that in Basel, too, hehad blotted his copybook in some frightful way. So he left Switzerland, headingsouth, which surely he should have realized meant heading for disaster. “Alltowns in which he was likely to be known were carefully avoided,” writesTrowbridge; “into such as seemed to offer a chance of concealment he creptstealthily.” Now he had no fancy carriage, no rich patrons, no packhorses ladenwith carefully wrapped glass beakers and retorts.He made his “last stand” in the Tyrolian town of Rovereto, an old burg(fortified place) on the northernmost border of the Venetian Republic, later tobecome the scene of one of Napoleon’s victories. It is a testimony to the nearlyuniversal diffusion of certain “occult” gestures of Freemasonry that he was ableto found his last “Egyptian” lodge there, which he rather grandiosely declaredan affiliate of the “great” lodge of Lyon. Even there his reputation soon caughtup with him, and we know about the whole episode mainly through a Latinburlesque of medieval form entitled “The Gospel According to St. Cagliostro.”The net effect of his stay in Rovereto was that he suffered an order ofexpulsion from the Holy Roman emperor Joseph II himself.Cagliostro now made a succession of desperate moves. He went to Trent, somethirty kilometers from Rovereto, where he sought the patronage of PietroVirgilio Thun, the prince-bishop. He perhaps hoped to repeat his success withcardinal de Rohan at Strassburg. But the archbishop, while very interested inthe possibilities of transmuting gunmetal into gold, would bear no truck withthe Masons. Cagliostro and Serafina made formal professions of penance, andsought full reconciliation with the Roman Church. It is impossible to gauge themood in which Cagliostro undertook this mad act, which involved the formalabjuration of all his Egyptian occultism, but it was clearly done in extremis.Its only practical effect was later to compound the Inquisition’s charges ofsorcery with the serious aggravation of apostasy. Trowbridge and others thinkthat he had hoped to escape north, to Protestant Germany, where numerousIlluminés and Rosicrucians had taken refuge, but the imperial ban now made thatcourse too dangerous.Cagliostro’s recent Italian biographer, Paolo Cortesi, has published a fewdocuments relating to this period. On February 21, 1789, Thun wrote to theapostolic legate in Milan sounding him out as to the possibility thatCagliostro, now officially penitent, might take up residence there withoutmolestation. Nothing appears to have come from that initiative, as we find Thunwriting again in similar vein to the ecclesiastical authorities in Rome thefollowing month. (We are now within the semester of the fall of the Bastille.)The libels of Théveneau de Morande had been republished even in the press ofRovereto. So he speaks of Cagliostro as a person notorious—as he had indeedbecome notorious throughout Europe at the time of the Necklace Affair—but nowimpoverished and penitent, married to a loyal wife, a distressed Roman citizenpining to make peace with her very aged parents. The bishop’s plea onCagliostro’s behalf was based only partly on the grounds of hardship. It wasprimarily a triumphalist proclamation that Religion had reclaimed a famouspractitioner of infidel Philosophy.So Cagliostro now went to Rome, where we find him arriving on May 27. He andSerafina were penniless, and their hope of survival depended upon achievingobscurity. There is no evidence that they reconnected with Serafina’s family, oreven tried to do so. Rome was a big city for the age (about 150,000 inhabitants)with a substantial demimonde of paupers and transients. While such a populationmight be quite good for offering a kind of social camouflage, it was lesspromising as an arena for inconspicuous and legitimate economic activity.Furthermore, as Cortesi writes, “If there was in 1789 a city in which a Masonought not set foot, it was Rome.” The same was as true, perhaps more true, forunconvincingly ex-Masons.Cagliostro’s only means of earning a living was charlatanism, his strangemixture of street-corner hucksterism and folk medicine. This was not a mode oflife designed to escape the notice of the police authorities or, through them,of his unconvinced and unforgiving ecclesiastical enemies. By now there wasrevolution beyond the Alps. Each week news reached the Papal Curia of yet moreoutrageous results of Enlightenment. And here in the very seat of Holy MotherChurch was a notorious “friend of mankind,” an insulter of sacred majesty, andan intimate of Lord George Gordon!Cortesi calls Cagliostro’s persecution by the Roman Inquisition inevitable andpredictable. Once it began, in the autumn of 1789, we have no historical sourcesother than those of the persecuting agencies themselves. What I have called theInquisition biography is really a prosecutor’s indictment in biographical form.Having served its immediate purpose, it has continued to prove mischievous fortwo centuries in the kangaroo court of history.The quickest way to expose the maestro’s heresies would be the damning testimonyof Serafina (now Laurenza Feliciani once again). She was already a nervous wreckby the time the pair had reached Trent; now she was putty in the hands of theinquisitors. She told them whatever they wanted to hear, beginning with herspouse’s recidivist “Egyptianism” and his continuing practice of black magic.After some weeks of harassment the authorities seized Cagliostro just afterChristmas 1789, and confiscated his possessions, which unfortunately includedhis holograph manuscript of the Egyptian rite. What more did they need? Theythrew him into the holding pens of Castel Sant’ Angelo. The “debriefed” Serafinawas sent off to enjoy the enforced “hospitality” of the Convent of SantaAppollonia. For Cagliostro, it was déjà vu all over again. As he had oncelanguished desperate and incommunicado in the Bastille, he now languisheddesperate and incommunicado in the fortress of Sant’ Angelo. Only after severalmonths did his interrogation begin. It continued, with varying levels ofintensity, from the late spring through the autumn. Surely the prosecutors canseldom have had an easier case, since no matter how preposterous the chargesmight be, there was a good chance they were actually true. The man was, afterall, “on record” as having claimed to be as old as Toth, and like Hercules andJesus Christ the offspring of a mixed marriage—human and divine.All the charges brought against him boiled down to a single accusation:Freemasonry! But blasphemy, sorcery, black magic, and gross impiety andtheological error were insufficient for these ecclesiastical judges who, howeverobscurantist, did have some political sense of the importance of European publicopinion. So they added to the accusations a number of charges of base secularcriminality: extortion, forgery, counterfeiting, confidence swindling, andwhoremongering, many of which had already long been part of the whisper campaignthat supplemented the newspaper articles of Théveneau de Morande, and most ofwhich the European public was willing to believe. All these threads of iniquityjoined to form one stout cord of “revolutionary sedition.” The once intimatecompanion of the cardinal de Rohan had been transformed to sans-culotte.Count Cagliostro enjoyed the formality of a competent defender, but the coercedevidence of his wife, whom he never again was allowed to see and whom (after abrief moment of shock) he continued to hold in affection, was regarded asdefinitive. After a preposterously unjust process, the Inquisition reached itsfinal verdict of guilt on April 7, 1791. The terms of the judgment do notdisguise the papal obsession with Freemasonry. The most important clause has todo with the public burning of the manuscript of the Egyptian rite. The anathemaagainst Masonry is comprehensive: “making particular mention of the Egyptiansect and of another vulgarly known as the ‘Illuminés’ … we shall decree that themost grievous corporal punishments reserved for heretics shall be inflicted onall who shall associate, hold communion with, or protect these societies.”The blind bigotry of the churchmen was not redeemed by their unctuousself-congratulation for showing mercy on a recreant who so richly merited death,but was to be allowed to live out his days in perpetual imprisonment. Thejudgment revolted thinking Europe. Even the French translator of the Inquisitionbiography—happy enough to honor its slanders—had to express his disgust with theInquisition. But to condemn the Inquisition was not the same thing as torehabilitate Cagliostro. Trowbridge cites a revealing article in a journalcalled the Feuille Villageoise: “The Pope ought to have abandoned Cagliostro tothe effects of his bad reputation. Instead he has had him shut up and tried bycharlatans far more dangerous to society than himself. His sentence is cruel andridiculous. If all who make dupes of the crowd were punished in this fashion,precedence on the scaffold should certainly be granted to the RomanInquisitors.”The rest is legend, but not improbable legend. Cagliostro is supposed to haveattempted a violent escape from Sant’ Angelo. He invited a Capuchin confessorinto his cell and asked him to discipline (that is, flagellate) him with hisFranciscan’s cord. The friar happily undertook this work of charity, but thepenitent then leapt up, seized the cord, and attempted to strangle him. The ideawas to walk out of the prison disguised in the throttled man’s habit. But thefriar succeeded in repulsing the attack. The papal authorities now transferredCagliostro to the dreaded prison of San Leo. This was the Alcatraz or Devil’sIsland of Roman penitentiaries. No one escaped from the rock of San Leo, whereCagliostro died on August 26, 1795. A little later, intelligence officers amongNapoleon’s invading forces were shown the cell—really a well-like shaft—in whichhe is supposed to have died.BibliographicalSimon Burrows’s A King’s Ransom: The Life of Charles Théveneau de Morande,Blackmailer, Scandalmonger, and Master-Spy (New York & London, 2010) is a majorcontribution to the cultural history of the milieu of Cagliostro.

The most famousportrait of the younger Madame de Krüdener was painted by Angelica Kauffmann.8 Julie de Krüdener Mondaine [../Text/content.xhtml#ch8]CHATEAUBRIAND, A CELEBRATED acquaintance of Julie de Krüdener, once said of her,after she had become famous or notorious in half of Europe, “I have known Madamede Krüdener mondaine, and I have known Madame de Krüdener dévote.” She wasalways the same Madame de Krüdener. Mondaine means “worldly” and dévote “pious.”He was instinctively using the language of the autobiographies of famousreligious converts who starkly divide their lives into two parts, a before andan after, with the “before” section often treated mainly with an embarrassedsilence. We find such distinctions for instance in the writings of St.Augustine, of Francis of Assisi, or (coming somewhat closer to our subject’stime and place) of Jeanne de Chantal, George Fox, and John Wesley. That wouldalso be one plausible way of deploying the life of Julie de Krüdener(1764–1824), the subject of this chapter. Such is in fact the pattern that sheherself, in some of her later letters, seems to have imposed upon her own life.Yet if we are to understand the continuities of that life as well as itsdramatic discontinuities, if we are to relate the elements of Julie’s life tomajor themes and moods of the Enlightenment period, we must divide its “before”section into at least two movements. These might be variously described: thedomestic and the artistic, the training in sentiment and the expression ofsentiment, the search for fame and the gaining of fame. For before Julie deKrüdener became notorious as a prophet, she had become famous as a writer.Fame is, of course, a relative phenomenon and often enough a transitory one.Julie de Krüdener is no longer a famous writer. Indeed, so far has she fallenfrom literary fame that even some experts in French literature know little morethan her name, and some do not know even that. Before attempting a very briefsketch of her life, therefore, we would perhaps do well to call upon theintermediary offices of a contemporary, a onetime friend and confidante, a womanwhose literary fame has better endured than has Julie’s: Madame de Staël.In 1810 Madame de Staël, already famous, published her book about Germany: Del’Allemagne. We shall hear more about this formidable woman of letterspresently; for the moment it is the impact of this book that concerns us. At thebeginning of the nineteenth century there was, strictly speaking, no “Germany”to write about. Political unification, and the emergence of a definite sense of“German” nationality, still lay in the future. What existed at this time was alarge geographical area of petty states, kingdoms, principalities, and duchiesin which various versions of the German language were spoken. In some of themmajor contributions of the very highest order to “the advancement of learning,”as the Enlightenment enterprise often called itself, were abundant. It isimpossible to think of eighteenth-century music without German-speakingcomposers. No more easily can one approach the study of philosophy withoutinvoking Kant and a dozen others. From “Germany” came huge advances inphilological study. German-speaking scholars revolutionized biblical andtheological studies.images [../Images/p299.jpg]Madame de Staël decked out as the poet and “woman of genius” who is the heroineof her novel Corinne (1807), in a painting by Elisabeth Vigée Lebrun. Stagedtableaux in which beautiful women were presented as historical or allegoricalfigures—such as Valérie’s presentation as Truth—were all the rage. The visualallusion to Sappho is obvious. The fantastic plot of Corinne is the vehicle fora brilliant “travel book” about Italy, and yet another tedious exploration ofthe conflict between natural authenticity and social artificiality. Julie deKrüdener wavered between being the author and the subject of her own novel.Under these circumstances, the self-imposed task of Madame de Staël to“introduce” German language literature to the cultivated European literarypublic may seem a little curious. Certain special cultural realities of the agemake it perhaps less so. Great writers of German appeared in force in the secondhalf of the eighteenth century, but the German language itself remainedsomething of an orphan. French remained the language of the courts of theContinent, including the petty courts of Germany. Readers of Tolstoy, a greatdocumenter of the nineteenth-century Russian aristocracy, will recall hisFrench-speaking Russian aristocrats.This was one paradoxical insularity of “Germany,” and to it a second wasattached. In England and in France, philosophy seemed to have lost itsuniversalizing ambitions. The project of medieval philosophy, best typified inthe Summa theologica of St. Thomas but amply exemplified by some dozens ofothers, had been global and universal. That’s what the word summa meant. The“modern” philosophers of England and France had turned their backs onphilosophical universalizing, but the Germans loved it.Such, at any rate, were some of the explanations offered by Madame de Staël’slarge book for the ignorance of German culture encountered everywhere in France.Very few Frenchmen knew German, she claims. Furthermore, while German translateswell into other Germanic languages (Scandinavian, English), just as Frenchtranslates well into other Romance vernaculars, there is a barrier forever fixedby the river Rhine. He who would cross it needed a guide: to wit, Madame deStaël.As a guide, Madame de Staël was brilliant but perhaps partial. She had hertheories. Cultural stereotypes are of course themselves culturally constructed,not eternal truths. Our common views of the stolid, industrious, law-abidingGerman, no less than of the hot-blooded, passionate, or feckless Mediterranean,are of comparatively recent development. Madame de Staël had other stereotypes.According to her, the culture of the “Latins” had antedated Christianity, andmelded with it. For the “German,” Christianity had been the vehicle of cultureitself. There was, accordingly, a purer strain of idealism in the North, ofchivalry in its purest sense. For many enlightened minds of the eighteenthcentury the word “Gothic” was a term of abuse, on a par with its fellow,“Vandal.” Madame de Staël is among the first to use the “Gothic” in a whollypositive way, and to charge it with a penumbra of Romantic associations, whichit has never entirely lost. “The scene: a Gothic turret at midnight. EnterManfred alone.”De l’Allemagne had a large influence in forming popular ideas about a supposedcultural divide between North and South, between Protestantism and Catholicism,between the freshness of Nature and the staleness of Artifice. Many of her ideaslive on today in howsoever attenuated a form. The “American” theme in HenryJames was one manifestation of Madame de Staël’s paradigm. The conflict betweenwinners and wasters in the euro zone might be said to be another. The denizensof “the North” were, according to theory, especially conspicuous for a Romanticdepth of soul, and for a consciousness of Nature relatively free of the socialcorruptions of civilization. One of the favorite adjectives of the RomanticSchool was “hyperborean,” a made-up classicism meaning “far northern.” Among the“hyperborean” regions that captured the French cultural imagination, the Balticlittoral from Copenhagen to St. Petersburg was especially prominent. Onehyperborean from those parts is the principal subject of this chapter: Julie deKrüdener.Barbara Juliana Vietinghof, better known as Julie de Krüdener, became in timethe competitor and ambiguous friend of Madame de Staël. The relationship wasfitting, for if Julie had not quite been created in the pages of De l’Allemagneshe certainly seemed to exemplify its principal arguments to perfection. Juliede Krüdener was a great “character” in an age of great characters, but she ishardly known today. One struggles to find a plausible modern analogue. Think,perhaps, of a combination of Danielle Steele and Mother Teresa.One of the precepts of De l’Allemagne was that for historical reasons notnecessarily obvious, the North was much more firmly attached to its medievalroots than were many other parts of Europe. So far as Livonia was concerned, thetheory seems convincing. Livonia was the old name of the Baltic provinces of theold Russian Empire—what is now Latvia, with parts of modern Lithuania andEstonia. Julie de Krüdener was born into one of the most ancient anddistinguished families of the Livonian aristocracy.By the standards of much of the rest of Europe, perhaps, this was not all thatancient. Livonia had been one of the last places annexed by Christians fromancient heathendom. Its conquest was still in progress at the dawn of the modernage. Chaucer, writing a description of an ideal Christian knight around the year1400, says that his Englishman distinguished himself “above alle nacions inPruce.” That is, his exploits distinguished him among the knights of manynationalities in the wars in Prussia. He adds: “In Lettow had he reysed[campaigned] and in Ruce …” Lettow is the modern Lithuania, and the rathergeneral references to Prussia and Russia invoke precisely those Balticborderlands, then so remote and so hotly disputed, that would one day be theLivonia of Julie de Krüdener.In the later Middle Ages Europe’s borderlands increasingly fell under the swayof the military orders, those strange communities of warrior monks called intobeing by the crusading ideal. These included the Knights Templar and theHospitallers, primarily associated with the “eastern” fronts, first in the LatinKingdom of Jerusalem, then in Malta and other Mediterranean islands in which theChristians hoped to hold the line against Islamic expansionism. In the IberianPeninsula there were several military orders that played important roles in theReconquest and, later, in creating and preserving its history. In thehyperborean regions, where the challenges were rather different and immenselycomplicated from the political point of view, the most prominent group was theOrder of St. Mary’s Hospital in Jerusalem, usually called simply the TeutonicOrder or the Teutonic Knights on account of their principal catchment area inthe Low German regions eastward from Flanders. By the year 1200 all of theseorders were, according to their historian, “rich, famous, and effective.”The Teutonic Knights included a specifically Livonian battalion founded aroundthe beginning of the thirteenth century, the date of the first crusadingoperations in the Baltic. Its knights were called the “Brothers of the Army ofChrist,” with the nickname of “Sword-Brothers” or “Sword-Bearers.” The lastpapally endorsed campaign of the Sword-Brothers came in the early sixteenthcentury, on the very eve of the Protestant Reformation. The generals within theorder were usually called masters, and one of the most famous masters of Livoniawas Konrad von Vietinghof, who flourished in the last part of the fourteenthcentury and first part of the fifteenth. Many heroic exploits were attributed toKonrad von Vietinghof, and some of them may have actually occurred. ThisVietinghof was the direct ancestor by unbroken father-to-son descent of Julie deKrüdener’s father, Otto Hermann, Baron von Vietinghof.Martin Luther had made a special appeal to the Teutonic Orders. They largelyignored it, but most were unable to resist the more forceful invitations toProtestantism offered a little later by the Peasants’ Revolt. The old Teutoniclands, as was true of most of the northern and eastern German-speaking lands,became for the most part Lutheran. The Catholic religious orders were of coursesuppressed, but the Livonian Knights were transformed rather than abolished.Their legendary importance in the history of Livonia was too great simply to beforgotten, and for a couple of centuries they continued to have a secularizedceremonial existence. By Julie’s time these orders bore about as muchrelationship to their original ideals as does the New Orleans Mardi Gras to thepreparations for a holy Lent. The recently re-Catholicized Napoleon suppressedthem in 1809. There was no greater social cachet in Livonia than to be aVietinghof of the Vietinghofen.The baron Otto, Julie’s father, was a distinguished man in his time,distinguished and decidedly “enlightened” as well. In a paradigm of almostMarxist purity, he exemplified the transition from landed aristocrat tocapitalist entrepreneur by founding and then maintaining a large and prosperousdistillery. He was active in local dramatic and literary affairs. Thus Julie DeKrüdener grew up in a “literary ambience.” According to E. J. Knapton’sexcellent biography, “his most dazzling stroke was the erection of a privatetheater, opened in 1782 with a performance of Lessing’s Emilia Galotti.” Helater sold the theater to the town, but under a special arrangement that gavehim access to a door connecting his private house with a pair of theater stalls.SINCE JULIE WOULD EVENTUALLY become famous for her religious ideas, it isnecessary to trace some of the currents of her early spiritual formation. InRiga, where her father settled, what might be called the “religious background”was particularly rich. Riga was at that time a city in the czar’s empire. Theofficial religion of the place was Russian Orthodoxy, but Orthodoxy there had noreal roots and was confined to a small class of colonial bureaucrats. Before itstemporary absorption by the Russian Empire, the area had been solidly Lutheran.The Vietinghofs were a Lutheran family. The father, not untypical of his timeand social class, seems to have found his principal religious outlet among theMasons. The mother was a zealous and devout Lutheran, Julie herself a nominalone. By the middle of the eighteenth century the ostensible followers of Lutherhad mostly settled into the doldrums of all state churches. Remember Lecky’sdescription of the theology of the Church of England: “an admirable auxiliary tothe police force.” This probably gives a not inaccurate sense of aristocraticLivonian Lutheranism as well.Christianity was the foundation of the state. It was a school of good deportmentand citizenship, and an encouragement to the faithful fulfillment of politicaland familial duty. Civic respectability by no means precluded personal piety,but it did not encourage “fanaticism.” Julie de Krüdener’s mother was an uprightand faithful Christian who sought by word and deed to instill religiousprinciples in her children. Just as in England religious fervor, which founditself unwelcome in the state Church, found an outlet in Methodism, religiousfervor in Livonia found its outlet in several more or less extravagant sects ofPietism. Finally, all of the Baltic cities, but perhaps Riga in particular, hadimportant Jewish communities. There were many erudite Talmudists in the town. Itis not unlikely that directly or indirectly some of her later apocalypticismfound its seeds in their teachings.Contrasting, perhaps, with a somewhat cosmopolitan religious scene was Livonia’sretrograde social system. The unusual cultural complexity of Livonia was thepartner of a profound social conservatism, perhaps better called simplybackwardness. The Peasants’ Revolt had changed the region’s religion, but leftmainly intact the old oppressive social relations. Serfdom, essentiallyunchanged from the time of the Middle Ages, was the basis for the region’sabundant agricultural production. It was a lucrative system—lucrative for thelandowners, that is. Julie de Krüdener’s first recorded “progressive” ideas—shewas to have many others later on—were those of a proto-abolitionist. It issobering to recall that the emancipation proclamation of Czar Alexander IIantedates that of Abraham Lincoln by two years. De jure slavery had barely beenextinguished at the time of Julie’s birth, and its de facto offspring was aliveand kicking during her formative youth.A “Good” MarriageThe principal modern biography of Julie de Krüdener was written in 1961 byFrancis Ley, her last lineal descendant. Ley, an able amateur historian, hadassembled an impressive archive of important papers relating to her, many ofthem his personal property, and richly distributed throughout his book, which isa source indispensable for anyone desiring to know his curious ancestor.Furthermore, Ley had an impressively broad command of the diary literature ofthe period, and particularly that of his family and its immediate circle. Evenwithout ties of blood, however, the relationship between an historian and hishuman subject matter may become blurred by intimacy, and the reader of Madame deKrüdener et son temps may from time to time have some qualms on this score. Oneproblem is that Ley appears to regard Julie’s novel Valérie as a rather simplycoded autobiography.Julie’s husband, the baron de Krüdener, was of old Livonian stock, too. Hisblood was scarcely less blue than Julie’s own. The age of modern diplomacy wasstill in its youth, and the baron was an excellent and enlightened examplar ofthe highly polished professional civil servants seen in the background ofpictorial representations of Tilsit, the Congress of Vienna, or the VersaillesConference. Just as it was an age of mercenary soldiers, it was an age ofmercenary diplomats. The baron spent his career working in the service of theRussian emperors.There is a mystery about this man, or at least about the apparent complaisancewith which Julie married him. He was more than twice her age. More importantfrom the point of view of the mores of the age, he was a man with a past. He hadalready been twice married and twice divorced. By his first wife, a Scottisharistocrat from whom he parted after two years, he had a daughter, Sophie, whowas destined to become Julie’s intimate friend and surrogate sister. He thenmarried another highborn woman from the Baltic states, but their union proved tobe shorter still. All this was decidedly irregular; yet on September 20, 1782,the two were married with all the usual displays of aristocraticself-satisfaction.The baron’s first postmarital assignment was in Mitau (now Jelgava), animportant town in Latvia where we may recall Count Cagliostro had performedimportant operations. His task was to help ease the province’s annexation intothe empire of Catherine the Great. There is evidence that for a couple of yearsJulie may have been happy in the marriage—or if not happy, at least notbroodingly unhappy. There may have been something of the admiration of aDesdemona for an Othello. In a sketch written at the time, Julie speaks of himas “a just and expansive spirit, adorned with a large variety of pleasing anduseful skills.” One skill of ambiguous usefulness, it would appear, was the easeand frequency with which the baron charmed other women.She became pregnant quite soon. On January 31, 1784, her beloved son was born.He was named Paul after his godfather, the future Paul I, emperor of all theRussias (1796–1801). Young Paul de Krüdener himself would later become one ofRussia’s early ministers to the fledgling United States of America, and was tofollow a brilliant and important diplomatic career in Europe. These weredefinitely top-drawer people. The stay in Mitau, however, was brief. The baronwas to be reassigned to Venice, and in the autumn of 1784 the little familymoved on to St. Petersburg where the baron was to receive his instructions andprepare for the move.The visit to St. Petersburg, though short, was in certain respects formative.The young bride, still only a girl really, was formally presented at the courtof the empress Catherine, already in her lifetime being called by many “theGreat.” There for the first time she met the Czarevitch Alexander, then a lad ofbut seven years, who would many years later become her collaborator in thesemi-mystical political project known as the “Holy Alliance.”It is not easy to imagine the conditions of travel in which the family wastransported, together with a considerable household of their personal domesticproperty, in two lumbering heavy coaches from the shores of the North Sea tothose of the Adriatic. Francis Ley suggests that it was during this trip thatJulie “began to become aware of the shortcomings, real or imagined, of herhusband.” Julie had been a “scribbler” since her youth. We even have somejournals from her childhood. More important, perhaps, Ley possessed a diary, towhich either he or Julie herself had given the title Journal of My First Yearsof Marriage (1782–1786), in which we find the first but abundant signs of theextravagant emotionality and self-absorbed interrogation of “inner states” thatwould become a permanent part of her spiritual personality. This diary alsorecords, often in poignant detail, her growing realization of what Ley calls the“incompatibilities” of her marital situation.These incompatibilities were both dramatic and banal. They boiled down, asmarital incompatibilities so often do, to differences in temperament, then inthe quality of the response to the differences in temperament. Julie loved theLivonian wilds, stark, cruel, and monotonous as they often might appear toothers. The baron was not without an appreciation of Nature, but his tastesfavored the conventionally picturesque, such as the Venetian canals, in whichJulie took little pleasure. Most of all he admired the splendid architecture ofcapital cities. Julie delighted in rustic retreats and the open countryside.Soon she was diagnosing her incipient unhappiness as the result of a spiritualloneliness. “My tears flow, my heart is once again oppressed, and I have no oneto tell of my sorrows,” she wrote in her journal. “I utterly lack the sweet andconsoling satisfaction of weeping with a friend. I am all alone here, far fromall those to whom I am dear. I am here instead with that one who long has for metaken the place of them all, with a husband I love passionately. But it is notwith him that I can speak of my sorrows; he is their cause without wishing to beso. Or rather it is I myself who causes them. They arise from a soul too ardent,from a sensibility too lively, from a heart too loving.…” It must seem clear toany reader that the phrase “a husband I love passionately” was probably aliterary species of whistling in the dark.A Diplomat’s Restless WifeTheir next assignment, and the last as an actually married couple, was toCopenhagen, where the baron was made the czar’s ambassador. This posting was ofgreater significance than one might at first imagine, for the empress Catherinewas at the time trying to line up Scandinavian support for renewed hostilitieswith Turkey. In her journal for this period Julie becomes quite explicit abouther suspicions concerning her husband, whose gallantry toward the wife of theDanish secretary of state, Charlotte von Beulwitz, seemed to her to exceed therequirements of diplomacy.In the summer of 1787, the baroness gave birth to their second child, a daughternamed Juliette (Julie). The delivery was difficult and dangerous. In retrospectits accomplishment appears perhaps to have seemed to Julie de Krüdener thesufficient fulfillment of marital duty. She stayed on with her husband, amid hisintermittent professional absences, for two years more. There was no thirddivorce, although separation does appear to have been seriously discussed. Butfrom this period forward the baron would no longer be the significant factor inher emotional life, despite the fact that he continued for a time to be aserious practical convenience. Her own mind was perhaps not yet entirelysettled. From time to time in her correspondence she mentions vague hopes of anunspecified reunion. Julie judged herself ill, and she set off on an indefinitevoyage of recuperation. We have no means of assessing with accuracy the degreeto which the issue of health was pretext or precipitating cause. The parting wasto all appearances an amicable one, and it obviously included financialarrangements more or less satisfactory to the husband.In early 1789, Julie de Krüdener set off. Her eventual goal was some retreat inthe South, later to be determined. But there would first be a stop in Paris,where on May 5, Louis XVI convened the first meeting of the Estates-General tobe convoked in a couple of centuries. She had her own modest rendezvous withdestiny, for 1789, so prominent a punctuation point in the history of France andindeed the world, was for Julie likewise a decisive turning point. This was theyear that in retrospect marked the effective end of her married life, and theeffective beginning of her life as a writer and a doctor of sentiment.It is clear that by now Julie had decided that the audience for her sharedsentiments could not be a husband so unsuited by his nature for the delicatetask. It would be, instead, the world at large, or at least that portion of itthat was the reading public. What is much less clear is how, precisely, sheintended to gain the public ear. She would require first some education in theworld of letters, a goal toward which she set out confidently. She would seekout, to the degree that opportunity would allow it, the counsel and friendshipof successful writers much admired. And although her plan took a decade to findits fruition in literary fame of her own, it proved in the end to have been asound one. As she set out upon it, she cannot possibly have intuited that thedecade would be perhaps the most tumultuous in the history of Europe.She took with her not merely her own two children but the baron’s daughterSophie, who now clearly had become closer to the stepmother than to her naturalfather, a fact that perhaps says something about the human sympathies of boththe baron and the baroness. The destination, though not yet absolutely fixed,was some pleasant place in the South of France where, free of the demands of herhusband’s diplomatic life, she could rest and recuperate in seclusion. To getthere from the North, one must first pass through Paris, where she would stayfor a season and take her first steps toward the literary salons and the life ofa writer. A cohort of the shifting, glittering, peripatetic internationalaristocracy were always in residence in Paris, including naturally some from theBaltic North. One index of the increasing scale of travel in the eighteenthcentury was the large stock of rental properties generally available in theeighteenth-century European capitals. Julie found friends and relatives to showher about and settle her in. Where she wanted to be settled tells us a good dealabout the evolution of her self-image. For she was now more and more thinking ofherself as a writer, and among the people she was most eager to meet were otherwriters. She had read two French authors with especial admiration: Bernardin deSaint-Pierre and the abbé Jean-Jacques Barthélemy. One link between the twoaging literary lions was a vision that combined Enlightenment erudition and thegenres of Romantic fiction.Salon Culture on the Eve of the RevolutionOne of the great cultural institutions of the Enlightenment was the salon, whichmight be described as a kind of domestic seminar directed by a person—usually awoman—of recognized intellectual ability, social position, and personal charm.The word salon, of course, means the sitting room or a parlor, the more publicand social space within the domestic environment. (In English, the word “wentbad” in “saloon.”) Within it the director or directrice held open house atregular hours of a specific day or days of the week. The “friends of the house”had a standing invitation to the salon, and frequently a regular clientele woulddevelop.The salon first rose to prominence in France in the seventeenth century. Then itwas a species of satellite or colony of the court, serving as a kind of academyof good breeding, in which genteel and amusing conversation might be conductedagainst a background of elegantly deployed manners and social rituals. It wasthus similar in many respects to other forms of more or less regular sociabilitythat developed during this period. Examples would include the coffeehouse, thetea party, the Masonic Lodge, the academic society, and in various parts ofEurope religious sodalities and confraternities now considerably transformedfrom their medieval origins.Already in the seventeenth century the salon was demonstrating some of theimportant cultural features that characterized the high point of itsefflorescence in the following century: the prominence of the women who held theopen houses, and the evolution of the salon as a particular meeting place of theliterati. Women’s cultural power in the Old World often found its outlet in asomewhat oblique fashion. For the long centuries of the European Middle Ages itschief arena was the female religious house, or convent of nuns, which from itsvery inception established a gender-exclusive atmosphere in which women mustperforce take on most offices of leadership. The salon, operating within thedomestic sphere of the private house, naturally offered women the opportunity toexercise the role of intellectual leadership not easily found elsewhere in thepublic society.The doyens of the salon of the seventeenth century were sometimes called “theprecious ones,” the term précieuses then being an unironic compliment tointelligence and recognized cultural prestige. Among them were Madame deRambouillet and Madame de Sablé. The former presided over the famous hôtel deRambouillet, one of the great domestic centers of learning and culture in Paris.According to all accounts, Madame de Rambouillet was a woman in whom a lightlyworn erudition united with attractive human sympathy and great charm. Her actualname had been Catherine de Vivonne, and from it she artfully created by way ofanagram the nom de salon of “Arthénice,” a name without historical precedent orany certain significance, yet suggestive both of a vague classical antiquity andof the romantic Middle Ages. Arthénice presided over conversations of suchsparkling wit as to attract most of the famous writers of the capital. Theseincluded, among so many other once famous wits and conversationalists, the likesof Corneille, Malesherbes, and La Rochefoucauld. The ecumenical attraction ofthe salon is perhaps suggested by the presence of Saint-Évremond (a notablerepresentative of the freethinking libertins) and Bishop Bossuet (certainly themost famous sacred orator of the age).Madame de Sablé could perhaps be described as the Jansenists’ answer to thehôtel de Rambouillet or, perhaps, the Lady Anne Conway of the Gauls. She was aCatholic intellectual of unusually penetrating intelligence, who toward the endof her life became one of the “solitaries” at Port-Royal. La Rochefoucauld wasfrequently in attendance at her establishment as well as that of Arthénice, andactually seems to have undertaken the composition of his “Maxims” with the helpof the company assembled. Madame de Sablé’s reputation for rigor of thought isperhaps suggested by the fact that the “Great” Arnauld, the intellectualchampion of the Jansenists, consulted her in the composition of his famous“Port-Royal Logic.”The prestige of the female-led salon reached its high point in thepre-Revolutionary decades of the eighteenth century. Famous salonistes of thisperiod include Madame d’Épinay, the friend of such cultural heavyweights asDiderot and Grimm, Madame de Geoffrin, who on Mondays received painters and onWednesdays scholars and writers, and Madame de Scudéry, alias “Sappho,” anovelist of ability, and certainly of contemporary popularity, who reigned overthe Parisian Saturday. Rousseau and Voltaire were lions of the salon, as indeedwere most of the famous French writers and scholars of the century.The salon survived the Revolution, and continued after a fashion into thenineteenth century. Indeed, it survived in transmogrified form in the political“circles” of postwar Paris (such as that of Sartre and de Beauvoir) and perhapscan be said to survive to this very day, or at least to swell the coffers of theproprietors of the Café des Deux Magots. Nonetheless, salon culture was on thewane by the time Julie arrived in the capital in 1789. But the same kind ofnostalgic time lag that led American writers of the fifties to search in Parisfor the vanished twenties world of Hemingway and Gertrude Stein led Julie deKrüdener to seek her fortune among the salons of the capital.BERNARDIN DE SAINT-PIERRE, with whom Julie was to develop a real intimacy,remains among the major figures of early French Romanticism. One of his books,which had then been very recently published, is Paul et Virginie. It was a bestseller of the age, and it deserved to be. It is a great novel, and one thattranscends its dated sentimentality and Romantic excesses. Paul and Virginie aretwo children of Nature raised in the wild on the island of Mauritius in theIndian Ocean, at that time a colonial possession of France. The theme of courseis the corrupting power of the sophistications of civilization as they waragainst the innocence and rectitude of Natural Man. One critic has said that thebook expresses the Rousseauian ideal better than anything written by Rousseauhimself. “Man is born free but everywhere he is in chains.”Those chains are not exhausted by political oppression, which is merely the mosthideous manifestation of social falsities of many kinds, one of which is theclass system upon which most of world history had been founded since the time ofits first recording. One could regard its pastoralism primarily in aestheticterms, as Marie-Antoinette and her sister shepherdesses cavorting aboutVersailles seemed to do; but if taken at all seriously Paul et Virginie was abook with a serious revolutionary potential. Paul et Virginie was in a sense the“social” supplement to Saint-Pierre’s earlier Studies of Nature, which Julie hadalso devoured with enthusiasm. Saint-Pierre is usually, and correctly, describedas a master of “sentiment,” and “sentiment” is sometimes held up in oppositionto cold Enlightenment rationality. In fact strong emotion, often called passion,was fervently praised by a number of the most eminent of Enlightenment thinkers,as for example Diderot.The abbé Barthélemy was one of the great scholars of the age, a classicalhistorian, a numismatist, and an archaeologist. He had been honored in his youthby the Royal Society in London, and Julie got to know him in his early sixtiesjust as he was being inducted into the French Academy. His most famous book wascalled The Journey of the Young Anacharsis in Greece in the Middle of the FourthCentury. This was not exactly a historical novel, but a novel in which thehistory was not background but foreground.It is an index of the attractive social texture of the old Republic of Lettersthat a talented acolyte like Julie de Krüdener could so easily gain access tothe literary great ones of the capital; but it is also a testimony to herpersonal charm and, one must add, determination. Without entirely realizing itshe had a ready-made connection with this aging writer. Many years earlier inRome, her grandfather had done Barthélemy some kind of favor. He remembered it,and greeted her warmly. According to his testimony this geriatric literarysuperstar received four hundred fan letters a year, mostly from women who warmlyappreciated his sentiment. He complained that he was unable to keep up with sucha correspondence, but this particular female admirer he received with alacrity.She visited Bernardin at his suburban salon, where she met among others Madamede Genlis. She began to see herself destined for the world of the salon.Somewhat oddly, perhaps, the woman who as a girl had developed a strong interestin social conditions seemed strangely opaque to the large political drama beingplayed out about her. The Bastille came tumbling down, not without alarums andgory violence. She does not write of this. She writes instead of her“nerves”—her lifelong and increasingly oppressive curse—and of her need toretreat to the calm of the countryside. For her that meant taking up residencefor a time in the South, at Montpellier.She was a nervous traveler in a double sense, for she could not keep still,moving on from Montpellier to Nîmes, and visiting far and wide through thesouthern countryside. It is from this period that the intensity of hercorrespondence with Bernardin de Saint-Pierre increases dramatically. One letterof particular note records her proto-Romantic reaction to a visit to theFontaine de Vaucluse, the site of Petrarch’s famous fourteenth-centuryrustication. Here Julie de Krüdener was predictably overwhelmed with “profoundemotions”; and she claims half seriously to have had an actual vision ofPetrarch. “There Petrarch appeared to me among those sacred vaults, which sawthe birth of his long passion for Laura.” Petrarch and Laura, along with Abelardand Héloïse and Dante and Beatrice, were one of the emotional triumvirate ofgreat medieval lovers.She was now (1790) ready for some passion of her own. Returning to Montpellier,she had an encounter with a dashing military officer, Charles-Louis deFrégeville. The circumstances were dramatic. Frégeville had arrived at the headof a cohort of national guardsmen who had come to deal with a band of insurgentJacobites. There was immediate “chemistry,” absurdly interrupted by an appealfrom the not-quite-forgotten husband in Copenhagen.She made many “last” acts of marital obligation, and she made one now. Shereturned to Copenhagen briefly, where according to Julie’s early historian E.Muhlenbeck, she informed the baron of the irrevocable transfer of affection toCaptain Frégeville. Details are lacking, but we soon enough find documentaryevidence of repentance. Was it founded in disappointment or in principle? Thebaron de Krüdener was now at least as much sinned against as sinning, and heseems to have been looking for a way out. At one point he was willing ifreluctant to contemplate a third divorce, but he was quite worried about thescandal of Julie’s traipsing about Europe with lovers in pursuit. He also seemsto have had a firmer sense than did his wife of the significance of the eventusually called the French Revolution. He proposed that she take up residence inLivonia, with her lover if desired, but quietly, until their affairs could befinally sorted out.Affairs of the HeartSome previous biographers of Julie de Krüdener have rather sensationalized hererotic life. She had a passionate heart, and she wore it on her sleeve. For herthe love between a man and woman must be sacramental, the union of the fleshfounded in the protocols of the heart and mind. Our own great Enlightenmentphilosopher, Benjamin Franklin, enunciated as a timeless principle that “Wherethere’s Marriage without Love, there will be Love without Marriage.” For Julieone should probably clarify by substituting for “Love” the less ambiguous word“Passion.” She had several lovers, by one of whom, a stripling youth who had notyet achieved his majority, she had an illegitimate son long hidden from theinquiries of her biographers. She can reasonably be described as a “victim oflove” perhaps not unlike Gustave de Linar, the hero of her novel, his soul inlove with love itself. But she was by no means promiscuous or lascivious, oreven, by her own standards, immoral. As always, we must assess her behavioragainst the background of her historical circumstances. For though sheentertained many political ideas that we would perhaps regard as “liberal,” shewas no less a prisoner of her own aristocratic social class than were many otherrevolutionary-minded liberals faced with the realities of an actual revolution.I have already alluded to what is probably an impenetrable mystery surroundingthe nature of her marriage. There was a conspicuous mismatch between themiddle-aged diplomat and the romantic teenager. One anecdote among many culledfrom her letters and her journal offers dramatic evidence of thehypersensitivity and egocentrism that her critics have found culpable. The childbride had unreasonable (we would say neurotic) worries about the safety of herhusband, especially any time he was on horseback. One day when he was awayriding and she awaited his scheduled return, a rainstorm began. She fretted forhis safety and could not restrain herself from setting off on foot to meet himalong the road—an act that was from any practical point of view foolish anduseless. When they met on the road, the nonplussed husband was so indelicate asto point this out to her. Why had she not stayed snug at home? That’s what hewould have done. This fatal want of emotional extravagance struck her like aknife to the heart.Soon after she came to the conclusion that hers would forever be a marriage ofsocial convention, very far indeed from the marriage of true minds, she soughtto bring to an end de jure a relationship which to her mind had never existed defacto. The only means of achieving this end of course would have been a legaldivorce. The baron, however, though he was willing to accommodate manyirregularities in his marital life, now backtracked on the idea of a thirddivorce. He no longer particularly wished to be married to Julie. She had, afterall, certain manifest liabilities. She could be quite selective in herparticipation in social events attendant upon the baron’s professional position,events that he was inclined to view as marital duties and she as voluntaryfavors. Furthermore, she seems to have been quite extravagant from the financialpoint of view. The fatal error was probably not vulgar materialism, but theunexamined habits of an upbringing of considerable luxury. Not to want to bemarried, however, is not the same thing as wanting to be divorced. The baron deKrüdener had already been twice divorced—a most extraordinary situation for aman of the eighteenth century, and particularly for one in the public eye. Hisreluctance to accept Julie’s suggestion was undoubtedly founded in prudence, inthe perceived necessity of following a life of conventional appearance if not ofconventional reality.Historians have found it too easy to adopt a censorious attitude toward thevarious members of the shifting Krüdener ménage. But idealism, even idealism ofapparently the purest cast, operates not within an ethical vacuum but within asocial context. Julie, the baron, and the baroness’s lovers were all, in theirown view, idealists. The compromises they made they could regard as having beenforced upon them by circumstance.The most dramatic episode in Julie’s emotional life must certainly be her givingbirth to an illegitimate son. Such an histoire naturally had a history, one soonrequiring some delineation. The event was, however, the denouement rather thanthe prelude to the major phase of Julie’s emotional liberation. In late 1786,when Baron Krüdener was transferred from the embassy in Venice to that inCopenhagen, he and his wife naturally passed through Lyon in central France.They were received by an official named Jean-Antoine Terray. Terray had a youngson, at that time twelve years old, destined for a major role in her futureemotional life. For the moment it was decided that Julie would stay for a timein the Midi in the hopes of recovering her fragile health.For a beautiful young married woman to establish her separate residence, asthough she were a widow, was perhaps to offer an invitation of sorts. Certainlyit is unlikely that a young wife could fall passionately in love with anotherman had she not already in some sense given herself the permission to do so.Julie soon attracted a number of interested male admirers.Her behavior during this period of her life was not, as her more severebiographers would have it, “shameless”; but it was insufficiently governed byprudence. In Julie de Krüdener’s entourage there was a young Swiss governess whoplayed a very important role in her life as friend and confidante. So great didtheir intimacy become that this woman—Mademoiselle Piozet, who after hermarriage was called Madame Armand—actually became the surrogate mother toJulie’s illegitimate son. There seems to have been very little if anything inher emotional life that she did not share with Madame Armand, who proved to be awise, efficient, and coolheaded friend, precisely the sort of person helpful intempering some of Julie’s serial enthusiasms without going so far as to quenchher spirit. Julie appears to have already shared with her the disappointmentsand sterilities of her married life. Now Madame Armand became the intermediaryof her extramarital emotional life, at times as guardian, at others asgo-between.Still the most socially notable of Julie’s admirers was the dashing cavalryofficer, the marquis Charles-Louis de Frégeville. This young man—he was actuallyJulie’s junior by a year—had gained a certain local reputation a year or twoearlier by protecting the citizens of Montpellier from some hooligans who weredisturbing the peace. There was chemistry between these two beautiful youngpeople, leading to the kind of unstable chemical compound usual in suchsituations. In fact they fell passionately in love. No episode in Julie’s lifehas proved a more convenient Rorschach inkblot for Madame de Krüdener’sbiographers than has this love affair with Frégeville. Charles Eynard, herChristian apologist, regards it as the terrible if vaguely sketched sin, whichis the expected prologue to the later sanctity of most of the saints of theChurch. Muhlenbeck, at times an impatient rationalist and to no small degree anunconscious male chauvinist, treats it as the nearly comic absurdity of a vainand frivolous female. Others, more generous in their view, seem to regard it asa necessary and perhaps forgivable manifestation of a superabundance of“passion.”Certainly there is every evidence of passion. She wrote at the time that theirweeks together in Montpellier were “the happiest” of her young life. For hispart, young Charles-Louis de Frégeville showed every sign of sincerity in thenature of his own abundant devotion. However, there were certain realities,which were bound to impinge upon the lovers’ idyll. She began to get importunateletters from her husband in Copenhagen urging her return to that city. Perhapshe had heard something, or guessed. So Julie and her lover decided, no doubtwith Julie in the lead, upon a flamboyant demonstration of “honor.” They wouldtravel to Copenhagen, where with a frankness as painful to them as to theaggrieved husband, they would make a clean breast of things. And so they set offnorthwards. According to Muhlenbeck, Frégeville traveled in the disguise of alackey. I have not found the documentary evidence for this suggestion, though ithas ample precedents in the Romance tradition, in which for various practicalreasons lovers frequently travel in disguise, usually as pilgrims. One verypractical consideration was that of Julie’s reputation. To make a clean breastof things before the husband might be noble; to do so before the entire worldwould be tasteless, not to mention potentially dangerous.There is some evidence to suggest that by the time they reached Copenhagen,where the military lover hovered about for some weeks, the couple had realizedthat they were possessed not by any eternal love but by an affair, poignantperhaps, but also unsustainable. Julie confessed everything to the baron, whoreacted with distaste and alarm, but with a degree of savoir-faire that fullyvindicated his high reputation as an effective diplomat. He resisted not so muchthe situation as Julie’s proposed solution to it: namely, a divorce. Thisquestion appears to have been decided in his mind already before it wasraised—or raised again, as it was implicit in the establishment of separateresidence in 1789. Although his wife’s occasional extravagances caused himfinancial worries, he would be in the long run dependent upon the ampleresources that he quite reasonably realized would inevitably come her way. Thiswas neither cynicism nor gross materialism, but rather submission to that genreof fact that tempered the real-life relations between the sexes. So he wouldagree to separate living arrangements, so long as scandal was avoided. Notsurprisingly, he hoped to see the back of Captain de Frégeville. Frégeville, whoin fact did go on to achieve an outstanding military career, was feeling anobligation to return to his regiment. He could not love Julie half so much lovedhe not honor more. He disappeared from the scene. Julie was surprisinglyindifferent. Although she did not yet realize it, she had already met the reallove of her life.Hippolyte TerrayEven the subtlest of social observers are sometimes reticent in the face of thegreat events of their time. One would hardly learn from the pages of America’sgreatest novelist, Henry James, that he came of age in the midst of acataclysmic Civil War. The great event of the formative decade of Julie deKrüdener’s life was the French Revolution. She was a woman of French languageand French literary culture. Many of her most intimate friends, and most of theauthors whom she admired and imitated, were French. The Revolution dislocatedher life repeatedly, and its entire course was to a large degree determined byits exigencies. Yet there are to be found in her copious correspondencesurprisingly few explicit engagements with the Revolution or any of its possiblelarger meanings.She had arrived in Paris first in the spring of 1789. The day of the attack onthe Bastille, July 14, was baby Julie’s second birthday. Her mother wassurrounded by ominous signs and portents, but if she noted them, she still kepther focus clearly on her literary goals, and thrilled at the chance to sit for afew moments chatting in the pleasant suburban garden of Bernardin deSaint-Pierre. Only two years later, in the spring of 1791, as she passed againthrough Paris with her lover Frégeville, does she seem to have taken fullaccount of a change in the social atmosphere that had already alarmed mostFrench aristocrats, and sent not a few of them into exile. And although Juliefrequently expressed “liberal” ideas and attitudes that showed a degree ofspiritual identification with the lower orders, she was by any standard a memberof the endangered aristocracy. What she saw in Paris at that time encouraged herin her resolve to move on toward Copenhagen.Among those who had taken flight, or had been dispatched toward greater safetyby their parents, was Claude-Hippolyte Terray. In 1790, now sixteen, this youngman whom Julie de Krüdener had met as a child in Lyon was securing a peripateticuniversity education under the guidance of a tutor-companion, M. Petit. YoungTerray had been pursuing his peripatetic education in a nearly indiscriminatefashion, taking up academic residence successively in Edinburgh, London,Hamburg, and Danzig. By early 1793—the year of the high point of the ParisianTerror, we may recall—he had migrated to Leipzig, where there was a growingémigré community. So, as it happened, had Julie de Krüdener. Hippolyte Terraywas now nineteen years old, a young man of noble parts, handsome, chivalrous,athletic, yet a lover of poetry and a reader of La Nouvelle Héloïse and Paul etVirginie.Julie de Krüdener was nearly thirty, at the height of her physical beauty,disillusioned with her marriage, which had long since lost the sexual andemotional adhesive of its earliest years and been transformed into a close butcarefully monitored friendship, hungry for spiritual nutrition, uncertain of herliterary vocation, tardily recognizant of the political whirlwind that had sweptaway the cultural signposts of her intellectual landscape—in short, a womanadrift. Hippolyte had his own rootlessness. Information from or about hisparents in Paris was infrequent and unreliable. He learned that they were beingdetained in one of the revolutionary prisons, the population of which had inSeptember 1792 been reduced by means of mass murder. Aristocratic fantasies of aquick collapse of the Jacobin madness and a return of the old sweet and familiarlife had long since been exposed. It is only superficially surprising that thesetwo would claim the solace of a shared bed.A most revealing letter from Julie de Krüdener was luckily preserved by itspublication in the collected works of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. It is datedfrom Leipzig, February 23. In it Julie announces the reclamation of a long-lostequanimity: “After fourteen months, during most of which time I was sufferingfrom a nervous condition so frightful that my reason was threatened and myhealth reduced to a deplorable state, I recently came back to a colder state ofmind. The fever which was burning in my blood disappeared; my brain is no longeraffected as it previously was; and Hope and Nature have once again descendedupon my soul so tormented by bitter ills and by terrible storms.” She speaksvaguely of the therapeutic agent as “the love of friends,” without going intounnecessary specification.To her husband, now relegated in her mind to the status of wise, old friend notunlike that of the ancient Saint-Pierre himself, she wrote in a confessionalmode so oblique as to be detectable only with the use of powerful opticalinstruments. “I have carved out for myself a kind of solitary existence … I havea house here … I go out in a coach and I frequently see M. Petit and M. Terray,and with them I have enjoyed a happiness that will perhaps be the last of mylife.”Julie and Hippolyte were together for the better part of the year. She had takena private house, which allowed the lovers certain opportunities of discretionand even more for indiscretion. Neither of them could have regarded this asmerely a casual love affair—or even as an “affair” at all. For Julie, certainly,it was a marriage of true minds, perhaps the only kind of marriage a tormentedworld might allow, or her rigorous if socially idiosyncratic ethics mightapprove. Like many other romances born of social upheaval, it was intense and itwas doomed.In the spring of 1794, Hippolyte’s worst fears were realized when he receivednews that his parents had been guillotined in Paris. The charge against them hadbeen aiding and abetting emigration. The French Revolutionary government, likeothers since, was obsessed with dangers posed by the flight of capital and thepossibilities of counter-revolution organized by exiles. Julie’s descendant andhistorian, Francis Ley, indignantly insists that the Terrays were “innocent”;but their son, who was after all living a reasonably comfortable life abroad onthe basis of unclarified financial arrangements, may well have felt a tinge ofguilt as well as the assault of pure horror.Suddenly transformed by an act of tribunal terror from transgressive studentprince into the head of an old, distinguished family with complicated financialbusiness affairs, Hippolyte saw his relationship with Julie in a changedperspective. He still yearned for the fulfillment of their shared dream: alittle cottage in some Swiss glen. But that desire now competed with the morepractical concerns of so many of the émigrés: how would he live, and beyondthat, how might he hope to salvage at least some of the confiscated familywealth, which was considerable? The next few years were overshadowed by theseconcerns.Julie went to Hanover, while Hippolyte went to London, an important center ofémigré banking and brainstorming. When Hippolyte was ready to rejoin her in thespring of 1795, Julie took her mother into her confidence. The mother, thoughconventionally religious, was even more conventionally maternal, and Julie knewshe would have her support. Julie wrote to her of her attachment to “a man ofmerit whose character, whose morals whose tender friendship have not since Ifirst came to know him ceased to confirm for me how I ought to love him. He iswell born, he has a very considerable fortune, shares my manner of feelingconcerning all the essential things, and has demonstrated to me for a long time(during 9 months) how my happiness is precious to him.”Hippolyte returned, and in the summer of 1795 the couple determined to livetogether in Switzerland. Young Terray, ever accompanied by his erudite tutor M.Petit, moved on to Lausanne. Julie returned to the paternal home in Livonia. InApril 1796, she again wrote to her estranged husband asking for a divorce. Thisrequest he deflected as he had deflected all earlier requests, although withoutstrife or unpleasantness. Terray had in the meantime become acquainted withMadame de Staël and the large circle of émigrés within her orbit. The recurrenttopic of conversation among them were certain political developments, the mostimportant of which were typified by the purge of 9 Thermidor, which seemedperhaps propitious to the hopes of the exiles for their safe return to theirnative land.In 1797, Julie became pregnant and gave birth to a son, probably in February1798. Precise dates are lacking. In fact, a great deal is lacking in thedocumentation of this extraordinary episode so rich in its revelations forsocial history. The principals effaced it from public notice so efficiently thatthe very fact of it was revealed in print for the first time only after twocenturies, on the basis of family documents in the possession of Francis Ley.There is not so much as a mention of Terray in the thoroughly researchedbiography by Knapton. There is however the record in the archives of the (RomanCatholic) parish church of Saint-Jean-de-Donaueschingen, of the baptism of amale child named Hippolyte, said to be the son of Hippolyte and Barbara Roschak,both from Vevey in the Vaud in the canton of Berne, and both Calvinists byconfession. Perhaps the idea was that the priest’s delight at bagging a hereticmight allow him not to look too closely into the matter.The unhappy fate of this child, though not directly relevant to the rest ofJulie’s history, gives us further insight into the social history of thosetimes, in which the sexual morals of the earlier Bourbons often ruled privatelife, while the rectitude of Geneva determined the possibilities of the publicresults. Julie turned to her intimate friend Madame Armand, who took the child,now renamed Philippe Hauget, into her household. Ley suggests that the surnamewas a common one in the locality, and hence unlikely to invite notice.The child, who proved to be difficult, was not deprived of a certain degree ofnurturing love. Madame Arnaud was an extraordinary woman and the finest offriends to Julie de Krüdener. But to be cared for as an adopted son is not thesame thing as to be publicly claimed in a society in which so very much dependedon the accident of birth. Julie had been raised in an ambiance in which thelarger social duties came second to none, including the maternal. Her lettersfrom those early years following his birth are replete with coded expressions ofa mother’s love, which were, however, destined always to remain covert.Philippe Hauget, often known by the affectionate nickname of “Lipperet,” becamein time known to his legitimate Krüdener siblings. A few surviving letters showthat his sister Juliette occasionally reached out to him over the years,attempting with as much grace as possible to assure him of her friendly thoughtsand best wishes while still avoiding a public proclamation of intimate kinship.Young Paul de Krüdener, always destined for the diplomatic career that he infact achieved with distinction, was shielded for as long as possible from theguilty knowledge shared by the families’ female members. Only in the 1820s didthe two meet, and then under carefully controlled conditions designed to shieldPaul from any possible embarrassment.In a period as rapidly shifting as that of the French Revolution, circumstancescan change swiftly in a relatively short period of time. In 1793, most Frencharistocrats could desire nothing more fervently than to escape France and theswishing sound of the guillotine’s blade. In 1795, many of those same peoplecould wish for nothing more fervently than the chance to return to France toreclaim their property. Jean-Antoine Terray had had a château nearNogent-sur-Seine. He had a fine town house in Paris.So Hippolyte Terray, the father of Julie’s third child, left. He did not so muchabandon his illegitimate son as simply forget about him. The reclamation of hisfather’s property, which was substantial, became for a while a full-timeoccupation. He continued to proclaim privately noble and honorable intentions toJulie, but she herself was by now moving on. It would be more accurate, perhaps,to say moving back, for she was determined to make a final attempt atreconciliation with her husband. Her motives at this time seem opaque to adistant historical observer, but they clearly included a strain of expiation.The period of intense immersion in literary work, which led to the publicationof Valérie and of her moment of literary fame, was perhaps in part another meansby which she sought some degree of moral recompense for what she now thought ofas her faute—a term suggesting something both of folly and of sin.Julie then entered a period of penitence. Her reaction to the situation appearsto have been religious, though in no very conventional way. Her sin was in herown eyes less clearly vulgar adultery than a transgression against duty. Thelust of the flesh is a comparatively crude and uncomplicated thing whencompared, as it almost always was in the literature of the day, with a morerefined contest between love and duty.“I am more and more decided,” she writes, “to exist no longer for society but toretire to the bosom of my home.…” Thus did she state the concept of a layasceticism that would yet for some time war against her strongly felt emotionaland physical sexuality.Julie Goes to GenevaThe fruits of her moral epiphany were perhaps peculiar. Her growing sense of thevanity of human wishes was ratified in the sterile and shallow lives of theBerlin émigrés. Julie now felt authorized to pursue her dreams—for her,recurrent dreams. One dream was geographical. The landscape for which sheyearned in vacant or in pensive mood was that of the valleys of Switzerland withtheir magnificent and picturesque scenery, their fast-running, crystallinewaters, and their pristine invigorating air, declared by the general Europeanmedical consensus to have nearly magical therapeutic properties. When writing toher mother about her plans to pursue her unconventional union with Terray, shecould praise her lover in no more telling a way than by saying he shared hergeographical enthusiasm: “The fortune of this friend of whom I’m speaking isconsiderable; it is furthermore independent. He has come up with the idea, whichseems so sweet to him, of buying me a nice piece of land in Switzerland. Therethe climate, nature, the sunshine indispensable to my health, and the thousandadvantages smile on me. There I shall be busy, I shall follow my interests, andthe requirements of my health, but I could enjoy none of this if I did not havethe hope of seeing you frequently.”She would now go to Switzerland, to Geneva, liberated both physically andmetaphysically from her marital burden, and there she would pursue her otherimportunate dream, that of literary celebrity. One of her biographers, Knapton,points to the particular importance of this Swiss sojourn from the point of viewof the later historian. Biography is always difficult. It is after all theattempt to represent a human life, and the simplest of human lives lies beyondthe powers of artistic representation. But biography is particularly difficultwhen the chief, or in some instances the only, materials available are thewritings of the subject of the biography. By far the most copious materialsavailable for the life of Julie de Krüdener are her own letters and thosewritten to her. The Geneva sojourn was obviously a turning point in her innerlife, though one could scarcely tell that from her letters. It was in Genevathat she set herself to writing with a purpose.For she had come to Geneva, among other reasons, to reacquaint herself with theFrench literary life she had first experienced a decade earlier at the beginningof the Revolution. At Coppet near Geneva, in its imposing château, Madame deStaël was in residence; and where Madame de Staël was, a certain proportion ofthe elegant arbiters of literary life was bound also to be. Julie de Krüdenernow reentered the “circle” of Madame de Staël, and in doing so she generated auseful body of secondary commentary. For the Coppet period we have not merelyher own letters but others about her.Not surprisingly, the witnesses are not in entire agreement. From Julie’s ownpoint of view, the Swiss rustication was an unblemished idyll of plain livingand high thinking. Those in frequent contact with her at Coppet, on the otherhand, suggest a more complex reality. Madame de Staël herself had a complicatedrelationship with Julie. She liked her, and to a degree admired her; yet shewished no sister too close to the throne, and when Julie became more competitorthan votary, she turned cool. For the present, she was for Julie a font ofencouragement and an influential friend. Of course Julie did not know everythingthat Madame de Staël was saying about her. “I found her distinguished,” Madamede Staël wrote to one of their mutual friends during this period, “but she tellsso many stories of men who have killed themselves for love of her that herconversation gives the impression of being a wager.” Madame de Staël could beformidably acerb, but there is other evidence of Julie’s fascination with herown fatal powers of attraction; and as she lived in a world in which thethinnest of partitions divided provocative flirtation from commonplacesociability, she would have had many opportunities to explore that ethicalborderline. In her most famous novel, the heroine is a femme fatale whollyinnocent of any knowledge of her own fatality. The author herself seems to havebeen not merely aware of it, but happy enough to exploit it. How the morality ofsentiment may have differed in her own mind from the self-indulgences of ennuienjoyed by the Berlin émigrés was perhaps a fine point of casuistry.Madame de Staël had planned to return to Paris before the year (1801) was out,and she now did so, encouraging Julie to follow, and promising to be helpfulwith the publication of her novel in progress. For the situation in the Frenchcapital was considerably changed, and from the point of view of Julie’saristocratic friends, changed for the better. Napoleon as first consul hadseized power two years earlier. The Revolution was officially over. Largenumbers of émigrés had already returned, and more still were returning. Amid allthe uncertainties they carried out their heroic search for equilibrium and thedesperate hope that things might return to “normal”—meaning, of course, the waythey used to be. French literary life would never be exactly as it had beenbefore, but that was not because Madame de Staël and the large group oflittérateurs whom she typified were not willing to try. There was a spiritedattempt, for example, to reanimate the idea of the literary salon, which likemany other social institutions of the Ancient Régime had been eclipsed bypolitics. Literary activity in a new century under a new regime could justly bedescribed as feverish. Madame de Staël’s own huge book, Delphine, was nearlyready for publication.WE LACK PRECISE EVIDENCE concerning the pace of composition of Valérie, butJulie had surely made significant progress on it before she too moved on toParis. She settled into an apartment no great distance from the present site ofthe Madeleine in one direction, or from fame in the other. She arrived,preemptively a literary lion. Madame de Staël, as good as her word, offered herintroductions to the reigning writers of the moment. Chief of these was Réné deChateaubriand, just then enjoying the truly fantastic popular success of hislittle novel Atala, and preparing for his apotheosis with the publication of theGénie du christianisme. Atala (though unfinished) has long been recognized asone of the half dozen most important works of early French Romanticism; itsnatural peers include the likes of Rousseau’s Nouvelle Héloïse andSaint-Pierre’s Paul et Virginie, both of them obvious formative influences onJulie de Krüdener. Atala, set in the North American wilderness, whichChauteaubriand had in fact visited, is a story about missionaries and Indians inwhich the heroes are the missionaries. Though the contest would be close, thispoint of view was perhaps even less politically correct in 1800 than in 2000, asit attacked the Rousseauian idea of the “noble savage” and by extension thepolitico-theological theory behind it, the idea that human ill derives chieflyfrom the corrupting influences of human society.images [../Images/p331.jpg]Julie de Krüdener tried to cultivate René de Chateaubriand, among the mostfamous literary figures of the post-Revolutionary period; but he always kept herat arm’s length. This famous portrait by Anne-Louis Girodet (1804) elicited thefollowing comment from Napoleon Bonaparte: “He looks like a conspirator who’scome down the chimney.”Elsewhere, Chateaubriand’s dissection of the old French society was anything butbloodless. He maintained that the French aristocracy, in which he proudlyclaimed membership with considerable heraldic detail, had gone through threestages: a primacy conspicuous for its ethical superiority; then one lapsed inthe lazy habits of its privilege; and finally an “aristocracy of debauch,” thearistocracy swept away with the Bastille. What validates his credentials as aconservative to be classed with Burke or de Maistre is his championing oftraditional society as a civilizing as opposed to a corrupting force. The greatnurse and preceptor of Europe had been the Christian religion, and to the extentthat Europe might rescue itself from a self-imposed barbarism, it might be soagain. This is the idea that undergirds his great book, part apology, partpoetry, part polemic: Le Génie du christianisme. The word in its title meansboth “Genius” and “Spirit,” and he audaciously expands the idea of“Christianity” far beyond the ecclesial, let alone the mere doctrinal ortheological, to consider sociological, psychological, and aesthetic dimensions.Such ideas obviously have the sharpest possible relevance for the kind ofreligious mission that lay in Julie de Krüdener’s future. But that vocation wasas yet inconceivable. It must lie beyond the publication of Valérie. She wouldhave found in Chateaubriand, at least as she thought, a fellow exile, for nobanished French aristocrat could outdo Julie in the spirit of peregrination. Sheundoubtedly hoped that he might light down upon her web as at least temporarilySaint-Pierre had done earlier. The campaign was to a degree successful.Chateaubriand had considerable influence at the Mercure de France, and he wasinfluential in arranging the publication of Julie’s Penseés d’une dameétrangère.The “thought” or “maxim” was a well-established literary genre in the Old World,and especially in France, the paradise of aphorists. Rapid wit and verbaldexterity had been the coin of the realm both at the Bourbon court and in theliterary salon. But if it was a familiar and approved form, it was no less onein which previous masters had established a very high competitive bar. Julie’slittle apothegms would perforce be vying with those of Voltaire and LaRochefoucauld. Even in this company, Julie could hold her own. The measure ofthe maxim is its brilliance, not its sincerity or spiritual truth; yet some ofJulie’s pensées have a kind of convincing sentimental sweetness about them:“There are women who go through life like springtime breezes, vivifyingeverything which they touch.” She probably thought she knew at least one suchwoman. Others now seem a little trite: “social friendships are like smalldiamonds; they glitter, but are valueless.” Still others walk up to the edge ofbanality, then gracefully leap in: “Life resembles the sea, which owes itsfinest effects to storms.” There is nothing about a box of chocolates.The Pensées was judged a very fine work of its kind. And though it was a slimwork both in size and content, it demonstrated verve and intelligence. Most ofall, it made her a published author. Now she had a public eagerly awaitingValérie.Julie showed every talent for literary politics—for lining up useful sponsors,importuning positive reviews, and the like. Her self-serving adroitness made astriking impression on her biographer Knapton: “The skill which the imaginativeJulie deployed in bringing her wares to the public eye would lead one to believethat her career in the diplomatic world had not been so empty as she usuallyclaimed.” As a matter of fact, the training in the schoolroom of great powerdiplomacy was useful for many aspects of her social life. In a letter to herdaughter Juliette she expressed some shockingly worldly wisdom. “In order tosucceed it is not sufficient to have wit, genius, or good intentions,” shenoted; “everything has its hucksterism.” In the following months Chateaubriandappears very frequently in her letters, and always amid expressions ofadmiration or intimations of his supposed admiration for her. Chateaubriandhimself sought no further intimacy. He was polite, even cordial toward theaspiring authoress, but he kept his counsel. Many years later when she was deadand he was aged, he made a remark that shocked Eynard by its harshness. For itwas Chateaubriand who made the remark with which I began this chapter. He hadknown Julie both in her “worldly phase” and in her “spiritual phase.” Hisconclusion: “She always struck me as icy.”This may have been the sourness of a crusty old man. Such, at least, wasEynard’s opinion: “a naïve and saddened judgment from this man whose sad fate itwas to be wholly dedicated to the contemplation of his own vast and nobleindividuality.”As she moved on with her larger book, Julie de Krüdener met a number of otherliterary notables, including Benjamin Constant. Though her book was notfinished, there was a healthy if entirely uninformed chatter about it. It wouldbe like Richardson’s great novel Pamela and, like its latest competitor, Madamede Staël’s Delphine, an epistolary novel.The Epistolary NovelThe epistolary novel is par excellence a feminine form even when, as is notinfrequently true, the author is a man. Furthermore, the most authentic subjectmatter of the epistolary novel is female passion. Valérie is a special case. Itsauthor is a woman. Its subject is a man—though one thoroughly “feminized” fromthe point of view of sentiment. But its heroine, clearly enough, is the womanwho is the object of his passion and, almost as clearly, a sentimental surrogatefor the author, Julie de Krüdener. To appreciate what was new in Valérienaturally involves some understanding of what was conventional. That involves abrief excursus into the literary history of the epistolary novel.As a genre, the epistolary novel had in the first place several naturalconnections with Enlightenment culture. The Enlightenment had invented neitherthe letter nor the literary letter collection. The literary foundation of theChristian religion was the dossier of the collected letters of St. Paul, whichconsiderably antedate the compilation of the later Gospels. The Fathers of theChurch were looking to other ancient models in the compilation of their lettercollections. Even before Petrarch’s time in the fourteenth century secularwriters had reanimated the epistolary spirit of Cicero. But it was in theEnlightenment period that the letter claimed the practical and culturalimportance it was to enjoy well into the Victorian age, and which it hasdefinitely lost only with the “communications revolution” of the late nineteenthand the twentieth centuries—telegraph, telephone, increasingly rapidintercontinental travel, radio and television broadcasts, electronic mail.The Great Age of the European Letter was probably the period between 1600 and1800. Its Golden Age was the latter half of that period. As we have already seenin relation to the growth of periodical literature, the Age of the Letter hadbeen enabled by its own material revolutions. They have sometimes goneunderappreciated or even unobserved because they were primarily developmentsrather than inventions. These included advances in papermaking that greatlyincreased paper stocks while lowering its price, improved processes for inkproduction, the mass production of quill pens and their artificial surrogates,the development of “penmanship” as a common feature of primary education, andthe relatively cheap manufacture of elegant writing boxes and portable desks.Material innovation can very rapidly lead to observable and sometimes dramaticchanges in social habit that, once established, may seem instantly inevitableand perhaps eternal. Bizet and Puccini cannot have foreseen the day when aritualized plea to silence the cellular phone would be the obligatory overtureto the overture. Letter writing had always had its important social roles, butin this age it became a very widespread cultural habit.There was a democratic element—or at least a democratizing one—to all this. Itwas not just diplomats, bureaucrats, academicians, and political theorists whomight spend a measurable part of each day at their correspondence: reading it,answering it, initiating it. A large section of the upper classes ofEurope—including many people we would be inclined to describe as “middleclass”—became habitual letter writers. One peculiar feature of the letter is itsintrinsically social character. To be sure, just as there is such a thing as“closet drama”—works in theatrical format never actually intended to be stagedin a theater—there is such a thing as the “closet letter.” But for the most partletters, whatever else they might be, were intended to be social communicationand, as we would say, interactive. The poet sitting comfortably by his firesideor shivering in his garret might send a poem into the world with hope; yet itwas hope of a rather abstract and even ethereal kind. The man or woman who senta letter to a relative or a friend had a much more concrete and practical hope:the hope or rather the confident expectation of a reply. That reply, in turn,carried its own confident expectation.Many viewers of Ken Burns’s justly famous television series on The Civil Warhave been struck by one feature of its documentation—namely, the informalletters written by soldiers on either side of the conflict, and generallyaddressed to distant family members at home. Many of these men were privatesoldiers of modest social station and limited formal education, raised on farmsin Indiana or Tennessee. What is likely to seem extraordinary to us is that somany of them wrote with such competence, and often enough with elegance and eveneloquence. It might be possible to draw from this evidence potentially usefultrends for contemporary theorists of American education, but the point here isan historical one. These men were the late inheritors of a culture in whichcompetence in letter writing was among the fundamentals of literacy.Literacy was quite explicitly recognized as an important form of social capital,and like other forms of capital it sought opportunities for its display. Letterwriting was a social art, and just as people eagerly sought instruction in othersocial arts—dancing, for example, or music or fencing—they sought instruction inletter writing. The second half of the seventeenth century in England saw thepublication of a proliferation of letter-writing manuals. These included suchtitles as The Wit’s Academy (1677) and The Young Secretary’s Guide (1687). TheLover’s Secretary, first published at the beginning of the eighteenth century,enjoyed wide popularity in several later editions. The Latin origin of the word“secretary” suggests “private” or “personal” more exactly than it does “secret.”Like many words, it developed in different directions; one strain stressed theprivate, the other the public. Thus “secretary” soon enough came to mean“official,” often enough of high position, as in the secretary of state. Asecretary was first a personal confidant, then one who handled the documentaryside of personal or business relations. Among its expanded meanings, stilloccasionally heard, was a piece of furniture especially designed to be writtenat.The eighteenth century saw the publication of literally dozens of such manualsin all the languages of Europe. Within this group was a prominent subgenredesigned to teach foreigners the conventions of letter writing in French, thelanguage of the international aristocracy.Such books had always been culturally multitasked, so to speak—that is, asked todo more work than met the eye. In the medieval schools, the teaching ofelementary Latin was almost invariably conducted with the use of books intendedto instill the spirit of contemptus mundi (rejection of worldly values) that wasthe ideal of the ascetic communities within which the teaching was done. Astandard primer, an anthology of elementary texts to be mastered by the youngpupils, was called simply the Octo Auctores Morales, the Eight Moral Authors.Ten-year-olds were meant to acquire an enthusiasm for votive chastity at thesame time they picked up the third declension. In the Puritan abecedarium, themnemonic for “A” was our arch-ancestor Adam: “In Adam’s fall we sinned all”—theCalvinist doctrine of the total depravity of man packaged with the first of thevowels.Of course, foundations are laid out to be built upon. The form of the domesticletter could be turned by literary genius to the purposes of art. Some famouswriters of the period are known primarily for their letter writing. That is trueof Madame de Sévigné in the seventeenth century and Mary Wortley Montagu in theeighteenth. The surviving correspondence of some academic and literary figuresmust strike us as enormous. Horace Walpole’s collected correspondence takes up10 fat volumes. It is probably only the amazing copiousness of Voltaire’sliterary production in so many genres that makes us accept with equanimity thefact that the Pléiade edition of his correspondence up to the year 1760 containsroughly 10,000 pages. (There are about 20,000 surviving letters of Voltairealtogether!)Most fiction disputes its own fictionality to some degree. There are of coursemany exceptions in the form of fantasy literature, science fiction, “magical”realism, and so forth. But most fiction is realistic, and what is meant by“realistic fiction” is a narrative that seems as though it might be true, thatpresents experience in a fashion that a reader, perhaps with some effort orColeridgean voluntary suspension of disbelief, can accept as plausible,possible, or even convincing. The epistolary novel often challenges itsfictionality in a particularly aggressive fashion. About a fifth of alleighteenth-century novels were epistolary in form, and many of those includedpseudo-editorial comment asserting that the letters were a genuinecorrespondence among living letter writers, not the made-up invention of afiction writer. There are several examples in which the truth claims have beensufficient to convince some or even most scholarly readers.Julie de Krüdener’s ValérieThe novel Valérie, which appeared in 1803, caused something of a Europeansensation as a history of female passion. It has often been called“autobiographical.” That is because the story it tells has a “real-life”narrative germ. But what made Valérie a sensation was its commitment toimaginary rather than to real life. Its engagement with earlier sentimentalliterature—delicacy forbids the use of the word “imitation” in this regard—alsoplayed a role. In particular its kinship with Goethe’s Sorrows of Young Werther(1774, revised edition 1787), one of the first international best sellers of theAge of Sentiment, is particularly apparent. Even so, the autobiographical germis not without its interest.Shortly after their marriage, the baron was posted to Venice. This cannot havebeen regarded as a hardship post. But the city-state, long in decline from itsRenaissance splendor, must have seemed to the young hyperborean matron a hotbedof southern decadence and, perhaps, possibility. No problem in assessing the“marital phase” of Julie’s life is more opaque than that of her maritalarrangements and her attitude to her husband the baron. It is not clear that sheever invested in her marriage the hopes for a passionate relationship. On theother hand, she had such a well developed sense of dutiful propriety thatordinary categories of marital strife were probably for her unthinkable. “Youknow,” she wrote to Madame de Staël shortly after her estranged husband’s deathin 1802, “that there was nothing in my union with M. de Krüdener than thatfriendship that rules so many marriages in the great world; but I respected him,I valued him, and I believe that I was never so unhappy as in the first weeksafter that terrible loss.” Nonetheless it seems to have been at this quite earlyperiod of her life that Julie transferred her inner hopes for emotionalsatisfaction from her preoccupied husband—from whom she would soon separate onamicable terms—to the world of imagination.So long as he lived, the baron presented also a kind of fixed and necessaryobstacle that would allow if it did not compel her to dramatize to the full theconflicts of a great heart. Thus, when she did fall passionately in love withthe marquis de Frégeville, the drama of the already estranged husband was hardlyless intense than the passion for the lover himself.The brief period of residence in Venice offered Julie experience that, whendilated within the novel Valérie, would make her one of the most celebratedliterary women in Europe. The episode was this. A sensitive and impressionableyouth of the Russian diplomatic corps, Alexander de Stakiev, developed anextravagant crush on the wife of his boss, the ambassador. His passion, of whichJulie de Krüdener was herself entirely ignorant, gnawed at his bosom. Thesituation hovered between the hopeless and the absurd, quite possibly seasonedby the dangerous. Animated by that kind of extravagant and noble virtue to befound everywhere in the pages of pre-Romantic fiction, young Stakiev feltimpelled to withdraw from the situation and return as soon as possible to St.Petersburg. That surely might have been virtue enough, but he supplemented it bywriting the baron a letter in which he explained the situation, offeringsuperfluous praise for the virtue of his wife. The baron, a man of the world,was amused; but he made the mistake of actually showing Julie the letter. She ofcourse had been until that very moment entirely unaware of her fatallyattractive powers; but now that they had been suggested to her, she inwardlyclaimed them in earnest. She began to think of herself as a femme fatale, andthe thinking was the first step toward the being.The plot of Valérie is the imaginary history of what might have happened toyoung Stakiev had he not sensibly faced the moral necessity of returning to St.Petersburg. The Stakiev of the novel is a young man named Gustave de Linar.Gustave is a Scandinavian—a Swede, to be specific. But while his specificScandinavian nationality is perhaps immaterial, his hyperborean passion isessential. Gustave is the personal secretary to a middle-aged count, the husbandof a beautiful child bride, Valérie. The personality of the count is but thinlydeveloped, but he is kindly and admirable, nearly terminally broad-minded, anoble man in his unexciting way, but not one to make a passionate young girl’sheart go pitty-pat. The three are traveling in Italy. Gustave is keeping ajournal, mainly in the form of letters sent home to his friend Ernest de G.Only gradually does Gustave perceive his emotional state, in the discovery ofwhich the novel expends a considerable amount of rhetorical energy. What I meanby “hyperborean passion” is a peculiar form of sentiment, at first geographical.There is something of the young Augustine about Gustave—even before he finds theobject of his passion, passion itself is his object. But there is not much elsethat is Mediterranean in his emotional metabolism. “Ernest, more than ever it isin my heart, that secret agitation which now turns my steps toward the steepsummits of Koullen, and then to our deserted dunes … the loneliness of the seas,their huge silence or their storming rage, the wavering flight of the halcyonbird, the melancholy cry of the bird that loves the frozen regions, the sad,sweet brightness of our northern lights—all this nourishes the indistinct andravishing restlessness of my youth.… Alas! Will I never be loved?”That this is a convincing representation of male sexual desire, evenpre-Romantic or adolescent desire, can be doubted. The theme does, however, findmore or less precise echoes in several of the contemporary writers whom Madamede Krüdener imitates, particularly in Goethe, Jean-Paul Richter, and Mme deStaël. One feature of Valérie is distinctive, however, distinctive and decisive.The tragic Gustave is in this novel so thoroughly feminized that one hardlynotices the book’s lack of a more active heroine. For Valérie, the object ofGustave’s passion, is hardly that—except to the degree that she must be thesource of the images that scintillate in the mirror of Gustave’s mind. Twoepisodes in the novel, regarded as sensational in their day, underscore thetheme of subliminal voyeurism that animates the whole work.The first is “the Dance of the Shawl.” This dance, which has nothing to do withthe more recently invented American Indian ceremonial dance, was a species ofProtestant belly-dancing, if one may make so bold, apparently first performed byEmma Hamilton, Lord Nelson’s friend. (Claims advanced on behalf of the empressJosephine, though discredited, nonetheless suggest its artistic prestige.) LadyHamilton would drape a shawl over her head and hold tight its edges, then strikevarious poses or “attitudes” as she moved gracefully and rhythmically to amusical accompaniment.Literature of the period makes clear that what might be called “chamber dance”was widely regarded as a valuable feminine accomplishment, similar to vocal orinstrumental competence. Julie herself is reported to have won admirers with herrendition of a Cossack dance, an exoticism in the salons of Paris. Theshawl-dance, however, took on a particular cachet.The dance was entirely improvised, having no fixed steps. Indeed, the name“dance” is probably misleading. A better term might be “emotional soliloquy.” Inthe eighteenth letter, the narrator describes a ball given by the Spanishambassador in Venice, a ball to which the most glittering elements of theexpatriate community are invited. The very presence of Valérie so excites thenarrator as to cause a dramatic change in his affect noticed by othermerrymakers.Late in the evening, when some guests have already left, a spontaneous movementarises among those remaining that Valérie should perform the shawl-dance. She issupplicated by many, including her husband and “a woman covered with diamondsand rouge.” After long demurral born of her native modesty, she at last agrees.A certain Lord Méry takes up the violin. Valérie calls for a shawl in bluemuslin, pulls her hair back from her forehead, and puts the shawl over her,allowing its fringes to fall down loosely over the crossed arms. The doors areshut—so that no one might interrupt the performance, which Gustave describes inminute detail, thrilling in its every aspect. His description, like so much elsein the novel, is highly literary. The scene, he says, would appear to have beendesigned by Correggio, but with an assist from the Immortal Bard. “And when sheraised her downcast eyes and her lips formed a smile, one might claim to haveseen there such an image as painted by Shakespeare, Patience smiling at Griefupon a monument.”This is actually a sharp literary allusion to an important scene in TwelfthNight, in which Viola, in male disguise, obliquely announces her love for, andto, Count Orsino, in the form of a fictive history of an invented “sister” whocan love only secretly and from afar. Did she ever announce her love to itsobject? asks the Duke, and Viola replies:A blank, my lord. She never told her love,But let concealment, like a worm i’ the bud,Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,And with a green and yellow melancholyShe sat like Patience on a monument,Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?We men may say more, swear more: but indeedOur shows are more than will, for still we proveMuch in our vows, but little in our love.It is in fact a brilliant use of quotation. For here Gustave has become, as itwere, the disguised Viola. It is Valérie who gives voice, but the words are thesilenced sentiment of the hapless narrator, the protestation of love that he cannever make to its actual object. We have here, in other words, both the sexualand the emotional transformation of the narrator. Shakespeare’s Viola is a womandisguised as a man. Madame de Julie de Krüdener gives us a “disguised” womangiving voice to the inner feelings of the male narrator, Gustave de Linar. Thebeauty, simplicity, and directness of the beshawled Valérie will haunt thenarrator till the end of his days.So haunted is he by his onetime vision of perfection, associated with theexpression of a love that cannot otherwise be expressed, that there is a verymelodramatic reprise of the shawl-dance at another cardinal moment in the novel.Valérie, though by the standards of its age a rather short novel, is nonethelessdistributed into two volumes. The final epistle of the first volume (number 36)is largely given over to a description of a bizarre incident, which takes placeduring a time that the Scandinavian secretary has been left alone while Valérieand her husband are temporarily absent from Venice. Returning one early eveningfrom the island of San Giorgio, Gustave hears as he is walking along theSciavoni a striking female voice singing what he calls an old romance—themeaning of the word here being “love song.” “My ears were surprised by aravishing melody.” What he hears is a song frequently sung by Valérie, and nowapparently sung in Valérie’s own voice.Looking up, Gustave realizes that he is standing before the house of Bianca. Sheis a young woman, living with her aunt, who plays in this novel the role of the“Venetian prostitute” familiar in many late eighteenth-century books. Onesuspects that the author here has in mind various pages in Rousseau’sConfessions in which he relates his encounters with the famously nipplelessbeauty Zulietta (Julietta), or in which he talks of his visits to the woman hecalls the Padoana, whose name was Giustina. Julie de Krüdener, of course, wouldnever descend to Rousseau’s level of frankness; and a certain mystery hoversover the person and position of Bianca. The main thing about her from thenarrative point of view is that upon reflection Gustave realizes that she hasnot merely the voice of his beloved but also, strangely, her nearly exactphysical shape. A plan begins to form in his mind.On another day Gustave proposes to Bianca that they make a kind of promenade bygondola. The conveniently geriatric aunt elects to stay quayside and rest. Outon the water, Gustave is soon overcome by the strangeness of this surrogatepassion which Bianca inspires in him. She of course notices the strange affectof his physiognomy, the literary lover’s pallor traditional since the time ofOvid. It is only natural that she would mistake it as the result of her ownpresence. She reaches out, takes his hand, and asks him, touchingly, “N’avetemai amato?” (“Have you never loved?”) This is a question that echoes the one putto himself by himself in the novel’s very first epistle. Gustave is overcome bythe delicacy of the situation, for he sees that Bianca believes he speaks in anoblique fashion of herself.The author’s narrative response to the difficulty is perhaps maladroit;according to the text, Gustave removes himself to “the extremity of thegondola.” Not surprisingly, Bianca finds this behavior odd. “Siete matto?” sheasks. “Perche non state qui?” (“Are you crazy? Why don’t you stay here?”)Gustave is in fact crazy, as he well knows, crazy with love for Valérie, whichnow overcomes his incipient scruples at the prospect of misleading the youngtart. He asks her to sing a certain romance, the one that he has heard sung byValérie herself: “T’amo più che la vita” (“I love you more than life”). Theintoxicating thrill he experiences through this vicarious music encourages himto his final audacity, certainly one of the sentimental highlights of the novel,and a contender even within the rich competition of pre-Romantic literaturegenerally. He asks Bianca whether on another occasion she would be willing toserve his pleasure. She will be astonished at the form his requestedgratification is to take. He dresses her in the costume he associates withValérie, placing over her head a blue shawl especially purchased for theoccasion. He then asks her to sing, softly, the desired romance: “T’amo più chela vita.” Her compliance with his request carries him to the verge of ecstasy.There is a lengthy literary history on the theme of the artificial, surrogatelover, as in Ovid’s famous story of Pygmalion’s statue of Galatea, or inShakespeare’s reprise of the theme in The Winter’s Tale. Other, more proximatemodels are to be found elsewhere in the period’s fiction. Yet derivative as itis, this scene became, perhaps, the most famous in Julie de Krüdener’s book. Itwas imitated by other authors. At least one romantic song was written about it.It was enacted in amateur dramatics of the drawing room. It has about it asemi-pornographic allure. It is not, however, the kinkiest episode in the novel.That distinction must surely go to Gustave’s obsessive interest in the course ofValérie’s pregnancy and accouchement.The second volume of Valérie is short but action-packed. As it begins, Gustaveis already resigned to death. He informs Ernest, his epistolary sounding board,that he must leave the Count’s household, and he does so precipitously. Heknows, he says, that he will probably write no more letters, but this diagnosisproves to be optimistic. In fact, the concluding section of Julie de Krüdener’sbook is made up of documents of several sorts. Ernest, much alarmed by what hehears from his distant friend, writes directly to Valérie’s husband, the Count,to inform him of his deep worries and to seek counsel. Gustave himself writesdirectly to Valérie only when it has become obvious that his wasting illness hasbeen caused not by some distant Scandinavian beauty—a white lie in which he hasconnived—but by herself. There are several letters from the Count himself, whoexhibits a greatness of soul unblemished by the slightest annoyance at his youngemployee’s passion for his young wife. In one intriguing section we get episodesfrom the journal of Gustave’s mother in Sweden, beginning with an event thatoccurred on his second birthday. The burden of all these documents is to recountthe inevitable but supremely Romantic depth of a young man overwhelmed by apassion forbidden him by virtue.One of the odder gestures of pre-Romanticism was what might be called thethematic eroticization of Christian asceticism. In the eighteenth century, thiswas reflected in the popularity of the legend of “Abelard and Héloïse,” taken upby Pope among others. It had been greatly enhanced by some beautiful pages inthe Génie du christianisme of Réné de Chateaubriand, Julie de Krüdener’sambivalent friend and admirer.It is not entirely surprising, therefore, that Gustave’s last breaths should betaken in a semi-ecclesiastical setting. To escape the physical presence ofValérie he flees westward into Lombardy, described from his Venetian perspectiveas “the land of the setting sun.” In a small village in the shadow of amonastery the hapless lover is overtaken by a fatal malady, vaguely pulmonary innature, which he realizes is carrying him away. He engages an invalid’s room ina hostel. At this point the Count himself intervenes, having had an epistolaryalert from Ernest, and he goes to be by his young secretary’s bedside.The protracted death of Gustave, the rhetorical and emotional climax of thenovel, was widely appreciated by its readers as a masterpiece of the highestsentiment. Once again, it is explicitly “literary” to a very remarkable degree.Seeing some books on the stand next to Gustave’s deathbed, the Count inquireswhether Gustave would like to hear something read to him. “Something inEnglish,” is the reply; and the Count reaches out for a copy of Thomson’sSeasons, opening it at random to some lines near the end of “Spring”:But happy they! the happiest of their kind!Whom gentler stars unite, and in one fateTheir hearts, their fortunes, and their beings blend.‘Tis not the coarser tie of human laws,Unnatural oft, and foreign to the mind,That binds their peace but harmony itself,Attuning all their passions into love;Where friendship full-exerts her softest power,Perfect esteem enlivened by desire …The whole scene is imitated after Goethe’s Werther, in which the RomanticScottish author of choice is, however, “Ossian,” not James Thomson. But thelines cited are among the most famous lines in this most famous poem, a poemread in its age by anyone who read poetry at all. The chances of coming uponthem in the random opening of a volume today approximate those of winning theIrish Sweepstakes. They include an expression of the highest of Romantic love,Perfect esteem enlivened by desire, an ideal unrealized in the marriage of Juliede Krüdener no less than in that of Valérie herself. As for Gustave, the“perfect esteem” without a licit channel of desire proves to be fatal. At thevery end Gustave receives the religious ministrations of a French priest, anorphan of the Revolution, who has found asylum in the Ultramontane monastery. Inour more ecumenical age the episode is marked by a strain of doubtlessunintended levity, for the priest makes heavy weather of the fact that Gustave,whom he has seen at mass, apparently in fervent prayer, is not in fact a RomanCatholic. He is, however, one of the great saints of sentiment and martyrs oflove.The rigid limitation of the epistolary novel inspired imaginative authorialattempts to say things that letters could not credibly say. Valérie ends withsome supposed pages from the journal of Gustave’s mother who, as she viewed thecorpse of her beloved son within his coffin, was struck by seeing a ring uponhis finger. “He had on one of his fingers a ring decorated, as is our nationalcustom, with his heraldic arms. I wanted to remove it from him. Then,remembering that he was the last shoot of that illustrious House of Linar, Isaid, ‘Stay, go with him into the tomb.’ Then my tears flowed. I put the handback upon the dead body, and I closed the coffin.”THE PUBLICATION OF VALÉRIE created a sensation. Overnight, Julie de Krüdener wasacknowledged one of the great writers of the age, claiming her rightful placeamong her inspirers, her friends, and her peers: the Rousseau of La NouvelleHéloïse, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Madame de Staël, Réné de Chataubriand. Wemay call this constellation of writers the birth of Romanticism if we wish. Theywere also the harvesters of Enlightenment. As for Julie de Krüdener, she hadachieved literary fame just in time to realize she wanted something else.BibliographicalJulie de Krüdener presents a bibliographical challenge in two respects. Thefirst difficulty lies in the fact that the primary sources for her biography,her abundant correspondence, has not been collected and edited. Any fullassessment of her life and work must await that achievement. The seconddifficulty is that so much of the scholarship devoted to her has been implicitlyor explicitly partisan.To begin with, there is the excellent biography in English by Ernest JohnKnapton: The Lady of the Holy Alliance, the Life of Julie de Krüdener (New York,1939). Knapton was a literary scholar with a deep knowledge of French and Germanpre-Romanticism, and he does a very good job of maintaining balance. This worksupplanted Clarence Post’s The Life and Letters of Madame de Krudener (London,1893); but Post’s book is still valuable for its collection of Julie’s lettersin translation.Julie’s first serious French biographer was Charles Eynard, Vie de Madame deKrudener, 2 vols. (Paris, 1849). This remains the most valuable collection ofher published writings. But Eynard was a very religious man, writing from thepoint of view of a hagiographer. For him the most important thing about hissubject was her religious conversion, and he made little attempt (beyondcondemnation) to deal with her early “worldly” life. One finds a nearly oppositeimpulse in E. Muhlenbeck’s late nineteenth-century Étude sur les origines de laSainte-Alliance (Paris & Strasbourg, n.d.), a rare book that has someinformation nowhere else available. The author was an Alsatian antiquarian whohad contact with several people who had actually known his subject. ButMuhlenbeck’s secular and anti-clerical spirit made it impossible for him tosympathize with Julie’s religious ideas. So, one of her nineteenth-centurybiographers presented her as saintly, and the other as merely kooky.The most important work on Julie de Krüdener is undoubtedly Francis Ley’s Madamede Krüdener et son temps 1764–1824 (Paris, 1961). Ley was a direct linealdescendant of Julie, and he had access to papers never before made public. Hisbig book naturally made a significant advance in the knowledge of its subject.For example, Ley was the first to reveal the episode of Julie’s illegitimate son(see La Revue de Paris [1965]: 130–42)—an episode so well hushed up that it hadremarkably escaped all previous scholars and even, apparently, oral familyhistory. Ley accomplished other important work, including the anthology ofletters involving Julie’s circle awkwardly entitled Bernardin de Saint-Pierre,Madame de Staël, Chateaubriand, Benjamin Constant, et Madame de Krüdener (Paris,1967).No manuscript of Julie’s famous novel Valérie has been found, but there is amodern scholarly edition with a good introduction by Michel Mercier (Paris,1974).

Rosmaster the Younger. This etching, or one similar, became themodel for a once popular subject of shell cameos.9 Julie de Krüdener Dévote [../Text/content.xhtml#ch9]WHILE JULIE HAD BEEN pursuing and gaining fame, she herself had been beingpursued, at times unaware, by a spiritual destiny. As her spiritual“development” was not always linear, it is useful to backtrack over certainpersonal highlights of the years 1800–1804. The appropriate tempo for religiousconversions, according to most of the literary classics of the genre, should bethe instantaneous, the scriptural model for Christian conversion being literallythe blinding flash on the road to Damascus that transformed Saul of Tarsus intoPaul the Apostle to the Nations. Augustine, too, the greatest exemplar insecular letters, represents his moment of conversion as happening in oneserendipitous moment as he sat beneath a fig tree. Yet even in writing aboutthat decisive instant, after which his life would never be the same, he makesthe reader aware of the long and agonizing anterior thought devoted to whatexactly it was that he might be converted to. Julie’s “religiosity,” thoughoften treated as the aftermath of a single grace-filled moment, was obviously agradual process.The household of her childhood had been both religious and enlightened. Hermother was a serious Protestant who practiced her faith, externally, in theforms approved by the Lutheran churches of the German-speaking states. Theseincluded, in addition to regular Sunday worship, daily household prayers forfamily and an extensive domestic staff. Her father, though a conventionalreligious conformist, was not conspicuously devout; he seems to have found hisprincipal spiritual nourishment at a Masonic Lodge frequented by men well readin science and philosophy. All around her in Riga lay a rich religious diversitytouched upon earlier. So Julie de Krüdener was, and undoubtedly regarded herselfto be, a Christian among Christians, within a context in which that was thegeneral or default social expectation. There is no evidence of an unusual earlypiety. The adjective she used of herself, and that was used of her by some earlyliterary associates, was mondaine: worldly, secular.Historians sometimes have difficulty with the religious dimension of theirbiographical subjects because they approach religion primarily from the point ofview of belief. What did they believe, and when? What did they doubt, and why?Questions of agnosticism and atheism in the Enlightenment period—when they wereusually classified under the name of “infidelity”—certainly command ourinterest. No less interesting, however, are the evidences of religion’s socialroles, both in terms of community formation and as an impetus to social action.Julie’s training in the literary school of sentiment (feeling) undoubtedlyhelped prepare her for that inner light and tutelage of the heart that was tobecome the mystical center of her being.There is even in her pre-conversion personality a streak of proto-evangelism.This is typified in a letter published by Eynard (I, 94) without date in whichshe attempts to console Madame Armand, recently taxed with “painful trials” ofunspecified character. “Yes, my friend,” she writes, “count always onProvidence! She exists, she will bless you, you are her dear child.… Courage,dear Armand, courage! Happiness is far from luxury and high station!” Suchadvice given to the adoptive mother of her own “sin-child” from a woman who evenas she wrote it was lusting after the literary fame of the old Parisian salons,may strike us as a bit thick, especially as she goes on to a decidedlyegocentric encomium of the consolations of religion. “Oh! Thank heaven forhaving given me religion. Without it my character, which now takes refuge inmelancholy, would become black, hateful, perhaps as miserable as those whoinspire in me disdain for their levity.” In other words: thank God I am not likethose Pharisees! This strain in her religious physiognomy, which thehagiographer Eynard regarded as a striking evidence of the egotistic “before”that would be divinely transformed into a self-sacrificial “after,” and whichher biographical detractors regarded simply as mawkish sentimentality, did laterprove to be a foundation on which something new could be built.At the same time she was discovering what later theologians would come to callthe “social gospel.” She was particularly fond of the large family estate atKosse, in Livonia, for as a child she had been introduced to the wonders ofNature and to the attractive aspects of peasant culture. When at a certain pointKosse became her personal property, she immediately interested herself in theconditions of the tenant farmers, and of the local population of agriculturalworkers generally. She directly confronted the unwavering and to her mind unitedconservatism of the property-owning classes, whose enmity she soon attractedwith various idealistic plans for the amelioration of peasant welfare. Herfactual situation was strikingly similar to the fictional one of Dorothea Brookein George Eliot’s Middlemarch. The determined resistance by many landowners toany program of social amelioration for agricultural tenants shocked her, and ledher to sympathize with those Russian reformers, including especially in her mindthe emperor Alexander I, who had become czar in 1801, and who faced theopposition of ignorant, black reaction.In those years before her dramatic conversion she rarely spoke of God. Herpreferred term, shared by so many in the eighteenth century, was “Providence.”We find her writing thus in one of her letters to Jean-Paul (Richter): “I thankProvidence for this heart [she speaks of her own] full of confidence. But whatelse does it do but dream? Where is its energy? Where are the deeds which wouldraise me in my own estimation?” At this point in her life the “deeds” she had inmind were perhaps the achievement of literary works that might bring her fame.But even then she showed an increasing appetite for those social “good works”that in Catholic countries were the hallmarks of the so-called dévotes or deeplyreligious lay women, the heiresses of the likes of Madame de Chantal, whoseinspiration gave birth to a dozen new socially oriented religious orders. In oneof her letters she describes what was in effect a slum-crawling expedition withher children in Teplitz, Bohemia. “We stopped in a narrow street and went up toa gloomy and dirty chamber. The woman was seriously ill, and her husband,although evidently strong, seemed to be overwhelmed. I poured a few crowns whichwe had gathered together into his wife’s apron. My children spoke to her in asympathetic manner, full of compassion. What a charming expression came in theirpretty faces!”Conversion as RebellionAn aspect of religious conversion seldom considered was its potential for socialdisruption, even revolution. The old meaning of the word “conversion” was notwhat it is today. In the centuries of a thoroughly Christianized Europe such aconversion as that of Augustine, a conversion from paganism to Christianity, wasa historical and literary memory. What conversion usually meant even in earlymodern Europe was the well-considered entry into ascetic life. The conversusformally embraced the so-called contemptus mundi, a Latin phrase meaningliterally the “despite of the world,” and figuratively the abandonment of allworldly values. The ascetic vows of religion, which in the Roman Church had longsince become at least the ostensible burden of all clerics, formally abjured allgratifications of material wealth, political power, and sexual satisfaction—thatis, the engines that drive most of what we call “real life.”Such radical constraints on human behavior often had social implications thatwent far beyond the individual. In a society in which the maintenance of familyproperty might be a preeminent consideration, the perceived threat to thepreservation of familial assets was grave indeed. Religious life offered auseful asylum for many young people otherwise inconvenient to their families.But for an elder son, let alone an only son, to undergo “conversion” was acatastrophe not cheerfully to be accepted. In his Chronicles, the earlyFranciscan historian Salimbene di Adam gives us an anecdote concerning his ownacceptance of the Franciscan habit. Members of his family accompanied by armedknights surrounded the little religious house in which he had taken upresidence. They demanded his return; the friars refused. There was a standoff,threatening at any moment to descend into bloodshed, as his relatives loudlyberated him for betraying family duty, and while the friars shouted outencouraging (not to mention infuriating) scriptural passages, such as: “Anyonewho loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.” Versions of thispattern of family strife, though seldom so poetically exemplified, were verycommon in Catholic Europe down to the time of the French Revolution.Religion had its place, and irreligion was a serious threat to society,vigorously repressed. But as episodes of social history in premodern Europerepeatedly demonstrate, religion taken too seriously might be a threat hardlyless alarming. Of this truth the historical exemplifications are many andnotorious. King Henry appointed his friend Thomas as archbishop of Canterbury inthe wholly reasonable expectation that Thomas would demonstrate his gratitudefor preferment by honoring his royal patron’s expectations concerning variousmatters ecclesial. The rest is, as we say, history. Much closer to the materialsdealt with in this book is the career of the reforming abbess Mère AngéliqueArnauld. She became head of the famous Jansenist religious house of Port-Royalas a child of eleven—a fact that might well suggest the distance that the socialreality of “religious life” could stray from its ascetic theory. When Carlyle inhis Past and Present chose a subject typifying the dynamic pattern of leadershiplacking in the England of his day, he found it in the story of a reformingmedieval abbot who had taken religion far too seriously for the comfort of hiscomfortable monks.Jean-PaulSome sense of the compartmentalized nature of Julie de Krüdener’s life duringthe final years of the eighteenth century should be clear from the narrative sofar. She led an extraordinarily peripatetic life, circling and recircling inwide arcs among the cities from Lausanne to St. Petersburg. Her extensivetravels were only partially required by her social exigencies, and whether theywere more cause or effect of the compartmentalization would be difficult to say.Lacking a full edition of her collected letters—a scholarly desideratum thatmight bring fame as well as pleasure to an archivally minded social historian—itis very difficult to get a full, coherent, and sequential command of herphysical movements, let alone her intellectual and spiritual ones.It seems clear that her residence in Berlin brought certain finalities that, ifthey did nothing else, cleared the path ahead. It is from this time, in thefirst place, that her letters begin to be filled with an ascetically tingedworld-weariness. Berlin was full of deracinated French aristocrats, who tendedoften to behave in the manner of other expatriate lost generations. She wasgenuinely shocked by the openness and coarseness of the hedonism, which oftenscoffed at even the pretense of high ethical justification, and which from thepoint of view of sensibility was woefully lacking. Though she remainedself-absorbed to a fault, she seems to have constructed no mental parallelbetween her own rootlessness and the frantic anomie she found about her on everyside. Indeed, it is the combination of her acute analysis of the moral vacuityof the social scene in Berlin with her own apparent superficiality concerningher own spiritual condition that has given ammunition to her unfriendlybiographers. Nonetheless, in retrospect, leaving Berlin would be the first stepin a journey that took her far away from her old life.Also, she did now resolve, finally and definitively, that her marriage with thebaron de Krüdener had ended. Unfortunately, she did not at first tell himexactly that in so many words. This time the pretext for continued separation,recognized as such by the baron, was her health. Though not yet forty years oldshe suffered with rheumatism, and her doctors counseled—as they usually could berelied upon to do—“the waters.” One of her favorite watering places was Teplitz,a Bohemian spa now in the Czech Republic, and she determined to return there. AtTeplitz she was with old friends, especially the princesses Radziwill andGalinsky. Social frivolity comes in different strengths or proofs, and that ofTeplitz seemed to her desirable. It would take one more “delay” to convince thebaron of the finality of the truth. She wrote to him saying that her health nowrequired her to remove to Switzerland. The baron’s reply to the situation is animpressive monument to a certain species of moral nobility. He accepted thesituation. What else could he do? He did allow himself a few words of chiding:“As you had definitively made up your mind to leave my house, why did you notinform me of your intention previous to your departure?” But it was a rhetoricalquestion, not an invitation to a continuing correspondence; and his last knownwords to her, with which his dignified letter ends, plead that she shouldbelieve him “heart and soul your sincere and devoted friend.”TRUTH, WE KNOW, IS the daughter of time; but time has several less prestigioussisters, including among them literary fame. Some historical phenomena require acertain amplitude of time to work themselves out. When asked what he thoughtwere the chief results of the French Revolution, Zhou Enlai (or any one of anumber of people to whom dubious but desirable quotations are attributed)remarked that it was too soon to tell. True literary fame requires stayingpower, the approbation of two or three generations at the very least. This iswhy the phrase “once popular” is among the cruelest in the vocabulary ofliterary history. But the literary supernova, though particularly characteristicof our own age, has existed as long as literary reputation has been recorded.One of the great literary superstars of Julie’s time was her nearly exactcontemporary Jean-Paul.This man was a Bavarian, whose real name was Johann Paul Friedrich Richter(1763–1825). He took up its abbreviated French version in obvious homage to thesuperstardom of his Romantic hero, Jean-Jacques (Rousseau), and in deference tothe reigning claims of French literary culture. He was, however, a German whowrote in the German language, and wrote so prolifically that the first editionof his collected works ran to some sixty volumes. His fiction was highlyeccentric both in form and content, but its demonstrations of offbeat erudition,philosophical speculation, and often broad comedy attracted an enthusiasticfollowing. He began writing seriously in the 1790s, and his novel Hesperus(1795) clinched his fame.Enlightenment developments in science and philosophy had established in bothFrance and England the prestige of the German language. It was in this contextthat Madame de Staël had thought it timely to introduce the French province ofthe Republic of Letters to German literature. Julie de Krüdener had theconsiderable cultural advantage of having a perfect command of that literature,in which she had read widely. (Her written German was, as she well knew, clumsyand inelegant, as all her writing training had been in French.) Jean-Paul wasnot exactly a Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, but he was a rising star with interests(the supernatural adumbrations to be found in the world of Nature, for example)of special appeal to Julie’s own sensibility. It was only natural that theaspirant would seek out the newly minted master as soon as opportunity presenteditself.The opportunity came in the summer of 1796, during one of her recurrentperipatetic episodes while she was still trying to hold together herrelationship with Hippolyte Terray. She had returned for a second sojourn atLeipzig. Jean-Paul had at that time made a romantic flight to the soothingisolation of the countryside not too far from Leipzig in a beautiful placecalled Hof. This was one of the more widely advertised rustications sincePetrarch took up residence at the Fontaine de Vaucluse. There in an elegantpeasant’s hut Jean-Paul, who had already been accorded the sobriquet “Jean-Paulthe incomparable,” received a stream of admiring visitors, many of them women,and not a few like Julie de Krüdener, young and beautiful women.Ernest Knapton, who was the first to realize the thematic significance ofJulie’s friendship with Jean-Paul, has documented it in detail. Both of them, indiffering styles, were outrageous flirts. Jean-Paul was one of those writers whowrite down nearly everything, and one of the things that had passed through hisyouthful mind was a burlesque version of the “questions” set for essaycompetitions and entrance examinations. “Prize question for the Erotic Academy:How far may friendship toward women go, and what is the difference between itand love?” They both had their roles to play. Julie was that kind of womanattracted to ugly men of talent; Jean-Paul was that kind of man attracted totalented women of beauty. This proved to be a satisfactory basis foracquaintanceship and a brief exchange of letters.Jean-Paul had written almost gushingly to his intimate friend Christian Otto,describing Julie as a creature semi-divine. The only sublunary analogies hefound appropriate came from the field of sacred art. Julie recalled for him thebeauty of a Madonna or a Mater Dolorosa. To Julie herself, with whom heinitiated a correspondence, he was scarcely less extravagant. “You came like adream, you went like a dream, and I am still living in a dream.”In her reply Julie kept up the beat. “You also will be unforgettable to me, morefrom what I saw and from what I felt as I looked at you than from what I read onthose occasions when I was struck by deep emotion by your works.” But of courseshe had read the works, and was not chary of giving her opinion of them; but itwas the work that was the man himself that had captivated her.She wrote in response: “I can never forget those hours when your eyes, the soundof your voice, the indescribable whole of your emotions as revealed through yourexpression and accent conveyed me to the sweetest of harmonies—I mean, reasoncombined with emotion.”That final phrase merits a reflective pause. Knapton was concerned to bring outthe element of sentiment in Julie de Krüdener especially in the early andliterary phases of her life, including conspicuously her pursuit of famousliterary figures like Bernardin de Saint-Pierre and Jean-Paul. It was theelement of sentimentality, an element impossible to ignore but perhaps not soeasy to assess justly, that made him want to stress her Romanticism. Theassumption here is that sentiment marks a sharp departure from the centralintellectual concerns of the Enlightenment.A moment’s reflection will reveal the inadequacy of a formulation that wouldbanish Rousseau, Diderot, and even Baron Grimm from the fame of Enlightenment.In fact, what Julie de Krüdener says comes strikingly close to Wordsworth’scelebrated definition of poetry in the preface to the Lyrical Ballads: “I havesaid that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes itsorigin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the emotion is contemplatedtill by a species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears, and anemotion, kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation, isgradually produced, and does itself actually exist in the mind.” But verysignificantly the word used by Julie de Krüdener is not “tranquillity”; it is“reason.” The difference, which may seem subtle, is not without its importance.Kant had said that it was the peculiar feature of the human mind to set itselfproblems which it was incapable of solving. For Julie de Krüdener and manyothers of the “sentimental” school, emotion was not the enemy of reason, but itspartner or handmaiden.Julie and Jean-Paul met several times more over the next few years, but therewere limits even to his protean energies, the genuinely erotic elements of whichwere increasingly monopolized by the pursuit of his future wife, Caroline Meyer.Julie felt strangely authorized to unburden herself to him as though he were themost intimate of friends, often enough with a whiff of ethical blackmail. “I amone of those silent and obscure souls who love your splendor,” she writes, “notbecause its luster throws light upon them, no! But because it is beneficial forthe general good and for humanity. My soul loves your worth.” A man likeJean-Paul Richter at a time like that could easily be expected to write a dozenor more letters a day—that in addition to all the “real” writing, holding court,and frank socializing that might be required of him. These were obligations thatmight impose upon him the necessity of a kind of epistolary triage, and he letthe correspondence lapse.It is probably for this reason that Richter’s importance in the formation ofJulie de Krüdener’s self-image has been insufficiently explored. He wasimportant to her in many ways, beginning with her literary scalp-hunting. Theircorrespondence, intermittent and even perfunctory as it may have been, gave heranother scalp for her collection. But Jean-Paul’s handling of religious topics,which he frequently addressed in picturesque and sentimental fashion, made thesearch for transcendence an aspect of his appreciation of Nature. This seems tohave been very much on Julie’s wavelength. Further, Jean-Paul had had a soberingexperience just about the time of his first great “worldly” success withHesperus, of which he frequently spoke. He had had some kind of vision of hisown death, which while not exactly like that effected under similarcircumstances to Dickens’s Scrooge, had dramatically ethicized if nottheologized his conception of his literary vocation. Julie de Krüdener would indue course have a similar moment of ethical clarification at which her lifelongyearning for literary fame would be to her as the sounds of lyres and flutes.But before she despises the fame, she must first achieve it.During these years, as we have already seen, Julie de Krüdener was on the sideconducting the great love affair of her life, giving birth to a bastard son andarranging with unhesitating worldly wisdom for his social concealment, andtrying—endlessly, as it seemed—to break free from a marriage from which sheappeared to have broken free on at least three previous occasions. She movedabout the German cities a good deal and had another stay in Lausanne. Her socialcommunity seemed usually to center among the French émigrés, some of whom, onaccount of marriage, business arrangements, or disasters back in France, hadmore or less happily become permanent expatriates.An obviously orchestrated silence hovers over the end of the relationship withHippolyte Terray. It seems to have been effected without undue emotion, andcertainly without public displays of any sort. There were still plenty of men inJulie’s life, but they tended toward the elderly, the philosophical, and theclerical. Two appear to have been influential in the tolerant and ecumenicalstructuring of her developing religious vision. During a visit to Munich she hadbecome acquainted with an erudite Catholic priest, the abbé Becker. She greatlyadmired this man, who became for her a kind of extra-ecclesial guru; but hedied, suddenly, while their intellectual intimacy was still in its infancy. Thesecond was Ludwig Ernst von Borowski, whom she encountered at Königsberg.Borowski was one of the most prominent exponents of orthodox Lutheranism aroundthe turn of the nineteenth century. He was also something of a model of the“society cleric” prominent in the realistic fiction of the period. Aconsiderable correspondence between these two friends survives, and from it isapparent that Borowski took Julie to be a woman of marked intellectual abilityand unusual spiritual capacity.For several years Julie had lived with the considerable tension of having a deadmarriage and a living husband. Her inner deliberations concerning maritalreconciliation, however intermittent or self-deceiving, finally came to an endwhen her husband died on June 14, 1802. She was by then well along with Valérie.When the news reached her, she grieved sincerely for the loss of her “dearestfriend.” But she must have experienced also a sense of liberation. She was nowfree to become famous; but there is evidence that she already regarded fame’sachievement with a strange ambivalence.Seeking New Life: The PietistsIn the spring of 1804 Julie de Krüdener, now a woman of forty, returned to thefamily home in Riga. A great deal had happened since she set out in naïveté orinnocence as a young bride of eighteen. She was now a widow, and fatherless. Hermother was still living, indeed living in good health, but beyond purely localand familial topics the two women no longer had much in common. She had beenmade famous by her book Valérie, but the brief glister of her literary celebritynow seemed increasingly dim. Her letters from this period reveal a generalspiritual unease falling between ennui and anxiety. She had in effect become astranger in her own hyperborean land, the supposed landscape of her exquisitesensibility. In point of fact there were important cultural and intellectualresources available in Riga, but they were academic and Masonic. There wasnothing in her native capital that to her mind might approach a Parisianliterary salon. Most of all, perhaps, she suffered from the loneliness she hadso poignantly recorded in the diary of her early married life.In his classic Varieties of Religious Experience, William James describes thegeneral feeling of malaise that often was a prelude to dramatic religiousconversion. Many converts, famously including St. Augustine in his Confessions,actually spoke of this state in the language of pathology. This was also thecontrolling trope of the Consolation of Philosophy, a classic of the earlyMiddle Ages still read by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. That is, thesoul on the threshold of conversion often perceives its own sickness and, yetmore terrible, its inability to heal itself. Julie cast about in search ofpurpose and for a time entertained the possibility of a new writing project. Shehad a somewhat vague idea for a book to be called The Peoples of the World,hardly a modest topic, nor one easily achieved. We may doubt that it was evermuch more than a pipe dream, but it provided the occasion for her to offer somehighly interesting remarks about Valérie. The new book would be, she wrote, “thecontrary of Valérie. I think this work will be extremely moral: the great numberof truths that I have collected, and the great number of wealthy people whomI’ve seen to be unhappy, will give me a thousand inexhaustible topics from whichI can draw moral lessons.”As she had always firmly defended the moral nature of her novel, her remarkshere may be rather puzzling. One can easily enough attack the artistry ofValérie or its implicit social values; but its morality would seem to beunexceptional. Indeed, from the conventional point of view, all the charactersin Valérie are “moral” to a fault. The most plausible conclusion one can drawfrom her remark is that she now regarded the very stuff of romantic love, whichis to say the central material of European fiction, as a false and “worldly”goal, incapable of providing the happiness so eagerly sought by the soul. “Thouhast made us for thyself, and our heart is restless ’til it find its rest inThee.” She had made an exchange of ethical banalities from “Love makes the worldgo round” to “Money cannot buy happiness.”There was a precipitating event. One day as she sat or stood at a window facingthe public street, idly watching the activity below, a man, an acquaintance ofhers, was passing by below. Their eyes met momentarily, and the man tipped hishat or made some other sign of friendly recognition. Within an instant, within afew steps, while she still had her eyes upon the walking figure, the man droppeddead or dying in the street, struck down by a cerebral occlusion or a heartattack. The empirical experience of the impermanence of human life and thepossibility of its abrupt annihilation is one that many people have had, thoughseldom in so stark a form, and the experience is a natural invitation to somberreflection by even the most slow-witted. The world is surely a most unstable or“tikel” place, muses the old carpenter in Chaucer’s “Miller’s Tale”:I saw today a cors yborn to chircheThat now, on Monday last, I saugh hym wirche.Julie de Krüdener, impelled by this accidental and catalytic intimacy withmortality, now appears to have directed the laser beam of her exquisitesensibility toward the novissimi, the “Last Things” of Christian theology:Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell.The carrot and the stick of the old religion were the hope of heaven and thefear of hell. They had been the motivating forces behind medieval religiouspractice, of which a good deal remained, even in Protestant countries, throughthe time of the Enlightenment. It is perhaps a testimony to the sweetness ofJulie’s personality that the religious views she now began to espouse withfervor were positive and optimistic—at least for the moment. The realignment ofher ideas had cheerfully centered on the meaning of happiness. She had spent herentire life wanting to be happy; she continued to want to be happy now. So, forher, religious conversion did not mean the adoption of ascetic attitudes thatimplied the postponement of all gratification to some supposed future state. Itmeant, instead, a redefinition of happiness itself. Happiness as an abstractionwas the quality possessed by happy people. From her new perspective, theglittering world of famous writers and the scintillating salon, the goal forwhich she had yearned and which she had so surprisingly achieved, was not aworld of happy people. Happy people were to be found elsewhere, such as in thecottages of peasants or the workshops of modest artisans. This is after all whatRousseau and Bernardin de Saint-Pierre had taught.Of course very few religious conversions are in fact as instantaneous aspresented by those who experience them and who perhaps unconsciously invest themwith a narrative drama their personal significance seems to demand. Religion,and religious practice, had never been entirely absent from Julie’s life. Yet itis difficult to map out the contours of her spiritual life in the pre-conversionperiod. Patterns of allusion in her letters give clear evidence of herfamiliarity with the Bible, and especially with the Gospels. This was probablygained less from systematic Bible-reading than from repeatedly hearing thereading of the assigned pericopes in regularly attended church services.Evidence suggests, however, that Julie’s conversion was primarily “social,”having been effected through personal contacts with certain individuals whoshattered her received sense of human happiness: Pietists.MUHLENBECK, THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY ANTI-CLERICAL local historian of Alsatianantiquities, began his indispensable (but nearly unfindable) book A Study of theOrigins of the Holy Alliance with an arresting declaration: “The heroes of thishistory were all Pietists and Chiliasts.” But he says as well that their worldis “today” so little known as to require a goodly amount of preliminaryexplication. As Muhlenbeck wrote around 1870, hardly half a century removed fromthat world, for us the need for some background is more pressing yet. We mustwait a moment for the chiliasts; but who were the Pietists? Muhlenbeck’s owndefinition of them is hardly dispassionate. They are “the Pharisees ofProtestantism, people who live apart from other Christians and are ceaselesslyoccupied with devotional reading, pious exercises, and complaints against allthose who are not of their coterie.”Pietism was not a church, but a movement or a tendency. The elements of the word“religion” (literally, a “re-tying”) point to a concept of the recreation of aonce broken connection with God. The thirst for direct experience of God hadbeen the motive, at least at a theoretical level, of traditional Christianascetic life. It animated many of the great Reformers as well. They longed forecclesial structures that encouraged a direct access to the divine; but in noneof the major centers of official Protestantism (German-speaking Lutheranism,French-speaking Calvinism, English-speaking Anglicanism) were the resultssatisfactory to all the believers. In this context, Pietism might be regarded asa second wave of the Reform within German Protestantism.It had no generally recognized leader, but historians have been eager to supplyit with a “founder”—the Lutheran theologian Philipp Jacob Spener (1635–1705).Spener, a great preacher, enunciated certain principles that became the essenceof Pietism. He placed a primary emphasis on the laity. Luther himself hadinsisted on the concept of the “priesthood of all believers.” Spener clothedthis abstraction with the attractive garments of his erudition. He had very highstandards for the clergy, but his ideal was not different from that of all ofChristian history, that of George Herbert’s “Country Parson,” for example.Ministers should be both pious and learned; but their function was to teachpeople to fish, not to give them fish. The essence of Christian life was withthe individual laity, in Bible-reading, in prayer, in pious social action. Thepastor’s teaching and preaching efforts should be directed toward encouragingindividual piety and the broadest possible lay participation.These Pietist principles are perhaps recognizable in Muhlenbeck’s definition,but another is not. Spener insisted on a kind of theological pacifism. Far fromauthorizing attacks on all those who did not agree with him, he insisted thatreligious discussion—of which there was a very great deal in the world heinherited—should be conducted gently, charitably, and with as little committedpolemicism as possible. If this was a rule chiefly honored in the breach it washardly the first Christian principle of which that could be said.Pietism was thus a “spiritual” movement within the Lutheran Church, one with asignificant “social” dimension. In important respects it closely resembles othersuch movements within the state-Protestant churches such as Puritanism, andespecially Methodism, in England. The question of “separatism” is morecomplicated. Should Christians live “in the world” or establish separate,self-sufficient communities? This was a controverted question. Partly impelledby positive principle, partly prodded by persecution, various groups of radicalProtestants did adopt separatism. That had, after all, been the mode of life ofthose seeking “Christian perfection” since the time of Anthony of the Desert.The sense of “separatism” as used of the Pietists by the German historians ofreligion has a different meaning. It refers to those “extremists” who refused toparticipate in the official state cult or cross the threshold of its temples.There were many Lutherans who sympathized with Pietist ideals and practice. Theyremained within the state Church, like “low church” Anglicans. The German“separatist” Pietists were the equivalent of the English Dissenters. They leftthe state Church altogether. Social separation was a different if cognatephenomenon. To this day there are throughout the world scattered “separatist”groups, descendants of the sixteenth-century Anabaptists, bearing the names oftheir early leaders—Mennonites, Hutterites, Amish. Only at the very end of herlife did Julie de Krüdener contemplate the possibility of a separatistcommunity. Her Pietism, which was born of social contact, would be of a socialvariety.THREE REPRESENTATIVE MEETINGS WITH individual Pietists—using that termloosely—illuminate Julie de Krüdener’s new religious consciousness as revealedin the self-fashioning of her letters. Her conversion, like so many others, wasthe prelude to long periods of self-reproach and morbid speculations concerningthe “Last Things.” But she came to be convinced that God—at first all unknown toher—had begun to take an interest in the minute details of her life.She needed new shoes. In the aristocratic world of that time, haberdashers andshoemakers gladly made house calls. So she sent for a man to come and takemeasurements. The reader must know that in tolerant and multicultural Riga therewas now a small but vital colony of Moravian artisans, including at least onemaster cobbler. By purest chance (or Providence’s plan) it was this man who cameto Julie de Krüdener’s mansion. Either out of modesty, preoccupation, or socialhauteur, she did not even look at the fellow as he measured her foot. But theshoemaker asked her a question about the proposed shoes, and she was nowrequired to turn her face and engage him in conversation. What she saw shook herto the core. The man seemed to radiate with an inner, joyous peace. This seemedto her a reproach for her own melancholy.“My friend,” she asked, “are you a happy man?”“Oh, I am the happiest of men!” was his reply.She said nothing more, and the cobbler departed, measurements in hand, to hislast. But Julie de Krüdener spent a restless night, tossing and turning as shepondered the mystery of felicity. First thing in the morning she set off herselffor the cobbler’s shop, determined to interrogate this poor, humble man who hadapparently found the pearl of great price.More with his life than with his lips this man seemed to preach to her the mosteloquent of sermons. The substance of this sermon has not survived, but we canbe pretty sure it closely resembled the Methodist sermon of the “preacher woman”Dinah in the second chapter of Adam Bede. No one has better or more generouslycaptured the essence of Christian Pietism than the infidel George Eliot. WithJulie’s admiration of his simple gospel piety the dark shadows melted from herspirit. All once again was light.If she ever saw her blessed cobbler again, she left no record of it. Moreenduring—and more annoying to her historians—was Julie de Krüdener’s associationwith Madame Blau, a Livonian widow whom she first met in 1805, and with whom shehad a close spiritual association for many years. Madame Blau seems to have beena type who will be familiar to many readers of nineteenth-century fiction, andto a few perhaps from real life. Madame Blau was, as Knapton puts it, “the firstof that long line of fanatics who came henceforth into the career of poor Juliewith monotonous regularity.” In terms of the world, Madame Blau’s situation washardly an enviable one. She had six children, no husband, and only her wits anddexterous needlework to win bread for her table. Furthermore, she suffered froma chronic nervous condition. It is hard enough to define a “nervous condition”today. The further back in history one moves, the harder still it becomes.Madame Blau’s nervous condition, like Lady Anne Conway’s in the time ofGreatrakes the Stroker, involved frequent headaches of such severity as to sendher to her bed. What most struck Julie in all this was the woman’s preternaturalequanimity in the midst of her sufferings, and her unshakable certainty thatthey were part of an unfathomable divine plan.“She is the happiest creature I have ever seen in my life. She fervently desiresdeath, but only to be separated from sin. She is persuaded that she will enjoyan unspeakable heavenly bliss with her Savior and her God; yet she submits toHim, and by no means prays to die.” Julie, greatly affected, wrote to her friendand co-conspirator Madame Armand: “Oh, my good Armand! Pray, pray as a child! Ifyou are not yet in this blessed state, pray! Ask for that divine grace that Godalways grants for the love of his Son. You will receive it, you will sense thatman cannot be more happy—in this world or the next—without Jesus Christ, withoutthe belief that salvation cannot be granted save by him.…”On May 17, 1807, Julie de Krüdener had an interview with Adam Müller, thepeasant-prophet of Meisenbacherhof, near Nussloch, south of Heidelberg. Therewas a long tradition of humble prophets, women preachers, child evangelists, andother unconventional intermediaries of the divine Word. Through the course ofChristian history, God had repeatedly chosen the weak and powerless as thevessels of His revelation. As the Fathers of the Church had said, Fishermen, notPhilosophers! Julie now thought, Cobblers, not Cardinals. These were the onesthat Christ in his earthly ministry had called to be the bearers of his Gospel.At Christmastime of 1805, an angelic apparition had appeared to Adam Müller witha revelation: there would be a great war among Prussia, Russia, and France.However, the spectral messenger had added a curious coda: “Tell no one!” Thiswas a command later breached, but for the moment Müller held his silence.The messages conveyed to Adam became increasingly political. The next one, abouta year later, commissioned him to set off in search of the king, meaning theKing of Prussia. The message was conventionally severe: “Repent! Bring yourwhole realm to repentance! Trust not in the might of your arms or those of yourallies. Help will come only from the living God.” This injunction was confirmeda fortnight later when he met on the road a grizzled old man carrying, likeMoses, the books of the Law. The graybeard opened his Bible and began reading atconsiderable length from the prophecies of Isaiah. Then he said to Adam: “Go!Repeat what you have heard to the King. Command him, in the name of the eternalGod, to do what is written.… If he submits to the will of the most-high, theFrench will be scattered as the flimsy straw is scattered by the wind.… If herefuses to submit to the Lord’s Commandments, tell him that the scourge of warwill join the scourge of plague and the scourge of famine.”Chiliasm: the Mystery of IniquityThe prophesying of Adam Müller can lead us to a brief consideration ofchiliasm—the second topic that, along with Pietism, defined for Muhlenbeck thecareer of Julie de Krüdener. The word “chiliasm” derives from the Greek word forthousand. It means the same thing as the Latin-derived millennialism. It is atheological belief in the “thousand-year reign” of the returning Christ. Itsliterary “source” is the final book of the Christian Scriptures, the Revelationto St. John.Literary decisions have rarely had a large impact on world history, but thedecision taken by some early Church Fathers that the Book of Revelation wascanonical—that is, a genuine and authoritative part of the divinely revealedWord of God—is perhaps a rare example of one. The Book of Revelation (alsocalled because of its genre the Apocalypse) is an allegorical prose poem thatpresents itself as a “vision” sent by God “through his angel to his servantJohn” on the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea. This John has traditionallybeen identified as the Apostle John, author of the fourth Gospel and of threeshort New Testament epistles; but the identification is doubtful. Historicalcritics of the Bible are inclined to see the book as a response of the Christiancommunity to a crisis of persecution—possibly that of Nero or of Domitian. Thebook’s anti-Roman polemic is unmistakable. It is full of vivid imagery, some ofit “recycled” from the older Jewish Apocalyptic tradition (as in the Book ofDaniel) and some of it apparently contemporary. Certain themes are fairly easyto identify: the persecution of the faithful by powerful evil forces and theeventual triumph of the faithful in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.The Apocalypse is almost certainly a topical if coded “message” to an earlyChristian community, encouraging its perseverance in specific and very difficultcircumstances—namely, a Roman imperial persecution. Its inclusion in the canonhad the tendency to make it timeless, of course, so that its “contemporary”meaning has been sought in every century of Christian history. Today, one isperhaps likely to associate it with strange radio transmissions from Del Rio,Texas, or with pamphlets thrust into one’s hand in the Forty-Second Street busstation. But at no period in history was it more assiduously studied than in theEnlightenment. Among the most fervid of Apocalyptic speculators was Sir IsaacNewton.Of the many perplexing images and episodes in the Apocalyptic book, none hasproved more arresting than the prophecy of a thousand-year reign of Christ,which will occur immediately before the final battle and defeat of Satan and theadvent of the final and eternal Kingdom of Christ (the opening verses of thetwentieth chapter). At the beginning of the passage the visionary sees an angel“coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his handa great chain. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, and bound him for athousand years.” It is this “thousand” (kilias in Greek) that is the root of theword “chiliasm,” meaning an historical or theological view based in aninterpretation of the Apocalypse, and by extension any attempt to apply Bibleprophecy to an interpretation of secular history.The strange, wild images of the Apocalypse have attracted the attention of deepthinkers in every century. They proved to be the capacious and versatile formsthat have supplied the Rorschach inkblots for a hundred historical systems.Their visual realization has provided an iconography of genius from the IberianBeatus manuscripts to the woodcuts of Albrecht Dürer. In the late twelfthcentury Joachim of Fiore, perhaps the greatest of all the chiliasts, completed avast edifice of chiliastic expectation that would haunt the Church for the nextfive hundred years, and in some ways haunts it still. There is hardly a majorChristian thinker of the Renaissance who did not subscribe to some form ofJoachimism, and hardly a major thinker between the period of 1400 and 1700 whodid not indulge in some form of chiliasm. Columbus was a chiliast, as were manyof the early Jesuit missionaries.Though it is significant that we find millenarian clichés and patterns ofthought even in the folk spirituality of a man like Adam Müller, chiliasm wasprimarily a learned mental habit. One form or another of it attracted many ofthe greatest minds of Europe. I have mentioned Isaac Newton, but there wereliterally dozens of others of his stripe. More recent chiliasts are legion,including, among others in the public eye, President Ronald Reagan. As thegeneral “plot” of the Apocalypse involves a titanic struggle of good againstevil, chiliastic (millenarian) thinkers have often sought to understand largeworld conflicts in terms of scriptural prophecy. In particular, chiliasticcommentary has often focused on powerful political or military leaders, such asFrederick II, Charles V, Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin, and Franklin Roosevelt. TheProtestant Reformation occasioned a certain canonization of chiliasticidentifications. Protestant exegetes found it obvious that the whore of Babylonmust be the Pope, while Roman Catholics were sure she was a prophetic emblem ofMartin Luther.When Julie de Krüdener had longed to be a writer among famous writers, shefollowed the obvious pattern of preparation by reading widely and by trying tobecome a part of the literary scene. Now that her ambition was to become a greatChristian soul among other great souls, she followed a similar apprenticeship.There were two great writers among the German Pietists. The first of them wasNikolaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf, who had been born in 1700 and who died inthe year of Julie’s birth, 1764. The other, still very much alive, wasJung-Stilling. Julie began a program of self-improvement by reading the works ofZinzendorf and by entering into correspondence with Jung-Stilling.Zinzendorf: A New GuruCount Zinzendorf, a brilliant polymath, is now generally admitted to be the mostimportant German Reformed theologian between Luther and Schleiermacher. He was apreacher, a poet, a musician, a missionary, and an ecclesiastical diplomat ofrare ability. His fame today rests primarily in his claim to be “the father ofecumenicism,” but in the eighteenth century he was chiefly known for hisconnections with Pietism and with the church of the Moravian Brethren. TheMoravians (also known as the Bohemians) were a group of radical Protestants ineastern Europe, the heirs of John Hus and others. Zinzendorf was a Lutheranmagnate. When some persecuted Moravians sought asylum in Germany, Zinzendorf,greatly impressed by their simple piety and its sad contrast with the tepidformalism of prevailing Lutheran orthodoxy, welcomed them to his own personalproperty.They established a religious community called Herrnhut, and Zinzendorf soonceased to be their landlord or benefactor and became their leader and principaltheologian. What most appealed to Zinzendorf was their simplicity, theirsincerity (he credited them with what he called “the religion of the heart”),and their tolerant spirit, which attempted to focus on evangelical fundamentalsand to discount sectarian dogma. The name of the Moravian Church had originallybeen Unitas Fratrum, the “Unity of the Brothers.” This phrase was taken from theincipit of the 133rd Psalm: Ecce quam bonum et quam jucundum habitare fratres inunum (“Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together inunity”). Indeed, the Brethren perhaps took to its limit the generalizedProtestant phenomenon of the “secularization of asceticism,” turning theirentire community into a lay monastery.Zinzendorf is more important in the rise and spread of Pietist ideas through hispersonality than through his specific doctrines. Nonetheless, he had espoused anumber of the Enlightenment intellectual enthusiasms that have concerned uselsewhere in this book. Among his particular interests was the kabbala. He wasprobably familiar with the very learned book of Budaeus, An Introduction to theHistory of the Philosophy of the Hebrews (1702). And like so many others in hisage, he sought to find in the Apocalypse the meaning of contemporary history.There were two features of Zinzendorf’s religion that would have had aparticular appeal to Julie. The first was its conciliatory and ecumenicalspirit. One of the great achievements of the Enlightenment, as exemplified in aparticularly pleasing way by Voltaire, was its relentless battle for religioustolerance. Wars of religion had devastated Germany in the sixteenth century andFrance in the seventeenth. Religion had been a major factor in the English CivilWar. By their works shall ye know them. One not unnatural response to the bloodyhistory of Christianity was to abandon religion altogether, at least to thedegree that it might be socially possible to do so. Zinzendorf cannot have beenthe first Christian to perceive that, even leaving the strapado and thumbscrewsaside, the spirit of factionalism and sectarianism alone was a terrible obstaclefor Christian apologists. He therefore anticipated one major strand of modernecumenicism in finding that tolerance was the necessary condition of successfulevangelization. Thus, although he was an animated “evangelical,” he taught thattolerance was itself a fundamental doctrine of Christianity.A second point was perhaps even more important. The Moravian Brothers appear tohave been one of the few Christian groups since the time of Jesus and hisdisciples to organize themselves not around creed or confession but aroundcommunity. That is, their emphasis was not in the first instance uponcorrectness of belief but upon correctness of social relations. Theirfoundational written document is accordingly not a creed but a social compact.The metaphoric identification of the entire human race as a single family ofbrothers and sisters has been fairly easy to achieve; but groups who haveattempted to transpose the metaphor into literal reality have usually run intodifficulty from people who imagine a very different model of socialorganization. The radical egalitarianism of the Pietists, as of other “fringe”sects, was an insult and a threat to prevailing social theories of hierarchicalstratification. But it was a mind-set that now drew Julie de Krüdener out of thearistocratic coteries, whether social, religious, or artistic, that had been herwhole life.Julie also would have found in Zinzendorf an appealing aesthetic and poeticelement. He was a poet of sorts, and promoter of a collection of Pietist hymnsby Gerhard Tersteegen, Das geistliche Blumengartlein (The Spiritual Flower Bed),that later had an influence on the formation of Methodist hymnody in England.But the greatest influence upon her was not surprisingly the greatest of livingPietist writers, Johann Heinrich Jung (pseudonym Jung-Stilling, 1740–1817), whomshe now sought out in correspondence. This man became for her a kind of literaryand spiritual guru.Jung-StillingJean-Paul Richter found the path to literary fame by dropping his surname.Johann Heinrich Jung in achieving fame added a second. He had been born into anartisanal family of modest means as Jung. He later added the “Stilling”apparently in allusion to the Psalm verse (35:20) “For civil words they speaknot, but against the peaceful in the land they fashion treacherous speech.…”Luther’s German for the italicized phrase is die Stillen im Lande. If this iscorrect, the Stilling signaled the pacifist and irenic spirit of Pietism. InAnglophone Protestantism the parallel group was of course the Quakers, with whomindeed the German Pietists had many ties. The family Jung nicely exemplifies theoperations of the meritocratic principle that became ever more evident duringthe Enlightenment. The family métiers had been agriculture, then charcoalburning, but various members began to distinguish themselves in the skilledprofessions. One became a lawyer, another an expert toolmaker.Johann Heinrich Jung, who precociously displayed unusual intellectual ability,picked up a scattered but impressive education. Three early influences weredecisive. He had learned to read by reading the Bible, a habit approved by hismother and later reinforced by a much-admired Pietist tailor in Solingen to whomhe was for a time apprenticed. Next, a student friend introduced him to theesoteric tradition: some medico-alchemical writings of Paracelsus, and themystical essays of Jakob Boehme. Finally, he read widely on his own in thecopious philosophical works of Christian von Wolff. Wolff is now studied chieflyby specialists, but before the arrival of Kant he enjoyed enormous authority notonly in Germany but throughout Europe. In his rigorous rationalism, and hisapparent confidence that (pace Kant) the mind was indeed capable of answeringthe questions it posed to itself, he was in a sense an Enlightenment philosopherpar excellence. Young Jung read deeply in Wolff, and with each page found himless satisfactory, more spiritually arid.Walking one day around the lanes of Solingen, where he had taken up anapprenticeship with the Pietist tailor, he saw a brilliantly illuminated cloudin the sky. The external sign was accompanied by an inexplicable but dramaticinner sense of contentment. “He began to tremble in all his limbs, and couldscarcely refrain from sinking to the ground, and from that time he felt a strongdesire to live wholly to the glory of God, and for the welfare of his fellowmen.” When shortly after, on April 12, 1763, Jung-Stilling felt a confirmationof the first revelation, the statutory experience of Pietist conversion wascomplete.Religious conversion was not for him the same as a clerical vocation. He resumeda peripatetic life sufficiently full of engaging experiences and episodes tomake his autobiography something of an adventure tale. The man had, in fact, anextraordinary professional career. His was an age that honored all forms oflearning, including autodidacticism. It was assumed that any educated personought to be able to teach what he or she knew. Hence the private tutors andgovernesses who so thickly populate the pages of eighteenth- andnineteenth-century fiction. That is how he had first become a teacher, and nowbecame one again. He studied that combination of amateur pharmacology andmedicine that we saw in the early career of Cagliostro; later he had more formalmedical training at Strassburg. He became an oculist. There is no reason todisbelieve his description of a successful operation on a woman’s cataracts—anachievement that alone should dispel the charges of mere charlatanism later madeagainst him by his rationalist critics. Periodical essays published while atStrassburg led to his appointment, around his fortieth year, as professor ofpolitical economy at the University of Marburg!But Jung-Stilling’s true vocation would be literary. He became one of the mostfamous German language writers of the century, and the friend of others. Goethegreatly admired him, Herder much less so; but he was in that rank. He commandeda huge “crossover” audience. His first and perhaps his greatest book is hisautobiography, to the writing of which he adopted a remarkable attitude. He madethe writing of his life a life’s work. That is, the autobiography appeared, likea Dickens novel, in serial parts. Just as his life was a work in progress, soalso would be its writing. Its publication dates stretch from 1777, when he wasthirty-seven years old, to 1817, the year of his death.The work is remarkable in its form, which is highly novelistic, always speakingof its author in the third person. While there are no grounds for doubting itsessential truthfulness, it seems clear that it has undergone a process of“spiritual editing” not unlike that discernible in many great examples ofreligious autobiography, such as Augustine’s Confessions. In one sense itbecomes less “literary” as it goes along—meaning that the prose becomesincreasingly chaste. But even as it does so, its philosophical motives becomeincreasingly intrusive.There is a positive and a negative motive. The author wants his readers toanswer a question: Is the course of a man’s life a series of random events, ordoes it reveal a plan? If so, whose plan? Jung-Stilling’s negative motive is tocombat the “atrocity” of Wolff’s philosophical “determinism,” which (inStilling’s view) held that men, like other features of the phenomenal world,developed according to “Nature,” which imposed upon them determining form.Jung-Stilling believed that the purpose of life was to discover and to cooperatewith the plan that God has designed. He wanted to see, and to illustrate, theevidences of God operating in his own life. In his view, this did not encumberthe freedom of the human will. Rather, it returned to men and women the agency,which in his understanding the determinism of rationalist philosophers likeWolff had removed.But it did mean that for most of the time men saw their lives as in a glass,darkly. Life became a kind of cosmic scavenger hunt. Significance waseverywhere, but it was often hidden or disguised; it had to be uncovered ordiscovered. The medieval theologians had an arresting term for the shadowy worldof unreality in which we live out our physical lives. It was the regiodissimilitudinis, the land of unlikeness. Things are not what they seem to be.The man facing the mirror raises a right hand; the mirrored man facing backraises a left hand. It was a world to be deciphered rather than simplyperceived, and all of the oblique arts of eighteenth-century esotericism mightbe needed to decipher it.The allegorical or emblematic mentality had by no means disappeared in theEnlightenment. Figurative patterns of thought were simply too deeply entrenchedin the European psyche to be junked with the rise of empiricism. But allegorycan be thought of in at least two ways: as a mode of construction, or as a modeof interpretation. Jung-Stilling’s sensibility embraced both tendencies. He readlife as a large and continuing allegory, but he also typically advanced hisideas in allegorical mode.His autobiography was widely read in Germany, German Switzerland, and thePietist strongholds in Alsace that would later become one of Julie de Krüdener’stheaters of operation. It was translated also into most European tongues. AnEnglish translation by the seminary theologian Hazelius was widely circulatedamong the “Pennsylvania Dutch,” who were of course actually the PennsylvaniaDeutsch, which is to say German-speakers. It has the historical interest ofhaving issued in 1831 from the press of the Evangelical seminary in Gettysburg,the institution that is remembered in the fatal gazetteer of our Civil War as“Seminary Ridge.”His literary output was varied and enormous, but among his most influentialworks were a number of explicitly theological allegories that made him somethingof the C. S. Lewis of his age. His Aslan—C. S. Lewis’s leonine figure of thecosmic Christ—was called “the Gray Man.” Under this title (Der Graue Mann) hefor several years published a popular religious periodical of frequentlyesoteric tendency—an achievement hardly less remarkable in his publishingcircumstances than in ours. Between 1777 and 1783, he published a theologicaltrilogy of semi-historical novels dealing extensively (and often negatively)with alchemists, Rosicrucian adepts, and other disturbers of the peace of theChurch. Indeed, the consistent motive of his literary work was a defense of hisversion of universalist Christian orthodoxy against the centrifugal tendenciesof the “exalted”—by which he meant separatist—religious movements of the day.But he went a long way toward exaltation himself.This becomes clear from his huge roman fleuve entitled Heimweh, which appeared1794–96, and which caused a great stir throughout Europe and not least in thebreast of Julie de Krüdener. Heimweh means “homesickness” or “nostalgia.”Jung-Stilling uses it in the not uncommon theological sense of the naturalyearning of the soul for its celestial homeland, or the recuperation of anoriginal innocence or rectitude by man in a fallen or sinful state. It is inthis novel that the distinct strain of Jung-Stilling’s chiliasm appearsfull-blown. For if God’s operations were decipherable in the lives of obscurepersons living in the rural hamlets of the German principalities, how could theynot be observable in the stupendous events of European history, and especiallythe stupendous event of Revolution in France?Julie de Krüdener had been born in the year following Jung-Stilling’sconversion. By the time the two met, she was in her still youthful forties, hein his valetudinarian late sixties. By then she believed that her own life wasthe perfect vindication of Jung-Stilling’s theories about the purpose of life,that it must be an urgent search to discover the operations of God in one’s ownlife. They were to form an intimate spiritual friendship, marked by afather-and-daughter affection, yet tinged with the competitive admiration of oldliterary lions.The Lady of the Holy AllianceIt was mentioned earlier, with regard to Cagliostro’s stay in Strassburg, thatthe Alsatian region had a long history of Pietist association. Some of itsvillages and small towns were virtual seedbeds of occult religion. In one suchplace, Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (Markirk by its German name), Julie de Krüdenerfell under the spiritual sway of two extravagant mystics: a Pietist Calvinistpastor named Johann Frederick Fontaines and a self-appointed peasant-prophetessnamed Marie Kümmer. They were an extraordinary pair. Fontaines was a “convertfrom reason.” He had been a Jacobin, or at least a sympathizer with theRevolution’s radical tendencies. Knapton reports the “legend” that he had beenamong the sacrilegious youth who in 1793 had raced their horses through thecathedral of Strassburg. But he soon took up religion of a highly personalkind—that is to say, the Pietist “religion of the heart”—abandoning hisreligious orthodoxy, as he earlier had his political orthodoxy, in favor ofchiliastic meditations and deeply emotional spiritual conferences.Secular chronology, though at best speculative and approximate, has had aprofound influence on Christian Apocalyptic thought. Only quite recently therewas huge excitement among what remains of the chiliastic community as midnightapproached on December 31, 1999. The turn of the millennium inspired aparticular spiritual energy, but the turn of even a commonplace century is notwithout its excitements. Such was the case in the year 1800. In its anticipationFontaines had written a strange prophetical book. It is now extremely rare, andI have not been able to consult it. But he concluded that the countdown to theEnd would begin with the new century, and that the End would arrive at the verylatest by 1836.Marie Kümmer was one of Fontaines’s chief disciples, though her rich spiritualhistory antedated her association with him. Kümmer was a countrywoman of thestyle of Adam Müller, the peasant-prophet. Julie de Krüdener was as deeplyimpressed by her as she earlier had been by Madame Blau. Kümmer became nowsomething of a “role model” for Julie. Marie fell into frequent trances; it wasrumored that she on occasion levitated. Julie did not equal these spiritualprodigies, but she did join with Marie, and sometimes with Fontaines, in intensesessions of ecstatic prayer.Marie Kümmer had achieved biblical literacy, and she studied Pastor Fontaines’sbook about the Last Times with great care. Like Anne Conway’s uncle more than acentury earlier, she became convinced that the advent of the Kingdom of God mustbe preceded by the re-establishment of an earthly kingdom of the righteous onesin Zion. She succeeded in convincing a sizable group of followers, and they tookoff on foot for the Holy Land, actually making it as far as Vienna—about fourhundred miles through often difficult terrain. Julie would later imitate thistrek with her own pilgrimage into the hinterland of the Crimea; but initiallyshe imitated Marie in a different way, by beginning the public itinerantpreaching for which she became famous—and among many of her former associates,infamous.Such were the circumstances of Julie de Krüdener dévote, as she approached themost famous exploit in her life: her supposed role in the formation of the HolyAlliance. The Holy Alliance, proposed by Czar Alexander I and subscribed to byRussia’s triumphant allies Prussia and Austria at the Congress of Vienna in1815, declared that in the future the political policies of Europe’s greatpowers would be conducted on the basis of “Christian principles” ecumenicallyshared among Roman Catholics, the Orthodox, and Protestants. It was that anodyneclause, which in actuality would hardly revolutionize the practice of powerpolitics in the nineteenth century, that could render a sweeping conservativeretrenchment as “holy.” Julie was credited with having first suggested to herfriend Alexander the idea of a formal political pact founded on “Christianprinciples.” It is at least possible that she in fact did so, but thetransmission of a cliché could scarcely claim for her an important role in thepolitical history of the post-Napoleonic settlement. What does seem remarkableis that an increasingly eccentric religious fanatic might still be an intimatefamiliar of the Czar of all the Russias. It is perhaps unkind to suggest aparallel with Rasputin, whom she anticipated by a century.For in the first decade of the nineteenth century Julie de Krüdener arrived at aspiritual tipping point. After that the Masonic occultism, the Pietist chiliasm,and her own personal apocalyptic vision seem to have coalesced in theextravagance that has defined her for history. It is not possible to pinpoint aprecise time or event, but the Battle of Eylau may well have played adeterminative role. On February 7 and 8, 1807, the Grande Armée of the FrenchEmpire met a large Russo-Prussian force on snow-covered terrain in a battleunusually sanguinary even for Napoleonic warfare. There were enormous casualtieson either side, perhaps twenty or thirty thousand altogether. The outcome wasnonetheless inconclusive. Marshal Ney, who had saved the French from what seemedat one point likely defeat, said of his Pyrrhic victory: “Quel massacre! Et sansresultat!”Julie de Krüdener was then living at Königsberg, not far distant. Shortly afterthe battle many citizens of Königsberg, some good Samaritans and some simplysensation-seekers, drove out to view the battlefield. Julie was among them. Thewounded had been mainly cleared away, but there were still corpses promiscuouslystrewn about, some grotesquely maimed and mangled, the stiff carcasses ofhorses, shattered gun emplacements, all the detritus left by the great deathmachine. And everywhere she looked, Julie saw bloody snow. She knew what she wasseeing. “For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now lettethwill let, until he be taken out of the way.” (II Thessalonians 2:7) The “worker”of the mystery of iniquity was the emperor Napoleon!Julie de Krüdener was a European aristocrat. Her friends were aristocrats, orthe protégées of aristocrats. During most of the years of her wanderings she hadbeen constantly in the company of French émigrés, one of whom was the father ofher illegitimate child. Her experience of the Revolution had been entirelynegative. As she became increasingly “religious,” then traveled more and moreamong religious people, she began to see the Revolution as so many of them hadseen it—in terms of a chiliastic theology of history.Napoleon Bonaparte was either the continuation of the Revolution, or itspersonification. None of the other leaders of the Revolution had lasted longenough to attract the attention of millenarian exegetes. Napoleon was different.In him the awful power of the Revolution reached its apex and what, in the firstdecade of the nineteenth century, appeared to be permanence. France’s imperialexpansion seemed to its neighbors, including Britain across the Channel, aterrifying threat to everything that had created Christendom and its values.Naturally the anxiety was the highest in those duchies of “Germany” directlyabutting upon French national territory. We saw that anxiety in the supernatural“messages” of the peasant-prophet Müller for the Prussian king. But it was felthardly less acutely in the further tiers of European territories: in Austria andMoravia, which was the scene of the campaign of 1805, along the Baltic littoralfrom Danzig to St. Petersburg, in Prussia from Königsberg toward Vilna and theRussian heartland. In these lands many of the “prophets” were of higher socialstation than Adam Müller.ART IMITATES LIFE WHICH, as we know, imitates art. The murky pathway to Julie deKrüdener’s political chiliasm is somewhat illuminated by the artistry of one ofthe world’s greatest novelists, Leo Tolstoy. Though War and Peace was publishedtwo generations after the events with which it chiefly deals, it reveals onnearly every page the careful researches of the realistic historical novelist.The opening scene of War and Peace is set at an aristocratic soirée in St.Petersburg in July 1805. Its opening words are some banter of the party’shostess, Anna Pavlovna Scherer, to her friend Prince Vasili Kuragin: “Well,Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But Iwarn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defendthe infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really do believe heis Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you.…”The identification of Napoleon with the Antichrist was widespread before 1805,and nearly universal by 1812. It is thus not surprising that it had importantimpact on the most sensational episode of Julie de Krüdener’s career. It is truethat we do not know precisely at what point she had herself concluded thatNapoleon Bonaparte was the Antichrist. Even the French historians who have mostdeeply studied the sinister myths or “black legend” surrounding Napoleon haveidentified no single “source” of the chiliastic identification. But itselements—exegetical, esoteric, Rosicrucian—were precisely those easily foundamong the Masonic lodges of the German cities and the religious meetings of thePietists. The “legend” is preserved in its most complete form in certainpost-Revolutionary writers, and in particular by some of the Catholic clergy andreactionary political critics associated with the program of French“re-Christianization.” The most remarkable of these, in terms of his literaryproduction, is the priest Jean Wendel Würtz.A brilliant bibliographer, André Blavier, has produced for France a referencework of inestimable value entitled Les fous littéraires. One can only hope forthe early appearance of its analogue for the Anglophone world. It is abibliography of crackpots—religious, scientific, medical, metaphysical—of whomthe French nation produced unusually fascinating specimens throughout theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries. French “prophets” were numerous among them,and some of Blavier’s bio-bibliographics are uniquely valuable contributions tothe study of the esoteric thought of the period that now concerns us. He hasgathered together what is known about Würtz, who after the Revolution became therector of the principal parish of Lyon.According to Blavier, Würtz was born in Germany around 1760. Another Jean WendelWürtz, undoubtedly a relative, was born in the hamlet of Walschbronn on theMoselle in Lorraine in 1784. We may guess that the abbé Würtz conducted hisearly ministry among the émigrés of nearby Coblenz, at the confluence of theMoselle and the Rhine. He was among the first Catholic clergy restored in Lyon,and the Revolutionary history of that city is undoubtedly relevant to hisattitudes. In 1793, Lyon had attempted to “secede” from the Revolution by sidingwith the defeated Girondins. In a suspect judicial action that almostimmediately became for the Jacobins in Paris a casus belli, the radical JosephChalier was guillotined in Lyon that July. The Convention eventually unleashedupon the city a terrible punishment that included the destruction of importantcivic buildings and the brutal execution of more than two thousand citizens.Saint-Nizier, the great Gothic church of which Würtz would later become rector,escaped total destruction but not desecration. It was transformed into a flourwarehouse, with bakers’ boys and carters camping out in the chapels where thesacred sacrifice had been performed of old.The atrocities perpetrated against the second city of the Republic by the firstwere not soon forgotten. Napoleon did his best to placate the survivors byordering the replacement of destroyed buildings. He could not, however,resuscitate the slain burghers, whose families still dominated the city’ssociety and commerce. During the Restoration, the Lyon town fathers continued tocultivate a memory of royalist resistance to the Revolution. For such a “black”city, the reactionary abbé Würtz was an appropriate pastor.In 1816, Würtz published the first edition of Les précurseurs de l’Anté-Christin Lyon. The book caught on, and went through a number of enlargements andreprintings. It met with considerable favor among a certain audience. That thatfavor was not quite universal is suggested by a prefatory statement in Würtz’snext book, Superstitions et prestiges des philosophes, ou, Les démonlâtres dusiècle des lumières (Lyon, 1817). Here the author shrugs off the certainty thatsome people, more to be pitied than censured, would laugh at him.Les précurseurs de l’Anté-Christ is an interpretation of the final book of theChristian Scriptures. Its purpose is clearly stated in a subtitle: “AProphetical History of the most notorious Impieties appearing since theestablishment of the Church, up to the year 1816, OR, the French Revolution asPredicted by St. John the Evangelist.” In it Napoleon Bonaparte, now “chained”like Satan on the island of St. Helena, plays the major role of the “Angel ofthe Bottomless Pit.”This terrible figure appears in the ninth chapter of the Apocalypse, followingthe sound of the trumpet of the fifth angel. The relevant details are these. TheAngel of the Bottomless Pit (the Greek word being abyss) is the “king” of a vastarmy of locusts, which in appearance “were like horses equipped for battle. Theyhave divine leave to torture earth’s inhabitants for five months.” Theangel-king has a name. “His name in Hebrew is Abaddon; and in Greek he is calledApollyon.” “Apollyon” means Exterminans, the Destroyer or Exterminator.The mathematics of the exegesis deployed by Würtz may seem startling to us, butit was familiar to even the most amateur of esotericists in his audience. Thebiblical “day” often in fact indicates a year. All months should be regarded,for interpretive purposes, as having thirty days. Hence “five months” actuallymeans a hundred and fifty years (5 × 30); but as there are two periods of fivemonths (Rev. 9:5 and 9:10), the actual prophecy is one of three hundred years.These are the three hundred years between the inception of the ProtestantReformation and the advent of the Exterminator. By the fifth printing Würtz wasapologizing for a lapse of memory by which he had originally dated the beginningof Luther’s Reformation to 1515 instead of 1516. It is clear why he made theerror. In his mind the three-hundred-year period of which John darkly wrote wasthe age between the unchaining of Luther and the chaining of Napoleon; but1516–1816 (the year of publication of the Précurseurs) would serve as well as1515–1815. As he approaches his explanation of the Exterminans, Würtz makes agenerous concession to earlier interpreters of the Book of Revelation. They hadall to a man interpreted the malign figure in the rather general sense of theheresies with which they were familiar. The eyewitnesses to the enormity of theFrench Revolution could have no doubt concerning the true meaning.In Würtz’s scheme the heresies of Protestantism both prepared for and weresuperseded by the horrors of “philosophy,” by which he means the doctrines ofthe philosophes working through the Masonic lodges. His representativephilosophe, interestingly, is not Voltaire but the materialist Holbach.Protestants had merely attacked specific Catholic doctrines concerningsacramental theology and church governance. The philosophes had a much moreradical program: the destruction of Christianity altogether. Of earlier exegetesBossuet had come the closest to seeing the full truth, for he had predicted thatProtestantism must end in infidelity.Recent history had removed the veil of mystery that had disguised the figure ofApollyon Exterminans. “Who is this Angel from the abyss, that is to say thisapostle, this ambassador of the infernal Dragon? Do you not recognize Napoleon?Is he not here designated virtually by his own name [nAPOLEON/APPOLYON]? Is henot perfectly signified by the name ‘Exterminator’? Who ever exterminated moremen than he?” Würtz is prepared to brook no dissent. It is a specious argumentthat Napoleon actually restored Catholicism in the Concordat, his famous formaltreaty with the Pope. Würtz declares that a mere ruse, a stepping stone to thethrone. The abbé is aware that the exiled emperor may remain a hero to thesimple and the shallow. Let them remember the anarchist cry heard in the verystreets of Lyon: “Long live Hell!” (Vive l’enfer!) Was that not the very crywith which the deluded veterans greeted their idol upon his escape from Elba?All doubts will disappear, Würtz thinks, for the reader who considers thethousand-year reign of Christ and the martyrs (Rev. 20). The abbé identifiesthis as the period of the French monarchy, mythically considered, which beganwith Charlemagne in 800 and ended (approximately) in 1800, either with theexecution of Louis XVI in 1793 or the coronation of Napoleon in 1804. But ofparticular importance is John’s invocation of the great war unleashed by Gog andMagog (Rev. 20:8). As this is an image taken from the prophet Ezekiel, hereturns to the source. There in the horrifying images of the thirty-eighth andthirty-ninth chapters, he finds what he cannot doubt is a description ofNapoleon’s disastrous retreat from Moscow, when starving men did indeed eathorses, and even in some instances the flesh of their own dead comrades in arms.I have not been able to determine whether Tolstoy had read the fantastic booksof the abbé Würtz. But there can be no doubt that he was familiar with theirgenre. Another passage in War and Peace deals explicitly with the kind of numbermysticism and gematria that were staples of Enlightenment occultism.In a central chapter of War and Peace the novel’s hero, Pierre Bezukhov, arrivesat the conclusion that the emperor Napoleon is the Antichrist and that he,Bezukhov, has the sacred duty to assassinate him. The first conclusion ischild’s play. First you must adapt the ancient conventions of kabbalisticgematria to the Latin alphabet in the manner favored by the mystical Freemasonsof Lyon, as follows:images [../Images/p393.jpg]You then write out, in French, the title L[e] Empereur Napoléon, cheating everso slightly by not eliding the e of the article. Now add it all up to get 666,the “number of the Beast” (see Revelation 13:18). More important from Pierre’spoint of view is that in the fifth verse of that same chapter it is written thatthe beast will be given authority for a period of “forty and two months.”Pierre, an erudite fellow, knows that when the Bible speaks of “days” or“months” it actually means years. He knows as well that the year is 1812,meaning that Napoleon, born in 1769, must in fact be forty-two years old.It takes Pierre a little while to figure out his numerological role in the greatscheme of things, but he does so after a certain amount of orthographicjiggery-pokery, this time dropping an e that should be there. It turns out thatthe phrase L’Russe Besuhof (roughly, duh Russian Bezukhov) is also a 666. So thebeast has come to the end of his allotted time. Forty-two is all you get.History buffs and readers of Tolstoy will know that things didn’t quite workout, but that was the theory.It becomes necessary to dwell on the strange interpretation that Pierre finds inthe number 42. According to Douglas Adams in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to theGalaxy, 42 contains the meaning of “everything.” The old exegetes were perhapsless global in their claims, but more specific in their demonstration. For thenumber 42 has an ancient and distinguished history in both the sacred and thesecular esoteric traditions, and of course also in the marriage of the two thatwas Rosicrucian mysticism. In terms of human age measured in years, 42 is one ofthe important “climacterics,” or seven-year periods, providing the punctuationpoints of a man’s life. The basis of this idea is the heptameral scheme ofCreation as recorded in the Book of Genesis and reflected in the structure ofthe calendrical week.Certain ideas that now appear to us very strange and contrived seemed to ourancestors almost too obvious to demand comment—though fortunately they didcomment on them in such detail that we can often reconstruct them with adequateconfidence. Seven was one of the Pythagorean building blocks of the universe,and also of human life, as Shakespeare records in Jaques’s famous lines about“the ages of man”:All the world’s a stage,And all the men and women merely players:They have their exits and their entrances;And one man in his time plays many parts,His acts being seven ages.Less well known, perhaps, though hardly of less theological importance, are theseven ages of world history—or rather, the world’s six ages and its eternalpostlude. For the Fathers of the Church, and especially and most influentiallyAugustine, had divided all of human history, the history of salvation, into sixages. The precise points of division varied slightly among the theorists, butall were agreed that the final age, the Sixth Age, was the Age of theIncarnation. It had begun with the fullness of the divine revelation in theperson of Jesus Christ. All who lived after Christ were living in the Sixth Age.The final period of cosmic history—final and eternal—would be heralded by theSecond Coming. These ideas had been commonplace among the patristic writers andthey were commonplace still among the Protestant Pietists of the eighteenthcentury. The product of the root of the climacteric (7) and the Age of theIncarnation (6) is 42.It is remarkable that it is but a short step from medieval mystery toEnlightenment Illuminism. Julie de Krüdener turned to the mysteries of numbers.Now 4, 5, and 7—to name but three—all had more or less highly elaboratedallegorical significance in ancient philosophy; but it was the conventions ofChristian scriptural exegesis that spread number symbolism throughout Europeanculture. All the numbers of the decade—that is to say, 1 through 10—hadcommonplace theological associations that survive even today in stock phrasesand folklore. Most people, however secular, are probably aware that there arefour evangelists, seven deadly sins, ten commandments, and so forth. Otherreferences may be deeply arcane. A strange usage of the word “rivals”—the“three, three, the rivals” of the folk round “Green Grow the Rushes—O”—isprobably a reference to the Christian Trinity. Here “rival” seems to preserveits ancient Latin etymology of “riverbank” (as in the rive gauche of the Seinein Paris) and mean one of several anglers “fishing in the same stream.”One biblical chapter alone has called forth a whole library of numerologicalexegesis: the thirteenth chapter of the Apocalypse. There in verse 13 we learnthat the beast who speaks “great things and blasphemies” has been given thepower to “continue for forty and two months.” And in the eighteenth and finalverse of the chapter we learn “the number of the Beast,” which is “the number ofa man,” and that number is 666. One other Apocalyptic number completes theanthology: 1,260. In the eleventh chapter we are told that the “two witnesses”will testify for 1,260 days; in the twelfth that the woman clothed with the sunwill find a safe place in the wilderness for 1,260 days. An uninstructed readermay welcome a little help with these numbers, beginning with the fact, alreadynoted, that for the exegetes the words “days” and “months” are poetic figuresmeaning years. The periods of duration are therefore related in the followingobvious way. It was forty-two generations from Abraham to Christ, but how longwas that in years? It was assumed by convention that there are thirty years in ageneration. Thirty multiplied by 42 is 1,260. Hence the first covenant, thepromises made to Abraham, dated from 1260 BC. Twelve hundred and sixty yearslater saw the birth of Jesus Christ. Thinking by analogy, quite a fewthirteenth-century Christians anticipated some great apocalyptic event in theyear 1260.There are, however, also several instances of rather more complex biblicalnumbers. In the story of the miraculous catch of fish in the Gospel of John(21:1–14), Peter pulls his net to the shore to find therein 153 big fish. Thisis an odd number in more senses than one. Many biblical numbers seem to give thesense of “a lot” or “a long time” (“seventy times seven,” the number of timesyou should forgive your enemy, or “forty days and forty nights,” the duration ofthe protracted rainstorm that flooded the earth). The number 153, on the otherhand, suggests the quality of a classified statistic. Peter didn’t just catch alot of fish without breaking his net; he caught precisely 153, and they were bigones. Medieval exegetes knew the number could not be accidental, and they wentto extraordinary lengths to interpret it. Very often they found in it themesrelating to evangelism or conversion, since in another more famous passage Jesuspromised his piscatorial followers that they would now become “fishers of men.”Scholars have claimed to find traces of such “meanings” in the proportions andcertainly the decorations of some medieval ecclesiastical buildings.There is, however, a distinction to be made between the extraordinary and thefantastic. One will ransack the extraordinary medieval sources in vain withoutdiscovering such fantastic Enlightenment arcana as the following. The height ofthe Great Pyramid of Cheops, as determined by French and British investigatorsof the Grand Age, is 486.256 feet. The length of its base is 763.81 feet. Now itis child’s play to discover that the product of the base multiplied by pi raisedto the fourth power divided by the sum of the height and the tenth part of pirenders 152.999999344—and what are 656 billionths among friends?But 42 is in a class by itself.Seven and 9 were heavily fraught even before they came under the scrutiny of therabbis and the patristic exegetes, and they were the two factors of what werecalled the climacterics. That is, any number into which 7 or 9 could be dividedevenly was thought to be of probable arcane significance. The actual product of9 and 7, 63, was called the “Grand Climacteric”; and it was regarded as aparticularly dangerous number. Indeed, it was often the “fatal” number, since agreat many people were supposed to have died in their sixty-third orsixty-fourth years, as they probably did in ages in which male life expectancyhovered in the forties. Forty-two, being the product of 7 and 6, was one of thelesser climacterics and, on the whole, a benign one. It will be seen thatforty-two lies midway between the climacteric of twenty-one, which emerged asthe legal age of majority in European law, and therefore was a kind ofbeginning, and the Grand Climacteric of sixty-three, which threatened to be anend. Forty-two could therefore be regarded as a number of maturity orcompletion, and in this conclusion secular and biblical numerologists were inagreement.The biblical occurrences ranged from the sublime to the whimsical. Of the formerare the forty-two “mansions” or stations of the Exodus. That is, if you make upa list of all the places that the Hebrews stopped on their way to the PromisedLand, you will find that there are forty-two of them. Since the Exodus is thevery type of the pattern of redemption, 42 suggests itself as a number offulfillment or completion. Among the more whimsical incidents in prophetichistory, perhaps, is that of the forty-two bad boys who got eaten up by anunspecified number of bears for the rude discourtesy of calling Elisha “Baldy.”But the definitive 42, so to speak, the instance that linked the number with allserious schemes of medieval Christian chronology, will be found at the beginningof the Gospel of Matthew. There one finds a genealogy of Jesus Christ. As it ispatrilineal, it begins with the patriarch Abraham and ends with Joseph, thespouse of Jesus’ mother. There are forty-two generations between Abraham andChrist, and they are deployed in three groupings of fourteen, fourteen being thefirst of the complex climacterics.In its relationship to sacred history, 42 was the number of completion. At thebirth of Christ what had first been promised to Abraham before the Law, thenconfirmed in Moses under the Law, was now fulfilled under grace. It is for thisreason, eventually, that so many medieval and Renaissance literary worksstructure themselves around the number 42. Dante’s spiritual autobiography, theVita Nuova, is “naturally” divided into forty-two chapters. In the margins ofthe unique manuscript of Beowulf some early editor has added puzzling divisionsin Roman numerals. Nobody knows quite what they are about, but there areforty-two of them.Barbara Juliana Vietinghof, later Madame la baronne de Krüdener, was born inNovember 1764. She completed her climacteric year in November 1806. But thenumbers sometimes needed a little help, just as Pierre Bezukhov had needed alittle help. The phrase le Empereur Napoléon might be bad French, but it’s greatgematria! Likewise he discovered that the French cardinal number 42(quarante-deux) renders the same result. And (three exclamation points!!!)Napoleon, born on August 15, 1769, is forty-two years old in 1812, if oneregards not the year in which Napoleon completed his forty-second year of life(1811) but the year during which, in popular parlance, he “was” forty-two yearsold. To make two years of one is perhaps a minor miracle when compared with theloaves and the fishes, and it was within the easy grasp of the mysticalimagination. Madame de Krüdener nowhere to my knowledge explicitly addresses themystical chronology of her vocation as a prophetess, but her definitiveabandonment of the role of literary rock star in favor of that of itinerantpreacher corresponds nicely to her visit to the corpse-littered battlefield ofEylau (February 1807)—by easy accommodation her climacteric year.THE LAST YEARS OF Julie de Krüdener’s life were tragicomic as she moved aboutpreaching in the German-speaking lands from Switzerland (where she had anunfortunate association with a crazed young woman who crucified herself) to EastPrussia. She and her friends were frequently harassed by the police. But to thisperiod of her life belongs, possibly, her greatest triumph. She had much earlierbecome a friend of Czar Alexander I. The Romanovs even then, a century beforeRasputin, showed a weakness for religious counselors of a strange kind. It wasallegedly in a séance with Madame de Krüdener that the emperor conceived theidea of the Holy Alliance proclaimed at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Thispact, according to which the subscribing states committed themselves to upholdthe principles of the Christian religion, was part of the reaction to Napoleon,and an effort to reverse the consequences of the French Revolution in Europe.Julie de Krüdener died in 1824 in an obscure part of the Crimea, where she hadgone on her last preaching mission with the apparent aim of establishing amillenarian community. The unknown location of her tomb became the subject ofhistorical legend.She had been born late in the year 1764, a few weeks after the young Gibbon hadthe brainwave that would in time become one of the greatest of all works ofEnlightenment historiography. “It was Rome, on the fifteenth of October 1764,”he writes, “as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefootfriars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writingthe decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.” It might at firstseem impossible to imagine two sensibilities or intellectual personalities moredisparate. Yet each of them was a true inheritor of different legacies of theAge of Lights.BibliographicalThere are many good books dealing with some of the French literary influences onJulie de Krüdener. These include two of the older biographies, J. ChristopherHerold’s Mistress to an Age: A life of Madame de Staël (Indianapolis, 1958), andAndré Maurois, Chateaubriand: Poet, Statesman, Lover (English trans. New York,1938). George Painter completed only the first volume of his biography ofChateaubriand, which does not take the story up as far as his dealings withJulie.Her important German connections are more difficult to get at. There is littlein English about Jean-Paul Richter outside the standard encyclopedic sources.Jung-Stilling’s autobiography was translated into English, and copies are to befound in the larger libraries. The German version is frequently reprinted inscholarly format. There is a collection of German essays, many of them relevantto this book, in Zwischen Strassburg und Petersburg: Voträge aus Anlass des 250Gebutrstag von Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling, ed. Peter Wörster (Siegen, 1992).Many of Julie’s Pietist gurus (including Zinzendorf) are treated in CarterLindberg’s The Pietist Theologians: An Introduction to the Theology of theSeventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (Malden, MA, 2005).Chauncey Tinker’s golden oldie The Salon and English Letters (New York, 1915) isa good English introduction to the idea of the literary salon, though morerelevant to Madame de Krüdener are such books as Marie Gougy-François, Lesgrands salons féminins (Paris, 1965), or the elegant anthology put out by theMusée Carnavalet in 1928, Les grands salons littéraires.Concerning the Holy Alliance there is a good English-language introduction in W.P. Cresson, The Holy Alliance: The European Background of the Monroe Doctrine(Oxford, 1922). More directly relevant to Julie de Krüdener are E.
