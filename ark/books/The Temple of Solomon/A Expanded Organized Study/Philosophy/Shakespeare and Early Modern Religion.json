Most notably, this volumeexplores Shakespeare’s creative engagement with early modern religiousculture, but it does so without assuming that Shakespeare can himself bealigned with any specific doctrinal beliefs, religious group, or confession.The chapters in this book thus eschewfirm or reductive assertions aboutShakespeare’s personal religious convictions. Instead, contributors focus onhis imaginative recasting of different currents of early modern religiousculture and beliefs in their great variety, an array of perspectives that wasat once contradictory, competing, and deeply contested.Like the Cambridge University Press volume onShakespeare and EarlyModern Political Thoughtedited by David Armitage, Conal Condren, andAndrew Fitzmaurice,1this book offers fresh interdisciplinary perspectives on alarge topic that has generated much critical controversy. In doing so, it islikely to generate more discussion, since it does little to resolve the vexedquestion of Shakespeare’s confessional position or positions. This volume istimely, however, because both literary scholars and historians of early modernreligion contribute their particular insights into religious matters and debatesin relation to Shakespeare’s plays. We have attempted, in bringing togetherhistorians of religion and literary critics, to engage both specialists and moregeneral readers of Shakespeare, including student readers–anyone interestedin tracing Shakespeare’s imaginative engagement with the variety of religiousbeliefs and practices that characterizes early modern English culture.1David Armitage, Conal Condren, and Andrew Fitzmaurice (eds.),Shakespeare and Early ModernPolitical Thought(Cambridge University Press,2009).1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"How do Shakespeare’s plays give dramatic, imaginative, and provoca-tive expression to diverse early modern religious perspectives and faiths–some of them contradictory, paradoxical, and dissonant–withoutresolving them? This volume attemptsto address this question in relationto the religious complexities and changing culture of Shakespeare’sEngland. Shakespeare gives dramatic expression to both Protestant andCatholic perspectives in his plays, a reminder that he lived in an agemarked by tumultuous religious change and divisions brought about bythe cataclysm of the Reformation that shattered western Christendom.Henry VIII’s England, in which Shakespeare’sfatherwasborn,waspredominantly a Catholic nation, albeit a nation riven with tensions andinstabilities generated by the evangelical culture of the Reformation.2Catholics were still widespread during the early years of Elizabeth’sreign,3but by the time Shakespeare was thriving as a playwright inLondon–in the late1580s, the1590s, and thefirst twelve or thirteenyears of the seventeenth century–England was predominantly aProtestant nation, Elizabeth herself having been excommunicated anddeposed in a papal bull of1570for“usurping monster-like the place ofthe chief sovereign of the church of England”and prohibiting“theexercise of true religion”and the Roman Church.4To be sure, therewere plenty of ambiguities and inconsistencies within the Elizabethanreligious settlement (which“wedded an essentially Calvinist theology toan essentially Catholic institutional structure, minus the pope”),5although Elizabeth identified herself as a Protestant ruler.These tensions persisted over the course of Shakespeare’s life, asElizabeth’s successor–James I, the patron of Shakespeare’s King’s Men–self-consciously presented himself in print as a major Protestant exegete andtheologian (thefigure of“Religio”appears prominently on the1616titlepage of hisWorkes). The English Reformation, although long and partial,was ultimately, in the words of Diarmaid MacCulloch, a“howling2See Alec Ryrie,The Gospel and Henry VIII: Evangelicals and the Early English Reformation(CambridgeUniversity Press,2003); Peter Marshall and Alec Ryrie (eds.),The Beginnings of English Protestantism(Cambridge University Press,2002).3SeeChapter2below, p.42.4SeeRegnans in excelsis, in Robert S.

Likewise, the degree to which he can even be characterizedas a religious playwright remains subject to debate.Shakespeare and EarlyModern Religionchallenges and complicates one-sided attempts to attributeto Shakespeare himselffirm or rigid religious identifications, affiliations, orsets of religious practices (e.g., Shakespeare-as-Catholic or Shakespeare-as-Calvinist). Instead, the chapters in this volume stress the ways Shakespeare’splays explore, by giving voice to, a wide range of religious beliefs, practices,and confessional positions circulating in Shakespeare’s England.Shakespeare and Early Modern Religionaddresses a number of majorquestions about Shakespeare’s plays in relation to the religious culture,divisions, allegiances, and intellectual history of early modern Englandand Europe. How orthodox or mainstream are the religious perspectivesdramatized in Shakespeare’s plays? How experimental and daring areShakespeare’s plays, especially the tragedies, when it comes to representingearly modern religious thought, experience, speculation, and anxieties? DoShakespeare’s plays implicitly endorse, question, challenge, or complicateProtestant orthodoxy and the widespread belief in providentialism in early6Diarmaid MacCulloch,“The Impact of the English Reformation,”Historical Journal,38(1995),152.See also Alexandra Walsham,Providence in Early Modern England(Oxford University Press,1999),p.4; Peter Marshall (ed.),The Impact of the English Reformation,1500–1640(London: Edward Arnold,1997); Patrick Collinson,The Religion of the Protestants: The Church in English Society,1559–1625(Oxford: Clarendon Press,1982), andThe Birthpangs of Protestant England: Religious and CulturalChange in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries(New York: St. Martin’s Press,1988).7On Catholicism as an ongoing topic of intense political discussion and anxiety throughout the span ofShakespeare’s career (and beyond), see also Alexandra Walsham,Church Papists: Catholicism,Conformity, and Confessional Polemic in Early Modern England(Woodbridge: Boydell & Brewer,1993); Alison Shell,Catholicism, Controversy and the English Literary Imagination(CambridgeUniversity Press,1999); and Michael C.

How do the plays interrogate and test, in original andpowerful ways, early modern religious prejudices towards Catholics,Puritans, Jews, Muslims, and radical religious groups (e.g. Brownists)?Can these theatrical works be seen in the context of notions of tolerationand intolerance in the early modern period? Do they challenge ways wethink about the categories of the secular and the religious in the earlymodern period and the boundary critics have sometimes constructedbetween them? Finally, how does Shakespeare explore the relations betweenreligious beliefs, politics, and issues of early modern English nationalidentity and chauvinism?The chapters in this volume likewise consider the degree to which weview Shakespeare as a religious playwright. If Shakespeare wrote“scriptsthat were intensely alert to the social and political realities of their times,”8he also wrote plays that were equally alive to the religious tensions of theirtimes. Yet while modern criticism has produced books with such titles asPolitical ShakespeareorShakespeare’s Political Drama,9it might seem odd toentitle a studyReligious ShakespeareorShakespeare’s Religious Drama.Shakespeare, after all, was not a religious playwright in the sense thatJohn Bale or John Foxe were. Religion nonetheless permeatesShakespeare’s plays: it does so in terms of their great wealth of biblicalallusions,10in their echoes of the Book of Common Prayer and the Psalter,11and in their uses of religious language (sometimes for comic or parodicpurposes as in the cases of characters like Bottom or the vivacious Falstaff,the latter wittily employing godly language as he banters with Prince Hal).The plays simultaneously evoke features of both Catholic and Protestantculture, and it is this richness that makes it difficult for us to pinpointShakespeare’s own doctrinal allegiances. The plays, for example, refer to keyreligious concepts and places (e.g., Heaven or thefires of Hell andPurgatory); to the notion of salvation and damnation (central to under-standing the non-Roman tragedies); and to religious institutions and build-ings (e.g., parishes as well as chantries),financial systems (tithes), liturgical8Stephen Greenblatt,Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare(New York:W.

The plays can also vividly depict thedemonic imagination and demonic possession; examine both zealous andnon-Protestant religious groups (e.g., Puritans, Catholics, Jews, orMuslims); and explore religious hatred and prejudices. They representcharacters burdened with guilt and sinfulness, who struggle to show con-trition and seek forgiveness; they dramatize spiritual resurrection, miracles,and faith;12and they depict individuals, notably Hamlet, who engage inanxious religious questioning and express profound uncertainty about theworld beyond this one.Yet despite the rich presence of religion in the plays, it is hard to think ofShakespeare as a religious writer in the same way that we consider Spenser orthe zealous Milton as authors deeply committed to religious causes ortheological doctrines.13Shakespeare’s plays, David Kastan asserts,“assumea world in which God is immanent,”14and yet his most devastating tragedyand depiction of extreme human suffering,King Lear, arguably challengesthe very idea of such immanence and the widespread religious perception inearly modern England that God’s hand was directly and assiduously at workin the world, constantly intervening in human affairs.15It may indeed make more sense to view Shakespeare as a writer whoseplays engage creatively and dramatically with various–and sometimescontradictory and dissonant–facets of religious culture in early modernEngland and Europe without, in the end, his being a deeply or consistentlyreligious writer who makes clear-cut confessional choices.16In any case, asthe chapters in this volume remind us, it is hard to think of Shakespeare as adoctrinaire religious author and even harder to think of him as a writer whoidentified with militant religious causes (as, say, Sidney, Spenser, andMilton did). Furthermore, as the chapters in this volume attest, it is difficultto be sure of Shakespeare’s personal religious convictions, despite claims–far from certain–that his father was a Catholic,17in the way we can know12On this topic, see Richard C. McCoy,Faith in Shakespeare(Oxford University Press,2013), whichexamines the recovery or awakening of faith not in a narrowly religious sense but in relation to thepowers offigurative language, theatrical illusion, and stagecraft. See alsoChapter11below.13See David Kastan,A Will to Believe: Shakespeare and Religion(Oxford University Press,2014), p.4.Also seeChapter4below for ways in which Shakespeare differs from Spenser in handling Reformationissues.14Kastan,Will to Believe,p.6.15Walsham,Providence in Early Modern England, pp.2,6.16Cf. Alison Shell,Shakespeare and Religion, Arden Shakespeare Critical Editions (London:Bloomsbury,2010), who notes Shakespeare’s“confessional invisibility”(p.235).17The indecisive evidence for“John Shakespeare and Catholicism”is carefully reviewed in thebiographical entry for Shakespeare by Peter Holland in theOxford Dictionary of National Biography(www.oxforddnb.com); moreover, as Holland notes,“there is...no reason to assume that the adultWilliam shared his father’s religious views,”even if they were Catholic.Introduction5"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Jonson’s with his conversion to Roman Catholicism and his re-conversionto the Church of England.18Despite documentary evidence concerningShakespeare’s life, we possess no personal letters, diaries, autobiography,testaments of faith, or religious tracts or treatises that might give us someinsight into his religious persuasions or ecclesiastical allegiance. To be sure,the plays dramatize both Catholic and Protestant perspectives: for example,Hamlet Senior’s Ghost has come from Purgatory (central to RomanCatholic teaching) and refers to Catholic liturgical practices which he hasbeen denied (see1.5.76–9), whereas Hamlet voices religious views thatevoke the newer reformed ideas of Luther and Calvin.19In a larger sense,Hamletimaginatively dramatizes an unresolved tension at the heart of theunfinished Elizabethan Reformation and the church: vestiges of Catholicliturgy juxtaposed with Protestant theology and a Protestant church stillhaunted by its Catholic past.20Yet this religious ambiguity or tensiondramatized inHamlethardly reveals Shakespeare’s own personal persua-sions which, perhaps, must remain as mysterious as the cosmos Hamletspeculates about.It may instead be more fruitful to ask why Shakespeare evokes bothCatholic and Protestant dimensions in his great tragedy, and to stressthedramatic and imaginative usesto which he as a creative and independent-minded playwright puts these competing and dissonant religious perspec-tives. The Christian Hamlet is deeply influenced by a Reformation view ofhuman nature: his corrosive and weary sense of the depravity of humankindaccords with a sense that Denmark is rotten, sick, and claustrophobic, sothat his world has become“a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours”18See Ian Donaldson,Ben Jonson: A Life(Oxford University Press,2011), esp. pp.138–44,271–5. ForShakespeare’s biography in relation to the elusive problem of his religious beliefs and the question ofhis father’s Catholicism, see esp.Chapter1below; see also Kastan,Will to Believe, ch.2. Cf.Jeffrey Knapp,Shakespeare’s Tribe: Church, Nation, and Theater in Renaissance England(Universityof Chicago Press,2002) for an attempt to define Shakespeare’s own religious beliefs and to see EnglishRenaissance playwrights themselves“as a kind of ministry”whose plays were intended as“contribu-tions to the cause of true religion”(p.9) and“godly enterprises”(p.2), so that the theater became analternative to the prelatical church. For a critical response to Knapp, seeChapter11below, p.225.19For more on Catholic and Calvinist perspectives inHamlet, seeChapter1below.20For this tension, see MacCulloch,Later Reformation,p.5. Even the godly Elizabeth maintained thecrucifix and candles in her private chapel and preferred a formal, sung liturgy over an excess ofsermons: Felicity Heal,Reformation in Britain and Ireland(Oxford University Press,2003), p.361,andChapter3below, p.59. See alsoChapter2below, p.42. The liturgy of the Church of England wasmore elaborate than that of other churches in the Reformed world; it retained bishops, fullyfunctioning cathedrals, as well as deans, canons, paid choirs and organists, and a tendency to usethe English Prayer Book in a ceremonial way: Diarmaid MacCulloch,Christianity: The First ThreeThousand Years(New York: Viking,2009), p.649. See as well the scholarship cited in notes59and60ofChapter2below.6David Loewenstein and Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"(2.2.293).21That Hamlet Senior offers a Catholic perspective makes somesense in terms of the play’s representation of two generations (sincefirst-generation Protestants, after all, had Catholic parents); that his Ghostcomes from Purgatory also takes on a symbolic resonance in a dark andprotracted tragedy full of“foul crimes”(1.5.12) that often evokes the sense ofliving through a kind of Purgatory. The Christian prince whose outlook isshaped by reformed views, moreover, sees his world providentially (“There’sa divinity that shapes our ends”and“a special providence in the fall of asparrow”[5.2.10,157–8]).22However, Horatio’s concluding summary of thebloody revenge tragedy with its“accidental judgements”and“casual slaugh-ters”(5.2.324–8)offers another, more skeptical interpretation of the play’sevents–one in tension with providential explanations. Even withinHamletwe get competing, contradictory, and dissonant religious perspectives.Rather than encourage easy or simple resolutions to these conflictingperspectives, Shakespeare, it seems, aims in his imaginative ways to animate,and thereby to provoke readers and spectators to think about, the deepestmatters of religious belief and controversy.Yet if Shakespeare’s plays are permeated by references to early modernreligious matters, they nevertheless provide little evidence of his being acommitted religious writer with specific religious persuasions such as, say,Foxe, Spenser, Herbert, or Milton enunciate. In the absence of such specificallegiances, does this mean that he is ultimately a great secular writer, asmany twentieth-century critics liked to emphasize? The boundary ofteninvoked between the secular and the religious in the early modern period istoo simple and unhistorical, as Brian Cummings has powerfully and per-suasively reminded us.23One might consider Shakespeare’s Falstaff, forexample, as a great secular comicfigure with an agile and fertile imagination;yet his clever uses of Puritan cadences–“O, thou hast damnable iteration,and art indeed able to corrupt a saint...God forgive thee for it”(1Henry IV1.2.80–2), he tells Hal as he wittily justifies his vocation of stealing–complicate a simple binary between the secular and the religious. Suchlanguage reminds us that Shakespeare’s contemporary audiences–steeped21Citations from Shakespeare in the Introduction are taken fromThe Norton Shakespearebased on theOxford text and edited by Stephen Greenblatt, Walter Cohen, Jean E. Howard, and KatherineEisaman Maus (New York: W. W.

Even in Falstaff’s inventive festiveworld, religious and secular issues creatively intersect. As the chapters in thisvolume examine Shakespeare’s plays in relation to early modern religiousculture, they likewise highlight the unstable and porous division betweenthe two categories and eschew a narrative of secularization that placesShakespeare at its very center.This volume, moreover, explores Shakespeare’s imaginative and intellec-tual engagement with currents of early modern religious beliefs withoutreducing early modern religious experience to issues of power or politicalcontrol.25Hamlet’s anxious religious questing, including his ability toengage with doubts and uncertainties, for example, is symptomatic of hiscapacious, wide-ranging mind struggling with his profound sense of griefand acute sense of mortality; it cannot be confined to issues of power, evenas he despises the sinister politics and duplicity of the Danish court. Yet, atthe same time,Shakespeare and Early Modern Religiondoes at points con-sider ways that religious concerns in Shakespeare intersect with politicalones. This point of exchange allows Shakespeare to enrich religious andpolitical ambiguities in his plays. For instance, Shakespeare complicates anddeepens the character of Claudius inHamletby portraying him as anefficient and slippery Machiavellian politician who skillfully uses regallanguage at the court and yet who, in private, is also burdened with akeen sense of his“rank”offense which“hath the primal eldest curse upon’t”;consequently his guilty conscience cannot show genuine contrition as hissoul desperately struggles“to be free”:“O wretched state, O bosom black asdeath, / O limèd soul.../ Help, angels! Make assay!”(3.3.36–7,67–9).Or consider the case ofHenry V, which illustrates how Shakespearedramatizes interconnected issues of religion, politics, and militant nation-alism; the intertwining of these issues introduces different kinds of ethicaland political ambiguities. There religious language can be exploited to24For more about the antagonism between godly reformers and the stage, seeChapters1and3below.25Critics identifying as New Historicist or materialist are sometimes criticized for“reducing”thecomplexity of the plays to a single struggle between a dominant ideology and its (real or imagined)alternatives. As with any approach, such work ranges from the very rich to the reductive. Notableexamples of that work (e.g., the influential studies of Shakespeare by Stephen Greenblatt) would notbe out of place in a collection like ours.8David Loewenstein and Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"justify dubious claims to wage war in the name of national interests. WhenHenry V, a Catholic king whose chauvinistic national politics would haveresonated in Protestant England, asks whether he has a justcasus belliso thathe can wage war against France, the Duke of Canterbury addresses theking’s concern about“right and conscience,”while fueling the zeal for warand national unity by invoking biblical authority (Numbers27:8; see1.2.96–114). In his vehement and skillful oratory, Henry V himself linksvengeance and“the will of God”(1.2.189) as he justifies his nationalisticcampaign against France. Even when the English Army seems enfeebledbefore the great battle of Agincourt, Henry asserts:“We are in God’s hand”(3.6.155). And when the French suffer a spectacular defeat, Henry declares,“God, thy arm was here”(4.8.100) and calls for“all holy rites”(4.8.100,116).Henry V’s religious language is an instrument of his political and nationalambitions, but is it also more than that? Shakespeare leaves the answer tothis question unresolved, allowing for interpretive instabilities and ambi-guities: we can see the ruthless, immoral uses of religion for militant politicalpurposes and yet acknowledge that on some level the warlike and rhetori-cally skillful Henry is indeed a religious man whose chauvinistic leadershipand pursuit of national unity the play enables us both to admire andquestion. InShakespeare and Early Modern Religion, the chapters byBeatrice Groves, Peter Lake, Adrian Streete, Paul Stevens, and MichaelDavies (to mention several contributions) also examine ways that religion,politics, and issues of national identity interact in other plays byShakespeare, thereby generating ethical and political ambiguities.IIFor several decades literary critics have approached religion as a culturalactivity that shares with imaginative literature a set of common symbols,concepts, and interpretive strategies. This yoking of the domains offictionand religion, most apparent in work on the early modern stage, was givenparticular impetus by New Historicist critics, who argued that symbolicactivities of all kinds might be included in our notion of culture, and thatpurely“literary”or“theatrical”uses of language could not be restricted toimaginative writing.26Over the last several decades a number of critics haveproduced powerful interpretations of Shakespearean and early moderntheatrical texts, identifying key concepts–conversion, dissimulation,26The most influential articulation of this wider scope is Stephen Greenblatt’sRenaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare(1980; University of Chicago Press,2005).Introduction9"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"dispossession, idolatry, and imitation–that place the basic operations ofplaying and theatrical“feigning”on the fault lines of larger sectariandebates.27After the New Historicism brought an anthropological approach tothinking about religion, later approaches moved further afield into philos-ophy, contemporary cultural history, and the history of the book.Contributors to a notable collection of essays edited by Ken Jackson andArthur Marotti, for example, have brought phenomenological and post-modern perspectives to the question of how religion or religious conflict isexpressed in Shakespeare’s plays.28Renewed interest in social, intellectual,and book history, as well as modern language philosophy, has introducedadditional perspectives on the religious impulses and diverse religioustraditions that seem to animate Shakespeare’s plays.29The chapters in this collection do not always represent a departure, ineither direction or method, from this important body of preceding scholarlywork, although our contributors tend to employ historicist rather thanpostmodern critical methods. Readers will, however,find a subtle shift ofemphasis that is due–in part–to the context of the discussion, but also tothe kinds of thinkers and critics that are part of the ongoing discussionabout Shakespeare and early modern religion. We have already stressed thefact that several historians of religion contribute chapters to the volume,providing complex historical and cultural perspectives on the tensions andalignments that characterized the times in which Shakespeare lived andwrote. As a result, the texture of argument in this volume is at times moregranular, more likely to recognize eddies and cross-currents in early modern27See Stephen Greenblatt,“Shakespeare and the Exorcists,”inShakespearean Negotiations(Berkeley,CA: University of California Press,1988), ch.4; andHamlet in Purgatory(Princeton University Press,2002); Deborah Kuller Shuger,Political Theologies in Shakespeare’s England: The Sacred and the Statein“Measure for Measure”(Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan,2001); Jeffrey Knapp,Preachers andPlayers in Shakespeare’s England(Berkeley, CA: Center for Hermeneutical Studies,1995).28Ken Jackson and Arthur F.

The chapters herein examine notonly Shakespeare’s creative engagement with the diverse“religious culture”in the early modern period; they also examine Shakespeare as a kind ofreligious thinker, albeit one who works in the imaginative medium ofdrama. Many of the contributors in this collection emphasize the complex-ity of Shakespeare’s engagement with conflicts that were debated by pro-fessional theologians during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries,but which also touched intimately the lives of individuals for whom con-fession was a defining force. That complexity–encouraged, perhaps, by an“imaginary”or provisional art form such as drama–is at odds with the morecontrolled nature of theological debate (focusing on concepts) or theagonism of outright sectarian conflict (in, say, controversial print literature).If Shakespeare participated in the religious culture of which he was a part,then his mode of participation may have been to compose rich and nuancedplays that provoke his audience and readersto thinkin a more open-mindedway about religious issues–including religious disputes, ambiguities, andcontradictions stimulated by the upheavals of the protracted Reformation–rather than nail things down. The Anglo-Saxon word“thought”sits somedistance away from classical words like“concept,”“idea,”“theology,”oreven“culture.”One can think about something without necessary resolvingit; one can try out a perspective by“thinking”about it, even if one neverfully occupies or adopts it.This second shift in emphasis may in the end be the more important one.Contributors to this volume provide a rich picture of a playwright trying outscenarios and conflicts that in more polemical or academic circles might becalled notions or beliefs. Thatflexibility is important, since it allows fordiscussion of Shakespeare’s connection to early modern religious life that isnot overly structured by, or aligned with, the kind of position-taking that isso common during the period. As A. D. Nuttall seems to have recognized inhis book,Shakespeare the Thinker, there is something noticeably intransitiveabout thought and thinking: they do not always issue in something likeaction, and do not always show their effects in concrete position-taking.30As editors, we see the analyses in this volume unfolding in what thegrammarian might call the“middle voice,”a mood that suggests thatShakespeare was neither completely active, nor completely passive, in the30A. D. Nuttall,Shakespeare the Thinker(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press,2007).Introduction11"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"ways in which he took up and elaborated, in his own creative andindependent-minded way, the religious thinking of the early modernperiod. While this may seem like a small point, such a deliberately dynamicsense of Shakespeare’s engagement with the religious questions that almostevery early modern person had to confront makes it easier to bring theinsights of historians and literary critics together in a common discussion.Plays are not themselves thoughts. But they provoke thoughts, and thisthinking can be called religious–or economic, political, erotic, and so on.Shakespeare the dramatist, we suggest, was notably open-ended andflexiblein his religious thinking as he worked creatively in a multifaceted Protestantculture that not only destroyed but assimilated vestiges of its Catholic past.The chapters that follow thus provide a range of perspectives on whatconstitutes religious thinking in this period and how it is related, on theone hand, to the sectarian and religious conflicts studied by historians and,on the other, to the imaginative achievement that Shakespeare’s playsrepresent to literary critics and historians.IIIWe have divided the chapters into two complementary parts.Parti,“Revisiting Religious Contexts in Shakespeare’s England,”provides freshand interconnected assessments of the diversity of and tensions withinreligious culture in Shakespeare’s England, while assessing how we mightthink about religious diversity in relation to Shakespeare’s life and career.David Bevington reminds us of the challenges of attempting to define orcircumscribe Shakespeare’s own religious persuasions in the complex andchanging religious culture of England in the later sixteenth and earlyseventeenth centuries. Yet at the same time, he illuminates Shakespeare’sdistinctive and independent-minded representation of contentious religiousissues by reviewing evidence provided in the plays and by comparingShakespeare to such contemporaries as Jonson, Dekker, and Middleton.From these perspectives, Shakespeare emerges as less satirically sharp indramatizing anti-Puritan sentiment. England may have been strongly anti-Catholic during the period when Shakespeare was thriving as a playwright,but Bevington makes clear that Shakespeare does not always subscribe topredictable prejudices:King Johndoes not simply demonize the CatholicChurch; Shakespeare’s Henry V is a Catholic king who builds chantries;Hamletincludes both Catholic and Protestant perspectives, despite thedramatic tensions they may create; andHenry VIIItreats mildly Henry’sfirst queen, the Catholic Katherine of Aragon. Shylock the Jew is treated12David Loewenstein and Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"with pity, even asThe Merchant of Venicealso exposes the savagery of OldTestament cries for revenge; but then Christians, with their often vicioustreatment of Shylock (i.e., reviling him as a“misbeliever, cut-throat, dog”[1.3.107], and devil), do not always come offwell, as Shakespeare’s playdramatizes the contradictions between their Christian principles and theirbehavior. The Shakespeare portrayed by Bevington seems acutely aware ofthe religious divisions of his age and can address some of the strongestreligious prejudices and tensions within Protestant culture itself (especiallythose generated by hostility to Puritans). However, his lack of predictabilityand the more generous perspectives he sometimes offers of different reli-gious faiths are just some of the ways Shakespeare is distinctive in histreatment of early modern religious culture divided by faith and character-ized by diversity.Peter Marshall and Felicity Heal, historians of early modern religion,offer complementary accounts of the complexities of religious alignments inShakespeare’s England. Peter Marshall uses testimony from Warwickshireto examine the degree of debate and dispute over religion. As he shows, thisimpulse to discuss and debate in an animated way lay at“the heart of thereligious culture of Shakespeare’s age”(p.52). Marshall gives us a complexpicture of religious life in Shakespeare’s England: Protestant anxieties aboutCatholics along with day-to-day toleration that existed among neighbors ofdifferent faiths.31In the midst of all this debate in an age of confessionalchoices, Marshall stresses Shakespeare’s absence of“religious declarations.”He provides plenty of evidence for the diversity, conflicts, and“kaleido-scopic elements of religious culture”(pp.54–5) which Shakespeare was ableto draw upon and reanimate imaginatively in his plays. If Marshall providesboth a local (based on Warwickshire) and larger picture of complex religiousalignments, Felicity Heal focuses her attention on religious culture inLondon during Shakespeare’s years working in the metropolis. Her chapterilluminates the diverse and cacophonous world of religion in Shakespeare’sLondon: a world characterized by a multi-faceted Protestantism, a radicalPuritan underground, an underground Catholic community, and popularantipopery. In addition, London was a major center of preaching, not onlyat Paul’s Cross, but at other venues, including Westminster Abbey;32asHeal observes,“Shakespeare cannot have escaped hearing, and seeing, the31For more on these issues both in England and on the continent, see Kaplan,Divided by Faith.32For major studies of this topic, see Arnold Hunt,The Art of Hearing: English Preachers and theirAudiences,1590–1640(Cambridge University Press,2010); and Mary Morrissey,Politics and the Paul’sCross Sermons,1558–1642(Oxford University Press,2011).Introduction13"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"practice of religion in the metropolis”(p.60).33Together, the chapters byMarshall and Heal provide a concrete sense of the religious plurality andtensions which Shakespeare creatively drew upon in his plays, althoughwithout his engaging in a predictable, one-sided kind of Protestant prop-aganda (often with nationalist implications).The chapters inPartii,“Representing Religious Beliefs and Diversity inthe Plays,”then explore in detail how Shakespeare’s plays, written in a rangeof genres, engage with the religious diversity, alignments, and tensions of hisage. Alison Shell’s study ofA Midsummer Night’s Dreamshows howShakespeare evokes Reformation notions–notably idolatry, given theplay’s focus on dotage in love–and yet treats them in fresh ways that areboth playful and mischievous; in effect, Shakespeare’s comedy, as Shellelucidates, reworks Reformation-inflected anxieties about misdirected wor-ship. At the same time, Shell argues for a complex and ambivalent treatmentof Catholic nostalgia in the play in terms of its representations of fairies(given connections between popery and faery in the culture) sinceShakespeare’s fairies are specifically associated with indirection anddelusion.Shakespeare’s interest in the interactions between political and religiousrhetoric lies at the center of Beatrice Groves’s chapter onKing John; sheilluminates how, in thefirst half of Shakespeare’s career, he could write ahistory play that dramatizes both national identity and religious issues inpost-Armada England. She freshly examines how Josephus’account of thefall of Jerusalem was reinterpreted in Elizabethan England (including insiege-plays) before showing how the dramatically potent Bastard inKingJohnmanipulates, for his own Machiavellian and independent-mindedends, the siege and fall of Jerusalem and the Elizabethan emphasis onJewish unity. As Groves reveals, the play contains subversive elementswhich unsettle its patriotic rhetoric at the end; by inverting the Jerusalemtrope, the play challenges contemporary uses of religious and nationalisticpropaganda to reinforce the conformity of England’s subjects.Peter Lake’s chapter examines the relation between politics and religionfrom a different perspective: by considering ways the neo-Roman or repub-lican ideology ofJulius Caesaris tested by Christian sensibilities. QuentinSkinner’s major work on neo-Roman political thought concerning civil33Hamlin,Bible in Shakespeare, reviews the evidence for Shakespeare’s own attendance of churchservices, including in London (pp.13–14). Shakespeare may well have attended“hundreds of churchservices throughout his life”(evidence that he was highly familiar with biblical culture and the Book ofCommon Prayer); however, the precise nature and intensity of his personal religious beliefs remainselusive.14David Loewenstein and Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"liberty has given us a secular account of the early modern period by high-lighting classical republicanism and downplaying religious conflict andbeliefs as important political factors.34Yet as Lake shows, even inJuliusCaesarsecular and religious sensibilities interact, especially if interpretedfrom the providential perspective of Shakespeare’s contemporaries. Lakebegins by reading the tragedy in political terms as he explores the disastrousconsequences of applying republican thought and values (e.g., about honorand political virtue) to the very different political circumstances of Caesar’sRome. However, the play, although about pagan Romans, also operates onanother level that would have evoked providential culture for Shakespeare’sChristian contemporaries: its numerous references to prophecies, prodigies,and portents which are misconstrued by major characters in the play. LateElizabethans were anxious about the succession and the stability of thepolity; consequently, the monarchical and Christian world of1599com-bined with providential thinking, with its emphasis on heavenly admon-itions and judgments, would have shaped their responses to the play’sdepiction of republican conspiracy and its disastrous consequences.Adrian Streete’s contribution examines another kind of tension betweenearly modern religion and classical culture: the tension between Lucretianand Christian ethics and between Epicurean philosophy and Protestantismas manifested inMeasure for Measure. Streete considers, for thefirst time,the relation of a Protestant sensibility in the play (e.g., Angelo’s sternProtestant interpretation of the law) to its creative engagement withLucretius. As Streete emphasizes, Lucretian cosmology could seem shockingin the context of early modern Protestantism: the poet’s denial of provi-dence, his rejection of creationex nihilo, and his refutation of the immortal-ity of the soul posed a serious challenge to early modern religious cultureand writers (including Calvin). The competition between Protestant andLucretian sensibilities inMeasure for Measurenot only suggests the imper-fection of the Duke and Isabella’s plot in the play; it enables Shakespeare tochallenge the notion of a perfect account of natural law and recaptureLucretius as“a deeply ethical thinker”in the midst of Protestant culture.Questions of providence and early modern religious culture are likewisecentral to David Loewenstein’s chapter onKing Lear, which emphasizes thedaring and experimental side of Shakespeare when it comes to dramatizingextreme positions with regard to religious belief. Loewenstein arguesthat Shakespeare’s most devastating tragedy enabled him to imagine, in aculture steeped in providential thinking, a potentially agnostic perspective:34See, e.g., Quentin Skinner,Liberty Before Liberalism(Cambridge University Press,1998).Introduction15"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"a pre-Christian world in which there seems to be no supernatural inter-vention or guidance in human affairs, and no heavenly response to pro-tracted human calamity and misery. This tells us less about Shakespeare’sown personal religious allegiances (though a zealous Protestant playwrightwould likely not have written such an antiprovidential play), but rathermore about the freedom Shakespeare found in tragic theater to represent anextraordinary range of religious beliefs–some of them contradictory. EvenHamlet, as we noted above, can juxtapose a providential view of events(Hamlet’s) with one (Horatio’s at the end) which clashes with it.King Learmay be full of apocalyptic language and biblical allusions (e.g., to the Bookof Job), but it subverts a providential interpretation of events and offers aparticularly radical and skeptical view of any kind of religious order or wayof understanding an inhospitable and stark world of violence and savagerythat reduces“unaccommodated man”to“a poor, bare, forked animal”(3.4.98–100). Placed in the context of Shakespeare’s other plays, the tragedyunderscores the remarkable diversity of religious perspectives he representsand the freedom with which the theater enabled him to do so; these includethe deeply unsettling antiprovidential point of view dramatized inKing Lear.Ewan Fernie’s contribution considers the dark tragedy ofMacbethinrelation to the impact of the Reformation and its notions of human sinful-ness and the demonic. In particular, Fernie examines the sinfully degradedand blood-drenched Macbeth in terms of Luther’s notion of demonicnegativity. In the case of the demonic Macbeth, who becomes symbolicof an“abortive Protestantism,”there is no possibility of redemption.Nonetheless, as Fernie shows, there are exhilarating dimensions to“sinningbravely”inMacbeth. He illuminates how the dense poetry of the tragedyrenders distinctively–for example, by conveying creativity in destruction–the“terrible affirmation of demonic negativity that Luther seeks to admitand even magnify”(pp.190,182,188).Michael Witmore’s contribution adds another dimension to this volume:a study of Shakespeare and wisdom literature that engages with earlymodern religious culture but is not limited to it. His account of wisdomculture likewise reveals the extent to which cultural practices that are closelyaligned with religion or spirituality nevertheless reach beyond thosedomains. Witmore examines how Shakespeare works and thinks prover-bially in his plays; this involves not only engaging with a culture in whichcollections of proverbs were pervasive, but also understanding howShakespeare draws creatively and theatrically on the practices of lotteriesand bibliomancy–the art of seeking advice by randomly opening a book,16David Loewenstein and Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"including the Bible. By associating wisdom culture with these practices, heoffers new readings ofThe Merchant of Veniceand the perverse love test inKing Lear(which can be understood in light of the lottery in Numbers26).Witmore further considers the implications of seeing Shakespeare’s plays interms of a kind of wisdom literature, suggesting that plays with proverbialtitles (up toHenry VIII, with the alternative or even original title,All IsTrue) may themselves have been advertised as a kind of lottery. Throughoutthis analysis, Witmore argues that the plays show Shakespeare engaged withand testing the practices of early modern wisdom culture in rich andsometimes unexpected ways.Richard McCoy’s chapter turns to the romances, especiallyThe Winter’sTale, to examine the deep affinities, as well as the differences, betweenpoetic and religious faith. As he makes the case for their deep affinities, hedraws upon Coleridge’s insights into the parallels between religious andpoetic faith and reviews Reformation interpretations of the Eucharist,including the ways English reformers understood the sacrament’s semioticefficacy. Moreover, he stresses the ways Shakespeare’s theater itself cultivatessome of the same responses encouraged by Reformed religion: the plays“awaken a faith that requires strenuous effort, good will, and a will tobelieve”(p.225). Yet when he shifts his critical attention toThe Winter’sTale, particularly its movingfinal scene, McCoy illuminates ways in whichpoetic faith can differ from religious belief in Shakespeare’s plays so that ourfaith ultimately lies in the power of theatrical illusion and spectacle. As such,his chapter offers another contribution to the complex relations between thereligious and the secular in Shakespeare’s theater.Paul Stevens’s contribution, which includes discussions ofHamletandHenry VIII, likewise revisits the relation between these categories, challeng-ing critical tendencies to secularize Shakespeare’s theater, and focusinginstead on a“post-secular perspective”that complicates the two categoriesand the ways they interact. Stevens questions the critical tendency to insiston a secular interpretation ofHamlet(despite the play’s wealth of biblicalreferences) and deepens his argument against secularizing narratives byemphasizing howHenry VIII, at the end of Shakespeare’s career, enablesthe playwright to dramatize–in its pageant-like and ceremonial accounts oftragic falls and the story of the“chosen”(5.4.48) Elizabeth’s birth–thesustaining presence of God’s grace in the story of England. He explores thiscrucial dimension of the play by analyzing its evocations of Scripture(especially Job and the Psalms) and its liturgical features (which drawupon the Book of Common Prayer). Finally, by examining Jane Austen’sdiscerning response to the play inMansfield Park, Stevens is able toIntroduction17"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"expand his series of interconnected critical reflections about Shakespeareanindividualism, the post-secular, and the force of grace or“the grace oftruth.”By looking especially at the perplexing origins of the HenricianReformation in relation to the king’s divorce, Michael Davies providesanother critical perspective on the issue of historical“truth”inHenryVIII. Davies’s in-depth discussion of the language of Henry VIII’s con-version account in Act2, scene4of Shakespeare’s play opens out into amuch broader discussion of the complex relation of history to“truth.”Davies illuminates how Shakespeare gives a fresh dramatic representationto ambivalent views about Henry VIII and the question of his“conscience.”He challenges the view that Shakespeare follows Catholic histories andshows instead how the TudorChroniclesof Stow and Holinshed encourageda Protestant tradition of ambivalence about Henry’s conscience.Shakespeare animates this ambivalence in his historical drama. Questionsabout the“facts”of Henry’s divorce and the beginnings of the HenricianReformation thereby remain unresolved. Davies reveals a Shakespeare“remarkably attuned to contemporary discourses of early modern religion”(p.279), while also provoking his audience and readers to think about theambiguities and uncertainties of“truth”in relation to history.Thefinal chapterin this volume, by Matthew Dimmock, takes the readerin another direction, one already partly anticipated in David Bevington’sopening chapter. How does Shakespeare represent non-Christian religions,notably Judaism and Islam, and to what degree do his plays reveal toleranceor hostility toward them? Dimmock addresses the question by situatingShakespeare in his contemporary theatrical context so that it becomesclearer how Shakespeare imitated, revised, or rejected early modern repre-sentations of non-Christian religions. Comparing Shakespeare withMarlowe, he highlights how religious divisions inThe Merchant of Veniceare less distinct, at least on the basis of faith. Nonetheless, Shakespeare’ssophisticated representation of Judaism suggests that it is not a viablealternative to Christianity; nor is it simply treated satirically as Marlowepresents it in the more theologically divided world ofThe Jew of Malta,where Old and New Testament theology are sharply opposed. Given theearly modern Islamic–Christian conflict, it is notable, as Dimmock goes onto argue, that Shakespeare never wrote a“Turk play,”even if there arenumerous references to Turks in his plays. Yet Islam and Mahomet receivelittle attention in his plays and Shakespeare makes no attempt to link–contemptuously and crudely in the manner of his contemporaries–Islamand Judaism. There is no deep theological engagement with Islam in his18David Loewenstein and Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"plays, suggesting that Shakespeare steers away from the theatrical bombastthat often characterized contemporary depictions of non-Christian religion.This may not indicate tolerance on Shakespeare’s part, but it does indicate areluctance to promote predictable theatrical stereotypes about Islam. Whenit comes to the two Abrahamic non-Christian religions, then, Shakespeareprovokes nuanced responses that complicate or resist stereotypes: his mostfamous Jew is both deeply humane and unrelentingly vengeful. However,there is no spokesperson for Islam or Mahomet in his plays, an absence thatmay suggest–in a different way–Shakespeare’s independence of mindwhen it comes to the issue of non-Christian religious difference.The range of approaches and contributions outlined here will suggestthatShakespeare and Early Modern Religionaims to convey the independent-minded andflexible way in which this playwright engages–throughout hiscareer–with early modern religious culture in all its diversity and messiness.This is not to say that Shakespeare is unconstrained imaginatively by thereligious conflicts, beliefs, and confessional positions he chooses to presentin his plays. Rather, we hope that this collection shows just how diversethose religious currents are, and consequently, how complex and nuancedShakespeare’s representation of those currents would have to be in order totake their full measure in drama. If this emphasis provokes more criticalthinking and debate about Shakespeare and religion, then this cross-disciplinary book will have achieved its principal goals.Introduction19"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"part iRevisiting religious contextsin Shakespeare’s England"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"chapter 1The debate about Shakespeare and religionDavid BevingtonCan one talk about Shakespeare’s religious thought? He is of course adramatist, and a great one, but drama is not for him primarily a vehiclefor propounding moral, religious, and ethical values. He is seeminglycontent to let other writers, like Ben Jonson, pursue overtly didacticpurposes. To be sure, Shakespeare is interested in the art of persuasion,but as an observer rather than as a partisan. He habitually lets his charactersspeak for themselves, to such an extent that we must always be careful not toascribe to the author the views thus expressed. Shakespeare practices whatJohn Keats, in a letter to his brother Thomas (December17,1817), aptlyterms Shakespeare’s“negative capability,”a term that embraces, amongother features, his ability to let contending voices argue their opposing viewswithout prejudging the case or using the debate to prove his own point.Does he see the deposition of King Richard II as a deplorable impiety or aspart of a large historical movement toward strong monarchical rule? Does heside with Hotspur, or King Henry IV, or Prince Hal, or Falstafffor thatmatter, in defending or critiquing honor? Does he tip his hand as to what hisown religious persuasions were? Does biographical information about himprovide any clues?No issue was more controversial in Renaissance Europe and Englandthan that of religion. It was a subject on which Shakespeare’s audience at theGlobe Theatre presumably had strong feelings, tending to the Protestantand at times Puritan side. The Puritans, though wary of drama generally aspotentially idolatrous and profane, nevertheless were at times ready to makeexceptions for plays that promoted godliness, as in the Calvinist-inspiredmorality plays of the mid sixteenth century and afterwards with titles likeThe Longer Thou Livest the More Fool Thou ArtandEnough Is as Good as aFeast.1Drama during the Marian Catholic regime of1553–8had rallied to1See Paul Whitfield White,Theatre and Reformation: Protestantism, Patronage, and Playing in TudorEngland(Cambridge University Press,1993).23"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the Catholic cause, simply by casting their morality-play villains asProtestants. Conversely, in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, playwrights wereenlisted to write for the Protestant cause. The Queen’s Men, a touringcompany made up, on the authority of the queen, with some of thefinestand best-known actors (Richard Tarlton among them) in England at thetime, staged such plays asThe Famous Victories of Henry V,King Leir, andThe True Tragedy of Richard III. These plays were of course written to beentertaining, but a didactic purpose was also plentifully discernible: that ofdefending the Protestant Reformation and England’s queen againstCatholic enemies abroad and at home.Yet the reformers grew increasingly disillusioned with the London the-ater in the1590s and afterwards as it rapidly escaped official control andturned to satiric portraiture of the city and its inhabitants, many of themPuritan-leaning, like Marjorie, the wife of Simon Eyre in Thomas Dekker’sShoemaker’s Holiday(1599). Dekker’s satire is good-natured, and nominallyat least the play celebrates the rise to power of the mercantile class within thecity; but Dekker’s delight in laughing at London foibles of every stripe isquite far from the unashamed apologetics of Thomas Heywood’sThe FourPrentices of Londonin the1590sorThe Second Part of If, You Know Not Me,You Know Nobody, with the Building of the Royal Exchange, and the FamousVictory of Queen Elizabeth(1606). The growing antagonism betweenreformers and stage grew more acute as the boys’companies, having beensuppressed throughout most of the1590s because of their satirical bent, wereallowed to resume playing at the Blackfriars and then at other indoortheaters in1599and afterwards. Ben Jonson savagely satirized Puritansanctimoniousness and hypocrisy in his Tribulation Wholesome andAnanias inThe Alchemist(1610) and Zeal-of-the-Land Busy inBartholomew Fair(1614). Dekker took up the cry. So did ThomasMiddleton in his satirical comedy variously calledThe Puritan WidoworThe Puritan or The Widow of Watling Street, staged by the Children of Paul’sin1606. The moderate Puritan William Crashaw, preaching at Paul’s Crossin1607, inveighed against this play along with other“ungodly plays andinterludes”for their unfair indictment of the godly as hypocrites.Puritan animus against theater was thus of long standing and of increas-ing intensity. Thomas White had preached at Paul’s Cross in1577againsttheatrical performances as the ultimate cause of plague because the players’idolatrous carryings-on invited the wrath of the Almighty. StephenGosson’sPlayes Confuted in Five Actions(1582) inveighed against plays as“the invention of the devil, the offerings of idolatry, the pomp of worldlings,the blossoms of vanity, the root of apostasy, food of iniquity, riot, and24David Bevington"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"adultery”(sig. G8r). When Christopher Marlowe died in a tavern brawl in1593, Puritan preachers made no attempt to repress their jubilation at thismanifest sign of divine retribution for a life ill spent in the theater andelsewhere. Philip Stubbes’sThe Anatomy of Abuses(1583) kept up the litanyof complaints, as did William Prynne’sHistriomastix: The Players’Scourge orActors’Tragedy(1633). The closing of the theaters in1642was the predictableresult of a deep-rooted animosity. The London authorities, often tendingtoward Puritanism and troubled too that the playhouses attracted prosti-tutes and other riff-raff, used outbreaks of plague as a major reason forclosing down the public theaters in London as often as they could.Where is Shakespeare in all this hubbub about Puritans and the stage?Uncharacteristically for a playwright who is so generally even-handed andunwilling to engage in polemicism, he does leave some evidence in his playsof concern about the Puritans and their presumed animus against festivals,church ales, and other forms of Carnival merrymaking, including drama.His most notable comment is inTwelfth Night.When Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Feste have awakened a wrathfulMalvolio by their carousing late into the night in the Countess Olivia’shouse, Malvolio and Sir Toby echo in their heated exchange the language ofcontroversy over festive entertainment.“Do ye make an ale-house of mylady’s house?”demands Malvolio, to which Sir Toby offers his superb andmemorable riposte:“Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shallbe no more cakes and ale?”(2.3.88–115).2In medieval and RenaissanceEngland, the institution known as the“church ale”was a subject of muchdebate. Originally a commemoration of the dedication of a church build-ing, the church ale had become a much-loved festive gathering in parishchurches, with plentiful food and wine and entertainment. Attempts byTudor Protestant governments, beginning under Henry VIII in1536,toregulate church ales by restricting their occurrence to a certain day or daysrather than any time in the year met with determined resistance. ThePuritans tended to look on church ales as part of an older pre-Protestantorder of things in need of reform. Sir Toby lines up on the side of MerryOld England in its battle against the unsmiling disapproval of the reformers.Once Malvolio has left the scene of revelry in Act2, scene3, Maria–whose sympathies are with the revelers even though she has done her best toquiet things down–comes up with a plan of comic revenge. She will“gullhim [Malvolio] into a nayword and make him a common recreation”by2Shakespeare citations are from David Bevington (ed.),The Complete Works of Shakespeare,7th edn.(New York: Pearson/Longman,2014).The debate about Shakespeare and religion25"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"devising a letter that will deceive Malvolio into thinking that he has won theheart of Olivia. Maria wishes to humiliate Malvolio, she declares, because heis“a kind of Puritan.”Sir Andrew responds instantly with an outburst ofrevulsion:“Oh, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog”(2.3.139–41). SirAndrew lamely cannot explain his reason for this, but the animus is plainenough; later in the play, Sir Andrew expostulates,“I had as lief be aBrownist as a politician”(4.3.30–1), referring contemptuously to the con-gregationalist followers of Robert Browne, who had been expelled to theNetherlands in1581for their uncompromising severity in matters of churchceremony and other vitriolic dissatisfactions with the established church. SirAndrew may be following the popular line of conflating the Brownists withthe more radical Anabaptists.3His testiness in Act2, scene3, at any rate,elicits from Maria a decidedly more moderate attempt to rephrase andqualify her objection to Malvolio:The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly, but a time-pleaser; anaffectioned ass, that cons state without book and utters it by great swaths; thebest persuaded of himself, so crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies that itis his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice inhim will my revengefind notable cause to work. (2.3.146–52)Maria is careful not to condemn all Puritans outright by identifying themwith Malvolio. After all, some Puritan-leaning citizens did attend publicperformances of plays in London until the atmosphere in the playhousesproved too unwelcoming. Maria’s point, seemingly, is that Puritans are tobe regarded as the enemy only to the extent that they behave like Malvolio,arrogating to themselves the role of moral policemen. The issue is notPuritanism as such but the behavior of certain officious killjoys.Maria’s position, then, is thoughtful and moderate, albeit on the side ofinnocent merrymaking. Is this Shakespeare’s view also? Maria is a notablysympathetic character. Moreover, her wariness of Puritanism seems con-firmed by occasional allusions elsewhere in Shakespeare’s writings. The foolLavatch inAll’s Well That Ends Wellcompares“young Charbon thePuritan”with“Old Paysam the papist,”seeing in them a meeting ofopposites that is so often the case when extremes meet; though“their hearts3Peter Lake argues that Puritanism of the1590s was not essentially radical, though it manifested apotential for both subversion and orthodoxy; seeModerate Puritans and the Elizabethan Church(Cambridge University Press,1982) andProtestantism and the National Church in Sixteenth-CenturyEngland, ed.

The ClowninA Winter’s Talejibes at immigrant psalm-singing Puritan weavers fromthe Netherlands when he observes that the“one Puritan”at the sheep-shearing festival of that play“sings psalms to hornpipes”(4.3.43–5). TheBawd inPericlescomplains of the invincibly virtuous Marina, whom he istrying to sell into prostitution, that“she would make a Puritan of the devil ifhe should cheapen a kiss of her”(4.6.9–10). Falstaffmimics Puritan caden-ces when he mockingly protests to Prince Hal,“now am I, if a man shouldspeak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life,and I will give it over”(1Henry IV,1.2.92–5). These slighting allusions toPuritanism here and there in the canon are perhaps all the more telling forbeing so unstudied. Puritanism in Shakespeare is invariably the subject of ajest, even if Maria does go on to explain more carefully what she has meantby calling Malvolio a Puritan.Malvolio is arguably Puritan-like in the zeal with which he can torture atext to make it yield up a meaning that will serve his purposes.“M. O. A. I.,”he ponders, as he reads Maria’s forged letter.“If I could make that resemblesomething in me! Softly!‘M. O. A. I.’–.”When the letters do not seem tofollow the order of his name precisely, sinceOfollowsMwhere he wouldexpectA, Malvolio has a strategy to meet the crisis.“And yet, to crush this alittle,”he says,“it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in myname.”Indeed they are all there, in a word game so ingeniously devised thatthefirst letter is followed by the last in his name, and then the second andthe next to last. Malvolio triumphs in his discovery, like a reformer deter-mined to discover all of world history in the Scriptures.“Daylight andchampaign discovers not more!”he exults.“This is open”(2.5.118–57). YetMalvolio is not a Puritan doctrinally. What Maria calls Malvolio’s“groundsof faith”(2.3.150), using a favorite phrase of the Puritans, are not spiritualbut an unshakable belief in his own superiority to the rank andfile ofhumankind.Malvolio’s preference for“sad and civil”garb (3.4.5) is suggestive ofPuritan insistence on plain dress. The business of tricking him into wearingcross-garters and yellow stockings is not only an appropriate satirical pun-ishment for one who dresses severely and reproves those who do not; it isalso a comic reversal of appearance and reality, madness and sanity, of whichthe play is so full. Malvolio is tricked into becoming the very smilingchurch-ale reveler that he so abhors. These inversions take visible form onThe debate about Shakespeare and religion27"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"stage when Malvolio is incarcerated in a dark room as a madman, while thefool Feste, in a clerical gown and false beard, disguises his voice to counter-feit Sir Topas the curate, reproving Malvolio as a“hypocriticalfiend”and“dishonest Satan”for his benighted opinions about Pythagoras and such.The distraught Malvolio is driven at last to plead with Feste,“I am as well inmy wits, Fool, as thou art”(4.2.29–58).Malvolio’s departure from the scene of general reconciliation in Act5hasstruck many observers as perhaps the strongest suggestion of anti-Puritansentiment inTwelfth Night. Malvolio will have nothing to do with attemptsto mollify his fury.“I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you!”he shouts ashe storms off(5.1.378). Is this, as C. L. Barber imagines, a premonition of thePuritans’closing of the theaters in1642?4Shakespeare and his companycannot have predicted that outcome, of course, nor was it historically anymore inevitable than the civil war itself, but the Lord Chamberlain’s Menand their spectators certainly had reason to worry, in1600or thereabouts,that the reformers were not through with insisting on a ban of“profane”theatrical performances.Characteristically, Shakespeare depicts the confrontation as one that callsfor calm and accommodation.“He hath been most notoriously abused,”declares the Countess Olivia as Malvolio strides away, presumably never toreturn. She offers to chastise the perpetrators of a“revenge”that has gonetoo far. Shakespeare’s depiction of a ridiculousfigure with certain Puritan-like characteristics is far more gentle and generous than the attacks mountedby Jonson, Dekker, and Middleton, among others. It is as thoughShakespeare and his company wished to alert Londoners to the threat totheater posed by the reform-minded civic leaders of the city while at thesame time holding out an olive branch to the reformers. Yet the hour wasalready late. English drama in the next three decades was to become moreand more oriented to the court and to the so-called“private”theaters, withtheir severely reduced capacity of audience size, while the culturally hetero-geneous audiences who had jubilantly supported one of the most remark-able phases in all dramatic history dwindled into a shadow of their formerselves.Shakespeare’s seeming wariness of Puritanism, then, was not doctrinal somuch as it was an antipathy toward any who claimed a higher moral groundfrom which to censor and repress forms of social recreation like theater. Canwe discern his thoughts and feelings about the bitter controversy between4C. L.

The standard view has assumed that he con-formed to the state religion, whatever his own skeptical thoughts may havesuggested to him. Conversely, the argument persists that he harboredCatholic sympathies. An international gathering of scholars at a conferenceat the University of Lancaster in the summer of1999examined at length thetheory that Shakespeare may have spent time in1580or so, when he wasaged16, at Hoghton Tower in Lancashire, a country estate where, appro-priately enough, the1999conference was held. According to RichardWilson, the conference organizer, Shakespeare had been right there atHoghton Tower in about1580, in the company of the Jesuit priestEdmund Campion, at the start of what was for Shakespeare a period ofsome ten years in a succession of Catholic households in that part ofEngland.5The idea thus provides a hypothetical scenario for the undocu-mented years of Shakespeare’s life from his marriage in1582and the births ofhis three children in1583–5down to his being mentioned as a playwright inLondon in1592.John Aubrey reports anecdotally in hisBrief Lives(written in the lateseventeenth century, though not published until1898), with the theatricalmanager John Beeston as his authority,“Though, as Ben Jonson says of him[Shakespeare], that he had but little Latin and less Greek, he understoodLatin pretty well, for he had been in his younger years a schoolmaster in thecountry.”6Samuel Schoenbaum adds that though Shakespeare’s lack ofuniversity training would have disqualified him for a mastership in agrammar school, he might have been employed in“the humbler post ofusher orabecedarius.”7Wilson and others propose instead that Shakespeareis to be identified with the“William Shakshafte”who is named in the will ofAlexander Hoghton (or Houghton) of Lancashire and is recommended toHoghton’s half-brother Thomas, or to a friend, Thomas Hesketh, for futureemployment.8Secret Catholics often adopted aliases to hide their identity,argues Wilson, and Shakespeare had good reason to be circumspect. Theschool he presumably attended in Stratford-upon-Avon gave the post ofschoolmaster from1579to1581to John Cottam, from Lancashire, whoseyounger brother Thomas, a Jesuit priest, was arrested in1580on a secret5See Richard Wilson,Secret Shakespeare: Studies in Theatre, Religion, and Resistance(ManchesterUniversity Press,2004).6John Aubrey,Brief Lives(London,1898), ed.

Another schoolmaster at the Stratford school,Simon Hunt, occupying the post from1571(when Shakespeare was7)to1575, went on to become a member of the Jesuit order at Douai and then atSt. Peter’s in Rome, where he succeeded Robert Parsons as English pen-itentiary. Might Cottam have recommended to William Hoghton a brightyoung scholar from a clandestinely Catholic family in Stratford to serve astutor in the Hoghton household? And are we to believe the statement of thelate seventeenth-century clergyman Richard Davies that Shakespeare“dieda papist”?9The devotees of this theory are generally persuaded that Shakespeare’sfather, John Shakespeare, was a Catholic. The most notable piece ofpurported evidence here is the so-called Borromeo testament, a spirituallast will and testament which appears to have been an English translation ofa document prepared by the Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal CarloBorromeo, to be carried in multiple copies into the countries of westernEurope by Jesuits to offer comfort to those wishing to die as faithfulCatholics. The document itself, stated in formulaic terms, offered anopportunity for the beleaguered Christian“to secure himself from thetemptations of the devil at the hour of death”by affixing his or hersignature.10A document of this sort was purportedly found in the eight-eenth century by a master builder, Joseph Moseley, in the rafters of a houseon Henley Street owned by the Hart family, who were descended fromShakespeare’s sister Joan. The will, containing fourteen articles of profes-sion to the Catholic faith, soon came into the hands of the reliquary JohnJordan, who in turn sent it to the great Shakespeare scholar EdmundMalone, who published it in1790but eventually recanted his endorsement,leaving Jordan to be accused of a forgery. The document itself is now lost,thus providing no opportunity now to study the authenticity of JohnShakespeare’s signature or mark. Still, Malone’s published transcriptshows that it was derived via translation from the Borromeo original.Against this argument for John Shakespeare’s purported Catholicismloom several considerations. The scenario itself, with thefinding of adocument in the rafters of a house in Stratford on Henley Street, hasaroused suspicions of being a fabricated romantic tale. We cannot verify9Richard Davies, in Fulman MS xv (Corpus Christi College, Oxford, MS309); reproduced photo-graphically in Schoenbaum,Documentary Life,p.79.10Carlo Borromeo, Cardinal and Archbishop of Milan,The Testament of the Souls.

We do know that as acivic official in Stratford, he was responsible on occasion for implementingthe decrees of the Elizabethan government, including the whitewashing anddefacing of a Last Judgment mural over the chancel arch in the town’s GuildChapel and another mural depicting Saint George’s victory over theDragon. In his role as chief alderman in1571he presumably concurredwith the decision of the town council to sell offall Catholic vestments in theinventory of the Guild Chapel. His beingfined in1576and afterwards fornonattendance at the Eucharist, once thought to be evidence of recusancy,now appears to have been a result of severefinancial difficulties obliging himto stay at home for fear of process of debt. His being allowed by theCorporation to remain on as alderman even in the midst of hisfinancialwoes would seem to suggest that he was regarded as an upstanding memberof the community and the official church. He and his wife Mary baptizedtheir children in Holy Trinity in Stratford, all of whom were buried there.Mary herself may have come from a family with Catholic connections.11Her father, Robert Arden, appears to have died in the faith in1556. PossiblyMary was related also to Edward Arden of Park Hall, who seems to haveprovided refuge for a Catholic priest, and whose son-in-law, JohnSomerville, was arrested in1583on suspicion of having plotted against thelife of Queen Elizabeth. Edward Arden was hanged, drawn, and quartered;his son-in-law was strangled in his cell in the Tower of London before asimilar sentence could be carried out on him. Both their heads weredisplayed on London Bridge as a warning to all would-be traitors andconspirators. To be sure, the connection of Mary’s family to these Ardensis uncertain, and the import of the language of her father’s testament hasbeen called into question as possibly formulaic; it reads like other willswritten during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary (1553–8). In any case,evidence is lacking for Mary’s having held Catholic persuasions or havingshared them with her husband in their family life in Stratford.Stephen Greenblatt speculates that religious differences may have been asource of contention between Shakespeare and his father, with the sonskeptically on his way to becoming neither Catholic nor Protestant, whilethe father, wishing to keep his options open in an era when the battlebetween Catholicism and Protestantism in England veeredfirst one way11See, among others, Germaine Greer,Shakespeare’s Wife(London: Bloomsbury,2007);Katherine Duncan-Jones,Ungentle Shakespeare: Scenes from his Life, Arden Shakespeare (London:Bloomsbury,2001); Park Honan,Shakespeare: A Life(Oxford University Press,1998); Stanley Wells,Shakespeare for All Time(Oxford University Press,2003); and René Weis,Shakespeare Revealed: ABiography(London: John Murray,2007).The debate about Shakespeare and religion31"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"and then the other, outwardly conformed to the new religion while wor-shipping in secret the faith of his ancestors.12This idea is fanciful, to be sure,but it does provide an intriguing interpretation of Hamlet’s encounter withhis father’s Ghost on the battlements of Elsinore Castle. Shakespeare’sfather died in1601, close to the time when Shakespeare wroteHamlet;which event camefirst is hard to say, but the father could have been ill ornear death in any case. In1596Shakespeare had applied for a coat of arms forhis father–the same year in which Shakespeare’s only son and heir,Hamnet, had unexpectedly died. Do these personal circumstances encour-age an autobiographical reading ofHamlet? Did the son’s name, Hamnet,take on for the dramatist a particular relevance when he chose to write a playnamedHamlet?Certainly the meeting of the father’s Ghost with his son would have beenladen with religious significance for London audiences in1600–1, attuned asthey were to sectarian conflict.“I am thy father’s spirit,”the Ghost tells hisson,“Doomed for a certain term to walk the night, / And for the dayconfined to fast infires, / Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature / Areburnt and purged away”(1.5.10–14). Audiences would recognize at once thatthe Ghost has come from Purgatory. Protestants in the sixteenth centuryhad rejected as Catholic superstition the idea of a place or state of punish-ment after death where the sins offlawed but worthy Christians would needto be purged before their souls could proceed to heavenly reward, but theidea was still an essential doctrine of Roman Catholic teaching. The Ghostdescribes himself as being in that state of needing purgation. The“foulcrimes”that he has committed during his days on earth, though imaginedby some critics to be his violent warlike menacing of Polacks andNorwegians (1.1.65–7), are doubtless instead the countless sins that allproud and covetous mortals commit in their daily lives.Hamletplainlyinvites its audience to admire Hamlet Senior’s warlike bravery; conversely,that audience would understand that in broadly Christian terms we are allsinners, and that a sudden death would leave any of us with a roster of sinsnot yet acknowledged or forgiven.The doctrine of Purgatory presumably was a controversial one forHamlet’s original audience. Hamlet Senior has died suddenly, havingbeen murdered in his sleep by his brother. He has had no time for confess-ing his sins. As the Ghost tells his son, he was“Cut offin the blossoms of mysin, / Unhousled, disappointed, unaneled, / No reck’ning made, but sent to12Stephen Greenblatt,Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare(New York:W. W. Norton,2004).32David Bevington"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"my account / With all my imperfections on my head”(1.5.76–80). Theterms he uses are those of Catholic liturgical practice: to die“Unhousled,disappointed, unaneled”is to die without having received the HolySacrament at the last moment. No priest was by to administer to HamletSenior the Last Rites of contrition, confession, satisfaction, and absolution.Protestants generally, in reducing the seven sacraments to two (Baptism andthe Eucharist, thus leaving out Confirmation, Penance, Holy Orders,Marriage, and Last Rites), denied the sacramental efficacy of the CatholicChurch’s prescribed ritual for a dying person. Contrition and confessionwere of course still vital to salvation, but not as a rite in which a clergymanwould pronounce individual absolution. The English Church, underArchbishop Cranmer, had established instead a Prayer of GeneralConfession, to be recited by a congregation in unison.13No Anglican priestsheard individual confession or assigned penances for sins.Hamlet’s encounter with his father’s Ghost, then, assumes a world ofCatholic faith and ritual. Why should it not, in dramatizing a tale ofmedieval Denmark? At the same time, Shakespeare chooses to presentHamlet as one who has studied at Wittenberg, famous in RenaissanceEurope for its university where Martin Luther had posted his95Thesesin1517in the opening salvo of the Protestant Reformation. Hamlet refers toHoratio as his“fellow student”(1.2.177), and we gather that their conversa-tions took up serious philosophical and religious questions. Moreover,Hamlet seems to have absorbed theological ideas that had been enunciatedby Martin Luther and John Calvin.“We are arrant knaves all, believe noneof us,”shouts Hamlet at Ophelia; though he considers himself“indifferenthonest,”that is, no worse than the run of ordinary Christians, he admits tobeing so“proud, revengeful, ambitious”that“it were better my mother hadnot borne me.”“What should such fellows as I do crawling between earthand heaven?”(3.1.122–30), he asks. When Polonius tells Hamlet that he willfind accommodations for the visiting players“according to their desert,”Hamletfires back,“God’s bodikin, man, much better. Use every man afterhis just desert, and who shall scape whipping?”(2.2.527–30). These aretruisms affirming the fallen state of the human race, to be sure, in theteachings of St. Augustine and other church fathers, but in RenaissanceEurope they were given new cogency by the reformers.The Calvinist bifurcation of humanity into the unregenerate and thesaved, according to the infinite and unknowable will of the Creator,13See Ramie Targoff,Common Prayer: The Language of Public Devotion in Early Modern England(University of Chicago Press,2001).The debate about Shakespeare and religion33"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"manifests itself starkly inHamletin the contrasting images of Claudius andHamlet Senior. As Hamlet says to his mother in her private chambers,upbraiding her for her loose behavior as he shows her portraits of the twomen she has married,“Look here upon this picture, and on this.”The one isa“mildewed ear, / Blasting his wholesome brother”(3.4.54–66). One is asatyr; the other Hyperion. One is reprobate, unable to help himself spiri-tually by doing what he knows he must do if he is to seek forgiveness.Claudius knows only too well that he must transform his life altogether bygiving up the worldly things for which he has committed fratricide, if he isto hope for pardon. Claudius knows that his prayers will not ascend toheaven because he is“still possessed / Of those effects for which I did themurder: / My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen”(3.3.36–71).Claudius realizes to his horror that, like Doctor Faustus, he cannot repentbecause he lacks the will to do so. He is one of the unregenerate.Conversely, Queen Gertrude, though a miserable sinner in Hamlet’seyes, is, as he appraises her, recoverable to virtue. His father’s Ghost seemsto think so too; he has told Hamlet to“leave her [Gertrude] to heaven / Andto those thorns that in her bosom lodge, / To prick and sting her”(1.5.86–8).Hamlet takes upon himself the role of stinging conscience, while promisingto himself and to us that he will“speak daggers to her, but use none”(3.2.395). He accosts her so roughly that she cries out in alarm, with theresult that Polonius is slain in his place of hiding, and the Ghost is soperturbed that he puts in an appearance to warn Hamlet about his“almostblunted purpose”(3.4.115), but Hamlet is in an important sense doing whathis father has ordered. Exhorting his mother in the cadences of a reformingpreacher, he issues his dire warnings:“Confess yourself to heaven, / Repentwhat’s past, avoid what is to come”(156–7). Though in Hamlet’s viewClaudius is unregenerate, Gertrude is not. As even the drunken Cassio inOthelloknows,“there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not besaved”(2.3.98–9).Roman Catholic theology and Calvinist theology stand side by side inHamlet, then, along with more broadly Christian ideas about the inherentdepravity of the human race. Yet the playwright seems more intent ondramatizing the differences than in promoting one side or the other. Is theplay Catholic or Calvinist in its perspective? One cannot say with certainty.We can agree, though, that Hamlet is devoutly Christian, more and more soas the play works its way toward a resolution that Hamlet interprets asprovidential.“There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,”he admonishesHoratio,“Rough-hew them as we will”(5.2.10–11). In retrospect, he seeseven the unfortunate death of Polonius as an integral part of Heaven’s34David Bevington"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"intent; Hamlet is to become, in the wake of that disaster, heaven’s“scourgeand minister,”punished for what he has done but at the same timebecoming an instrument of divine will in a way that he could not haveanticipated (3.4.180–2). Similarly, he sees heaven as“ordinant”in prompt-ing him how to outwit Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, his escorts toEngland, by exchanging his own letter to the English king for one byClaudius stipulating that Hamlet be executed (5.1.48–53). Hamlet exultsin his newly heightened awareness of the deep necessity of things.“There isspecial providence in the fall of a sparrow,”he insists to Horatio, when thatdear friend urges him to postpone the duel if the prospect seems ominous.“If it be now,’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be notnow, yet it will come. The readiness is all”(5.2.217–20). As Hamletinterprets his own story, this perception of the inevitability of things isborne out in what happens. The duel provides Hamlet with something hehas not planned and could not have foreseen: an opportunity to kill theKing essentially without premeditation and with a just cause, while at thesame time bringing to a close his own troubled life from which he hasfervently longed to be freed. Hamlet’s story is, in his own view, trium-phantly providential and Christian.Yet Horatio sees this same story in entirely different terms. Having been askeptic throughout the play, doubting the existence of the Ghost until hebeholds it with his own eyes, debating with Hamlet about natural versusprovidential explanations of things that happen, Horatio is prepared at lastto“speak to th’yet unknowing worldOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,And, in this upshot, purposes mistookFall’nonth’inventors’heads.(5.2.381,383–7)This is the secular humanist speaking, and it sorts well with the dramaticvoice inJulius Caesar,King Lear, and other tragedies of the Jacobean periodthat explore the daunting prospect of a world that is presided over not by abenign overseeing deity who makes sure that every smallest event in ourlives is ultimately meaningful, but by unforeseen accidents,“casual”vio-lence, and profound ironies in which human beings are too often theunwitting authors of their own unhappiness.1414ForJulius CaesarandKing Lear, seeChapters6and8below.The debate about Shakespeare and religion35"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Are we to readHamletfrom Hamlet’s own perspective, or that ofHoratio, or even that of Fortinbras, who perceives in the tragic events ofthe play a vindication of his claim to the Danish throne? Fortinbras is giventhe last word, after all. What we can say is that the playwright is fascinatedwith philosophical and religious controversy, among other matters, and notleast of all with skeptical uncertainty about the role purportedly played bydivinity in human affairs. Shakespeare shows that he is well versed in detailsof Roman Catholic liturgy and practice. He seems no less knowledgeableabout other current theologies, including Calvinism, and about skepticalphilosophy. Perhaps we should care less about whether Shakespeare wasCatholic or not, and pay more attention to the astuteness with which heuses theological issues of the day to construct a brilliant tragedy likeHamlet.Whatever his own private beliefs, Shakespeare is more generous andforbearing in his plays than many of his fellow dramatists in his depictionof Catholics.King Johnoffers a case in point.15It focuses not on issues ofMagna Carta (virtually ignored as an idea in Shakespeare’s day) but on John’swrongful occupation of the English throne and by his unsuccessful defianceof Rome. Essentially two views of King John (who reigned from1199to1216)were current in the English Renaissance. To some, he was a tyrant whodeprived his nephew, young Arthur, of his throne and life. To others,particularly those on the religious left, he was a precursor of those whowere to defy the Roman Church some three centuries later, even if his attemptto stand up to the authority of the papacy failed. John Foxe, in hisActes andMonuments of Martyrs(1583edition), known popularly asThe Book of Martyrs,championed the latter view of John as aflawed saint. This monumental andvividly illustrated book, with copies installed in English cathedral churches,16saw King John as an early martyr of Catholic oppression. He had beenportrayed in similar terms in the earlier play ofKing Johanby John Bale,and similarly in the anonymousThe Troublesome Reign of King John(pub-lished1591). Shakespeare’s representation of John is demonstrably more awareof his failings and less inclined to demonize the Catholic Church. InTroublesome Reign, for example, an entire scene is devoted to a conversationin which an abbot offers absolution to a friar for the“meritorious”deed ofpoisoning King John. Shakespeare mentions, briefly and matter-of-factly, therumor that the king has been poisoned by a monk, and leaves the matter at15For a more extensive discussion ofKing John, seeChapter5below.16Patrick Collinson,“Literature and the Church (‘The Era of Elizabeth and James VI’),”inDavid Loewenstein and Janel Mueller (eds.),The Cambridge History of Early Modern EnglishLiterature(Cambridge University Press,2002), pp.374–98.36David Bevington"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"that. Earlier, this same abbot is discovered inTroublesome Reignto be hidingnuns in his treasure chest. In Shakespeare, admittedly, Cardinal Pandulph is aduplicitous maneuverer in his plan to submit the English crown to Rome, butother statesmen are no less Machiavellian.Shakespeare’sHenry VIII(1613), written seemingly in collaboration withJohn Fletcher, deals mildly not only with the Catholic Church but especiallywith Katherine of Aragon, the daughter of Ferdinand II of Aragon and IsabellaI of Castile whose marriage to Henry VIII was annulled in1533,therebyprecipitating the break with Rome and the beginning of the EnglishReformation. Even though Fletcher evidently wrote parts of the play,Shakespeare is generally credited with having written the scene of the trial ofQueen Katherine (3.2), with its manifest sympathy for her at the expense ofher devious and skirt-chasing husband, and the scene of Katherine’sdeath(4.2), in which a heavenly vision of“spirits of peace”seems to assure her ascentinto eternal bliss. Katherine is charitable and submissive to the will of the Kingeven in her state of having been abandoned. In thefinal scene, writtenevidently by the Protestant John Fletcher but surely with Shakespeare’s assent,the birth of Elizabeth holds out the promise of a happy future to which theparticipants in this remarkable story have contributed. The play leaves indoubt the vexed question as to whether Katherine had previously beenlegitimately married to Henry VIII’s older brother Arthur, thereby implicitlychoosing not to endorse the Protestant view that herfirst marriage to Arthurhad in fact been consummated and that Henry was therefore free to annul hiscontract with Katherine. The play’s depiction of Anne Bullen (or Boleyn) isstudiously ambivalent; it suggests at moments that she was a pretty foxy younglady, but is nonetheless careful not to defame the mother of Queen Elizabeth.All in all, on the hot controversial issue of how the Reformation started inEngland, Shakespeare is circumspect and multiple in his sympathies.17Elsewhere, we see that he treats some Catholic clergymen with respectand even affection. Friar Laurence inRomeo and Julietis a kindly and well-meaning adviser to the young lovers, interested in their welfare and in theneed for restoring peaceful relationships between the two families.

The Abbess inThe Comedy of Errorsturns out to bethe devoted and long-lost wife of old Egeon.Some Catholic churchmen of high station in Shakespeare are cunningand unprincipled statesmen, like the Bishop of Winchester, later CardinalBeaufort, in1and2Henry VI, but so are his secular counterparts, the Dukesof Suffolk, Somerset, and York. Conversely, some members of the churchhierarchy in Shakespeare are principled and godly, like the Bishop ofCarlisle inRichard II. In theHenry IVplays, the Archbishop of York joinsthe rebellion against King Henry but does so on principled grounds; hisopposite number, Prince John of Lancaster, is the Machiavel who outwitsthe Archbishop and the rebel leaders with duplicitous promises.Shakespeare’s treatment of the religious question inHenry Vis as skillfulas it is tactful and generous. Henry is unquestionably a Catholic ruler, notsimply in that he came to the throne in1413well before the EnglishReformation, but also in his professions of faith at moments of crisis. Onthe night before the great Battle of Agincourt,1415, having talked incognitowith some of his captains and his soldiers, Henry prays. He prays that“thefault”that his father made“in compassing the crown”may not be heldagainst Henry himself, the son of that sin-burdened usurper. In his prayer,Henry V recites his efforts at seeking forgiveness. He has had Richard II’sbody reinterred with dignity and with“contrite tears.”More than that,Henry has set up an endowment at his own expense whereby“Five hundredpoor”are to raise up their withered hands in supplication“to pardonblood.”Most impressively of all, perhaps, Henry has“built / Two chantries,where the sad and solemn priests / Sing still for Richard’s soul”(4.1.287–300). Chantries were, in the eyes of Protestant reformers, an especiallyoffensive desecration perpetrated by the Roman Church, to be defacedand torn down. Yet Henry V is one of England’s greatest kings forShakespeare, as he is traditionally in England.Shakespeare makes no attempt to hide Henry’s devout Catholic ways. Atthe same time, the play depicts Henry as an absolute monarch who, however,also knows how to govern by consent. Henry V is thus the precursor ofEnglish monarchism at its very best, under Queen Elizabeth, in the implicitview of this patriotic play. The fact that Henry seeks forgiveness by doinggood works, such as building chantries and endowing church benefices, is notheld against him inHenry V. To be sure, Martin Luther would no doubt haveobjected that one cannot buy one’s way into heaven by doing good works ofthis kind, but King Henry is quick to agree with this Lutheran view aboutworks versus divine grace: though he has built two chantries, he acknowledgesthat“all that I can do is nothing worth, / Since that my penitence comes after38David Bevington"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"all, / Imploring pardon”(4.1.301–3). He is Catholic in his royalty andProtestant in his theology, just as he is an absolute monarch with thedemocratic touch. The play, in these terms, implicitly makes the case for anaccommodating and inclusive political-religious agenda in England at thetroubled moment of Elizabeth’s presumably last days as monarch.Shakespeare’s representation of Jews is much like his treatment ofChristians in showing a marked degree of tolerance and accommodationwhen we compare his writings with those of other dramatists. Marlowe’sThe Jew of Malta(c.1589) depicts its centralfigure, Barabas, as virulent in hishatred of Christians and increasingly deadly in his cunning, even if he isgiven some reason for his animus and feigned eloquence in his protestsagainst persecution. Shylock, by contrast, is a man who deserves pity andunderstanding, even if he is intent on obtaining his pound offlesh from thebreast of Antonio. To be sure, the ideals of Christianity (however poorlypracticed by some of its adherents in this play) seem to embody a highervision of generosity and risk for friendship than the grudging warinesspracticed by Shylock the moneylender and overly protective father.Elsewhere, too, Shakespeare’smoreoffhand references to Jews andJudaism seem to betray a substratum of ethnic bias.“If I do not love her, Iam a Jew,”says Benedick of Beatrice inMuch Ado About Nothing,using“Jew”as an epithet for one who cannot love generously. When Lance, inThe TwoGentlemen of Verona, says of his dog that“A Jew would have wept longer atour parting”(2.3.211–12),“Jew”signifies cold-heartedness. And so too whenFalstaffprotests that he is telling the truth by averring,“I am a Jew else, anEbrew Jew”(1Henry IV2.4.177). The very casual nature of such utterancesseems symptomatic of the anti-Semitic culture in which Shakespeare lived.He rose above the level of such insularity, but he was part of it still.In this sense, his treatment of Judaism may seem somewhat less sophisti-cated and self-aware than his mediating negotiations of Catholic and Puritan.Judaism comes across in his plays as something alien, strange, and ultimatelybeyond the range of his vast powers of sympathy and understanding. So toowith his occasional references to Tartars, Turks, Scythians, Saracens, Indians,Moors, Cathayans, and the like.18Shakespeare speaks from the vantage point,and to audiences who share that perspective, of belonging (despite internaldifferences that can be bitter) to a Christian culture.18See David Bevington,“Imagining the East: Shakespeare’s Asia,”in Douglas A.

Job Throckmortonwrote to Ralph Warcupp that he had arrested William Skinner, andsearched his house at Rowington, some nine miles north of Stratford asthe crowflies. Enclosed with the letter were the examinations of ninewitnesses, including the minister of Rowington, the parish clerk, the churchcourt summoner, and various yeomen and husbandmen, one with thepleasingly Shakespearean name of Sly. The depositions show that Skinnerhad been harboring within his house a seminary priest, called Baker or Bird,disguised as a schoolmaster, and also that he held some pretty rebarbativeopinions about politics and religion. Thomas Sly recalled Skinner saying tohim“that the protestants doctors of theire owne syde did defende that awoman coulde not be supreme heade”; this, a proposition that Skinnerconfidently ascribed to Calvin. Equally seriously, he had heard Skinner“defende the Queene of Scots tytle and saye that she is next heyre apparanteto the crowne”–the truth that dare not speak its name in ElizabethanEngland, and the eventuality that committed Protestants, from WilliamCecil downwards, were desperate to avoid.The fullest testimony came from the parish clerk, John Fairfax. He too,about four orfive years ago, he thought, had had the conversation withSkinner about the royal supremacy, and listened to the argument thatProtestants themselves denied the queen’s status as Supreme Head, callingher only“supreme governes.”Skinner had added that St. Peter was pope ofRome“and thence, sayde he, comethe the trewe succession.”Warming tohis theme, Skinner demanded of Fairfax what he thought of the bishops ofnew making. Fairfax scrupulously replied (or so he now claimed) that“theyare lawfully made by the prynce as supreme heade.”“Why, thow fool,”scoffed Skinner,“yf one make thee a lease under a bushe, is that a good40"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"lease? No more...are our Byshops lawfull Byshops.”A couple of years afterthis, Fairfax and Skinner had“had other talke.”Skinner was now“in goodhope that religion wold turne,”or at least that the government was shortlyto decree a liberty of religion, that“every man shoold live as he lyke.”If sucha decree were to be made, he rhetorically demanded of Fairfax,“how manythinckeste thow...wolde come to churche?”Skinner had his own answerready to hand:“not passinge x of our parishe, I warrante thee.”Fairfax,whether solemnly or jocularly, remarked that such a decree would be arecipe for endless discord, it“wolde goo neare to bringe us all to gether bythe eares.”But his companion was in no mood for levity:“no, saydMr Skynner, ye will never be able to stand wth us, we shalbe v: to oneagainst you.”And just in case Fairfax was still in any doubt about howthings stood, Skinner added:“Thow art a foole...dooeste thow thinke,that this religion is the trewthe? In my conscience I thinke it is not.”1Readers can relax: no new biographical revelations about the youngShakespeare, and no claims of direct textual resonances in his work, areconnected to this incident.2And yet we seem to start here in very familiarterritory: the world of“hot”Warwickshire Catholicism, which Shakespeareof course knew, and which, according to some commentators at least,substantially nurtured and shaped him. Less than six months after thearrest and interrogation of Skinner, Francis Throckmorton, scion of aWarwickshire Catholic house (andfirst cousin of Skinner’s interrogator,Job) was executed for his part in the plot against Elizabeth that bears hisname.3And less than a year before that, another Warwickshire squire, JohnSomerville, kin-in-law to Shakespeare’s Arden relatives, died mysteriouslyin the Tower on the eve of his execution for devising a madcap schemeto assassinate the queen with a pistol.4An ideologically straight line (andsome only slightly twisted familial and genealogical ones) runs from theSomerville and Throckmorton plots to the Gunpowder conspiracy of1605,which, as everyone knows, was substantially hatched in Shakespeare’scounty.5Foreshadowing this, several of the characteristic notes of the1National Archives, State Papers12/167, fos.54r–61r (hereafter SP followed by the series number).2The closest connection that can be made is that John Shakespeare of Rowington, a distant kinsman,was in litigation with William Skinner in the1570s: C.

The English Reformation was already ageneration old–his father, John Shakespeare, was likely born just asHenry VIII’s divorce campaign was reaching a crescendo–and deepdivisions had certainly emerged across society, particularly after the blood-letting of Mary I’s reign. Yet in Elizabeth’sfirst years, the lines might stillseem fuzzy and permeable, a pattern encouraged by a monarch who washerself a specialist in sending out ambiguous signals. This was a Protestantqueen who retained cross and candlesticks in her chapel royal and displayeda pronounced disdain for clerical marriage. Out of a mixture of optimisticdelusion and Spanish diplomatic pressure (Philip II was much more con-cerned about the threat from France), the papacy held back from excom-municating Elizabeth and offered little guidance to Catholics in Englandabout how they should respond to the new realities. At the start of the reign,a group of leading Catholic laymen petitioned the Council of Trent, askingwhat“men of true piety and learning think they ought to do”with regard tothe legal requirement (under the1559Act of Uniformity) to attend churchservices. Forwarding the petition, the Spanish ambassador made clear hisview that it was not a question of such very great moment: the“CommonPrayers”of the Church of England, he judged,“contain no false doctrinewhatever nor anything impious. It is all Scripture or prayers taken from theCatholic Church.”Catholics might thus attend them with only slightlycompromised consciences.7As virtually all historians now agree, Catholics–or at least religiousconservatives–constituted a clear majority of the nation in Elizabeth’sfirstyears. Moreover, they also supplied a substantial proportion of the“politicalnation,”that small minority of the populace whose views counted forsomething. A survey of justices of the peace, commissioned from the6Calvin’s dislike of Henry VIII’s royal supremacy was a staple of Catholic propaganda in this period:Peter Marshall,“John Calvin and the English Catholics,c.1565–1640,”Historical Journal,53(2010),864–5.7Ginerva Crosignani, Thomas M.

Divisions hardened, legislative pressure on Catholics increased, andefforts to Protestantize the nation as a whole took on a new impetus. AsPatrick Collinson once remarked, it makes sense to think of theReformation, the real Reformation, as“something which happened in thereigns of Elizabeth and James”10–or, as Collinson implied elsewhere,something which happened during the life span of William Shakespeare.11By the time Shakespeare reached adulthood, a decade on from the trauma-tizing events of1568–70, the divisions had deepened and the middle groundhad been squeezed still further in the wake of a succession of Catholic plotsand the furore caused by the start of the Jesuit mission. The soul andinspiration of that mission, Edmund Campion, was executed at Tyburn in1581, an event which, as several scholars have argued, may have been deeplytraumatic for the Catholic community in Shakespeare’s Warwickshire.12On the scaffold, Campion was urged by the attending Protestant preacher8Mary Bateson (ed.),“A Collection of Original Letters from the Bishops to the Privy Council,1564,”inCamden Miscellany, vol.ix, Camden Society n.s.53(London,1895), pp.7–8.9Peter Marshall,Faith and Identity in a Warwickshire Family: The Throckmortons and the Reformation,Dugdale Society Occasional Paper49(Stratford-upon-Avon: Dugdale Society,2010), p.13.10Patrick Collinson,The Birthpangs of Protestant England: Religious and Cultural Change in the Sixteenthand Seventeenth Centuries(New York: St. Martin’s Press,1988), p. ix.11Patrick Collinson,“William Shakespeare’s Religious Inheritance and Environment,”in hisElizabethan Essays(London: Hambledon Press,1994), pp.219–52.12Richard Wilson,Secret Shakespeare: Studies in Theatre, Religion, and Resistance(ManchesterUniversity Press,2004), esp. ch.2; Peter Milward,“Shakespeare’s Jesuit Schoolmasters,”inChoosing sides and talking religion in Shakespeare’s England43"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"to pray with him and make the conventional gestures of end-of-lifepenitence. Yet Campion refused to do so:“you and I, we are not of onereligion.”13This, then, was an era of choosing sides, of–to employ a favoredhistorians’term-of-art–“confessionalization.”14It was a decade or twointo Elizabeth’s reign that the categorical nomenclature of“Catholic”and“Protestant”became stabilized into something like its modern form, sup-plemented by new terms of divisive distinction, notably“Puritan.”15Theshapers of religious opinion expected people to stand up and be counted. Atacit understanding of the imperatives which might lead to dissimulationunder persecution, characteristic of the early Reformation period, gave wayto a growing barrage of“anti-Nicodemite”rhetoric in the second half of thesixteenth century.16Clerical writers, like the Jesuits Robert Persons andHenry Garnet, usually insisted that a stance of strict recusancy (refusal toattend any Church of England services) was the only acceptable one forCatholics, while Protestant moralists, strengthened by the example of theMarian martyrs, demanded doctrinal purity and moral earnestness, and anend to mere“carnal gospelling.”The distillation of clearer confessionalidentities was facilitated by preaching and catechesis, and by the martyr-ologies and copious religious polemic produced on all sides. It was under-written by the processes of generational change, as England transformeditself, over the course of Shakespeare’s lifetime, from a nation reformed inname and law, to one that had become deeply culturally Protestant, or atleast viscerally anti-Catholic.17The undoubted“confessionalization”of late sixteenth- and earlyseventeenth-century England was not, however, solely a matter of theprogressive social and theological divergence of self-identifying groupings,Richard Dutton, Alison Findlay, and Richard Wilson (eds.),Theatre and Religion: LancastrianShakespeare(Manchester University Press,2003), pp.58–70; Michael Wood,In Search ofShakespeare(London: BBC Books,2003), pp.73–80.13Henry Ellis (ed.),Holinshed’s Chronicles,6vols.

Recognizing this may not be any kind of hermeneutic key tounlocking Shakespeare’s meanings, but it is arguably vital to an under-standing of the world in which he was formed and performed. Already at thestart of his adult life (inverting the conditions of a generation before)England had become a nation with a dominant Protestant culture and arepressed Catholic subculture. But we should not imagine that the formerwas confidently unshakeable, or the latter self-evidently shrinking andintrospectively sectarian; that Shakespeare must by definition have been apoet and playwright of a“post-Reformation”established order, withinwhich Catholicism carried at most a nostalgic or unsettlingly atavisticcharge. Contemporaries certainly did not see matters this way.Let us return to the Rowington testimony of1584and take note of somefeatures of it that may not have immediately impressed themselves upon ourattention. One is that the evidence of dispute and debate to which thedocument so evidently attests took place within a context of social, andindeed sociable, interactions between the papist Skinner and his Protestant,or at least conformist, neighbors. Skinner, it would appear, was ready to talktheology and politics with almost anyone who would listen. Thomas Sly,John Fairfax, and the summoner, Richard Richardson, were able to testifythat Skinner was harboring a priest because they had all been guests in hishouse and at his table and had seen there a schoolmaster who didn’t seemquite like a schoolmaster.18Another related characteristic of the Rowington vignette is that it doesnot present a picture of Warwickshire Catholicism as an inverted, isolatedsect. Skinner affected to believe, and perhaps really believed, that a largemajority of his churchgoing neighbors were Catholics at heart: not morethan ten in the parish were Protestants by choice and conviction.19Indeed,it is not at all clear that Skinner himself was at this time a recusant in the fulltechnical sense. A couple of the witnesses noted that he had kept his sonAnthony and daughter Martha from attending church, but none of themsaid that he himself was a persistent nonattender. He does not appear on acirca1580list of“obstinate recusants”in the diocese of Worcester (whichincluded Thomas Otwell of Rowington), and it is notable that he and his18SP12/167, fos.57r,58r,60r.19Rowington was certainly a remarkably Catholic place: in1605–6there seem to have been at least sixtyrecusants in the parish: V.

His buoyant hopes for a decree oftoleration were almost certainly linked to his reading of thefinal round ofmarriage negotiations between Elizabeth and the Catholic Duke of Anjou,coming to their inconclusive conclusion only in1582.21And for Skinner,toleration was not so much a life raft of conscience as a springboard torecovered dominance:“we shalbe v: to one against you.”These glimpses of what was happening in Rowington can serve aspointers to some dynamic patterns of religious life in Shakespeare’sWarwickshire and in the nation more broadly. William Skinner’s militantlyideological Catholicism, paradoxically combined with his pragmatic will-ingness to attend church, and his views on the outward conformity of hisCatholic neighbors and tenants, confirms what scholars have been sayingfor some time about the phenomenon of“church papistry”in Elizabethanand Jacobean England. Namely, that far from being a moribund symptomof the decaying half-life of medieval England, the willingness of those whothought of themselves as Catholics intermittently to attend the services ofthe Protestant Church of England was aflexible and effective survivalstrategy, and one which was very widely practiced, despite what the clericalpurists wanted to say about the matter.22One result of this is that contemporaries did not have any real idea, anymore than modern historians, of just how many“Catholics”there wereacross the nation as a whole. Protestant anxieties were thus kept in apermanently heightened state. Semicyclical movements of Catholics outof conformity and into recusancy could provoke apprehensive claims about20SP12/167, fos.56r,60r; Lambeth Palace Library, CMiv/183; Fripp,Shakespeare’s Haunts,p.75.

One of the paradoxesof the period is that ferocious antipopery sat alongside a fair degree of day-to-day practical toleration, and many instances of social and sociableinteractions between neighbors of different faiths.25Meanwhile, therewere persistent complaints that authorities at every level were not rigorousor severe enough in enacting the laws against recusants. In1573, for example,Richard Cook, curate of Stone in Staffordshire, was in trouble with hisbishop, the sternly Protestant Thomas Bentham, for“tomoch familiaritieand baryng with them in Stone which are iudged to be papists.”26InStaffordshire in early1588the county magistracy and the clergy blamedeach other for sluggishness in prosecuting Catholic dissidents, and notproperly certifying their names; in Herefordshire, sheriffs, justices of thepeace and juries alike were said“to wincke at the offenders,”drawn awayfrom their duty by claims of“kindred and friendship.”27WilliamChadderton, bishop of Lincoln, complained in1605about the difficultyof getting local people to report recusants:“there is no man will become anaccuser of his neighbors unless he be very malicious or be charged upon hisoath by authority.”28Religious divisions rubbed against the bonds of23For example,Calendar of State Papers Domestic:Elizabeth, vol.clv,42: Earl of Leicester toWalsyngham (Sept.1582); vol.cclxii,25: Dean of Durham to Sec.

It wouldscarcely be an exaggeration to say that every family in Elizabethan Englandwas a religiously divided one, at least in the minimal sense that allfirst- andsecond-generation Protestants must have had Catholic parents and grand-parents. But vertical divisions within families were common too. Onecontemporary“database”of autobiographical information, the question-naires completed by young seminarians entering the Catholic collegesat Rome and Valladolid around the turn of the seventeenth century,shows that a strikingly high number came from families with memberswho were either“schismatics”or“heretics.”29As we have already seen, theWarwickshire Throckmorton family was (deeply) religiously divided, butits members were not irrevocably estranged from each other across confes-sional lines, and in that at least it must have been typical. Several times inthe1580s Arthur Throckmorton, thefirmly Protestant son of Elizabeth I’sminister Nicholas Throckmorton, went hunting in the Midlands with hissolidly Catholic (and persistently recusant) uncle, Anthony. The partyhabitually overnighted both with their Catholic cousins at CoughtonCourt and Weston Underwood and with the Puritan one (Job) atHaseley.30Was religion a diplomatically taboo subject on these occasionsor an irresistible magnet of discussion and argument?There is in fact considerable evidence that, as at Rowington, the people ofElizabethan and Jacobean England did not always politely steer clear ofreligious controversy in the course of their everyday social interactions. Wesee this very clearly in a (frustratingly undated and unlocated) report of anencounter taking place in a coastal inn or lodging house during the secondhalf of Elizabeth’s reign.

That discussion of religion may have been aninstinct among all classes of people in the late Elizabethan period issuggested by the fact that the instructions for thefleet drawn up by theEarl of Essex and Lord Admiral Howard in1596sought to ban it, layingdown that“noe man, souldier or other marriner doe dispute of matters ofreligion, unles it bee to bee resolved of some doubts, and in such case thathee converseth with the minister of the Armie, for it is notfitt thatunlearned men should openlie argue of high and mysticall matters.”32Nonetheless, they clearly did, though almost by definition we learn aboutsuch arguments only when they pathologized their way into the record ofdiscipline and denunciation.Alehouse talk turned to religion in late1595at Wisbech inCambridgeshire, the town where captured missionary priests were internedin the local castle.

Gunnes was in fact an old Marian priestwho had served in the Elizabethan Church but then given up his benefice ofYelford some seven years earlier“for his conscience.”Arden lured the priestinto a lane where he had caused“two honest men to be behind a pale wherethey myght heere their conference.”These testified that Gunnes had spokenin praise of Campion and that he trusted one day to see a religious houseerected in recompense on the spot where the Jesuit had suffered.Interestingly, rather than pretending to be a sympathizer (the classic tacticof the agent provocateur), Arden freely engaged Gunnes in debate about theauthority of Scripture and papal supremacy, leaving the priest in no doubtthat“yoe are of Luthers opynyon.”One wonders if Gunnes, who admittedthat since giving up his benefice he had been“vagrant heere and there,”wasin the habit of arguing religion with people he met in pubs.41It would be wrong to suppose that people habitually spoke whatever wason their mind in matters of religion, in whatever the company they foundthemselves. Naturally, they were aware that there might be times to mindtheir words and guard their tongues.

It was only eighteen months after, imprisoned in the Fleet fordebt and desperate to curry favor, that the third man, Richard Vennar (latera patriotic writer and famously unsuccessful theater impresario), decided tospill the beans.42We cannot, of course, know how many“seditious words”went unre-ported; how many religious discussions were quietly folded away to memoryand reflection. But there were surely many. In1595the London silk weaverRichard Garret only gave evidence against his tenant Anne Dryland con-cerning her treasonously pro-Spanish views after they had come to themayor’s attention by another route, claiming that he had simply been“ignorant of the law”in these matters.43Pressed as to why it had takenhim so long to report the treason of dinner-table controversialist andEusebian exegete, John Hardy, the Farnham preacher Peter German ratherlimply explained“that he shortlie fell lame...for the space of a wholequarter of the year.”44The impulse to discussion and debate was, in fact, at the heart of thereligious culture of Shakespeare’s age. Works of religious polemic andpersuasion, as well as of pastoral encouragement, habitually utilized thedialogue form, in which representative characters of divergent viewpoints,meeting at inns or on highways, argue freely with each other and are oftengiven, within the overweening didactic purposes of the author, a more orless fair hearing.45The Protestant clergy regularly sought to encourage thefaithful and persuade the recalcitrant through the habit of“conference,”that is, private discussion–something which was not infrequently made acondition of acceptance of recusants back into conformity with the Churchof England.46Catholics for their part might express enthusiasm for theideal, which, formally at least, granted a kind of parity to their beliefs andopinions. The Jesuit Henry Walpole, in prison in1594, claimed to havefound fewer differences than expected when he conferred with the learned42SP12/256, fos.134r,135r.

That made it–from the authorities’point of view–a risky andunstable exercise if the conditions were not tightly controlled, as they werefor Campion’s debates in the Tower in1581.50By contrast, in1599Archbishop Matthew Hutton of York was decidedly unhappy about theactivities of the former Jesuit, Thomas Wright, who had returned toEngland and placed himself under Essex’s protection,“by reason of hisoften disputing with the ministers of Yorke, and talking with others ofReligion.”51Not always, but often enough, religious discussion was initiatedwith the clear intention of converting the other party to the side of truereligion; this was theraison d’êtreof the Jesuit missioner and the Puritanpreacher alike, though laypeople too sometimes took it upon themselves tocajole or argue an acquaintance into changing their allegiances.52Part of the calculus of conversion, of choosing sides, was not just thequestion of who was in the right, but that of who was going to win–issuesnot unconnected with each other in the thought patterns of a deeplyprovidential age. It is important to reiterate here that Catholics did notknow they were the defeated party, destined for permanent minority andsubcultural status in a Protestant and imperial nation.

The papists“looke for a golden day,”warned a report from Norfolkin1584, and boast how“they have as much favoure in ye courtt as theprotestantes have.”53Skinner was not alone in Warwickshire in the early1580s in thinking that an imminent royal marriage to the Duke of Anjoumight totally transform the religiopolitical scene. One of the curates of thevicar of Wooton (serving either Henley or Ullenhall) was shamed (thoughsadly not named) in the Puritan survey of the ministry in1586:“uponrumour of a change in religion in Monsieur’s days [he] did shave hisbeard.”54The beard was the identifying mark of the Protestant minister;the clean cheek that of the celibate Catholic priest. Despite the failure of theAnjou match and of successive Spanish invasion schemes, Catholic politicalaspirations were far from receding in thefinal years of Elizabeth’s reign.Hopes that the likeliest successor, James VI of Scotland, might offertoleration in return for Catholic support, or that he himself–son of asainted martyr–might declare himself for the Catholic cause, were rife insome Catholic circles through the1590s and beyond. Protestants meanwhilemight be worried. It was reported in1597that“the King of Scots talkscarelessly about religion,”saying that purgatory and the real presence ofChrist in the sacrament were matters on which there need not be disputebetween Protestants and Catholics.55In the event, Catholic disappointmentwith the new regime was palpable, and an important contributory factor tothe debacle of the Gunpowder Plot. But thereafter, James’s commitment toa“pacific”foreign policy, and to the pursuit of a Catholic match for his heir,combined with the discreet presence of a Catholic queen at the court,continued to supply grounds for optimism about the prospects for thefaith through thefirst decades of the seventeenth century.I have been arguing that the religious atmosphere of later Elizabethan andJacobean England, in the Midlands and elsewhere, was articulate, animated,and contested; that the religious future of the country was frequently seen asuncertain, and its current state widely regarded as contingent and unsettled;that discussion and debate involving sensitive religious matters was by nomeans unusual among people at a variety of social levels, and in a variety ofprivate and semipublic settings.

I pose the questions withoutassuming any of the responsibility for answering them. But I will takeoccasion to note here that Shakespeare scholarship has for some decadesnow been in fruitful communication with the evolving historical interpre-tations of the Reformation and the religious culture of his age. The“revi-sionist”turn of scholarship on the Reformation in the1980s and90s,drawing attention to the theme of resistance, and to the hitherto relativelyneglected Catholic“other,”was undoubtedly influential in the revival of“Catholic Shakespeare”theories which had lain semidormant in the blood-stream of Shakespeare biography for a century and more.58Yet shadowingand eventually subsuming revisionism has been a“postrevisionist”versionof England’s Reformation experience, one which, rather than returning toprogressivist and triumphalist narratives of Protestant advance, has empha-sized both continuities and confusions, a Reformation which succeededprecisely because in many ways it represented less of a clear, clean, andcomplete break with pre-Reformation habits of thought than we wereaccustomed to think.59This too has made its mark on Shakespeare studiesof the last few years: in careful analysis of Shakespeare’s putatively“hybrid56For more on the religious diversity and debate in the capital city specifically, seeChapter3below.57Perhaps the most persuasive recent delineation and explication of Shakespeare’s“confessionalinvisibility”is Alison Shell,Shakespeare and Religion(London: Methuen,2010), quote at p.235.58Significant works here include Wilson,Secret Shakespeare; Dutton et al.,Theatre and Religion; DavidN.

The idea that an observer of society as astute asShakespeare could have been oblivious to or uninterested in the highlytopical religious (and therefore political) questions of the day stretchescredulity.61If we cannot observe him making distinct religious choices(like a Jonson or Donne) and cannot readily identify confessional state-ments or stances in his writings, we can at least be certain of one thing: thatthis was not because he inhabited a milieu where the questions simply didnot present themselves.1999) andThe Reformation of the Landscape: Religion, Identity, and Memory in Early Modern Britainand Ireland(Oxford University Press,2011); Peter Marshall,Beliefs and the Dead in ReformationEngland(Oxford University Press,2002).60Jean-Christophe Mayer,Shakespeare’s Hybrid Faith: History, Religion, and the Stage(Basingstoke:Palgrave Macmillan,2006); Beatrice Groves,Texts and Traditions: Religion in Shakespeare1592–1604(Oxford University Press,2007), quote at p.32; Stephen Greenblatt,Hamlet in Purgatory(PrincetonUniversity Press,2001).

Apart from activenonconformity there were many, like the playwright, who were Londonersneither by birth, nor exclusive residence, nor citizenship. They might, likethe diarist and sermon-goer John Manningham, be students at the Inns ofCourt, experiencing the capital for a few years, or gentry visitors in Londonfor the season only.6But for an example of a long-term migrant likeShakespeare we can turn to Richard Stonley, diarist and Teller ofthe Exchequer. Stonley was an established resident of St. Botolph’s,Aldersgate, and a man whose devout adherence to the ProtestantSettlement is consistently revealed in the diaries he kept in the early1580sand1590s. They record a steady diet of prayer and religious reading, hisbook purchases including much current religious controversy. Stonley alsohad a rural estate at Doddinghurst, Essex, and lived there as often as hisofficial duties permitted. We might anticipate that his commitment to bothhis parishes was strong, and indeed in the country he was punctilious inattending church, commenting on sermons and entertaining the clergy. Intown, however, though he paid his dues to St. Botolph, he seems to havebeen a very intermittent Sunday attender. Otherwise he divided his Sabbath4Shell,Shakespeare and Religion,p.235.5The most optimistic assessment is given by Jeremy Boulton in his study of Easter communion inSouthwark, in which he estimates from the issue of tokens that between80percent and98percent ofparishioners took the Eucharist in the1620s:“The Limits of Formal Religion: The Administration ofHoly Communion in Late Elizabethan and Early Stuart London,”London Journal,10(1984),135–54.On the other hand, Ian Archer’sfigures for two city parishes show percentages no higher than75percent in the later Elizabethan period:The Pursuit of Stability: Social Relations in Elizabethan London(Cambridge University Press,1991), pp.90–1.6Robert P.

Stonley’s outlook is that of a con-formist Protestant: it is not clear that this translated into parochial loyalty inthe capital.Richard Stonley’s diaries offer an insight into the diverse ways in whichthe religious environment of the capital could be experienced, one whichdoes not automatically privilege the obvious routines of the establishedchurch. The London of the1590s to the1620soffered a range of religiousexperience. There was a multifaceted official Protestantism, with its ideo-logical roots in Calvinist theology; a culture of the godly for whom intensepreaching had become the focus of experimental faith; formal liturgicalritual maintained in cathedral and court; and the beginning of a new form ofreligious identity that was to become English Arminianism by the1630s.These public expressions of faith were paralleled by a radical puritan andsectarian underground and by a vigorous Catholicism, both forms ofrecusancy seeking to intervene in open debate through print and manu-script. The Jesuit Robert Persons in hisA Brief Discours(1580) thus repre-sented this diversity to the queen:“There are in this your Maiesties Realmefower knowen religions, and the professors thereof, distinct both in name,spirit and doctrine, that is to say the Catholickes, the Protestants, thePuritanes, and the howsholders of love [Familists]. Besids al other petyesects, newly borne and yet grovelinge on the ground.”8Persons was notoffering a neutral description: his agenda sought to demonstrate the priorityof Catholics, the divisions between Protestants and Puritans and the trou-bling growth of radical minorities.

Anthony Maxey, preaching at court in1606, described a city full of“painfull preaching frequented with infinitecongregations, and mightie assemblies.”11Seaver calculated that approxi-mately one hundred sermons were being preached each week by lecturers in1600, and by the end of the Jacobean era few city parishes can have beenwithout regular Sunday provision.12The author ofThe Prentises Practice inGodlinesse(1608) expressed thanks that individuals could go to some lectureafter evening prayers in their parish,“as there be divers (blessed bee God) indivers parts of the City.”13In addition to parochial provision there was theregular Sunday sermon at Paul’s Cross, and the specialized pulpit of theTemple Church for the lawyers, while at Westminster there was the Abbeyand above all preaching at court when the monarch was in residence. ArnoldHunt’s study of preaching in late Elizabethan and early Stuart England isappropriately calledThe Art of Hearing, and Shakespeare cannot haveescaped hearing, and seeing, the practice of religion in the metropolis.14As Hunt says,“it was impossible to avoid exposure to the Protestantpreaching ministry, even if, for some, it was merely part of the backgroundhum of urban life.”15For many of the godly this abundant provision led to an almost freneticgadding from parish to parish to hear the latest minister of the Word.9In what follows I have endeavored to use the term London to include the separate jurisdictions ofWestminster and the near suburbs, while specifically identifying the City when appropriate.10The1592trials of Thomas Cartwright and the nine ministers represented at least a major caesura inthe struggle for a Presbyterian style of settlement: Patrick Collinson,The Elizabethan PuritanMovement(London: Jonathan Cape,1967), pp.417–32.11Anthony Maxey,The Churches Sleepe, Expressed in a Sermon Preached at the Court(London,1606), sig.C4v.12Paul S.

Mobility in attending sermons led John Whalley tocomplain that there were too many individuals who might run up and downto hear the Word with Bibles under their arms, but their spirits remained“vast rooms unswept, with many dark corners”filled with disobedience andsin.18One of the most familiar sermon structures of the period developedthe theme of a failure of godliness: the favored jeremiad theme, sometimesknown as“England’s warning by Israel,”castigated the sins of the city,denounced the particular vices of the age (including of course gadding toplayhouses) and threatened divine judgment on those to whom God hadthus far been merciful.19Stephen Egerton was a master of this mode: he toldhis Sunday congregation that if they, as parishioners and fellow Londoners,did not repent then“the most wicked and prophane Cittyes in the world...shall rise in iudgement against you.”20The specific form of the jeremiad was only one of many alternatives opento the urban preacher, who had to tune the pulpit to occasion and auditors.The range of possibility, from the political defense of secular and16See, for example, Lady Margaret Hoby and Sir Richard Paulet, both of whom attended a stream ofgodly sermons when in town: Pauline Croft,“Capital Life: Members of Parliament Outside theHouse,”in Thomas Cogswell, Richard Cust, and Peter Lake (eds.),Politics, Religion and Popularity inEarly Stuart Britain: Essays in Honour of Conrad Russell(Cambridge University Press,2002),pp.72–81.17Mary Morrissey,Politics and the Paul’s Cross Sermons,1558–1642(Oxford University Press,2011), p.42.For a comparativefigure, see Peter McCullough’s calculation that141Jacobean court sermons werepublished, as against only28from Elizabeth’s reign:Sermons at Court: Politics and Religion inElizabethan and Jacobean Preaching(Cambridge University Press,1998), p.8.18John Whalley,Gods Plenty, Feeding True Pietie(London,1616), pp.16–17.19Alexandra Walsham,Providence in Early Modern England(Oxford University Press,1999),pp.281–325.20Egerton’s comment here was noted by George Frevile, an assiduous sermon note-taker: BritishLibrary, Egerton MS2877, fo.29v.Experiencing religion in London61"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ecclesiastical authority, through the anti-Catholic disquisition, to the expo-sition of demanding predestinarian doctrine, might indicate that preacherswere led to underline ideological division through their choice of homileticsubject. But the emphasis was most often upon unity, both of theme andmethod. In part a commonalty of preaching method assisted the preacher.His purpose was the proper exposition and application of a passage ofScripture: the choice of a short text, followed by its dissection and explica-tion, was then expanded into lessons appropriate to the congregation. Thismethod of dissecting and expounding Scripture offered rich opportunity forpromoting mainstream Protestant doctrine. It was here that the views ofmost London clergy could legitimately be described as articulating a“Calvinist consensus.”By the turn of the sixteenth century most had beeneducated at university in an environment that valued above all Calvin’sscriptural commentaries, and debated interminably the nuances of a pre-destinarian view of grace and election.21While the fundamentals of reformed theology might be agreed, Londonministers had to ask how far“difficult”doctrine was appropriate to thepastoral context of the pulpit.22There were differences of emphasis on this,as on a number of other aspects of biblical interpretation among the Londonclergy, but no general hesitation in speaking or writing of the“comfortabledoctrine”of assurance, or even the essential topic of reprobation. EdwardPhilips’s lectures at St. Saviour’s, Southwark, printed from the notes takenby Henry Yelverton, gave considerable attention to the practical implica-tions of the idea of election, urging his auditors to get“as many testimoniesas we can to prove that this election pertaineth to us,”though Huntobserves that he kept his most rigorous interpretations to the weekdaylectures on Romans8.23Stephen Egerton, on the other hand, was moreprone to address predestinarian issues in his Sunday sermons than in hismore moralistic addresses to his weekday congregations.24Even courtpreaching might address predestinarianism with an explicit boldness, atleast under James.

ThusJohn Pelling, having talked of the“immutable decree”of election andreprobation, used Psalm104to hymn divine providence:“God...inwisdom...made, maintained, governed and ordained...the heavensspred like a curtaine, and light to decke all as with a glorious garment.”26The pastoral message constantly repeated by the London preachers was thatthe divine decree was inescapable, but that men’s actions were neverthelessto display moral autonomy: their upright actions being the proper fruits oftheir faith.The agreed-upon political message resounding from the London pulpitsin these years was that of antipopery. Paul’s Cross sermons from the1580sonwards included an antipapal diatribe as at least an obligatory sub-themeof their message.27Many-faceted as hostility to Catholicism could be, in thefollowing decades it had hardened into a series of well-rehearsed themes thathad apparently won wide acceptance from their auditors. Providentialdeliverances from the great forces of Spain and the papacy–the queen’spreservation; the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots; the Armada’s defeat;and later James’s preservation from the Gunpowder Plot–all confirmed theneed for“thankfull remembrance”amid denunciation of the Antichrist.28John Manningham solemnly described antipapal and anti-Catholic dia-tribes of this kind as a staple fare of his sermon-going.29This was a topicupon which the godly could venture without much fear of contradiction,touching as it did both popular fears and the continuing uncertainties of thepolitical nation. It identified the absent“other”mired in sin and error, andprovided, in Alex Walsham’s words, a“kind of cultural cement”for thecongregation.30Special preaching, especially after the Gunpowder Plot,kept alive the established rhetoric of anti-Catholicism, weaving it into theother themes of the jeremiad favored by the godly.31This ensured an25Anthony Maxey,The Golden Chaine of Mans Salvation, and the Fearefull Point of Hardening, Openedand Set Downe in Severall Sermons preached before the King(London,1606).26John Pelling,A Sermon of the Providence of God(London,1607), p.5.27Morrissey,Politics and Paul’s Cross, pp.181–2.28For a good example of the two themes run together, see John Dove,A Sermon Preached at Pauls Crossethe3of November1594(London,1594).29Sorlien,Diary of John Manningham, pp.92,100,111,143.30Peter Lake,“Anti-Popery: The Structure of a Prejudice,”in Richard Cust and Ann Hughes (eds.),Conflict in Early Stuart England: Studies in Religion and Politics,1603–1642(London: Longman,1989),pp.72–106.

Presbyterian visions mighthave been suppressed, but the church establishment continued to fearconspiracy. Most attempts at discipline were undertaken through thechurch courts, though Richard Bancroft’s1589sermon at Paul’s Cross,rightly described by Patrick Collinson as a“diatribe”against Puritanism,took the challenge into the heart of the London godly community.33Publicconfutation was not something, in Bancroft’s view, to be directed onlyagainst Catholics or sectaries; rather, it had to be addressed, too, to theenemy within, to those“false prophets”who were the“precise”brethren. Inthe wake of the Marprelate pamphlets, Bancroft was determined to treat“the godly”as no longer members of the English religious commonwealthbut as another, and seditious, church. Two years later the prophet“FrantikHacket”was proclaimed in Cheapside by his besotted followers as a saviorof the true church of the presbyters, and Bancroft and his ministers seizedthe opportunity again to denounce the Presbyterian ministers in a pam-phleteering war.34From time to time in the early years of James there was areturn to this public assault: in1607, for example, Bancroft’s chaplainSamuel Collins preached at the Cross a generalized critique of the godlyclergy who“bite the lip and hang the head, at Supremacie of princes, in eachkinde of causes, mentioned in prayers, as if that were butflatterie, being castupon kings, and the truer right thereof in Ecclesiasticall ménages belongd tothe Presbiters.”35It is perhaps surprising that Londoners heard only a limited number ofsermons of confrontation with the godly preachers. For the public face ofmoderate Puritanism was always in danger of being undermined by variousforms of radicalism within and without the church. Most visibly, there wasthat sanctioned form of Calvinist church order, the Stranger congregationsof the Dutch and French Reformed.

Acute fears that the English wouldbe infected by the doctrinal radicalism of their guests were largely past,though sensitivities remained about their relationship to order in theEnglish Church. In the1580s London clergy were still petitioning thatcitizens visited the Stranger churches illegally in order to benefit fromtheir pure Calvinist worship, but by the end of the century at least part oftheflow was in the other direction, as settled Strangers often turned toEnglish parish worship. Tensions with the Strangers were more frequentlyabout their economic role at a time of general crisis than about theirchallenge to church order.37However, the two churches continued in keyrespects to represent an institutional vision at odds with that of their hosts.They adhered, of course, to the ministerial structure of Geneva, with itspastors, elders, and deacons, each church being served by three pastors,none of whom should“assert priority or dominion over the other.”Theelders had autonomy in managing their congregational affairs and disciplinethat many a London churchwarden must have envied.

Others who wished to live by congregationaldiscipline, including many of those led by the godly London preachers,could but envy their relative security. But most, even of the most zealousPuritan ministers, would not countenance the formal separation that thiswould have demanded. The opponents of the godly preachers–Bancroft orHarsnett–alleged, of course, that separatism was the inevitable result ofnonconformity, and the stage made such zeal into the parodic representa-tion of extreme Puritanism like Jonson’sBartholemew FairandAlchemistcharacters Zeal-of-the-Land-Busy and Deacon Ananias from Amsterdam.40In practice, Bancroft knew that most zealous behavior, and most“voluntaryreligion,”to use Collinson’s language, did not issue in separation from thenational church: Puritans might like to call one another brethren, and praisethe virtues of the saints, as did Jonson’s characters, but most still acceptedsome form of tarrying for the magistrate.41However, voluntary religion,with its emphasis on the shared society of the godly, and the pursuit ofedification by a community of the faithful, led readily towards a radicalismwhich in practice barely stopped short of separation. Lake and Como aresurely right to stress that for many Londoners the parish church was far lesssignificant than this underground network. Laymen sometimes misunder-stood the limits on voluntarism imposed by the radical preachers: EdwardPhilips, Stephen Egerton, and Giles Wigginton were singled out by mem-bers of gathered congregations as having in their sermons pointed the way towithdrawal from the national church.42For separation there was, and Londoners would have been made aware ofit in the early1590s through the trials and executions of Henry Barrow, JohnGreenwood, and John Penry. Henry Barrow was unequivocal that thenational church was a false church, its worship, ministry, government,and national identity all irrevocably tainted by worldly corruption.43Salvation was to be sought in separation,“to reduce all things to the trueand ancient and primitive pattern of God’s word,”established through an40For Jonson’s assault on the godly, see Peter Lake with Michael Questier,The Anti-Christ’s Lewd Hat:Protestants, Papists and Players in Post-Reformation England(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press,2002), pp.583–610.41Collinson,Religion of Protestants, pp.242–83.42Wigginton, though no separatist, was one of the few ministers willing to go as far as supportingHacket: Walsham,“‘Frantik Hacket,’”35.

In1592Greenwood was released long enough to be chosen as pastor of a Londoncongregation. Even after his second arrest significant meetings were uncov-ered, like that at whichfifty-six people were arrested in the woods nearIslington in1593. The removal of the Barrowists to Amsterdam broke someof the immediate challenge to the establishment, though a steadyflow ofprinted materials were then able to be distributed through London net-works. Francis Johnson, Barrow’s successor in leading the congregation, wasoptimistic that regime change in1603would facilitate their return, and heendeavored to gain personal access to James I with a petition for tolerationin the form allowed to the Dutch and French Stranger churches.45Others in the radical underground also saw the beginning of the newreign as a moment of possible liberation. The Familists, adherents of theNetherlands visionary and perfectionist Hendrick Niclaes, seized thisopportunity to emerge from the shadows for thefirst time since the1580sto address a petition for protection to a deeply unsympathetic king.46Sincethe Familists were Nicodemites and prepared to assimilate to the worship ofthe established church, it is pointless to try to demonstrate sectlike survivalin London. But the ideas of Familism do seem to have survived, sometimesmaking curious accord with radical Puritanism in the quest for religiouspurity. They became part of what David Como, in a vivid phrase, calls the“cacophonous religious scene of the capital”in the mid-Jacobean years.47The anti-Trinitarian Bartholomew Legate became the last person burnedfor heresy at Smithfield in1612; forms of Anabaptist belief were representedby the followers of the self-baptized“Se-baptist,”John Smyth, whoreturned to London after1612; and by1616Henry Jacob had establishedhis semi-separatist congregation in Southwark.48This is the world that hasbeen most closely observed in Peter Lake’s study of the conflict between the“orthodox”preacher Stephen Denison and the box-maker JohnEtherington.49Although their conflict involved much complexity and the44Barrington Raymond White,The English Separatist Tradition from the Marian Martyrs to the PilgrimFathers(Oxford University Press,1971), pp.73–6.45Ibid., pp.111–12.46See Christopher W.

This pulse in and out ofradical dissent is more visible in the career of the preacher HenochClapham, whose“maverick”career took him from Presbyterianism, viaBrownist views,flight to the separatists in Amsterdam, conversion toorthodox Calvinism, some successful years as a London preacher, conflictwith the ecclesiastical authorities, andfinal promotion to a living in Kent.Indeed, Clapham’s popularity as a London preacher helped to alert a wideaudience to the cacophony of dissent.51When Persons identified his four kinds of English Christians in1580,hehad little justification for seeing Protestants and Puritans as holding differentideologies. But by the late1590s an enthusiastic Londoner could have sermon-gadded to a kind of preaching different from the standard Paul’s Cross fare,one which quickly opened a genuine division. Lancelot Andrewes wasappointed to St. Giles, Cripplegate in1588, and in the1590s preachedparochial sermons that sought to restore the liturgical significance of thesacraments and to instill in his auditors an understanding that the Eucharisticelements themselves could remit sins.52Other manifestations of what weusually call“avant garde conformity”were to be found in the ritual life of50Ibid., pp.120–47.T.L.,An Exposition to the XI, XII, XIII Chapters of the Revelations(1623), butfirstprinted in1589,andespeciallyBabylon is Fallen(London,1597), which was dedicated to the Earl of Essex.51Clapham both preached and wrote on the multiplicity of religious errors of his time, concluding infavor of the Church of England (at least in his printed works):Errour on the Right Hand, Through aPreposterous Zeale(London,1608) andErrour on the Left Hand, Through a Frozen Securitie(London,1608).

Westminster under the conservative, andanti-Calvinist, Dean Goodman had long maintained a very formal view ofceremony, and had apparently endeavored to keep men of Puritan attitudeout of the pulpit. Copes and vestments for the clergy were retained, as was astrong musical tradition, and when Goodmanfinally died and was succeededfirst by Andrewes and then by Richard Neile, it was relatively easy to movefrom Elizabethan continuities to the beginnings of the new concern for the“beauty of holiness.”53Attendance at occasions of public ceremonial at theAbbey would have offered a markedly different view of the Protestant Churchfrom that of most London churches. The case of St. Paul’s was less obvious:there the equally long tenure of Dean Nowell meant that the cathedral wasmore in accord with the Puritan ethos of the city, while the canons seem tohave felt under siege from the tide of humanity that used the nave as a socialexchange.54But at the turn of the century, and especially after the arrival ofDean Overall in1602, ceremonialism increased, and music became significantagain. One account in praising the music described the singers and preacherswith white surplices“making use of many popish ceremonies, all kneelingdown on entering the church and otherwise keeping good order.”55When the royal court was at Whitehall it offered another site for thearticulation of beliefs that might challenge mainstream consensus. Thoughthe chapel royal was a relatively closed environment designed for the privatedevotions of the sovereign and the royal entourage, the outdoor preachingplace was the focus of the Lent sermon cycle and attracted crowds whichPeter McCullough has compared to those attending the Easter theaterseason at Bankside.56Court sermons, both delivered and printed, gave, ofcourse, greater access to commentary on the duties of kings than thosedelivered in the city; but under James they also allowed pleas for a cere-monialist view of religious behavior. Calvinist preachers remained in favorfor the Lenten seasons and godly Protestant prelates such as John King andJames Montagu were heard regularly. However, they were balanced fromearly in the reign by proto-Arminians such as Richard Neile, JohnBuckeridge, and, of course, Lancelot Andrewes.57At court, Andrewes53J. F.

EdmundHowes, the continuator of Stow’sAnnals of England, clearly thought theSt. Stephen’s example admirable, if somewhat unusual, since he remarkedon the fact that the glass had been“made only for that purpose.”61But thehunt for Laudian antecedents is, as Merritt has argued, surely less significantthan the sheer scale of refurbishment. Wainscoting, pewing, pulpit, andgallery building is more likely to represent an affirmation of greater securityin the current ecclesiastical climate, an acceptance that London under KingJames had a confident Protestant identity.That identity was still challenged most fully by the presence of Catholics,which must have been well known to ordinary citizens: London preachersmanifest anxiety about the threat within as well as grand papal conspiracy.58Lancelot Andrewes,XCVI Sermons, ed.

The patchy evidence suggests that in a few parishes,like St. John, Clerkenwell, or St. Andrew, Holborn, there was a degree ofparticipation by known Catholics until the mid-Elizabethan years.62Anaristocrat like the First Viscount Montague, whose London residence was inthe Southwark parish of St. Saviour, was minimally conformist until hisdeath in1592, though it is likely that the synod of1580, in which the Jesuitsfirst debated with some of the established English Catholic clergy, was heldin his residence.63But such behavior was becoming wholly problematic inthe face of the pressures of the post-Armada years and of the determinationof the missioners to challenge the compromises involved in occasionalobedience to the state. In these late Elizabethan years the committedrecusant community in London depended on occasional meetings withthe mission priests, who managed, with difficulty, to provide mass forgroups of the faithful. Safe houses were established for these priests, who,even in these adverse circumstances, found it better to operate from thecapital than elsewhere. The Jesuit John Gerard’s vivid autobiography of hislife in London and beyond in the1590s gives a powerful sense of thestruggles involved. He was able to rent or purchase a variety of properties,which were then adapted with concealed hides and secured with the supportof devout laymen. Once established he could sometimes, as in the house heshared with the Heywoods,“set up quite a large and well-equipped chapel”and say Mass for significant numbers of the faithful.64Lisa McClain argues that despite the underground nature of LondonCatholicism, it possessed aflexibility and diversity unparalleled by the faithelsewhere in the kingdom.65This is questionable for the1590s, but moreconvincing for the Jacobean period.

An importantconsequence for ordinary Catholics was a greater ability to access a keyresource for worship–the foreign embassies. Of course no English citizenswere supposed to attend Mass at the Spanish, French, or Venetian embas-sies, but the fact that some did had been a source of tension since the early1560s and had become a recurrent conflict between ambassadors and thePrivy Council in the years following peace with Spain. Successive Spanishambassadors refused to close their doors to coreligionists, and thoseCatholics wishing to hear Mass, especially at the great festivals, becameprogressively bolder. By1614the Easter feast at the embassy was celebratedwith processions–“as if I were in Seville”says Gondomar–and theattendance of a large number of Englishmen.66That same year the pursui-vants seized a number who attended the Palm Sunday Masses, and who hadcarried offboughs/palms which, in some cases, they passed on to otherLondoners.67In these same years we have the remarkable mission career ofLuisa de Carvajal, who lived as a nun with her companions ministering toEnglish Catholics under the partial protection of the Spanish embassy.

Themost sustained possibility for intervention in a public environment came, asit did for proscribed Protestant radicals, from books and other circulatedliterature.

Illicit presses had to be highly mobile, but several werelocated around London, taking advantage of the weaker jurisdictional controloutside the city.71These“domme preachers”allowed ideas, to quote JohnWilson in1616,to“penetrate where the priests and religious cannot enter.”72Popular works like the poetry of Robert Southwell and Persons’sFirst Booke ofthe Christian Exerciseclearly reached wide audiences, conformist as well asrecusant. From Campion’s brag challenging Protestants to disputation,through Persons’s sensationalConference about the next Succession,tothepolemics against the Jacobean Oath of Allegiance, the Catholic presses wereused publicly to intervene in the religious politics of the realm.73But thepriests did not rely solely on the battle of the books: the stream of executionsof the late Elizabethan years, and the slower, still significant, persecutionunder James, offered powerful possibilities for representing Catholic faith viathe gallows, especially in London, the nation’s main theater of execution. Lakeand Questier have shown how much significance was attached to last dyingwords, and the ability of the condemned of all conditions to utter them.Central to Catholic performance in these cases was the constant affirmationthat the martyrs died only for their faith, though they frequently sought todisrupt the drama of state punishment by deliberate movement from meekacceptance of political claims upon them to active defiance on religion. Thecrowd had rich opportunity to witness these critical events, though it wasdifficult to sway this theater in favor of Catholic belief given the strength ofpopular London antipopery. And always, whether at the gallows or in theliterary rehearsal of constancy and suffering, there was the electric possibilityof conversion.

This chapter beganwith the parish and the pew, thus it isfitting it should end with the prison.London’s jails offered one of the few opportunities for dissenters of all typesto gather a congregation in the heart of the city, rather thanflee to thesuburbs or the protection of the private household. There is some danger ofover-crediting the statements of contemporaries, especially the priests, thatprisons were successful venues for clandestine Masses: for Persons they were“excellent communication centres,”for some even the site of trueCatholicism.75“Captivity,”wrote Southwell,“is our principal freedom,”using of course a martyrological trope.76Historians are wise to prefaceaccounts of London jails with a reminder that there was extreme sufferingand restriction for many prisoners. But there is plenty of evidence fromhostile pursuivants and Privy Council material as well as Catholic sourcesthat Masses were being held, missions planned, and responses to opponentsdebated from apparently strict confinement. Garnet boasted that he wasable to say Mass for all the Catholic prisoners in the Clink in the1590s, andin February1600John Chamberlain reported a crowd of“three or fourscore”who were seized at the Marshalsea listening to a Capuchin preach.Luisa de Carvajal actually gained access to Newgate to visit two condemnedpriests on the night before their execution.77By the mid Jacobean years ahostile witness complained that Newgate seemed“rather a chapel for super-stitious service than a prison.”78And London’s other underground faithshad some of the sameflexibility. Brownists and Barrowists were able tocomfort their followers from prison, and, when a messenger was sent toNewgate to fetch the radical Bartholemew Legate to audience with KingJames, he was missing having been allowed to wander freely into theLondon streets!79Prisons continued to function, as they had done sincethe earliest days of the Reformation, as theaters for challenge, debate, andattempts at conversion. Both Catholic missionaries and Puritan clergy75For example, McClain,Lest we be damned, pp.65,144–5, tends to take a very optimistic view of thestrength of Catholic life within the prisons.

However,we should not always be persuaded by the voices of criticism and opposi-tion, or by the laments of the preachers over the backsliding, atheism, andheresy of Londoners. Conformity could indeed be found there, even in theenvironment of the prison. Garnet had to rattle his chains in the Clink todrown out Geneva psalms.81And Richard Stonley, imprisoned in the Fleetin1597for debts to the crown, there became a more assiduous follower ofsermons than he had ever been back in his home parish, carefully noting thepreacher in chapel almost every Sunday. On one occasion, he reported thata“Mr Hutchinson”(most likely William Hutchinson) had been unjustlyforbidden to preach by the prison warden, merely“For blamying vice,”thatstock-in-trade jeremiad of the London preacher.82Stonley was appalled atthe warden’s attempt to silence such a necessary and healthful castigation ofsinfulness, and in a prison of all places; Shakespeare, for his part, wouldsurely have been amused.The loss of Stonley’s diaries for much of the early1590s means that wecannot be certain if he himself was ever a playgoer, but many men of hiskind must have witnessed performances on the public stage. The citizensand artisans who, Andrew Gurr argues, were“the silent majority”inaudiences, came from the parishes of London and from a regular diet ofsermons both there and at Paul’s Cross.83They were equipped to respond tothe latest religious propaganda: the attacks on the authors of the MarprelateTracts in the early1590s, for example, or the“Elect Nation”plays ofRowley, Dekker, Webster, and Heywood staged by Henslowe in thefirstyears of James’s reign.84If the London preachers were even partiallysuccessful, an audience would have contained many who could80Michael C.

Even for the lesszealous, reared as they had been in the culture of the ElizabethanSettlement, the Bible and the Psalter were highly familiar territory.Congregations were constant auditors of the Protestant liturgy throughthe Prayer Book services. Andfinally, diversity of religious belief andpractice, overt or clandestine, was, as we have seen, the subject of commonknowledge in London.Shakespeare refused to stage those forms of Protestant propaganda towhich his fellow Londoners were routinely exposed.85The idea of God’sprovidential judgment on the elect nation influenced his writing only whenit was an integral part of the historical narrative. InKing John, for instance,at thefirst appearance of the Legate Pandolph, John conjures the fullrhetoric of Henrician authority–“we, under God, are supreme head”–while denouncing the Pope as“this meddling priest,”with a reference to thesale of indulgences thrown in for good measure (3.1.81,89,90–3).86InHenryVIII, Archbishop Cranmer prophesies the triumph of Elizabeth and ulti-mately of James; yet it is a triumph cast as much in terms of secular asspiritual providentialism. The baby brought to Cranmer for baptism shallbe“A pattern to all princes living with her”; his“honour and the greatness ofhis name / Shall be, and make new nations”(5.4.22,51–2). Anti-Puritanpropaganda was another matter, though Shakespeare’s seems more con-cerned with the godly’s hostility to the theater than with making a deeperideological attack per se. Puritans were mocked in this way inTwelfth Night,where incidentally Shakespeare expected his audience to know who theradical sectaries were–Andrew Aguecheek inTwelfth Nightclaims hewould“as leif be a Brownist as a politician”(3.2.26).87But the limited appearance in his plays of representations of currentreligious politics in no sense indicates that Shakespeare’s work was disen-gaged from the language of belief. On the contrary, his plays are steeped inbiblical references, from both the Geneva and Bishops’Bibles.88For exam-ple, in the preparation for the duel at the end ofHamlet, Horatio commentsto his friend that“I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had85On Shakespeare’s unusual reluctance to take afirm religious stand in his plays in an age of widespread“confessionalization,”seeChapter2above.86All citations from Shakespeare’s plays are toThe Norton Shakespeare,2nd edn., ed.Stephen Greenblatt et al.

In a work likeHamlet, moreover, Shakespeare’sintertextual use of Scripture goes beyond mere individual allusions andactually tries to make serious demands on the doctrinal understanding of itsaudience.Hamletconfronts the old Catholic world, represented by theGhost who claims to be in Purgatory, with a prince trained inWittenberg, where he apparently absorbed the Protestant theology ofboth Luther and Calvin. In Hamlet’s eyes, therefore, men are inherentlydepraved, the elect saved only by God’s decree. His famous reference to the“special providence in the fall of a sparrow”(5.2.157–8) echoes closely apassage from Calvin’sInstitutes.89Hamlet’s paralysis of will in the face of thedemands of his dead father can be read as Protestant uncertainty about theexistence of Purgatory, and his later self-destruction as the consequence ofhis familial conflicts. The later confirmation of the Ghost’s truth-telling,especially the fact that he had died“unhouseled,”or denied his last rites, canalso be read as a way of justifying the staging of Catholic belief in the cockpitof Protestant England. As David Bevington stresses inChapter1above,Hamlet’s audience is offered alternative interpretations of the Prince’s fall:on the one hand, that of the protagonist himself, who by Act5comes toview his own drama and that of the world around him largely in terms ofProtestant providentialism; on the other, that of Horatio, whose perspectiveremains essentially secular, political, and humanist.90Adifferent way of looking at the tragedy of Hamlet’s madness is to locatethe play, as Stephen Greenblatt does, in a world of“maimed rites.”91Theunhouseled Ghost cannot be properly buried; Ophelia is brought to theground without ceremony; Hamlet jokes blasphemously about the eating ofPolonius’s corpse. The common experience of the liturgy, especially itspatterning of the rites of passage, was meant to provide a form of spiritualstability to Elizabeth’s subjects. Shakespeare shows how this might be so in89Based originally on Matthew10:29, Calvin’s passage reads:“by susteynyng, cherishing & caring for,with singular providence every one of those thinges that he hath created even to ye least sparow.”Theinstitution of Christian religion, trans.

Similarly, inRomeo and Juliet,Friar Laurence presides over a rite of marriage that the Book of CommonPrayer insisted upon as the essential part of true union.92Yet the regularenforced hearing of Cranmer’s words did not necessarily breed widespreadreligious harmony in late sixteenth-century London: to the godly, the Bookof Common Prayer was“the Mass book full of abominations,”while toothers it was an uncertain and sometimes inconsistent guide to forms ofChristian living and dying.93Many might have wished to reject it, but fewcould avoid assimilating its rhetorical structures.

Thequestion of why Shakespeare chose to end the play in such a troublingmanner has often been posed. To answer it more fully than hitherto, thischapter discusses a legend associated with Helena’s namesake, Helen ofTroy, and the ancient Greek lyric poet Stesichorus. Woven into the web ofclassical allusion withinA Midsummer Night’s Dream, this story also has adirect relevance to contemporary religious concerns about idolatrous per-ception, and echoes the play’s wider, Reformation-inflected anxieties aboutmisdirection and delusion.Hermia, Helena, and StesichorusThe names of the female lovers inA Midsummer Night’s Dreamhavereceived a good deal of critical attention. Commentators have particularlyremarked upon the fact that Shakespeare picked the name“Helena”for afemale character who is defined in large part by her seemingundesirability:after all, inside and outside Renaissance drama, the name more naturallysuggests Helen of Troy’s irresistible charisma.3Reasons for the pairing of“Hermia”and“Helena”have also been sought, one suggestion being thatthe name“Hermia”is a variation of“Hermione,”the name of Helen ofTroy’s daughter. Peter Holland, for instance, points to a line from Ovid’sArs Amatoria,“scilicet Hermionen Helenae praeponere posses”(“Wouldyou be able to prefer Hermione to Helena?”[2.699]) and suggests thatLysander’s line,“Not Hermia, but Helena I love”(2.2.119), can be read as ananswer to it.4While this reading is an attractive one, it has limitations takenon its own, particularly given the fact that mother–daughter relationshipshave no part in Shakespeare’s play.5A supplementary explanation for the names being paired, which alsohelps us to understand why a character called Helena should be portrayed asundesirable, can be found in the contemporary footnotes to EdmundSpenser’s series of pastoral poems,The Shepheardes Calender, one ofwhich tells the story of Stesichorus, a poet operating in Greece around thesixth centurybc, and his supposed preference for one“Himera”over Helenof Troy. The two shepherds speaking the eclogue for the month of Aprilrefer to a third shepherd, Colin, and his praise of the fair Rosalind.3Peter Holland remarks in his edition of the play (Oxford University Press,1994)thatHelena’s name“suggests most strongly Helen of Troy, whose beauty this Helena does not have”(p.143).4Ibid., p.61.5Shakespeare was to use the name“Hermione”later in his career inThe Winter’s Tale, again with noapparent reference to Helen’s daughter.82Alison Shell"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Commenting on this praise,“E. K.,”the author of the footnotes, remarksthat Rosalind deserves itno less than...Himera, the worthy poet Stesichorus his idol, upon whom heis said so much to have doted that, in regard of her excellency, he scorned andwrote against the beauty of Helena. For which his presumptuous andunheedy hardiness [audacity] he is said by vengeance of the gods (thereatbeing offended) to have lost both his eyes.The sequel to this episode, which E. K.’s footnote does not relate, is thatStesichorus composed a poetic apology to Helen and subsequently had hissight restored by the gods.6The idea that Stesichorus was in love with another woman namedHimera is a mistake, one that may have originated with the notoriouslyunreliable E. K. himself.7In truth, Himera is not a woman but a town inSicily, which, on account of being Stesichorus’s birthplace, was oftenmentioned in connection with him.8The town’s name can also be read asa pun on the Greek wordἵμεροςmeaning“desire”or“yearning.”9E. K.’smistake may show outside interference from another common classicalexemplar: it is a short step from“Himera”to“Hermia,”and“Hermia”was thought in the Renaissance to be the name of a prostitute whomAristotle loved. Though now known to be a ghost character arising from amisreading of the classical sources, Aristotle’s Hermia was quite real for earlymodern commentators and would have made a plausible counterpart toHelena, not least because both women had the reputation of beingunchaste.10A distant memory of this story might well have led E. K. tometamorphose the town of“Himera”into Stesichorus’s female“idol.”While Shakespeare could have followed the same train of thought6All quotations ofThe Shepheardes Calenderare from Douglas Brooks-Davies (ed.),Edmund Spenser:Selected Shorter Poems(London: Longman,1995).

K.’s footnote, it could have led himfirstly to connect the heroines’twonames, and then link these names with the tale of Stesichorus.11The fact that Stesichorusfirst criticized Helen but then came round toher gives us a classical precedent for what happens to Demetrius in thecourse of Shakespeare’s drama:first speaking against Helena, he ends upbecoming her advocate once his perceptions have been magically altered.This is all the more appropriate since, because of Stesichorus’s poeticapology to Helen, he is best known in literary history as the originator ofthe palinode, a literary genre signifying conversion and repentance.12Forinstance, theProverbsof Macarius (c.300–91) state that“Stesichorus sings apalinode: used of those who change their minds for the better.”13Plato’sdialoguePhaedrusgives perhaps the most authoritative commentary on thelegend, purporting to preserve Stesichorus’s actual palinode, which reads, asif to Helen:“This tale I told is false. There is no doubt: / You made nojourney in the well-decked ships / Nor voyaged to the citadel of Troy.”14Inthe accounts with which the twenty-first-century reader is most familiar,Helen is well known as the begetter of the Trojan War; but the apologyrecorded by Plato taps into an alternative mythological tradition in whichshe never went to Troy, instead remaining in Egypt while a phantom oreidolonin the shape of Helen journeyed on to Troy.15In some accounts thiswas an illusion created by Zeus, in others by the shape-changing sea-godProteus, in others still by Hera. Among ancient writers, Euripides developedthis alternative version of the story in his tragedyHelen.16And it was also a11On the play’s links withThe Shepheardes Calender, see Harold F.

So how helpful is it to import thisterm into the discussion of an early modern play? Turns of circumstance arebasic to plots of all kinds; drama would not exist without the idea ofperipeteia, or reversal. And even if something more is needed for a palinode–an element of repentance, of changing one’s mind, of unsaying–that stillleaves thefield unhelpfully wide: most of Shakespeare’s plays yield elementsthat might fall into this category. Nevertheless, Shakespeare’s use of namesinA Midsummer Night’s Dreamdoes suggest that he intended to make asharp, specific use of Stesichorus’s story and the commentary it generated;and this decision would have been an appropriate one for a play soclearly engaged with the issue of perception. The play’s comic misadven-tures are precipitated when Oberon takes offense at Demetrius’s failure toappreciate Helena properly and orders Puck to apply love-juice to the youngman’s eyes. When this happens, Demetrius is blinded in the sense that heloses touch with his former perceptions; yet in another sense the love-juicecauses his sight to be restored, in that he regains his initial desire forHelena.19transport the real Helen to the palace of the King of Egypt, near Proteus’tomb.

A typical early modern definition of the palinode canbe found in Thomas Blount’sGlossographia(1661):“a recantation, a contrary song, an unsaying thatone hath spoken or written, the sound of the retreat”(sig. Ff2r). The word was also used tomean“repetition”or“refrain”: seeOED’s etymology for“palinode, n.,”and also RichardLeighton Greene (ed.),The Early English Carols(Oxford: Clarendon Press,1977), p. xxxii.

The exchange between Hermia andHelena is particularly suggestive. Hermia says in wonder,“Methinks I seethese things with parted eye, / Where everything seems double,”to whichHelena replies,“So methinks; / And I have found Demetrius, like a jewel, /Mine own, and not mine own”(4.1.186–9). It is the last thing Helena says inthe play, leaving us with the impression not only that she cannot believe hergood luck, but that she fears being dispossessed of her beloved at anymoment. One can detect a note of unhappiness in this provisionality:another way of reminding us that Demetrius is still under the enchantmentof theflower-juice.Eidola and the conversion experienceUnlike Stesichorus, Demetrius both does and does not regain his formerperceptions after having had his sight supernaturally tampered with. Thisleads to the question of whether, in an exaggeration of Stesichorus’s tale,Demetrius actually ends up loving an eidolon, an imaginative phantomgoing under the name of Helen.20If so, the event would not be withoutprecedent in Renaissance drama. The most famous example, of course, isthe phantom Helen of Troy in Marlowe’sDr. Faustus, to whom Faustusaddresses the famous rhetorical question:“Was this the face that launched athousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?”21The answer isboth yes and no: Faustus is indeed looking at thefacethat launched athousand ships, but–for better-informed audience members at least–itwould have been open to question whether that face was Helen’s own orthat of a phantom look-alike. In any case, to complicate the matter further,Faustus does not experience the actual Helen here, but rather a diabolicallyinduced illusion. While no one’s soul is under threat inA MidsummerNight’s Dream, the notion of Helen as eidolon is still hauntingly present: notbecause Helena herself is unreal, but because Demetrius’s perception of herhas been magically altered.22Hence, as this chapter began by remarking, his20InHelen of Troy: From Homer to Hollywood(Oxford: Blackwell,2009), Laurie Maguire discusses howHelen’s beauty is defined by its effect on others.21Christopher Marlowe,Doctor Faustus,5.1.90–1(A-Text), quoted from David Bevington andEric Rasmussen (eds.),Doctor Faustus and Other Plays(Oxford University Press,1995).22On doubling in the play, see David Marshall,“Exchanging Visions: ReadingA Midsummer Night’sDream,”ELH,49(1982),543–75.86Alison Shell"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"union with Helena begs troubling questions–even though he publiclyrecants his former cruelty to her in an orthodox palinodic vein, and eventhough the public consequences of the match are everything one could hopefor in a comedy.Meditating the change from one love-object to another in tones of quasi-religious portentousness is a staple of love poetry and comic drama. We seeit inA Midsummer Night’s Dream, for instance, when Lysander wakes upafter Puck’s attentions, sees Helena, falls instantly in love with her, andcruelly repudiates his former beloved, Hermia:For, as a surfeit of the sweetest thingsThe deepest loathing to the stomach brings,Or as the heresies that men do leaveAre hated most of those they did deceive,So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,Of all be hated, but the most of me!(2.2.143–8)Many Renaissance poems, poetic sequences, and poetic careers chart amovement away from love and towards religion, another source of thecommon imaginative slippage between the two. All this made the notionof conversion both a comic and a gravely serious matter in early modernEngland, while the notion of the palinode, of turning and apologizing forprevious detractions, has considerable relevance to religious conversion atany date. Nothing is more important within the Christian agenda than theconversion from unregeneracy to repentance, and in the years of theReformation no subject was more high-profile than that of conversionbetween religious denominations. So within the context both of amorousand of religious discourse, the idea of changing an object of desire byanointing someone’s eyes withflower-juice is bound to suggest a facetiouslydeterministic notion of conversion. After all, at the time Shakespeare waswriting his comedy, the English Church’s prevailing Calvinist theology heldthat divine grace was entirely within God’s gift and that humans werepowerless to do anything to warrant it or seek it out.A MidsummerNight’s Dreamcould, then, possibly be read as parodying this view if onewere to interpret Oberon as God–an indictment, perhaps, of the switch-backs of the Tudor regime, or a commentary on the debate betweenadvocates of predestination and free will–but there are several problemswith reading the play as this kind of systematic, coded commentary on theEnglish Reformation.To illustrate why, it will be helpful to glance again at the poetry ofSpenser, notThe Shepheardes Calenderthis time butThe Faerie Queene,aDelusion inA Midsummer Night’s Dream87"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"work chronologically close to Shakespeare’s play.23Both the epic and thecomedy ask questions about being and seeming; both use the faery world asa crucible in which perceptions can be tested and problematized. But inSpenser’s work, false perception is insistently related back to the deceptionsof popery. When, for instance, readers are introduced to Archimago in hisreligious guise, they are told:“Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad, /.../Simple in shew, and voide of malice bad, /.../ And often knockt his brest,as one that did repent”(I.i.29, ll.5–9).24Nudgingly conditional–“seemde,”“in shew,”“as one that did”–these lines are a famous Spenserian caveat,cautioning againstfirst impressions. Archimago, as a director of spirits, is insome ways analogous to Oberon, and references to Catholic practice clusterround both: of Archimago, Spenser relates that“He told of Saintes andPopes, and euermore / He strowd anAue-Maryafter and before”(I.i.35, ll.8–9), and Oberon’s order to asperge the bridal chambers, discussed later inthis chapter, also contains strong Catholic overtones. But Archimago,unlike Oberon, is malevolent, and his characterization leaves one in nodoubt that magic, delusion, hypocrisy, and Catholicism are all closely andnegatively interrelated in Spenser’s world.25This Spenserian example allowsus to see what Shakespeare isnotdoing inA Midsummer Night’s Dream: notonly does he notflourish his Reformation credentials, but his designs on thereader are not those of an allegorist, even one as subtle as Spenser.AMidsummer Night’s Dreamis more plausibly read as an ironic commenton the comic consequences of thinking one has changed one’s mind oneself,when in fact it has been changedforone: an attitude that displaysShakespeare’s prevailing skepticism and could be applied to a wide varietyof cases, religious and secular.26However, the notion of eidola remains wide open to religio-polemicalapplication. In the context of the English Reformation, the term is bound torecall both the accusations of idolatry that thefirst reformers leveled atCatholics, as well as the broader way in which fears of idolatry could give a23Edmund Spenser,The Faerie Queene, ed.

Both inviteaccusations of misdirected worship that have a moral and religious inflec-tion as well as an amatory one.Helena herself, earlier in the play, shows she is well aware that her love ofDemetrius goes to sinful extremes:“And as he errs, doting on Hermia’seyes, / So I, admiring of his qualities. / Things base and vile, holding noquantity, / Love can transpose to form and dignity”(1.1.230–3). Preachersand moralists of the time did indeed counsel against lovers making idols outof one another: Thomas Adams, for instance, wrote that“Some make theirwife a goddesse, dote upon her with the extremest Idolatry: a faire colouredpeece of clay hath more worship then the Lord of heauen.”28In an age soacutely aware of misdirected worship and its perils, the play’s stress on therelativity of desire, the notion that an idol can be anything one makes it, is adeeply unsettling one. Looked at in this way, Helena is confirmed in sin bythe happy ending, while Demetrius is plunged into idolatry by the action ofthe spell: one recalls his exclamation onfirst seeing Helena after having hissight altered,“O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!”(3.2.137). Thedoubt about whether he loves an eidolon of Helen or the real Helenconfuses matters still further. Thus, although this is plainly a dramawhose plot depends on Demetrius’s turning back to Helena and27On Reformation notions of idolatry and iconoclasm, see esp.

It is intended to bring about marital happiness andprevent birth defects in the married couples’offspring–the reverse, in fact,of what was normally ascribed to faery intervention–but the word“stray”isjarringly pejorative, showing that Shakespeare does not treat Catholicnostalgia in an unequivocally positive manner.36As one of the play’s mostdirect commentaries on religious practice, this passage gives us a means ofcontextualizing Demetrius’s deluded devotion to the eidolon of Helena–though, as with this instance of the faery blessing, a clear party line is absent.and Fairy Stories(London: Allen Lane,2000), chs.3–5.

When he chants,“Upand down, up and down, / I will lead them up and down; / I am feared infield and town. / Goblin, lead them up and down”(3.2.396–9), Puck echoesan earlier speech that he delivers after giving Bottom an ass’s head andputting the other Rude Mechanicals toflight:I’ll follow you: I’ll lead you about a round,Through bog, through bush, through brake, through briar;Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,A hog, a headless bear, sometime afire,And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,Like horse, hound, hog, bear,fire at every turn.(3.1.88–93)Demetrius’s comment, early in the play, that he is“wood [i.e. mad] withinthis wood”(2.1.192), introduces the idea of the forest engendering mentalconfusion. Shakespeare may be pointing here to the notion of“panic,”originally understood as fear brought on by a forest;37and Puck couldcertainly be interpreted as having some of the attributes of Pan. But thefolkloric notion of being pixy-led has even more relevance to Puck’s particularagency and would have been closer at hand for Shakespeare’saudience.38Being pixy-led could simply refer to losing one’s way and wandering in circles,but it was also invoked in relation to the phenomenon ofignes fatui: methanegases, especially common in marshy areas, which had a misleading resem-blance to lanterns. Under this and other names–Will-o’-the-Wisp, JackO’Lantern–they were a real danger for the early modern traveler.3937Contemporary instances of the term“panic”in theOEDconfirm its strong association with Pan atthis date (see adj.1); thefirst use of the word in a looser sense (adj.2.a) is dated1603.38On the overlap between Will-o’the-Wisps and legends of Puck, see Jennifer Westwood andJacqueline Simpson,The Lore of the Land: A Guide to England’s Legends(Harmondsworth: Penguin,2005), p.492;cf.pp.318,502.

Their circular careers trace the erroneous path of Catholicism, intowhich Oldisworth is reluctantly drawn through his love for Bacon. Wishingfor Bacon’s reconversion but attracted to whatever path Bacon is following,Oldisworth uses the idea of being pixy-led as a metaphor for his spiritualconfusion without ever explicitly mentioning it:Could I but have his Comming home, & enterMy port with him, as well as I can venture,Did I not (like the Sun) transgresse my line,I would scorne Drake; but now, though I declineAnd rise againe, though upp & downe I bendI draw noe nearer to my journey’s ende:I runne a bootlesse Maze; and whirling soI stand-still faster than most men doe goe.As this illustrates, the experiences of being pixy-led and of theignis fatuusareamong those elements in faery lore that went beyond mere topoi and couldprovide a theme for literary compositions.

But here aselsewhere one must ask how apologetic such epilogues are really meant tobe; for Puck’s speech, like Stesichorus’s original palinode, is only apologiz-ing up to a point. Just as Stesichorus retracted his criticism of Helen bysaying that he was only speaking against her phantom look-alike, Puck isdeflecting opprobrious comment by saying that the audience have onlywitnessed the behavior of phantoms; he apologizes on those phantoms’behalf, but also says that, after all, nothing else can be expected of them.One should rememberfirstly that this is a play, and secondly, that it is a playcouched as a dream: both dreams and drama produce eidola, meaning thatplayers can, like dream-figures and indeed like fairies themselves, bedescribed as“shadows.”46Puck, like the rest, can be called an eidolon,which could work against taking him seriously. Nevertheless, it is throughhim that Shakespeare gives a mischievous pinch to contemporary prejudicesagainst idolatry, superstition, and the theater via the palinode, the apologythat is sometimes not really an apology; while at the same time the courtshipof Demetrius and Helena, inflected as it is by the story of thefirst palinode,complicates the relationship between being and seeming in a way thatwould have exacerbated Reformation sensitivities still further.46On fairies as actors, see Buccola,Fairies, pp.40,48,94.Delusion inA Midsummer Night’s Dream95"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"chapter 5The siege of Jerusalem and subversive rhetoricinKing JohnBeatrice GrovesThe famously patriotic ending ofKing Johnis a warning about the danger ofinternecine strife at a time of national danger:“This England never did, nornever shall, / Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror / But when itfirst did helpto wound itself.”1The phrase recalls–inter alia–the history of Jerusalem.Jerusalem’s destruction by Rome was attributed to the self-woundingreligious factionalism of its inhabitants, and its fate had been explicitlyconnected with the rebellion against King John inThe Homily againstDisobedience and Wilful Rebellion(1571). In this homily the English rebellion(incited by“Romish wolues”) is drawn as a parallel to Jerusalem’s fall toRome as an example of the calamitous results of disobedience springingfrom“ignorance ingodsword.”2The connection is likewise made inShakespeare’s main source,The Troublesome Raigne of King John(1591), astrongly anti-Catholic play which ends with afinal, rousing vision ofEngland’s glorious future as a new, Protestant Sion.3InTroublesomeRaigne, as King John prepares to relinquish his power to Rome, the portentsof Jerusalem’s fall hang in the English sky.4The message of these“Ensignes”is clear: the new Jerusalem (England) must unite against the Roman Churchor be destroyed just as the old Jerusalem had been by the Roman Army.1William Shakespeare,King John, ed.

When in the folio version ofKing Learthetwofinal couplets–spoken by Albany in the quarto version–are taken byEdgar, it is a sign that he has accepted the crown that Albany has offered.Prior to this point inKing John, the Bastard has exerted pressure on preciselythis issue of the necessity of conformity through the reversal of one itscentral tropes. As this chapter will illustrate, when the Bastard makes theMachiavellian suggestion that the besieging forces at Angiers should“Do like the mutines of Jerusalem, / Be friends awhile and both conjointlybend / Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town”(2.1.377–9), he isinverting a popular exemplum of contemporary homilies. The Bastard’s“iconoclastic idiom”is one of the joys ofKing John, but it is also crucial tothe play’s subversive stance on political and religious questions of its time.10The Bastard’s critique of the rhetoric of unity is part of his unique character-ization, but it is also part of the play’s own independent vision.Independence of mind inKing Johnis not a sign of dangerously hereticalopinions but evidence that Englishmen can maintain their identity andliberty while remaining loyal subjects. Preachers who threatened Englandwith the direful example of religious factionalism at the siege of Jerusalemwere inveighing against those (Catholic or Puritan) who rejected theElizabethan religious settlement. The history of Jerusalem’s fall was usedto suggest that independent spiritual choices would result in England beinginvaded by its enemies. The Bastard’s inversion of this trope implicitlyquestions such a conclusion. The truest, most loyal Englishman inKingJohnis also the one who keeps his independence and his integrity.11In the1580s and nineties the preoccupations of an island nation laboringunder the fear of Spanish invasion can be read in the performance of endlessbesieged castles, women, and cities on the early modern stage.12Thepervasive habit of mind which caused early modern Englishmen to cast10Rackin,Stages of History,p.185.11This positive interpretation of the Bastard is by no means universal, but it is becoming the dominantreading: Tim Spiekerman,Shakespeare’s Political Realism: The English History Plays(Albany: StateUniversity of New York Press,2001), p.52; Robert C.

The trope ofBritain as an island (a“precious stone set in the silver sea,”as Gauntfamously puts it) might seem a simple geographical description, but it isin fact very much an early modern phenomenon: inKing JohnEngland ispart of the Angevin Empire with lands on both sides of the Channel. Thefinal French possessions were lost under Mary Tudor, which meant theElizabethans were thefirst generation of Englishmen without any claims onmainland Europe. England’s conversion to Protestantism heightened herseparation in a predominantly Catholic Europe, but it also coincided withthe time when Britain became geographically isolated.The defeat of the Armada illustrates the extent to which England’s“separateness”was read as evidence for her destiny as the new Israel.England’s escape from Spanish invasion was seen as her equivalent of theIsraelite escape from Egypt, and English propagandists exploited to the fullthe coincidence that it was an east wind which had decimated the Spanishfleet, just as it was a strong east wind that had blown all night to part the RedSea (Exodus14:21).15The officialPsalme and Collect of Thankesgiuing(1588),for example, proclaimed:“The Lorde scattered them with his windes...thehelpe that is done by sea and by land, is his.”16Preachers likewise exultinglyproclaimed that God had enlisted the elements in England’s defense as hehad for hisfirst chosen people:“the Lord strong in battell was our refuge, theGod of Iaakob was our defence...The winds fought against them, andagainst their shippes, as they did against the shippes ofAhasia.

The dramatization of war reminds the audience that suchseemingly“providential”reversals in battle can occur to both sides.For many, however, the victory of the Armada was proof that Englishmenwere justified in thinking of themselves as the new Israel. The victory was readas nothing less than a covenant between God and his new Israel, a promisethat God would protect English Protestantism as he had protected his peoplein the Old Testament.19The unifying force of conceiving of England asGod’s“little Mount Sion”20was exploited to the full:That yeere ofEighty-Eight, ô neuer spare it,To blaze the praise ofThat yeere, all thy yeeres:Let English Isre’ll, sing and say allwayes,Not unto us, but to the Lord be prayse.21These apparently triumphalist parallels were, however, drawn because of aperception of England’s weakness as much as of her strength.

Patrick Collinson has noted howthe Psalter ameliorates the claustrophobic force of the original Hebrew ofthis phrase.23The Geneva Bible likewise, although it has a more accuratetranslation (“Ierusalem is builded as a citie, that is compact together in itselfe”), nonetheless glosses the word“compact”positively:“By the artificiallioyning and beautie of the houses, he meaneth the concord, and loue that wasbetweene the citizens.”Collinson argues that Protestantism’s clarion call tounity carried an implicit recognition that it had fractured English identity“bydividing along lines of formal religious division communities which werepreviously at least nominally at one.”24The highly regarded preacher JohnKing (who went on to become Bishop of London) ended his1594sermonseries on Nineveh with the wish that the“division [which] had well-nighbroken of late the heart-strings of religion amongst vs”should be overcomeand followed by“the peace of our Ierusalem.”25Fifty years later the radicalWilliam Sedgwick desired that London might be truly“the new Jerusalem...a City at unity in it self; there shall not be the least sound of discord in thee.”26The longing to embody the New Jerusalem, embraced by both King andSedgwick, is always a longing for unity, the desire that a factious countryshould become one, should be unified as“the house of the chosenIsraelites.”27Josephus wrote that internal dissension was the principal reason forthe Jewish defeat, asserting in the preface toThe Jewish Warthat“mycountry...owed its ruin to civil strife”(1.4). His stress on Jewishfaction may be read as providing a distraction from the disunity ofRome herself in the year of the four emperors. As suggested in DylanSailor’s brilliant analysis of Tacitus, Flavian propaganda presented Romeas ending Judea’s civil war while (in fact) using the Judean victory toend the Roman civil war.28Josephus’s reasons for stressing the factious22Charles H.

Preaching on Luke11:5(“Every kingdom that is divided in itself shall be brought to desola-tion”), he reminded his auditors that“when Vespasian the emperor andhis sone Titus came with an army against Hierusalem, the whole nationof the Jews was divided into three factions, each of them ready to undothe other. Then followed the overthrow of the kingdom.”30Josephus’shistory was used to admonish all who deviated from the establishedreligion: both Puritans and recusants were constantly reminded that“Ierusalemhad not so soone beene wonne byVespatianssonne, had itnot beene for ciuill discord within the Citie; and nothing more to beefeared for the ruine of our Nation, then ciuill dissention, domesticallfoes.”31In the anti-Martin Marprelate tracts those who might be temp-ted by Puritan arguments for rebellion against Episcopal authority werethreatened with Josephus’s direful history:“though the Iewes at thesiege of Ierusalem were pressed by theyr enemies without the walles, andpunished wyth such a mortalitie within, that the carkases of the deaddid dunge the grounde, yet they neuer went to the wall, till they grew tobe factious, & fell to taking one another by the throate.”32Religiousfactionalism was presented as having the most serious consequences, andsuch texts declared that conformity was a matter of national safety ratherthan individual conscience.The Bastard inKing John, however, uses Josephus’s account of the fall ofJerusalem rather differently.

In the year’s respite from hostilities that resulted from the death ofNero in the summer of68ad(because that led to an automatic cessation ofVespasian’s command) Jerusalem split into three factions.33The city wasdivided between the followers of John of Gischala, Eleazar, son of Simon,and Simon, son of Gioras. Josephus gives a graphic account of the blood-shed and suffering caused by their in-fighting, as well as the way thisinternecine strife led inevitably to the fall of the city to the foreign power.However, in the spring of70adTitus assembled his army near Jerusalem,and his approach temporarily united the warring factions:“And now for thefirst time the mutual dissension of the factions within the town, hithertoincessantly at strife, was checked by the war from without.”34The factionsjoined forces for a surprise attack on the tenth legion while the Romans wereoccupied with fortifying their camp, a sortie that proved a minor success.35The factions renewed their accord–“the parties, consigning their hatredand private quarrels to oblivion, thus became one body”(5.279)–and moremilitary success followed: John’s men undermined the Roman siege-worksthreatening Antonia and two days later Simon’s men likewise disabled someof the siege-engines at the western end of the north wall (5.466–90). Thispresentation of a united front forced Titus into ending his direct attacks,and he starved the inhabitants into surrender instead (5.491ff.).Josephus repeatedly reiterates that it is only the fear of Roman invasionthat enables the violent partisans to unite–suggesting a fractious force withno ultimate chance of success.

The siege of the Holy City was dramatized in two types of earlymodern siege-play: plays about the Roman destruction of the city–such asthe CoventryDestruction of Jerusalem(1584), Thomas Legge’sSolymitanaClades(c.1580), and the spectacularly successfulTitus and Vespasian(1592)46–and crusading plays such asHuon of Bordeaux(1593–4),Thomas Heywood’sThe Foure Prentises of London(1594), and the twoparts ofGodfrey of Bulloigne(1592–4). In the crusading plays, Christiansare retaking Jerusalem from the“infidel”and sympathy is rarely elicited forthe city’s inhabitants. In the plays about the fall of Jerusalem to Titus,however, the action plays out among the Jews rather than in the camp of thebesieging forces, and the horrors of the siege seem intended to elicit anatural sympathy with suffering vulnerability–such as is likewise inspiredfor the besieged Londoners in Heywood’sFirst Part of Edward IV(1599)orthe citizens of Antwerp inA Larum for London(1602). The Bastard hastaken a trope about Jerusalem’s fall to Titus and reimagined it in a crusadingcontext where victory is portrayed as triumph, not tragedy.The Bastard is a character whose theatrical heritage links him withbesiegers both of London and in the Holy Land. He shares his name withthe“bastard ofFauconbridge,”whose1471siege of London had beendramatized in theSiege of London(c.1580–94) and in Heywood’sFirstPart of Edward IV.47Falconbridge shares the name of one besieger and is thebastard son of another:“Richard, that robb’d the lion of his heart / Andfought the holy wars in Palestine”(2.1.4–5). The Bastard (who is rechris-tened Richard in his father’s honor [1.1.162]) is closely allied to the crusaderking: he has“a trick of Cœur de lion’s face”(1.1.85), shares his militaryallusion (Shaheen’sdefinitive work does not note it). Jesus’famous prophecy meant that for a longtime (despite contrary evidence in Josephus and the Holy Land) Christians continued to argue thatJerusalem:“twas beat quiteflat and plain to the Ground; exactly according to our Saviour,They shalllay thee even with the Ground,and thy Children within thee.”Samuel Wesley,The Life of our blessedLord & Saviour(London,1693), p.254.46Titus and Vespasian’s run at the Rose earned almost double Henslowe’s average takings at this time:E.

Richard I“wan diuerse townes and castels out of the enimies hands”on the thirdcrusade,49and the Bastard’s rhetoric at Angiers is designed to draw attentionto his connection with this famous besieger. Richard’s greatest militarytriumph was the siege of Acre (1191), and it is this siege that the centralaction ofKing Johnmost closely resembles. At Acre, the besieging parties (asat Angiers) included the English King, Philip of France, and the Duke ofAustria. At Acre (as at Angiers) these parties united to attack the city. AtAcre Richard (as his son does at Angiers) called Austria a coward andhumiliated him.50The Bastard creates an identity for himself by associating himself withRichard’s myth; but he also burnishes the tarnished aspects of that myth.When the Bastard takes back the famous lion-skin from Limoges, Duke ofAustria, he erases the memory (perpetuated by that trophy) of Richard’signominious and unnecessary death at Limoges’s hands.51Richard I, despitehis military prowess, was (and remains) a somewhat equivocalfigure. SamuelDaniel concluded that“hee exacted, and consumed more of this Kingdome,then all his predecessors from the Norman had done before him, and yetlesse deserued then any, hauing neither liued here, neither left behind himmonument of Pietie, or of any other publique work, or euer shewed loue orcare to this Common-wealth, but onely to get what hee could from it.”52Even if Richard is judged on military success alone, the third crusade is48The lion which was established as the coat of arms of English royalty by Richard I is associated notwith the King (as might be expected) but with the Bastard: C.

Honigmann notes that Falconbridge’s insults against Austria haveexactly the same tone as Richard’s (as they are rendered in the romanceKynge Rycharde Cuer du Lyon)“Home shrewed cowarde and go slepe.”King John, p. xxii.51Shakespeare has combined the Duke of Austria (whom Richard humiliated at Acre, and who laterimprisoned him) with the Viscount of Limoges.

Atthis siege King John tries to prove his right to the English throne, andEngland’s right to its European possessions, while the Bastard tries out hisnew identity as Richard I’s son. At Angiers the Bastard–by recalling (andimproving on) the myth of his father’s glorious victories in the Holy Land–is performing his self-chosen identity as Cœur-de-Lion’s son. The aggressivemisapplication of Josephus’s history is part of the Bastard’s rhetoricalcreation of himself as the son of a master of siege warfare.The Bastard’s unique interpretation of the Josephan trope is typical of theindependence of the stage bastard who, as Michael Neill notes,“repeatedlyinsists on his own self-begotten sufficiency.”55It is a trait that reaches itszenith in Falconbridge, who has willed his own bastardy and chosen aliminal status when he might have chosen to remain legally (and landedly)legitimate. At Angiers he“persistently subverts the shaping authority ofofficial language”just as his subversive asides–and repeated verbal taunts ofAustria–consistently disrupt the form and syntax of“the authorizedlanguage of chivalric heroism.”56Edward Gisekes, who explores the53Holinshed,Chronicles, vol.ii, pp.232–3. The idea that the third Crusade was a failure because it didnot result in the retaking of Jerusalem was voiced at the time: Gillingham,Richard I,p.4.54As John Watkins persuasively argues, the play presents the loss of John’s Angevin possessions as thebirth of an independent and“culturally, linguistically, and politically coherent England”:“it turnswhat might look like a national disaster–the loss of England’s French territories–into what mightlook like a national triumph.”“Losing France and Becoming England: Shakespeare’sKing Johnandthe Emergence of State-Based Diplomacy,”in Curtis Perry and John Watkins (eds.),Shakespeare andthe Middle Ages(Oxford University Press,2009), p.83.55Michael Neill,“‘In everything illegitimate’: Imagining the Bastard in Renaissance Drama,”Yearbookof English Studies,23(1993),284.56Ibid.,288.

Fifty years ago Emrys Jones argued that in hisfamous“commodity”soliloquy Falconbridge is playing with the terms ofearly modern homiletics and suggested that he could be seen as a mouth-piece for the questioning of dominant discourse:“through the character ofthe Bastard we seem to overhear some of the ways Tudor Englishmenprivately thought about the public events of their time.”60The currentcritical consensus is that the Bastard’s independent vision belongs to a moregeneral subversion of Tudor ideology inKing John.61David Womersley is convincing in his analysis ofKing Johnas a play whichespouses orthodoxy in a heterodox way: the Bastard’s loyalty to the crown(like his parentage) is not accepted as an absolute but presented as a willeddecision. The orthodoxy of his patriotism is a cloak for the heterodoxsuggestion that loyalty to king and country is something to which eachindividual needs to make their own intellectual assent (rather than acceptwithout question).62The inversion of the Jerusalem trope is likewise a57Edward Gieskes,“‘He is but a bastard to the time’: Status and Service inthe Troublesome RaigneandShakespeare’sKing John,”English Literary History,65(1998),794.58Julia C.

The Bastard’s sly inversion of a well-wornmoral message supports his own aggressive military endeavor, but it may alsopoint to the play’s skepticism about conformity. The Josephan story ofuniting factions was used to prove that strength was only to be found inreligious conformity. In the Bastard’s autonomy we hear the possibility ofsubjects rejecting the message they were meant to imbibe. The stage bastard,with his self-begotten sufficiency, is an embodiment–and in many ways acelebration–of those who chose to follow their own path. But while moststage bastards compound this independence with dubious morality,Shakespeare’s Bastard is not only afigure of dramatic power and politicalacuity but also of moral rectitude.63His exposure outside Angiers of the self-serving nature of the authoritarian imposition of unity is a counterweight tothe post-Armada rhetoric he endorses at the end of the play. In the BastardShakespeare has created a character who embodies a challenge to the idea thatconformity is the ultimate test of loyalty, a character who combines rigorousindependence of mind with an absolutefidelity to his king and country.Independence of outlook might have been thought of as subversive by thosewho enforced Elizabethan religious conformity, but inKing Johnit is theindependent thinker who is the greatest patriot.The orthodox end ofKing Johnresolves, but does not ultimately sup-press, the play’s argument for the freedom of those who chose to ignore theendlessly reiterated message that England’s safety necessitated the conform-ity of her subjects.King John’s anatomization of sectarian discourse (includ-ing this inversion of a ubiquitous homiletic trope) challenges the dominantrhetoric of its time. The actions, as well as the words, of the Bastarddramatize the oppositional idea that those who rebelled against conformityneed not be feared as enemies to the public good who might supportinvading armies rather than defend their country. As Womersley writes,“drama’s potential to be tentative, exploratory, and hypothetical hadallowed Shakespeare to stage forms of political action latent with heterodoximplication, and the consequences had been liberating in respect of boththeatrical art and political vision.”64In the Bastard Shakespeare created acharacter of great dramatic potency (his role–central yet choric, comic, andindependent–was to be developed by Shakespeare into both FalstaffandHamlet), but which also has wider political ramifications. Shakespeare’splay subtly endorses an idea which ran counter to the prevailing discourse ofthe age: that independence of mind and practice could coexist with apassionatefidelity to England.63Neill,“‘In everything illegitimate,’”270–92.64Womersley,Divinity and State,p.268.110Beatrice Groves"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"chapter 6Shakespeare’sJulius Caesarand the searchfor a usable (Christian?) pastPeter LakeOne of the most significant recent developments in the intellectual andpolitical history of post-Reformation England has been the recuperation of a“classical republican”or, in Quentin Skinner’s terminology,“neo-Roman”strand of political thought and feeling, which its discoverers want to placesomewhere near the heart of the political culture of the period. This strandof thought is classical in its origins and, in its early modern resonances,almost entirely secular.1It offers itself as a central explanatory tool for theexplication of the political arguments of the period in direct rivalry withaccounts centered on religious conflict as the motor for all the really seriouspolitical disagreements of the period. In this chapter I want to argue that inJulius Caesar2Shakespeare both reanimates and stages this neo-Roman,republican ideology and then tests it to breaking point by subjecting itnot merely to a secular historical and political critique, but also to areligious, indeed, a Christian critique. I willfirst examine the play’sRoman and secular view of politics and honor, and then, in the later stagesof the chapter, suggest some ways in which the play might be thought tobring the Christian sensibilities or impulses of itsfirst audiences into criticalengagement with those views.IIn recovering the play’s version of the neo-Roman view of politics, let usbegin with the scene in which Cassius attempts to broach the subject ofCaesar’s murder to Brutus.

To begin with, Brutusequates“honor”with service of“the general good”and locates the essenceof the honorable man in his capacity to risk his life in that service, and, ifnecessary, to choose death rather than dishonor. Cassius immediately takeshis cue from these remarks and produces his own disquisition on“honor”:I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,As well as I do know your outward favor.Well, honor is the subject of my story.I cannot tell what you and other menThink of this life; but for my single selfI had as lief not be as live to beIn awe of such a thing as I myself.I was born free as Caesar, so were you.(1.2.90–7)Here, then,“honor”is further associated with“virtue”and“freedom”andagain with the honorable man’s willingness to choose death rather thandishonor.“Freedom”here appears to mean not being“in awe”of any othermortal. To be reduced to such a state of dependent subordination, willinglyor no, is for Cassiusthegreat shame to which, for the honorable man, deathis always preferrable. Later soliloquizing on Brutus’s character, and on theways in which his traits might allow Cassius to bend him to his purposes,Cassius adds a third crucial term to the list:“Well, Brutus, thou art noble:yet I see / Thy honorable mettle may be wrought / From that it is disposed”(1.2.307–9). Here, then, we have“honor”and“nobility”being associatedtogether and linked with the service of the“general good”and with“free-dom”to form a nexus of interrelated terms.At another point in their dialogue, Cassius explains to Brutus that despitethe fact that Caesar is a mere mortal, as subject to the weaknesses of thefleshas any other man, he“is now become a God”; indeed, having got“the startof the majestic world,”he now“bears the palm alone”and his countrymenmust always“mark him, and write his speeches in their books.”So great hasCaesar’s preponderance grown that“Cassius is / A wretched creature, andmust bend his body / If Caesar carelessly but nod on him”(1.2.116–18,126,130–1). As he later tells Casca, despite the fact that Caesar is“a man no112Peter Lake"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"mightier than thyself, or me, / In personal action,”he is now“prodigiousgrown / And fearful.”Like the preternaturally violent storm then ragingabove their heads, Caesar“thunders, lightens, opens graves and roars / Asdoth the lion in the Capitol.”His arrogation of so much power has, ineffect, rendered Rome“a monstrous state”and reduced to the status of“awilling bondman”all those Romans who are prepared passively to acquiescein his dominance (1.3.71–8,113). Caesar’s greatness–the fact that he“dothbestride the narrow world / Like a colossus”–has reduced his countrymento mere“petty men,”walking“under his huge legs”“tofind ourselvesdishonorable graves”(1.2.134–7). In Cassius’s view, therefore, Caesar’sdominance has reduced the Romans to“bondage,”the polar opposite of“freedom.”Acceptance of that condition is the ultimate source of dishonor.On this view, Rome is already a tyranny and freedom has already been lost.Moreover, on Cassius’s account, the graves of those Romans who havesubmitted passively to this new dispensation will be dishonorable notmerely because their subjection to Caesar has rendered them servile, butalso because, by allowing one man such power, they have connived at,indeed, acquiesced in, the loss of their own freedom–and nothing could bemore dishonorable than that.Thus for Cassius the blame for the loss of their freedom rests primarilynot on Caesar’s but on the Romans’own heads. For Cassius, it is notCaesar’s preponderant virtue that has won him preponderant power in thestate but rather the Romans’lack of virtue, indeed their corruption, that hasceded such a wholly unnatural preponderance to him. As he tells Casca,And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?Poor man, I know he would not be a wolfBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep.He were no lion, were not the Romans hinds....What trash is Rome?What rubbish, and what offal? When it servesFor the base matter to illuminateSo vile a thing as Caesar?(1.3.103–11)Earlier Cassius had taken a similar tack to Brutus:The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our starsBut in ourselves, that we are underlings....Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feedThat he is grown so great? Age, thou art ashamed!Rome, thou has lost the breed of noble bloods!Julius Caesarand the search for a usable (Christian?) past113"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"When went there by an age, since the greatflood,But it was famed with more than with one man?When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,That her wide walks encompassed but one man?Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,When there is in it but one only man.O, you and I have heard our fathers sayThere was a Brutus once that would have brookedTh’eternal devil to keep his state in RomeAs easily as a king.(1.2.139–60)In his later exchange with Casca, Cassius makes the same point, only ingendered terms:“Romans now / Have thews and limbs like to theirancestors: / But woe the while, our fathers’minds are dead, / And we aregoverned with our mothers’spirits: / Our yoke and sufferance show uswomanish”(1.3.80–4). On this account, then, it was lost virtue that led tolost liberty, and the loss of liberty that is now leading to a further loss ofhonor and virtue. Rome has entered a cycle of decline from which, bothCassius and Brutus believe, it can only be rescued by the death of Caesar.From the manly Roman virtue and active service of the common gooddisplayed by their ancestors the current Romans have declined to a“wom-anish”subservience and passivity.Honor and nobility are thus a function of freedom and virtue; that is tosay, true nobility is displayed and honor acquired through the exercise ofvirtue in the defense or prosecution of the general or public good, in a statethat is not dominated by the power or authority of any one man.“Freedom”consists in the absence of such domination and in the free competition forhonor between a variety of autonomously noble and virtuous servants of thegeneral good. The resulting honor system is intensely emulous and com-petitive, but the result is not a“zero-sum”game. It is the combination ofcompetition and collaboration, of mutual respect and self-regard, thatdefines this honor code and community as republican. Men compete forhonor, but however great the achievements and virtues of any givenindividual, permanent dominance, still less institutionalized power, isnever to be ceded to any. The competition for honor must remain free,and in recognizing the genuine honor of–and indeed in ceding moralprimacy and even a form of political authority to–another bearer of trueRomanitas, the true man of honor does not deplete his own store of honorbut rather displays and thus augments it.

But Shakespearedoes not leave it there. Crucial to Roman honor, as he describes it, is anacceptance–indeed, in the right circumstances, an embrace–of death, upto and including the point of suicide. Confronted by the virtual certaintythat, as Casca explains,“the senators tomorrow / Mean to establish Caesaras a king, / And he shall wear his crown by sea and land / In every place savehere in Italy,”Cassius takes this as a sign of the certain arrival of tyranny andservitude to the Roman state. But this, he claims, is a form of“bondage”that cannot contain the likes of Cassius:I know where I will wear this dagger then:Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,No airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,Can be retentive to the strength of spirit:But life being weary of these worldly barsNever lacks power to dismiss himself.If I know this, know all the world besides,That part of tyranny that I do bearI can shake offat pleasure.3For early modern English notions of honor see, amongst a large literature, Mervyn James,Society,Politics, Culture(Cambridge University Press,1986), esp. chs.8and9; Richard Cust,“Honor andPolitics in Early Stuart England: The Case of Beaumont v. Hastings,”Past & Present,149(1995),57–94. The best overview of a complex subject is Keith Thomas,The Ends of Life(Oxford UniversityPress,2009), ch.5. While resonating with a range of contemporary Elizabethan attitudes, the play goesout of its way to construct a recognizably Roman, republican, and as we shall see below, pagan honorcode.Julius Caesarand the search for a usable (Christian?) past115"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"To which Casca replies:So can I.So every bondman in his own hand bearsThe power to cancel his captivity.(1.3.85–102)Here, then, is an acceptance of death’s inevitability and of the immutabilityof fate reaching its apogee, its logical end point, in the willingness of thegenuinely free man to cheat the tyrant by ending a life that had, through theloss of freedom, become the utterly dishonorable lot of a bondman and asubject, rather than that of a free Roman.Cassius’s sentiments prefigure those of Brutus expressed later in the playwhen, in another exchange with Cassius about the appropriateness ofsuicide as a response tofinal defeat and disgrace, he censures Cato“forthe death / Which he did give himself–I know not how.”For, Brutusexplains,“Idofind it cowardly and vile, / For fear of what might fall, so toprevent the time of life.”Until all else fails, it is incumbent on the man ofhonor to“arm himself”with“patience”and“to stay the providence of somehigh powers / That govern us below.”But that condemnation of thecowardice of a suicide undertaken prematurely, as a sign of“fear of whatmight fall,”itself comes in a speech in which Brutus declares his intention todie by his own hand if he is defeated by Antony and Octavian. Moreover, hejustifies that decision as having been informed“by the rule of that philos-ophy by which I did blame Cato”for his suicide.“Think not, thou nobleRoman, / That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. / He bears too great amind. But this same day / Must end that work the Ides of March begun”(5.1.100–13). In all this, Caesar, Cassius, and Brutus are repeating andclaiming as their own what Miles calls“orthodox stoic wisdom.”ForSeneca, suicide“is the last defense of the sapiens against fortune.”Thewise man knows that“life itself is an‘indifferent’thing”and is thus able,“ifit comes to a choice between life and virtue,”to choose virtue, honor and, itis to be hoped, an immortal Cato-like fame by taking his own life.4Thus, while the capacity to contemplate one’s own death with equanim-ity, up to the point of being prepared to end it oneself, is indeed a centralcharacteristic of the man of honor, such readiness to die should, in the trulyhonorable, be neither a cause nor a sign of an unmanly passivity beforeevents. For an enervating fatalism, a womanish“fear of what might fall”wasthe polar opposite of the active virtue that characterized the Roman man ofhonor. As the tragic fate of Portia shows, premature suicide was the4Geoffrey Miles,Shakespeare and the Constant Romans(Oxford University Press,1996), p.54.116Peter Lake"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"woman’s part. Genuine equanimity before the inevitability of death and theimmutability of fate should enable the honorable man to risk all for thegeneral good and, only in extremity, prompt him to choose death ratherthan dishonor: an option that should be taken only after all other availableavenues for the exercise of an active virtue, up to and including desperatelydangerous expedients–like those that start on the Ides of March andculminate at Philippi–have been exhausted. Only then, when confrontedby inevitable defeat and dishonor–represented here by the prospect ofbeing“led in triumph / Through the streets of Rome”(5.1.108–9)–can the“noble Roman”of genuinely“great mind”contemplate ending his own life.IIIHaving recuperated with extraordinary economy and precision inJulius Caesaralmost the exact lineaments of the ideology identified by Skinner as neo-Roman, Shakespeare then juxtaposes it against a pseudo-monarchical, indeeda proto-tyrannical, version of the sameideology, epitomized in the politicalmilieu around Caesar and openly expressed by Caesar’s megalomaniacal claimsto a superhuman version of Roman constancy, honor, and virtue. While thismight seem to tilt the moral balance in favor of the republican position,Shakespeare then proceeds to test to the breaking point the claims of repub-lican ideology that it provides the basis, within the moral and political circum-stances delineated by the play, for effective political action or rule. I say in theprecise circumstances outlined in the play because Shakespeare is very carefulto locate the action in a political society in the throes of change: ceasing to be arepublic, Rome has yet to become a monarchy. If Rome is still a republic, thenCaesar’s semiregal power in the state, compounded by what Brutus calls his“ambition”to become king, renders him not a legitimate prince at all but atbestausurper,atworstatraitortothestate,bentonunderminingtheveryprinciples of government that determine legitimacy in Rome. But if Caesar’srise to power has already changed Rome sothat it is no longer really a republicbut in fact some kind of incipient monarchy, then Calpurnia’s calling Caesar aprince is a simple statement of fact and the third and fourth plebeians’proposals, made immediately after Caesar’smurder,to“let Brutus beCaesar”and to“crown”Brutus (3.2.51–2) are not as ludicrous as they mightatfirst seem. Certainly, in that case, Caesar would be a legitimate ruler, andkilling him would be an act of treason.55See Robert Miola,“Julius Caesar and the Tyrannicide Debate,”Renaissance Quarterly,38(1985),271–89.Julius Caesarand the search for a usable (Christian?) past117"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"This constitutional liminality is reflected in the very different estimationsof the current condition of Caesar and of Rome to be found amongst theleading characters of the play. For Cassius, king or not, Caesar is already atyrant, a man whose de facto dominance of the political system has madehim“the only man in Rome”and thus reduced the rest of his erstwhilefellow citizens to a state of servitude. Cassius tries very hard to persuadeBrutus of this view of the matter, and in the famous soliloquy in the orchardBrutus tries very hard to persuade himself that Caesar is already a very badman, rendered a tyrant both by his current position in the state and by thecorruption of his own character, and therefore someone who thoroughlydeserves to die. But Brutus (let alone Cassius) entirely fails to persuadehimself of any of this. For him Caesar remains the noblest of all the Romans,a man whose current preeminence is a just reward for his supervening virtueand service to the state. It is just that that current preeminence must not begiven permanent institutional form in an offer of kingship. It is thus notwhat Caesar is but what he will become, or, more precisely, what hisbecoming king would do to Rome, that is the problem; it is thus his“ambition”to become a king that threatens to destroy the republic andthe cause of Roman liberty for good and all, and it is for that reason that hemust die.6Having toyed with more viscerally personal reasons to killCaesar, it is to that purely ideological, coherently republican, rationalethat Brutus reverts when he makes his pitch to the Roman people afterthe assassination. Thus if Antony, even as he conflates the bleeding corpseof Caesar with Rome itself, is clear that what has just happened is“treason,”so the conspirators are just as certain that it is a state-saving act of purgationthat has preserved“liberty”and averted“tyranny.”The ease with whichthe Roman people are convinced, in rapid succession, of both views of thematter might be taken as an index not merely of thefickle volatility of themob, but also of the extraordinarily volatile condition of the polity itself,caught in a limbo of betwixt and between, neither one thing nor the other.The play thus presents us with a society in the midst of the mostprofound political, moral, and ideological change. It also shows us agroup of malcontent nobles working themselves up to take action byresurrecting from the Roman past ideals of political virtue and liberty,nobility, and honor. When Cassius is ranting about the honor of the current6The binary choice between slavery and freedom, and the equivalence between those states and a Romewith Caesar alive and one with him dead, can be characterized, in Schanzer’s phrase, as“quite unreal,”or in Chernaik’sas“fallacious,”only if these basic republican premises are ignored.

In other words, he exhorts hiscontemporaries to emulate the zeal of those ancient Romans who had riskedtheir lives defending Rome from the tyranny of monarchy, and, in expellingthe Tarquins, founded the Roman republican state. In these exchanges,Cassius uses examples from the Roman past in precisely the way thatElizabethan readers and commentators were trained to do: that is to say,extracting certain exempla of moral or political virtue, certain political andmoral insights and apothegms, certain rules to live (and die) by, not merelyfor the moral instruction or improvement but for the active emulation ofcontemporaries.As Wayne Rebhorn and Coppélia Kahn have both emphasized, emula-tion was central to the process whereby Roman virtue is produced in theplay.7It involves the use of models of right behavior, of virtuous dedicationto the commonweal, culled both from the Roman past–videCassius’scitation of Brutus’s glorious forebear–and from the present. These modelsare then held up for imitation. The process is inherently competitive, theaim being not merely to copy or reproduce but to exceed the virtuedisplayed by the original. The same notion was equally central to humanisteducation in sixteenth-century England; as Kahn observes,“emulation asthe imitation of approved Latin authors was integral to Renaissance peda-gogy and poetics.”Again the process was inherently competitive, imitativeor emulous rivalry with the original“creating a competitive model ofappreciative emulation focused on outdoing the original text or precedent.”Emulation was“intended to teach judgment and analysis and was meant tocreate excellence of character as well of speech.”It transcended the realm ofrhetoric and became a social and a moral process. Vernon Dickson quotesGeorge Abbot to the effect that“it is not in rhetoric only that imitationholdeth, but in all the course of life.”8The play thus shows us the ancientRomans doing to one another, and with the Roman past, what Englishgentlemen were taught to do with the moral and literary examples of theancient Romans. It is just that in the play Cassius is using such modes ofargument and exhortation to persuade his fellow conspirators to an act of7Wayne Rebhorn,“The Crisis of the Aristocracy inJulius Caesar,”Renaissance Quarterly,43(1990),78–109; Coppélia Kahn,Roman Shakespeare(New York: Routledge,1997), pp.16–17.8Vernon Guy Dickson,“‘A pattern, precedent and lively warrant’: Emulation, Rhetoric and CruelPropriety inTitus Andronicus,”Renaissance Quarterly,62(2009),376–409(385–6).Julius Caesarand the search for a usable (Christian?) past119"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"annihilating political violence. He succeeds in doing that, and the play thenreveals the consequences of that success to be disastrous.9They are disastrous because Cassius and not Brutus is right about thecurrent moral and political state of Rome. Caesar’s dominance has strippedboth the Roman people and the political elite of their republican virtue.Rhetorical appeals couched in terms of the key words of republicanRomanitas(“liberty,”“tyranny,”“slavery,”and“Rome”) used as a synonymfor the free state, service to which was the cynosure of all true nobility andhonor, can no longer constrain the actions or compel the allegiance of eitherthe Roman people or key members of the elite, like Mark Antony. It isBrutus’s tragedy that throughout he frames all his political actions andcalculations on the assumption that the actions and reactions of his con-temporaries would and could be so constrained. As Joseph Simmonsobserves, he even assumes that“when Caesar is rooted out, so localized isthe state’s corruption that even Antony will either be regenerated or die.”10It is as though once Caesar and the prospect of kingship have been removedfrom the scene all the organizing assumptions and constraints of therepublic will snap back into place and the rule of men of the greatesthonor and nobility–amongst whom, of course, Brutus assumes himselfto be preeminent–will be assured.It is this assumption that prompts all Brutus’s fatal political mistakes: hisdecision not to include Antony on the original hit list; his belief that, afterthe murder of Caesar, even Antony can be co-opted and morally coercedinto collaboration with the restored republican clique; his assumption thathis own sternly republican pitch to the Roman people will work so defin-itively that thereafter Antony can be safely entrusted with the funeraloration. Not only that, but it is the cult of Roman republican honor,operating within and between the conspirators, that ensures that, at allthe really crucial moments, it is always Brutus’s (politically mistaken) viewof the matter that prevails, and the greater political sagacity and military skillof the palpably less honorable Cassius that loses out. In the confrontation atSardis, Brutus’s brutal performance of his superior virtue reduces Cassius tothe position of moral inferiority from which he feels compelled to let Brutushave his way over how and where to engage the enemy, with disastrousconsequences for the republican cause. It is as though the more perfectly the9For more on the widespread use of imitative reading practices in Shakespeare’s day, and especially theapplication ofexemplafrom classical history to contemporary problems, seeChapter5above, onKingJohn.10Joseph Larry Simmons,Shakespeare’s Pagan World: The Roman Tragedies(Charlottesville: UniversityPress of Virginia,1973), p.99.120Peter Lake"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"conspirators manage to recuperate and perform republicanRomanitasandhonor, the more mistakes they make.As a number of commentators, perhaps most notably Sigurd Burckhardt,have observed, what seems to be at stake here is a question of timing.11In acrucial line, Cassius reassures Brutus that“men at some time are masters oftheir fates”(1.2.138). The basic political questions the play poses are,firstly,is this true? And, secondly, even if it is true, how can we best tell the time?By what criteria might men decide whether and when the time, their time,is ripe? Certainly what the play shows us is a group of men of no incon-siderable virtue–the audience is surely meant at least partially to shareMark Antony’s judgment, delivered over Brutus’s corpse, that“this was thenoblest Roman of them all”–who have decisively got their timing wrong.By applying a carefully reconstructed and exquisitely performed version ofantique Roman virtue and republican honor to a set of circumstances inwhich such virtues are no longer salient, the conspirators not only fail torealize their objectives, they ruin the very state they have been trying to save.Far from being saved from tyranny, Rome is pitched into a violent civil war,the result of which (as any contemporary audience would have known)would be the emergence of an imperial polity far more monarchical, andarguably far more tyrannical, than anything Julius Caesar would have beenlikely to visit on the vestigial remains of the republican polity that hadproduced him. The play operates, then, as a dreadful warning about themisapplication of a set of historical lessons drawn from a classical Romanrepublican past to a set of political circumstances to which they are whollyinappropriate.IVWe have here an entirely secular, this-worldly account of the failure ofrepublican ideology to work in the circumstances delineated by the play.Given the pagan classical sources for the play and the ideology it is depictingwith such close attention, and the relentlessly secular account of the earlymodern period produced by scholars of political thought who have put suchtime and effort into reconstructing the neo-Roman view of the world, that isprecisely what we might expect. But Shakespeare does not just leave it there.ForJulius Caesaris a play notoriously suffused with the supernatural. Aplethora of prodigies and prophecies, of omens and curses, recur through-out the action. Perhaps the most overtly prophetic of the prophecies is the11Sigurd Burckhardt,Shakespearean Meanings(Princeton University Press,1968), pp.5–9.Julius Caesarand the search for a usable (Christian?) past121"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"pronouncement of the soothsayer about the Ides of March. Not far behindcomes Calpurnia’s dream foretelling the death of Caesar. This, of course, isseconded by the results of the augurers’sacrifice. Antony’s vision of aRoman world torn asunder by the devastations of civil war is part prognos-tication, part curse, and part prophesy. Artemidorus’s warning to Caesar(2.3.1–6) is not so much a prophesy as a tip-off, but even here Artemidorusmakes the outcome of his efforts to forewarn Caesar a test of the role of thefates in deciding the course of human affairs:“If thou read’st this, O Caesar,thou mayst live; / If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive”(2.3.14–15).As for portents and prodigies, the play has no end of them. Chief of these,of course, is the prodigious storm that rages the night before Caesar isassassinated. A range of different characters attests to the extremity of thisevent and to the extraordinary prodigies and portents with which it isattended. Casca reports a series of wonders to Cicero, reports which areconfirmed by Calpurnia’s account of the same or similar events to Caesar(1.3.5–28). Later in the play, Brutus is visited by Caesar’s ghost,“a mon-strous apparition”that“mak’st my blood cold, and my hair to stare”(4.3.275–8). Immediately before the battle of Philippi, on his birthday,Cassius reports what he now takes to be an omen to his intimate Messala:Coming from Sardis, on our former ensignTwo mighty eagles fell and there they perched,Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’hands,Who to Philippi here consorted us:This morning are theyfled away and gone,And in their steads do ravens, crows and kitesFly o’er our heads and downward look on usAs we were sickly prey.(5.1.79–86)While most of the characters in the play are convinced that these portentsand wonders must mean something, they are entirely incapable of decidingjust what that might be. Thus Casca exclaims that“when these prodigies /Do so conjointly meet, let not men say, /‘These are their reasons, they arenatural’: / For I believe they are portentous things / Unto the climate thatthey point upon”(1.3.28–32). But his awestruck claim that“it is the part ofmen to fear and tremble / When the most mighty gods by tokens send /Such dreadful heralds to astonish us”(1.3.54–6) is met by Cicero’s somewhatdownbeat reply,“But men may construe things after their fashion / Cleanfrom the purpose of the things themselves”(1.3.34–5).Significantly, it is the play’s most consistent and rigorous bearers ofrepublican honor who are least impressed, or indeed intrigued, by such122Peter Lake"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"seemingly supernatural pyrotechnics. Awe-inspiring portents to Casca, suchprodigies provide Cassius with another occasion to display his constancy ofmind, a crucial aspect of which is a decided absence of awe:For my part, I have walked about the streets,Submitting me unto the perilous night,And thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see,Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone:And when the cross blue lightning seemed to openThe breast of heaven, I did present myselfEven in the aim and veryflash of it.(1.3.46–52)Asked by Casca,“But wherefore do you so much tempt the heavens?”(1.3.53), Cassius uses the question as the starting point for another rantabout the way the unnatural preponderance of Caesar has turned Rome intoa veritably“monstrous state”(1.3.62–71). For Cassius, then, the prodigies ofthe storm are notfit objects for wonder or fear; they do not presage horrorsto come, so much as prompt present action–the very action, in fact, whichhe is already bound and determined to take.Brutus is even less alarmed than Cassius by the“exhalations whizzing inthe air”(2.1.44). Trapped between what he later calls“the acting of adreadful thing / And thefirst motion”(2.1.63–4), deep in reverie aboutwhat must be done about Caesar, Brutus remains entirely unconcernedabout the meaning of these prodigies. Instead of pondering the storm as apossible sign regarding his, Caesar’s, or Rome’s fate, he merely uses the lightshed by the lightning to read the anonymous missives sent to deceive him byCassius and his accomplices.Indeed, until the very end, Brutus and Cassius sustain a position ofsettled indifference to such concerns. Before Philippi, even as Cassiustakes the“ravens, crows and kitesflying o’er our heads”to be some sortof omen–“a canopy most fatal, under which / Our army lies, ready to giveup the ghost”–he also tells Messala that“I believe it but partly, / For I amfresh of spirit and resolved / To meet all perils constantly”(5.1.89–91). Evenas Brutus is confronted by the specter of Caesar’s ghost, while he sweats infear and his hair stands on end, he maintains an exemplary constancy ofmind in the face of the“monstrous apparition.”Unsure of what it is–hisquestion,“Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil?”remains, fornow, unanswered–its claim that it is“Thy evil spirit, Brutus”and that“thou shalt see me at Philippi”elicits only the response,“Why, I will seethee at Philippi then”(4.3.275–84). Indeed, the attitude expressed by Brutusto Cassius on the eve of battle represents something like the quintessence ofJulius Caesarand the search for a usable (Christian?) past123"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Roman honor as delineated by the play. Brutus starts out wistfully:“O thata man might know / The end of this day’s business ere it come.”But that, heknows, is a fond wish.“But it sufficeth that the day will end, / And then theend is known”(5.1.122–5). Facing an unknowable fate, the man of constantmind, knowing that death is certain, must be ready to embrace and facedown any eventuality. The worst that can happen is death, and death isinevitable. Learning of Portia’s suicide, Brutus observes that“We must die,Messala: / With meditating that she must die once / I have the patience toendure it now,”a remark which draws from Cassius the entirely admiring,even awestruck, comment that“I have as much of this in art as you, / Butyet my nature could not bear it so”(4.3.188–93).The play, then, presents us with a variety of pagan Romans, all of whomhave been taught by the demands of Roman virtue and the dictates of“philosophy”to regard any concern with prodigies, portents, or propheciesas“superstition.”They have also been taught to regard fate as unknowableand the best way to meet it an acceptance of the inevitability of death; anacceptance that, by fortifying one against fear of the unknown and thetergiversations of fortune, leads not to fatalistic passivity but rather to anactive pursuit of virtue and honor, safe in the knowledge that, if all else fails,one can choose death rather than dishonor or servitude and, by dying byone’s own hand, cheat both tyranny and fate. That certainly is the viewtaken throughout by Brutus, Cassius, and Caesar and in the end is actedupon by both Brutus and Cassius. There is, then, a sense in which suicide–the capacity and willingness, in the face of a malign and unknowable fate, tochoose death rather than dishonor–represents the coping stone in the archof the pagan philosophy and Roman honor politics attributed by the play toall its central characters.On this view, attention paid to the sorts of prodigies and prophecieswhich suffuse the play amounts to what Cassius contemptuously describesas“superstition.”That claim occurs in a speech in which Caesar is said tohave grown superstitious only“of late.”Clearly, Caesar’s attitudes to suchthings are changing, and in this he is not alone. Calpurnia enters claimingthat“I never stood on ceremonies, / Yet now they fright me”(2.2.13–14).Cassius, too, by the end can be found telling Messala that he has changedhis mind on the subject of portents and prophecies:“You know that I heldEpicurus strong / And his opinion: now I change my mind / And partlycredit things that do presage”(5.1.76–8). Of all the centralfigures in theplay, it is the virtuous Brutus who is the last to come to such a change ofheart. Only at the very end, when all is lost, does he admit that his end hasbeen foretold:“The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me / Two several124Peter Lake"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"times by night: at Sardis once, / And this last night, here in Philippifields: / Iknow my hour is come”(5.5.16–19). Earlier, coming upon Cassius, slain byhis own hand, Brutus had exclaimed,“O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet./ Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords / In our own proper entrails”(5.3.94–6). With his dying breath, Brutus again acknowledges the hand offate in his own end:“Caesar, now be still. / I killed not thee with half sogood a will”(5.5.51–2). Brutus’s dying words pick up those of Cassius, whoimmediately before he dies cries,“Caesar, thou art revenged / Even with thesword that killed thee”(5.3.45–6).Thus the play also shows us each of the central characters unlearning thelessons of (pagan) philosophy, Roman virtue, and republican honor–coming, in fact, to believe in what Calpurnia calls“ceremonies”and whatCassius calls“things that do presage”and“superstition.”And it shows usthat they are quite right to do so. After all, all the prophecies with which theplay is studded come true. Caesar should have been wary of the ides ofMarch; he does die under the daggers of his countrymen, as Calpurnia hasforeseen; he should have looked out for Brutus, Cassius and the rest;subsequent to his death the Roman world is plunged into a bloody civilwar, as Antony prophesies. The portents, too, prove the true harbingers of avariety of the disasters that at least some of the characters take them to be;the prodigies of the night before Caesar’s assassination have indeed“blazedforth the death”of a prince; the crows and kitesflocking above the repub-lican army at Philippi and the visitation of Caesar’s ghost as Brutus’s“evilspirit”do indeed mean that the conspirators’number is up. Having set outto slay“the spirit of Caesar”(2.1.166), Brutus and Cassius succumb to therevengeful attentions of that very spirit, killing themselves with the sameswords with which they had cut Caesar down.What, to the philosophy espoused by Brutus and Cassius, looks likesuperstition, is thus presented by the play as something indeed that anyElizabethan audience, inured to the structuring assumptions ofinnumerable tracts, sermons, and indeed plays, would have identified asthe operation of providence, to whose (both admonitory and punitive)interventions into events, it was anything but“superstitious”to attend.12As has been argued above, the depiction in history plays and tragediesof the operations of providence, in particular through the framingpresence of prophecies, prodigies, and portents, allows the audience access12The seminal account of early modern English attitudes to providence is to be found inAlexandra Walsham,Providence in Early Modern England(Oxford University Press,1999). Onprodigies and prophecies, see esp. ch.4.Julius Caesarand the search for a usable (Christian?) past125"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"to what the play presents as the patterning of events by providence that is farmore complete and panoptical than anything available to any of thecharacters. Ceded, through the operation of such providences, somethinglike a God’s-eye view of the action, the audience can indulge in processes ofjudgment–moral, theological, political–that constitute, inside their ownheads, what we might take to be the meta-argument of the play. Certainlythey can see as“providential”things that are ignored or misunderstood bythe characters on stage. One thinks of the repeated pattern whereby,disagreeing about what to do next, Brutus always wins the argument andalways with disastrous results. Armed with the providential frameworkprovided to them by the play’s insistent pattern of portents and prophecies,the audience might well see this not only as a commentary on the contra-dictions between, say, the politics of honor and faction, or even between thecharacters and moral qualities of Brutus and Cassius, but as an expression ofa providential patterning of events, which uses the dominant characteristics(in Christian terms, the defining“sins”) of the centralfigures to frustratetheir own (sinful) purposes, bringing the conspirators to judgment anddeath at Philippi, even as the sins of Caesar and Rome have been punishedin their turn by the conspirators’resort to political violence and all itsdreadful consequences. Built into such a providential reading of the playwould be the extraordinary blindness of the leading characters in the face ofthe signs and prophecies provided to them, which, if heeded, would havesaved them from the fates visited upon them by the play’s end. Such failuresto see things literally thrust in their faces by providence could themselves beseen as“providential.”For here was providence using the sins and weak-nesses of these men to bring them to punishments that their sins haddeserved and that, however clear the warnings that they had been vouch-safed by heaven, their own (fallen) capacities had been entirely unable toperceive, let alone avert. Having been warned, and having ignored thewarning, they were thus doubly culpable.Such a reading of the play’s action would, of course, be an intenselyChristian one, predicated on the existence of an omnipotent and immu-tably just and merciful God whose both mysterious and beneficent purposescould be seen working their way through the events of human history, inways that not merely conferred meaning and coherence on those events butsent messages of admonition and exhortation about that meaning andcoherence to all those with eyes to see. But the play, of course, is notabout Christians, but Roman pagans, exponents of an entirely paganphilosophy. It is true that that philosophy, as the play stages it, has some-where near its heart notions of“liberty”and“justice,”of“nobility”and126Peter Lake"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"“honor”entirely recognizable to a Christian audience as moral goods. It alsoprominently features a concern with the nature of the good death and of theneed to square the purposes of humanity with the dictates and outcomes ofa fate that no human can penetrate that parallel quite closely the centralconcerns of many sixteenth-century Christians. But still it has no place forthe omnipotent Christian God and no place, therefore, for providence asChristians constructed and applied it to their lives and times; no place,either, for the immortal Christian soul, nor for any concept of an afterlife inwhich salvation and damnation depend on some combination of theoperations of divine grace and the conduct of the individual in this life.None of the characters show the slightest regard for their fate in the nextlife. Insofar as it means anything to them, immortality is a function ofimmortal fame, something to be won by honorable service to the republicand the public performance of true honor and nobility, even in the face ofdeath. Immediately after the murder of Caesar, Brutus and Cassius imaginetheir deed winning them fame down the centuries as it is played out in“sport”upon the public stage:“So oft as that shall / So often shall the knot ofus be called / The men who gave their country liberty,”crows Cassius(3.1.114–19). It is, of course, one of the many ironies in which the playabounds that this very play is itself contributing to the process whereby suchan immortal fame is conferred upon Caesar’s killers. But, as the play shows,they have become famous not for having“given their country liberty,”which, after all, is something that they signally fail to do, but rather forgiving their all in the service of what they take to be the general good andthen meeting honorable deaths, when all is lost, at Philippi.These of course were not positions or opinions open to the ElizabethanChristians that made up the play’sfirst audiences, whom the play constructsas Christians by enabling, even inducing, them to place the (inherentlyChristian) providential frame, afforded them by the prophecies, prodigies,and structural symmetries of the plot, around the (decidedly un-Christian)doings of the Roman, pagan, and republican protagonist of the play. Putcrudely, the audience could see more than the characters not merelybecause, given the fame of the play’s subjects, they already knew the out-come, nor because, as the audience, they were situated outside the action,and thus able to see the overarching structures of the plot in ways that thecharacters simply could not–but also because they were Christians. Thusthe audience’s application of their own (at least residually) Christian her-meneutic impulses to the providential signs that structure and commentupon so much of the play would have served as a constant reminder of thecultural gap that separated the pagan and republican Rome being staged inJulius Caesarand the search for a usable (Christian?) past127"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"the play from the Christian and monarchical world in which the play wasbeing staged.13If we take the providential view upon which the play virtually insists, wemight ask, if the play’s outcome represents a series of judgments, upon whatsins precisely have those judgments been visited? A conventional answerwould be the violent resistance, regicide, and rebellion of the conspirators.But as we have seen the play is carefully structured to render such a patresponse unavailable. We are left with the conclusion that the providentialjudgments staged in the play are being visited not on the perpetrators of“resistance”but rather on the perpetrators of a certain sort of politicalmistake, a mistake predicated on a disastrously anachronistic and over-literal reading of classical republican notions of honor, liberty, and politicalvirtue onto a political context in which they no longerfit.VAnd, of course, what applies to the republican faction in the world of theplay would have applied in spades to any contemporary Elizabethan polit-ical actors, who, stimulated by their readings from the classical past, werethinking about applying insights and principles gleaned therefrom toodirectly to contemporary problems and conjunctures. And that in1599was a decidedly threatening possibility. With the prospect of the queen’sdeath without a settled successor looming, and the question of peace withSpain an open and vigorously debated question, both at court and in thepublic sphere described by circulating manuscripts, Elizabethan Englandappeared to many contemporaries to be a polity influx.14With the Earl ofEssex known to be chafing under the rebukes of the queen, and standing onhis honor as a nobleman and servant of the commonweal as he did so;15with his Irish expedition crashing and burning and with wild rumorsabout events there in circulation and speculation about his intentions13A number of chapters in this volume consider the role of providence in Shakespeare’s plays, e.g.Chapter1onHamlet,Chapter8onLear, and bothChapters12and13onHenry VIII.14Alexandra Gajda,“Debating War and Peace in Late Elizabethan England,”Historical Journal,52(2000),851–78. Essex’sApology, a manuscript outlining the reasons for his opposition to the peace,was in circulation at precisely this period.15This was well known because of the circulation in manuscript in1598of an exchange of letters betweenEssex and Egerton. This had been occasioned by an extraordinary scene between Essex and the queen inthe course of which she had boxed his ears and he had turned towards her with his hand on the pommelof his sword, before storming out of the room. Egerton responded with a letter counseling caution andaccommodation, Essex with a shrill self-justification, which proceeded to do the rounds as some sort ofmanifesto for his honor and independence. The letters are reprinted in G.B.

Developing upon a seminalarticle written by L. C. Martin in1945which focused mainly onMeasurefor MeasureandKing Lear, a small number of scholars have argued that theinfluence ofDe Rerum Naturacan also be found in other works byShakespeare, includingTroilus and Cressida,Venus and Adonis,andAMidsummer Night’sDream.3In what follows, I want to develop this argu-ment further.Lucretius’s poem is, of course, deeply rooted in Epicurean philosophy.But it is also a distinct philosophical document in its own right, one thatoffered a number of potent challenges to certain aspects of early modernintellectual culture. This is particularly the case in relation to the dominantreligion of early modern England, Protestantism. In what follows, therefore,I want to examine more fully the relationship between Lucretian philosophyand the Calvinist theology that predominated in England from the midsixteenth to the early seventeenth century.4In particular, I want to use thisinterface as a way of thinking aboutMeasure for Measure. Of course, this texthas been frequently discussed in relation to early modern theology, espe-cially Calvinism.5Yet, so far, no one has examined the play’s theologicallanguage in relation to its equally extensive engagement with Lucretius.Martin showed that much of the Duke’s famous Act3speech on death isdrawn from bookiiiof Lucretius.6But the play’s Lucretian engagements gowell beyond this one speech. Given the Roman poet’s well-known antipa-thy towards institutional religion, the connection is worth pursuing. I wantto suggest that throughout the play, Shakespeare pits the claims of Lucretian3Langley,Narcissism, pp.74–5; Shoaf,“‘If imagination,’”passim.4On the centrality of Calvinism in early modern England, see e.g. Alan Sinfield,Literature in ProtestantEngland1560–1660(London: Croom Helm,1983); Nicholas Tyacke,Anti-Calvinists: The Rise ofEnglish Arminianism c.1590–1640(Oxford University Press,1987); Brian Cummings,The LiteraryCulture of the Reformation(Oxford University Press,2002); and Adrian Streete,Protestantism andDrama in Early Modern England(Cambridge University Press,2009).5Thelocus classicusof such approaches is G.

But it is also clear that writers understood Lucretius’s poemas a separate and important offshoot of Epicureanism, one with its owndistinct and problematic philosophy. Parts of the text ofDe Rerum Naturawere known to medieval scholars, and he is often referred to in philosoph-ical and literary works from the ninth century onwards. A full copy of thetext was rediscovered in1417and printed in a number of Latin editions.Early Renaissance Italian humanists like Marsilio Ficino and Lorenzo Valla,while expressing admiration for Lucretius as a literary stylist and acknowl-edging the persuasiveness of some of his ideas, nonetheless struggled toreconcile his version of Epicurean philosophy within a Christian frame-work. As Jill Kraye notes, a particular difficulty was presented by the ideathat human pleasure was the supreme good.9This struggle can be observedin a number of early modern English texts.A great deal of the hostility towards Lucretius arose from a misunder-standing, sometimes willful, sometimes not, of his Epicurean doctrine ofataraxia(calmness or tranquillity). While some commentators recognizedthe essentially philosophical nature of this commitment, many more tookthis doctrine to imply devotion to sensuous pleasures, luxury, and vice. In7For a different reading of a Shakespeare play that appears to be pitting a recovered classical beliefsystem against the tenets of early modern English Protestantism, seeChapter6above, onJulius Caesar.8For Lucretius’reception in the early modern period, see Jill Kraye,“Moral Philosophy,”inCharles Schmitt et al.

It may signifie the whole estate of mans life, neuer setled,neuer satisfied, euer dooing and vndooing, and dooing almost all, to nopurpose at al.10In this reading, fairly typical of the anti-Lucretian argument, Frauncerepresents the Lucretian subject as one in thrall to drives that cannot betamed or regulated. The fact that these drives lead to a conception of life ashaving“no purpose at al”seems especially concerning: is there a place forprovidence in such a system? Another example is found in a1606tractwritten by Joseph Hall calledHeauen vpon earth, or Of true peace, andtranquillitie of minde. As his title suggests, Hall’s Christian defense oftranquillity reveals the extent to which the intellectual fascination withLucretianataraxiawas seen by many Protestants as profoundly dangerous.Contrary to Lucretius’s claim that death should inspire no terror, Hall saysthat“Neither prophaneLucretius, with all his Epicurean rules of confidence,nor drunkenAnacreon, with all his wanton Odes, can shift of the importu-nate, and violent horror of this aduersarie.”11Here Lucretius is seen as afoolish dilettante whose philosophy of tranquillity induces false hope inhumans; when it comes to confronting mortality, the“violent horror”ofChristian eschatology is to be preferred. For some early modern Protestants,then, such views confirmed the commonly held view that all Epicureanthought is damnable and atheistic.Writers and thinkers were alternately fascinated and appalled byLucretian cosmology, not least because it challenged the predominantlyAristotelian basis of the physics taught in the universities and that under-pinned so much Christian theology. In addition to stating that there areinfinite numbers of worlds, Lucretius denies providence, rejects creationexnihilo, and refutes the immortality of the soul. Yet while attitudes towardsLucretius were generally wary, they were also not universally negative.William Hamlin has demonstrated the various ways in which“scepticismenters the lexicon of English poets and intellectuals”in the late sixteenth10Abraham Fraunce,The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch Entituled, Amintas dale.(London: Thomas Woodcock,1592), p.31v.11Joseph Hall,Heauen vpon earth, or Of true peace, and tranquillitie of minde(London: Iohn Windet forSamuel Macham and Matthew Cooke,1606), pp.100–1.134Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"and early seventeenth centuries.12A good example is John Dove’s1605treatiseA Confutation of Atheisme,13which approvingly quotes bookvofLucretius in support of his argument that“the worlde shall haue an end.”14Despite the ritual condemnation of Lucretius in early modern England, thisreveals an important strain within continental humanism, one not com-pletely overwritten by Protestantism. Beginning with Petrarch, a number ofhumanists argued that if they could not exactly reconcile Epicurean andChristian ethics, then they might at least bring them into conversation withone another.15Most of these writers were much less inclined than EnglishProtestants to use Christian doctrine as a stick with which to beat Epicureanthinkers like Lucretius. Although this approach did not achieve its fullexpression until the work of men like Pierre Gassendi in the middle ofthe seventeenth century, it can be seen in embryo in a small number ofearlier writers such as Michel de Montaigne.16Commonly scholars see Montaigne as one of the foremost conduitsthrough which skepticism enters the mainstream of early modern intellec-tual culture.17And, of course, Shakespeare’s interest in and use ofMontaigne’s work is well known. Less often noted is his extensive engage-ment withDe Rerum Naturathroughout his essays and especially in hisApologie of Raymond Sebond. Shakespeare could have picked up a decentworking knowledge of Lucretius from John Florio’s1603translation ofMontaigne’s works, published a year beforeMeasure for Measure.18Indeed, it is worth noting that while there is no surviving early modernEnglish translation ofDe Rerum Naturauntil Lucy Hutchinson’s in the midseventeenth century, Florio’s Montaigne offers a serviceable“edited high-lights”of the poem for interested readers. And it is interesting that as aFrench Catholic, Montaigne quotes a number of passages which, in anEnglish Protestant context, would have been used to condemn the poet, co-opting Lucretius in defense of Montaigne’s own skeptical reading of naturaltheology. For example, he quotes the poem on man’s tendency to12Hamlin,Tragedy and Scepticism,p.56.13See John Dove,A confutation of atheisme...(London: Edward Allde,1605), p.2and p.27.14Ibid., p.94.

If Montaigneisattracted to Lucretian skepticism concerningreligion, then it is surely in the broader context of developing his claim thatbecause our perceptual faculties are invariably“full of weaknes and false-hood”–to use a phrase of John Calvin’s–and since humanity is incapableof reaching the divine, the political abuse of religion is misplaced andtragically futile.20True Christian knowledge is revealed knowledge.Even though they stood on either side of the major early moderntheological divide, Montaigne and Calvin would have both agreed that allhuman knowledge is revealed yet imperfect. Where the two thinkers departfrom each other isfirst in their approach to natural law–Calvin is by far themore systematic thinker–and secondly in the conclusions that Calvinargues follow from his account of natural law, specifically in its consequen-ces for humanity. Calvin’s is a resolutely unspeculative, even skeptical,theology. As he says, those who ask“What is God?”are“merely toyingwith idle speculations.”Knowledge of the divine cannot be founded uponspeculative reasoning. When it comes to comprehending God it isfirstnecessary to reframe our terms of reference:It is more important for us to know of what sort he is and what is consistentwith his nature. What good is it to profess with Epicurus some sort of Godwho has cast aside the care of the world only to amuse himself in idleness?What help is it, in short, to know a God with whom we have nothing to do?The possibility of knowing the divine is refashioned here as a philosophicalproposition, one rooted in an epistemology where what humans know ofGod does not equate ontologically to what he actually is.“God”is a beingwhose existence is refracted in certain worldly, observable phenomena andhuman perceptions. If humans do know God then it is not in himself butanalogously, through those mimetic secondary things that are“consistent19Michel de Montaigne,An Apologie of Raymond Sebond,inThe Essayes of Michael Lord of MontaigneTranslated by John Florio, ed. Henry Morley (London: George Routledge & Sons,1886), p.252.20Ibid., p.306.136Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"with his nature.”21Yet the secondary nature of these phenomena is not to bedismissed lightly. They are signs of God’s providential control over his creation,and the fact of their existence helps to refute the Epicurean charge that thedivine is indifferent to human affairs. For Calvin, natural law is synonymouswith, and emblematic of, God’swill.22This connection would not be possibleunless“men’s minds had not already been imbued with afirm conviction aboutGod, from which the inclination towards religion springs as from a seed.”23Nevertheless, the problem is that humans are all too apt to mistake thesesecondary mimetic reflections, whether in nature or in their own perceptualfaculties, for God himself, and to falsely assume that the law governing earthand heaven is essentially contiguous. Humans have been given laws to liveby, as codified in the Commandments, because“man is so shrouded in thedarkness of errors that he hardly begins to grasp through this natural lawwhat worship is acceptable to God...the Lord has provided us with awritten law to give us a clearer witness of what was too obscure in the naturallaw.”24Natural law is operative in humans, but it is dangerous to over-emphasize its efficacy in a postlapsarian world. Indeed, Calvin goes so far asto argue, in one of his very few positive presentations of the issue, that“idolatry is ample proof of this conception.”As he notes, humans wouldprefer“to worship wood and stone rather than to be thought of as having noGod.”25The very fact that such an implacable opponent of idolatry shouldco-opt a practice prohibited by the Decalogue in order to argue that religionis thesine qua nonof all human existence demonstrates the extent to whichCalvin’s articulation of natural law is essentially a defensive, skeptical one.26Although knowledge of God is possible, the corruption of humanity afterthe Fall is so severe that very few have access to that knowledge. This is thepoint at which Calvin’s Protestantism and Montaigne’s Catholicism partcompany.27Idolatry proves for Calvin that laws are necessary in order to21John Calvin,Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles(London: SCM Press,1961),i.ii.2(p.41).22In my discussion of Calvin on natural law, I have found the following studies helpful:François Wendel,Calvin(London: Collins,1973), pp.150–65; R. S. White,Natural Law in EnglishRenaissance Literature(Cambridge University Press,1996), esp. pp.36–43; J. B.

S. White is certainly correct that Calvin“did not deny at least the potential for reason andconscience within people”when encountering natural law. But his conclusion that“the more positiveaspects of his theology show that he believed depravity could be overcome”is too optimistic a readingof Calvin’s thought (Natural Law,p.40).27Too often, critics allow Montaigne’s commitment to philosophical skepticism to obscure the equallyimportant fact of his Catholicism.Lucretius, Calvin, and natural law inMeasure for Measure137"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"structure human society and to tame the wilder instincts of humanity. Thedifficulty, as J. B. Schneewind succinctly puts it, is that in the fallen world“We know what we ought to do but we do not do it.”28Obeying the civillaw is necessary, and humans might accomplish this to some degree, butinvariably most will fall short. This is why the law should be rigorouslyenforced. Strict civil laws reflect the transcendent nature of divine law.Because humans have deteriorated so far from their original glory, only avery few will have true knowledge of God’s law. Cruciallythisknowledge isrevealed by Scripture and through the gift of grace, which is bestowedgratuitously upon those whom God has saved: the elect. Only throughrevealed knowledge can the kingdoms of man and God, natural and civillaw, human and divine knowledge, be reconciled. And proper, unadulter-ated knowledge of God can only be attained after death and judgment: herewefind most of the central theological threads that are later emphasized inearly modern Puritanism and that are associated with Angelo inMeasure forMeasure.In making this point, Calvin returns to a suggestive metaphor that wehave already encountered:“As experience shows, God hassown a seed ofreligionin all men. But scarcely one man in a hundred is met with whofosters it, once received, in his heart, and none in whom it ripens–muchless shows fruit in season...all degenerate from the true knowledge ofhim.”29The idea of religion as a seed is, of course, biblically derived, andCalvin most likely has this source in mind. It is commonly used by Christ inthe Gospels, most notably when he rebukes his disciples for their lack ofbelief and likens faith to“a graine of mustard seede”(Matthew17:20).30Butthe metaphor is also central to discussions of physics in classical philosophy,as, for example, in Lucretius’sDe Rerum Natura.Despite his popular reputation to the contrary in the early modernperiod, Lucretius is not an atheist: he simply argues that the gods havenothing to do with creation, are indifferent to human concerns, and do notprovidentially interfere in human affairs. Lucretius departs from the skep-ticism of the more radical Pyrrhonists in generally valuing sense perception:“whatever at any time / Has seemed to the sense to be true, is true”(iv.498–9). But he also notes that the senses can deceive and that“nothingis more difficult than to distinguish / And separate plain things from28Schneewind,Invention,p.34.29Calvin,Institutes,i.iv.1(p.47, my emphasis).30All references to the Geneva Bible.The Bible, That Is, The Holy Scriptures(London: ChristopherBarker,1599). The passage also draws on Psalm1:3. The most well-known early modern exposition ofthe idea is found in William Perkins’s treatiseA graine of musterd-seed(London,1597).138Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"doubtful things”(iv.468). This view is close to what Hamlin has termedacademic skepticism: although“epistemological certainty is impossible toattain,”humans should still“develop forms of probable knowledge basedon a scrupulous study of appearances.”31To reject the false“images”co-opted in the name of religion is to achieve what Florio’s translation calls“Ataraxie”:“the condition of a quiet and settled life, exempted from theagitations which we receive by the impression of the opinion and knowledgewe imagine to have of things.”32This is partly due to Lucretius’s atomisticconception of existence and partly because of his ethical desire to releasehumans from what he calls the“terror of the priests”(i.103). For Lucretius,creationex nihilois impossible since“each thing is created / Fromfixedspecific seeds.”These seeds are themselves made up of the“primal atoms”that constitute all matter in the universe (i.167–70).33In fact, the onlythings that exist in the universe are atoms and the void within which theymove, or rather swerve. As Lucretius explains, although atoms move down-wards through the void, at certain times“they swerve slightly from theircourse”(ii.219). This“swerve”is what causes things to be created and is also“the origin of this free will / Possessed by living creatures”(ii.256–7). Goddoes not enable free will: the random motion of atoms does, a“swerve”thathas no predetermined ethical purpose. The linear or teleological conceptionof time, found in Aristotle’sPhysicsand later taken up by Christian theo-logians, is challenged by Lucretius’s poem.Lucretius is attacked with such vehemence by Calvin–and, as we haveseen, by many of Calvin’s English followers–because his providentiallyordered, predestinarian worldfinds its dialectical counterpart inDe RerumNatura. For Calvin, any kind of motion, whether expressed as free will,perception, or knowledge, is only valid because it points to a revealed truthbeyondthis world. For Lucretius, any kind of motion, initiated in the atomic“swerve”and expressed as free will, is simply a fact of material existence, onethat has no providential meaning. No matter how vigorously Calvin tries tooppose this view, it continues to haunt his understanding of natural law. AsShakespeare shows inMeasure for Measure, the Christian“graine of mustardseede”is always potentially in danger of morphing into the Lucretianatomistic seed.31Hamlin,Tragedy and Scepticism,p.3.32Montaigne,Apologie, pp.254–5. Montaigne frequently raises this possibility in his quotations fromLucretius, even if he stops short of personally endorsing it.33All references are to Melville’s translation.Lucretius, Calvin, and natural law inMeasure for Measure139"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"IIIThe opening scene of the play stages a central ethical question: is the lawsomething that is known or revealed? Shakespeare explores the issuethrough a complex interrelation of religious and political language. In hisfirst speech, the Duke interestingly declines to outline the“properties”of“government.”Unlike King James, only too happy to expound his politicaltheology at length, Vincentio simply declares that in Escalus’s case“science /Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice / My strength can give you”(1.1.1–7).34If the Duke represents the civil law, then it is a rational system based onknowledge (“science”) whose precepts have already been acquired andinternalized. He is content that the“nature of our people”is known toEscalus in his“sufficiency”(1.1.8). Nevertheless, having handed over his“commission”he also tells Escalus that it is an injunction“From which wewould not have you warp”(1.1.14). From the opening scene, then, twoconceptions of the law are at play. Thefirst sees the law as something whichis inherent to all and rationally known, and the second sees the law assomething which is prescribed and immutable. The former relates to ourepistemic access to the law, and the latter to the law’s nature and constitu-tion. Ultimately, these two conceptions may well be compatible, but theplay is striking for the way in which it explores how this compatibility mightbe attained. Whatever else he does, the Duke is wary ofhiscommissionwarping or swerving: man may know the law but it still needs to beenforced. He says of the puritanical Angelo that he has“Elected him ourabsence to supply; / Lent him our terror, drest him with our love, / Andgiven his deputation all the organs / Of our own power”(1.1.18–21).Undoubtedly the primary meaning of“elected”here is political. Yet inearly modern English the word invariably also carries overtones of religiouselection, the state of being one of the saved or elect.35The Duke’s use of theterm is wryly ironic and plays on this dual meaning: a secular ruler canmimetically elect a deputy in his stead, but only God may“elect.”The fact that Angelo’s election, and the“terror”that it lends him, istemporary is crucial. One of the hottest topics within early modernCalvinism was whether or not it was possible to know the state of one’selection. In his discussions of this issue, William Perkins argues thatassurance is extended not only to the elect but also to the reprobate, whoenjoy what he calls temporary faith, an extremely powerful force that makes34All references are to William Shakespeare,Measure for Measure, ed. J. W. Lever (London: Routledge,1994).35See Gless,Law and the Convent, pp.22–40.140Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"them“dreame that they are Kings, when they are very beggars.”36Perkinslikens faith to the imprint of a seal on wax. He writes that“we may beholdein our selues some sure representations of all these imprinted, and euenstamped in vs by the worde,”and a little later that“by the similitude of theforme of a seale fashioned in waxe, we do easily vnderstand what is the veryforme and fashion of the seale.”In this“the manner of god by the effects ofhis election and predestination [is] imprinted in vs.”37The difficulty lies inverifying the sufficiency of the seal on the wax. How can anyone tell thedifference between justifying and temporary faith?Significantly, the opening scene ofMeasure for Measurealso utilizes themetaphor of the seal. Before Angelo appears, the Duke asks Escalus“Whatfigure of us, think you, he will bear?,”a question that draws upon themetaphor of the“ducal stamp on the seal of the commission.”38It alsoimplies that in mimetic terms Angelo may fashion himself in any number ofguises before the Duke’s authority. From the start, Angelo is wary of thecommission, perhaps revealing a puritanical ambivalence towards the sub-stitutory nature of the authority that he is taking on. His political election asmimetic substitute does not necessarily imply his divine election by God.He must“enforce or qualify the laws / As to your soul seems good”(1.1.65–6). Angelo is represented as a simulacrum, a seal upon the wax, aman whose virtue might be“good”but which may just as easily prove to becounterfeit. His position as“elected”substitute implies that the divine law isalways opaque, impartially known, even to its adherents: all we have are“figures”that imperfectly reflect that law. It also suggests that the one whopropagates the law may also be condemned by it.Once Angelo assumes control, it quickly becomes apparent that his ruleis governed by a strict Protestant interpretation of the law, one thatpromulgates“a harshly penal enforcement of virtue.”39When MistressOverdone realizes that“all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulleddown,”she comments,“Why, here’s a change indeed in the common-wealth!”(1.2.93–6). Pleasure, especially sexual pleasure, is to be rigorouslypoliced in Angelo’s reformed state. But hypocrisy, greed, and class enmityare at work here too. While all the brothels in the suburbs are condemned,those inside the city walls, says Pompey,“shall stand for seed: they had36William Perkins,A Case of Conscience, the greatest that euer was...(London: John Legat,1595), sig.D4v.

Thevocabulary here is comically ironic. As Lucretius notes, nature“neverreduces anything to nothing...since all things are composed / Of ever-lasting seeds”(i.217–22). Just like the forces of nature, then, sexuality cannever be completely tamed. Hypocrisy and greed may determine sexualethics: but neither of these forces is as powerful as sexual desire.The religious underpinnings of Angelo’s new dispensation are wrylyalluded to in Lucio’s banter with the First Gentleman:“Grace is grace,despite all controversy; as for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain,despite of all grace”(1.2.24–6).40Given Lucio’s subversive choric rolethroughout the play, we need hardly assume that this is whathethinksabout grace. But it is notable that his construction of the doctrine isinformed by Romans11:6and by the logic of predestinarian Calvinism:just as temporary faith is not the same as justification, so no amount of gracecan save the reprobate villain who has already been condemned by God. Asimilar argument is drawn upon by Claudio when he explains his arraign-ment to Lucio:Thus can the demi-god, Authority,Make us pay down for our offence by weight.The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;On whom it will not, so; yet still’tis just.(1.2.112–15)The law under which Claudio is being punished is analogous to theCalvinist doctrine of justification: it is staggeringly arbitrary yet incompre-hensibly just. But, as the scene also suggests, human sexuality threatens toexceed the limits of the law, even to destruction:“Our natures do pursue, /Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, / A thirsty evil; and when wedrink, we die”(1.2.120–2). A more positive, Lucretian gloss is given byLucio. Telling Isabella of her brother’s predicament, he says that“from theseedness the bare fallow brings / To teeming foison, even so her plenteouswomb / Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry”(1.4.42–4). Justificationexceeds the law because of God’s arbitrary and incomprehensible decree.According to the logic of Angelo’s laws, sexuality is similarly arbitrary,incomprehensible, and accidental. But can a strict law prohibiting sexualexcess properly function in a world determined by the atomistic seed, onethat expresses itself with such“teeming foison”? If his sexual drives position40See Romans11:6:“And ifit beof grace, it is no more of workes: or els were grace no more grace: but ifit be of works, it is no more grace: or els were worke no more worke.”142Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Claudio as analogous to a reprobate then, by extension, the rest of humanitymust be similarly condemned.This scene points up a key ethical contradiction that operates in Angelo’sstate. In the case of the wise burgher, sex affords him a chance to turn aprofit: in Claudio’s case, sex positions him as a reprobate whose drives andappetites need to be curbed. Lucio says that Angelo represses his naturalinstincts in favour of“mind, study and fast.”He claims he is“one who neverfeels / The wanton stings and motions of the sense”(1.4.58–61). Yet asLucretius points out, in an atomic universe, motion and sense are, like“wanton”sex, inescapable facts of material existence: atoms are“tossedperpetually / In endless motion through the mighty void,”producingmatter (2.122–3). Similar to Shakespeare in this play, Lucretius sees human-ity’s inability to order their sexual impulses as inherently comic. Thesuburbs of Vienna are populated by people whose“hollow”(1.2.52) bonesstand, like the Lucretian void, as a bodily comment on their swerving/swiving. Claudio and Lucio may be right that the deputy’s attempt toregulate sexuality is a form of“tyranny”(1.2.152) and“fear”(1.4.62), butat this stage in the drama, those on the wrong side of the city walls do nothave the luxury of contesting the ethical standards by which they are to bejudged.41In Act2Shakespeare continues his exploration of natural law in theextraordinary scenes between Angelo and Isabella. Throughout their spar-ring, the relationship between the law and sexuality as opposing forces isparticularly acute. Isabella asks Angelo to punish her brother’s crime, nother brother. Angelo’s central principle throughout is based on an impla-cably puritanical predestinarian logic:“Condemn the fault, and not theactor of it? / Why, every fault’s condemned ere it be done”(2.2.38). Hemaintains that his will is merely the conduit through which the lawoperates, arguing that“It is the law, not I, condemn your brother”(2.2.80). Isabella calls this a“just but severe law”(2.2.41) and is onlypersuaded to pursue her suit by Lucio’s exhortations.Interestingly, most of Lucio’s interjections in this scene pertain tomotion. He frequently accuses Isabella of being too cold, that is to saynot active or masculine enough, and tells her to“touch”Angelo, to speakfurther, to say more and to go“to him”: after one of her pleas he says that41It is worth noting that this scene, and some others in the play, may well have been written by ThomasMiddleton. See the introduction to John Jowett’s edition ofMeasure for MeasureinThomasMiddleton: The Collected Works, ed. Gary Taylor and John Lavignino (Oxford: Clarendon Press,2007), pp.1542–6.

Just asLucretius says that“Touch is the body’s sense”(2.435), so Lucio is theLucretianmalin genie, one whose tactile interjections provoke the motionthat enables Isabella to challenge Angelo’s teleological, deterministic logic.42She asks that he extend“mercy,”which“will breathe within your lips, / Likeman new made”(2.2.78–9). This is an image of Paulinerenovatiowhere the“old man”of sin is destroyed in Christ, where grace is made possible, andwhere“death hath no more dominion”(Romans6:6). She also asks,“Whois it that hath died for this offence? / There’s many that have committed it”(2.2.89–90), an argument that we saw advanced in Act1, and that Luciopredictably approves of. But Angelo is unmoved and emphasizes death as aliteral, Mosaic sanction:The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:Those many had not dar’d to do that evilIf thefirst that did th’edict infringeHad answer’d for his deed. Now’tis awake,Takes note of what is done, and like a prophetLooks in a glass that shows what future evils,Either new, or by remissness new conceiv’d,And so in progress to be hatch’d and born,Are now to have no successive degrees,But ere they live, to end.(2.2.91–100)The text invoked here ischapter7of Romans where Paul writes of theshift from the Old Mosaic Law to the New Law of Christ:“ye also arebecome dead to the law by the body of Christ...now we are deliveredfrom the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should servein newness of spirit, and notinthe oldness of the letter”(Romans7:4–6).With his absolute adherence to death as the punishment for fornication,Angelo reinscribes a literal, Mosaicreading of the law that denies mercyand grace. In his commentary on this passage, Calvin warns explicitlyagainst doing just this:“Paul shows by contrast still more clearly howwrong the zealots of the law are to keep believers under its power. As longas the literal teaching of the law rules and is in force without connexionwith the Spirit of Christ, the lust of theflesh is not restrained but rather42Lucio’s name is often read by critics as recalling“Lucifer, the fallen angel of light and mocking fatherof lies”(Marx,Shakespeare and the Bible,p.79). But does the name perhaps have other overtones?ThroughoutDe Rerum Natura, religion is presented as irredeemably dark: freedom from its tyranny islikened to shining a“clear light”(1.144). Might this not help contextualise Lucio’s subversive, choricrole throughout the play?144Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"increases.”43For a biblically minded audience, this speech would havefigured Angelo as a mistaken, perhaps even willfully hypocritical misinter-preter of Scripture. Significantly, though, it is Angelo’s“sense”(2.2.169)that is touched throughout the scene. His literal interpretation of the lawopens the way to Pauline“lust of theflesh,”just as his denial of desiregradually exposes him to the snares of Lucretian sensuality.When Isabella enters in Act2, scene4, she says to Angelo that she is“come to know your pleasure.”He replies,“That you might know it, wouldmuch better please me, / Than to demand what’tis”(2.4.31–3), a commentthat ironically juxtaposes a philosophically minded“knowing”and“pleas-ure”with their morefleshly counterparts. In Angelo’s opening soliloquy, hedescribes the change that Isabella has engendered in him through variousmetaphors of sexual motion and arousal. Contrasting them with his inabil-ity to engage with“Heaven,”he speaks of“the strong and swelling evil / Ofmy conception”(2.4.6–7) and of the“blood”mustering round his“heart”(2.4.20). It is the involuntary nature of these movements that seems toperturb Angelo the most. InDe Rerum Natura, Lucretius speaks of sexualdesire in terms that contextualize the deputy’s predicament. The poet usesthe metaphor of racehorses leaving their traps in order to explain that“heartbegins the motion / Then mind and will join in and drive it on / Until itreaches all the body and limbs”(ii.268–70). Desire begins in the heart, isintellectualized by the mind and then manifested in the body. There is noreligious sanction for sexual desire. As Angelo complains,“Heaven hath myempty words”(2.4.2). Lucretius then explains that sexual desire makes thegenitals“swell with the seed, then comes desire / To eject it where the direcraving pulls / And the body seeks that which has wounded the mind withlove”(iv.1045–7). This conception of desire is different from the patriarchalAristotelian model that predominated in the early modern period. ForLucretius, sexual union can involve maleandfemale pleasure: both partnersare“liquefied in rapture.”44I will return to this point shortly.Here again, then, as in their previous encounter, sexual ethics arerefracted through theologically inflected debate. In the play’s openingscene the image of the seal on wax is used to denote the difficulty ofdistinguishing the righteous from the unrighteous. Throughout Angeloand Isabella’s second scene, the problem of similitude is similarly invoked43John Calvin,Calvin’s Commentaries: Romans and Thessalonians, trans.

For example,he asks:Which had you rather, that the most just lawNow took your brother’s life; or, to redeem him,Give up your body to such sweet uncleannessAs she that he hath stain’d?(2.4.52–5)Again Angelo takes a key biblical text, in this case Romans1:21–7, andmanipulates it to his own ends. For Paul, the law and the lusts of thefleshare utterly antithetical. Isabella agrees:“I had rather give my body than mysoul”(2.4.56). Paul writes of those who ignore or corrupt the law and“turnthe glorie of the incorruptible God to the similitude of the image of acorruptible man.”As punishment,“God gaue them vp to their hearts lusts,vnto vncleanesse, to defile their owne bodies betweene themselues...themen left the naturall vse of the women, and burned in their lust one towardanother...God deliuered them vp vnto a reprobate minde.”In his falsealignment of the law and sex, Angelo evokes this Pauline nightmare ofreprobate, mimetic sexual“uncleanness.”Isabella attempts to reclaim a sense of Pauline rectitude:“lawful mercy /Is nothing kin to foul redemption”(2.4.112–13). Angelo responds by con-structing her refusal as a kind of false mimesis. He says that her“sensepursues not mine”and claims that“either you are ignorant, / Or seem so,crafty”(2.2.74–5). Isabella rejects this mimetic slur, stating that women are“credulous to false prints”(2.4.129) and that Angelo’s honor and purpose arein fact nothing more than“Seeming, seeming!”(2.4.149). The problem,already outlined in Perkins’s discussion of justification, is in distinguishing“seeming”from truth. As Calvin notes in his commentary on Romans1,“Ungodliness is a hidden evil,”or as Angelo puts it to Isabella,“my falseo’erweighs your true”(2.4.169).45Moreover, as Lucretius explains, desireoperates in an analogous, mimetic fashion:“from a pretty face or rosycheeks / Nothing comes into the body to enjoy / But images, thinimages.../ So in loveVenus mocks lovers with images”(iv.1095–101,myemphasis). When it comes to sexual desire, humans are impelled into aworld of mimetic signs: in such a world, pleasure and pain are never far fromeach other. In a sense, the Pauline reprobate and the Lucretian subject aresimilarlyfigured as in thrall to drives that are accidental and irresistible: theformer sees this as tragic, the latter as inherently comic, a fact that may inpart account for the bittersweet generic makeup of this play. The difficult45Calvin,Commentaries,p.34.146Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"question raised by Shakespeare in these scenes is whether or not such sexualdrives can coexist with a religiously determined requirement to behave in anethically acceptable manner.Angelo states that“now I give my sensual race the rein”(2.4.159), a linethat also draws upon equine imagery. It may also have reminded some in theaudience of James3:1–10. Interestingly, whereas Lucretius uses equineimagery to explain the movement of desire, James uses similar imagery tosuggest that desire should be curtailed. The text speaks about the man whodoes not sin as one“able to bridle all the body...Behold, wee put bittesinto the horses mouthes, that they should obey vs,”and notes just howdifficult it is for man to“bridle”his appetites (James3:2–3). Counterfeitinghimself as a godly, disinterested arbiter of the law who proclaims, like Godin Genesis, that sexual malefactors shall“die the death”(2.4.164; Genesis2:17), Angelo in2.4continues to emerge as a Lucretian sensualist in thrall tohis sexual desires.46In fact, the scene turns on the keen tension between aChristian and a materialist understanding of sex.Angelo’s command that Isabella“Lay by all nicety and prolixiousblushes / That banish what they sue for”(2.4.161–2) is based on a patri-archally conceived Christian misogyny. Lucretius writes in an analogousvein about the“glances,”the“snares of love”(iv.1139;1146), and the“pains”that women take for“those they wish to hold in chains of love”(i.1187). Thecrucial difference is that, unlike Angelo’s Christian-inspired rhetoric,Lucretius also recognizes the potential for equality in sexual relations:“Not always is a woman feigning love / When she sighs and clings to aman in close embrace.”Indeed, when it comes to sex“the pleasure ismutual”(4.1191–2;1207). It is significant that Claudio describes his sexualrelationship with Juliet as“our most mutual entertainment”(1.2.143). Theterm is also used in the scene between the Duke and Juliet where she agreesthat their“offenceful act”was“mutually committed”(2.3.27). Whether ornot mutuality offers an adequate basis for sexual ethics is a moot point. Butwhereas the Duke enjoins repentance for this sexual mutuality (2.3.30),Angelo offers sexual coercion and death. He wants pleasure for himself atthe same time as he denies the broader social and ethical utility of pleasure.His hypocrisy is explored by Isabella in her closing soliloquy:O perilous mouths,That bear in them one and the self-same tongueEither of condemnation or approof,46The note to this verse in the Geneva Bible says that this moment represents“the separation of manfrom God.”Lucretius, Calvin, and natural law inMeasure for Measure147"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Bidding the law make curtsey to their will,Hooking both right and wrong to th’appetite,To follow as it draws!(2.4.171–6)The language here is redolent of the Bible and of Lucretian atomism. Again,James3is the biblical source text. By way of explaining just how difficult it isfor man to curb his desires, James develops the metaphor of the tongue assomething that“can no man tame.It isan vnrully euill, full of deadlypoison.”We should“blesse God”and“curse men”because the latter are“made in the similitude of God. Out of one mouth proceedeth blessing andcursing; my brethren, these things ought not so to be”(James2:8–10). Thepoint is clear: Angelo is a hypocritical“similitude”whose law condemnsothers as it approves his own“perilous”sexual will.47But even more fascinating than this is Isabella’s conceit that Angelo’s actionsare“Hooking both right and wrong to th’appetite, / To follow as it draws!”This is the only place in his writings that Shakespeare uses the verb“hooking.”Obviously it draws upon the metaphor offishing. However, in bookiiofDeRerum Natura,Lucretiusoffers an atomistic explanation as to why things aredifferent shapes and how this affects our sense perceptions of them:So you can easily see that smooth round atomsMake up things which give pleasure to our senses,But, by contrast, things that seem harsh and bitterAre more composed of atoms that are hooked [hamatis],Which therefore tear their way into our senses,And entering break the surface of our bodies.(II.402–7)Angelo’s will is like the hooked Lucretian atom, breaking its way intoIsabella’s“soft”(2.4.128) body. In this way, his command–“Fit thy consentto my sharp appetite”(2.4.160)–can also be seen as an attempt to force his“harsh”(from the Latinasper)“appetite”on to an opponent whose onlydefense is Christian“chastity”(2.4.184).Isabella notes that her brother has similarly fallen“by prompture of theblood,”but that he hassuch a mind of honour,That had he twenty heads to tender downOr twenty bloody blocks, he’d yield them upBefore his sister should her body stoopTo such abhorr’d pollution.(2.4.177–82)47TheOEDquotes this line from the play in its second definition of“aproof”as“sanction, approval,approbation.”148Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"This section of Isabella’s speech makes the shocking connection betweenexecution and sex, both of which involve a stooping or bending over. Instating that her brother would sooner bend to the block than allow her to“stoop”to Angelo, I think that this passage may well draw indirectly onwhat was, in the early modern period, the most controversial passage inLucretius’s poem. Describing the best way for a woman to conceive, and inkeeping with his view that sex involves mutual pleasure, Lucretius writes:What matters most of all is the positionIn which the soothing pleasure itself is taken;For in the manner of four-footed beasts,It is generally thought that women best conceive,Breast down and loins uplifted, so the seedsCan take more easily their proper places.However, he goes on to note:Wives have no need at all of wanton movements.For a woman avoids conception andfights against it,If in delight she holds his penis closeBetween her buttocks, and all her body limp,Flows with the waves and sways with every tide.She turns the furrow from its rightful courseUnder the ploughshare, makes the seed fall wide.Whores do this for their private purposesLest they befilled too often and lie pregnant,And to make their loves more pleasing to their men.(iv.1262–76)As Isabella says in act3, her“bending down”(3.1.143) for Angelo would bebad enough. But if she were to avoid becoming pregnant then she wouldneed to behave as Lucretius says prostitutes do in order to expel the“abhord’d pollution”of Angelo’s seed. Claudio’s death is therefore pref-erable to the sexual death that Isabella’s Christian vows demand she for-swears. Via the clash of Lucretian and Christian imagery and language inthese scenes, Shakespeare shows how the potential ethical utility ofLucretian pleasure and mutuality is compromised on the one hand byAngelo’s puritanical hypocrisy and on the other by Isabella’s Catholicdisavowal of human sexuality. He doesn’t seek to excuse Angelo’s actionsnor Isabella’s willingness to condemn her brother. Rather, it is the perver-sion or repression of“simple pleasures”(ii.22) which causes personal andpolitical strife.As I noted earlier, Lucio is the most Lucretianfigure in the play. Heclaims that Angelo is incapable of sex, calling him in language redolent withLucretius, Calvin, and natural law inMeasure for Measure149"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Lucretian materialism, a“motion ungenerative”(3.2.108) and an“ungeni-tured agent”who will“unpeople the province with continency”(3.2.167–9).Significantly, he also says that the Duke is well known in Vienna for hissexual activity. The Duke denies this, saying he“was not much detected forwomen; he was not inclined that way”(3.2.118–19). While this may be ametatheatrical dig at James I’s own sexual preferences, it surely also goes tothe heart of the Duke’s dilemma: in order to reclaim sexuality from thecondemnation of the hypocritical Puritan, he needs to restate his own sexualvirility in the public sphere. Lucio inadvertently brings this issue to the fore;and while in most respects he stands as the complete antithesis to Angelo,what does unite them is their shared sexual hypocrisy. Lucio has made awoman pregnant but has denied it in order to avoid marrying her. Inadmitting this to the Duke he concludes by saying,“I am a kind of burr,I shall stick”(4.3.177). The metaphor is well chosen: similar to a hookedatom, a burr hooks on to a host in order to disseminate its seed as widely aspossible. The burr is also an accidental parasite, dependent upon a host whois unaware of its presence. But it is perhaps the Duke who gives the gameaway best in Act4. When Claudio’s look-alike, the pirate Ragozine, dies,the Duke has no compunction in commanding his head to be sent toAngelo, commenting on the substitution:“O,’tis an accident that heavenprovides”(4.3.76). In this claim, resourcefulness and hypocrisy sit side byside: in a world where the civil law is contingent upon the divine, the Dukecannot be seen to valorize the accidental simply on its own terms. If he is toreturn to Vienna, he will need to reclaim in some way the political utility ofaccidentals within a religious framework.The Duke’s phrase therefore nicely crystallizes the central politicaldilemma of the play. Whether in the relationship between the hypocriticalAngelo and the absolute Isabella, in the comedic subplot, or in a Dukewhose sexual interests may be unconventional, no amount of religiousmorality will stop humans from spilling their seed, sexually or volitionally,in places they shouldn’t. Viewed as a drive over which humans have alimited amount of control, sex can be seen as the ultimate expression of anatomic universe. As the witty Lucio suggests, a Lucretian universe wheresexual pleasure and mutuality are valued is largely preferable to one that triesto control or deny human sexuality. However, the image of Lucio as a“burr”and of Angelo’s hooked will also points up the potential for parasitesand hypocrites toflourish in such a society, one that decouples the claims ofsexual pleasure from the equally important claims of ethical responsibility.To see sex as an uncontrollable drive is, as the play notes in various places, arapist’s charter. So can a materialistic understanding of sexuality as accident150Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"coexist with a more deterministic religious ethics that seeks to regulate andprotect humans from the worst excesses of that sexual imperative?Lots of critics ofMeasure for Measureget somewhat over-excited by thePauline turn that the play takes, especially in the last act, claiming for examplethat the Duke and Isabella are Christ-likefigures. In the universe ofMeasure forMeasure, where Calvin and Lucretius strive for precedence, I think this is aninterpretative step too far. The point is surely the imperfect, mimetic, andfleshlynature of theDuke’s and Isabella’s plot: it turns on a comical redaction ofPauline and Lucretian mimesis where accidentals are manipulated in order torefashion the law. As Lucretius points out in booki,“nature works by means ofhidden bodies”(i.329), a statement that could stand as epigraph for themachinations ofMeasure for Measure. Such a reading is not necessarily incom-patible with Christian ethics either. As the Pauline epistles insistently pointout, thefleshly types of this world offer an eschatological prefiguration of theworld to come. This is what Giorgio Agamben, following Walter Benjamin,has called“messianic time.”This period represents not a future time ofperfection but rather instantiates a“summary recapitulation of the past”which saturates or fulfils the“time of the now”in“anticipationof eschato-logical fulfilment.”48The key word here is“anticipation.”Both Pauline“Messianic time”and Lucretian“fluid time”49do not offer us the thing itself:under each dispensation, thefigure and the image is all. Paradoxically, thepromise of this time to come may also offer a useful basis for law.Thefinal act of the play begins with the sound of trumpets as the Dukeenters the gates of the city in triumph. Mariana and the Duke are unveiled,literally brought face to face (5.1.170–1;204;352) with their nemeses in amanner that recalls the Pauline promise of1Corinthians13:12. The playthen concludes with a series of marriages. All of this may recall, as numerouscritics have argued, the patterning of the eschatological promise laid out inthe New Testament, especially the Pauline epistles, and the book ofRevelation which ends with the divine comedy of Christ’s mystical marriageto the church. Modern critics are more likely than an earlier generation ofcommentators to treat such theological patterns with skepticism, and anumber have pointed out the resolutely“fleshly”aspects of the last act asa way of critiquing the play’s engagement with these patterns. In RobertWatson’s words,“The Duke’s performance of a Last Judgement at the gatesof his city, rather than the gates of heaven, is a culminating instance of the48Giorgio Agamben,The Time That Remains: A Commentary on the Letter to the Romans, trans.Patricia Dailey (Stanford University Press,2005), pp.61,76.49Jonathan Gil Harris,Untimely Matter in the Time of Shakespeare(Philadelphia: University ofPennsylvania Press,2009), p.172.Lucretius, Calvin, and natural law inMeasure for Measure151"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"wayMeasure for Measureparodies pious archetypes in asserting the priorityof earthly order and human survival.”50Certainly Isabella’s attempts toinvoke eschatology (“truth is truth / To th’end of reck’ning”;“make thetruth appear where it seems hid”[5.1.48–9;69]) fall on deaf ears. But mydifficulty with such readings is that they replicate Isabella’s credulity byassuming that there is parody at work here.Just because the close of the play is unable to invest thepresenttime withanyfinal eschatological significance, it doesn’t follow that Act5is parodyingthis discourse. This may sound like an overly literal point, but it is one thatis central to early modern political theology. The Duke’s return does notinculcate a superior“spiritual”truth in the present, one that transcends theflesh and invests the earthly ruler with divine political sanction. Vincentiois, like Angelo, also afleshly substitute. He too is subject to the radicallyantidualistic trajectory of Protestant typology. Thefinal act may imply theend time, might signal its importance throughfigures and similitudes. But itcannot instantiate the end.The unease that critics have often felt with the marriages that concludeAct5is understandable. Perhaps they stand as a wry comic reflection onMeasure for Measure’s Pauline ethics.“It is better to marrie then to burne”(1Corinthians7:9) is hardly a ringing endorsement of wedded bliss. Nor,according to a conventional Christian interpretation, is the end of Act5. Butsuch a reading only works if it ignores the Lucretian thread that I’ve beenfollowing throughout the play. The mocking, bawdy presence of Lucio inthe act is crucial here. When Mariana decorously andfiguratively says thatshe stood in Isabella’s“imagin’d person”in the garden, Lucio immediatelystresses the carnal basis of this meeting (5.1.212–13). And it is Lucio’sconstant jibes against the Duke’s sexual probity that rattle him more thananything else. Undoubtedly the Duke invokes the religious harshness of theOld Law in his condemnation of his deputy:The very mercy of the law cries outMost audible, even from his proper tongue,‘An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!’Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;Like doth quit like, and Measure for Measure.(5.1.405–9)And in sentencing Angelo to“the very block / Where Claudio stoop’dtodeath”(5.1.412–13), his words recall Isabella’s in Act2and seek to offer them50Robert N.

However, as is soon revealed, Claudio did not in fact“stoop,”and so the pattern of substitutions upon which the Duke’s threat-ened justice is based is happily shown to be false.Moreover, the Duke’sfinal speech signals an aptly imperfect assimilationof Lucretian and Christian ethics. Lucio is sent offto be whipped at theDuke’s“pleasure”(5.1.519) and ordered to marry a prostitute. If a workablepolitical order and hierarchy is to be restored, then the anarchic Lucretian“fluid time”channelled by Lucio is now redirected by the Duke in theservice of the conventional sacrament of marriage. But this is conventionwith a twist. First, sexual mutuality and pleasure is stressed:“She, Claudio,that you wrong’d, look you restore. / Joy to you, Mariana; love her, Angelo”(5.1.522–3). If we react to this, especially in the case of Angelo, by thinking“as if,”then that is, really, the whole point. In an early modern culture thatcaricatures Lucretius as a pagan sensualist, Shakespeare offers an alternativeview of sexuality based not upon these cultural clichés, but upon askingwhat society might look like if its sexual ethics were based upon theprinciple of imperfect mutuality. Consider too the Duke’s concludingwords to Isabella:Dear Isabel,I have a motion much imports your good;Whereunto if you’ll a willing ear incline,What’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.So bring us to our palace, where we’ll showWhat’s yet behind that’s meet you should all know.(5.1.531–6)The Duke certainly stresses the mutuality implicit in the wedding vows.Notice the very last word of the play, implying that there is a more perfectknowledge to be gleaned“behind,”offstage. If thefinal act is informed bythe discourses of Christian eschatology, then this sentiment has a certainlogic. The Duke’s new dispensation may be based on a“semblance”whichpapers over a fundamental lawlessness: in a society where Christianity formsthe basis of the law, that is, perhaps, inevitable. However, we might alsonotice that word“motion,”a term which combines sexual activity withLucretian atomism. Notice too that the Duke invites Isabella to“incline”her ear to this motion: as its etymology and early modern usage show,“incline”means to bend forward or downwards. Certainly, this is a differentkind of“stooping”to the one proposed by Angelo. Yet it also takes place“behind,”a knowing that is“meet”or, as Lucretius says, proper (iv.1267).So the play doesn’t end with a Calvinistic world turnedcompletelyLucretian.

Shakespeare does not formulate an unproblematic orperfect account of natural law inMeasure for Measure. But perhaps the play’smost radical challenge is to reclaim Lucretius as a deeply ethical thinker, onewhose philosophy offers a potent challenge to a dominant Calvinisticconception of natural law, and who celebrates, rather than condemns,human sexuality.154Adrian Streete"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"chapter 8Agnostic Shakespeare?: the godless worldofKing LearDavid LoewensteinJust how daring was Shakespeare in imagining–and testing–the limits ofreligious belief, order, faith, and divine powers in the widespread providen-tial culture of early modern England?

To what degree did tragic drama itself enable Shakespeareto speculate in exceptionally daring, radical, and skeptical ways aboutreligious assurances and beliefs in relation to catastrophic events? Thischapter attempts to address these questions and to do something more: toargue that Shakespeare was capable of taking great risks when it came todramatizing religious beliefs (or their absence) and daring enough to write adrama that imagines a dark, pitiless world without God or gods in an age inwhich providential thinking dominated religious culture.Determining Shakespeare’s personal religious beliefs remains elusive.2We can discern much more about Shakespeare’s major rival, Ben Jonson, in1Citations from Shakespeare’s plays are taken fromThe Norton Shakespearebased on the Oxford textand edited by Stephen Greenblatt, Walter Cohen, Jean E.

As I argue here, one of the most daringpositions Shakespeare attempted to imagine is close to what we wouldconsider agnosticism: his tragedy depicts a meaningless and hostile universewhere neither God nor gods answer multiple human appeals to supernaturalpowers, whether these appeals be for protection, divine justice, or vengeancein a world in which suffering can“top extremity”(5.3.206).5This is a radicalposition to dramatize in a providential culture in which God was usuallybelieved to be acting directly in human affairs and in which wefind religiouswriters expressing anxieties that“men [who] would make a dout of Godsprovidence”and“escape the iudgement of God”were threatening to sub-vert the religious, social, and political order.6And the play’s radicalismregarding the question of providentialism is likewise apparent when we keepin mind that James I believed that kings are“justly called Gods”whointervene actively in human affairs with the power to“make and unmake”their subjects.7I am not claiming, however, that the author ofKing Learwasto the old religion, including his imaginative grappling with Catholic practices and beliefs; Greenblattalso concisely summarizes debates about the religion of Shakespeare on pp.396–8.Jeffrey Knapp,Shakespeare’s Tribe: Church, Nation, and Theater in Renaissance England(University of Chicago Press,2002), seems more confident that we can identify Shakespeare’s religious beliefs and suggests that weunderstand his playwriting“as a kind of ministry”(p.9).3See Ian Donaldson,Ben Jonson: A Life(Oxford University Press,2011), esp. pp.138–44,255–9, and271–5on Jonson’s religious beliefs and allegiances.4[Sir John Hayward,]A Reporte of a Discourse Concerning Supreme Power in Affaires of Religion(London,1606), p.6.5Some points I make below about Shakespeare’s skeptical attitude towards providence in relation tohuman affairs are partly anticipated in William R.

And yet the play also portrays a brutal and violentworld without any kind of religious assurances. For all his remarkable capacityfor metaphysical speculation about the mysterious cosmos and for all hisefforts to negotiate the treacherous Machiavellian world of Denmark’sElsinore, Shakespeare’s Hamlet remains, at the end, a Christian prince whobelieves that“there’s a divinity that shapes our ends, / Rough-hew them howwe will”(5.2.10–11) and, echoing Matthew10:29(in the Geneva Bible), that“there’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow”(5.2.157–8).8YetKingLearis a play that seems to go to the other extreme: there Shakespeareimagines a pitiless and ruthless world without any providential meaning orsupernatural forces or religious institutions that (despite being invoked by itscharacters) shape human life, actions, and events, or help to explain inhos-pitable conditions such as the terrifying, titanic storm Lear endures, or offerconsolation in response to the harsh realities of human misery.

It has longbeen recognized that Shakespeare drew upon Harsnett’s vivid vocabulary andturn of phrase as he was writingKing Lear, especially in his depiction in Act3of Poor Tom, the feigning madman possessed by dark demonic spirits (withsuch occult names as“the foulfiend Flibbertigibbet,”Smulkin, Modo,Mahu, and Frateretto)15in an infernal, inhospitable Bosch-like landscapeand rough countryside battered by violent weather; Stephen Greenblattespecially has challenged the tendency to treat Harsnett’s richly suggestivetext as no more than a background source for the play.16My point, however,is to emphasize that there is also a difference between Shakespeare andHarsnett when it comes to the matter of providence and vengeance: for allhis emphasis on a sinister theatrical world created by cunning popish exorcistsand their“treasonable machinations”and“diabolical incantations,”the latterwriter also envisions a providential cosmos in which“He that sits in theheavens, Almighty God, with his Angels, and Saints, do laugh these mishapenmonsters to scorne.”Harsnett, who treats exorcism as a spiritual fraud,believes that ultimately“Gods revengefull arme doth uncase [theatricalexcorcists] to the view of the world.”But Shakespeare’s tragedy, while italso envisions exorcism as a spiritual fraud, offers no certainty that“Godsrevengefull arme”can be detected anywhere in human affairs, including in adark world of theatrical machinations and“impious dissimulation.”17As amad, fearful beggar vexed by invisiblefiends, Poor Tom may be the catalystthat triggers some of the banished Lear’s most seering insights about“unac-commodated man”(3.4.98–9) in an unnatural environment stripped of anyhuman comforts and disguises whatsoever.

Later the mad, raging, and suffering Lear will invoke thedestructivefires of hell, with overtones of an apocalyptic end of the world, ashe expresses hysterical disgust at monstrous female sexuality:“Beneath isall thefiends’; there’s hell, there’s darkness, / There’s the sulphurous pit,burning, scalding, / Stench, consumption! Fie,fie,fie! pah! pah!”(4.6.124–6).Harsnett has plenty of images of hell-fire,18yet in Shakespeare’s play there isno evidence at all that such terrifying torments, or Hell itself, exist to punishwicked behavior and effect retribution.Shakespeare’s experimental tragedyKing Lear, then, offers a very differentand more unsettling perspective than those contemporary texts likeHarsnett’s that suggest providential forces or agents of vengeance are atwork in the world, responding with divine indignation to the sinful, obsti-nate, and rebellious nature of humankind. If providence could be invoked toexplain terrifying natural destruction and calamities linked to human behav-ior, it could also be invoked to explain the abatement of such extremesuffering.19YetKing Learoffers no sense of any kind of providential orderto explain its harsh dramatization of human suffering. Set in pre-Christiantimes, it dramatizes no assurance of providential judgments and interventionsagainst wicked men and women and no sense of consolation in an inhos-pitable world with its“strange mutations”(4.1.11), to quote Edgar when hefirst sees his eye-less father cruelly cast out into the open country. At theheight of his powers as a tragic dramatist, Shakespeare wrote a radical playflaunting the very idea of providentialism and the belief in an interventionistdeity who responds to human misery, chaos, injustice, and savagery.In order to illuminate issues of human savagery and suffering in relationto the providential religious culture of early modern England, one can18Seechapter12ofA Declarationin Brownlow,Shakespeare, Harsnett, pp.255–7, where hell-fire isassociated with“the coales of Gods wrath and fearful indignation”(p.257).19See, e.g.,The last terrible Tempestious windes and weather(London,1613), orGods warning to his peopleof England(London,1607).160David Loewenstein"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"compare John Foxe and Shakespeare, since both writers, in their own ways,depict extremes of violence in order to examine and test issues of provi-dential order and divine justice.

Besides showing victimsabout to be beheaded or burning alive, one part of the illustration shows anaked man whoseflesh is being devoured by voracious lions; another partshows a man lying on the ground–his hands tied together and his facecontorted in agony–as his persecutor presses one foot on the victim’s chestand turns a drill that bores directly into the Christian man’s right eye.Here we may compare the brutal blinding of Gloucester inKing Lear,aterrifying episode of violence dramatized on stage and almost too painful towatch in the theater.21Cornwall tears out the“vile jelly”of Gloucester’s eyesas the latter, bound to a chair by his tormentors, appeals to the“wingèdvengeance”of the heavens (3.7.67) and asks for their help in response tosuch cruelty, while also appealing to the“Kind gods”(95) to forgive him justat that moment of anagnorisis (“O my follies!”) when he recognizes thatEdgar“was abused”(94) by the bastard Edmund.“Now, heaven help him!”cries out one servant as he observes Gloucester’s disfigured and“bleedingface”(3.7.111), closing the vicious scene on a note that raises the possibilitythat providence, or an equivalent supernatural power, might intervene onthe behalf of the miserable Gloucester. In their different mediums, bothFoxe and Shakespeare depict a spectacle of extreme cruelty meant togenerate the greatest emotional impact from readers or spectators. Foxe’sillustration of sadistic violence sets the grim tone for some of the powerfulphysical images, including those of mutilated bodies, to follow in his greatmartyrological work–a reminder of what Foxe calls, at the beginning of his20Actes and Monuments(London,1570), NN1r, after p.922; this is also thefirst illustration in the sameseries in the1583edition (see p.780).21As Janet Adelman observes, spectators in the theater are likely to close their eyes at this moment ofterrifying cruelty, thereby reduplicating Gloucester’s experience of darkness.

While this world might indeed be“ruled by mans violence andwisedome,”Foxe observes, the“happy succes of the other [was] euer ruledby Gods blessing and prouidence. The wrath & reuenging hand of God inthe one, and his mercye vpon the other.”23Shakespeare’s great tragedy alsodepicts the“violence of mens affections”and their terrifying consequences.The difference, of course, is that Shakespeare setsKing Learin a pre-Christian world–one more distant in the past (as the Fool suggests) thanthat of the legendary Merlin and King Arthur24–where, ultimately anddespite what some of the play’s characters yearn to believe, there seems to beno providential order or divine justice at all, nor evidence of God’s“wrath &reuenging hand.”This enabled Shakespeare to write an unusually daringplay in which, despite its frequent recourse to apocalyptic language, images,and overtones suggesting that the end of the world was at hand (“Is this thepromised end?”Kent wonders at the end,“Or image of that horror?”asEdgar wonders [5.3.262–3]),25no kind of religious order or assurance ofjustice operates; in this tragedy there is no evidence that divine vengeance isever executed, despite the language characters use to invoke it. Lear invokes(in a vehement exchange with Regan)“all the stored vengeances of heaven”to“fall”on Cordelia’s“ingrateful top”or head and strike her“youngbones,”while he calls upon“nimble lightnings”to“dart [their] blindingflames / Into her scornful eyes!”(2.4.155–6,158–9); Gloucester, when he isassaulted violently, believes that he“shall see”divine or“winged vengeanceovertake”the brutal daughters of Lear (3.7.66–7). Even Albany, moved bythe savagery meted out to Gloucester, can invoke“justicers”above who“speedily can venge”(4.2.79–81) when he hears that the cruel Duke ofCornwall has been slain by a servant.

Moreover, neitherFortune nor the gods can offer any consolation in the face of terrifyinghuman anguish and violence, as Lear endures an ordeal of acute torment“upon the rack of this tough world”(5.3.313) or as Gloucester hopes that thegods will offer some help in response to the dreadful cruelty he endures.Does this make Shakespeare, in this dark tragedy, an agnostic, a writerwho believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence andnature of God? Not necessarily. But it does mean that tragic drama enabledShakespeare, a writer who was likely less doctrinaire in religion than theProtestant martyrologist Foxe,to imaginea world stripped of any kind ofreligious (as well as political) assurance, a world of intense and protractedsuffering in which there is no ultimate role for providence as a force ofjustice, vengeance, or consolation in human affairs. And it does allowShakespeare to represent dramatically a disturbing strain of religious skep-ticism.27Shakespeare’s personal religious beliefs may remain elusive and thesubject of speculation; nevertheless, it is unlikely that he could have writtenthe devastating tragedy ofKing Learhad he been a fervent early modernprovidentialist like John Foxe.

At his most despairing moment, after he has been blinded andthrust out into the open country, Gloucester offers his bleakest doctrine:“Asflies to wanton boys are we to the gods; / They kill us for their sport”(4.1.37–8). Yet this vision of the gods as callous and cruel is but oneperspective and hardly a consistent one; elsewhere Gloucester can refer tothe gods as“kind”or“ever-gentle”(3.7.35,4.6.212), including at themoment of dramatic recognition when he suddenly understands that hiselder son Edgar has been abused by the cunning, self-made Edmund:“Kindgods, forgive me that, and prosper him!”(3.7.95). As the despairingGloucester faces“th’extreme verge”of Dover cliff, in a scene emblematicof the extremity of suffering, and expects to plunge to his death, he appealsto the heavens:“O you mighty gods! / This world I do renounce, and, inyour sights, / Shake patiently my great affliction off”(4.6.34–6). Yet thegods never answer Gloucester. When Edgar speaks with Gloucester of hismiraculous survival, after his apparent precipitous fall from Dover cliff,Edgar imagines that“the clearest gods”have“preserved”his“happy father”(4.6.72–4). Yet this is no more than a religiousfiction, created by Edgar outof a sense offilial compassion and loyalty.Lear too frequently appeals to the gods as though they might temper hisbehavior or bring about some kind of justice: for example, as a grieving,vulnerable old man stripped of his authority and meditating on the meaningof“true need,”he appeals to the“heavens”and“gods”to give him patience,an appeal that carries both Job-like and Christian overtones (2.4.265–8; seeRomans5.3–4);33in the midst of the terrifying storm with its“bursts ofhorrid thunder,”he refers to“the great gods”as though they and the stormitself (which assumes moral meaning in Lear’s speech) might enact divine,apocalyptic wrath and justice on crimes yet unpunished (3.2.44,47–58); orhe refers to the heavens as“just”in his searing speech about poverty andsocial justice (3.4.29–37). Yet as usual the gods or heavens never answer hisappeals nor intervene, so that readers or spectators of the play receive noassurance that they exist or (if they do) respond to human suffering,including Lear’s Job-like affliction (“a man / More sinned against thansinning”[3.2.57–8]). In this way, Shakespeare constantly prompts readers or33OnKing Lear’sassociation with the Book of Job, see Steven Marx,Shakespeare and the Bible(OxfordUniversity Press,2000), pp.59–78; Hamlin,Bible in Shakespeare,ch.8.166David Loewenstein"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"viewers to question the limits of religious belief, including the role ofsupernatural powers in human life at moments of extreme calamity andcrisis.The loyal Kent, too, seems to have faith in the gods as protective deities.He appeals to the gods to protect Cordelia spurned by Lear (“The gods totheir dear shelter take thee, maid”[1.1.183]), and in the mock trial scene heasks“the gods”to“reward”Gloucester’s“kindness”(3.6.5). Yet appeals tothe gods can be manipulated and put to darker purposes. The anarchicEdmund appeals to the“gods”to“stand up for bastards!”(1.2.22): hecynicallyflaunts the appeal to gods as protective deities in his world ofMachiavellian self-invention–a world turned upside down and designed toserve his self-interests and cunning pursuit of power. Likewise, he refers tothe“revenging gods”(2.1.46) as he engages in theatrical machinations aimedat convincing the easily duped and superstitious Gloucester that Edgar is avillain. Such references to the gods show that human invocations of super-natural deities can serve different and conflicting purposes, without everconfirming that supernatural deities truly intervene in human affairs.In the last act of the play there seem to be more hopeful appeals to thegods, although these too can be seen as projections of the fragile humanimagination responding to conditions of extremity and affliction. WhenLear and Cordelia are prisoners, Lear imagines“the gods”throwing“incense”upon them as“sacrifices”(5.3.20–1); and just before this heenvisions a happy ending that includes a fantasy in which he and his lovingdaughter might understand the mysterious workings of the world and itsiniquities (see2Thessalonians2:7) so that they“take upon’s the mystery ofthings, / As if we were God’s spies”(5.3.16–17), a passage that also leavesambiguous whether Lear is referring to multiple pagan gods or to a singleChristian one (in a play that nowhere else refers to the latter).34When Edgarfinally defeats Edmund, he proclaims his true identity (“My name is Edgar,and thy father’s son”) and moralizes at this moment of triumph:“The godsare just, and of our pleasant vices / Make instruments to plague us”(5.3.169–70).

In early modern England, eclipses, for instance, were perceived as“providential tokens of future misfortune”and momentous events, includ-ing the subversion of kingdoms.35Gloucester envisions“late eclipses,”signsof disorder in the cosmos, as signs of treasonous disorder in both thekingdom and the family, interpreting these cosmic events in an apocalypticvein that evokes the terrifying mood of the play (1.2.96–106). Yet the cynicalEdmund, who sees his father’s notions as mere superstitious“foppery,”qualifies Gloucester’s apocalyptic interpretation and its potentially provi-dential implications. He mocks astrological explanations (“an enforcedobedience of planetary influence”and movements)–explanations whichwere often in competition with providential interpretations in early modernEngland36–and insists that“our disasters”are of our making and not to beexplained“by a divine thrusting on”(1.2.109–16). Such clashing perspec-tives as these, voiced by Gloucester and Edmund, enable Shakespeare’s playto provoke skeptical and unresolved questions about supernatural powersand celestial phenomena in relation to human calamities.Appeals to the capricious Dame Fortune remind us that the play makesuse of an ideological eclecticism when it comes to supernatural powers andphenomena as its characters attempt tofind meaning in an unstable worldfull of misfortune. Medieval thinkers from Boethius to Dante may haveplaced Fortune in subservience to God, while Calvin and his providentialEnglish followers thought such compromise was anathema, dismissingheathenish but still prevalent concepts as“good luck”and“ill fortune”and referring to the goddess as nothing more than“a poeticallfigment”anddeceit.37Yet inKing Learthe conceit of Fortune and her wheel highlightsclashing perspectives: wishful thinking as well as the frustration offinding35Walsham,Providence, pp.167,174.

Yet when a moment later Edgar sees his blinded, bloodied father,his assumptions about Fortune are brutally shattered:“World, world, Oworld! / But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee”(10–11). Thegoddess is likewise a point of reference for other characters: defeated andcast down, Cordelia imagines that she might“out-frown false Fortune’sfrown”(5.3.6), and even the Machiavellian Edmund, wounded by Edgarand dying at the end, confirms that the wheel of Fortune has come fullcircle, thereby indicating his self-defeating nature. If Fortune becomes oneway for characters to explain the dramatic turn of events, the goddess insome sense remains“a poeticallfigment”and a conceit–another projectionof the human imagination desperately confronting a precarious world full ofsuffering and violence that“top[s] extremity”(5.3.206).Conclusion: we are“left darkling”Given the foregoing discussion of supernatural powers and phenomena inKing Lear, just how daring is its ending in terms of early modern notions ofprovidential justice, order, and intervention? Shakespeare’s immediatesource,The True Chronicle History of King Leir(published1605), with itscombination of romance and legendary history, ends happily, unlikeKingLear, as it highlights a providential order and interventionist deity thatreinforce afinal sense of justice and divine order. The Gallian King, whoinvades England and restores Leir to his throne, observes at the end aboutLeir and his mistreatment:“But God protected him from all their spight, /And we are come in iustice of his right.”He also observes just before theselines that“we came in right, / And iust reuengement of the wronged King, /Whose daughters there, fell vipers as they are, / Haue sought to murder anddepriue of life.”38It is as though the Gallian King is himself an instrument ofjust providential revenge. At the very end, too, as“alarums...soundvictory,”and as Leir and Cordella enter for the last time, the King ofGallia proclaims to them:“Thanks be to God, your foes are ouercome, /And you againe possessed of your right.”Moreover, he tells Leir to“Thankheauens, not me,”39just as Leir delivers the concluding speeches in which38The True Chronicle History of King Leir, and his three daughters, Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordella(London,1605), sig.

NoChristian God is invoked and there is no sense of“iustice”and reward.Instead, the ending is devastating as Lear enters for the last time withCordelia in his arms–“She’s dead as earth”(5.3.260), her father proclaims–and as Lear himself expires on stage. The contrast between the ending ofShakespeare’s tragedy and the providential ending ofThe History of KingLeir and his three daughterscould not be more striking. In his suffering andrage Lear may refer to the heavens as though they might react to hisprofound grief (“O, you are men of stones! / Had I your tongues and eyesI’d use them so / That heaven’s vault should crack”[5.3.256–8]). Theapocalyptic language augments the play’sfinal sense of devastation, asKent and Edgar observe Lear in his intense emotional agony:“Is this thepromised end?”observes Kent, as Edgar asks,“Or image of that horror?”Yetthese apocalyptically inflected questions, with their implications of somekind of terrifying providential judgment and end-of-the-world scenario,yield no answers. Indeed, there is no sense that providence, even in the guiseof pre-Christian gods, has playedany rolewhatsoever in the devastatingtragedy. We are left, at the end, with a profound sense of loss, suffering, anddestruction in a godless world stripped of providential moral significance.Shakespeare’s experimental tragedy, written in an age saturated in prov-idential thinking, thus leaves us with disturbing and unanswered questions:What if there might indeed be no providential order governing a pitilessworld and universe? What if the notion of providential justice, chastise-ment, and punishment is nothing more than a chimera? AlthoughKing Learpowerfully dramatizes, at numerous points, poignant and moving expres-sions of human sympathy and fellow-feeling towards other suffering humanbeings (“Give me your arm,”Edgar tells his suffering father in the Dovercliffscene,“Up–so.

And it does so in an age when providence and theintervention of the supernatural were, as we have seen, constantly invokedto explain cataclysmic events and divine responses to them. The playpresents a world stripped of any certainty concerning supernatural powers(despite appeals to them, both good and demonic). If Shakespeare’s playsoften“clearly assume a world in which God is immanent,”41then one of hismost daring achievements, at least as a playwright engaging with religiousconcerns, was to imagine inKing Leara godless or agnostic world.This may tell us little about Shakespeare’s own personal religious beliefs,which remain elusive, but it does tell us that he made use of the theater as aremarkablyflexible and creative medium and space. In the hands ofShakespeare, it enabled daring religious freedom and speculation, as hetested a range of religious perspectives, some of them contradictory.Shakespeare could imagine a highly intellectual, introspective, and spec-ulative Christian prince (in the case of Hamlet) who sees evidence ofprovidence (“a divinity that shapes our ends”), even as he attempts tonegotiate a world of Machiavellian duplicity that ultimately destroys him.Yet Shakespeare was equally capable of dramatically representing the pos-sibility that, when it comes to misery and human beings gradually reducedto“bare, forked”animals, there might indeed be no God or supernaturalpowers which shape our ends and give them meaning and a coherentpattern. That does not necessarily mean that Shakespeare, judging by hismost daring tragedy about extremes of human suffering, is a secular writersince his plays are saturated with religious references, language, and allu-sions; but it does mean that he was able to imagine a world where we cannotbe sure of a supernatural order or the assiduous interventions of super-natural powers, despite the efforts of his characters to invoke these inter-ventions. While we may never be able to pinpoint Shakespeare’s ownreligious beliefs, it is hard to believe that the author ofKing Learwouldhave aligned himself with the zealous Protestantism of a John Foxe, himselfa playwright who always maintained a providential perspective on the worldof extreme human violence and savagery.42What we can say, however, isthat the theater allowed Shakespeare the capacity to explore and testbothreligious and antireligious perspectives, including the limits of belief in thesupernatural, with audacious freedom and imagination.41Kastan,Will to Believe,p.6.42In this respect, Kastan seems persuasive when he observes that“religion is central in the plays, butShakespeare is not a religious playwright,”adding that it is“hard to argue that...his writings displaythe same kind of religious concern or commitment as Spenser’s or Milton’s verse.”Ibid., pp.6,4.Agnostic Shakespeare?: the godless world ofKing Lear171"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"chapter 9“Another Golgotha”Ewan FernieIThis chapter explores and analyzes Shakespeare’s most demonic play:Macbeth.

Having left behind the Manichaean belief in an independentpower of evil, Augustine struggled as a Christian theologian to understandhow evil related to the comprehensive and perfect being of God. In hisCityof God(11.22), he concluded that there can be no natural evil, since allnatures were created by God, and God only creates what is good. Yet this ledto some improbable consequences, as Augustine himself recognized:One in which evil is present is a defective or faulty good; nor can there be anyevil where there is no good. From this a strange result emerges. Since everybeing, insofar as it is a being, is good, when we call a defective being an evilbeing, we seem to be saying that what is good is evil, and that only what isgood can be evil.6One conundrum this entails is that, because the Devil is a creature, he is alsogood. Moreover, because God works good out of evil, evil is only evilapparently and temporarily.What privation theory seems towantis a sort of bleaching out of evil,which, it suggests, is hardly evil at all, to the effect that the demonic alsovanishes. Except that Augustine is perturbed by a recalcitrant and disturb-ing sense of evil’s obstinate reality. When inCity of Godhe says that eviltakes its origin from the fact that man is made out of nothing, he is veryclose to recognizing not just the primordial negativity of human selfhoodbut also the“natural”opposition to God as the perfect being which followsfrom this.7A great Christian theologian who struggled with this positive lure of thedemonic was Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. Dionysius nails demonicnegativity in the following observation about demons:“They are called evilbecause of the deprivation, the abandonment, the rejection of the virtueswhich are appropriate to them. And they are evil to the extent that they arenot, and insofar as they wish for evil, they wish for what is really not there.”6Augustine,Enchiridion, trans. Bernard M. Peebles, inWritings of St. Augustine(Washington, DC:Catholic University of America,1947), vol.iv,p.378; cf.City of God, trans. Henry Bettenson, intro.David Knowles (Harmondsworth: Penguin,1972),12.6. See also Terry Eagleton on Aquinas:“ForThomas Aquinas, the more a thing succeeds in realising its true nature, the more it can be said to begood. The perfection of a thing, he argues, depends on the extent to which it achieves actuality. Thingsare good if theyflourish in the way appropriate to them. The more a thing thrives in its own peculiarway, thefiner it is. Every being, considered as such, is good. And if God is the most perfect being of all,it is because he is pure self-realization. Unlike us, there is nothing that he could be that he isn’t. So forAquinas there is no such thing as a being which is bad.”On Evil(New Haven, CT: Yale UniversityPress,2010), pp.124–5.

Nor is it a non-being; for nothing is completely a non-being, unless it is said to be in theGood in the sense of beyond-being. For the Good is established far andbeyond simple being and non-being. Evil, by contrast, is not among thethings that have being, nor is it among what is not in being. It has a greaternonexistence and otherness from the Good than nonbeing has.8But it is difficult to sustain a tidy demarcation between the nonexistence (ofthe demonic) and nonbeing (of God). And it doesn’t help to characterizeGod’s kind of nonbeing as“beyond-being,”for nonexistence and nonbeingalike would seem to be beyond being. In its attempt to deny evil andhygienically separate the demonic from an omnibenevolent God, privationtheory actually does the reverse, demonstrating their terrifying and con-founding intermixture. Evil seems as metaphysical and transcendent asGood is.All this leads us into the weird, fascinatingly and alluringly positivenegativity of demonic evil, going beyond some of the most influentialconceptions of evil in modernity. Kant’s concept of“radical evil,”forinstance, isn’t radicalenoughfor the demonic. For radical evil in Kant isultimate dedication to self-interest, but this can’t account for thefigure ofthe suicide bomber, who has so much torn into our contemporary world. AsJoseph P. Lawrence writes,“He has sacrificed his very life in a way that Kanthas denied is even possible.”9In her famous chapter on Adolf Eichmann’s trial for his part in theHolocaust,“Eichmann in Jerusalem,”Hannah Arendt coined the phrase“the banality of evil,”proposing that“Eichmann was not Iago and notMacbeth, and nothing would have been further from his mind than todetermine with Richard III‘to prove a villain.’”10No doubt evil is oftenbanal, and after the Holocaust there are morally urgent reasons why itsglamour or mystification have to be opposed. But even if what Arendt says8Pseudo-Dionysius,Complete Works, trans. Colin Luibheid (New York: Paulist Press,1987), p.85.9Joseph P.

So here, in one of the mostinfluential accounts of the worst atrocity of the twentieth century,Shakespeare’s villains emerge as the placeholders for evil’s recalcitrant mystery.And we do seem to need some such conception of the mystery of iniquityfor understanding Shakespeare’s darkest play. After Macbeth’s murder ofDuncan, life in Scotland is reduced to the condition of Banquo’s ghost, with“marowlesse”bones, cold blood, and absent speculation in its glaring eyes(3.4.95).11Particularly for the guilty murderer, whose special torment is thathe alone is able to recover what life once was in heartbreaking moods ofwistful elegy. Such evil is in part banal:“tomorrow and tomorrow andtomorrow”(5.5.19). But it is not altogether reducible to banality. Macbethclearly remains the magnetic center of his play. Macduff, and still lessMalcolm, can hardly compare with him.IIThe preceding discussion suggests that what is perhaps the fundamentalissue inMacbeth–the soul-shaking ambivalence of evil in the play–isrelated to one of the fundamental cruxes and problems of Christian theol-ogy. But I want to argue thatMacbethis more specifically historical thanthat, that it is perversely related to the Reformation breakthrough, and thatit reveals the danger–even the strange pleasure–of a specifically abortedProtestantism.12The reinvigorated faith of Luther’s Reformation reinvigorates the Devil.Of course, as Jeffrey Burton Russell says,“The religious tensions, culminat-ing in wars, between Catholics and Protestants and among varieties ofProtestants promoted the sense that the Devil was lurking everywhere.”13More than this,“now it was you versus the Devil: you alone, the individual,who had the responsibility for fending him off.”14As Eamon Duffyobserves, the Sarum baptism, and ceremonies such as Candlemasand Rogationtide, as well as holy artifacts and saintly intercessions, hadtraditionally offered protection from the demonic; but now all that was11References are toMacbeth, ed.

Oberman writes:“Thisnewbelief in the Devil is such an integral part ofthe Reformation discovery that if the reality of the powers inimical to God isnot grasped, the incarnation of Christ, as well as the justification andtemptation of the sinner are reduced to ideas of the mind rather thanexperiences of faith.”17Luther himself writes:“If we do not have such aDevil, then we are nothing butspeculativi Theologi, who handle theirthoughts badly and speculate about everything with their reason, that itmust be like this and that; just like the...monks in the monasteries.”18“For,”he also writes, in his inimitable fashion,“I myself (if I, mouse dirtthat I am, might mingle myself with pepper) have a great deal to thank mypapists for, because they beat, belted, pressed, and frightened me so throughthe rampaging of the devil that they made rather a good theologian out ofme, which I otherwise would not have become.”19And, according to Luther, the Devil is even more integral to the strugglefor salvation than that suggests. Luther did not believe in self-justification–we cannot justify ourselves, we cannot earn happiness–we can only besaved. Savedbya savior; savedfromourselves. One of the most famous (or,rather, infamous) features of his life is that thespiritus sanctus, theReformation breakthrough and his own salvation, came to him while hewas sitting on the toilet. That toilet has recently been rediscovered byarchaeologists in Wittenberg. Unlike the door to which Luther did notnail his95Theses–French troops burned that original down in1760–Luther’s latrine hasn’t proved much of a tourist attraction.“Its continuedneglect is just as well,”writes Diarmaid MacCulloch,“as its role in theReformation story is myth, and based on a misunderstanding of thegrammar in Luther’s Latin reminiscence of hisTurmerlebnis[tower experi-ence].”20That’s alright then. The fastidious distaste of the Luther heritageindustry is underwritten by heavy-weight scholarship.15See Eamon Duffy,The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England1400–1580(New Haven,CT: Yale University Press,1992), pp.280–3.16Russell,Mephistopheles,p.33.17Heiko A.

An old trope of leveling comedy is to imagine great men and womenon the toilet; Luther may be the only one who is completely proof againstsuch lavatorial attacks and not so much because he was a connoisseur ofthem himself as because he found salvation precisely where he was mostdebased. Indeed, in an important sense the Devil comesfirst in Luther. For,in terms of our ordinary, worldly experience, the Devil’s reality isprimary;it’s what Reformation breaks through, both in the individual soul and in thelife of the church.Mouse dirt that I am: Luther habitually thought of himselfsansChrist in excremental metaphors. But, as Oberman writes,“No spot isunholy for the Holy Ghost;thisis the very place to express contempt for theadversary through trust in the crucified.”21As the killing king of negation,the Devil is especially king of the cloaca, where man cannot but viscerallyrecognize that his life is already involved with death, each turd a calling cardfrom his own corpse. It is here we are lost and so it is here, if at all, that wemust be saved. Which is precisely what the incarnation manages. ForLuther, the child“wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger”is asign that God has divested himself of omnipotence to redeem our mortalityfrom original sin.What a momentous turn-about! It isnotin our most elevated moods andmodes–notin our virtue–but in our viscerally realized degradation thatour chance of salvation lies. For only when we utterly give up on ourselvesare we suddenly opened, like aflower, to unexpected grace.Luther seeks salvation in the depths, where we are abandoned, and if thismeans seeking it among the slops and specters of nonbeing in the toiletbowl, it equally means questing after it in sinfulness and sin. In fact,ontology is inseparable from spiritual ethics for Luther: the cloaca involvesa physical confrontation with original sin. Luther’s spirituality also involvesan extraordinary embrace of sinfulness. According to the Reformer, a greatpart of our spiritual task is tobelieve in sin. He wrote in the SmalkaldArticles (1537) that sin is so deep“that reason cannot understand it. It mustbe believed because of the revelation in the Scriptures.”22Luther describedthe goal of Paul’s great Letter to the Romans as“making singreat,”affirmingthat“this letter is to affirm and state andmagnifysin.”2321Oberman,Luther,p.155.22Quoted in Bernhard Lohse,Martin Luther’s Theology: Its Historical and Systematic Development, trans.Roy A.

For you see howsecure and happy he permits the worst enemies of the gospel to be.Just think of Eck, Zwingli and others. It is necessary for all of us whoare Christians to have the devil as an adversary and as an enemy. AsPeter says,“Your adversary the devil prowls around,”etc. (1 Pet. 5. 8).Excellent Jerome, you ought to rejoice in this temptation by the devil,because it is a certain sign that Godis favorable and merciful to you.Sometimes one must drink more, play, or make nonsense, and evencommit some sin in defiance and contempt of the devil in order not togive him an opportunity to make us too scrupulous about trifles. Weshall be conquered if we worry too much about falling into some sin.Thus, if the devil should say,“Do not drink!”you should reply tohim thus,“On this very account, because you forbid it, I shall drink,and, what is more, I shall drink a generous amount.”Thus one mustalways do what Satan forbids. What do you think is my reason fordrinking undiluted wine, talking freely, and eating more often, if notto torment and vex the devil, who decided to vex and toy with me. Ifonly I could designate some token of sin, to deceive the devil, so thathe might understand that I acknowledge no sin and am not consciousof any sin with respect to myself. When the devil seeks and vexes usthus, I say, we must set aside the whole Decalogue from the body andthe soul. But when the devil throws our sins up to us and declares wedeserve death and hell, then we ought to say,“Indeed, I confess that Ideserve death and hell, but what afterwards? Will I therefore becondemned eternally?”By no means. For I know a certain one, whosuffered and made satisfaction for me, and he is called Jesus Christ, theSon of God. Where he is, there I shall be also.Yours,Martin Luther2524Quoted in Oberman,Luther,p.320.25See Martin Luther,Letters of Spiritual Counsel, ed. and trans. Theodore G.

But lest wethink that Luther is just toying with sins so trifling that we can barely thinkof them as real sins at all, it is worth turning to his Commentary onGalatians, where he praises Christ as the“greatest transgressor, murderer,adulterer, thief, rebel, blasphemer, &c. that ever was or could be in all theworld.”26The point is that Christ, by virtue of taking our transgressions onhim, is in sin, and it is there that he brings us salvation. And, indeed, whereelse would we have it? We would have no need of it were it not for sin.Much as in his letter to Jerome, Luther writes elsewhere:When I awoke last night, the Devil came and wanted to debate with me; herebuked and reproached me, arguing that I was a sinner. To this I replied:Tell me something new, Devil! I already know that perfectly well; I havecommitted many a solid and real sin. Indeed there must be good honestsins–not fabricated and invented ones–for God to forgive for His belovedSon’s sake, who took all my sins upon Him so that now the sins I havecommitted are no longer mine but belong to Christ. This wonderful gift ofGod I am not prepared to deny, but want to acknowledge and confess.27Note that, in the letter to Jerome, Luther associates self-security and happi-ness and holy pride with“the enemies of the gospel,”with Eck and Zwingli,with those that he regarded as dangerously off-track in religion. The tricksyDevil tries to save us for himself by making us believe in our own morality.We can defeat him only by trying not to deserve anything other than deathand Hell, recognizing that that is indeed, ineluctably, what we deserve and socasting ourselves on the mercy of God, which is the only thing that can saveus. Luther’s is an adrenalized spirituality of extraordinary opposed intensities:of the blackest gloom and doom suddenly irradiated with unearthly andunwarranted life. It is already intensely dramatic, not least because of theterrible risk involved. Resigning oneself to sin and death is the only way toovercome such things, but what if the gamble doesn’t pay off,whatiftherescuerdoesn’tstoop to scoop up the sinner? What if there is no rescuer?28Luther goes so far, in his letter to Jerome, as to regard moral scrupulosityas Satanic. Elsewhere he said of himself and his fellow Reformers,“Life is asevil among us as among the papists,”and“there are just as many bad26See Martin Luther,Selections from his Writings, ed. John Dillenberger (Garden City, NY: Anchor,1961), p.135.27Quoted in Oberman,Luther, pp.105–6.28On Shakespeare’s representation of a potentially godless world in another of his tragedies, seeChapter8above.“Another Golgotha”179"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Christians among us as under the pope.”29In the letter to Jerome, he evensays we must tear“the whole Decalogue”(the Ten Commandments) out ofour hearts. This is because“Christ has cancelled and torn in pieces thehandwriting of our consciences,”30a statement that oddly resonates withMacbeth’s“Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond / Which keeps mepale”(3.2.52–3). In fact, Christ has abolished conscience as such. AsOberman notes, when Luther defines a Christian as one who walks a“straight and narrow way,”“this is not a reference to the‘straight gate’and the‘narrow way’of those monks and puritans who forgo the joys of lifeon the‘broad way’so as to maintain clear consciences. No, it is a difficultpainful path because it leads to the near mystical experience of being tornout of one’s conscience, the conscience that seeks peace in its own holiness.”This is an extremely radical move because it tears morality itself out by theroot. It goes well beyond the moral radicalism of our own time, which neverdreams of stepping beyond conscience. As Oberman says further,“Centuries of Western formation of conscience must be overcome if sayingyes to God means saying no to one’s own conscience.”31Lutheran salvationinvolves a scarcely thinkable passivity:“Why, do we then do nothing? Dowe work nothing for the obtaining of this righteousness? I answer: Nothingat all.”For Christ’s gift takes us to a place utterly beyond morality.“Here nosin is perceived, no terror or remorse of conscience is felt; for in thisheavenly righteousness sin can have no place: for there is no law, andwhere no law is, there can be no transgression”(Romans4:15).32By virtue of pure passivity–by what came to be known theologically asimputation–Luther gets his life back. But he had taken a terrible risk.Sinbravely!Nothing, perhaps, illustrates this better than Luther the ex-monk’smarriage to Catherine of Bora, a runaway nun. At that time the consumma-tion of a marriage was attested to by a witness at the bridal bed. Luther’swasJustus Jonas, his closest friend. And Justus wept to witness Luther in bed withCatherine. Our modern, knee-jerk reaction is no doubt to applaud thisentrance into active sexuality, but we need to recognize that this entails theworld-historical failure of an effort to transcend merely mortal desires andindeed the whole cycle of death and generation with which they are involved.I perhaps should break offto say at this point that I see Luther’s life asnothing less than an event in western Christianity, indeed in western culture29Quoted in Oberman,Luther, pp.57and150.30Martin Luther,The Table Talk or Familiar Discourse of Martin Luther, trans.

It is instructive hereto glance sideways for a moment at Catholic spirituality, at St. John of theCross’s mysticvia negativainThe Dark Night of the Soul, which alsoinvolves a total renunciation of human worth and capacity in favor ofGod’s grace.33But I say so only to demonstrate that a“Lutheran”perspec-tive is for far more than Luther–or even Protestants–alone.Luther always remained very aware of what a terrible risk he had taken,for himself and for others, writing that“[t]he devil often casts thus into mybreast: How if thy doctrine be false and erroneous, wherewith the pope, themass, friars and nuns are thus dejected and startled?at which the sour sweathas drizzled from me.”34In the event, his was a good death.ButSin bravely,magnify in sin,believe in sin: these were great gifts of thegreat and pious doctor to the tragic dramatists of the early modern period,and they dared to go where he did not.IIIIt is no accident that Doctor Faustus works at Luther’s university becauseFaustus’s career exposes the demonic recklessness involved in theReformation breakthrough: to participate in and affirm one’s own abandon-ment to sin and negation is, at least temporarily, to hand oneself over to theDevil, even if all the while hoping and bidding for God’s grace.Protestantism can short-circuit, stopping in the midst of sin. Salvationdoes not always follow sin as day does night because, as Luther half under-stood, and Renaissance dramatists knew more vividly and fully, sin can beperversely attractive. Witness this famous moment fromDoctor Faustus:Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.[They kiss.]Her lips suck forth my soul. See where itflies!Come, Helen, come give me my soul again.[They kiss again.]Here will I dwell, for heaven be in these lips,And all is dross that is not Helena.(5.1.91–7)3533St. John of the Cross,The Dark Night of the Soul, ed.

Spiritualdeath seems paradoxically to proffer another kind of immortality.Give memy soul again; heaven be in these lips. This sort of erotic Faustianism attainsits fullest expression centuries later in Mozart’sDon Giovanni, for whomoverreaching erotic sin becomes the very savor and meaning of existence.But meanwhile Marlowe, in hisDoctor Faustus, has discovered a majorpotential problem with the Reformation–if it leads into the cloaca, wemight, perversely, discover that we like being there and choose a life ofsinning bravely not as a cry to God to intervene, but rather for its own sake.IVFaustus sins bravely, but his sinning is in part a superficial affair. Thecharacter who sins most bravely and terribly in all drama is surelyMacbeth, or Macbeth and his“fiend-like queen”(5.7.99).Macbethcouldhave been a central text of reformed Protestantism–for who sins morebravely than Macbeth, who comes more to know himself as a sinner? Whatplay more magnifies sin? But this tragedy of sin stops short; it does not setoffthe absolute freedom of grace by lavishing it on its tainted murderer: in avery different context, centuries later, it is Dostoevsky’sCrime andPunishmentthat does this.The true devil in Shakespeare’s tragedy is perhaps Macbeth himself.Certainly, Lucifer is even more missing than Mephistopheles. And yet,it’s made very clear that the stakes of the play include damnation, mostfamously when Macbeth yells in exultant defiance,“lay on Macduff/ Anddamned be he whofirst cries‘Hold, enough!’”(5.7.63–4). He is attemptingto turn damnation to his own purposes here, but Macduffhas already said,when at last he set eyes on his great antagonist,“Turn hell hound, turn”(5.7.33). And Macbeth has lamented in soliloquy about how he had given“mine eternal jewel...to the common enemy of man”(3.1.67–8). Runningin parallel to this is a more powerfully immanent metaphysics where, as weshall see, Hell is realized in and as Macbeth’s Scotland; and inMacbeth,asisnot the case in Marlowe’sFaustus, there is no supernatural elsewhere toweaken this perception. This occasionally becomes explicit. If LadyMacbeth is“hisfiend-like queen,”Macbeth is“thisfiend of Scotland”(5.7.99,4.3.233). He isn’t servant to Satan, he is attended by Seyton. Andthere is one textual indication that he has usurped not just Duncan but theDevil himself.182Ewan Fernie"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"young sewardWhat is thy name?macbethThou’lt be afraid to hear it.young sewardNo: though thou call’st thyself a hotter nameThan any is in Hell.macbethMy name’s Macbeth.young sewardThe Devil himself could not pronounce a titleMore hateful to mine ear.(5.7.5–9)Macbeth’s is a hotter name than any in Hell, and more hateful than theDevil’s own name.

Henry Paul makes a pioneering linkbetween Shakespeare’s tragedy, demonology, and royalist politics inThe Royal Play of Macbeth(NewYork: Macmillan,1950). Stuart Clark notes that James I’s own treatise,Daemonologie, is in part astatement about ideal monarchy; James presents witchcraft as the highest treason since it is“treasonagainst God,”“analogous to treason against the Prince”(“King James’sDaemonologie: Witchcraft andKingship,”inThe Damned Art: Essays in the Literature of Witchcraft, ed. Sydney Anglo [London:Routledge & Kegan Paul,1977], pp.156–7). Peter Stallybrass concurs that James’s views“setideological limits”toMacbeth, and that the representation of the demonic in the play serves in theway of“developing a particular conceptualization of social and political order”(“MacbethandWitchcraft,”inFocus on Macbeth, ed. John Russell Brown [London: Routledge & Kegan Paul,1982], pp.192,201). Gary Wills argues that the play appeals to anti-Catholic sentiments in the wake ofthe Gunpowder Plot (Witches and Jesuits: Shakespeare’s“Macbeth”[Oxford University Press,1995]).Jans Frans van Dijkhuizen offers an importantly qualified view when he writes that“Macbethstages ametaphorical expulsion of the forces of the demonic, represented by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth,from the body politic. In doing so, the play employs demonic possession as an emblem of theviolation of sacred kingship. At the same time,Macbethcaters to James’s skepticism towards demonicpossession. Taken together, these factors suggest that the play is an exercise in politically orthodox,royalist demonology. ButMacbethalso undermines orthodox demonological positions”(Theatre:Demonic Possession and Exorcism in English Renaissance Drama,1558–1642[Woodbridge:D. S. Brewer,2007], p.140). We need, perhaps, to return to an older critical tradition for arecognition of just how subversiveMacbethis: see Helen Gardner,“Milton’s‘Satan’and theTheme of Damnation in Elizabethan Tragedy,”in Arthur E. Baker (ed.),Milton: Modern Essays inCriticism(Oxford University Press,1965), pp.205–17. I quote from Gardner below. Molly Smithengages with the“Augustinian concept of evil as incompleteness”but without following Macbeth’sjourney into evil and privation (The Darker World Within: Evil in the Tragedies of Shakespeare and hisSuccessors[London: Associated University Presses,1991], p.16; see esp. ch.2,“Evil as Nonbeing:Physical and Mental Fragmentation”). Ned Lukacher writes suggestively,“InMacbethShakespeareresumes his dwelling place near the default in Being and moves still closer to the silent play of thelanguage of the daemon”(Daemonic Figures: Shakespeare and the Question of Conscience[Ithaca, NY:Cornell University Press,1994], p.163).

Macbeth’s reference to the rape ofLucrece in his bloody dagger soliloquy (2.2.55–6) underscores the connec-tion between the sinful Macbeth’s crime and erotic compulsion–bothleading to self-destruction.In an incisive and enlightening essay, Helen Gardner characterizes thedemonic, in Milton,Faustus, andMacbeth,asa“rebellion against theessential fact of things,”writing further that, in all these cases,“[t]he initialact is an act against nature, it is a primal sin, in that it contradicts the‘essential fact of things,’and its author knows that it does so.”37This initialact is terrible in the modern sense of dispiritingly bad but also in that morespirited sense that shades into the sublime. It is very explicitly an act againstbeing or creation and therefore demonic in that classical sense. Duncan’smurder can’t be grasped or understood; it involves a certain negativesplendor, as though of some dreadfullyflowering thing. In the extraordinarypoetry of Macduff’s reaction–Duncan’s murder unblocks unwontedeloquence in the Thane of Fife–it is not merely an achievement, it’sagreat work of art. It also is a vision, one which brings the end in sight,a vision of“the great doom’s image,”of“death itself.”At the same time itspells the endofsight:“destroy your sight / With a new gorgon.”It isvision’s consummation, or extinguishing.Wenever see it, or enter thekilling chamber. And it is just as well since as Macduffintuits that, aswith God, it is not possible to look upon it and live.Malcolm, Banquo,As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,To countenance this horror.(2.3.53–5)It’s as if the murder had pulled the plug on the world, draining all life fromthose left to witness it. Alternatively, when Donalbain asks,“What isamiss?”, Macbeth answers for everyone, himself included:You are, and do not know’t:The spring, the head, the fountain of your bloodIs stopped, the very source of it is stopped.(2.3.72ff.)In both cases, we are asked to imagine a world of men rendered not just deadbut, as it were, drained and translucent. It’s a weird thought, appropriatelyenough for this weird play, but also powerful testimony to the heart-stopping power of a masterpiece we shall never see, an absolute truth weshall never penetrate, even though it is, as the truth of death, the truth towhich we ourselves are destined.Macbethmakes Duncan’s death strangely37Gardner,“Milton’s‘Satan,’”pp.206,207.184Ewan Fernie"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"and disturbingly desirable, as much in the mouth of his ultimate avenger asin the mouth of his murderer.

I have suggested that Duncan’s murder is a sortof Baudelaireanflower of evil because of the inalienable if negative splendorof its presentation in the play. In the course of the action it opens and openslike some rose of Hell, till it is seen in and encompasses almost everything.But Duncan’s murder also acts as a ritualistic induction into a new existen-tial or spiritual state, which is at once a state of death but equally andtroublingly of more vivid life. To that extent, Macbeth’s original criminalact does have the quality of the absolute he wishes for it; for a time at least, itindeedisthe be all and end all.It carries over into self-negation and self-murder for the murderers, andthis is at once dreadful and dreadfully exciting. So much is revealed in LadyMacbeth:Come, you spirits,That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,Andfill me from the crown to the toe, top-fullOf direst cruelty. Make thick my blood,Stop up th’access and passage to remorse,That no compunctious visitings of NatureShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace betweenTh’effect and it.

Lady Macbeth, as it were, unzips and steps beyond whatshe is–steps beyond humankind, and thus beyond human kindness. Thecrushed skull of a breast-feeding baby is one potential effect of this; theactual effect is the murder of Duncan. And yet, there is something desper-ately grand and exhilarating about adventuring beyond all determinism, beit cultural, biological or moral, about voyaging out into a new life totallyother to that merely creaturely order of life emblematized by the sleepingDuncan.38The implicit hope is that the life thereby gained will be what life38Walter Clyde Curry writes that“without doubt these ministers of evil do actually take possession of[Lady Macbeth’s] body”(Shakespeare’s Philosophical Patterns[Baton Rouge: Louisiana State“Another Golgotha”185"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"really is, that it will“jump the life to come”in the form of all thosepredictable tomorrows (1.7.7).“Nothing is / But what is not”(1.3.142–3);and from the far shore of suffering new life and new creation beckon. Such isthe terrible wager of this murder. A timid, superseded Macbeth says,“I daredo all that does become a man / Who dares do more is none”(1.7.47–8). Butwhatelsemight he be? The murder of Duncan is also negatively grand inthat it reduces its whole world to a condition of demonic ghastliness, wheredarkness does the face of earth entomb when living light should kiss it. Suchevents succeeding the murder in fact traumatically reveal and repeat it.When we are told of increasingly skinned and skeletal horses tearing intoand devouring one another’sflesh, we are seeinginto“the great doom’simage”(2.4.14–18).Though we tend to think ofMacbethas a play that moves powerfully andfast towards its own catastrophe, it is in fact full of generalizations thatintensify and entrench as much as they broaden the tragic effect because oftheir concrete precision and resonance with the original tragic deed.Evenlike the deed that’s done(2.4.11).Macbethgives us the worldas an image ofmurder. The great bard or chronicler of this is the critically underrated Ross.As he puts it in his most agonized statement of the theme:Alas, poor country,Almost afraid to know itself. It cannotBe called our mother but our grave; where nothingBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;Where sighs and groans, and shrieks that rend the airAre made, not marked; where violent sorrow seemsA modern ecstasy–the dead man’s knellIs there scarce asked for who, and good men’s livesExpire before theflowers in their caps,Dying or ere they sicken.(4.3.165–74)Here is the“death-drive”nationalized. All life, good, smiles, signification,and distinction fail. So pervasive are“sighs and groans and shouts that rendthe air”as to be rendered meaningless and unremarkable. Death, indeed,scarcely merits more than a shrug. In this desert place, the only alternative toanaesthetized indifference is perverted pleasure,“a modern ecstasy”–I seetwistedfigures from Spanish paintings, Dali as well as El Greco, enacting asexuality, areligionof sorrow. But such are the intense and swift transitionsUniversity Press,1959], p.87); Curry further diagnoses Lady Macbeth’s sleepwalking as a case of“somnambuliform possession”(p.89). W. Moelwyn Merchant sees the episode as“a formal stage indemonic possession–though the implications of the statement are rarely if ever pursued...[T]heimpact of the demonic invocation is reduced, both in critical reading and in our experience in thetheatre”(“His Fiend-Like Queen,”Shakespeare Survey,19[1966],75).186Ewan Fernie"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"of theMacbethidiom that these images barely register–and they’re gone.And then we are locked into a terrible vision of“good men’s lives”–a phrasewhich blends life itself with the life of goodness–perishing before theflowers in their caps. Which is bad enough, but the strange, seeminglyredundant–and so suggestivelydead–half-line which succeeds it carries usright back into the dying. Or is it, this time, into the dying of theflowers?It’s not clear, to the effect that we aresimultaneouslylost in the dying of goodmen and strangely lingering among their corpses, watching the blooms goout like lights in their hat brims. But then thefullphrase,“Dying or ere theysicken,”suggests something else:“good men’s lives”are dying not justbefore theflowers in their caps but perhaps before the men even fall ill.The killing of Duncan in very concrete and particular ways appears to bedealing a sort of death blow in general.And, as the above bears out, there is a terrible beauty in this. This is partlyeffected as a pathos of swiftness: as we have seen, images of violence areperfectly crystallized only to be succeeded, with equal instantaneity, byothers. Even more troublingly, as in the last image–of good men’s livesexpiring before theflowers in their caps–it produces such cherishing detailas to suggest that the killingfield may also be a primal scene and breedingground of love. We will return to this.What I am arguing for now is that the poetry ofMacbethis instinct with acreativity in destruction, investing the murderer not just with a world-changing destroying power, but a world-changing destroying powerinwhich strange life stirs. This is particularly borne out in the following speech:The night has been unruly: where we layOur chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,Lamentings heard i’th’air, strange screams of death,And prophesying with accents terrible,Of dire combustion and confused events,New-hatched to th’woeful time. The obscure birdClamored the livelong night. Some say, the earthWas feverous and did shake.(2.3.55–62)It suggests nothing so much as a terrible birth, as if Macbeth had strangelyinseminated the world. Its evocation of labor resonates with the use of thatword within the play:“sore labor’s bath”;“the rest is labor which is not foryou”(2.2.37,1.4.45). The air seems to scream like a laboring woman, butone who is laboring to produce a monstrous birth of dire combustion andconfused events. Things arehatching.

And it seems to produce a horribly animating power elsewhere, aswhen the arm and hand of night strangles the traveling lamp; and theenveloping power of darkness smothers up breath in the face of a worldwhich should be kissed and not killed. But the lines are arranged in strangeapposition in the quoted passage: does the earthquake result from theobscure bird’s clamor? Or is the earthquake the shudder in the womb, orthe loins–one thinks of Yeats’s“Leda and the Swan”–which precedes andis part of the process of its birth? The speech blurs and makes a mystery ofcausality, appropriately enough in a play for whose central murder Macbethis and is not entirely responsible. Human wickedness ambivalently causesand is caused by a sublime, superpersonal, demonic life that is not at allexhausted by the witches and which remains just out of reach, beyond clearconsciousness, just offstage.My suggestion is that the poetry ofMacbethinvolves a certain terribleaffirmation of the demonic negativity that Luther seeks to admit and evenmagnify so that the sinner gives up on him or herself and in desperationstakes everything on God’s grace. This threatens to undo the whole tele-ology and movement of Protestantism towards salvation, exposing theReformation breakthrough as a road which equally forks into Hell. I wantto end by looking at a neglected speech of Macbeth’s on the killing of thegrooms, which takes us back to the strange relation already intimatedbetween destruction and cherishing affection, between love and evil, givinga sinister indication of what might make the road to Hell terribly preferableto the better way:Who can be wise, amazed, temp’rate, and furious,Loyal and neutral, in a moment?

Silver skin laced with golden blood is seductive, luxurious, perverselyiconic, altogether infused with a desire that blends amorous with religious188Ewan Fernie"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"flavors. And, in that context, the gashed stabs that gape for ruin’s wastefulentrance associate the King with rape. Even when Macbeth is trying toexpress outraged horror at unnatural murder, his creepily beautiful languageis at least partly in sympathy with it. Perhaps, then, when he killed the“murderers”he was, at a psychological level, wreaking virtuous punishmenton himself. But, more importantly, the way he concludes the speech lookslike the confession, the rhetorical question, of the murderer or rapist:who couldrefrain,That had a heart to love, and in that heart,Courage, to make’s love known?(2.3.118–20; my emphasis)Macbeth isn’t a vulgarly ambitious man; it’s striking that Shakespeare giveshim no fantasies such as“the sweet fruition of an earthly crown”with whichthe ambitious Tamburlaine pleasures his self-conceit (Tamburlaine theGreat, parti,2.7.29);39but in these strange lines surfaces the awful possi-bility that the murder of Duncan unlocks terrible and profound pleasures ofdestruction that are not unrelated to love.It is difficult to know what this could mean. Except that love andadmiration for Duncan in the play seems truly to be engendered in theprospect and aftermath of his murder, and not to precede this. Indeed, loveinMacbethin general seems to postdate the thought or fact of murder, with“pity like a new-born babe”emanating from that source (1.7.21), with thefamily love of Lady Macduffdramatized only in violation, even withMacbeth’s wistful and acute love of his own life emerging only from theruin he has made of himself. Like Faustus, Macbeth is hollowed out by hisdemonic behavior and life becomes for him quite empty, but somehow atthe same time his dark voyage into sin remains a sort of superchargedmoment of negativity that exceeds all forms of ordinary existence.Macbethis a kind of perverse and empty apotheosis by means of whichShakespeare powerfully dramatizes the terrible risk involved in the newProtestant spirituality. For to participate in and affirm one’s own abandon-ment to sin and negation always is, at least temporarily, to hand oneself overto the Devil, even if all the while one is hoping and bidding for God’s grace.That grace has decayed or sickened inMacbethis everywhere apparent andis exemplified, for instance, by the fact that English Edward’s healing touchis called“the Evil”(4.3.146). Meanwhile Shakespeare’s most demonicfiguregathers to himself all the terrible truth of our“black and deep desires”andsinfully degraded condition (1.4.52). In this he is truly a spiritual hero.

Like their biblical counterpartJob, Lear and Gloucester move from prosperity to utter desolation. Onlyafter they have arrived at the bitter, empty-handed end of knowledge doeseach man approach something like the beginning of wisdom. ExtendingMarx’s analysis, one might argue that characters in other Shakespeareantragedies pass through this same arc of metaphysical exhaustion. Hamlet,for example, when faced with a bewildering series of accidental events,finally loosens his calculating grip on events, embracing instead the mys-teries of providence.2Ophelia, on the other hand, herself a victim of thesame mischances,finds these mysteries intolerable.

In our post-Foucauldian age, we are reluctant toentertain a difference between knowledge and wisdom since the latterimplies a form of truth that defies historical formalization. As presented inthe biblical tradition, wisdom is the intellectual and cultural negative ofthose historically specific“discourses”and“epistemes”that have occupiedliterary and cultural studies for the last three decades. Almost by definition,wisdom stands outside of any specific genealogical or institutional context.3James Crenshaw, a scholar of biblical wisdom literature, acknowledges thedeliberately vague intellectual underpinnings of wisdom when he arguesthat proverbs, the traditional conduit for wisdom, derive their power froman“incommunicable quality”that lends them paradigmatic force.4QuotingCervantes, Crenshaw defines the proverb as“a short sentence founded uponlong experience, containing the truth.”But if proverbs contain such truths,then those truths must persist beyond any specific historical, institutional,or even documentary context. Indeed, the power of proverbial wisdom totranscend context–to advance that which is true“time out of mind”–stems precisely from itslackof any clear genetic history or originatingcontext. Of wisdom, it is sufficient to say that it is the product of longexperience, even if we cannot say what those experiences were.5One needn’t take wisdom at its word, however. Removed as it is from thespecifics of history, what early moderns call wisdom seems nevertheless tobe intimately connected with life. Its role is obvious in the lived drama ofhuman deliberation and action, for example when a reason must be givenfor a certain course of action (prudential wisdom), or when the course ofobscure events must be explained or predicted (providential or divinatorywisdom). As a deliberative practice, wisdom thus leaves an historical trace atprecisely those moments when a society engages in more or less ritualizedforms of justification–of the ways of“God to man”certainly, but also, of3This genealogical ambiguity allows critics of historicist approaches to literature such as Harold Bloomto argue that wisdom is precisely what great literature carries from one historical context to the next.See Bloom’sWhere Shall Wisdom Be Found?(New York: Riverhead Books,2004).4James L. Crenshaw,Old Testament Wisdom,3rd edn. (Louisville, KY: Westminster Press,2010),p.62.5SeeChapter13below, which focuses on and explores a similar kind of contrast or tension inShakespeare’s plays between truth/wisdom/faith on the one hand and mere historical fact or correct-ness on the other.192Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"the ways of one person to another.6For the purposes of my inquiry, then,wisdom is a practice with its own cultural history and value: it is a meanswhereby individuals are accommodated to groups, and groups to their ownimagined or remembered histories. Sitting somewhere between ethics, folk-lore, and religion, wisdom encompasses a whole range of reason-givingactivities that extend beyond those we would recognize as explicitly reli-gious, activities that center on the search for, and sanctioned application of,time-honored generalizations to the particulars of a contingent life world.In the early modern period, this quasi-ritualistic process of reasoning outlife’s contingencies is mediated through print. Drawn from Christian andclassical literary forms, printed collections of“wise”proverbs constituteboth a distinct literary genre and a rapidly developing print commodity.Such collections sell widely in this period, in part (as we will see) becausethey provide readers with the“matter”of their arguments when they neededto justify an action or simply make a witty point. Shakespeare would haveknown wisdom literature well; its preoccupations shape both his owntheatrical practice and the context in which his plays are interpreted. Butthe popularity of printed wisdom literature, rooted partially in religioustraditions, should not suggest that wisdom is sought only between thecovers of a book. That literature’s claim on early modern life grows out ofits status as a practical adjunct to action: wisdom serves those who wish tobecome skilled in applying or repurposing proverbs (written and spoken) atmoments of choice. By exploring the nature of this literature–its materialform and uses–I wish to provide here a much fuller sense of how wisdomleaves its mark on the culture of the late sixteenth and early seventeenthcenturies.7We can recognize this mark, I believe, without attempting toresolve, once and for all, whether wisdom is a concept, genre, or culturalpractice. Likely it is all three.Because it is more than a mode of knowledge production or discourse,then, the historical study of wisdom that I wish to undertake will rangeacross cultural domains that are often treated as distinct. As a practice,wisdom designates both a semiformalized reservoir of received knowledgeand–more actively–a form of lived inquiry, one that engages the body,environment, and mind in much the same way that sacred meditation6Justification here implies an appeal to a validating, because communally recognized, authority;whenever theneedfor such authority appears in speech or print,“wisdom”stands ready in the wings.7I leave aside here the vatic, numinous forms of wisdom so frequently discussed in neo-Platonicliteratures of the period; so too the wisdom of eschatological prophecy.Shakespeare and wisdom literature193"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"practices do.8The products and process of such inquiry must necessarilyoverlap, issuing in a distinct way of living and coping with contingency, thelatter a perennial theme of wisdom literature of the sacred variety. Because itis a lived form of inquiry, wisdom generates a body of statements that cannever quite be systematized into afield of knowledge orscientia: thus, theneed for collections of suggestively incomplete proverbs that present themin no particular order.9Unlike more formal and so impersonal modes ofthought, wisdom is intimately tied to experience, albeit experience of aparticular sort. The kind of situations that seem to generate wisdom arethose that exhaust prudential and practical modes of reflection. Only whenone is forced to cope with the contingencies of“life,”as Lear must do inShakespeare’s tragedy, does the value of wisdom clearly appear. The playsuggests that in recognizing that value (“Take physic, pomp”), one gainswisdom for oneself; in making this suggestion,King Learbecomes a part ofthe wider wisdom culture I will be exploring, even if it refuses any explicitlyreligious context for such an insight.10As the subsequent discussion will show, wisdom practices of the periodencourage individuals to interpret the meaning of these unexpected out-comes with the help of proverbs, thus demonstrating the wisdom of theindividual who can productively match saying to situation.11The moststructured version of this experience is the lottery, a practice (as I willexplain) that engages moral judgment by forging unexpected links betweenproverbs and the situations they might plausibly describe. The casket lottery8One model for this hybrid intellectual-experiential form of inquiry can be found in Brian Stock’sAfter Augustine: The Meditative Reader and the Text(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,2001), ch.7. In attempting to broaden this model beyond the reader’s experience of a book, I havefound useful the work of book historians (see note22below), the work of Evelyn Tribble (herCognition in the Globe: Attention and Memory in Shakespeare’s Theater[New York: Palgrave,2011]),and that of anthropologist Timothy Ingold.

I will explore each ofthese Shakespearean examples in the next two sections, arguing that theirsignificance as wisdom practices, while complex, can be explained withreference to real early modern lotteries staged outside of the theater–practices that mechanically link proverbs to“prizes”and, in so doing,offer a sort of contrived occasion for moral reflection. This extratheatricaldiscussion will focus on two representative examples of lotteries involvingproverbs: a state-sponsored“lotterie”introduced during the reign ofElizabeth I, and a later“lottery book”by George Wither that recasts popularwisdom practices in codex form. If we recognize the links betweenShakespeare’s theatrical scenes and a lively set of wisdom practices involvingproverbs, we gain access to a set of powerful early modern intuitions abouthow wisdom is related to experience. Experience, these practices suggest, isthe great teacher of wisdom because it confronts individuals, sometimesterrifyingly, with what they do not and cannot foresee.Shakespeare and his contemporaries understood the intimate relation-ship between contingency, chance, and wisdom, seeing proverbs as a kind ofverbal fragment in which the great puzzle of the world could be contained.12As an antidote to habit or ignorance, contingency was the stone on whichmany early moderns thought judgment could be honed–precisely becausethe path of experience, unlike the progress of ideas, is made crooked bychance or fortune.13This link between chance and wisdom would becomemore powerful in the sixteenth century as popular printed accounts ofshocking or unexpected events provided a steadyflow of exemplary“acci-dents”to which proverbial wisdom could be applied.14Shakespeare alludesto this tradition inHamlet, glossing the common proverb“murder will out”in Hamlet’s exclamation that“murder...will speak / With most miracu-lous organ”(2.2.622–3).Hamlet, of course, is a play where the glibness ofproverbs is mocked. Yet even if proverbs fail as guides to judgment, theirrepeated invocation suggests that they retain a certain currency on stage. In12On the ancient and early modern understanding of proverbs as fragments, pieces of wisdom to bejoined to a situation, see Richard Harp,“Proverbs, Philosophy, and Shakespeare’sThe Merchant ofVeniceandKing Lear,”Ben Jonson Journal,16(2009),197–215.13Early moderns would vigorously debate whether or not chance events could be subsumed by someunderlying logic (which only God could originate and understand).

Critics are only justbeginning to explore broader intuitions about the relationship betweenknowledge and experience that serves as the crucial, unstated link betweenthis growing literature and the actual wisdom practices of which they were apart.15Shakespeare was aware of such practices and modeled them in hisplays. As Morris Palmer Tilley demonstrates, the plays arefilled withproverbs, the mainstay of wisdom literature.16Frequently these shortphrases are invoked by characters in order to place the dramatic action insome moral context. Polonius’s litany of old saws is a nod to this tradition,but it does little to show wisdom“in action,”so to speak. For this moreinterpretively active process of application or“construction,”whereby abrief utterance such as a proverb is invoked to make sense of an ambiguousor unexpected situation, Shakespeare turns to another domain of earlymodern wisdom practices, that of the lottery.The practice of casting or drawing lots has a long and rich history inEurope. As practiced in Shakespeare’s England, these events focus attentionon the value and meaning of contingency by manufacturing“unforeseenoutcomes”in a reliable and semiritualized fashion.17Lotteries thus play aquasi-divinatory role in early modern culture, submitting the moral desertsof individuals to a process so arbitrary or inscrutable (for example, the blind15For the exception, however, see the following section. Studies of wisdom as a concept, rather than ofwisdom literature the genre, are plentiful prior to the post-structuralist turn, exploring the range ofmeanings–from Aristotelianphronesisand prudential reasoning to divine or mystical insight–comprehended within it since antiquity. See, for example, Eugene Rice,The Renaissance Idea ofWisdom(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,1958).16See Morris Palmer Tilley,A Dictionary of Proverbs in England in the Sixteenth and SeventeenthCenturies(Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press,1950).

This process begins to unfold on anational scale when the monarch institutes the selling of lots to be drawn forprizes, something whichfirst occurs in England in1567. The formal lottery,however, is simply a version of more widely diffused practices of cultivatingwisdom, practices that seek to manufacture unexpected events for thepurpose of moral reflection. One might think, here, of Hamlet’s suddenrealization about the forces of providence that follows upon his chanceencounter with pirates on his way to England. The utter improbability ofthis turn of events points him toward the metaphysical convictions heexpresses (however nihilistically or convincingly) in thefinal act of the play.In the late1990s lexicographer John Considine attempted to provide acomprehensive definition of the wisdom literature which had become apopular genre of print during the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.18Noting that the genre has its origins in ancient Near Eastern cultures and isdeveloped in the Hebrew Old Testament, Considine shows that the charac-teristic features of wisdom literature can be found in collections of Anglo-Saxon gnomes and riddles, which are in their turn succeeded by medievalcompilations of wise sayings taking a range of encyclopedic and verse forms.19This genre was by no means exclusively religious. Humanist methods ofcommonplacing, for example, added a powerful historical dimension to thetradition, focusing students and learned readers on short fragments orsen-tentiaewhich could be gathered into“tables”for subsequent reuse. Ann Moss,Anthony Grafton, Lisa Jardine, Heidi Brayman Hackel, William Sherman,and Mary Thomas Crane have all shown how this deliberate practice ofgathering the“flowers”or“posies”from one’s reading expressed importantideas about the value of imitation and adaptation, particularly with respect toclassical sources.20The last two decades have brought considerable nuance toour understanding of what we might call a hermeneutics of redisposition thatwas employed by early modern readers–a process whereby texts could besegmented, excerpted, or in some other material sense disposed for reuse inother contexts of reading and interpretation. Considine’s vital contribution tothis discussion has been to offer a generic definition for wisdom literature that18Considine,“Wisdom-Literature,”325–42.19Ibid.,326–7.20See Ann Moss,Printed Commonplace-Books and the Structuring of Renaissance Thought(Oxford:Clarendon Press,1996); Anthony Grafton and Lisa Jardine,“‘Studied for action’: How GabrielHarvey Read his Livy,”Past & Present,129(1990),30–78; Heidi Brayman Hackel,Reading Materialin Early Modern England: Print, Gender, and Literacy(Cambridge University Press,2005); WilliamH.

According to him, wisdomtexts are collections of iterable“verbal units”: they are“instructive collectionsof brief sententious statements, arranged in a roughly arbitrary series.”21The preference for an arbitrary, rather than principled, arrangement ofthese fragments suggests that it is the compressed nature of proverbialutterances that makes their loose arrangement a powerful spur for reflection.The contents of the biblical books of Proverbs or Ecclesiastes, for example,need not be read in sequential order. Whatever verbal units they contain areexempt from any distinct narrative context of application.“Like a war club,a sword, or a sharp arrow is one who bears false witness against a neighbor”(Proverbs25:18). Any number of real orfictional protagonists can becomethe subject of this sentence. Once an engaged reader supplies that subject,the proverb has (in early modern parlance) been“constructed”: an inter-pretation and judgment has been applied through the proverb to the actionsit now describes. Proverbs are interpretively capacious, and so capable ofoccupying potentiallyanyposition within a wisdom text, because they arerelatively indifferent to the specifics of persons and situations to which theymight be applied. A proverb or any other short utterance so collected isdeliberately incomplete, such that the possible meanings of a proverb areexpanded as it is applied to new situations, even–or especially–tosituations encounteredat random, since these will tend to up-end thenatural tendency of the interpreter to consider only the obvious situationsto which the proverb applies.Collections of proverbs, posies, sentences, gnomes, and apothegms areamong the most popular genres of early modern print: they were morewidely read than texts written in continuous prose.22John Heywood’sDialogue conteiyning the number in effect of all the prouerbes in the englishtongueappeared in1546and went through ten editions before1640; Udalladapted the indispensableAdagesof Erasmus in1542in hisApothegmes(thisand other adaptations of theAdageswent through twenty editions);Baldwin’sA treatise of Morall Phylosophie, contaynyng the sayinges of thewyseis issued twenty-four times after itsfirst publication in1547.Shakespeare encountered works like these in his early education, for exam-ple, theSententiae perilesof Leonard Culman and theSententiaeof PubliliusSyrus, both wisdom collections that were popular during the period.23And,21The Book of Job is an obvious exception, one which Considine recognizes as such.22Considine,“Wisdom-Literature,”329.23On Shakespeare’s specific use of Culman and Publilius, see Charles G. Smith,Shakespeare’s ProverbLore: His Use of the Sententiae of Leonard Culman and Publilius Syrus(Cambridge, MA: HarvardUniversity Press,1963).198Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"of course, a range of writers adapted these texts to their own ends. FrancisBacon’sEssays, for example, can plausibly be argued to extend the traditionof wisdom collections into the realm of continuous prose.24Shakespearelearned to think proverbially in this culture, one in which printers served uptens of thousands of proverbs to literate individuals who wanted to“salt”their own speech and writings with them.The pervasiveness of proverbs in the printed codex offered Shakespearesomething else: a way of thinking about the vast mobility of wise sayings thatlinks their variable interpretability to the waywardness of Fortune. Mostobviously, proverbs exist to help individuals cope with the vicissitudes ofchance and Fortune, offering pragmatic or metaphysical guidance dependingon how they are interpreted. Because they are hermeneuticallyflexible,proverbs can be applied to almost any situation–even situations which,because they have come about by chance, could not have been foreseen.Nowhere is this link between chance, proverbs, and interpretation illustratedmore clearly than in the casket“lottery”ofThe Merchant of Venice,wherePortia’s future husband is identified via a contest in which each of her suitorsinterprets a chosen proverb and, in doing so, justifies his claim to her hand.The idea of a lottery seems to refer to the fact that the process of selecting theprize (Portia) cannot be mastered from the outset because the link betweenthe clues on the caskets and their contents is unclear. As with any situation inwhich chance or Fortune is seen to operate, such outcomes can be interpretedas the result of some overriding providence, as they are inHamlet.25The ideaof structuring Portia’s courtship as a lottery, however, seems more of apaternal legacy in the play when it isfirst presented by Nerissa:nerissaYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their deaths have goodinspirations. Therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chestsof gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightlylove.(1.2.27–33)The presence of such a lottery on stage is not unusual in Renaissance drama:Jonson employs lotteries inCynthia’s RevelsandPoetaster, while Chapmanstages a lottery in the opening scene ofAn Humorous Day’s Mirthin which“posies”or short poetic sayings are inscribed on randomly distributedtrinkets.26What is significant about Shakespeare’s use of this trope is the24Considine,“Wisdom-Literature,”330.25Witmore,Culture of Accidents, ch.4.26George Chapman,An Humorous Day’s Mirth, ed.

Themise en scèneis critical. Staged in the recess of the playingspace (“draw aside the curtain”), Portia’s suitors encounter a series of threecaskets, each inscribed with a“posey”or proverb. Most likely adapted froma1595edition of theGesta romanorum, the scene takes crucial advantage ofthe physical barrier presented by each of the caskets–gold, silver and lead–to the discovery of their contents,27contents which the suitors must infer byconstructing the proverb, makingthemselvesthe subject of each statement:[Enter Portia with Morocco and both their trains.]PortiaGo, draw aside the curtains and discoverThe several caskets to this noble prince.[A curtain is drawn.]Now make your choice.MoroccoThisfirst, of gold, who this inscription bears,“Who chooseth me, shall gain what many men desire”;The second, silver, which this promise carries,“Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserves”;This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,“Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he hath.”How shall I know if I do choose the right?PortiaThe one of them contains my picture, prince,If you choose that, then I am yours...(2.7.1–15)If the choices here were entirely obvious, both the drama of the scene andthe point of the lottery would vanish. Suitors must choose between gainingwhat many men desire, getting as much as one deserves, or giving andhazarding all that one has. That choice will depend upon an individualsuitor’s interpretation of the words“what,”“much,”and“all.”When thechosen casket opens, an almost divinatory judgment will have been passedon the aptitude of a given suitor, a judgment based on the construction thesuitor himself gives of the available inscriptions.Yet like the early modern lotteries I discuss below, the one inTheMerchant of Veniceis susceptible tofixes. Portia’s comments precedingBassanio’s deliberation, for example, combined with the song accompany-ing the scene, can be seen as tilting things in Bassanio’s favor. Shakespeare27Shakespeare’s source from theGesta romanorumrefers in each instance to a casket upon which hasbeen engraven or“insculpt”a“posey.”See William Shakespeare,The Merchant of Venice, ed.J. R.

Nerissa has pointed out, moreover,that Portia is the prized lot that will“no doubt never be chosen by anyrightly but one who you shall rightly love.”There is no shortage, then, offorces within or outside thefictional frame of the play that might motivatethe link between a suitor and an individual casket. For the process to betheatrically and morally salutary, however, the lottery must turn on some-thing that at leastappearsto be contingent: the reasoned choice of a suitorwho construes aloud his moral deserts.28Character differences among thesuitors, the riddling incompleteness of the proverbs, even the physicalbarrier that separates the suitor from his prize, all contribute to the sensethat the outcome of the game“could have been otherwise.”I emphasize the contingency of the casket lottery because it is bothdramatically engaging and also crucial to the wisdom practice being enactedhere on stage; to the extent that the inscriptions are ambiguous, each suitor’schoice becomes something more than a foregone conclusion. We canappreciate this dramaturgical feature ofThe Merchant of Venicewithoutoffering afinal interpretation of its densely textured engagement with OldTestament wisdom culture–present at the end of the play in Portia’sperformance as the“new Daniel”–and the narrative of Christian conver-sion which, as Barbara Lewalski has shown, Portia’s judgments help effect.29Critics cannot easily resolve the dueling perspectives that follow fromPortia’s juxtaposition of Old Testament proverbs and the New Testamentrhetoric of“mercy.”This should not be surprising, as the play offersspectators interpretive prompts such as proverbs that are themselves verballyiridescent, capable of taking on different hues. Like the proverb itself, thefabric of scriptural, ethnographic, and political allusion inMerchantsug-gests a religious allegory that is fundamentally unstable. The causes of thatinstability can be more fully understood by connecting the use of proverbsin the play to contemporary wisdom practices. These practices turn expe-rience itself into a contest, and proverbs into the pivot on which a contest-ant’s fortunes turn.28Contingent here does not mean random (although a random event must obviously be contingent).Human choices and future events are contingent, at least from a bounded (human) perspective,because they are too complex to be predicted or foreseen.

Thecontest between wisdom and Fortune is long-standing; it was developed inthe Stoic revival of the Renaissance and handled with particular subtlety inthe writings of Machiavelli and Montaigne, both of whom give Fortunesubstantial sway over the realm of experience.30Montaigne famously adoptsa posture of skepticism toward a world that can only be known through thesenses–experience providing too great a variety to be subsumed under anysingle governing idea. As Hans Blumenberg points out, Montaigne theskeptic understands that“man’s imagination is constrained by the limits ofhis experience.”31The partial or incomplete nature of experience thus puts apermanent limit on knowledge for Montaigne, who neverthelessfinds in it avariety that furnishes endless opportunities for reflection.“The scholarsdistinguish and mark offtheir ideas more specifically and in detail,”Montaigne writes, yet“I speak my meaning in disjointed parts, as some-thing that cannot be said all at once and in a lump.”Especially in the realmof human action, there is too much diversity to be comprehended undersystematic categories.32Montaigne’s manner of coping with the variabilityof experience–his feel for the almost insensible ways in which it commitsindividuals to idiosyncratic ideas–pairs strongly with his reliance onancientsententiae: the latter, in theirflexible incompleteness, hug thecamber of life’s path and provide modest supports for the skeptical observer.The variability of Fortune, which Montaigne encounters in the crookedbyways of experience, is thus essentially a goad to reflection and perhapsmoral courage; proverbs are the prosthetic that he and others will use to30As Machiavelli famously writes,“Fortune is a woman,”an association analyzed in depth in HannaFenichel Pitkin,Fortune is a Woman: Gender and Politics in the Thought of Niccolo Machiavelli(University of Chicago Press,1999).31His best-known thoughts on the topic appear in“Of Experience”and“An Apology for RaymondSebond,”for which seeThe Complete Essays of Montaigne, trans.

As we willsee in a moment, this more activist approach to wisdom is built into earlymodern practices of bibliomancy, a popular divinatory use for the collec-tions of proverbs being produced in volume during the period. It is worthnoting, however, that the practice of simulating chance events–on stage, inthe world–has its own intellectual pedigree in the period. The underlyingidea is present well before it is formulated by Francis Bacon, who in theNovum organum(1621) argues that“experience...if taken as it comes iscalled accident [casus]; if it is deliberately sought, is called experiment[experimentum].”No stranger to the collection of maxims and aphorismsin the service of productive action (moral, physical, and judicial), Baconseeks exhaustively to configure and so“try”human encounters with theworld in ways that will provoke or precipitate unexpected discoveries:if many useful discoveries have been made by some chance [casu quodam]orthrough some favourable circumstance [per occasionem], by men who werenot looking for them and were engaged on some other matter, then no onecan doubt that much more would be discovered by men who were activelyengaged in looking for them, and doing so in a methodical, not an impulsiveor desultory way.34Bacon’s natural philosophy represents a pivotal episode in the long-standing battle between wisdom and Fortune in the domain of experience.Far from banishing chance from the world, he seeks to co-opt its powers bysimulating its unpredictable turns and, in doing so, shaking out possibilitiesfor action that would otherwise remain hidden. By submitting deliberatelyto chance–engaging it exhaustively in a comprehensive regime of experi-ment or trial–he believes that the insensible grip of ignorance, itself theproduct of the limits of one’s own experience, will lose its hold on theimagination.35Far from trying to banish dame Fortune, Bacon would preferto imitate and perhaps become her.3633For more on Montaigne’s skepticism and his possible influence on Shakespeare, seeChapter7above.34Francis Bacon,Novum Organum, trans.

In the case of both formallotteries and the use of individual lottery books–the latter so called becausethey invite readers to navigate their contents by chance–an aleatory processis used to pair a wise saying, proverb, or posey with a particular moral ormaterial desert. Texts employed in early modern divinatory wisdom prac-tices include the Christian and Hebrew bibles (in the practice known assortes biblicaorsortes sanctorum), Virgil (sortes Virgilianae), and Homer(sortes Homerica).37While the English monarch only began sponsoringlotteries in the mid sixteenth century, English readers (alongside continen-tal ones) would have been familiar with bibliomancy, the art of seekingadvice by randomly opening a book to a given passage. Thelocus classicusforthe practice is found in Augustine’sConfessions8.12, where the narrator’sconversion is prompted by a child’s half-heard command to“take, read”[tolle,lege] a random biblical passage.38Jonson’sPoetasteradapts the proce-dure ofsortes Virgilianaefor the stage (5.2) when Caesar selects at random apassage from the works of Virgil and commands the poet to perform it forthe court.39The text so“chosen”reproves the excesses that have dominatedbehavior thus far in the play, affirming the aptness of randomly selectedtexts for the diagnosis of moral ills.The proverb’s role in bibliomancy is literally built into what is known asa“lottery book”(Loßbuchin German), a textfirst introduced in northernEurope that is meant to be navigated discontinuously rather than readserially, usually with the help of a device known as avolvelle.40A volvelle isa kind of paper spinner attached to a printed, radial dial on the page of abook; functioning as a sort of random number generator, the volvelle playsa crucial role in George Wither’sCollection of Emblemes(1635), an earlyEnglish lottery book that encourages its user to plot an aleatory coursethrough its contents.41Unlike the casket scene inThe Merchant of Venice,37See William Klingshirn,“Defining the‘Sortes Sanctorum’: Gibbon, Du Cange, and Early ChristianLot Divination,”Journal of Early Christian Studies,10(2002),77–130.38Augustine,Confessions, trans.

Of the epigrams inthese“books,”fifty correspond to full emblems, which the reader goeson to consult, but six confront the reader with what is known as a“blanck,”which is essentially a dead end. A typical blank reads as follows(p.61):Your Fortune, hath deserved thank,That she, on you, bestowes a Blank,For, as you nothing good, have had;So, you, have nothing, that is bad.Like a series of caskets that cannot all be opened at once, the pages ofWither’sCollectionare, by virtue of the physical affordances of the codex,“closed”to one another once a given opening has been made. Althoughcertainly not original, the design of Wither’sCollectionshows the degree towhich blind encounters with proverbial wisdom–and the notion thatproverbs were themselveslinksto prizes of a sort–was a compelling ideafor English readers, compelling enough to be formalized into an elaboratelystructured reading experience.42There is another link between this sort of bibliomancy and the wisdompractices that Shakespeare chose to simulate on stage. The possibility thatreaders might end up with a“blanck”–the“nothing”dealt by Fortune inthe example above–links the meditative practice formalized in theCollectionto the communal lotteries introduced during Elizabeth’s reign.Lotteries had a shaky start in England, and werefirst greeted with askepticism that persisted through the beginning of the seventeenth cen-tury.43Elizabeth introduced a formal lottery in a series of royal proclama-tions beginning in August1567, proclamations that promised prizes to thosewho were willing to purchase what amounted to400,000available lots or42In“To the Reader,”Wither glosses the process as follows:“if any one shall draw a Lot wherein hisSecret vices are reproved; or some good Counsels proposed, which in his owne understanding arepertinent to his welfare, let not such as those, pass them over as meere Casualties to them.”43Ewen,Lotteries,p.29.Shakespeare and wisdom literature205"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"tickets offered at a price of10s each.44An array of sumptuous prizes appearsin a surviving woodblock print that accompanied the proclamation. Inorder to attract“adventurers”to the lottery, the royal proclamation empha-sized that the lottery contained no“Blankes.”45Designed to yield at least amodest reward for every purchased lot, Elizabeth’s lottery seemed designedto avoid the situation described above in Wither, where the game stops oncean unlucky outcome has been drawn. The possibility that a lottery mightyield such a dead end is one Shakespeare will entertain when he stages hisown lottery in the opening scene ofKing Lear.Manuscript sources suggest how Elizabeth’s lottery was conducted: oncethe prizes had been“published,”collectors were sent throughout Englandand Ireland to sell lots to“adventurers.”46This process was highly disor-ganized. The actual drawing of the lots was delayed by over a year andcomprised only a meagre twelfth of the lots available to be sold, the salerequiring the distribution of books of numbered lots which could be boughtin varying quantities, each numbered lot being given to the purchaser whilethe counterfoil, labeled with the adventurer’s“devise”or“poesie,”remainedwith the collector. When the lottery wasfinally“read”or drawn at St. Paul’safter much delay, the process itself took sixteen weeks. Each of the approx-imately33,000lots actually purchased had to be duplicated twelve times sothat the full400,000counterfoils containing the owners’posies could bedeposited into the lot-shuffling box or wheel. This innovation could nothave encouraged faith in the process, nor could the accompanying expe-diency of reducing the prizes–drawn from a second box or wheel–byanother twelfth. Even the idea that there were no blanks in the lottery was astretch: while there were29,505prizes to be had (though at one-twelfth theiroriginal value), a remaining370,495lots returned a small fraction of theoriginal investment for the lot, effectively representing a loss.47One can imagine the drudgery of pulling lots from each of these recep-tacles and matching adventurers with their now reduced prizes.48Survivingrecords of the poseys and prizes illustrate the kinds of texts that were used todeclare the hopes of individuals and even civic guilds who bought them.4944While this is thefirst formal lottery sponsored by the monarch, it is clear that other lotteries musthave been in existence prior to this point.

What is dramatized much later inThe Merchant of Venice,then, is this process of making wisdom through interpretation: instead ofdigesting that wisdom into words on the page, however, the play reversesthe process, harnessing the play of contingency and proverbial incomplete-ness for a drama of decision.King Learand the wisdom playThe Merchant of Veniceparticipates in this broader wisdom culture, aculture that takes its cue from wisdom literature but is in fact part of awidely dispersed set of wisdom practices that revolve around the seeminglyarbitrary pairing of proverbs with material and social rewards. Such pairingsmust, on some level, be arbitrary–they must occur in ways thatcannotbeimmediately foreseen–since the point of these processes is to outsmart thehuman tendency to bias any form of inquiry or adventure in one’s ownfavor. One can imagine a situation in which the soon to be disappointedsuitor Morocco encounters a full description of his life and moral worth,down to the smallest detail and then chooses this particular option: nothingwould be ventured, because no uncertainty exists in the description.“WhoShakespeare and wisdom literature207"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"chooses me shall gain what many men desire”is far better if the lottery is tofunction like a bet.A formal lottery turns this process of assigning rewards to words into acompetition; interpreted as such, the opening scene ofKing Lear, whichrepresents the“division of the kingdom”into lots that will be distributed toLear’s family, is itself a powerful, if disturbing, example of the wisdompractices discussed up to this point. Freud was one of thefirst readers toassociate the casket lottery inMerchantwith the love test inLear,anassociation motivated by their common structure: in thefirst, a manchooses between three caskets; in the second, between three women.50The scenes are just as intelligible, however, as Shakespearean adaptationsof the early modern lottery and the belief that underlies them: that there issome value to be gained in submitting one’s interests to an arbitrary, or atleast inscrutable, process that pairs them with certain rewards. There is atleast one biblical precedent for reading the love test specifically as a lottery:in chapter26of the Book of Numbers, Moses is given a divine command-ment to divide the land of Israel by lot after conducting a census. Theepisode is described as follows in the Geneva Bible:52And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,53Unto these the la[n]d shal be deuided, for an inherita[n]ce, according tothe no[m]ber of names. [Marginal note:“or, persons”]54To manie thou shalt give the more inherita[n]ce, and to fewe thou shalgive lesse inheritance: to everie one according to his number shalbe givenhis inheritance.55Notwithsta[n]ding, the land shal be divided by lot: according to thenames of the tribes of their father thei shal inherit:56According to the lot shal the possession thereof be devided betwenemanie & few.51The instructions here anticipate one of the principles already seen inEuropean lotteries occurring much later, assigning rewards proportionallyon the basis of numerical participation (more land to the larger tribes who,in effect, have larger pools of lots). This principle of quantitative propor-tioning translates intoLear’s contest of speeches, where claims and50Sigmund Freud,“The Theme of the Three Caskets,”in Philip Rieff(ed.),Character and Culture(New York: Collier Books,1963), pp.67–79.51The Bible and Holy Scriptures Conteyned in the Olde and Newe Testament(Geneva: Rouland Hall,1560), p.74. The land is actually divided, according to this divine prescription, by Joshua (Joshua10:23), who assigns the two largest portions by lot to the tribes of Judah and Joshua, apportioning thebalance to the remaining tribes. The Geneva Bible depicts this division on a map (pp.102–3).208Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"assertions represent portions of love. The rhetoric of quantity that domi-nates these speeches is well developed, serving to underscore the unhappyoverlap between the apportioning of land and love in Lear’s kingdom. Asthe Arden editor of the play, R. A. Foakes, has noticed, these quantities areventured in response to an invitation to what appears to be a lottery. WhenLear turns to Cordelia and asks,“what can you say to draw / A third moreopulent than your sisters’?”(1.1.94–5), his telling use of the verb“draw”suggests the context in which to read the king’s pairing of daughters with hislands. Foakes follows the Folio reading for the verb in this clause (Q1reads“win”), asking in the gloss below,“as in a lottery?”Certain other features of the play associate the love contest with lotteriesand wisdom practices, an association that is more explicit in the version ofthe play surviving in the Folio. Before the love contest begins, Lear says thathe is going to reveal his“darker purpose,”namely that he intends to dividethe kingdom into three portions, having decided now to“publish / Ourseveral daughters’dowers”(1.1.46–7). These lines, again unique to theFolio, are spoken after Lear has received a map of the kingdom, the latterfunctioning like one of the broadsides through which the prizes from alottery were“published”(see above).52As the contest unfolds, thefirst twodaughters lay claim to what they hope will be the greater of the prizesrepresented on the map. Regan alludes to this hope when she begins herappeal, saying“I am made of that self mettle as my sister / And prize me ather worth”(1.1.76–7, Q and F). Lear is assumed to be assigning the prizes inthe contest by“prizing”or valuing the words of his daughters, a readingFrance advances when he accepts Cordelia’s hand even though she is“unprized”(1.1.301):“thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance, /Is queen of us, of ours and our fair France”(1.1.297–9, Q and F). Lear, then,is the one who assigns a particular lot to each daughter-adventurer whorepresents her claim through words, as well as the one who then matchesthose lots with the claims, as if drawing them from a drum. When Cordeliaventures“nothing”in this process, Lear draws a blank and pairs it with thisdamning posey:“Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again”(1.1.99). TheFirst Folio adds an echoing repetition of Cordelia’sfirst response, suggestinga break in the formal reading of the lottery and perhaps a cheat: contrary toconvention, Cordelia is being offered a second draw. The additional lines52Another lottery, documented only in an excerpt from the register of the Privy Council, was held inWestminster for a period of six months in1604, a year before the presumed composition ofShakespeare’s play. See Ewen,Lotteries,p.68.Shakespeare and wisdom literature209"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"allow the staged lottery to realize more fully, then, what must be the pivotalmoment of the“reading”Shakespeare is alluding to in this scene.That“reading”of the lots is a grim farce, as grim in its underlyingpsychological meaning as the assumption that Lear’s daughters can actuallyexchange quantities of love for quantities of land. Participants shoulder anadditional layer of forced belief in this scene when lots are exchanged forlove. In pleading their cases, Lear’s daughters must appear not only to agreeto the terms of the contest and its underlying assumptions about love anddynastic entitlement, but also, and more subtly, to agree with the assump-tion that Lear is not morally responsible for the outcome, since he assignsrewards by lot. What some of Shakespeare’s audience would recognize as awisdom practice has thus become an empty pageant of sorts–a punishingone, since the aged child who is conducting it (Lear) is the one who needswisdom the most.53The remainder ofKing Learwill explore the ways inwhich wisdom fails to accompany experience, a condition that the Fool,alluding to a common proverb, diagnoses with brutal precision:“Thoushoudst not have been old till thou hadst been wise”(1.5.43–4). Delivering astream of seemingly disconnected but also highly suggestive commonplaceutterances, the Fool advances the play’s perverse engagement with earlymodern wisdom culture. He is an oracle without divinity.The complete absence of providence in the play, an absence that began topreoccupy critics around the second half of the twentieth century, might thusbe linked to the failure of this initial gambit of faith–that of resolving thefuture of the kingdom in a kind of divinatory lottery whose principle ofoperation is as impersonal as it is arbitrary. While this is not the only contextin which to interpret the various failures dramatized in the play–failures ofprovidence, self-knowledge, political prudence, and familial love–the tragiccourse ofLearsuggests that the very wisdom practices that the early modernperiod found so compelling have lost their force, or at least have lost theirforce for Shakespeare. Perhaps this is why the play’s last speaker, Albany orEdgar, refuses to offer anything like a proverbial gloss on its contents: as if bychance, a Christ-like Cordelia has been killed. The gods preside over aslaughter of creatures that might just as well beflies. In its intensity of feelingand the suffering it provokes,Learsimultaneously invites a process of reflexiveproverbial“construction”–an application of a phrase like“ripeness is all”tothe events it unfolds–while at the same time suggesting that these insights53Lots were typically chosen by children, who were understood to be“simple”and so unable tocomprehend or bias the process of selection. (The classical source for the practice is Cicero,DeDivinatione, bookii.) A Lear who is aged, in second childhood, may be fulfilling a similar purpose.210Michael Witmore"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"have no foreordained value, lacking as they are in divine sanction. This is,perhaps, an appropriate if paradoxical point on which to balance a play suchasLear, one that summons up an array of religious, political, and commercialcontexts in which to think about wisdom only to withdraw from anyconfident assertion about its availability for use.Shakespeare’s adaptation of wisdom practices shows a subtle awareness ofwhat went into these practices–an awareness, that is, of his culture’semerging faith in the power of unexpected outcomes both to jog thefaculties and to prod those faculties toward proverbial wisdom.Shakespeare seems to have lacked faith that such wisdom would always befound, but he understood its grounds, particularly the conviction thatunexpected events challenge the poverty of one’s prudential and moralimagination. He may even have felt that plays are themselves a kind ofwisdom literature, not because they contain a fund of proverbial wisdomthat can be digested in Polonius-like fashion, but because they provoke auniquely engaged, constructive thinking with the intensity of the situationsthey depict. It is one thing to read in a commonplace book that“ripeness isall.”It is quite another to look, with Edgar, on his ruined father and hearthese words ring with something like truth.54A more specifically early modern understanding of Shakespeare’s plays aswisdom literature would involve thinking of them, again with reference tothe practices I have been describing here, as“prizes”to be matched withproverbs. We do not yet understand how the titles of early modern plays areconnected with their contents, and the lottery is one context in which tobegin thinking about this relationship. On several occasions, Shakespearegave his plays proverbial titles or subtitles that may have been used toadvertise the plays:As You Like It;What You Will(the subtitle ofTwelfthNight);Measure for Measure;All’s Well that Ends Well;All Is True(thesubtitle ofHenry VIII). Possibly those who went to see a play performedwere themselves engaged in a kind of lottery, adventuring their income onthe basis of a short proverb that was being used to advertise a play.55(Thepractice is not unique to Shakespeare, of course, and early modern play titles54A number of the chapters in this volume similarly entertain the idea that whatever religious“message”Shakespeare’s plays may be trying to communicate, central to his method is the goal of inspiring hisaudience to take a more active, conscientious, participatory, and/or faithful role in the religiousfictions they are watching. See especiallyChapters11and12below.55If proverbial titles were printed with some visual sign representing a particular theater, then playbilladvertisements might have born some resemblance to the pages of emblem or lottery books.

The familiarity of suchproverbial titles, then, may serve a function similar to that of the poseysinscribed on the counterfoils in formal lottery: such phrases are the place-holder for what the adventurer hazards, here the playgoer’s time and moneystaked on the promise of entertainment.That playwrights certainly recognized such theatrical“adventuring”iswitnessed by Ben Jonson, who alludes to this type of investment–linking itspecifically to a lottery–in the induction toBartholomew Fair. Here theScrivener lays out the specifics of a covenant that holds between auditorsand author. Auditors buy tickets to plays like they do lots. Some spend moreon seats, some less. Depending on the outlay, they purchase a greater orlesser right to censure the play:Scrivener...It shall be lawful for any Man to judge his sixpenn’orth, his twelve penn’orth, so to his eighteen pence,two shillings, half a crown, to the value of his place:provided always his place get not above his wit. Andif he pay for half a dozen, he may censure for all themtoo, so that he will undertake that they shall be silent.He shall put in for censures here, as they do for lots atthe lottery: marry, if he drop but sixpence at thedoor, and will censure a crown’s worth, it is thoughtthere is no conscience, or justice in that.(Induction,102–12)57Jonson, acutely sensitive to the judgments of his critics, ridicules the valueof those judgments by linking them to the amount ventured in a lottery,suggesting that a playgoer’s opinion is as variable as chance itself. If censuretakes the form of a proverbial construction, it will be hard to know whatlinks proverb to prize.Plays titled with proverbs are thus part of this contingent process thatlinks expectation–what is ventured through attendance at a play–with aparticular desert, here advertised by an enigmatic phrase that serves as a lureto entertainment. As the Scrivener’s remarks above suggest, the value of56On the early modern practice of writing interludes to illustrate proverbs, see Harp,“Proverbs,Philosophy”; Paula Neuss,“The Sixteenth-Century English‘Proverb’Play,”Comparative Drama,18(1984),1–18; and Marjorie Donker,Shakespeare’s Proverbial Themes: A Rhetorical Context for the“Sententia”as“Res”(Westport, CT: Greenwood Press,1992).57Ben Jonson,The Selected Plays of Ben Jonson, vol.ii, ed.

Noteveryone who attendsAll’s Well That Ends Well, for example, will beconvinced that the title truly describes the play’s conclusion. But like allproverbs, the“poseys”that Shakespeare“publishes”in the titles of his playscan be interpreted in a number of ways, inviting the auditor to a kind ofWhat You Willbanquet of interpretation. Sometimes, the plays succeed indelivering intelligible, even eloquent situations thatfit the worldly wisdomthey seem to convey. And sometimes, as in the case ofLear, the lotterycannot possibly pay off. A blank is drawn, the proverb fails.Shakespeare’s adaptation of early modern wisdom practices shows ushow pervasive these practices were and the depth of their theatrical powerwhen staged as a communal ritual. That ritual did not need to rise to thelevel of sacred divination, even if divinatory practices were themselvesbecoming more popular (particularly in godly circles).58For, as the popularlottery run by Elizabeth demonstrates, one could adapt the procedures ofsuch practices to less obviously religious ends. Words like“practice,”applied here to structured encounters with wisdom texts, allow us tomove between spheres that are not yet historically distinguishable into the“secular”and the“religious.”59Indeed, the search for wisdom aspracticedduring this period suggests a productive ambiguity between the spheres ofprivate contemplation, civic fundraising, and theatrical entertainment.What remains important about the interplay of wisdom literature withdrama is the lively sense, present both in Wither’sCollectionand the playswe have examined, that the search for wisdom advances through theproductive linkage of what one has lived to what one has read. LikeShakespeare’s theater, then, wisdom is a practice inseparably linked withwords that bear witness to experience, words that–in their abrupt con-cision–show the signs of long and pointed use.58Oliver Cromwell is known to have cast lots in connection with military decisions.

Astonishingly, thewife he thought he had killed with his insanely jealous suspicions returns tolife and forgives him. She turns out to have been alive all along while hemourned her loss and his guilt for sixteen years. Her survival and return areas much of a surprise to the audience as they are to Leontes. That surprise isintensified by her presentation as a statue that appears to come to life.Paulina, the character orchestrating this seeming miracle, tells Leontes thatshe can“make the statue move indeed, descend, / And take you by thehand,”but, before she does so, she says,“It is required / You do awake yourfaith.”1Her command includes onlookers in the audience as well as those onstage, and it raises several critical questions: what kind of faith does Paulinarequire of us, and what does it mean to believe in this play’s climax? Morebroadly, what does faith in Shakespeare and his plays mean and how does italternately resemble and differ from religious belief?The faith that Paulina demands of her spectators can certainly feel likereligious belief.

The late Victorianscholar Edward Dowden was one of thefirst to call these late plays“Romances,”and he discerns in them a strong religious vision. Dowdensees them as being part of a pattern of recovery from despondency in thetragedies that ultimately placed Shakespeare“On the heights”and let himregain faith in a providential power:In these‘Romances’...a supernatural element is present; man does notstrive with circumstance and with his own passions in darkness; the godspreside over our human lives and fortunes, they communicate with us byvision, by oracles, through the elemental powers of nature. Shakespere’s faithseems to have been that there is something without and around our humanlives, of which we know little, yet which we know to be beneficent anddivine.2The other contemporary term for these late plays was tragicomedy, and inher discussion of the genre Joan Hartwig suggests that an“affirmation ofdivine control is a signal characteristic.”3More recently, Raphael Lynesuggests that“a supernatural register is never far away, and often intervenesstrongly. They are wondrous in two senses:first, they are improbable (andthey make an issue of their patentfictionality); and second, they aremiraculous in a more religious sense–they bring to mind the actions ofgods, and of God.”4This intricate blend of thefictitious and the miraculous in the late playsmakes it hard to know what to believe. Marina’s cure of her father balancesan“artificial feat”with“sacred physic”inPericles(21.61–3), leaving the heroto ask“who to thank / Besides the gods for this great miracle”(22.80–1).Even withdeus ex machinadescents inPericlesandCymbeline, the happyending depends less on gifts from the gods than on the merely humanvirtues offidelity, forgiveness, and good fortune. InThe Tempest, Prosperodescribes his“rough magic”as a“potent art”(5.1.50), but inThe Winter’sTalethe magic of the last scene is qualified by suspicions that“we aremocked with art”(5.3.68). Nevertheless, feelings of mystery and reverenceremain powerful in this play.

Accordingly, several critics readThe Winter’s Taleas a kind of belated miracle play, suffused by nostalgia forbanned medieval mysteries and traditional religious practices. Phebe Jensenargues that“The Winter’s Talecan be seen to insist that the power oftheatrical, sculptural, and literary art is grounded in an aesthetics of repre-sentation and transformation rooted in Romanist ritual.”5Michael Woodextends his argument for Shakespeare as a recusant by claiming thatTheWinter’s Talehas a“clear religious undertow with an unmistakably Catholicresonance”and moves“beyond the insufficiencies of art”to greater religiousthemes of love, redemption, and resurrection.6Sean Benson acknowledgesthat Hermione’s revival is not a real resurrection but still insists that“thisdoes not obviate the parallel”with Christ’s resurrection, claiming that thesense of“faith”in this play is“preeminently religious.”7Sarah Beckwith alsoacknowledges that Hermione’s resurrection is not real, describing it as an“ordinary”miracle sustained by what Calvin dismisses as“merely humanimagining”; but she also argues that“In Shakespeare’s version of resurrec-tion, it is the agencies of both art and religion, of religion working throughthe agencies of theatrical art, that have become essential.”8For Beckwith,art alone cannot sustain genuine faith, and she dismisses mere notionsof the willing suspension of disbelief as“cognitivist”and“incoherent.”9This assumption seems deeply mistaken to me. Samuel Taylor Coleridge’sconcept of“the willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, whichconstitutes poetic faith”is paradoxical but hardly incoherent, and it is farfrom simply“cognivitist.”10On the contrary, it requires a degree of5Phebe Jensen,“Singing Psalms to Horn-Pipes: Festivity, Iconoclasm, and Catholicism inTheWinter’s Tale,”Shakespeare Quarterly,55(2004),279–306;306.

For him, good will is a point wherepoetic faith and religious faith converge, and religious belief requires asmuch strength of will as the willing suspension of disbelief. Coleridgewas a deeply religious man with a keen interest in theology.13He was alsoan influential religious thinker whose ideas have deep roots in theReformation, and that makes his insights into the power of Shakespeare’splays especially valuable. In hisEssay on Faith, Coleridge defines faith asfidelity to God and says it“subsists in the Synthesis of the Reason and theIndividual Will. By virtue of the latter, therefore, it must be anenergy...itmust be a total, not partial, a continuous, not a desultory, or occasional,Energy: and by virtue of the Former, i.e. Reason, Faith must be a Light, aform of Knowing, a Beholding of Truth.”14Coleridge’sdefinition antici-pates what William James calls“the will to believe,”but it also resemblesearlier, Reformation conceptions of faith.15During the Reformation, faith in God became the supreme virtue andsine qua nonof human salvation. From Luther onwards, reformers preachedthat faith alone saves because no merely human work could ever securesalvation. Calvinism saw the Elect as Christianity’s counterpart to the OldTestament’s Chosen People, and the doctrine of predestination takes faithalone as a means to redemption for granted. Since faith is a gift of God givenonly to those chosen through no merit of their own, divine omnipotencealways trumps human impotence and sin. In his poem“The Holdfast,”11See Richard Harter Fogle’s discussion of the“good will”required of the spectator in“Coleridge onDramatic Illusion,”Tulane Drama Review,4(1960),33–44(38).12Richard McCoy,Faith in Shakespeare(Oxford University Press,2013).13See James Engell,The Creative Imagination: Enlightenment to Romanticism(Cambridge, MA: HarvardUniversity Press,1981), p.332; and Thomas McFarland,“The Origin and Significance of Coleridge’sTheory of Secondary Imagination,”in Geoffrey Hartman (ed.),New Perspectives on Coleridge andWordsworth(New York: Columbia University Press,1972), pp.195–246, esp. p.203.14Coleridge,“Essay on Faith,”in H.

Their authors exhort their readersto strenuous and willful exertion and also anticipate James’s“will tobelieve.”One Elizabethan tract insists that“a strong faith sendeth forthearnest requestes, as a foeble faith vttereth cold & formall praiers.”18Another tract duly subordinates works to faith but then makes faith anaggressively proactive endeavor:“Faith apprehendeth (and so cannot works)and thereby we take hold on Christ his passion and death...Faith nowbeing the instrument wherewith we take hold on Christ, assureth vs thatwee are elected.”19A Jacobean treatise argues that“Christian Faith,although immediately infused by God without anie cooperation of mandoth not exclude, but rather more necessarily require[s] precedent humaneendeuours for the attaining of it.”20Even as the author asserts the suprem-acy of faith over works, he still insists that faith does not preclude work,works, or“working in matters of our salvation”; ultimately, faith becomesthe supreme work since“true faith is the soule of Good workes.”21For Coleridge, faith’s basis in divine revelation is also informed by aReformation awareness of the ambiguities offigurative discourse.

For Coleridge, symbols are the compromisesolution, constituting the proper“medium betweenLiteralandMetaphorical”as well as a medium of divine revelation. The symbols,images, andfigures in biblical discourse are not identical with what theysymbolize, but, for Coleridge, they are“consubstantial with the truths, ofwhich they are theconductors.”23For Coleridge, symbols acquire an almostsacramental significance in both Scripture and poetry, and his discussions ofthem often highlight parallels between religious and poetic faith.24Coleridge also wrote extensive commentaries on a large number ofReformation theological works, from Luther’sTable Talkthrough theBook of Common Prayer to writings of both Jesuits and Puritans. Hisannotations of John Donne’s sermons reaffirm his notion of the symbol as a“medium betweenLiteralandMetaphorical”by insisting on“the truedefinition of a Symbol as distinguished from the Thing on one hand, andfrom a mere metaphor or conventional exponent of a Thing on the other”;he then adds,“Had Luther mastered this great Idea, this Master-Truth, hewould never have entangled himself in that most mischievous SacramentaryControversy or had to seek a murky Hiding-hole in thefigment ofConsubstantiation.”25Coleridge recalls here the Reformation’s most divisive and dangeroustheological conflict, and he expresses the same desire for avia mediasolution, a solution ardently pursued throughout the earlier period. Asone early modern historian puts it, controversies over the Eucharist22Coleridge,The Statesman’s Manual, in R. J.

John Calvinobjected to both their positions, criticizing Luther for positing“the sortof local presence that the papists dream about”while objecting to Zwinglifor reducing the sacraments to mere abstractions and denying their“realityand efficacy.”29Calvin’s disciple and successor, Theodore Beza, put theseobjections more succinctly by charging Luther and Zwingli with reducingthe Eucharist to“either transubstantiation or a trope.”30Calvin and hisfollowers sought and found avia mediathrough this false dichotomy byembracing what Kilian McDonnell calls the“doctrine of the efficacy of thesacramental signs.”31English reformers soon embraced this idea of the Holy Sacrament’ssemiotic rather than metaphysical efficacy.

In rejecting transubstantiation, they concluded that sacramentalchange no longer occurred in the elements of the Eucharist, transformingthe bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. Instead, the changetook place in the heart and soul of the recipient. As archbishop ofCanterbury under Edward VI, Thomas Cranmer promoted this receptiontheory of the Eucharist in liturgical reforms and theological treatises. HisBook of Common Prayer replaces the Mass and belief in a sacrifice with anemphasis on commemoration of the Lord’s Supper and celebration of HolyCommunion.32Cranmer also wrote an extended refutation of the doctrineof transubstantiation that argues that“although Christ be not corporally inthe bread and wine, yet...he is effectually present, and effectually workethnot in the bread and wine, but in the godly receivers of them.”33He alsoinsists that“the real conversion is in him that receiveth the sacraments;which real conversion is inward, invisible, and spiritual.”34The change wasthus not metaphysical or material but subjective and psychological, prompt-ing an inner, emotional transformation. As Christopher Cocksworth puts it,in Cranmer’s reception theory of the Eucharist“the effective potential of theSacrament was a product of its affective force.”35This affective force isemphasized in a tract called“A Communicant Instructed,”where thesacrament is described as“neither acommixtionofpersonsnor an vnion ofsubstances, but aconfederationof ouraffectionsandconcatenationof ourwils:there it shall appear in theconsociationof ourpersons.”36The potency of the Sacrament’s spiritual and emotional effects clearlydepends on the reformers’belief in the efficacy of signs and symbols. In hisstudy of Tudor liturgy and literature, Timothy Rosendale convincinglyargues that the Book of Common Prayer“pivots around a newly stressedfaith in the power of representations,”including human and merely poeticrepresentations.37These liturgical reforms thus reflect an awareness of32For an illuminating discussion of the evolution of Cranmer’s Eucharistic theology, seeDiarmaid MacCulloch,Thomas Cranmer: A Life(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press,1996),pp.181–3,354–5,378–405, and614–16.33Thomas Cranmer,An Answer to a Crafty and Sophistical Cavillation devised by Stephen Gardiner,inJohn Edmund Cox (ed.),Writings and Disputations...Relative to the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper(Cambridge: Parker Society,1894),15.34–5.34Ibid.,15.271.35Christopher J.

When Mary I succeeded her brother,Edward VI, and launched her counter-reformation, Cranmer was strippedof office and put on trial for heresy. When he insisted that“Christ did usefigurative speech in no place more than in his sacraments, and specially inhis supper,”he was accused of reducing the sacraments to merefigures ofspeech and empty symbols; indeed, one of his inquisitors responded“who-soever saith that Christ spake byfigures, saith that he did lie,”but Cranmerstood by his position and disdainfully told his opponents they did notunderstand tropes.40Cranmer’s adversaries sawfigures of speech as at bestempty symbols and at worst deceitfulfictions, but he saw them as our onlyeffective means of grasping truths otherwise ineffable and incomprehensi-ble. Cranmer thus anticipates Coleridge’s argument in one of hisLaySermonsthat a symbol“partakes of the Reality which it renders intelligible”and becomes“a living part in that Unity of which it is the representative.”41Coleridge’s discussion of symbols in Shakespeare also recalls these intenseReformation controversies over the real presence. In hisNotebookshe writesthat it isHard to express that sense of the analogy or likeness of a Thing which enablesa Symbol to represent it, so that we think of the Thing itself–& yet knowingthat the Thing is not present to us.

Coleridge writes that, since there is no possibility that thetheater’s“narrow stageCockpit may hold‘The vastyfields of France,’”theChorus must ask our help in envisioning its epic battles.44Coleridgeexplains this collaborative process as one that works“by the Art of thePoet and the Actors, and with the consent and positive Aidance of our ownWill”to provide the“means to this chief end–that of producing andsupporting this willing Illusion.”45To sustain that“willing Illusion,”HenryV’s Chorus must resort to what he calls“a crookedfigure”(15)to“bringforth / So great an object”(10).

This preeminent Tudor churchman and reformer’s ideasabout the Eucharist as afigure changed over the course of his career, and,under threat of death, he supposedly recanted his presumed heresies.47Nevertheless, he was still condemned to be burned at the stake, and at theend he repudiated these disavowals from the pulpit and his pyre, thrustingthe hand that signed hisRecantacyonsinto theflames. Faith in Godultimately demands this moment of truth and allows no doubts or evasions–or“equivocations,”in the term used in Shakespeare’s time.48As thephilosopher of religion Anthony Kenny explains,“The common character-istic of faith in almost all religious traditions is its irrevocability. A faith thatis held tentatively is no true faith. It must be held with the same degree ofcertainty as knowledge”; and, Kenny adds,“In some traditions the irrev-ocability of faith is reinforced by the imposition of the death penalty forapostasy, which is the abandonment of faith.”49Of course, from theapostate’s perspective, apostasy is the ultimate truth and, like Cranmer,one must be prepared to die for it. Then and now, the commitmentrequired by religious faith is unconditional and a matter of life and death.By contrast, faith in Shakespeare allows a respite from such inexorable andlethal confessional pressures and presents within its alternative theatricalspace a far more congenial, tolerant, and humane alternative. His plays exultin the ambiguity and circumspection condemned by many contemporariesas equivocation. They also allow for the open-mindedness later praised byJohn Keats as“negative capability”that is an ability to accept“uncertainties,Mysteries, doubts”rather than striving for absolute and positive convic-tion.50The appeal of such an alternative must have been strong at a timewhen religious beliefs could have such dire consequences.47In his biography of Cranmer, MacCulloch discussesCranmer’s Recantacyons(Life, pp.584–600) andCranmer’sfinal repudiation of them (Life,p.603).48Shakespeare’s Porter inMacbethfamously describes“an equivocator, that...could not equivocate toheaven”(2.3.8–10), a presumed reference to Father Henry Garnet who wrote a defense ofequivocation.49Anthony Kenny,“Knowledge, Belief, and Faith,”Philosophy,82(2007),381–97(394).50John Keats,“Letter to George and Thomas Keats (December21,27(?),1817),”in Douglas Bush (ed.),Selected Poems and Letters(Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin,1959), p.261.224Richard McCoy"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Shakespeare’s theater relies on and cultivates many of the same responsesdeveloped by Reformed religion. His plays awaken a faith that requiresstrenuous effort, good will, and a will to believe. They depend on afigurative discourse that does not pretend to present“the Thing itself”but still allows us“to think of the Thing itself”while“knowing that theThing is not present to us.”And the participation they require sustains asense of solidarity and communion that approximates the“confederationofouraffections”and“consociationof ourpersons”ascribed to the Eucharist.These affinities between poetic and religious faith have led some critics toascribe a fundamentally religious function to Shakespeare’s plays. InShakespeare’s Tribe,Jeffrey Knapp treats them as“godly enterprises”andassigns them a“sacramental purpose.”51Knapp argues that the Chorus inHenry Vpresents the play as a“theatrical sacrament,”sustained“not onlywith the inward participation of the audience but also with the sense ofcharity and communal endeavor that such participation is supposed toinspire.”52Knapp draws here on Joel Altman’sinfluential essay onHenryV, which claims that the play achieves a kind of“transubstantiation of‘presence’and...the royal presence”by enlisting our“active participa-tion.”53There are, as I have noted, strong parallels between theatricalfellowship and reformed ideas of Holy Communion, but assigning theseplays a“sacramental purpose”pushes those similarities too far. Plays are nota means to divine grace or redemption, much less a“transubstantiation”orpresentation of a real“presence.”On the contrary, they present themselvesdeliberately as mockeries and illusions.Art’s mockery is emphasized throughoutThe Winter’s Tale’sfinal scene.Before unveiling the supposed statue of Hermione, Paulina tells Leontesand the other onlookers to“prepare / To see the life as lively mocked as ever /Still sleep mocked death”(5.3.18–20). Mockery can be defined simply asan imitation, and theOxford English Dictionarycites the lines fromHenry Vabout“Minding true things by what their mockeries be”(4.0.52–3)asanexample of this relatively neutral meaning. Paulina seems to be telling us toexpect a remarkably lifelike image of the late queen. At the same time, theOEDentry adds that its connotation is“depreciative”and suggestive of“an51Jeffrey Knapp,Shakespeare’s Tribe: Church, Nation, and Theater in Renaissance England(University ofChicago Press,2002), pp.2and19.52Ibid., p.138.53Joel B.

Mocking can also mean to deride and deceive,as well as to tantalize and disappoint, and Leontes’use of the term evokesthese more disturbing implications. Leontes is impressed by the sculptor’sskill as he gazes on his wife’s statue, but he is uneasy about its effect:“Thefixture of her eye has motion in’t, / As we are mocked with art”(5.3.67–8).The statue’s“lively”appearance stirs hopes for a Pygmalion-like trans-formation, but a fear that“we are mocked with art”anticipates that suchhopes must be dashed. As the scene develops, the dramatic ironiesof Leontes’fears ramify. As the statue begins to move, it becomes clearthat we are gazing not on an artwork but on the still living, if wrinkled andolder, Hermione. Hertableau vivantis, in the words of Polixenes,“an art /Which does mend Nature–change it rather; but / The art itself is Nature”(4.4.95–7). Hermione’s survival reverses and allays Leontes’apprehensions:art does not mockingly simulate life but instead life imitates and mocks artwith its greater vitality.Many critics conclude that thefinal scenefirmly subordinates art to life.54Yet Shakespeare still believes in art’s value even when he discounts or mocksit. InThe Winter’s Tale,asinHenry V, we can mind“true things by whattheir mockeries be,”even if these ingeniousfictions entail distortion anddeception. In thefinal scene ofThe Winter’s Talewe are tricked and“mocked with art”in two ways. Thefirst trick is the spectacle of a statuethat turns out to be a living person and actor. The second involves the plottwist of Paulina’s artful lie that laid the groundwork for this artfulcoup dethéâtre. But the impact of this scene depends on the transformation andparticipation of the protagonist. Paulina makes that clear by demandingLeontes’consent before proceeding:“I have thus far stirred you; but I couldafflict you farther”(5.3.73–4). Leontes agrees,“For this affliction has a tasteas sweet / As any cordial comfort”(5.3.76–7). She then presents him andevery onlooker, including all of us in the audience, with a choice:Either forbear,Quit presently the chapel, or resolve youFor more amazement. If you can behold it,I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend,And take you by the hand. But then you’ll think–54See e.g. Charles Frey,Shakespeare’s Vast Romance: A Study of“The Winter’s Tale”(Columbia:University of Missouri Press,1980), p.93.

Merely lookingon and listening will not suffice, so Paulina asks for a more active andintense effort.55Here too she includes us in her demands; as Stanley Cavellpoints out, a“transformation is being asked of our conception of theaudience of a play, perhaps a claim that we are no longer spectators,but...participants.”56While forswearing the“wicked powers”of necro-mancy, Paulina also makes it clear that she cannot make the statue move byher powers alone. She demands what Shakespeare always demands at thesepivotal moments of incredibility in his plays:“It is required / You do awakeyour faith”(5.3.94–5).The faith required here is poetic faith, or the willing suspension ofdisbelief, rather than a religious belief in a divine power or sacred purpose.Poetic faith requires the active and energetic participation of every onlooker,on stage and in the audience. With our help and good will, she canfinallytell Hermione to“Descend. Be stone no more. Approach. / Strike all thatlook upon with marvel. Come /...Bequeath to death your numbness, forfrom him / Dear life redeems you”(5.3.99–103), and Hermione steps downfrom her pedestal. Hermione’s recovery is not a real resurrection of thedead. Her transformation from a statue to a person is a trick that requires amore profound transformation of Leontes.“Dear life redeems”her becausethe passage of life and time has also redeemed Leontes’once diseasedimagination. Right after swearing that Hermione was killed by Leontes’cruelty and insisting that his crimes’effects were irreversible, Paulina scornshis sudden remorse and hope that“she will recover”(3.2.148) by daring himto try to save her:If you can bringTincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,Heat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve youAs I would do the gods.(3.2.202–5)55Frey, inShakespeare’s Vast Romance, astutely observes that Paulina says,“Not‘if youwillbehold it’but‘if youcan,’”implying more rigorous demands on Leontes’capacities and energies (p.161).56Stanley Cavell,Disowning Knowledge in Seven Plays of Shakespeare(1987; Cambridge University Press,2003), p.218.Awakening faith inThe Winter’s Tale227"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"By the play’s end, after sixteen years of atonement under her supervision,Leontes is so profoundly transformed that such a miracle is possible–but itis a psychological rather than divine miracle.

As this stirringclimax unfolds, we see that her seeming resurrection requires not divineintervention but only the change of heart that comes with repentance andrenewed love. After his morbid jealousy has wrought its worst effects,Leontes realizes,“I have too much believed mine own suspicion”(3.2.149). Now repentant, he also realizes that he was“transported by myjealousies / To bloody thoughts and to revenge”(3.2.156–7). His prolongedrepentance and the passage of time subsequently move him and histhoughts from bad faith to good. Sixteen years later, as he gazes on hiswife’s image, Paulina repeats his verb, rendering this passage of time and themovement of his mind literal when she says,“My lord’s almost so fartransported that / He’ll think anon it lives”(5.3.69–70). Just as his desperate“Affection”once made the worst“possible things not so held”(1.2.140–1), sonow his restored and healthy affections make possible an affirmation of thebest but most precarious possibilities: forgiveness, restoration of livesthought irrecoverably lost, and another chance at happiness.Paulina’s trick not only restores a marriage blighted by jealous suspicions,but also allows the audience a truly astonishing happy ending. We believe inthis extraordinary outcome because it never pretends to be an actualmiracle, just as Shakespeare’s art never mocks us by pretending to becompletely real or plausible. He rejects copies or simulacra so realisticthat, like Giulio Romano’s statue, they“would beguile Nature of hercustom”(5.2.89). WhatThe Winter’s Taleoffers instead is manifestfictions,which Coleridge calls illusions or imitations. Shakespeare repeatedlyacknowledges and stresses their differences from reality. Paulina is thefirstto concede the absurdity of this outcome:“That she is living, / Were it buttold you, should be hooted at / Like an old tale. But it appears she lives”(5.3.116–18). Paulina’s contrast between telling and appearing highlights thedifference between this scene and its predecessor while affirming the powerof theatrical spectacle. The talkative gentlemen in the previous scene couldonly recount events“so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strongsuspicion”(5.2.26) and taunt us with losing“a sight which was to be seen,[and] cannot be spoken of”(5.2.38–9).

Hermione in turn wantsto know how her daughter has survived since she has“preserved”herself“tosee the issue”(5.3.128–9). Paulina’s cryptic reply turns aside further discus-sion and refuses to give answers:“There’s time enough for that, / Lest theydesire upon this push to trouble / Your joys with like relation”(5.3.129–31).Herfirst response that“it appears she lives”is no less enigmatic, but, forthose whose faith is awakened, it must suffice.57Faith inThe Winter’s Taleaccepts the truth of seeming and mockeries, even if they lack plausibleexplanations. Even as they remind us that appearances can deceive,Shakespeare’s plays also affirm that at moments like this, seeing can bebelieving.Theater generally asks us to believe what we see on its stages, even whilerecognizing that all its sights are illusions; the Greek root,theatron, means“seeing place.”We must also accept our own active part in the plays shown,one that requires us to awaken our faith in illusions. Leontes has the lastword inThe Winter’s Tale, and he isfinally prepared to accept the truth ofappearances as well as his part in the play. When gripped by his mad fury, hescorned the honorable appearance of“her without-door form”(2.1.71). Healsofiercely rejected both his part and that played by his wife. Raging againstHermione, he urged all to“Look on her, mark her well. Be but about / Tosay she is a goodly lady”(2.1.67–8). He repudiated the truth of herappearance and insisted that it was a lie.

Kenneth Gross offers asimilarly subtle analysis of thisfinal scene, describing it as“a return to the commonplace, and at thesame time a recuperation of theater. The faith to be awakened is partly the faith that the cheap stagetrick was performed in good faith,”but this resolution still presents a“real difficulty”that results fromoffering“neither self-evident faith in magic nor the quiet comforts of disenchanted irony.”See hisTheDream of the Moving Statue(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press,1992), p.109.Awakening faith inThe Winter’s Tale229"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"wrinkled beauty and says he could stand gazing upon her image for“twentyyears,”joining his daughter as“a looker-on”(5.3.84–5).Perhaps most significantly, Leontes accepts both play and play-acting inThe Winter’s Tale’s very last words. His daughter is at least ambivalent aboutplay-acting and submits to her role reluctantly, conceding that“the play solies / That I must bear a part”(4.4.637–8). Nevertheless, she still plays along,intermittently enjoying her roles as they“change my disposition”(4.4.135).Eventually she triumphs in her royal role and confirms what anothercharacter calls the“truth of your own seeming”(4.4.636). In the play’sfirst part Leontes is utterly horrified by the prospect of playing a role, and hebitterly objects to the parts assigned to his wife and himself by her presumedduplicity. He urges his son to“Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I /Play too; but so disgraced a part, whose issue / Will hiss me to my grave”(1.2.188–90). He seems as appalled as Macbeth is by the prospect ofbecoming a“poor player / That struts and frets his hour upon the stage”(5.5.23–4). By the end he happily accepts his part in the play and even joinsPaulina in giving directions. Leontes is almost as curious about Paulina’smysterious means and methods as some of the others. He remarks that,while she lost her spouse in his service,“Thou hast found mine, / But how isto be questioned”(5.3.139–40). Nevertheless, he is not only prepared to waitfor answers, but he also suggests that he and everyone else mustfinallyprovide their own. Accordingly, rather than asking Paulina for answers, hesimply directs her toLead us from hence, where we may leisurelyEach one demand and answer to his partPerformed in this wide gap of time sincefirstWe were dissevered.

Awakening our faithrequires that we too answer to our part in the play.230Richard McCoy"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"chapter 12Hamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion:a post-secular perspectivePaul StevensTwo of the most famous responses to Shakespeare and Fletcher’sHenry VIIIare those of Sir Henry Wotton in1613and Jane Austen in1814. Wotton’sresponse is better known than Austen’s, but Austen’s, so I want to suggest,may ultimately be of more value. Writing a few days after the play’sperformance at the Globe Theater on June29,1613, Wotton, as everyonefamiliar with the play knows, characterized it as overly ceremonial andpretentious–its scenes were“set forth with many extraordinary circum-stances of pomp and majesty,”so much so that itsfinal effect was to make“greatness very familiar, if not ridiculous.”1Indeed, so contemptuous was hethat he seems to have taken considerable pleasure in the way the play’shubris was rewarded with afire-storm: in his letter to Sir Francis Bacon’snephew, Edmund, he is clearly delighted that the elaborate stage effects, the“chambers”or stage cannons deployed to announce King Henry’s arrival atWolsey’s masque set offafire that burned the theater to the ground“withinless than an hour”(II, p.32). But Wotton’s judgment on the play, a critiquethat has shaped so much modern criticism, may not be as reliable as it isusually taken to be. First, it is not clear how much of the play he could haveactually seen if thefire was ignited in thefirst act, and second, even if he didsee the play, he may not have been the most disinterested observer.Ambitious, often obsequious and disingenuous, Wotton loved a goodstory. His nickname was“Signor Fabritio”and he was considered danger-ously unreliable even by his closest friends: as the judicious news-gathererand letter writer, John Chamberlain, wrote in October1612,“my good oldfriend Fabritio will never leave his old trade of being a fabler, or, as the devilI am grateful to Martin Dawes, David Loewenstein, Deidre Lynch, and Lynne Magnusson for theirresponses to this chapter.1Letter to Sir Edmund Bacon, July2,1613, in Logan Pearsall Smith,The Life and Letters of Sir HenryWotton,2vols.

JaneAusten’s situation was more than a little different. Although it is unlikelythat she ever saw Shakespeare and Fletcher’s play performed, her reading ofit inMansfield Parkseems strikingly more engaged and discerning thanWotton’s; in fact, her response to the play, to which I will return at the endof this chapter, suggests what many would call a“post-secular perspective.”4Shakespearean individualism and the post-secularUntil very recently,“secular”was a term that would have attracted very littleattention. Within the space of just over a decade, however,“secular”and itsvarious cognates have once again become key words, but this time with anew edge. For many intellectuals, the“decline”of religion in the West hasincreasingly come to be questioned or relativized–that is, it is now felt to benot so much a matter of progress as simply one of change. The secular itselfis no longer seen as our natural or authentic state–what John Milbank calls“the perennial destiny of the West,”always there“gestating in the womb ofJudeo-Christianity”–but simply another way of being in the world.5Indeed, the secular, so Milbank feels, is“constituted orimagined”everybit as much as the religious understanding of things it is supposed to havesuperseded. It is not simply a process of stripping away or desacralizing, butone of active construction. The immediate advantage of this insight is that it2Quoted in the entry for Wotton in theDictionary of National Biography(London,1900),63:53.3Letter to John Chamberlain, December14,1612, in Maurice Lee, Jr. (ed.),Dudley Carleton to JohnChamberlain,1603–1624: Jacobean Letters(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press,1972), p.136.The indiscretion which“much clouded”Wotton’s prospects of royal favor was what Izaak Waltoncalled his“pleasant definition”of an ambassador:“An Embassadour is an honest man sent to lie abroadfor the good of his country”(quoted in Geoffrey Hill’s chapter on Walton and Wotton,“CaveatsEnough in their own Walks,”in Kenneth Hayes [ed.],Collected Critical Writings[Oxford UniversityPress,2008], p.215). The king was not amused.4Whether or not Austen ever saw a performance ofHenry VIIIis moot even though Henry Crawford’sremarks inMansfield Parkare very suggestive:“I once saw Henry the8th acted–Or I have heard of itfrom somebody who did–I am not certain which”(p.335). Austen is quoted from Jane Austen,Mansfield Park, ed.

That culture ceases tobe merely“early”modern or just a prelude to the triumph of the secular; itbecomes something else. Armed with this insight, the present looks con-siderably less familiar; and so for thinkers like Milbank, the age in which wenow live seems less“postmodern”or“late capitalist”than“post-secular.”6What is most undesirable about the present from this postsecular perspec-tive is laid out with great force by Charles Taylor,first in such sketches as his1991bookThe Malaise of Modernity, and then in his much more ambitious2007workA Secular Age.7The particular malaise of modernity that heconsiders most problematic is, somewhat ironically, precisely the individu-alism a literary critic like Harold Bloom and innumerable others would seeas the glory of Shakespeare, indeed the characteristic central to the play-wright’s“invention of the human.”8For Bloom, the human is essentially literary: people are truly human onlyto the extent that like all the great characters of modern literature, fromHamlet to Anna Karenina, they can be said to possess inner selves orpersonalities, that is, an inward life that develops rather than simplychanges. It develops because beings who are trulyhuman, whether literarycharacters or real people, are individuals who possess agency or autonomy inthe very specific form of the ability to reflect on and“reconceive themselves”(Shakespeare, p. xvii). We could not even imagine ourselves as human,Bloom feels, without the precedent of Shakespearean interiority. Life imi-tates art. In insisting on individual agency or autonomy as an historicalinvention, however, Bloom has learned from the“French Shakespeare”(p.9), the cultural materialism or Foucault-inspired new historicism heaffects to despise–but only, of course, to attempt its co-optation.9His aimis to reassimilate“social invention”or“cultural construction”back into the6Besides Milbank, see, for instance, Alain Badiou,Saint Paul: The Foundation of Essentialism, trans.Ray Brassier (Stanford University Press,2003); Terry Eagleton,Reason, Faith, and Revolution(NewHaven, CT: Yale University Press,2009); Jurgen Habermas et al.,An Awareness of what is Missing:Faith and Reason in a Post-Secular Age, trans.

His heroes, thecharacters from whom he derives his own much proclaimed, capacioushumanity, are Hamlet and Falstaff. Hamlet is especially important because“Hamlet and Western self-consciousness,”he feels,“have been the same forabout the last two centuries of Romantic sensibility”(p.420). Life doesindeed imitate art, he might insist, but it is our art, our creativity, and likeMilton’s Satan we know no time, at least not since Shakespeare, when wewere not as now,“self-begot”and“self-raised / By our own quickeningpower”(Paradise Lost5.859–61).10Indeed, for Taylor, this is the blind alleyof secularism, and Bloom and his heroes exemplify the intractable nature ofthe secular bounded or“buffered”self (Secular Age,p.37).For Taylor, Bloom’s autonomous subject or unfettered consciousness isanything but free; it is bounded or buffered not because it denies the socialinvention or cultural construction of human subjectivity, but most impor-tantly and much more tragically because it obscures the experience ofreligioustranscendence–that is, it denies access to the“enchanted”worldof powers and spirits, the reality outside the frame or prison-house we haveconstructed through the power of our own unaided human reason (SecularAge,p.38). When discussing Hamlet, Bloom talks much of transcendence,but he doesn’t mean the supernatural, the world of spirits, those“wondrousstrange”things not dreamt of in Horatio’s philosophy; he means the wayShakespeare invents in Hamlet an individual mind able both to define thelimits of understanding and at the same time to go beyond them, gesturingtowards the modern existentialist conviction that consciousness, even whileit stands alone in the universe, is endless in its creativity.11This is what reallymoves us, says Bloom:“we worship (in a secular way) this all-but-infiniteconsciousness”(Shakespeare,p.421). For Taylor, nothing could betterillustrate the idolatry of“the self-sufficiency or exclusive humanism...atthe heart of secularity”(Secular Age,p.19). From Taylor’s religious per-spective, Hamlet is, in fact, unusually sensitive to moments of real tran-scendence, to the“imbrication of secular and higher times”(pp.861,58–9),but when he asks the existentialist question for which he is best10Milton’s poetry is quoted fromJohn Milton: The Major Works, Oxford World Classics, ed.Stephen Orgel and Jonathan Goldberg (1991; Oxford University Press,2008); hereafter referencestoParadise Lostare cited in the text asPL.11Both Bloom and Stephen Greenblatt, the antagonist Bloom seems reluctant to name, are deeplyrooted in the popular existentialism of the1940s and1950s: see Paul Stevens,“Pretending to be Real:Stephen Greenblatt and the Legacy of Popular Existentialism,”New Literary History,33(2002),491–519.234Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"remembered–“To be, or not to be”–he arrogates to himself the kind ofauthority that denies him access to thefullnessof any reality outside thatconstructed by his own powers of reason. This is certainly how Milton, oneof Shakespeare’s most astute readers, interprets Hamlet inParadise Lost.InShakespeare’s play, Hamlet reviles conscience or consciousness for inhibit-ing action:“Thus conscience makes cowards of us all, / And thus the nativehue of resolution / Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought”(3.1.84–6).12In Milton’s poem, however, these lines are recalibrated to suggest how, inthe case of Adam, the ability of Hamlet’s consciousness or the overactivecast of thought to inhibit action is less important than its capacity to denyhim access to the evidence of things not seen and the freedom of God’sgrace. The newly fallen Adam is more than willing to“take arms against asea of troubles”(3.1.59)–he alreadyfinds himself in“a troubled sea ofpassion”(PL10.718)–but as he exercises his formidable forensic skills hecanfind no assurance of things hoped for:“O conscience, into what abyss offears / And horrors hast thou driven me; out of which / Ifind no way, fromdeep to deeper plunged!”(PL10.842–4). Only with prevenient grace, onlywith Eve’s memory of God’s word, his curse on the serpent remembered as apromise, do ourfirst parentsfind a way out of what Taylor would call theirdisenchanted state.13By casting Adam as Hamlet, Milton does a number ofthings:first, he anticipates Taylor’s conviction that the unaided reason ofthe bounded self denies us faith, and second, in doing this, he exploits whatmany, even in the seventeenth century, would consider an emphaticallysecular text for a religious purpose.For both Bloom and Taylor, a Shakespearean play likeHamlet(1601)stands at the fulcrum of the West’s turn to the secular; it allows them toconstruct grand narratives in which the one idealizes what the otherlaments. A later, much less well-known play likeHenry VIII(1613), however,confuses the issue–it has no place in Taylor’s scheme and Bloom quiteexplicitlyfinds it a“puzzle”he cannot solve (Shakespeare,p.691). While theplay in its oddness, in its characters’relative lack of inwardness, its emphasison ceremony, and its disappointingly episodic structure, complicates boththeir master narratives, it also encourages us to think about things otherthan individualism. From a more expansive post-secular perspective, specif-ically one less focused on the problems of individualism, the play, in a way12Hamletis quoted from William Shakespeare,The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, ed.Edward Hubler, Signet Classic Shakespeare (New York: New American Library,1963).13For more on this, see Paul Stevens,Imagination and the Presence of Shakespeare in“Paradise Lost”(Madison: University of Wisconsin Press,1985), pp.227–8.Hamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion235"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"that might surprise Taylor, comes alive–its central religious concerns aredramatically thrown into relief. In order to develop this line of thought, Iwant to make three principal points:first, that the creators of the play(especially Fletcher, I suspect) want to do something more than entertaintheir audience, something more than simply aestheticize the accidents oroutward shows of religion for pleasure and profit; second and most impor-tantly, that in doing so, as their redaction of English Reformation historyseeks to articulate what Holinshed calls the“grace”of truth, their play oftenseems to be responding to the form and pressure of the Church of England’sliturgy, reversing the usual practice of the commercial theater exploitingreligion and actually seeking what the Book of Common Prayer calls a“Godly unity”; third andfinally, that this in turn suggests whyHenry VIIIand Jane Austen’sMansfield Parkstand in such a mutually illuminatingrelationship about what it means to be human. Let me return toHamletandbegin my argument with what many consider to be the relentlessly secula-rizing power of theatrical performance.Hamletand the limits of irrepressible performanceIn a major essay ultimately consonant with the grand narratives of Bloomand Taylor, Tony Dawson switches the emphasis from individual to socialinvention and so presents the case for the secularity of Shakespeare and thecommercial theater with renewed force.14While fully acknowledging thequality of the scholarship evident in Shakespeare studies’recent turn toreligion, Dawson feels it to be fundamentally misconceived. Central to hisargument is a vision of the early modern theater as an increasingly auton-omous institution with its own protocols and practices. It is above all acommercial venture, secular and secularizing, relentlessly turning all ittouches,“the rags and bones of culture,”to its own independent, institu-tional purpose (“Shakespeare and Secular Performance,”p.86)–you paidyour penny and entered a space not dedicated to religion or the worship ofGod but to pleasure or entertainment: a domain that was predominantly“aesthetic and affective”(p.85). Not only was its purpose secular, but moreimportantly inperformance, its principal mode of communication, it wasirredeemably alien to all authoritative discourse, not least the sacred dis-course of religion–for the truth is that no authoritative discourse couldwithstand the essentially unstable dialogism of theatrical performance, the14Anthony B. Dawson,“Shakespeare and Secular Performance,”in Patricia Badir and Paul Yachnin(eds.),Shakespeare and the Cultures of Performance(Farnham: Ashgate,2007), pp.83–97.236Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"constant play of competing and contradictory voices, the ever presentpossibility of parody or ridicule. No matter how the words were writtendown, no one could predict or control how they might be performed. Inthis particular vision of the theater, Dawson deepens the perspectives ofBloom and Taylor, because for him the volatility of performance so fearedin the Queen’s1559proclamation, the unpredictability of the theater’scapacity for social invention, is not an alternative to but very much afunction of the individualism that preoccupies Bloom and Taylor.Indeed, for Dawson, performance and the new religion of Protestantismappear as interrelated manifestations of the same revolutionary emphasis onthe individual’s thoughts and experiences. Following John C. Sommerville,he argues that Protestantism itself, in its individualism, in the way it effects aradical transformation from“religious culture”to“religious faith,”is mostusefully understood as another, analogous secularizing movement: it is infact, in Sommerville’s phrase, a“secularizing religion”(“Shakespeare andSecular Performance,”p.86).15As Protestantism breaks consensus andprivatizes the individual’s relation with God, so, the implication is, thecommercial theater, to the extent that it is religious at all, breaks withdoctrine and produces its own multiple,ersatzforms of religion. Theepiphanic moments it offers are real but not other-worldly: its momentsof“sweaty transcendence”are truly uplifting but ultimately“temporary andprovisional”(p.87); they are matters of artifice, the stuffthat dreams aremade on.Dawson’s characterization of Protestantism as a“secularizing religion”ishighly problematic; even with some chronological“modification”(p.87), itis a paradox that any sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Protestant of what-ever persuasion would have found incomprehensible. The distinctionsbetween culture and faith, community and individual, are too impreciseto capture the complexity or extraordinary force of reformed religion–reliance on these distinctions, in its presentist telescoping or reduction ofthe past into the same grand narrative of individualism imagined by Bloomand Taylor, obscures the revolutionary alterity of historic Protestantism. Tobe specific, because of its preoccupation with individualism, Sommerville’sthesis does violence to the reformers’profoundly other-worldly emphasis onthe freedom of God and to so many ordinary people’s renewed sense of hisimmediate presence in the world. That that presence was not magical,fantastical, or“wondrous strange,”but the active work of grace, that it15See John C. Sommerville,The Secularization of Early Modern England: From Religious Culture toReligious Faith(Oxford University Press,1992), p.8.Hamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion237"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"might be made known through Scripture, whether read by the individual inprivate or heard by the community in public worship, and through anincreasing array of other media all intended to retell Scripture’s trulywondrous story of Christ’s death and impossible resurrection, hardlymakes Protestantism secular or secularizing. Indeed, it suggests that earlymodern English audiences, all of whose members were familiar to somedegree or other with the divine service of the Church of England, mighthave felt that theatrical transcendence was not always as this-worldly,temporary, and provisional as Dawson contends. An avid playgoer likeyoung Milton, for instance, was explicit on this point. Growing up in agodly household that was musical and theatrical, his father a trustee of theBlackfriars playhouse, the young poet recorded his sense of what the theatercould do in his1632poem introducing the second folio of Shakespeare’sworks,“On Shakespeare.”Exactly like divine Contemplation or“holypassion”in“Il Penseroso,”Shakespeare, so Milton claimed, had thepower to astonish us; that is, even while simply being read his plays hadthe power to produce a kind of religious ecstasy, to enable us to transcendthe this-worldly and make us“marble with too much conceiving”(line14).16When one considers the larger traditions of English religiousdrama, the immediate success of his own LudlowMaske, the didactic designof the early Reformation theater of Foxe and Bale, or the popularity ofbiblical plays in the commercial theater well into the early seventeenthcentury, Milton may not be as exceptional or as unrepresentative anindicator of what early modern audiences felt or wanted as is usuallyclaimed.17None of this, it might be argued, seriously disrupts Dawson’scentral point about the instability of theatrical performance, but even herethere is room for serious qualification.Dawson is particularly convincing in showing how secular a playHamletis, especially in the way it resists the implications of its own religiousallusions. The play may be“rife with religious reference”(“Shakespeareand Secular Performance,”p.90), he says, but none of it adds up to acoherent exposition of Christian doctrine. The Prince’s increasing“religiouscalm”(p.90), for instance his pointed allusion to the Gospel’s declarationthat there is“special providence in the fall of a sparrow”(5.2.220–1), is not quite16This point is developed in Paul Stevens,“Subversion and Wonder in Milton’s Epitaph onShakespeare,”ELR,19(1989),375–88; it is followed up in Charles Whitney,Early Responses toRenaissance Drama(Cambridge University Press,2006), esp. pp.256–70, and Aaron Kunin,“Shakespeare’s Preservation Fantasy,”PMLA,124(2009),92–106.17On the persistence of religious drama into the seventeenth century, see Beatrice Groves,Texts andTraditions: Religion in Shakespeare,1592–1604(Oxford: Clarendon Press,2006), pp.10–25.238Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"what it appears to be. In the Gospel itself, in the fuller context of Matthew10,Christ’swordsoffer a remarkable insight into the terrifying otherness ofGod’s presence in the world; the demands that Christ places on his disciplesargue anything but calm. Yes, no sparrow will fall without God knowing it(Matthew10:29), but Christ’s disciples are offered this particular reassur-ance,first, somewhat ironically–“Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more valuethan many sparrows,”if not all (10:31)–and, then, only in the context ofChrist’s demand that they take up arms against the rotten state of theeveryday world:“Think not,”he admonishes them, that“Iamcometosend peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am cometo set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against hermother,”and you, the agents of my word,“shall be hated of all men for myname’ssake”(10:34–6,22). If the overall action of the play seems to parodyand distort Matthew10–perhaps most strikingly in the way the appearanceof the ghost caricatures Christ’s declaration to his disciples that“the spirit ofthe Father speaketh in you”(10:20)–Hamlet’sallusioninthefinal act goesfurther, reducing the Gospel’s sense of transcendence to a stoic common-place on the inevitability of death, one whose primary function is dramaticor aesthetic. His words are meant to set up the climax of the play’s bloodyending:“if it be now,’tisnottocome;ifitbenottocome,itwillbenow;ifit be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all”(5.2.221–4). Hamlet’swords here ignore the divisiveness of Christ’s fervor and bring the audiencetogether, so Dawson feels, as a harmonious community“under the idea of aspecial design that affects us all equally”(p.91). Like Hamlet, the audiencereadies itself for the end, but in their reduction of Scripture, whatShakespeare’s words tell even the most religious members of the audienceis that the play’s special design is not God’s but the playwright’s. This is apersuasive argument–it does much to explain Bloom’s sense that Hamlet’sreaction to providence is ultimately one of indifference or“disinterestedness”(Shakespeare,p.429). But in highlighting the secular direction of thetragedy, it needs to be emphasized, Dawson also makes it clear that theplay’s text is not entirely at the mercy of its performance. The words matter:they have considerable power in controlling the stability of the perform-ance, and this is not merely a case of orchestrating competing voices. Thepoint is, of course, that the play’s text has the capacity to tell both itsaudience and its actors, to a greater or lesser extent, how the play is to beperformed and experienced. As Dawson’s own argument implies, as iteffectively sacrifices its fundamental premise for a much less important gain,the secularity ofHamletis not simply a matter of irrepressible performance,but of textual design, of Shakespeare’s cunningly directed, articulateHamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion239"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"energy. In this, Dawson’s Shakespeare begins to look a lot like Shakespeare’sownfictional playwright-cum-producer, Hamlet.In producingThe Murder of Gonzago, the Prince has very clear ideas onhow it is to be performed and what effect he wants to achieve. In order tocatch the conscience of the King, to show him the exact“form and pressure”of his crime (3.2.25), he wants to reduce the contingency of performance to aminimum. He wants the players to speak and comport their bodies accord-ing to specific guidelines:“Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced itto you,”do not“saw the air too much with your hand,”and do not tear“apassion to tatters”or out-herod Herod. There should be a precise conso-nance between text and performance:“Suit the action to the word, the wordto the action”(3.2.1–15). Above all, the players are not to extemporize insuch a way that they prejudice some truth or“necessary question of theplay”the playwright might want to be considered (3.2.40–5). These ques-tions or issues of the play are crucial for Hamlet. He idealizes the kind ofplay that might seem like“caviary to the general”(2.2.447), too choice forthe general public, but need not be. He remembers a dramatization ofAeneid2, which he and others“whose judgments in such matters cried o’erthe top of mine”(2.2.448–9) thought excellent,“well digested in the scenes,set down with as much modesty as cunning”(2.2.449–51). The cunning andparadoxically well-tempered representation of the atrocity of Priam’s mur-der is likely to provoke a particular reaction. This example of a well-directedplay substantiates Hamlet’s memory that“guilty creatures sitting at a play /Have by the very cunning of the scene / Been struck so to the soul thatpresently / They have proclaimed their malefactions”(2.2.601–4). In thiskind of work, the play’s mimetic and aesthetic dimensions are entirelysubordinate to its pragmatic end–it works like a speech act, an authoritativediscourse designed to effect specific ends. Here, inThe Murder of Gonzago,those ends are political and moral, but in another play they might just aswell be religious. And inHenry VIII, so I want to suggest, that is whatShakespeare and his collaborator, John Fletcher, set out to do. In a periodthat witnessed the sudden death of England’s hope in Prince Henry(November1612) and its renewal in the marriage of Princess Elizabeth(February1613), between what Sir Henry Wotton calls“our griefs and ourjollities,”18they set out to produce a play in the commercial theater that hadsomething of the force of liturgy, an act of praise emerging out of theflux ofEnglish history in which members of the audience might cease to beindividuals and be brought together in a godly unity to experience the18Letter to Dudley Carleton, February25,1613, Pearsall Smith,Life, vol.ii,p.14.240Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"presence of God’s grace in the history of their national community. Whilethe political or nationalist dimension of this move is not unfamiliar, thedistinctiveness of its religious orientation continues to remain elusive.19Henry VIIIand the grace of truthThe critical consensus since the middle of the nineteenth century has beenthatHenry VIIIis the collaborative work of Shakespeare and Fletcher.20Formany, the play witnesses a generational shift in the life of Shakespeare’scompany, for after1613, as Gordon McMullan suggests,“Fletcher seems tohave settled into Shakespeare’s role as chief playwright of the King’scompany.”21In their prologue the elder and younger writers speak as one,but, of more importance for the present argument, they seem unusuallyanxious about the play’s reception. Like Hamlet withThe Murder ofGonzago, they clearly want a particular effect. They want to control expect-ations and reduce the contingency of performance. Accordingly theirprologue offers the audience specific instructions, insisting that thisHenryVIIIwill not be like Samuel Rowley’s earlier version of the king’s reign,When You See Me(1604).22If you come to“hear a merry, bawdy play,”theprologue admonishes its audience,“A noise of targets, or to see a fellow / Ina long motley coat guarded with yellow,”you will be disappointed (pro-logue14–16). This play is“weighty,”“serious,”and“sad,”designedto arouse“pity”–working such“noble scenes as draw the eye toflow”(1–7). Most importantly, clownish improvisation will not be allowed toprejudice“our chosen truth,”for we would not forfeit either“our brains”orour reputation for truth-telling (17–20). A little earlier, as if speakingdirectly to Dawson, the prologue insists that the purpose of the commercialtheater is not exclusively aesthetic or affective–it is not simply about make-believe, producing spectacle or arousing pity, but may bring the audience toa knowledge of the truth–“Such as give / Their money out of hope they19On the play’s nationalism, see Annabel Patterson,“‘All is true’: Negotiating the Past inHenry VIII,”in R.

Hence the play’s emphaticsubtitle,All is True. While the play aspires to the status of an authoritativediscourse, what specific truth the prologue has in mind is not immediatelyclear. Itfirst focuses on truth as mimetic verisimilitude. Like the prologue inShakespeare’sHenry V,itfirst claims to offer an accurate account of Englishhistory; it offers to bring England’s noble dead back to life:“Think ye see /The very persons of our noble story / As they were living; think you seethem great / And followed with the general throng and sweat / Of thousandfriends”(25–9). In a celebrated passage fromPierce Penniless(1592),Thomas Nashe explains the value of this kind of theatrical resurrection,what Dawson calls the theater’s“sweaty transcendence.”Especially in thoseplays“borrowed out of our English Chronicles,”says Nashe,“our forefa-thers’valiant acts, that have long lain buried in rusty brass and worm-eatenbooks, are revived”and our forefathers themselves are“raised from the graveof oblivion, and brought to plead their aged honours in open presence.”Theresurrection may be feigned, but it is extraordinarily effective in promotingheroic virtue: what more than this, he asks, could serve as“a sharper reproofto these degenerate effeminate days of ours.”23InHenry VIII, however, theprologue ups the ante and implies that this kind of theatrical transcendencemight articulate a truth deeper and more other-worldly than national valor.Most immediately, it points to the contingency of all“earthly glory”(1.1.14):think you see the very persons of our noble story in all their greatness and“then,”the prologue insists,“in a moment, see / How soon this mightinessmeets misery”(prologue29–30). But as the play proceeds, so its engagementwith the complexity of this truth intensifies and the contentious historicalmatter of the King’s reign is ordered, reduced through the play’s stylizedrepetitions to suggest an overarching pattern of falling from power, comingto grace, and knowing God’s truth.Mightiness meeting miseryAlthough he feels defeated by the strangeness ofHenry VIII, Bloom is acutein recognizing how“remarkably unified”the play is (Shakespeare,p.685). Itcomprises four distinct but interrelated narratives of mightiness meetingmisery, those of Buckingham, Queen Katherine, Wolsey, and Cranmer–four“heraldic pictures with beautiful voices,”says Bloom (p.685). As eachone ends so the next begins. It is through these narratives that the primary23Quoted from Thomas Nashe,The Unfortunate Traveller and Other Works, ed. J. B. Steane(Harmondsworth: Penguin,1971), pp.112–13.242Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"but curiously unforegrounded story of Henry and Anne Boleyn is pre-sented. What Bloomfinds most disappointing about these speaking pic-tures is that none of their central characters is“endowed with anyinwardness”(pp.685–6); none of them reveal the kind of self-reflexiveinteriority or internal development that he considers essential to the inven-tion of the human. The narrative sequencing of events is“processional,”andthe overall impact of the play is alien and premodern–it marks“areversion,”he says,“to pre-Shakespearean theater”(p.686). Bloom’sresponse is striking not so much because he exaggerates the characters’lack of inwardness but because he shows so little interest in what maywell have been much more important for the members of an earlyseventeenth-century audience–that is, the sustaining presence of God’sgrace in the story of its country, even in the scandalous story of Henry VIIIand his second wife. For each of the four heavily stylized narratives thatconstitute the play is emphatic in describing the limits of human agency andrepeating a climactic, often surprising act of grace. All four narratives arestories, however imperfect, of the key characters learning the kind ofpatience that will enable them to perform forgiveness and reconciliation.Against the worldly noise of bewilderingly contingent history, of rumor,slander, and misinformation, far from rendering“greatness very familiar, ifnot ridiculous,”as Wotton contends, the play clearly labors to see a designand articulate a rhythm. UnlikeHamlet, the implications of the play’sbiblical allusions are not ironized but carefully deployed to mark out theforce of a truth beyond human agency.In the opening story, Buckingham’s angry determination to expose thecorruption of Wolsey, the drama of his imminent struggle with the“venom-mouthed”Cardinal (1.1.120), is suddenly cut short; he is rendered powerless,and the emphasis falls on the patience and consequent grace with which hestruggles to accept the injustice of his arrest and conviction for treason. Thisagonis now made to seem more important than the original one of contest-ing the Cardinal’s arbitrary rule. On his arrest, in a way that a modernaudience mightfind wooden or frustrating, Buckingham immediatelysubmits:“The will of heav’n / Be done in this and all things,”he says,“Iobey”(1.1.209–10). Scripture speaks through him, and his quotation fromMatthew6:10,“Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,”alludes to theLord’s Prayer at the beginning of the Book of Common Prayer. It is thenalmost immediately echoed by his son-in-law Abergavenny as if his refrainwere a response from the Litany:“The will of heaven be done and the King’spleasure / By me obeyed”(1.1.215–16). In Buckingham’sfinal speech thereare moments when the memory of the liturgy continues to reassert itselfHamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion243"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"and the Duke loses his identity in that of the psalmist: invoking Psalm141:2,“Let my prayer be set before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands asthe evening sacrifice,”he urges his friends to“Make of your prayers one sweetsacrifice / And lift my soul to heaven”(2.1.78–9). It is made clear in the reportof the Duke’s trial that this continued piety has not come easily. The gentle-men who report the trial and who constitute a projection of the play’simagined audience are intensely concerned that he should succeed andbehave with grace: for a moment he spoke in“choler, ill and hasty,”saysone of the gentlemen, but then to everyone’s relief“he fell to himself againand sweetly / In all the rest showed a most noble patience”(2.1.35–7). Finally,he forgives all–his custodians, his enemies, and most importantly his hastyand, at this stage of the play, pitiless King:“Mayhelive/LongerthanIhavetime to tell his years; / Ever beloved and loving may his rule be”(2.1.91–3).Buckingham’s gracious end is far from perfect–hisfinal speech still contains“too many curses”(2.1.138) for the liking of thefirst gentleman–but it isparadigmatic: it substantiates the Duke’s nobility, offers aid and comfort tothe King’s peace, and it suggests the degree to which patience is both a causeand consequence of grace. Echoing so many scriptural fragments from theBook of Common Prayer and especially its companion publication, thePsalter, Buckingham’s end exemplifies what Queen Katherine will lateridealize as a good death (4.1.9–11).24And it is these good deaths thatpunctuate the processional progress of the performance, unfolding what theplay’s key source, Holinshed, calls“the grace of truth.”25The grace of truthThis phrase is more significant than it sounds. Not only does it imply thecapacity of truth to provide a surplus of good will, to bring peace andreconciliation to the kingdom, but much more radically it acknowledgesGod’s freedom: it suggests that truth is not within our unaided power topossess–that it is, in fact, a matter of grace, the gift of God. We cannot knowtruth without his intervention and, as the continual echoing of the Psalmssuggest, this is precisely the understanding that all the fallenfinally come torecognize. Faced with execution, Buckingham reflects on his fate:“When Icame hither I was Lord High Constable / And Duke of Buckingham–now,24For the relation between the BCP and the Psalter, see Brian Cummings (ed.),The Book of CommonPrayer: The Texts of1549,1559, and1662(Oxford University Press,2011), pp.783–5.

Stripped of“such furniture as suits / Thegreatness of his person”(2.1.100–1), the truth he will now seal with his blood isnot simply his continued loyalty to the King but this knowledge of hisnakedness or powerlessness in the world. The treachery of his servants andtragic history of his family is incomprehensible, and yet, he says, bringing acommonplace to life,“Heaven has an end in all”(2.1.125). When false friends“fall away / Like water from ye”(2.1.130–1), his lament only confirms God’sagency and the efficacy of the psalmist’s prayer: let the wicked“melt away aswaters which run continually”(Psalm58:7). The recurrent echoing of thePsalms clearly has a purpose. Wolsey, for all his wickedness, is made toarticulate the same kind of truth in a similar way. Having inexplicablyrecovered a“still and quiet conscience,”with only his robe and“integrity toheaven”to call his own, his most famous lines are made to answer thepsalmist’s prayer,“Cast me not away in time of age”(Psalm71:9):“Had Iserved my God with half the zeal / I served my King, He would not in mineage / Have left me naked to my enemies”(3.2.381,453–8). While Cranmer atthe height of his ordeal, like Buckingham and Wolsey, is stripped of hisdignity and made“but a private man again”(5.2.89), the nakedness of QueenKatherine is evident in the way her trial is made to imitate the suffering of Job.She stands before the King“a most poor woman”and demands of him,“Inwhat have I offended you”that you should“take your good grace from me?”(2.4.13,16–20). Like Job, she is a servant without blemish,“lost among ye,laughed at, scorned”(3.1.106), but at the height of her persecution by her“counselors,”Wolsey and Cardinal Campeius, at the height of their attemptto persuade her to deny the truth and acknowledge the incestuous, illegalnature of her marriage to the King, she remains immovable and remembersPsalm7:8,“The Lord shall judge the people,”and, even more poignantly, Job19:25,“I know my redeemer liveth”:“Is this your Christian counsel?”Katherine demands of her self-styled friends,“Out upon ye! / Heaven isabove all yet; there sits a judge,”avindicator,that“no king can corrupt”(3.1.98–100). The insistent presence of the Psalms in the play seems to suggestthat history is only there to illustrate Scripture. And Scripture is therethroughout the play.The most difficult part of England’s chronicle history the play strugglesto represent in terms of God’s truth, perhaps not entirely successfully, is theKing’s motivation in precipitating his tragic divorce from QueenKatherine.26The problem English Protestants have to deal with is that26For more onHenry VIII’s depiction of Henry’s motives for divorcing Katherine, seeChapter13below.Hamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion245"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"the immediate occasion of the Church of England’s Reformation is therelationship between Henry and Anne Boleyn. If the play’s four stories of“mightiness meeting misery”focus on the limits of human agency, then thecentral story of Henry and Anne reveals the unlimited, intensely activepower of God’s agency, that is, the sheer force by which his grace moves inmysterious ways, utterly indifferent to human plans and designs. The playallows the world’s cynical view of their relationship full scope. Slanderflourishes (2.1.153–4); malice in the form of Wolsey, so rumor tells us,possesses the King“with a scruple”(2.1.156–8); and the pricking of theKing’s conscience, so Suffolk claims, is entirely a matter of sexual desire: it’snot so much that“marriage with his brother’s wife / Has crept too near hisconscience,”he tells us, but that his conscience has“crept too near anotherlady”(2.2.15–17). Even the King himself keeps confusing his tender con-science with tender bedfellows (2.2.140–3). This worldly view is exacerbatedby the way the play alters its source in Holinshed and has Henry meet Annebefore the divorce proceedings begin. But there is a countervailing narrativewhich, far from denying the sexuality of the King’s desire, struggles totransume it. Against this cloud of unfaithful witnesses, the play insists onAnne’s innocence. Anne’s cynical and salacious fellow lady-in-waiting, theold Lady, inadvertently identifies Anne’s virtue with that of the Queen:Anne is corrupt, she claims, because every“woman’s heart”is venal, drawnto“eminence, wealth,”and“sovereignty”(2.3.28–9). But the example of theQueen gives the lie to this self-serving generalization and intimates that inAnne’s feelings for the Queen and contempt for the old Lady she may bemade of sterner stuff, indeed the same stuffas the Queen:“Good Lady,”shesays to her venom-mouthed companion,“Make yourself mirth with yourparticular fancy,”but“leave me out on’t”(2.3.101–3). In her compassionand modesty, her“beauty and honour,”however tragic and confused thehistorical circumstances, Anne is made to appear afitting successor toKatherine–“a gem / To lighten all this isle”(2.3.75–9). Similarly, highlysexualized as the context of the King’s conversion narrative remains, noth-ing quite prepares us for its force.As Henry tells the story, his conversion originates in the marriagenegotiations for his daughter Mary, a conversation which appears to pre-date his meeting with Anne. It overtakes him like a tempest: it“shook / Thebosom of my conscience, entered me, / Yea, with a spitting power, andmade to tremble / The region of my breast”(2.4.178–81). The language isthat ofspiritus, the breath of God, the central metaphor of Scripture fromthe divine wind of Genesis (1:2) to the“rushing mighty wind”of thePentecost (Acts2:2). In the play, it is the same tempest that sweeps away246Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"the earthly glory of the Field of Cloth of Gold, the“hideous storm”thatshreds the false“garment of this peace”(1.1.89–94). If the King’s very realdesire for Anne is not denied, it appears to be co-opted and made merely apart of God’s design. The King begins his narrative by offering to defendWolsey against the rumor accepted as fact by the Queen that he hadinitiated and encouraged the divorce. The King would justify him–“willyou be further justified”(2.4.159)? In this, the King touches on one of themost sensitive terms of the Reformation. Justification by faith alone meansthat in justifying God or believing in his justice, we justify ourselves.27Sohere, in denying the world’s truth and offering Wolsey the“grace of truth,”the King’s confessional speech act seems designed to realize the descent ofgrace it describes. As in any classic Protestant conversion narrative, the Kingis moved by the Word, the breath of God unexpectedly manifesting itself inthe very human words of the Bishop of Bayonne, for the Bishop’s suspicionthat Henry had married“our brother’s wife”(2.4.178) raises the horror ofLeviticus20:21:“And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an uncleanthing: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall bechildless.”Overwhelmed by the tempest which these words constitute,the King suddenly comes to understand the reason for his lack of a maleheir, to see a truth whose“sharp thorny points”(2.4.221) make him“reek”under their oppression; they overrule his will and so drive the play’sre-presentation of English history forward to its climax.God shall be truly knownThere is, of course, no way of being absolutely sure of either Anne’sinnocence or the King’s integrity–it requires some kind of faith, specificallythe suspension of disbelief that the play’s ending encourages its audience tomake. The play’s ending, the longed-for birth and baptism of a child,England’s“sacred”Queen Elizabeth, throws everything else into perspec-tive.“Let me speak, sir,”says Cranmer,“For heaven now bids me, and thewords I utter / Let none thinkflattery, for they’llfind’em truth”(5.4.14–16).They willfind them“truth”because Cranmer’s future is the audience’spresent and in the festival mood of early1613London, England’s presentpeace and prosperity is meant to confirm the substance of the Archbishop’sact of faith.

Out of England’stroubled past, the King’s great matter and the sexually ambiguous nature ofhis conversion, the divorce and the Job-like suffering of the old Queen,comes regeneration–a new queen, one whose fruitful promise is realized inthe greater glory of her daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth and inElizabeth’s own“star-like”male successor, the present king. Henry VIIIfinally has his son.“God shall be truly known”(5.4.35), says Cranmer, andknown in the providential history of the nation, because in the root ofAnne, in the maturing of the Elizabethan settlement, England has come torealize the peace and prosperity of the Davidic kingdom, the biblical age soidealized by the Church of England’s early seventeenth-century divinesfrom Hooker to Lancelot Andrewes–those divines who will eventuallycome to be seen as the creators of a specifically“Anglican”church, divineswhom Joseph Hall calls the“wonder of the world”as he addressed thefloscleri Anglicaniat St. Paul’sin1624.28It is Protestant England as thisfirstUnited Kingdom, the realm of David and Solomon, that the play iscelebrating, not the militant or apocalyptic radicalism of those who stillrestlessly seek, in Hooker’s derisory words, to further“the Lord’s disci-pline.”29Queen Elizabeth fulfills the promise of1Kings4:25,“And Judahand Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under hisfig tree, fromDan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon,”for“In her days everyman shall eat in safety / Under his own vine what he plants and sing / Themerry songs of peace to all his neighbours”(5.4.32–5). Similarly, King Jamesfulfills the promise of Psalm92:11–12,“The righteous shallflourish like thepalm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that are planted inthe house of the Lord shallflourish in the courts of God,”for the King“shallflourish / And like a mountain cedar reach his branches / To all the plainsabout him.”The present audience, the audience of1613, our“children’schildren,”shall“see this and bless heaven”(5.4.52–5). It is too easy tooveremphasize the political and dismiss all this as theflattery Cranmerfears it might be taken for–mere performance orersatzreligion in theservice of royal propaganda. It is too easy because what the ending strives tothrow into relief more than anything else is not the human agency of greatprinces or even heroic individuals but a universal truth, in this case God’s28Hall is quoted from Patrick Collinson,The Religion of Protestants: The Church in English Society,1559–1625(Oxford: Clarendon Press,1982), p.92.

For this reason, the King’s historical desirefor Anne is represented as a story of prevenient grace, and his closing rescueof Cranmer isfigured as an act of royal subjection:“if a prince / May bebeholden to a subject,”Henry confesses,“I / Am for his love and service soto him”(5.2.189–91). That is, out of his love I have become a subject to myservant. Monarchy is justified as a conduit or function of grace. It is thisrecurrent abnegation of independent human understanding and agencythat appears so disappointing and alien to Bloom and his sense of what itmeans to be human. As the play’s epilogue suggests, the example of thesaintly Queen Katherine is especially important in establishing its centrality.When she comes to her end, she appears for a moment like Hamletdetermined to set it down and remember Wolsey’s unspeakable guilt, his“unbounded stomach”(4.2.34). But checked by her lowly servant, her“honest chronicler,”Griffiths, she comes to acknowledge the cardinal’svirtues and so bless her enemy:“Whom I most hated living, thou hastmade me, / With thy religious truth and modesty, / Now in his ashes,honour. Peace be with him”(4.2.72–5). And then, ironically invokingPatience, the virtue as much as her actual lady-in-waiting, she says,“Patience, be near me still and set me lower”(4.2.76). It is out of thisexample of abnegation or stillness, of humility or being set lower, that theplaywrights seem to imagine that their ceremonial history will succeed: ifthe good women in the audience will show pity, imitate the grace or“merciful construction”of the Queen (epilogue10), then so will all“thebest men”(13) and with that the play will have its desired effect. It isultimately out of this God-given surplus that the“wonders”(5.4.55)ofboth Cranmer’s prophecy and the play itself will be realized. Howeveranticlimactic and weak the metatheatrical epilogue is, the play itself isnot. And it is the seriousness with which it strives to reorder and so tran-scend what Alain Badiou would call the“facticity”of history, the intractablecontingency of this history in particular, that makes the difference.3030Badiou,Saint Paul,p.45.Hamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion249"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"It is as if the play were rerooting the theater’s secular exploitation of theChristian doctrine of grace, so evident in Shakespeare’s late romances, backinto a religious understanding of the recent past. Who would have thoughtthat out of so many stories of confusion and failure, there should emergesuch peace and prosperity? History is made to transform the credulity offictional characters likeThe Tempest’s Gonzalo into something substantialby showing how the relation between past and present confirms the efficacyof faith, providing a very real“assurance of things hoped for”(Hebrews11:1).In this, it argues for the presence of God in the world; it offers a perceptionof transcendence, the whole action of the play turning on a sense of theuniverse being, in Charles Taylor’s terms,“porous”or open to the divine. Inthis sacralizing drama, this specifically proto-Anglican play, that openness,it needs to be emphasized, is not imagined in terms of magic or Taylor’s“enchantment”but in terms of Scripture, and Scripture often inflectedthrough memories of the liturgy. Liturgy is as important as it is becauseeven for so many Protestants committed to the principle ofsola scriptura,“spiritual life,”as Brian Cummings suggests, still needs to“find an expres-sion in bodily performance”(Common Prayer,p.750). That is, the liturgyenables the believer to perform his or her relation to the transcendence ofthe Word in Communion or as part of a public community.31The sacra-ments celebrated in the liturgy, says Hooker, are“heavenlie ceremonies”ordained as outward shows or“markes whereby to knowe when God dothimparte the vitall or saving grace of Christ.”32Henry VIIIis as muchShakespeare’s play as Fletcher’s, but the critical influence in its liturgicalturn may well have been that of the late Bishop of London’s son.The coronation of Queen Anne and the liturgyof the Prayer BookJohn Fletcher was born into a distinguished ecclesiastical family, his grand-father Richard becoming Vicar of Cranbrook in Kent in1561, and his father(also Richard) rising to much greater eminence as the Bishop of London inJanuary1595.33Over the course of the later sixteenth century the careers of31On the relation between ceremony and community, see Achsah Guibbory,Ceremony and Communityfrom Herbert to Milton(Cambridge University Press,1998), esp. pp.11–43.32Hooker,Lawsv.57(vol.ii,p.245).33During his time at Cambridge, Fletcher the dramatist seems to have been destined for the ministry. In1593he became a Bible clerk at his college, Corpus Christi, and as such his principal task was to readthe lessons at divine service. Two points seem especially significant about Fletcher’s religious back-ground. First, his father’s career anticipates the pattern of“mightiness meeting misery”so evident inthe play. In other words, its theme comes close to home, and it is hard to imagine Fletcher not250Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Fletcher’s father and grandfather epitomize the progress of many EnglishProtestants from what Patrick Collinson calls“primitive Protestantism”towards“a kind of Anglicanism.”34At the heart of this proto-Anglicanism, no matter how radical individual members might be indoctrine, was an enduring commitment to the liturgy of ThomasCranmer’s Book of Common Prayer.The purpose of the liturgy, like that of the play’s“chosen truth,”is, as thereal Cranmer says in his1549preface to the Prayer Book, the“advaunce-ment of godliness”(p.4), that God should be truly known. The liturgyshould be so ordered that“the whole Bible (or greatest part thereof) shouldbe read over once in the yeare”(p.4). The Psalms, in particular, should notbe divided up, some read and some“utterly omitted”(p.4), but so orderedthat all one hundred andfifty of them could be heard over the course of eachmonth at Matins and Evensong. Most importantly, the liturgy should beperformed in such a way that it would have anaffectiveimpact. Both clergyand the people should feel moved: the clergy should be“stirred up togodliness”and the people“inflamed with the love of his true religion”(p.4). The liturgy will effect this by dramatizing or performing Scripture. IfShakespeare and Fletcher’s play has an obvious ceremonial quality, thenequally, the ceremony of the liturgy has a strong theatrical bias. TheBook ofCommon Prayer, says Cummings, is a“performative book, more like a play-text than like a novel in the way we must approach it as readers,”its variousrubrics functioning“a little like the stage-directions in a Shakespeare play”(Prayer Book, p. xxxiv).“Then the Priest turnyng hym to the Altar, shall sayeor syng, playnly and distinctly, this prayer folowynge”(p.29), reads a typicalrubric. In performing this prayer, he becomes its living embodiment. At thesame time, Cranmer is acutely aware of the dangers of performance: heknows full well that“no ordre can be so perfectly devised”that for some, outof“ignoraunce and infermitie, or els of malice and obstinacie,”it will notbe“misconstrued, depraved, and interpreted in a wrong part”(p.667). Heis therefore careful to reduce the contingency of performance by givingprecise instructions on how prayers, readings, and ceremonies are both to becarried out and, in some cases, how exactly they are to be understood. Aboveremembering his father’s fall as he worked onHenry VIII. Within two months of becoming Bishop ofLondon, Richard Fletcher fell out of favor with Queen Elizabeth for marrying a second wife. He wasbanished from the Queen’s presence and only reluctantly allowed to continue in office. But he borehis disgrace with patience and over the course of a year wasfinally forgiven just before his death inJune1596. See Brett Usher,“Richard Fletcher,”ODNB.34Patrick Collinson,“Cranbrook and the Fletchers: Popular and Unpopular Religion in the KentishWeald,”inGodly People: Essays on English Protestantism and Puritanism(London: Hambledon Press,1983), pp.399–428(p.422).Hamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion251"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"all, he is concerned, just as the play is, that performance in articulatingGod’s truth should not be divisive; it should produce peace and reconcilia-tion,“a godly unitie”(p.19), avoiding“all matters and occasyon of dyscen-sion”(p.38). Just as in the play, thefictional Cranmer and his Catholicenemy, Gardiner, are made to embrace and bless each with“a true heart /And brother-love”(5.3.205–6), so in the Prayer Book the real Cranmerstruggles over and over again to reconcile the sensitivities of old and newwith“brotherly charitie”(p.667). My point is that the spirit of the liturgy,howeverfitfully, animates the play. The performance of Holy Communionin the Prayer Book is especially sensitive, and although quite different in itsimmediate significance, something of its form and pressure is evident in oneof the play’s ceremonial high points, its representation of Queen Anne’scoronation.What is striking about Cranmer’s rubrics is that although the main aim ofthe Prayer Book is to foreground the Word, enormous attention is still paidto ceremony. The most contentious issue in the ceremony of Communionis that of kneeling to receive the bread and wine. In1552, in response to theobjections of the Scots minister John Knox, Cranmer added a long para-graph to the Prayer Book known as“the Black Rubric”to avoid dissensionand explain exactly what was to be understood by kneeling. It is not an actof adoration, he declares–there is no question of transubstantiation, ofworshipping either“the Sacramentall bread or wyne there bodily received”or“anye reall and essential presence there beeying of Christes naturallflesheand bloude”(p.667). It is an act of reverence, signifying“the humble andgratefull acknowledging of the benefites of Chryst”(p.667). In kneeling,communicants are meant to act out and so formally realize the reception ofthe grace made possible through Christ’s sacrifice, the implication beingthat ceremony, Cranmer says, stirs up the mind and edifies the participantby“some notable and special signification”(p.215). Spiritual life needs tofind expression in bodily performance. At the climax of the play’s repre-sentation of the coronation of Queen Anne, there is a similar emphasis onkneeling.As the chorus of gentlemen makes clear, the public occasion of theQueen’s coronation is meant to counterpoint that of Buckingham’s trial:if“that time offered sorrow,”then this offers“general joy”(4.1.6–7). Out ofthat sorrow comes a happiness that was utterly unforeseen. As the highpoint of the trial is Buckingham’s gracious speech act, so the high point ofthe coronation is the new Queen’s gracious act of communion. After theelaborate procession to Westminster Abbey is formally enacted on stage, thecoronation itself is described at third hand by a third gentleman whose only252Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"appearance in the play this is. His emphasis falls on the relation between theQueen and the people,first the fruitfulness of their union and then some-thing else. The King is entirely absent and she bears his sovereignty in herown right.35Having entered the Abbey, so we are told,“her grace sat down”on a chair of royal state opening or“opposing freely / The beauty of herperson to the people”(4.1.67–70). Their reaction is electric: the free-flowingand regenerative force of“her grace”is registered in the noise the peoplemake–the rushing sound of“a stifftempest”:“Great-bellied women”shakeand everyone, men and their wives, all are“woven / So strangely in onepiece”(4.1.74,78–83). The Queen and her people have become one. Butthis highly sexualized, metaphoric communion is immediately transmutedinto something different. At its climax she turns to God and kneels:At length her grace rose, and with modest pacesCame to the altar, where she kneeled and saint-likeCast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly.(4.1.84–6)At this moment, so the kneeling suggests, she redirects the affect of thepeople to God; they are incorporated with her in“a humble and gratefullacknowledging of the benfytes of Chryst”(Prayer Book,p.667). Before sheisfinally crowned by Cranmer, before receiving the symbols of sovereignty,she subjects herself to the people: then she“rose again and bowed her to thepeople”(4.1.87). Monarchy is certainly being idealized, but only as it isimagined in the Prayer Book, as a conduit for and very much subject toGod’s grace:“Almightie and everlasting God,”the coronation audiencemight have prayed,“wee bee taught by thy holy worde, that the heartes ofKynges are in thy rule and governaunce, and that thou doest dispose, andturne them as it semeth best to thy godly wisedom: We humbly besechethee, so to dispose and governe”this, the heart of our new Queen (PrayerBook,p.21). Let her be moved by the grace of God’s truth.How effective the immediate impact of the play was is not clear.Although records before1660are inadequate and despite Wotton’s dubioustestimony, it seems to have enjoyed increasing success.36The success of theplay continued throughout the eighteenth century and Jane Austen wasclearly influenced by the increasing focus on Queen Katherine and herinternal sufferings. Actresses like Mary Porter, for instance, worked hard tointensify the effect of the character’s inwardness:“the suppression of her35The King was not entirely absent for the historical ceremony of June1,1533, but observed from aspecially erected gallery.

Like John Fletcher, Jane Austenwas also the child of an Anglican clergyman, and her response to the playbrings me to the heart of my argument.Mansfield Parkand the stillness of Queen KatherineAusten clearly loved the play and she gives it a prominent role in her greatnovelMansfield Park(1814). Her choice of a play about Henry VIII is mostobviously a joke at the expense of the novel’s own inconstant Henry, HenryCrawford. More importantly, however, the play becomes the occasion of ananimated discussion about how to improve both the understanding andaffective impact of the Church of England’s liturgy. The discussion is deeplyironic. The novel’s central character, the modest but perceptive FannyPrice, has been readingHenry VIIIto her less than acute aunt, LadyBertram. When they hear Fanny’s persistent suitor, Crawford, and hercousin, Edmund Bertram, approaching, Fanny nervously breaks off.Crawford picks up the book and continues the reading, playing all theroles, lighting“with the happiest knack”on“the best scene, or the bestspeeches of each”(pp.334–5). His performance is mesmerizing. Even thereluctant Fanny is captivated, and Edmund, a newly ordained minister, isinspired to consider how the“distinctness and energy”of such a dramaticreading might be applied to the liturgy–how it might“have weight inrecommending the most solid truths”(p.337). Crawford concurs:“Ourliturgy has beauties which not even a careless, slovenly style of reading candestroy; but it has also redundancies and repetitions, which require goodreading [if they are] not to be felt [as such]”(pp.337–8). The irony, to whichonly the sensitive Fanny seems privy, is that the actorly Crawford is far moreinterested in the performance than the significance of either the play or theliturgy. While neither the value of dramatizing the liturgy nor sacralizingdrama in plays likeHenry VIIIis in doubt, Crawford’s constancy is. In hisconsummate acting skills and irrepressible delight in performance, in hisrestless self-fashioning, he is a caricature of rootless, autonomous agency: as37Quotedibid., p.49.254Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Fanny had noticed much earlier, he“was every thing to every body, andseemed tofind no one essential to him [self]”(p.309). Unlike Crawford,Fanny“lights”on nothing. When Edmund and Crawford interrupt her andLady Bertram, she has been reading one particular speech, Wolsey’s greatact of remorse. Hisfinal, gracious act of faith is not a matter of“sweatytranscendence”; it has had a profound impact on both her and her aunt. Ithas calmed Fanny, and when Edmund and Crawford enter both ladiesappear to be in a state of“deep tranquility”(p.334). Fanny had only got tothe middle of the Cardinal’s speech, but she may well have ended on thisexhortation:“Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace / To silence envioustongues. Be just, and fear not”(3.2.446–7). Here at his end Wolsey speaksout of the wisdom of Queen Katherine, immovable in her righteousness,and the mystery of Jane Austen’s least popular heroine is that she exempli-fies the“still and quiet conscience”(3.2.381) that Wolsey attains only at theend of his life and to which the playHenry VIIIconstantly returns. AsQueen Katherine remembers Job and the Psalms, so Fanny remembers theplay and remains immovable in her discriminating sense of what the truthis. Early in the novel this stillness, the particular way of being in the worldthat protects Fanny from the unmoored agency of players like Crawford, islocated in the chapel at Mr. Rushworth’s great house at Sotherton.The chapel is immediately distinguished for its simplicity. It was“a mere,spacious, oblong roomfitted up for the purpose of devotion”(p.114), aplace where“silence and stillness reigned in it with few interruptionsthroughout the year”(p.117). Like the Protestantism of the Church ofEngland itself, the chapel negotiates a middle way between what Austenmight imagine to be extremes of religious practice, between RomanCatholicism, on the one hand, and religious individualism, on the other.The chapel seems to have been conceived as a place of refuge during thereign of England’s last, aggressively Catholic king, James II, a holy placewhere the Rushworth household could worship in peace as a community–not as individuals in their closets but at the same time away from the parishchurch.“It is a handsome chapel,”says Mrs. Rushworth,“and was formerlyin constant use both morning and evening. Prayers were always read in it bythe domestic chaplain, within the memory of many. But the lateMr. Rushworth left it off”(p.115). Crawford’s sister, the quick but worldlyMary, misses the elegiac tone:“Every generation has its improvements,”sheresponds tartly. But Fanny sees the point and immediately seizes on theliturgical ideal Mrs. Rushworth’s remarks intimate:“There is something ina chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house, with one’sideas of what such a household should be! A whole family assembling for theHamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion255"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"purpose of prayer, isfine!”(p.115). In response to Mary’s continuedskepticism, Edmund joins Fanny in defending the value of communalworship, emphasizing entirely in the spirit of the Book of CommonPrayer the singular value“of place and example”in avoiding distractionand rousing“better feelings”(p.116). In Evelyn Waugh’sBridesheadRevisited(1945), the chapel at Sotherton is appropriated for RomanCatholicism. While both texts are concerned with Charles Taylor’s tran-scendence, what the particular stillness of the two chapels signifies is quitedifferent. At Brideshead, it simply means emptiness. That is, unless thepresence of the Holy Spirit is made manifest in the sanctuary lamp, thechapel’s stillness only evokes the desolation of the Book of Lamentations:Quomodo sedet sola civitas–“How doth the city sit solitary”(Lamentions1:1).38At Sotherton, however, stillness,“deep tranquility”or“gentle peace,”is of intrinsic value; it doesn’t stand in opposition to, but welcomes thesound of prayers“both morning and evening,”in the liturgy of Matins andEvensong. When read through the novel’s relation toHenry VIII, Fanny’sstillness reveals its specifically religious roots in the drama of Buckingham,Queen Katherine, Wolsey, and Cranmer. It is true that when read throughsuch bewilderingly different perspectives as the Crawfords’vitality, thePrices’poverty, or, most disturbingly, the slavery on which the prosperityof Mansfield Park itself rests, Fanny’s stillness might look, at the very least,like complacency, but when read throughHenry VIIIit suggests a discoursenotnecessarilyat odds with any of these perspectives: a discourse consumedwith the desire for the kind of truth–“that principle of right,”“that justconsideration of others, that knowledge of [one’s] own heart”(p.119)–which might resist the erosion of value and anchor all moral relations. Inthis, her stillness points to the way the Bible’s wisdom literature, especiallyJob and the Psalms, sustains Shakespeare and Fletcher’s characters.“Standin awe, and sin not,”says Psalm4:4,“commune with your own heart...and be still.”Tanner senses this dimension of the novel when he concludesthat Fanny“suffers in her stillness. For righteousness sake”(p.32). In this,says the novel, she“should be justified”(p.438).39For Harold Bloom, and of course for most of us,Hamletremains at thecenter of our profoundly relativistic, skeptical culture: however embeddedthe play is, in fact, in seventeenth-century religious culture, it is difficult notto feel its secular power, its ability to tell us who we are and what it means to38See Evelyn Waugh,Brideshead Revisited(Harmondsworth: Penguin,2000), p.225, where the themeofQuomodo sedet sola civitasfirst begins to be articulated.39For more on Shakespearean drama and biblical wisdom literature, seeChapter10above.256Paul Stevens"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"be human. It is part of our“constitution,”as Henry Crawford might put it(p.335)–not just an Englishman’s, but any secular person’s.40Henry VIIIismuch harder to appreciate. What I have been trying to suggest is not simplythat the play is a sacralizing drama, something more than the“the rags andbones”of a religious culture reassembled to please a secular crowd, but asubject for postsecular inquiry. For the play models a different way of beingin the world–most importantly, a different way of being human from theone Bloom claims Shakespeare invented in his plays. It idealizes a truthbeyond relativism; when read in relation to the much laterMansfield Park,itpoints not necessarily to religion itself but to what Alain Badiou calls the“transcendent neutrality”of the universal. Queen Katherine and herdescendant, Fanny Price, are no less capable of inwardness or self-reflectionthan the Prince, but they exemplify something more than Bloom’s self-regarding worship of our own“all-but-infinite consciousness.”They exem-plify a way of being whose goodness does not depend on the endlessidealization of human agency and our instrumental reason, but rather ona universal or truth, a transcendent signified, which with all its difficultiesmight enable us to go beyond our selves.40See Stephen Greenblatt,“Racial Memory and Literary History,”PMLA,116(2001), esp.50–1, for acharacteristically stimulating but also nationalist, American reading of this passage.Hamlet, Henry VIII, and the question of religion257"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"chapter 13Converting Henry: truth, history, and historicalfaith inHenry VIIIMichael DaviesIMy consciencefirst received a tenderness,Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utteredBy th’Bishop of Bayonne, then French Ambassador,Who had been hither sent on the debatingA marriage’twixt the Duke of Orleans andOur daughter Mary.

They lay bare (or so it might seem) the political and religiousconvictions behind Henry’s decision to end his marriage of twenty years toKatherine of Aragon, his“Sometimes...brother’s [i.e., Arthur’s] wife”(2.4.178). This dramatic moment would lead historically to the fall ofWolsey, the break with Rome, and the Great Supremacy, the legislationfor which established Henry VIII as Supreme Head of the Church ofEngland, thereby instituting a much grander historical narrative: that ofthe English Reformations.4So much is obvious.

Such experience is defined authentically, it seems,by the vicissitudes encountered by godly converts amid“flouds of tempta-tion”that can easily“over-whelme the poore distressed, doubting, despair-ing and drowning soule.”8Like John Bunyan, another, later English convertwhose“castings down, and raisings up”amid his own inward storms arerecollected inGrace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners(1666), Shakespeare’sHenryfinds himself“mazed”by a painful conviction that he stands nolonger“in the smile of heaven.”95Henry VIIIis often regarded as devoid of anything specifically“Protestant”: see, for example, Cespedes,“Sense of History,”414; Brietz Monta,“Polemics of Conscience,”276; Frederick O.

On the one hand this is a tradition that connects Henry’ssuffering and its sudden“spitting power”to that most archetypal of con-versions, Paul’s on the road to Damascus, while on the other it centers him inthe language of“new birth.”10When Henry confesses to suffering from a“groaning throe”brought on by his newly burdened conscience, this allusionto the pangs of pregnancy may signal a crisis over the king’s“manliness,”asGordon McMullan has argued.11Yet it also testifies, perhaps more directly, tohis laboring or“travailing”in an implied spiritual rebirth. Such Protestant“experience”would not have been beyond Shakespeare’sreach.Intheirpopular tracts and sermons, Calvinist divines since at least the1580shadbeen extolling the virtues of a practical piety that would focus on individualrepentance and personal reformation as a means of national conversiontowards godliness and“amendment of life.”12“The power of grace dothbeget in a regenerate man, a watchfulnesse, care and conscience of smalleroffences, of secret sins, of sinfull thoughts”and“of all occasions of sinne,”Robert Bolton would advise inA Discourse on the State of True Happiness(1611),“whereas the formall hypocrite...makes no conscience of them at all,holding it a point of precisenes to be too conscionable.”13In this context,Shakespeare’s conscience-bound Henry VIII seems to step forward in2.4asan ideal witness to the Protestant“power of grace,”as Bolton puts it. Hiswords appear to epitomize how“the soule of Gods child, comming fresh outof the pangs and terrors of his new-birth”is humbled“under the mightiehand of God, by a sight and sense of his sinnes.”14As the Protestant pun thatintroduces Henry’s confession at the beginning of his speech indicates, in thisway will the king be“justified”(2.4.159).There is, of course, a significant obstacle to accepting this presentation ofHenry VIII in terms of what G. Wilson Knight has described as the play’s10On Paul’s conversion as a Reformation“archetype”(and“anti-type”), see Brian Cummings,TheLiterary Culture of the Reformation(Oxford University Press,2007), pp.366–72,388–9.11Gordon McMullan,“‘Thou hast made me now a man’: Reforming Man(ner)liness in Henry VIII,”inJennifer Richards and James Knowles (eds.),Shakespeare’s Late Plays: New Readings(EdinburghUniversity Press,1999), pp.44–6.12Dewey D.

And would he have spoken these words?Yet, even if he had, would that make them“true”in the sense of genuineand sincere? Are we really to believe, in other words, that Shakespeare’sHenry VIII is motivated to seek a divorce because of a sharp“prick”in his“conscience”? Or were Henry’s marital misgivings spurred by a ratherdifferent kind of“prick”: that is, by“the historical reality of Henry’s sexual,corporeal desire for Anne [Boleyn]”?

In which version of“history”are we to put our faith? The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate not onlyhow natural it is for us to ask such questions ofHenry VIII, but also howimperative it is for us to do so. How we see Shakespeare’s Henry–whetheras God-fearing man and proto-Protestant monarch, or as nascent tyrant andphilandering crook–may be determined, to a large degree, by whether webelieve he is speaking the truth in Act2, scene4. How we receive Henry’swords about his conversion is key in this respect. Our reaction to them maywell shape–as it has done for so many of the play’s critics and commenta-tors–whether we see the play as sympathetic or cynical towards Henry, andindeed whether the drama betrays a denominational bias in its historiog-raphy; that is, whetherHenry VIIIpresents the king in a way that could bethought of as either“Catholic”or“Protestant.”18The fact thatHenry VIII15Wilson Knight,Crown of Life,p.282.16OnAll Is Trueas the play’s original title, see Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor,William Shakespeare: ATextual Companion(Oxford University Press,1987), pp.28,618–19.17Thomas Betteridge,“Henry VIII and Popular Culture,”in Mark Rankin et al.

It does so, however, even while encouraging us toquestion and ultimately to abandon what early modern reformers andProtestants referred to as a“historical faith”in the events selectively dram-atized within it. It is in recognizing the play’s immersion in some distinctlyearly modern Protestant ways of thinking about Henry’s Reformation, andespecially its mistrust of any faith in past events that may be termed merely“historical,”that we can see howHenry VIIIpresents the“truth”of its“history”as unfixed and unstable, perhaps even untrue. It does so, more-over, while asserting throughout that what is being staged before our eyesnevertheless is, as the prologue reinforces,“All...True.”To establish howthe play works in such paradoxical and indeed startlingly experimentalterms, we need to look again at the King’s speech in2.4–the historyShakespeare’s work”produced entirely by Fletcher (Shadowplay[New York: PublicAffairs,2005],pp.276–8).

As numerous commentators have noted, the play appears to be attimes little more than“Holinshed versified.”25Act2, scene4is one of thosetimes. When Henry offers his reasons for questioning the legitimacy of hismarriage, we might be pressed to accept it as“true”partly because of thecloseness with which Shakespeare follows almost word-for-word the corre-sponding passage in the1587Chronicles: with its story of the“Bishop ofBaion”and the query raised over Mary’s legitimacy; its sense of“Godsindignation”being suddenly“conceived within the secret bottome”ofHenry’s soul; and its memorable image too of the King’s“conscience”being“tossed in the waves of a scrupulous mind.”26The result is a playthat becomes almost obsessively punctilious about conveying historical“truth”by remaining, in certain places, doggedly faithful to the“letter”ofhistory, or at least to Holinshed’s well-known version of it.The“spirit”of this dramatic method and of the history that it purports tolay before us is more difficult to fathom. Although the structure and contentof Henry’s speech in2.4mirror almost exactly those of the1587Chronicles,any notion that it presents an incontestable or unitary“truth”can bechallenged by the smallest of our historical doubts. In this instance, a simplebut significant problem arises from the fact that in Holinshed, and thus tooin2.4ofHenry VIII, Henry’s reference to the Bishop of Bayonne is23See Geoffrey Bullough (ed.),Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare,8vols.

The bishop in question would havebeen Gabriel de Grammont, bishop of Tarbes, who led the French embassyon this occasion in1527, not Jean du Bellay, bishop of Bayonne.27Such anerror may appear to be entirely harmless, of course, but it can also serve toinvite a certain skepticism towards the trustworthiness of the history beingpresented. J. J. Scarisbrick, Tudor historian and preeminent biographer ofHenry VIII, is in fact deeply dubious about the whole story of thisconjugally inquisitive bishop, as recounted by Henry at Blackfriars in1529:“It is incredible that an ambassador would have dared to trespassupon so delicate a subject as a monarch’s marriage,”he notes,“least of allwhen he had come to negotiate a treaty with that monarch”(in this caseover Mary’s marriage to the Duke of Orleans).28Aside from the arrival ofthe Bishop of Tarbes in England in1527, which rules him out as the possibleprompter of Henry’s“scruple”(as the king was already taking steps toprosecute the divorce by that point), Scarisbrick adds that“another accountof the beginnings of the story, given by Henry in1528, says that doubtsabout Mary’s legitimacy werefirst put by the French to English ambassa-dors in France–not by the bishop of Tarbes to his English hosts.”29Henry either makes a mistake in referring to the Bishop of Bayonne in his“scruple”speech, as it is reported (or perhaps misreported?) in Holinshed(and then subsequently dramatized inHenry VIII); or, as Scarisbrick seemsto be implying, the King was fabricating the entire thing. It might beobjected, of course, that few audience members in either1613or todaywould actually recognize this historical error over which bishop did what toset Henry on the course of his conscientious conversion. Yet we could stillwonder, as Scarisbrick does, how any experienced ambassador could dropsuch a resounding clanger before a king with whom he is attempting tobroker a diplomatic deal. We would not need to be that well versed in theminutiae of Tudor history to sense that something about Henry’s story failsto ring true in this respect. Yet, still, why should such things matter? Whyshould we care? If Bohemia can develop a conveniently fatal coastline inTheWinter’s Tale, then surely we should be able to accommodate inHenry VIIIsome small discrepancy over which bishop said what to the King, even in a27George Cavendish,The Life and Death of Cardinal Wolsey, ed.

For if the detail about the Bishop of Bayonne indicates even theslightestflicker of unreliability or falsehood on either Henry’s or Holinshed’spart, then the entire integrity of Henry’s confession at Blackfriars in1529(dramatized so faithfully in2.4) is called into question. As a result, we may notknow whether to take anything as“truthful”in this speech nor, more to thepoint, where to locate the source of Henry’s troubled“conscience.”If not in asincere conviction that his marriage has offended God, from whence mightHenry’s“scruple”be said, truthfully, to have its origin?The play itself seems to make it relatively easy to answer this question: inthe King’s desire for the eminently lustworthy Anne Boleyn. This is awoman whose physical presence in the play is marked by an attractivenessthat menfind simply irresistible: they are compelled to kiss Anne practicallyon sight inHenry VIII. Wherever she goes, charged sexual energies aredetonated into explosive moments of either bawdy punning or riotous, evenorgiastic festivity (none of which bodes well in hindsight, of course, giventhe charges that would lead to her execution).30As commentators have beenaware, it is because the play has Henry meet (and fall for) Anne in Act1,scene4, long before he declares anything about his“tender conscience,”thatit becomes hard for us to see the King’s confession in2.4(which, naturally,makes no mention of Anne) as sincere or truthful. As a result,“conscience,”even by2.4, becomes a troublingly sullied word inHenry VIII: shorthandfor the King’s sexual proclivities rather than his piety.31If read cynically,moreover, Henry’s words about“conscience”in2.4would confirm ascathingly skeptical view ofHenry VIIIoverall when it comes to its claimsabout“truth”because, as Frank Cespedes has argued, everything in the playappears to be“structured to...underline Henry’s hypocrisy.”32Henry’sspeech in2.4thus becomes symptomatic and paradigmatic in these terms. Itoffers an“unflattering”image of Henry, we might conclude, whose“erraticself-defense”on the basis of“conscience”evinces no more, as HughM. Richmond has put it, than his“own guilty awareness of his dishonorablemotives”and, indeed,“the appalling moral and political confusion intowhich he has betrayed himself.”3330See, e.g.,1.4,2.3,and4.1.42–83, for comments on which see Wilson Knight,Crown of Life, pp.303–4.31See Cespedes,“Sense of History,”425; Brietz Monta,“Polemics of Conscience,”275.32Cespedes,“Sense of History,”426.33H.

On the one hand,HenryVIIIappears to champion Katherine’s cause as a pious wife and loyal papistover and above Henry’s as a conscientious and heirless king, making theabandoned wife, mother, and queen the emotional focus of the play.35Onthe other, as Peter Rudnytsky has argued, its chronology appears to adhereto that of sixteenth-century“Catholic”histories of the divorce. Because“Henry’s desire for Anne arises before the bruiting of the rumor of hisdivorce,”Rudnytsky notes, then Shakespeare effectively“undermines theofficial version”of Henry’s alleged“motives”for the divorce. The reason forthe conspicuous“implausibility”of Henry’s“unconvincing”speech in2.4can now be explained quite easily: it is because“Shakespeare upholds aCatholicperspective on the divorce,”Rudnytsky posits, one that subverts“[t]he‘Protestant’reading of the play”by locating Henry’s“scruple”not ina wounded conscience but, more accurately, in the lust, greed, and villainythat are, in truth, at the root of this power-hungry king’s“true feelings.”36But can we be sure–historically speaking–that Henry VIII’s“scruple”was no more than a smoke-screen for baser, carnal desires, as is so oftenassumed? As Diarmaid MacCulloch has indicated, there may be goodreason for us to regard Henry’s words about“conscience”as sincere, makingit historically misguided, as Lacey Baldwin Smith likewise has argued,“toaccept politics and lust as the central motives behind the divorce.”37As aking who“took time offfrom the pleasures of hunting and war not only toread theology voraciously, but to write it,”MacCulloch argues, and whowould turn to“theological activity for comfort in successive great crises ofhis life,”Henry’s“efforts to rid himself of the Aragon marriage were fatallycomplicated from the beginning by his obstinate refusal to see the question34Beauregard,Catholic Theology,p.137.35The view that the play treats Katherine more sympathetically than any other character, fuelingspeculation that Shakespeare himself was a Catholic, has a long tradition:ibid., p.141; VelmaBourgeois Richmond,Shakespeare, Catholicism, and Romance(New York: Continuum,2000),pp.201–6.

If, for example, we were to share Scarisbrick’s skepticism aboutHenry’s“scruple”originating from a conversation with a French ambassa-dor when negotiating the marriage of Mary then, equally, we would have toadmit that we can never know the full truth of its genesis. Scarisbrickpragmatically proposes that“[i]t is very likely that Henry himself was theauthor of his doubts”about his marriage, rather than Wolsey or any otheradvisor-confessor, and that he“may have begun to entertain”them“as earlyas1522or1523.”42Others accept that“the precise origins of the divorceremain obscure”and that it is impossible to say whether Henry’s conscien-tious reasons for wanting to end hisfirst marriage were sincere or not.43AsHenry Angsar Kelly has put it succinctly,“Henry’s mind in the matter hasremained a mystery.”44It seems just as difficult for historians to determine the truth about whatmight otherwise seem the most obvious and well-known of“facts”aboutthe divorce and the beginnings of Henrician Reformation: the role playedby Anne Boleyn. Was the love (or lust) she inspired in Henry the propercause of it all? Perhaps not. According to Scarisbrick,“the scruple mayalready have acquiredfirm roots”in Henry’s mind long before“Anne38MacCulloch,“Reform of the Church,”pp.162–3.39Eric Ives,Anne Boleyn(Oxford: Blackwell,2004), p.84.40Smith,“Matter of Conscience,”pp.39,42–3.41MacCulloch,“Religion of Henry VIII,”p.160.42Scarisbrick,Henry VIII, pp.154,151–4.43Virginia Murphy,“The Literature and Propaganda of Henry VIII’s First Divorce,”in MacCulloch(ed.),Reign of Henry VIII, pp.135–58(p.135).44Henry Ansgar Kelly,The Matrimonial Trials of Henry VIII(Stanford University Press,1976), p.1.268Michael Davies"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Boleyn captured the king,”particularly as“the chronology of Anne’s rise isimpossible to discover exactly.”45Though afirm believer in the idea thatHenry’s“true reason”for divorcing Katherine“may well have been hispassion for Anne,”nevertheless G. W. Bernard admits that“precise andspecific information on the circumstances and the timing”of Anne’sappearance on Henry’s sexual radar“is hard tofind.”46Regardless ofuncertainties surrounding the“chronology”of Henry’s“advancing convic-tion”about the sinfulness of his marriage to Katherine, David Loades hasargued recently that“what is reasonably certain is that Anne Boleyn hadnothing to do with it”:“Anne Boleyn was not a factor in the early stages ofthese doubts,”he asserts, and in any case“we do not know how theyarose.”47By contrast, Thomas Betteridge is convinced“that Anne Boleyn,and Henry’s desire for her, played a significant role in the Reformation’scourse”:“at a fundamental level,”he proposes,“the reason Henry decidedhis marriage to Catherine was not legitimate was undoubtedly because of hisdesire to marry Anne Boleyn.”48IIIWhat, then, is the“truth”of the king’s“great matter”? If we appear to havecome full circle in asking this question then this is because it is almostimpossible to decide what the“truth”is in this case. Like Shakespeare’sHenry, wefind ourselves amid“many mazed considerings,”unsure ofwhich course to“steer”when“hulling”in the historically choppy watersof the king’s“conscience.”On this basis alone we can begin to see how thetitleAll Is Trueis both playfully ironic and philosophically intriguing. Eventhe briefest consideration of the king’s“scruple”reveals, as the play seemsdetermined to show, how“history”is hardly the same as, or a reliable sourceof,“truth.”What is clear, however, is that in presenting both the history ofthe divorce and its participants as unfathomably complex and contradic-tory,Henry VIIIremains entirely true to the spirit ofuncertaintythatcharacterizes this history. This is an uncertainty typical not just of modernhistorical assessments of the divorce, of course, but also of contemporarysources forHenry VIII: those sixteenth-century histories labeled by45Scarisbrick,Henry VIII, pp.154,149.46G.

The“truth”ofsuch things is navigated uneasily by these writers as something fractured andfractious rather than unitary or straightforward.50Yet the fact that such“Protestant”histories would betray a deep ambivalence about Henry VIIIshould not surprise us. As MacCulloch puts it,“King Henry was a difficultfigure for the victors of the English Reformation to celebrate,”and thewritings of Hall, Foxe, and Holinshed reveal this fact implicitly and even, attimes, explicitly.51Contrary to Rudnytsky’s convictions, then, Shakespeareneed not have been a follower of“Catholic”histories to regard Henry’sdubious behavior over his“scruple”with skepticism: the uncertainty andambivalence current inHenry VIIIare also present in the play’s“Protestant”historical sources.52Nowhere does this hesitation over the“truth”of Henry’s“conscience”become more complex historiographically than in Holinshed’sChronicles,the publication history of which reveals something important about thetextual instability of“truth”in the period. Whereas thefirst (1577) edition ofHolinshed’sChroniclesoffers a remarkably brief story of the emergence ofHenry’s scruple, providing a truncated version of the king’s“conscience”speech before the legates at Blackfriars in1529, the second (1587) edition oftheChroniclesprovides a much longer and more detailed rendition.53In fact,the two versions–those of the1577and1587editions–are entirely different.The reason for this discrepancy is straightforward. The1587Chroniclesoffersa version carefully revised by Abraham Fleming,“the chief editor of thesecond edition”:an“aggressively anti-Catholic”and polemically“strenuousProtestant.”54It was Fleming who replaced the sparse account of theBlackfriars trial in the1577Chronicleswith one much richer in detailtaken from a source published three years after thefirst edition of49Rudnytsky,“Deconstruction of History,”50.50MacCulloch,“Introduction,”p.4.

For the“scruple”speech as it appears in2.4ofHenry VIIIfinds its true source, transmittedvia theChroniclesof Stow and Holinshed, in one of the most famous“Catholic”accounts of the divorce, and one famously committed to tellingthe“truth”and yet which remains characterized by“ambiguity and irony”:George Cavendish’s (then unpublished) narrative ofThe Life and Death ofCardinal Wolsey.56It is, in fact, in Cavendish’s account that all of the detailsof Holinshed’s version of Henry’s speech about his“conscience”find theirproper origin: from the more personal tone and hesitant style of Henry’sspeech here, to his exoneration of Wolsey, and even his mistaken referenceto the Bishop of Bayonne. It is in Cavendish’s report that Henry declareshow it was that his“scrupulous conscience”(a phrase repeated at least threetimes) received a“doubtful prick,”which“bred”and“pricked, vexed, andtroubled so my mind, and so disquieted me, that I was in great doubt ofGod’s indignation.”It is Cavendish too whofirst recalls how Henry con-fessed to having been“troubled in waves of a scrupulous conscience,”whilesuffering“in despair of any male issue.”57As an eye-witness present at many such occasions, moreover, Cavendishcarries authority. As such, both Stow and Fleming would naturally be keento preserve the historicalfidelity offered by Cavendish’s narrative as areliablefirst-hand account of the proceedings at Blackfriars. What theyare less keen to preserve, and so carefully excise, is Cavendish’s hostilitytoward a Henry whose hypocrisy is presented as transparent and disgusting.Passages“critical of the Protestant position”are thus deleted.58There is nosense in theChroniclesof Stow and Holinshed, for example, of a Henry who55John Stow,The Chronicles of England(1580) (STC23333), pp.959–65.56Anderson,Biographical Truth,p.136.

InCavendish’s chronology, we should remember, Henry’s“conscience”emerges as a problem, as it does inHenry VIII, only after he has met his“sweetheart,”Anne Boleyn (2.1.97).60In Holinshed, as in Hall and Foxe,this timing is not contradicted or denied: more delicately, it is renderedmore mysterious and yet concurrent with other developments and eventshappening at this time.61If we were left in any doubt of Cavendish’s intention to paint Henry inthe worst light of villainy and hypocrisy possible, we need only note thatCavendish’s most damning condemnation of the king comes immediatelybefore his account of the legatine divorce trial at Blackfriars.“Is it not aworld to consider the desire of wilful princes,”Cavendish asks,“when theyfully be bent and inclined to fulfil their voluptuous appetites...? Andabove all things,”he asserts,“there is no one thing that causeth them to bemore wilful than carnal desire and voluptuous affection of foolish love”:The experience is plain in this case, both manifest and evident, for whatsurmised inventions hath been invented, what laws have been enacted, whatnoble and ancient monasteries overthrown and defaced, what diversities ofreligious opinions hath risen, what executions hath been committed, howmany famous and notable clerks hath suffered death, what charitable foun-dations were perverted from the relief of the poor unto profane uses, andwhat alterations of good and wholesome ancient laws and customs hath beentossed by will and wilful desire of the prince, almost to the subversion anddesolation of this noble realm.62Cavendish’s history of the divorce, one in which the HenricianReformation has its disastrous origins in“this pernicious and inordinatelove”of Henry for Anne Boleyn,63is one that neither Stow nor the moremilitantly Protestant Fleming would replicate in their ElizabethanChronicles. Yet the transplanting of entire passages, such as the Blackfriarstrial of1529, from Cavendish’s history into their chronicle accounts ofHenry’s divorce has important implications for how we view the laterincorporation and reworking of such material inHenry VIII. For althoughneither Fleming nor Stow could commit to presenting a“Catholic”59Sylvester and Harding,Two Early Tudor Lives, pp.86–7.60Ibid., pp.98,124.61See Holinshed,Third Volume of Chronicles, pp.907–8.

Infact, when transferred to theChroniclesof Stow and Holinshed, and fromthence intoHenry VIII, Henry’s words about his“conscience,”althoughderived from Cavendish, appear to be those of a much more sincerelyconscientious king. At the very same time, though, they are also thewords of someone about whom we might feel deeply uncertain. In thisway Cavendish’s account of Henry’s“scruple”is, in effect, converted byStow and Fleming, though not merely from one kind of ethical absolutismto another, that is, from“Catholic”to“Protestant.”Rather, this conversionof history is effected by the reshaping of Cavendish’s unbending moralcertainty about Henry as a voluptuous tyrant into a moreflexible and open-mindeduncertaintyover what the king’s“true”motives were at Blackfriarsin1529. It is this uncertainty that is subsequently dramatized so faithfully in2.4ofHenry VIII.IVThe Protestant tradition of privileging ambivalence–perhaps even skepti-cism–towards Henry VIII’s conscience reaches its apogee, one could argue,inHenry VIII. This is a play, after all, in which the king’s encounter withAnne Boleyn in1.4, long before his“conscience”is openly exercised,generates nothing like any absolute certainty about the king’s motives forwanting a divorce, as the“Catholic”tradition would purport. Instead, itgenerates an even deeper, more radicaluncertaintyabout them as mixed andcontradictory. Far from dictating to its audiences an inflexibly“Catholic”view of Henry as religious charlatan and marital scoundrel, whatHenry VIIIreflects–and that to which it remains steadfastly“true”throughout–issomething arguably much more complicated: a more enlivening, morelifelike, and (in Anderson’s sense of the term) more“truthful”hesitancyabout Henry’s ethical character.64The king’s behavior is thus almostimpossible to nail down in the play, either morally or historically. It hasbeen easy, of course, for commentators to assume thatHenry VIIImust bewritten against“official”“Protestant”histories of the HenricianReformation. Yet, as we have seen, the aim of such histories seems to beone of ensuring that that which is unknown and uncertain remains a key64Anderson,Biographical Truth, pp.130,134.Truth, history, and historical faith inHenry VIII273"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"element of the story, a part of the fabric of historical“truth”itself. Criticswho attempt to assert that the play’s treatment of Henry’s“conscience”iseither entirely sincere or wholly suspect are bound equally to come undonein this respect. The truth is that it is difficult to know how to categorize withany degree of certainty whatHenry VIIIoffers in its treatment of Henry’s“scruple”or indeed of his“Reformation”generally–sincerity or cynicism?As Lee Bliss has put it, we may have to accept both options“as possible, andeven as equally true.”65How, then, can we understand Shakespeare’s treatment of history and itscomplex relationship to“truth”inHenry VIII? Why is“history”so con-certedly and yet disconcertingly divorced from what is“true”in this play?Understandably, these are the questions that have troubled and fascinatedthe play’s critics.66As has been hinted at throughout this chapter, however,one way to understandHenry VIIIis to see it as something which, at almostevery turn, excites but then punctures and deflates our“faith”in the“truth”of the history it presents. The play solicits but then demolishes our faith inthe historical veracity of the events and persons it stages. In this sense, whatmight be standing behindHenry VIII’s employment of“history”could wellbe a simple yet particularly“Protestant”idea: that of“historical faith,”theReformed pedigree of which is important for us to acknowledge whenfathoming the“truthfulness”ofHenry VIII.67Although the term wasoriginally formulated by the German Reformer Philip Melancthon,William Tyndale was thefirst English writer to employ“historical faith”in his debates with Sir Thomas More around1530.68Tyndale argued thatany faith received passively from the church alone, rather than arising fromthe personal experience of the believer, was no more than“historical”innature. It was something acquired by human means only, requiring nomore than superficial assent from the participants and an acknowledgmentthat the stories of Scripture had actually happened and that its personsexisted historically. For Tyndale, the“faith”propagated by Papists couldnever be anything more than“historicall”because it simply“hangeth of the65Bliss,“Wheel of Fortune,”7.66As well as the many examples already cited in previous notes, see also Anston Bosman,“Seeing Tears:Truth and Sense inAll Is True,”Shakespeare Quarterly,50(1999),459–76; and Thomas Healey,“History and Judgement inHenry VIII,”in Richards and Knowles,Shakespeare’s Late Plays,pp.158–75.67On the place of“history”in early modern English thought, see D.

Suchbelief was distinct from what Tyndale calls“felynge faith,”which is“as if aman were there present whan it was wonne”and whosefirst-hand experi-ence of it means that“all the worlde coude not turne him from his faith.”Using another notable analogy, Tyndale explains the difference thus:“Evenlikewise if my mother had blowen on hirfinger and told me that thefirewold burne me,”then, he asserts,“I shuld have beleved hir with an histori-call faith, as we beleve the stories of the worlde...And so I shuld have done,if she had tolde me that thefire had bene cold and wold not have burned,but,”he notes,“assone as I had put myfingre in thefire, I shuld havebeleved not by the reason of hir but with a felynge faith.”69This primacy of a faith centered in the experiential and“felt”convictionof a spiritual“Truth,”one that would be said to exist beyond thecommonly accepted historical facticity of the Bible as a proper record ofancient happenings and persons, would become a cornerstone of scrip-tural interpretation and soterial doctrine in the Reformed tradition.Divines and preachers from Theodore Beza and Jean Calvin to WilliamPerkins and, even later, John Bunyan would repeat a mantra concerningthese two kinds of faith: the“historical”kind–which could be held byanyone, even ungodly hypocrites, reprobates, and devils–and a“true”or“saving”faith, which read Scripture as a communication of somethingdeeper than mere history, recognizing it as a vehicle for“Truth”beyondhistorical facts alone and rooted in thetranshistorical promises of salva-tion.70As the means whereby“credence is yeelded to the History of Godsword”but without the believer being“any whit the better affected...either to love God, or feare him, or trust in him the more for his faith,”asWilliam Gouge would put it,“historical faith”was, for many ReformedEnglish divines, simply no“faith”at all.71To read the Bible as if it weresimply a chronicle of events was not enough: its“Truth”transcended69William Tyndale,An Answere unto Sir Thomas Mores Dialogue(Antwerp,1531) (STC24437), fos.xxix–xxx (fo. xxixv).

The mes-sage, not the story, is what would matter most.Recognizing this Protestant idea of“historical faith”may enable us torecalibrate our understanding of the fraught and sometimes paradoxicaltension between“truth”and“history,”as well as their separation, inHenryVIII, given that so much in the playfissures and splits upon that whichmight be termed historically“true.”As we have seen, some“facts”aboutHenry’s divorce and the beginnings of the Henrician Reformation,including the sincerity of the king’s“scruple,”are simply too obscureever to be verifiable. As a result, the“history”ofHenry VIIIresists even themost basic kind of“historical faith”in its characters and events simplybecause the historical“truth”of such things is just too unreliable, toounstable, too entangled in what Tyndale refers to as“the stories of theworlde”and“the comen fame and consent of many”to uphold anythinglike an unquestionably“true”historicity. In this respect it seems typicallyironic of the play to present a king who, wounded in his conscience overthe sinfulness of hisfirst marriage, claims to have undergone a conversioninto a“feeling faith”of sorts in2.4. In reality, the historical Henry VIIIwas probably capable of no more than“story”faith:“historical faith,”thatis, in its crudest form.72Historians from Hall to Scarisbrick can easilyaccept that, whatever prompted Henry’s desire for divorce, it resulted inhis political“conversion”and“reformation”asaruler:hecastoffhis oldman, Wolsey, and asserted himself more independently as his own king.73Yet, given Henry’s life-long rejection of the most fundamental tenet ofReformed doctrine, justification by faith alone, few would believe in theconspicuously evangelical“conversion”Shakespeare’s Henry claims tohave undergone in2.4.74As such, Shakespeare’s subtle enhancement ofthe language of Protestant transformation in Henry’s“scruple”speech hasa very strange effect: it makes Henry’sidentification with Protestantismstronger and yet draws attention to just how doubtful that identificationwould always be.By ensuring that no certain orfixed“truth”can be yielded by“history,”Henry VIIIsubverts, it would seem, some of the Tudor English chroniclers’grander ambitions to provide their readers with sources of historical“truth”72Scarisbrick,Henry VIII, pp.406–7.73Hall,Famelies of Lancastre & Yorke, fos. clxxxiii(verso)–iiii; Scarisbrick,Henry VIII, pp.245–6,248,326,386–90.74See Scarisbrick,Henry VIII, pp.399–408; Bernard,King’s Reformation, pp.228–43.276Michael Davies"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"as reliable and indeed as true as the Scriptures themselves.75This strategymay explain why the play is so full of sea-changes: those sudden, self-erasingreversals to both character and plot that complicate what is true and what isnot.76All that which is“now best”is shown to be, almost in the samebreath,“now worst”inHenry VIII(1.1.29), and vice versa, whether inrecounting the“fierce vanities”of the Field of Cloth of Gold (1.1.54)orindramatizing Wolsey’s conversion from arch-villain to sincere penitent whofeels his“heart new opened”(3.2.367). The play’s most conspicuous dram-atization of this cancellation of history as a source of“truth”comes climacti-cally, of course, in Cranmer’s prophecy (5.4.14–62). For this is a speechwithout any historical source or precedent, spoken before a king who maynot even have attended the occasion at which it is delivered: the christeningof his daughter, Elizabeth. Cranmer’s vision here serves, too, to completethat which, historically speaking, almost certainly did not occur: Henry’sspiritual regeneration, marked in the play by the king’s inspired but“entirely unhistorical”words,“Thou hast made me now a man”(5.4.64).77What Cranmer’s vision reveals, moreover, is something pro-foundly awful for Henry. It shows him the utter pointlessness of hisattempts, both within and beyond the events dramatized in the play, tosecure a male heir to continue the Tudor dynasty. What is foreseen insteadis that which the audience already knows: the death of the most long-reigning Tudor monarch, the childless“virgin”(5.4.60), Elizabeth I, andwith her the royal Tudor line.78By the end ofHenry VIII, Cranmer’s very different kind of“Truth”–being that on which, he states, both Elizabeth and England will be nursedand nourished (5.4.28)–triumphs not because of the vicissitudes of historybut entirely, it would seem, in spite of them. Cranmer’s“Truth”is, then,like that image of the“phoenix”(5.4.40)sofiguratively central to the largerrhetoric of his prophecy: it is something that rises against the self-defeating and“fruitless”nature of historical ambition, whether Henry’sorWolsey’s. Cranmer’sfinal promise of a phoenix-like pattern of regenerationfor England thus offers“an escape from the endless repetitions of history”and the“immutable recurrence”of history’s pointless victories and75Annabel M. Patterson,Reading Holinshed’s Chronicles(University of Chicago Press,1994), pp. viii–x:Patterson quotes Fleming as stating in the1587edition of Holinshed’sChroniclesthat“Chroniclesapproach next in truth to the sacred and inviolable scripture”(pp. viii and277n.1).76InChapter5above Beatrice Groves notes a similar disconcerting emphasis on unexpected“sea-changes”in one of Shakespeare’s earlier history plays,King John. She, too, reads these reversals aschallenging mere historical“correctness”in favor of a more uncertain, diverse, and profound sense oftruth.77Saccio,Shakespeare’s English Kings,p.225.78Ibid., pp.224–5.Truth, history, and historical faith inHenry VIII277"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"defeats.79In the face of Cranmer’s“Truth,”“history”inHenry VIIIisshown–to borrow one of the play’s own tropes of self-consuming non-progression–to“outrun”itself and, indeed, to“lose by over-running”thevery thing toward which it runs (1.1.141–3): the“truth.”VWhat is revealed to be of“transcendent importance”throughoutHenry VIIIis never“history,”but an idea of“Truth”beyond history, although it is a“Truth”that, as Thomas Betteridge remarks of Hall’s writing of theHenrician Reformation,“endangers the very principle on which”theplay’s“historiography is predicated”: that of“all”being“true.”80Becausethe historical“truth”cannot be known inHenry VIIIor separated fromTyndale’s“comen fame of many”and“the stories of the worlde,”then the“truth”that it asserts in the end must be“ahistorical and asocial”: somethingmore akin, in the terms of Cranmer’s prophecy, to“the truth of the gospel”and the deeper faith that truth requires of believers, a truth beyond arecognition of mere“historical”facts alone. As with Hall’s treatment ofhistory, so too mustHenry VIIIassert its“truthfulness”by“writing aroundor through the official records of the past”in order to produce a“Truth”of avery different quality, purpose, and nature: that of Cranmer’s elegiacvision.81Cranmer’s divining of Elizabeth’s reign thus has the strangelyvertiginous effect of sweeping aside the struggles of Tudor history entirely,revealing the bloody and messy years between the birth of Elizabeth I andthe accession of James I to be strangely irrelevant to itsfinal assertion of“Truth.”In this sense, Cranmer’s prophecy performs another, crucial kindof conversion at the end of the play. It transforms civil or secular history intoa narrative of“sacred reality,”as David Scott Kastan has termed it: one thatprivileges a“transcendent”notion of“Truth”that remains“unconditionaland unchanging,”indeed, beyond“history.”82It goes without saying that Shakespearean drama is not usually consid-ered to work in the ways outlined in this chapter: that is, as subtly butdeterminedly“Protestant”in design and effect, staying paradoxically true tothe“letter”of its historical sources while requiring audiences and readers todiscern an alternative“spirit”within its treatment of historical events andpersons. Nor, perhaps, could any other Shakespeare play be viewed as if it79Bliss,“Wheel of Fortune,”17,20,23.80Betteridge,Tudor Histories,p.67.81Ibid., pp.67–8.82David Scott Kastan,Shakespeare and the Shapes of Time(London: Macmillan,1982), p.137.278Michael Davies"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"were another of Stanley Fish’s“self-consuming artifacts”: as a seventeenth-century text, that is, that seeks to achieve a“conversion”in the“perceptualhabits”of its audiences through strategies that ask them to“discover thetruth for themselves”through a form–in this case, that of“history”or“chronicle”–which becomes“the vehicle of its own abandonment.”83It isin just this way, however, thatHenry VIII“points away from itself tosomething its form cannot capture,”appealing, as Cranmer’s prophecyexemplifies, to the“values”of a“progressively widening vision,”the“truth”of which lies beyond any“version of reality yielded by the senses”alone.84IfHenry VIIIcan be read in the ways I am suggesting, this could leave uswith a formidably different version of“late”Shakespeare. For this would bea dramatist who, even at the very end of his career, remained remarkablyattuned to contemporary discourses of early modern religion: beyond, thatis, an often alleged nostalgia for the rituals and beliefs of the“Old Faith,”but also beyond a more limited, because secular, rootedness in questions of“religious”court politics and Jacobean factionalism.85The Shakespeare ofHenry VIII, by contrast, coauthors a play which looks back carefully uponthe perplexing origins of the Henrician Reformation but which senses, too,a future about to unfold: a turbulent and indeed revolutionary future inwhich, during thefifty years followingHenry VIII’sfirst performances,ordinary men and women would increasingly undergo Henry’s kind of“Puritan”conversion experience and put their narratives of such experienceinto print. They would also bring questions of“conscience”–that keywordof seventeenth-century British history and politics–to bear directly on theirdealings with secular and ecclesiastical authorities in the name and spirit of“true”Reformation. Such is the future Shakespeare seems to be sensing andpeering into intently in hisfinal play,Henry VIII.83Stanley Fish,Self-Consuming Artifacts: The Experience of Seventeenth-Century Literature(Berkeley:University of California Press,1972), p.3.84Ibid., pp.4,7.85For a different reading ofHenry VIIIthat shares a number of this chapter’s larger thematic concerns,seeChapter12above.

Recentscholarship has followed suit, with the New Historicist rediscovery of“virtually every marginalized Other that passed through early modernEngland”leading to the disproportionate scrutiny of Othello, Shylock,and their potential contexts.2Yet dramatizing any kind of religion on the professional stages of latesixteenth- and early seventeenth-century England was a complex proposi-tion; doubly so in the case of religious practice.3The late suppression of thesuspiciously Roman Catholic Corpus Christi plays prompted legislationthat prohibited the counterfeiting or representation of“the Ma(jest)ye ofGod the Father, God the Sonne, or God the Holie Ghoste or the admin-istration of either the Sacramentes of baptisme or of the Lordes Supper”or“anythinge plaid which tende to the maintenaunce of superstition or1A.

The pantheon of classical deities is regularlypresented, and witchcraft occupies a prominent place, both of which arefolded into non-Christian religions in provocative ways. In the often parodiedcauldron scene inMacbeth, for instance, amongst a cascade of ingredients thatinclude“poisoned entrails,”“scale of dragon,”“Witches’mummy,”and arange of animal parts, wefind the“Liver of blaspheming Jew,”a“Nose ofTurk,”and“Tartar’s lips”(4.1.5,22–9).7Scholars tend to gloss such referencesas constituent parts of a cumulative register of barbarity thatfixes the weirdsisters beyond the province of Christ, signaling an encroaching and infernalother world, but these specific elements are not, unlike some of the sisters’other props, simply ephemeral exotica.That it is the liver of a“blaspheming Jew”demonstrates how even anapparently offhand reference might signal religious difference–here pre-sumably a reference to the Jews’bitter and defining unwillingness toacknowledge the divinity of Christ.8There are similar examples elsewhere4Declaration of the Diocesan Court of High Commission at York, quoted in Glynne Wickham,EarlyEnglish Stages,1300to1600, vol.

It has been argued thatthis particular scene may have been added by Middleton.8The many elements of the stereotype of the Jew and its history in England are notably discussed inShapiro,Shakespeare and the Jews, and Anthony Bale,The Jew in the Medieval Book: EnglishAntisemitisms,1350–1500(Cambridge University Press,2007).Shakespeare’s non-Christian religions281"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"in the Shakespearean canon: Falstaffprotests that if he is not telling thetruth, he is“a Jew else, an Hebrew Jew”(1Henry IV2.5.165); Launcedemands that Speed accompany him to the alehouse, for“if not, thou artan Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian”(Two Gentlemenof Verona2.5.44–5); and Benedick reflects upon Beatrice,“If I do not loveher I am a Jew”(Much Ado About Nothing2.3.231–2). Understood on aproverbial level, such shorthand references work antithetically, aligning thesingular“Jew”with Christian sin–specifically, in these examples, withlying, incivility, and a lack of charity. The result is a paradox–the Jew isabsolutely opposed to the Christian, as sin is to virtue, but every Christianhas the potential“to Jew.”The Jew, denied subjecthood, becomes aphantom of the Christian psyche.9Although they seem undifferentiated in the sisters’incantation,“Turksand Tartars”(particularly the former) carry quite different connotations inthis Shakespearean shorthand, and appear more frequently, than“the Jew.”They can be barbarous, as when the Duke of Venice urges Christiansympathy, unlike“stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained / To officesof tender courtesy”(Merchant of Venice4.1.31–2).“The Turk”can also takehis place alongside“the Jew”in a Christian psychodrama: so Hamlet canponder whether“the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me”(Hamlet3.2.253–4), and Margaret can intervene in a discussion about marriage bycautioning Beatrice,“Well, an you be not turned Turk, there’s no moresailing by the star”(Much Ado About Nothing3.4.37–8).

By thefirstperformance ofMacbethall three had been prominentfigures on theEnglish stage. A merchant-usurer named Gerontus had appeared inRobert Wilson’sThreeLadiesofLondon(1581), and Stephen Gossonmentions a play (no longer extant) titledThe Jewwhich depicted“thegreediness of worldly choosers, and bloody minds of usurers”in1587.12Marlowe’s vicious, comic, and influentialJew of Maltawas written in oraround1590, and was followed by Thomas Dekker’slostJosef, the Jew ofVenice(1593) and Shakespeare’sownMerchant of Venice(c.1596).13Thefigure of the Turk had been even more popular than that of the Jew–twenty or more“Turk plays”followed thefirst part of Marlowe’sTamburlaine(1587), and Tartar emperors (the Mongol descendants ofGenghis Khan) had been the celebrated protagonists of the now lost twoparts ofTamar Cam(1592).14The early modern English stage was crowdedwith non-Christianfigures which, aside from these“stock”examples,included a procession of Moors, Amazons, Pigmies, Cannibals, andmany others. Although records suggest increasing numbers of non-Christians arriving on English shoresinthisperiod,itseemslikelythatthe weird sisters’ingredients, as with most of Shakespeare’s references toJews, Turks, and Tartars, are not simply experiential but are instead10Fratricide upon the accession of a new emperor was established practice in the Ottoman Empire ofthis period and was widely reported in English books and pamphlets.11The mirroring of Anglo-French and Christian–Muslim conflicts in the history plays is exploredfurther in Jerry Brotton,“Shakespeare’s Turks and the Spectre of Ambivalence in the History Plays,”Textual Practice,28.3(2014),521–38.12Stephen Gosson,The School of Abuse(1587), p.43, quoted in Jonathan Burton,Traffic and Turning:Islam and English Drama,1579–1624(Newark: University of Delaware Press,2005), p.220.13Burton,Traffic and Turning,p.257.14The plot book ofThe First Part of Tamar Cham, although now lost, was transcribed in the earlynineteenth century and is reproduced in Walter W.

The creation of a character like Shylock is clearly a more complexundertaking than the blunt references to Jews scattered through the canon,and although there are obvious connections, Shakespeare repeatedly playswith the assumptions embedded in that shorthand. Continuity is mostobviously manifest in separation–following the lead of Marlowe’s Barabas,Shylock articulates a keen sense of his own difference and that of his“tribe”(1.3.106) in specifically“racial”terms.16In an early modern context,“race”began to assume some of the connotations of ethnicity and innate differencethat it would carry in a post-Enlightenment period, but it is most often usedto indicate genealogy. When Barabas and Shylock both affirm their partic-ular descent from“father Abram”(1.3.156) in opposition to the Christians,who are“Hagar’soffspring”(2.6.42), they assert a biblical distinctionbetween the two sons of Abraham, Isaac (born of Sarah) and Ishmael(born of Hagar), and make claim to be God’s chosen people–disputingthe tradition which identified Christians as the true inheritors of Isaac andAbraham.17Unlike contemporary biological-genetic conceptions of race, this is anexplicitly religious distinction, one that generates a stage Judaism distinctfrom and antagonistic towards Christianity. At root is a denial of Christ’sdivinity, about which Shylock is explicit from hisfirst entry, referring to“your prophet the Nazarite”(1.3.28) and his own“sacred nation”(1.3.43)in15Records of non-Christians in England are collected and analyzed in Imtiaz Habib,Black Lives in theEnglish Archives,1500–1677(Farnham: Ashgate,2008), and Nabil Matar,Islam in Britain,1558–1685(Cambridge University Press,1998). The intertwining of different non-Christian religions might alsoinclude Roman Catholicism: this is most notably present in the idolatry and witchcraft ofAlphonsus ofArragon, but even the witches’incantation inMacbeth, with its opening invocation of a kind ofthaumaturgical time and elaborate ritual, might hint at anti-Catholic polemic, an element that mightbe heightened (as inAlphonsus) in performance through the use of props, costume, and gesture.16It is worth noting here how the word“tribe”used by both Shylock and Barabas to refer to Jews andJudaism is, in biblical terms, explicitly religious.17The most engaging recent discussion of“race”in an early modern context appears in the introductionto Ania Loomba and Jonathan Burton (eds.),Race in Early Modern England: A DocumentaryCompanion(Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan,2007), pp.1–36.284Matthew Dimmock"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"an aside heard only by the audience. InThe Jew of MaltaBarabas’s tone issimilar–he insists that“all are heretics that are not Jews”(2.3.317),castigating the“swine-eating Christians”as an“unchosen nation, nevercircumcised”(2.3.7–8) and as“Philistines”(2.3.233).18For Christian audi-ences, this foundational difference between their own scripturally affirmedstatus as the new Israelites, the“chosen,”and Jews’erroneous claims to thesame, animates every element of the stage Jew’s characterization. It isaffirmed in Shylock’s unwillingness to eat, drink, or pray with Christians(1.3.31–2); in his profession of usurer (linking him to earlier stage Jews anditself an uneasy reflection on new economic realities); in references to theindelible mark of circumcision; and in the play’s familial dynamic–likeBarabas, Shylock has no living wife or son, but only a daughter of marriage-able age (a“most sweet Jew”[2.3.11]), offering a neat formula for assim-ilation as if the stage Jew were a problem to be solved.19It is to thisfiction of competing narratives of the“chosen”that remnantsof an earlier Christian mythology of Judaism are attached. In Marlowe’splay the incorporation of that mythology is a darkly comic reflection onirrational prejudice, as when Friar Bernardine promises to reveal Barabas’scrime: Friar Jacomo’s immediate assumption is that the Jew has“crucified achild”(3.6.49), an accusation that surfaces in a number of medieval cases.20Shakespeare similarly places elements of this opprobrious tradition in themouths of Christian accusers: thus Shylock is referred to as a dog or cur oneight occasions and as a devil on four, the latter reflecting Judas’s identi-fication as the devil in John6:70and the Jews’as the children“of [their]father the devil”in John8:44.21When the prospect of Jewish cannibalism israised, however, it comes obliquely from Shylock himself, who will go tosupper with Bassanio and Antonio“in hate, to feed upon / The prodigalChristian”(2.5.14–15). Some critics, most prominently James Shapiro, havefound in Shylock’s demands for a pound of Antonio’sflesh an intersectionof such“Jew-libel”mythology with early modern anxieties about circum-cision as a defining mark of difference: that the cut is a kind of circumcision,and“Shylock will cut his Christian adversary in that part of the body where18All references to Marlowe’s plays are taken from Christopher Marlowe,The Complete Plays, ed.

There was an estab-lished costume for the Jew–Shylock refers to his“Jewish gaberdine”(1.3.108), and there are repeated references to Barabas’s apparently prom-inent nose (2.3.177) as well as the possibility of red beards and distinctivehats (referred to by Barabas at4.4.78–9)–although critics do not agree onexactly how it was constituted. Regardless of the exact clothing used, as EvaJohanna Holmberg has noted, we should recognize that“an audience wasaware that what they were seeing were English people portraying Jews.”23Sowhen Shylock enters the stage with Bassanio at the start of Act1, scene3,orBarabas is revealed in his counting house at the opening ofThe Jew of Malta,an audience would make certain assumptions about the nature and role oftheir characters that are then affirmed by the immediate association estab-lished between money, usury, and Jewishness, the biblical encoding of theirdifference, and subsequent allusions to a medieval mythology. But beyond asense that it was a religion that disputed the foundations of Christianity,what doesThe Merchant of Veniceshow us of Judaism?As it turns out, very little; for, in a strictly literal sense, neitherShakespeare’s play norThe Jew of Maltacontains any Judaism. Althoughboth refer to groups of Jews meeting at synagogues, there is no religiouspractice (which may well have been impossible given the prohibitions onstaging Christian religion, as noted above). In its absence–and in theabsence of any stage directions that might indicate a specifically“Jewish”language of gesture–Judaism is almost entirely constituted through refer-ence to Scripture, and it is here that Shakespeare diverges from Marlowe anddramatic convention. Barabas’s language and points of reference are suf-fused with the early books of the Christian Old Testament, correspondingto the Torah and Prophets in the Hebrew Bible. His allusions to“OldAbram”(1.1.105) and to Cain and Adam (3.4.33) come from Genesis. Helaments his fate in reference to the plagues of Egypt and the Passover, callsupon“thou, that with afiery pillar led’st / The sons of Israel through thedismal shades”(2.1.12–13), and reminds his audience of when“heavenrained manna for the Jews”(2.3.253)–all referring to Exodus.

Marlowe even constructs the namesof Barabas’s associates from the Old Testament–Kirriah Jairim and Obed(1.1.123–4) are taken from Joshua and Chronicles, while Ithamore may bederived from Ithamar, one of Aaron’s sons in Exodus.24Marlowe therefore deliberately cultivates Barabas as a creature of the OldTestament, using well-known Mosaic and Abrahamic narratives alongsidedeliberately obscure passages (even for an audience well versed in the Bible).The division this implies between a backward-looking, literalist Judaismand the play’s Christian characters is only enhanced, in thefirst scene ofJewish–Christian confrontation, by the Maltese Knights’explicit use of theNew Testament. Ferneze refers to Matthew27:25–in which the Jewsaccept responsibility for the death of Christ by exclaiming“His blood be onus, and on our children”–when he justifies his actions against the Jews ofMalta through reference to his“sufferance”of their“hateful lives, / Whostand accursed in the sight of heaven”(1.2.63–4), a defense reinforced by theFirst Knight’s assertion of the same“first curse”later in the scene.25Suchreferences point to the true irony of this scene: its playfully transgressiverecreation of the trial of Christ before Pilate, with Barabas, both the MalteseJew and his biblical namesake, standing in for Jesus (a parallel that can beheightened in performance). In response to what he sees as hypocriticalChristian sermonizing on the rejection of worldly covetousness, Barabasturns again to the Old Testament, reminding those who have just con-fiscated his goods of the words of Exodus20:15:“Thou shalt not steal”(1.2.128–9).Judaism inThe Jew of Maltais a montage of Old Testament motifs that iscomprehensible to an audience and has a kind of grudging legitimacy byvirtue of its biblical origins, but which is implicitly obsolete as a system ofbelief due to its supercession by the Christian New Testament. ForMarlowe, this ambivalence, carefully built into his particular stageJudaism, allows a sustained critique of the debasement of religion when in24This section builds on the notes in Burnett’s edition of Marlowe’sComplete Plays, esp. p.592, and inDavid Bevington and Eric Rasmussen’s edition ofDoctor Faustus and Other Plays(Oxford UniversityPress,1995), p.454.25At1.2.110:“yourfirst curse fall heavy on thy head.”Shakespeare’s non-Christian religions287"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"the service of power and wealth. This critique spares neither Jew norChristian, although ironically it does spare the“Turk,”and the Knightsof Malta are so conspicuously Roman Catholic that any moral lessons forProtestant England are only implied.26The“Hebrew”religion is therefore asatirical device, one structured around a characteristically playful use ofarchetype.Aside from the near inevitable hints at parallels between Barabas and hisfortunate namesake and with the betrayer-devil Judas, Job is anotherparticularly prominent paradigm.27Job was a wealthy man of Uz, whosegoods Barabas enumerates in typically assiduous fashion (following theBible once again):“seven thousand sheep, / Three thousand camels, andtwo hundred yoke / Of labouring oxen, andfive hundred / She-asses”(1.2.185–8). Responding to a challenge from Satan regarding the nature ofJob’s faith, God repeatedly tests Job with afflictions, taking everything hehas, and still Job does not curse God in return; ultimately his faith isrewarded with greater riches. When Barabas’s fellow Jews suggest hemight alleviate his suffering at the Christians’hands by reflecting on theexample of Job, he dismisses their suggestion, asserting that Job’s wealth wasnothing compared to his. But then he curses the day he was born inlanguage that follows Job’s own curse very closely (1.2.194–201; Job3:1–6). Having lost his wealth, Barabas then proceeds to follow Job’sexample by regaining his riches not once but twice–raising the possibilitythat he in fact might be, as he insists, one of God’s chosen nation.That provocative possibility is of course dashed in Barabas’s elaboratedeath, and here too wefind Marlowe toying with an Old Testamentarchetype. The Book of Esther (which precedes the Book of Job) tells thestory of Haman who, having gained favor with King Ahasuerus, plots tohave his enemy Mordecai hung on a gallows“fifty cubits high”(Esther5:14).When his treachery against the honest Mordecai is discovered, Haman ishanged on the very gallows he had prepared for his enemy (Esther7:9–10),just as Barabas is drowned in the same cauldron he intended for Selim-Calymath. The irony is that Haman, on whose actions Barabas’sfinal plot issurely based, was renowned as an enemy of the Jews, since Mordecai was aprominent Jew. If this is more than a dark joke on Marlowe’s part, it may be26Marlowe’s playfully positive characterization of the Ottoman prince Selim-Calymath is furtherdiscussed in Burton,Traffic and Turning, pp.221–2.27The role of Job inThe Merchant of Venice,Othello, and in Venetian society is analyzed in considerablymore detail in Julia Reinhard Lupton,“Job in Venice: Shakespeare and the Travails of Universalism,”in Laura Tosi and Shaul Bassi (eds.),Visions of Venice in Shakespeare(Farnham: Ashgate,2011),pp.105–21.288Matthew Dimmock"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"intended to effectively deny Barabas’s Judaism any connection with theIsraelites of the Old Testament, whose legitimate inheritors were, it wasoften claimed, English Protestants. Instead, Barabas and his Judaism areconnected to a biblical emblem of evil in a dynamic familiar from the greatreligious cycles of medieval drama.28Superficially, Judaism inThe Merchant of Venicelooks very similar.Shylock’s religion is similarly comprised of echoes of the Old Testament:aside from the lineage implied by“father Abram”(1.3.156), he describesLauncelot as a“fool of Hagar’soffspring”(2.6.42), he shadows the apoc-ryphal Ecclesiasticus34:22(“He that taketh away his neighbour’s livingslayeth him”) in the lines“you take my life / When you do take the meanswhereby I live”(4.1.372), and he references Genesis32:10in swearing“byJacob’s staff”(2.5.35).29Jacob is presented by Shylock as a kind of justifica-tory archetype in his discussion with Antonio over the legitimacy of interest(1.3.68–86, on which more below). Both Barabas and Shylock have a Mosaicinsistence on the word of“law”(4.1.141); both lose their wealth in themanner of Job; and it could be argued that, like Barabas and the biblicalHaman, Shylock is ultimately hoist by his own petard. However, unlikeTheJew of Malta, in which Barabas’s Old Testament theology is rigorouslyjuxtaposed against the New Testament theology of that play’s Christiancharacters, the religious divisions ofThe Merchant of Veniceare far lessdistinct.30The breakdown of any easy opposition on the basis of faith is demon-strated in the disguised Portia’s inability to distinguish which“is themerchant here, and which the Jew”(4.1.169) in her entrance to the courtscene, and is in part a consequence of Shakespeare’s decision to placeShylock not at the center of the play (as Marlowe had done with Barabas)but on the periphery, both in the number of lines he speaks and in hisminimal role in the Portia–Bassanio love match. Shakespeare requiredsomething different from his staged Judaism, and its contours shifted as aresult. Unlike Barabas inThe Jew of Malta, a play in which scripture is usedto justify violence and rapacity, Shylock is the most conspicuously religious28See, for example, the discussion in John Tolan,Saracens: Islam in the Medieval European Imagination(New York: Columbia University Press,2002), pp.129–31.29This section builds on the detailed notes in John Russell Brown (ed.),The Merchant of Venice,Arden Shakespeare (London: Methuen,1955), pp.26,51–2,119.30This emphasis on the rather unique religious ambiguity in Shakespeare’s plays accords with DavidBevington’s and Peter Marshall’s views above; this chapter, though, ultimately sees Shakespeare’srepresentation of non-Christian religions, despite their being subtler and more understated than hiscontemporaries’,aseffectively concretizing and reinforcing the Christian beliefs and practicesendorsed in these same plays.Shakespeare’s non-Christian religions289"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"figure inThe Merchant of Venice. No other character directly quotesscripture, and Shylock’s theological corpus unusually includes both Oldand New Testaments. He is acutely aware, for instance, of the Christians’defining belief in the divinity of their prophet“the Nazarite”(1.3.28), but hisreference to the“fawning publican”(1.3.36) probably comes from Luke18:10–14; his insistence that“My deeds [be] upon my head”(4.1.201) stemsfrom Matthew27:25(the same passage quoted by Ferneze and the FirstKnight above); and his assertion that the Jews are“the stock of Barabbas”(4.1.291)reflects the events narrated in Mark15:6–15. The last two of thesereferences suggest that Shakespeare turned to those passages in the Gospelstraditionally used to assert Jewish responsibility for the crucifixion of Christnot to emulate Marlowe but to allow Shylock to damn himself and hisreligion, in keeping with the intensely Christian emphasis on mercy andprayer in the court scene. Paradoxically, it is through the expression of hisreligion in this scene that Shylock comes to tacitly acknowledge–and againin some sense replay–the truth of that defining accusation, paving the wayfor hisfinal conversion.31Earlier in the play the difference between Christians and Jews is notmarked by divergent Old and New Testament positions or soteriology.Instead it is based on the differing exegesis of shared scripture: a departurewhich emphasized the theological proximity of the two religions but alsodemonstrated the well-documented“literalism”of Jewish interpretationand its confutation.32When Shylock is negotiating with Antonio for theloan of three thousand ducats, they fall to disputation concerning thejustification for usury (an issue prominent in late sixteenth-centuryEngland). In proposing the example of Jacob and Laban’s sheep (fromGenesis30:25–43), Shylock asserts a biblical precedent for interest, sinceJacob manipulated pregnant ewes to produce“parti-coloured lambs”thatwould be his.33In scornful opposition, Antonio asserts that only the powerof God could bring such a thing about, pointing out to Bassanio that the“devil can cite Scripture for his purpose”(1.3.94). Here shared scriptureprovides the basis for negotiation–and differing interpretations prove nobarrier to commerce–but after marveling at Shylock’s ingenious reading ofthis episode, an audience is left with Antonio’s image of Judaism as a“goodly apple rotten at the heart”(1.3.97).31The various forms in which accusations of Jewish complicity in the crucifixion of Christ appear inearly modern writings are discussed in Shapiro,Shakespeare and the Jews,passim.32Ibid., p.127.33This exchange is considered at greater length in Andrew Hadfield,“Shakespeare and RepublicanVenice,”in Tosi and Bassi,Visions of Venice, pp.67–82.290Matthew Dimmock"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Less obvious as an example of disputation, but more in keeping with theHaman archetype, is the use of Daniel in the court scene. The scene beginswith Shylock’s exclamation approving Portia (disguised as Balthasar) as“ADaniel come to judgement, yea, a Daniel! / O wise young judge, how I dohonour thee!”(4.1.218–19). This is a straightforward acclamation of Portia’sapparent probity, in reference to the Apocryphal“History of Susanna”inwhich the young Daniel (whose name translates as“God is my judge”)intervened to convict the two elders that were about to falsely condemnSusanna for adultery. As Shylock reads it, he is the wronged Susanna, the“daughter of Israel”(Susanna48), and his Christian antagonists the falsewitnesses. Later, as Portia’s manipulation of the terms of Shylock’s contractand the law become clear, it is Graziano who taunts Shylock in return:“Asecond Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!”(4.1.328) and“A second Daniel, still say I, asecond Daniel!”(4.1.335). The unrestrained glee with which Graziano usesShylock’s own terms of reference in triumph over him can obscure hisdivergent reading of the same scripture. In Graziano’s use of Daniel theprimary identification of Portia–Balthasar as the embodiment of righteousjustice remains, but it is Antonio who becomes the innocent and wrongedSusanna, and Shylock the false elders–an identification made all the moreforceful in the way that, like Haman and Barabas, the elders’own actionscondemn them (Susanna51–8). Once again Jews are responsible for theirown downfall and obsolescence.Shakespeare’s recreation of Judaism for the early modern stage is thusprimarily a scriptural construction, built from a tissue of quotation, refer-ence, and archetype in order to create the appearance of a coherent theol-ogy, but one that is always already past, defeated by the truth of Christ. Inthe apparently casual references that litter his dramatic works, Shakespeareuses Jews and Judaism in a theatrical shorthand to signal sin and non-Christian contrariness. When involved in a more sustained dramatization,Marlowe had constructed a world of basic religious oppositions debased byhuman greed, in which Judaism became almost as provocatively valid as theMaltese Knights’Roman Catholicism. InThe Merchant of Venicethecontradictions and disputations that Shakespeare carefully embeds in hissophisticated stage Judaism cause any theological coherence or validity tounravel as the play progresses. In drawing on dramatic precedent and theBible, but offering a shared scriptural language whose valid interpretation isalways a Christian prerogative, Shakespeare creates a Judaism that is neithera viable alternative to Christianity nor (in a Marlovian sense) satirical.Instead, his Judaism is made subservient to the plot and structure of acomedy that ends in the sanctification of a double Christian marriage.Shakespeare’s non-Christian religions291"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Shakespeare’s IslamAct2, scene4of2Henry IVfeatures thefirst entrance into the play ofFalstaff’s ensign, identified on the title page of the play’sfirst quarto as“swaggering Pistol.”34His arrival is anticipated by Falstaff, MistressQuickly, and Doll Tearsheet, and here again he is described as a“swaggerer”and“the foul-mouthedest rogue in England”(2.4.60–1).

Somecritics have gone further, arguing that these passages reveal another aspect ofthe shifting relationship between Shakespeare and the ghostly influence ofMarlowe; Robert Logan, for instance, has suggested that in his character-ization of Pistol, Shakespeare“took advantage of the comic richness latentin the Marlovian prototype”and that“Pistol’s role as a comic Tamburlaineseems to be his chief reason for being.”40Or alternatively, as Jerry Brottonhas suggested, Pistol’s reference to a series of“Turk plays”is a further sign ofthe ways in which Shakespeare’s history plays in particular are haunted bythe“spectre”of Islam.41It is certainly the case that Tamburlaine’s bombastand braggadocio had been a primary element in those characters thatappeared thereafter–Muly Hamet inAlcazar, Mahamet inThe TurkishMahomet, and Tamburlaine himself, as well as in a range of“Grand Turks”on the stage. But its comic potential was also quickly exploited. Basilisco inSoliman and Perseda(thought to be by Thomas Kyd) is a prominentexample; and, solely in a Shakespearean context, Logan has suggestedHotspur from1Henry IV, Samson inRomeo and Juliet, and the Prince ofMorocco inThe Merchant of Veniceas examples of this role; and there arealso Jonson’s later Volpone and Sir Epicure Mammon.42Pistol is therefore a recognizable comic caricature, part of (but also aresponse to) the“Turk play”tradition. But Islam is not a central element ofthis caricature, nor of Pistol’s original quotations. To ridicule the“Turkplay”does not seem to require reference to Islam. Pistol’s muddled recre-ation of himself as a thundering epic hero is absurd, perhaps all the more sosince he repeatedly identifies himself with non-Christian characters–andTurks on the Elizabethan stage were associated with bombastic excess–butthe role Pistol thinks he is assuming here is not an explicitly Muslim one. Ofthe three characters Pistol quotes, only one, Peele’s Turkish sultanMahomet, seems to have been unequivocally Muslim, like those dramaticsultans–the Amuracks, Amuraths, Bajazeths, and Solimans–thatfollowed. While both Tamburlaine and Muly Hamet are associated withIslamic lands, neither are explicitly Muslim–Hamet veers towards akind of pagan polytheism, while Tamburlaine acknowledges“Mahomet”whom he once“thought a God”(2Henry IV5.1.174), but burns theAlcoran in defiance of him.43None of the later comic braggart examples,40Robert Logan,Shakespeare’s Marlowe: The Influence of Christopher Marlowe on Shakespeare’s Artistry(Farnham: Ashgate,2007), p.157.41Brotton,“Shakespeare’s Turks.”42Logan,Shakespeare’s Marlowe,p.157.43There is further discussion of this episode in Dimmock,New Turkes, pp.156–9.294Matthew Dimmock"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"not evenMerchant’s Prince of Morocco, are explicitly Muslim either, withthe possible exception of Kyd’s Basilisco, who comically converts to Islamwithout realizing it.44There has been some debate about the nature ofShakespeare’s Morocco: is he, as Logan has argued, a“comic character-ization”of a“Tamburlainian warrior hero,”or is he, as Jonathan Burton hasalternatively suggested, a dignified and noble alternative to“the stereotypeof the lascivious, blustering”stage Turk?45He is certainly a subject of theOttoman Sultan, and is dressed“all in white”–his costume presumablyincluding a turban (as stipulated in some modern editions)–and he iscertainly grandiloquent in the Tamburlaine mould; but beyond the impli-cations of costume, nowhere does he deliberately articulate a Muslimidentity. I want to suggest that Shakespeare’s unwillingness to unequivo-cally characterize Morocco as a Muslim is related to his turning away fromthe“Turk play”genre, as suggested by Pistol’s comic manglings.This turning away can only be explained through a more detailedconsideration of the curious nature of Islam on the early modern Englishstage. It is important to recognize that for most early modern English readersthere was in fact no such thing as“Islam”but only“Mahometanism,”animportant conceptual and verbal distinction that highlights how the Islamicfaith was understood as basically the heretical inverse of the Christian one,with the all too human Mahomet rather than Christ as its central deity.Mahomet was imagined as a false prophet, a cynical manipulator of hisfollowers, a fabricator of miracles: manipulative, lascivious, and violent, a“juggling”mortal who fraudulently performed divinity. For those who reador heard them (such material was a popular source for sermons), suchscurrilous details of Mahomet’s life were confirmed by a considerable andauthoritative body of printed and manuscript material, the early examples ofwhich affirmed the notion that he was an idol, a version that would linger onin the romance tradition.46For the stage, however, Mahometanism was a different entity, anddramatists seem to have struggled tofind a suitable way to materialize it.InTamburlaineand the“Turk plays”that followed, Mahometanism wasitself a performance, designed to generate what Jonathan Sell has identifiedas an“exophoric representation,”the deliberate creation of a sense of44Thomas Kyd (?),The tragedye of Solyman and Perseda(London: Edward Allde for Edward White,1592), sig.

In another indication of how much writersdepended on Christianity as a model, it was the invocation of Mahomet thatwas the most common means of indicating Mahometanism–such asBajazeth’svowby“Ye holy priests of heavenly Mahomet, / That, sacrificing,slice and cut yourflesh, / Staining his altars with your purple blood”(1Tamburlaine,4.2.2–4). These characters perform their veneration ofMahomet, and do so in exaggerated ways, as in Tamburlaine’s hubristicrejection of Mahomet. It is as if Mahometanism, this heretical system, hadto be shown to be false through its gross theatricalism, an extension of thejuggling theatricality of its founder. But this too was not consistent. Mahometoften took his place in a classical pantheon of gods (suggesting again anuncertainty as to how to dramatize Mahometanism), or as a demonicfigure,or even, as in Greene’sAlphonsus of Arragon,asa“brazen idol”breathingflames and prophesying to his followers. It was further possible for a staged“Turk”not to invoke Mahomet at all and thus immediately to be identified asa sympathetic character, like Corcut in Greene’sSelimus.48This chaos ofpossible Mahometanisms, all performance and bombast, with no one seem-ingly clear about what exactly Mahomet and his religion might be, becameincreasingly ridiculous and unsustainable. Certainly Greene’sidolofMahomet’s head, referred to in contemporary verse as“Mahomet’sPoo,”gained a kind of absurd comic notoriety.49If we recognize that this was thespecific context in which Shakespeare came to write, it hardly seems surpris-ing that staging Mahometanism was something the savvy playwright tried toavoid.Yet while Shakespeare never wrote a“Turk play”per se (that is, if wediscount for the purposes of this chapter the suggestion thatTitusor2HenryVIare kinds of“Turk play”), the“Turk motif”nevertheless appears in at47Jonathan Sell,Rhetoric and Wonder in English Travel Writing,1560–1613(Farnham: Ashgate,2006),p.16.48Corcut is discussed further in Dimmock,New Turkes, pp.175–7, and is mentioned in this context inBurton,Traffic and Turning,p.109.49This poem,“A Farewell,”is reproduced alongside Peele’s companion piece,“An EclogueGratulatory,”in David Horne (ed.),The Life and Minor Works of George Peele(New Haven, CT:Yale University Press,1961), vol.i, pp.220–30.296Matthew Dimmock"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"least thirteen of his plays.50As I have suggested, this may simply have been aquestion of timing: that what we tend to recognize as the matureShakespeare from the later1590s onwards came after the initial popularityof the post-Tamburlaine“Turk play”and developed as a reaction to itsfading. There was probably no commercial pressure to create such a play,whether from company or audiences. Yet its traces remain throughout hiswork, and it is perhaps more accurate to talk of Shakespeare being hauntedby the“Turk play”than by Islam. This is a useful distinction to make,simply because those instances wefind in Shakespeare that do refer toMoors or Turks seem to intentionally step back from the stale bombastassociated with the“Turk play”in which a confused, unstable, and hyper-theatrical vision of Mahometanism was embedded. Instead, Shakespeareinnovates by doing something that seems counterintuitive, and which no“Turk play”had consistently done: he answers the uncertainties and failuresin the vision of Mahometanism presented in the“Turk play”bydown-playingit. After the hundreds of references to Mahomet that appear in the“Turk plays,”the lack of reference to Mahomet by Morocco, or in thecontext of the Ottoman threat inOthelloor more generally in Shakespeare,is suggestive of a new and different direction.That Shakespeare’s only explicit reference to Mahomet comes in a play like1Henry VIis therefore revealing. The Dauphin’s exclamation to Joan,“WasMahomet inspired with a dove? / Thou with an eagle art inspired then”(1.2.140-1), is a curiously ambivalent statement since in the countless timesthis story was told in early modern English sermons and books, it wasinvariably a vehicle for absolute condemnation: the tale of Mahomet’s merefabrication of a miracle by inserting peas in his ears to attract a dove, a dovethen falsely identified as the Holy Spirit, was read as a sure sign of a lack ofdivinity and a damning disproof of Mahometanism. Yet Shakespeare’suseofthe story is either ironic–celebrating Joan while nodding to an audience’sknowledge of this myth and its implications for her characterization–or it isalmost provocatively relativistic, recognizing without explicit condemnationwhat inspired Mahomet, and thus what inspires Mahometans. Either way it isunusual in terms of early modern writing about Mahometanism.So it is perhaps the case that Shakespeare’s decision not to explicitlyacknowledge Mahomet or Mahometanism inOthelloor through the Princeof Morocco is less theatrical innovation than it is a recognition of howculturally literate audiences had become after the post-Tamburlaine“Turkplay”phenomenon, in ways they had not been in the late1580s. It might50Hutchings,“‘Turk Phenomenon,’”5.Shakespeare’s non-Christian religions297"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"also suggest that Shakespeare was more interested in emphasizing“Moroccanness”and“Ottomanness”or“Turkishness”–a set of character-istics relating to culture or ethnicity that might include but are not defined ordominated by religion. That Shakespeare chooses to refer specifically to the“turbanned”and“circumcised”nature of the Turk whom Othello remem-bers encountering in Aleppo (5.2.362–5) indicates that religion is still animportant factor, but this turn to alternative signifiers of Mahometanismrather than conventional references to Mahomet suggests Shakespeare’sunease at how contested Mahomet’s status and nature had become.ConclusionShakespeare’s various allusions to the two Abrahamic non-Christian reli-gions indicate an awareness of their dominant forms in early modernEnglish culture but also an unwillingness to blindly reproduce thoseforms. Instead, both Judaism and Islam are pushed back to the fringes ofhis plots and there reconstituted, threatening but insubstantial. Shakespearechooses to no more than hint at the religious practices associated witheither, nor does he address the vexed questions regarding the status ofMahomet. And he does not bind the two religions together in infamy, acommon move by his contemporaries. Rather, the two are kept deliberatelydistinct: the Jew a debased and anachronistic interlocutor whose religion isdesigned to be recognizably and intrinsically invalid; the Mahometandenied either scriptural congruence or religious coherence, embodied inthe martially aggressive male.These non-Christian religions are used to underpin a structural emphasison Christianity in plays likeThe Merchant of VeniceandOthello, in whichtheir largely unrealized presence throws the Christian values and virtues ofthe protagonists (or their lack) into sharp relief: the skewed dynamic of thecasket test is perhaps the obvious example. The Venetian and widerMediterranean setting of both plays parallels this formal element. In theseterms, in constructing his stage Judaism and Islam as constituent elementsof a specifically Christian worldview, Shakespeare signals an engagementwith an Erasmian abstraction of Turks to Christian sins, and leans towards aCalvinist Protestant universalism in which Muslims and Jews are simplymisguided Christians awaiting their shepherd, an influential view endorsedin the Book of Common Prayer.5151Erasmus,“A Most Useful Discussion Concerning Proposals for War Against the Turks”(1530) (alsoknown as“De Bello Turcico”), in Dominic Baker-Smith (ed.),Collected Works of Erasmus(University298Matthew Dimmock"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"In dramatizing Islam and Judaism at all, however, Shakespeare had torespond to their semantics within theatrical culture and to the contested,crude, and contradictory forms in which both Jews and Mahometans hadbeen hitherto represented. It is to this context, rather than to any detailedtheological engagement, that we must look tofind non-Christian religion inShakespeare. This was a playwright establishing an audience and a reputa-tion in a crowded marketplace, and his depiction of non-Christian religionis intrinsically theatrical: there is no evidence that he looked beyond hisBible and some continental histories and romances for source material,indicating either a lack of interest in or a lack of access to sources thatdelineated religious belief (let alone any detailed reading or intuitive sense ofJewish theology, the Qur’an, or Sufism, as some have suggested).52Instead,a search for non-Christian religion in Shakespeare’s work reveals a play-wright responding directly and with nuance to the ways Judaism and Islamwere already encoded in the playhouse, and doing so with a keen sense ofchanging theatrical fashions, audience tastes, and the constraints of form.On those few occasions when Shakespeare does attempt to signal theexistence of a non-Christian belief system in anything more than an off-hand, polemical fashion, what we glimpse is absolutely defined by its“not-Christianness,”a device subservient to character and plot. It is Shakespeare’sdecision to render non-Christian religion as background rather than fore-ground that sets him apart from the bombast of the1580s and early1590sand his contemporaries, and shows us a playwright in the making.

C. Bradley in his classic work,Shakespearean Tragedy:The Elizabethan drama was almost wholly secular; and while Shakespearewas writing he practically confined his view to the world of non-theologicalobservation and thought, so that he represents it substantially in one and thesame way whether the period of the story is pre-Christian or Christian.2Throughout the twentieth century the prevailing view of Shakespeare wasthat he was to be interpreted and studied outside of a religious context, thathe saw the world in a“non-theological”way.In part, as in Bradley, this was an observational stance based on a readingof the texts. None of Shakespeare’s plays takes a biblical subject, forinstance, for its plot. There is no outwardly devotional or doctrinaltheme. However, Bradley also participated in a theory of literature thatwith increasing rigidity founded itself on a division between the secular andthe religious. This was not, in Bradley’s case, out of any antireligious bias. In1907–8he delivered the Gifford Lectures at Glasgow on the subject of“Ideals of Religion.”Through an exploration of spirit, mind, idealism,truth, reality, and good and evil, he aimed to understand what religion is,and what human needs it seeks to satisfy. However, it was part of Bradley’sreligious idealism to distinguishfirmly in a philosophical sense betweenpoetry and religion. Poetry is part of his explanation of what he calls“the1Shakespeare and the Invention of the Human(London: Longman,1998), p.3, borrowing a phrase fromNorthrop Frye.2A. C. Bradley,Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth,2nd edn.(London: Macmillan,1905), p.25.300"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"inadequacy of natural religion.”3The religious is a transcendent worldwhich is separate from the manufactured andfictive language of poetry.Bradley’s writing on Shakespeare and on religion coincided with thefirstdevelopment of English Literature as an academic discipline. Indeed, he wasthefirst person to hold the chair of Literature at Liverpool University, andwas later offered (but declined) thefirst chair of English Literature atCambridge.4It can be argued that the very identification of the“literary”as a distinctive subject is part of a struggle to see literature as an emergentforce in culture which comes about through a dissociation from religion. InMatthew Arnold’sCulture and Anarchy(1869), culture arises out of aseparation from religion, and thus acquires its capacity to restore society:“Religion says: The kingdom of God is within you; and culture, in likemanner, places human perfection in an internal condition, in the growthand predominance of our humanity proper.”5Literature appears whereangels fear to tread. A theory of secularization, in this sense, lies at theorigin of the study of English as a discipline. The absence of religion fromthe plays of Shakespeare is therefore not incidental, but axiomatic to theemergence of modernity. From Bradley in1904to Bloom in1998,Shakespeare’s exceptionalism lies in this capacity to explain a secular viewof culture as postreligious.It is something of an irony that thefirst stirrings of an alternative view ofreligion in Shakespeare came with New Historicism. In despite, that is, ofan aggressively Nietzschean rejection of the lure of theology, NewHistoricist studies acknowledged the power of religious languages andfantasies in early modern culture. This often took the form of a repeat ofthe secularization thesis–religious ideology fails and is replaced by tragedyas a radical critique–but it allowed by the back door a sense of how thereligious is inscribed in Shakespeare.6This was followed at the turn of thetwentienth century by a seemingly quite opposite movement. Long-standing biographical rumors about Shakespeare’s residual Catholicismcombined with an interest in religion as a form of covert and suppressedpolitical identity. Various shades of recusancy allied Shakespeare’s plays3Bradley,Ideals of Religion: Gifford Lectures Delivered at the University of Glasgow in1907(London:Macmillan,1940), p.56.4G. K.

In some features it becamethe antithesis of the“linguistic turn”from which it derived its name.Religion returned Shakespeare to the habitus of human and social subjec-tivity. Especially in the“Catholic Shakespeare”argument, religion became akind of proxy coat of transcendental personal identity, wresting literatureback from deconstruction. In other forms, by a deeper irony, it was arestoration of the secularization thesis. The deconsecrated forms of medi-eval religion were given an afterlife in the maimed rites of the Elizabethantheater. Shakespeare lamented their disappearance but also sealed their loss.Behind the more obviously controversial claims of the“religious turn”inShakespeare studies, therefore, lie deeper ruptures concerning historicismand personal identity. And behind these, it may be argued, is a conflictabout interpretation and meaning, one which continues to haunt the verydefinition of what literary study claims to be. Bloom avers that to tieShakespeare to the particularity of religious confessionalization is to assumethat plays can only be interpreted in a specific, historicized way. Whereas (inhis view) it is the special quality of Shakespeare’s work, or indeed of anyliterary work, not to be quantifiable in this way. At the same time, hissterling defense of a secular Shakespeare has coincided with a vexed dis-cussion among the social sciences over whether the“secularization thesis”has prevailed at all.8While literary study long assumed that the horizon ofmodernity looked out on a secular realm, the newest forms of literary theorycall this entire paradigm into question. Shakespeare is now as likely to beseen through the lens of political theology as of secular evangelism orenfranchisement.9What the chapters in this volume collectively show, however much theyare invested in such a theorization, is that definitions of both“religious”and“secular”are in urgent need of revision. In this way the initial energies of the“religious turn”have some unexpected trajectories.

Within the terms ofthe Reformation controversy, meanwhile, Peter Marshall, in discussing theresidual Catholicism of Elizabethan Warwickshire, and Felicity Heal, inreassessing the emergent public Protestantism of Shakespeare’s London,both reveal how much more hybrid and volatile religious identities were inpost-Reformation England than was once assumed. Conferring a religiousidentity on Shakespeare need not mean straitjacketing the plays to aparticular confession. In that way, the plurality of the theater or of theliterary is not threatened by the religious, but enriched by it.In a different direction, Peter Lake and Adrian Streete realign the forcesof religious and secular intellectual history. The history of ideas, as much asthe history of literature, has recently been in the throes of a difficult divorcefrom the secularization thesis. The seventeenth-century revolutions inscientific and political thought are both subject to religious revisionism,though not without contention.10Primary in the continuing secular camphave been the proponents of classical republicanism. Lake, working in thetradition of mapping neo-Roman political culture against Puritan andCatholic forms of resistance theory,finds less a chasm between classicaland Christian thinking than a form of mutual stress. In that way, Bradley’sassumption that a Roman garb means always a nontheological framework ismisplaced. Similarly, Streete shows how Lucretian atomism is vexed withChristian anxieties about death and dissolution rather than offering anescape.Other chapters in this volume take specific plays and show how thereligious historicization of Shakespeare’s work does not need to be tied to aconfessional motivation. One of the interesting aspects of this is that playswhich have sometimes proved resistant to historical interpretation, whetherthrough neglect (King Johnhere examined by Beatrice Groves,Henry VIIIby Michael Davies and Paul Stevens) or through overfamiliarity (AMidsummer Night’s Dreamin the hands of Alison Shell,King LearofDavid Loewenstein), can come to mean something rich and strangethrough the intervention of the peculiar alchemy of religious identity.However, the largest lesson of all that emerges from this book is thefalseness of the dichotomy between the religious world and the secularworld. It is one of the binding assumptions of the secularization narrativethat the secular is a hermetically sealed concept of opposition. The paradox10Peter Harrison,The Fall of Man and the Foundations of Science(Cambridge University Press,2009);Eric Nelson,The Hebrew Republic: Jewish Sources and the Transformation of European PoliticalThought(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press/Belknap Press,2010).Afterword303"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"is that it thus conjures into existence a category which did not have meaninguntil the idea of the secular. The“religious”in modern parlance is a termwhich is effectively forced to equal“nonsecular”as much as the other wayround. Yet archaeologists and anthropologists of premodern societies com-monly reject the idea of a religious sphere. All of life was religious in themodern sense: but in that way it is hardly a differentiable category since itdefines a way of life in the round. Indeed, that is what Max Weber meant inhis ground-breaking conceptualization of world religions via his study ofEntzauberung(“disenchantment”).11Ewan Fernie, in his account of thedemonic inMacbeth; Michael Witmore in his wide-ranging analysis oftheological semiotics; Richard McCoy in his skeptical chapter onfideism,all show their sympathy with what is coming to be called“postsecular”(aswell as“post-Christian”) thought in the twenty-first century. Paul Stevensmakes as the centerpiece of his argument the apostle of postsecularity, theCanadian philosopher Charles Taylor. Taylor’s meditative work in modernapologetics,A Secular Age, provides an intriguing postscript to the travail ofShakespeare’s latter-day existential religious crisis. Shakespeare has gonefrom being secular to being postsecular almost without catching breath.Taylor at once appeals to the grand narrative that once underpinnedShakespearean studies, and yet also undercuts this narrative in providingthe outline of a countertheory.“Our age is very far from settling in to acomfortable unbelief,”he says.12This melancholy apprehension of the“unquiet frontiers of modernity”(Secular Age,p.711) is a far cry from thesecular triumphalism of a previous generation. However, could it be that anunderstanding of religion as ideologically fragmentary and subjectivelyunpredictable is not exclusively modern, but also applicable to the earlymodern? Taylor’s idea of the plurality of modern religious beliefs mayyet allow for a new way of understanding the post-Reformation world ofmixed and metamorphosing confessions, and of Shakespeare’s ambivalentregister within that world. What is obvious is that we can no longer dowithout early modern religion in thinking about Shakespeare.11The phraseEntzauberung der Welt(“disenchantment of the world”) originates in Weber’s late lecturegiven in Munich in1918and published in1919,“Wissenschaft als Beruf,”in Johannes Winckelmann(ed.),Gesammelte Aufsätze zur Wissenschaftslehre(Tübingen: J.C.B.
