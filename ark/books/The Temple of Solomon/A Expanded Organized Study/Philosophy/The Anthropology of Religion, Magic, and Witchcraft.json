Here the emphasis is not on the trainingof majors, of whom there are few, but on meeting a general education requirement in the socialsciences or humanities. Most significantly, this course is probably the only anthropology coursethat such students will take. Therefore the instructor has the obligation not only to discuss thetopics of religion, but also to teach the student about the nature of anthropology and to present itsbasic principles.We had great difficulty in finding a textbook that is appropriate for this type of course.Three types of books exist. First is the reader, which often includes articles that are too advancedfor the introductory student. A major problem is the inconsistency of terminology and conceptsas the student moves from article to article. The second is the general textbook on the anthropol-ogy of religion; but these appear to be written for upper-division students who have already beenintroduced to the field and often heavily emphasize theory. Third, there are abundant books onthe more familiar world religions but few that discuss religions in small-scale societies, wheremuch of the anthropological studies have been conducted. Our goal in writing this text has beento introduce the beginning student to the basic concepts involved in the anthropological study ofreligion, including an introduction to ethnographical information from a wide range of societiesand a basic introduction to the field of anthropology.One of the most difficult decisions we have had to make in writing this text is the organizationand order of presentation of topics. The range of topics is large, and they overlap in myriad ways—everyone has his or her own approach. We have attempted to present the material beginning withbasic concepts and proceeding to the more complex. For example, we begin with myth, symbolism,and ritual before moving on to magic and witchcraft later in the text.We have attempted to include a number of ethnographic examples with a good geo-graphical distribution. Societies discussed in the text are included in Table 1.1, “Culture Areasof the World,” and the locations of many of these are shown on the maps that are new to thisedition. Of course, many topics are associated with classic ethnographic studies, which havebeen included. We have also attempted to balance the presentation of a wide variety of cultureswith the inclusion of certain key societies that reappear as examples of several topics through-out the text, to give students some continuity and a deeper understanding of a small group ofsocieties. These societies include the Navaho of North America, the Yanomamö of SouthAmerica, the Azande and Yoruba of Africa, the Murngin of Australia, and the TrobriandIslanders off the coast of New Guinea.The writing of a manuscript is a major and complex undertaking. It is a thrill to see thebook in print, but when reading it in book form and using it in class, the authors often see thingsthat could have been done a little differently, as well as having ideas for new avenues to explore.We have continued to make a number of changes in this third edition. Some of these changes areminor: a little reorganization, an expansion or contraction of a particular topic, the introductionof a new example or elimination of an old one, and a little rewording to make the point a littleclearer. Other changes are more substantial. We have added new and expanded sections on “TheBiological Basis of Religious Behavior,” “Sorcery, Witchcraft, and AIDS,” “Modern-Day WitchHunts,” and “The Living Dead: Vampires and Zombies,” including sections on “The Vikingxiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Draugar” and “Zombies in Modern American Culture”; added four new boxes on “ReligiousToys and Games,” “Menstrual Tabus,” “How Do You Get to Heaven?” and “The John FrumCult”; and have created two new maps showing the locations of many of the societies that arediscussed in this text.To assist the student in learning the material, we have divided each chapter into severalsections with different levels of headings. Terms that appear in the Glossary have been set inbold. Each chapter concludes with Summary, Suggested Readings, Suggested Websites, andStudy Questions. Additional material and suggested exam questions are presented in theInstructor’s Manual.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe want to take this opportunity to thank the many faculty members who have aided us in thewriting of this text by reviewing the manuscript and offering advice and suggestions.Katherine Bradford, Los Angeles Mission CollegeNicola Denzey, Bowdoin CollegeCharles O.

We will examine the religious lives of abroad range of human communities from an anthropological perspective.The term anthropological perspectivemeans many things. It is a theoretical orientation thatwill be discussed later in the chapter. It is also an approach that compares human societies through-out the world—contemporary and historical, industrial and tribal. Many college courses andtextbooks focus on the best-known religions, those that are practiced by millions upon millions ofpeople and are often referred to as the “world’s great religions”—Judaism, Christianity, Islam,Hinduism, and Buddhism, among others. This book will expand the subject matter to include andfocus on lesser-known religious systems, especially those that are found in small-scale, traditionalcommunities. As we do this, we want to look for commonalities as well as to celebrate diversity.This book will not simply describe a series of religious systems. We will approach thestudy of religion by looking at particular topics that are usually included in the anthropologicaldefinition of religion and providing examples to illustrate these topics from the anthropologicalliterature. We obviously are unable to present the thousands of religious systems that exist orhave existed in the world, but we can provide a sample.THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVEThe subject of this book is religion as seen from an anthropological perspective. What does thismean? The term anthropologyrefers to the study of humanity. However, anthropology sharesthis subject matter with many other disciplines—sociology, psychology, history, and politicalscience, to name a few. So how is anthropology different from these other disciplines?One way in which anthropology differs from other subjects is that anthropology is an inte-grated study of humanity. Anthropologists study human societies as systematic sums of their parts,as integrated wholes. We call this approach holism. For example, many disciplines study marriage.The anthropologist believes that a true understanding of marriage requires an understanding of all1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religionaspects of the society. Marriage is profoundly influenced by politics and law, economics, ethics,and theology; in turn, marriage influences history, literature, art, and music. The same is true ofreligious practices and beliefs.The holistic nature of anthropology is seen in the various divisions of the field. Traditional an-thropologists speak of four-fields anthropology.These four fields are physical anthropology, archaeol-ogy, linguistic anthropology, and cultural anthropology. Today, with the rapid increase and complexi-ty of anthropological studies, anthropologists are becoming more and more specialized and focusedon particular topics. The often-simplistic concept of anthropology as being composed of the integrat-ed study of these four fields is rapidly breaking down, but a review of these four fields will acquaintthose who are studying anthropology for the first time with the essential nature of the discipline.Physical anthropologyis the study of human biology and evolution. Physical anthropolo-gists are interested in genetics; evolutionary theory; the biology and behavior of the primates, thegroup of animals that includes monkeys, apes, and humans; and paleontology, the study of thefossil record. Anthropologists with a biological orientation discuss the evolutionary origins andthe neurobiology of religious experience.Archaeologyis the study of people who are known only from their physical and culturalremains; it gives us insight into the lives of now extinct societies. Evidence of religious expres-sion can be seen in the ruins of ancient temples and in the art and writings of people who lived insocieties that have faded into history.The field of linguistic anthropologyis devoted to the study of language, which, accordingto many anthropologists, is a unique feature of humans. Much of religious practice is linguisticin nature, involving the recitation of words, and the religious beliefs of a people are expressed intheir myths and literature.Cultural anthropologyis the study of contemporary human societies and makes up thelargest area of anthropological study. Cultural anthropologists study a people’s social organiza-tion, economics and technology, political organization, marriage and family life, child-rearingpractices, and so forth. The study of religion is a subject within the general field of culturalanthropology. However, we will be drawing on all four subfields in our examination of religion.The Holistic ApproachStudying a society holistically is a very daunting task. It requires a great deal of time—time toobserve human behavior and time to interview members of a society. Because of the necessity ofhaving to limit the scope of a research project, anthropologists are noted for their long-term stud-ies of small, remote communities. However, as isolated small communities become increasinglyincorporated into larger political units, anthropologists are turning more and more to the study oflarger, more complex societies. Yet even within a more complex society, anthropologists maintaina limited focus. For example, within an urban setting, anthropologists study specific companies,hospitals, neighborhoods, gangs, clubs, and churches. Anthropological studies take place overlong periods of time and usually require the anthropologist to live within the community and toparticipate to a degree in the lives of the people under study, while at the same time making objec-tive observations. This technique of study is referred to as participant observation.Students of anthropology are initially introduced to small communities such as foragingbands, small horticulturalvillages, and groups of pastoral nomads. They become familiar withthe lives of the Trobriand Islanders off the coast of New Guinea, the Navaho of the AmericanSouthwest, the Yanomamö of northern South America, the Murngin of northern Australia, and theSan of southern Africa. Some people refer to these societies as being “primitive,” but primitiveis"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion3a pejorative term, one laden with negative connotations such as inferior and “less than.” A betterterm is small-scale. When we say small-scale, we refer to relatively small communities, villages,and bands that practice foraging, herding, or technologically simple horticulture.We will also be examining aspects of what are often referred to as the “world’s great religions.”Like the term primitive, the term greatinvolves a value judgment. These familiar religions includeJudaism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. They are similar in that the origins of these religions arebased on the lives of a particular individual or founder, such as Moses, Christ, Mohammad, and theBuddha. These religions have spread into thousands of different societies, and their adherents numberin the millions. The small-scale societies that are more traditionally studied by anthropologists, bycontrast, are usually not based on the lives of particular prophets or founders. They tend to be limitedto one or a few societies, and their adherents might number only a few hundred or a few thousand.If they involve only a very small number of people, then why study these smaller religions?Among the many questions that anthropologists ask about humanity are the following: Are therecharacteristics that are found in all human societies, what we might call human universals? Andwhen we look at universals, or at least at very widespread features, what are the ranges of variation?Returning to the example of marriage, we could ask the following questions: Is marriage found inall human societies? And what are the various forms that marriage takes? We might ask similarquestions about religion. To answer these questions, anthropologists go out into the field, studyparticular communities, and write reports describing these communities. Questions of universalityand variability can be answered on the basis of descriptions of hundreds of human societies.In addition, the goal of anthropology is to study the broad range of human beliefs andbehaviors, to discover what it means to be human. This is best accomplished by examining reli-gious and other cultural phenomena in a wide variety of cultures of different sizes and structures,including our own. It is often said that the aim of anthropology is to make the strange familiarand the familiar strange. Only through cross-cultural comparisons is this possible.The Study of Human SocietiesEthnographyis the descriptive study of human societies. People who study human societies andwrite ethnographies about them are cultural anthropologists; they are sometimes referred to asethnographers.However, not all descriptions of human societies are written by ethnographers. For exam-ple, an archaeologist is someone who studies the physical and cultural remains of societies thatexisted in the past and are known today only from their ruins, burials, and garbage. Yet archaeol-ogists can, to a limited degree, reconstruct the lives of people who lived in ancient societies.Sometimes the only descriptions we have of people’s lives are those written in diaries and reportsby explorers and colonial administrators. Although these descriptions are far from complete andobjective, they do provide us with some information.Although we will visit a few societies that are known solely from their archaeologicalremains, most of the examples in this book are from societies that exist today or have existed inthe recent past. Many of the societies we will discuss were first visited and described by anthro-pologists in the early to mid-1900s. Although these societies have changed over time, as allgroups do, and although many of these societies have passed out of existence, anthropologistsspeak of them in the ethnographic present; that is, we discuss these groups in the present tenseas they were first described by ethnographers.Throughout this book we will be presenting examples from the ethnographic literature.These communities are found throughout the world, including some very remote areas. To better"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religionunderstand their nature and distribution, we can organize these societies into culture areas. A cul-ture area is a geographical area in which societies tend to share many cultural traits. This happensbecause these groups face similar challenges from the environment and often come up with similarsolutions and because cultural traits that develop in one group easily spread to other nearby groups.Each human society—and even subgroups within the society—exhibits unique characteris-tics. The common traits that define a culture area tend to lie in the realm of subsistence activitiesand technology, a common response to the challenges from the environment, although some simi-larity in other facets of the society, including religion, may also be found. For example, theCalifornia culture area, whose boundaries are somewhat different from the present-day politicalunit, includes a group of communities that exploit acorns. Acorns require processing that involvesmany steps and much equipment, but they provide a food resource that is plentiful and nutritiousand that can be stored. These features permit the development of permanent and semipermanentcommunities, unlike those developed by most foragers.1Table 1.1 lists the major culture areas ofthe world along with the names of representative groups. All of the groups used as examples in thisbook are included. Many are located on the maps located in the front of the book.TABLE 1.1Culture Areas of the WorldNorth AmericaArctic Coast(Inuit, Yup’ik)Hunting of sea mammals and caribou, fishing;shelters made of snow blocks, semisubterraneansod houses, summer tents made of skins;dog-drawn sledges, tailored skin clothing;settlement in small family groups.Northern Subarctic(Chipewyan, Winnebago)Hunting caribou, fishing;

One commonly used scheme is to organize societies in terms of their subsistence strate-gy, focusing on how they make a living (Table 1.2). Commonly used categories are foragers, horti-culturalists, pastoralists, and agriculturalists. Of course, these are not precisely delineated cate-gories but divisions of a continuum. Foragers are peoples without any form of plant or animaldomestication. They tend to live in small, isolated groups that are found today primarily in areasthat are difficult to farm. Horticulturalists are peoples who garden in the absence of fertilization,irrigation, and other advanced technologies. Pastoralists are peoples whose primary livelihoodcomes from the herding of domesticated animals. Peoples who plow, fertilize, and irrigate theircrops are termed agriculturalists.The latter develop relatively large communities with more com-plex technologies. Societies that have the same subsistence strategy generally have other features incommon, such as settlement patterns, population density, and the presence of specialists.The Fore of New Guinea: An Ethnographic ExampleIn the preceding sections of this chapter we learned about some basic concepts of anthropology, suchas holism, and we were introduced to the concept of ethnography. Now let us turn our attention to aparticular example to illustrate these ideas."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The holistic approach sees human behavior as a complex set of interacting behaviors andideas. In examining a society, we might begin with a particular problem that interests us, butwe soon realize that to truly understand this problem, we have to look at many other aspects ofthe society.An example of this was a study of the Fore, a group of about 14,000 horticulturalists livingin the eastern highlands of New Guinea (Melanesia culture area). The problem that brought theFore to the attention of the Western world was a medical one. The solution to the problembrought the Nobel Prize in Medicine to one of the investigators.When the Australian government first contacted the Fore in the 1950s, a significant numberof individuals were found to be suffering from a particular illness. The illness was having a majorimpact on the population: about 200 people were dying of the illness each year, the victims beingprimarily women and children.This illness is characterized by a variety of symptoms, but the most obvious ones are jerk-ing movements and shaking, which make planned motor activity difficult. The course of theillness is about nine months. At the end the victim can no longer stand or sit up and can no longereat or drink water and soon dies. The Fore call this illness kuru,which means “to tremble withfear” in the Fore language.Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion7TABLE 1.2Food-Getting StrategiesForagersPastoralistsHorticulturalistsIntensiveAgriculturalistsExamplesSan, Murngin,ShoshoniNuer, MaasaiGururumba,Yanomamö, AzandeAztec, Korean,AmishFood gettingFood collectors: gathering, hunting, fishingAnimal husbandryFarming with simple hand toolsFarming with advanced technology (e.g., irrigation, fertilization, plows)CommunityvariablesLow populationdensity, smallcommunity sizeLow populationdensity, small to medium community sizeModerate population density, medium community sizeHigh populationdensity, largecommunity sizeSettlementpatternsNomadic orseminomadicNomadic or seminomadicBasically sedentary, may move after several yearsPermanentsettlementsSpecializationNo full-timespecialists, somepart-timeFew full-timespecialists, some part-timeFew full-time specialists, some part-timeMany full-timespecialistsSocialstratificationGenerally noneSomeSomeSignificant"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of ReligionThe medical team that was sent in to deal with the disease sought the cause. Because itappeared to be largely confined to the Fore, the team thought it might be genetic or due to a toxinin the environment. However, kuruwas finally determined to be the result of an infectious agentcalled a prion. The major question was how the kuruprion was passed from one person to another.Was it passed on through contaminated water, through the air, or through sexual activity? Theanswer to the puzzle was proposed by anthropologists: cannibalism.It was the custom of the Fore to eat the body as part of the funeral rituals—one aspectof their religious practices. The body of the deceased was carried down to an abandonedfield, where kin dismembered and cooked it. Close relatives then consumed the pieces.Because cooking does not destroy the prions, some of them entered the bloodstream throughcuts and open sores and eventually entered the brain, where, many years later, the personbegan to show symptoms of the disease. Because women and children, who have lowersocial status, were more likely to eat the brain, they were the most likely to develop thedisease.The modern medical community now had an explanation for what caused the diseaseand knew how it was transmitted from one individual to another. The government had a“cure” to the epidemic: eliminate the practice of cannibalism. As a result, cannibalismstopped, and kurueventually disappeared, although this took some time because the diseasehas a long incubation period. However, the Fore themselves did not understand this explana-tion and stopped eating the bodies of their dead only because not to do so would mean spend-ing time in jail. The Fore did not accept the scientific explanation of the disease. Think abouthow difficult it would be for the doctors to convince the Fore that kuruwas caused by tinyprions that no one could see. One might as well be talking about tiny evil spirits that also can-not be seen.The Fore knew the cause of kuru,at least in their world. It was the result of sorcery. Thesorcerer would steal something that was once a part of or in contact with the victim, such as apiece of clothing or a lock of hair. The material was then made into a bundle along with someleaves, bark, and stones and was bound up into a package. After reciting a spell, the sorcererwould place the bundle into muddy ground, and as the bundle rotted, the victim would developthe symptoms of the disease. This belief influenced everyday behavior, as individuals were care-ful to hide things that could be retrieved and used by a sorcerer.In spite of this caution, people still developed kuru. In this case, a divinationritual wasused to reveal the identity of the sorcerer causing the illness. As we will see in a future chapter,many people use such techniques to reveal things that are difficult or impossible to discover byother means. Once the sorcerer was identified, the Fore had many options to counter the activityof the evildoer. A person with kurumight also have consulted a healer.The fact that kurustruck primarily women had significant social consequences. Many menlost wives through kuru, and the shortage of women meant that many men were unable to findwives. In addition, men with children who had lost their wives had to perform many domesticchores normally reserved for women, including farming.The ethnography of the Fore and the description of kuruillustrate the concept of holism(Figure 1.1). From the Western point of view, we begin with a medical problem: a disease. Thenwe see how this fatal disease affects various aspects of the society because of the death of womenof childbearing age. This includes marriage, the family, the raising of children, farming, and soforth. Also, we see how the society attempts to explain and deal with the disease through reli-gion. A description of kuruamong the Fore as only a medical problem fails to provide us with acomplete understanding of that disease."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion9Illness and DeathFuneral RitualsDiet and SubsistenceEconomySex andGenderSorceryDivinationPopulationDynamicsMarriage andFamilyFIGURE 1.1Holism.A complete understanding of the disease kuruamong the Fore of New Guinea requires an understanding of therelationship of kuruto other aspects of Fore culture, some of which areshown in this diagram.Two Ways of Viewing CultureWe can ask the question: What causes kuruamong the Fore? From our viewpoint a completeanswer to that question includes both biological factors (the disease-causing organism) andcultural factors (the practice of cannibalism). However, the Fore themselves would give anotheranswer to this question: Kuruis caused by sorcery. Another aspect to the holistic approach is toconsider both insider and outsider perspectives.An anthropologist—or any scholar, for that matter—cannot be completely neutral andobjective when describing a culture. Observation, recording, and analysis involve processingdata in one’s mind. One’s own cultural background, education, training, and other factors willact as a filter or lens that colors what are thought of as objective observations. Physicians, usinga medical model, searched for the cause of kuruthrough techniques learned in medical schoolthat are based on a set of postulates developed through the scientific method. Although thephysicians were able to discover the biological cause of kuru, the disease-causing protein, theywere unable to discover the mode of transmission. Medical science identifies a series of trans-mission pathways, and none of them offered a valid explanation. It took anthropologists, view-ing the situation from a holistic, anthropological viewpoint, to make the connection betweenkuruand cannibalism, although this had to be confirmed through a set of procedures mandatedby the scientific method.The physician and the anthropologist are outsiders looking in. They see Fore culture interms of Western philosophy and theory. They speak of the Fore using words that categorizeexperience in a particular way. This is referred to as an etic perspective. There are advantages to"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"10Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religionan etic perspective. Just as a friend or therapist might see patterns to a person’s life that the per-son might overlook, an outside analyst might see patterns of behaviors or beliefs in a culture thatthe members of that group might be unaware of. Another advantage is that the anthropologist canapply a consistent form of analysis to many different societies that are being studied. Thispermits anthropologists to make comparisons between societies and perhaps to discover someuniversal principles about human behavior.Yet the Fore see their world from an altogether different perspective, using linguistic cate-gories and basic assumptions about their world that differ profoundly from ours. To the Fore,sorcery is the ultimate cause of kuru, and this makes sense in their culture. An emic perspectiveis one that attempts to see the world through the eyes of the people being studied. Of course, thebig question is, how successful can we really be at this?Cultural RelativismHow do you feel about the Fore practice of cannibalism? In the course of looking at differentsocieties, anthropologists often observe behaviors that seem strange and sometimes disturbing.We have grown up in a particular society, and the behaviors and ideas of our own society seem tous to be natural and correct. It is also natural to use our own society as the basis for interpretingand judging other societies. This tendency is called ethnocentrism.Anthropologists realize, however, that a true understanding of other peoples cannot developthrough ethnocentric interpretations. Thinking of other people as primitive, superstitious, andimmoral only colors our observations and prevents us from reaching any kind of true understand-ing about human behavior and thought. Anthropologists attempt to remain neutral and to acceptthe ways of life of other communities as appropriate for those who live in these communities.Anthropologists attempt to describe and understand people’s customs and ideas but do not judgethem. This approach is known as cultural relativism. The goal is to study what people believe,not whether or not what they believe is true.For example, funeral rituals differ from other rituals in one major respect: There is a deadbody. All societies have ways of disposing of the corpse in one way or another. Burial is quite com-mon, but there are a number of variables such as where the grave is located, what the body is buriedin, what objects are buried with the body, and so on. Bodies can also be placed in trees to decay, andlater the bones may be cleaned and buried. Bodies can be cremated, and the remains kept in a con-tainer, buried, or scattered at sea. Among the Yanomamö of Venezuela and Brazil, the crematedremains are ground into a powder. At various times after a person’s death, the family gatherstogether and prepares a banana stew into which some of the cremated ashes are mixed. Then theydrink the mixture. And, of course, as we saw with the Fore, there is the custom of eating the body.The practice of drinking cremated remains or eating human flesh would probably horrifymost North Americans, and its practice in U.S. society would probably lead to some type ofreaction on the part of the society—most likely psychiatric confinement. On the other hand, theYanomamö are horrified by the U.S. practice of burial because it leads to the decay of the bodyin the ground. They believe that the finest expression of love is for close relatives to provide afinal resting place for their loved ones within their own bodies. Is this practice wrong, immoral,or dangerous? The answer to this question, of course, lies within the cultural practices of thegroup and how that group defines correct and appropriate behaviors.POSTMODERNISM.We may wonder if it is at all possible for someone from one society totruly get to know and understand people living in another society. Beginning with the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion11Renaissance, scholars based their knowledge on the ideals of rationality, objectivity, andreason. Science was seen as the means for the discovery of knowledge, truth, and progress.This way of approaching an understanding of the world is termed modernity. It was thoughtthat through modernity order could be created out of chaos. Based on the principles ofmodernity, scholars believed that it was possible to gain a true understanding of all peoplesand all societies.In more recent years, the field of anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism.Beginning in the 1980s, the postmodern movement had a broad academic impact across manydisciplines. In stark contrast to the ideas of modernity, postmodernism denies the possibility ofacquiring, or even the existence of, “true” knowledge about the world. All knowledge is seen asbeing a human “construction” that we must try to “deconstruct.” The postmodern movementemphasizes the limitations of science, that the whole is more than the sum of the parts, that thereare multiple viewpoints and truths, and the importance of being aware of our own viewpoints andbiases. In contrast to modernity’s emphasis on order, postmodernism sees contradictions andinstabilities as being inherent in any social group or practice.The value of postmodernism for anthropology has been to reinforce the idea of multiple waysof seeing the world—that there is no one right way to think or to do things. This is an extension ofthe concept of cultural relativism. Postmodernism serves as a reminder of how the ethnographerherself can influence the fieldwork situation. As a result, ethnographers are more self-consciousand more aware of their own positions and biases (Box 1.1). Every person sees the world throughthe lens of his or her own culture. We cannot remove the lens, but we can become more aware of it.Postmodernism, taken to its logical extreme, says that it is impossible for a person from oneculture to understand someone from another culture. Perhaps it is even impossible for any one per-son to truly understand any other person. Given all this, could anthropology as a discipline evenBOX 1.1Karen McCarthy Brown and VodouKaren McCarthy Brown first met Mama Lola in 1978. On the basis of a dozen years of researchand writing, Brown would write the classic ethnography Mama Lola: A Vodou Priestess inBrooklyn. This book was at the forefront of many important trends in anthropology. It was cen-tered on the experiences of a single individual and was influenced by feminist and postmodernideologies. In the book, Brown speaks candidly of her own experiences doing participant observa-tion research and how she became involved in the religion of Vodou to a degree that perhapseven goes beyond that standard—becoming a Vodou priestess herself. (The Vodou religion will bediscussed in Chapter 11.)The book focuses on the life and practices of Mama Lola, a Haitian immigrant living in NewYork City. Among the themes of the book is the persecution experienced by Haitians in the UnitedStates and the difficulties they face in trying to practice their religion. Brown continues to focus onreligious practices that take place outside of standard religious institutions. This kind of activity hasbecome a major part of religious life in modern urban cultures. This is especially true in the UnitedStates, where religious pluralism is on the rise, partly owing to recent immigration patterns."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religionexist? Most anthropologists have taken a middle ground approach—appreciating the lessons ofpostmodernism while attempting to avoid this extreme point of view.UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS.Some anthropologists, however, question the approach of com-plete neutrality represented by cultural relativism and the approach of complete subjectivity ofpostmodernism and ask: Are there any basic human rights and universal standards of behavior?This is an area of debate, one that often focuses on the religious practices of other peoples thatmay include such customs as physical alterations of the genitalia or cannibalism.Cultural relativism is one of the basic concepts necessary to anthropology, and it should notbe put aside lightly. Our first approach to any cultural practice should be to try to understand itin context—to understand the meaning it has for people in that culture. After doing so, however,is it possible to say, “I understand this practice and why this culture does it, but it is still wrong”?The difficulty in this is knowing where to draw the line, and strict criteria must be used. One suchset of criteria was proposed by Robert Edgerton:2I shall first define [maladaptation] as the failure of a population or its culture to sur-vive because of the inadequacy or harmfulness of one or more of its beliefs or insti-tutions. Second, maladaptation will be said to exist when enough members of apopulation are sufficiently dissatisfied with one or more of their social institutionsor cultural beliefs that the viability of their society is threatened. Finally, it will beconsidered to be maladaptive when a population maintains beliefs or practices thatso seriously impair the physical or mental health of its members that they cannotadequately meet their own needs or maintain their social and cultural system.It is important to note that the criteria are based on the survival of the society and its abilityto function—not on an outsider’s perception of morality. Edgerton includes as an example thehigh levels of stress and fear related to witchcraft beliefs in some cultures, a topic to which wewill return to in Chapter 10.The Aztec practice of cannibalism is another example. The prehistoric Aztecs were anagricultural society located in the Mesoamerica culture area. In Aztec society a small eliteused religious and military power to conquer neighboring groups. They took tribute in theform of gold and other valuables from the people they conquered. Both slaves and capturedprisoners of war were sacrificed and eaten. The benefits of the conquest went almost exclu-sively to the elite. One analytical approach to the practice of cannibalism by the Aztecs arguesthat it was an adaptation to a protein-poor environment. A culturally relativistic approachwould also point out that the sacrifices were done to please the Aztec gods. Edgerton arguesagainst both of these interpretations.Edgerton points out that sacrifice and cannibalism were conducted with very little ritualpreparation—bodies were rolled down steeply sloped temple steps to be butchered below. Thebodies were dealt with in much the same way as a side of beef might be. Human flesh was con-sidered a delicacy and greatly desired, to such an extent that wars were fought with the primarygoal of gaining human captives for sacrifice.The negative impacts were not only on the neighboring groups. The Aztec elite did notshare the wealth with the commoners. Even commoners who served in the army did not do so asequals. While the nobles wore helmets, armor, and shields, the commoners had none of thisequipment. As Edgerton writes, “The splendors of Aztec culture cannot be denied, but they wereachieved at great cost by the many largely for the benefit of the ruling few.”3"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion13Despite this questioning, cultural relativism remains of utmost importance to anthropolo-gists. Our first approach should always be to try to understand a culture’s beliefs and behaviorsin context, to learn what meaning the world has through their eyes.The Concept of CultureIn the previous examples of the Aztec and the Fore, we observed a number of specific behaviorsand beliefs. For example, an anthropologist living among the Fore for a period of time would, ofcourse, record descriptions of Fore life in much more detail and cover many other aspects of theirlives—marriage and family, child rearing, hunting and farming, trade, technology, political orga-nization, folklore, and so on. It is obvious that the body of behaviors and beliefs of the Fore arequite different from ours. These behaviors and beliefs make up Fore culture.In anthropology the term cultureis used as a technical term. It does not refer to the arts orthe “finer things of life.” Although the term is widely used and discussed, finding a definitionthat is acceptable to all anthropologists is a difficult task.The British anthropologist Edward B. Tylor (1832–1917) first used the term cultureinits anthropological sense. In 1871, Tylor wrote, “Culture...is that complex whole, whichincludes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habitsacquired by man as a member of society.”4In this definition Tylor recognized that culture isa “complex whole,” which is a reference to the holistic concept. And he noted that cultureincludes customs that people acquire by growing up in a particular society; that is, cultureis learned.When we look at a group of social insects, such as ants, we see a society in which individ-uals behave in certain stereotypic ways. When we look at a group of humans, we also see certainbehaviors that appear to be stereotyped, repetitive, or customary. Yet besides the much greatercomplexity of human behavior, there is a major difference between ant and human behavior. Antbehavior is innate; that is, it is coded in the genes—it is a part of the ant’s biological heredity.Although some aspects of human behavior are likely to be innate, the preponderance of humanbehavior is learned, handed down from one generation to the next, and is shared by a group ofpeople. Culture is seen in the way people dress, how they greet one another, how they go abouttheir chores, and how they worship their gods. For example, the actions that are performed in aritual are actions that are learned from someone else, perhaps a parent or a priest, and thus theyare passed down from one generation to the next.One of the consequences of the social transmission of culture is that human behavior iscomplex and variable. Unlike biological inheritance, in which change occurs slowly through themechanisms of biological evolution, learned behavioral patterns can change very rapidly inresponse to changing conditions. Also, the human species, which is very homogenous biologi-cally, exhibits a great many different cultures.Another important feature of culture is that it is based on the use of symbols. Symbols areshared understandings about the meaning of certain words, attributes, or objects, such as the colorred symbolizing stopin traffic signals. The connection between the two is arbitrary; there is noobvious, natural, or necessary connection. For example, in U.S. culture, black is the color associ-ated with mourning. However in other cultures, the color associated with mourning may be white,red, or even green.Culture is learned primarily through symbols. Language can be thought of as a string ofsymbols, and we learn, communicate, and even think through the use of these symbols.Symbols are obviously an important area of discussion for the study of religion. The Christian"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religioncross, for example, symbolizes not just the religion itself, but a particular philosophy and his-tory. Chapter 3 discusses the nature of symbols and their role in religious practice.VIEWING THE WORLD.The idea of culture involves much more than describing human activity.People also have different belief systems and different perceptions and understandings of theirworld and their lives.Culture gives meaning to reality. We live in a real, physical world, yet this world is trans-lated through the human mind onto a different plane. We look out a window and see a mountainrising above us. To the geologist the mountain is a structure made of rock formed through natur-al processes. To the hydrologist concerned with bringing water to a desert town, the mountain isthe place where snowfields are found. To the biologist it is the home of a great many plants andanimals, many of them perhaps endangered.To many people, however, a mountain is much more than a physical thing. The mountainmight be the home of the gods or the place where the souls of the dead congregate after death.Mountains figure prominently in many Biblical stories; for example, Mount Sinai was whereMoses received the Ten Commandments, and Mount Ararat was where Noah’s ark came to rest.Psalm 121 reads: “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.”5Othersacred mountains include Mount Olympus, where the gods of ancient Greece lived, and the foursacred mountains of the Navaho world. We may label these images as being part of the imagina-tion of a people, yet to the people the sacredness of a mountaintop may be as real as the presenceof rocks, snow, or plants.THE STUDY OF RELIGIONThe beginning point of any discourse is to define the object of study—in this instance, religion.Yet the task of defining this term is a challenging one indeed. We must avoid using a definitionthat is too narrow or one that is too vague. Many definitions that have been proposed have beenso narrow that they apply only to some cultures and only to some of the phenomena that anthro-pologists traditionally place within the domain of religion. Such definitions often are ethnocen-tric, including only those ideas that are considered “religious” for that culture. In such definitionsmany topics, such as magic and witchcraft, are often excluded. On the other hand, a definitionthat is too inclusive and vague loses much of its meaning and usefulness.In spite of the difficulties of defining religion, anthropology is a social science, and themethodology of science requires that we define our terms. We need to use an operant definition.This is one in which we define our terms so that they are observable and measurable and there-fore can be studied. So what would a good operant definition of religion be? We can start bylooking at the various ways in which scholars have attempted to define the term.Attempts at Defining ReligionMany definitions of religion share many of the elements that we included in our definition ofculture. Perhaps we can define a religion as a system of beliefs and behaviors, based on a systemof symbols. But how can we distinguish religious beliefs and behaviors from other aspects ofculture? After all, we can recognize, for example, particular beliefs, behaviors, and symbols thatdefine political or economic processes.Analytic definitionsfocus on the way religion manifests itself or is expressed in a culture. Anexample would be defining religions by stating that religious practices generally include rituals."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion15Ninian Smart, for example, stated what he felt were the six dimensions of religion.6Theseinclude the following:• The institutional dimension (organization and leadership)• The narrative dimension (myths, creation stories, worldview)• The ritual dimension (rites of passage and other important ritual activities)• The social dimension (religion being a group activity that binds people together)• The ethical dimension (customs, moral rules)• The experiential dimension (religion involving experiences of a sacred reality that isbeyond ordinary experience)Functional definitionsfocus on what religion does either socially or psychologically. Forexample, rituals would be seen as a means to bring a group together and bring individuals comfort.Theorists who have used a more functional definition of religion include Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud,and anthropologists Émile Durkheim and Clifford Geertz. Geertz wrote, “A religion is: (1) a systemof symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivationsin men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these concep-tions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.”7One of the problems with functional definitions is that they could apply equally well tobeliefs and behaviors that are not religious in nature. Others feel that functional approaches arereductionist, reducing religion to a few feelings and behaviors that are not, in and of themselves,religious. For both these reasons, it can be difficult to separate religious and nonreligious systemsusing a functional definition. This does not mean that the social and psychological functions are notimportant. They are, and functionalism as a theoretical approach to studying religion (discussedfurther below) has much to offer. As a definition, however, it alone is not sufficient.An essentialist definitionof religion looks at what is the essential nature of religion. It empha-sizes the fact that religion is the domain of the extraordinary—things beyond the commonplace andthe natural. On the basis of this idea we would say that a religion is a system of beliefs and behaviorsthat deals with the relationship between humans and the sacred supernatural.The term supernaturalrefers to things that are “above the natural.” Supernatural entitiesand actions transcend the normal world of cause and effect as we know it. In the supernaturalworld, wondrous things occur. Supernatural beings defy the basic laws of nature. In the super-natural world, objects move faster than light, heavy objects fly, and creatures become invisible.However, not all supernatural phenomena are thought to be religious. Consider the folktalein which the handsome prince is turned into a frog. This is surely a supernatural occurrence—handsome princes do not turn into frogs in the natural world—but this occurrence is hardly areligious one. To address this problem, we add the term sacredto the definition of religion.Sacreddenotes an attitude wherein the subject is entitled to reverence and respect.Many theorists have defined religion in terms of the supernatural as the core religiousbeliefs of any religious system. In 1871, Edward Burnett Tylor defined religion as animism, abelief in spirit beings (gods, souls, ghosts, demons, etc.). Much later, Melford Spiro definedreligion as an “institution consisting of culturally patterned interactions with culturally postu-lated superhuman beings.”8The problem with an essentialist definition is that such definitions often become too specific,focusing narrowly on spirit beings for example, or risk being too vague if they only referencethe supernatural. As with other definitions we’ve looked at, essentialist definitions by themselvesmay not be enough but do point to areas of great importance in religion."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"16Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of ReligionA true understanding of the breadth of religious practices among the world’s societies willbecome clear as you progress through this text. We encourage you to keep an open mind andsettle on your own definition as you gain more knowledge and understanding. However, as wasdiscussed previously, as an endeavor in the social sciences, this text needs an operant definitionin order to proceed.One would like to have a simple definition of the term religion. However, the search for asimple, yet useful definition remains elusive. Religion is a concept constructed by the humanmind that includes a particular set of human beliefs and practices. As a cultural construct it isstrongly influenced by culture and by philosophical and theoretical backgrounds. The practicesthat are included under the rubric of religion vary from scholar to scholar, and definitions thatfocus upon religious systems found in large, urban societies differ considerably from those foundin small-scale societies. Each definition previously explored offers clues to important elementsof religion, but each by itself is incomplete.Perhaps it is best to think of religion as a set of cultural beliefs and practices that usuallyinclude some or all of a basic set of characteristics. While not an exhaustive list, it will provideus with an operant definition as we move ahead with our studies of religious systems. Thesecharacteristics are as follows:• A belief in anthropomorphic supernatural beings, such as spirits and gods.• A focus on the sacred supernatural, where sacred refers to a feeling of reverence and awe.• The presence of supernatural power or energy that is found in supernatural beings as wellas physical beings and objects.• The performance of ritual activities that involve the manipulation of sacred objects to com-municate with supernatural beings and/or to influence or control events.• An articulation of a worldview and moral code through narratives and other means.• Provides for the creation and maintenance of social bonds and mechanisms of social con-trol within a community; provides explanations for the unknown and a sense of control forthe individual.The Domain of ReligionThe discussion of definitions highlights the contrasting concepts of etic and emic. The veryconcept of religion as a separate cultural category is a Western one. Western cultures aredivided into very distinct cultural domains, such as economics, politics, technology, and, ofcourse, religion. As we move through our day, we move from one domain to another, yet thedomains do not overlap, or they overlap to a small degree. For example, when we go to work,we might punch a clock or sign in, for “work” is a distinct segment of our life, which we candefine in terms of location, activity, relationships to coworkers, and so forth. Religion as adomain may be restricted to very specific activities held in special places during specifictimes—a Sunday morning church service, for example. When we use the term religion, wemight immediately picture such things as special buildings dedicated to religious activities(churches, temples, and mosques) and full-time specialists who perform religious rituals(priests and rabbis).Our analysis of religion becomes more difficult when we turn our attention to more tradi-tional societies. If we analyzed small-scale religious systems by applying the definitions and con-cepts that have been developed in Western cultures, we would likely find that certain elements thatwe consider to be vital parts of our religious systems simply do not exist—in our terms. For somepeople it follows from this that other religious systems are “defective,” “incomplete,” “primitive,”"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion17“false,” or “full of superstitions.” Clearly, this leads us into highly ethnocentric conclusions thatcloud our ability to understand the religious systems of other peoples.When we study traditional societies using an emic (insider) approach, there might be noequivalent term to our concept of religion. Religion is not separated out from other dimensions oflife but is fully integrated into the fabric of beliefs and behavior. As Wilfred Cantwell Smithwrote, “To the believer, they are parts of the universe; to the observer, they are parts of a religion.”9Theoretical Approaches to the Study of ReligionJust as there are many definitions of religion, there are also many approaches to the study ofreligious phenomena. Here we will describe five approaches that anthropologists have used tostudy religion: evolutionary, Marxist, functional, interpretive, and psychosocial.THE EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH.The evolutionary approachwas centered on the questionsof when and how religion began. This viewpoint developed in the late 1800s when the focus wason the concepts of science, logic, and monotheism as the pinnacles of human achievement.Scholars of the time emphasized empiricism, or observing and measuring, saying that the onlyreal knowledge is scientific knowledge; any knowledge beyond that is impossible.The latter half of the nineteenth century saw the rise of the concept of a general evolution ofculture. It was thought that religion naturally evolved from the simple to the complex and that thisevolution was a natural consequence of human nature. An interest in the religion of “primitive”peoples arose from the supposition that “primitive” peoples represented an early stage of culturalevolution and that one could learn about and understand the historical roots of the religion of“civilized” societies by studying living “primitive” peoples.Edward B. Tylor used this approach in his book Primitive Culture(1871).10He concludedthat all religions had a belief in spiritual beings. Whereas the religions of “civilized” peoplesincluded beliefs in gods and souls, those of “primitive” peoples focused on the belief in spiritsand ghosts. He termed this early belief system animism.Tylor thought that the belief in spirit beings was the natural and universal conclusionreached by all peoples through the observation of sleep and dreams, possession, and death, duringwhich the soul is thought to leave the body, temporarily or permanently. Because other animalsare also living, they must also have souls that leave the body when the animal dies. All livingthings are animated by souls, as are nonliving things such as waterfalls and mountains.In attempting to find a common thread in all religious systems, Tylor failed to discover thegreat variability among the world’s religious systems. This was in part because Tylor did not gointo the field to become immersed in the complexity of a particular culture. Instead, he relied onreports of explorers, missionaries, and colonial administrators who described, often in simplisticand biased ways, the peoples they encountered in their travels.Robert R. Marett developed the concept of a simpler, more basic, and more ancient super-natural force that he labeled animatism.11Marett thought that the idea of animatism simply grewout of human emotional reaction to the power of nature. This belief in an impersonal supernaturalpower is well articulated in the religions of Polynesia and Melanesia, where it is referred to asmana. In Chapter 7 we will discuss the ideas of another scholar from the evolutionary school,James Frazer, who wrote extensively about magic, a category that he considered to be separatefrom religion. Frazer saw a natural progression in cultures from magic to religion to science.12The evolutionary approach has many critics. Many of the ideas found in this school ofthought are ethnocentric—for example, Tylor’s idea that the religion of “primitive” peoples focused"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religionon spirits and ghosts while more “civilized” peoples focused on gods. In addition, any ideas aboutthe origin of a cultural practice are, of course, highly speculative. Although the idea of cultural pro-gression, with Western societies being more “evolved” than smaller-scale traditional ones, is nolonger used in anthropology, the general question of the origins of religion has remained a concern.However, many contemporary anthropologists use an evolutionary approach. After all, thehistory of human society has witnessed progressive changes through time from foraging tohorticultural to agricultural and, finally, industrial societies. Scholars look for correlationsbetween these changes and various aspects of a society, including religious system. For example,foraging societies are often characterized by shamanic practices with part-time religious practi-tioners while on the other hand, state societies are characterized by full-time religious specialistswho may be members of a highly organized priesthood.THE MARXIST APPROACH.Another influential theorist of the 1800s was Karl Marx. Like manyof this era, Marx was critical of religion. However, Marx did not criticize the logic of religion asothers had done. He felt that religion reflected society so that any criticism of religion must there-fore also be a criticism of society. Indeed his approach to religion cannot be understood withoutthe framework of his approach to society. Marx saw religion as being a human construction, morespecifically as a construction of those in power.Marx felt that religion did not reflect the true consciousness of people but a false con-sciousness designed to divert people’s attention from the miseries of their lives. This miserywas seen as being the result of exploitation of the masses by those in power under the capitalistsystem. Of course, religion existed before capitalism and Marx’s basic view is that religion is anatural consequence of the human experience of distress. In the past, this may have arisen as aresult of the human struggle with nature. However, Marx’s focus is on the capitalist system inwhich this struggle has shifted to human conflict with other humans. Religion is seen both as ameans of compensation and as a way of getting people to go along with a capitalist culture thatis not in their best interests. For example, he felt that religion teaches people to be obedient toauthority as a condition for achieving future happiness through salvation:13Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress and the protestagainst real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of aheartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of thepeople. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is requiredfor their real happiness. The demand to give up the illusion about its condition is thedemand to give up a condition which needs illusions.Critics of Marx point out that there usually is no single, dominant ideology in a society; instead,there are different ideologies that correspond to different subcultures and different classes.THE FUNCTIONAL APPROACH.In contrast to the evolutionary and Marxist schools, thefunctional approachasks the question: What does religion do? What role do religions play in asociety? For example, a religion might enforce social cohesion by bringing members together forrituals and providing a foundation for shared beliefs. Religions might also function on the indi-vidual level to relieve individual anxiety by providing explanations and meaning.Émile Durkheim, for example, saw society as problematic.14Although sanctions exist tokeep people in line, Durkheim thought that these were not enough. He believed that the key lies inthe collective conscious, a system of beliefs that act to contain natural selfishness of individuals"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion19and to promote social cooperation. Collective representations, or symbols, are a reflection of thecollective conscious. During rituals, these collective representations are displayed, resulting in areattachment to the value system of the group.Both Durkheim and Alfred R. Radcliffe-Brown saw society as being like an organism inwhich the parts act to maintain the whole.15Radcliffe-Brown also thought that for society to sur-vive, certain feelings need to be encouraged in people’s minds. He thought that anything of greatsocial value is seen as possessing supernatural power; the greater the value, the more powerful itis. Rituals, then, function to express the basic sentiments of a society and to pass these ideas downfrom generation to generation. Religion, in general, is seen as an integrative force in society.Radcliffe-Brown’s approach to function was in terms of a part contributing to the mainte-nance of the whole society. Another important theorist in the functional school, BronislawMalinowski, had a different approach (Box 1.2). Malinowski looked at religion and otherBOX 1.2Malinowski and the Trobriand IslandsBronislaw Malinowski was born into the nobility in Krakow, Poland, in 1884. He studied mathe-matics and physical sciences and received his Ph.D. from the University of Krakow in 1908.However, illness prevented him from continuing his research, and while recovering, he read theThe Golden Boughby James Frazer, a classic anthropological work that describes magical beliefsin cultures around the world. Malinowski later wrote in 1926, “no sooner had I begun to read thisgreat work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it.”aReading this book changed his life.From then on, Malinowski devoted himself to the study of anthropology, and he traveled toEngland to study at the London School of Economics.In 1914, Malinowski joined an expedition to the Pacific. He would not return to Europe until1920 because, being a Polish subject, he was considered to be an enemy alien by the British duringWorld War I. However, during the war he was allowed to continue his research in the Pacific and tospend the time between expeditions in Australia. Because of these circumstances, Malinowskispent a greater amount of time conducting field research than had ever been done before. Thisincluded a total of twenty-six months spent in the Trobriand Islands, located off the coast ofNew Guinea.During his stay in the Trobriand Islands, Malinowski completed the most detailed anthropo-logical study that had been done up to that time, and the Trobriand Islands remains one of themost fully described of any small-scale society. Unlike other anthropologists of his day, Malinowskiparticipated in the life of the society he was studying. He pitched his tent in the middle of thevillage and learned the language. Malinowski was a pioneer of the participant observationmethod that became a hallmark of the field of anthropology.Malinowski became a major figure in the development of British anthropology and influ-enced nearly everyone who trained in the field during the 1920s and 1930s. Among his pioneeringcontributions was the concept of functionalism. He thought that culture does something—thatsocial institutions exist to fulfill the needs of, and serve the interests of, members of a society.aB. Malinowski, Magic, Science and Religion and Other Essays(Garden City, NY: Anchor Books, 1948), p. 94."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religionfeatures of a society in terms of their purpose in meeting basic human needs. For example, in hisanalysis of magic, Malinowski stressed that magic is a logical system that people turn to in timesof uncertainty or emotional stress. Magic functions to provide control and certainty in an other-wise uncertain world.The functional approach is still used today and will be referred to in future chapters.Researchers have recognized many phenomena that we will address as contributing to the healthand maintenance of the society or the individuals in that group. In general, religious phenomenafunction to provide answers and explanations and to provide a course of action.The functional school is not without its critics. Some see functionalism as committingthe error of reification (treating something abstract as if it were concrete and alive). Can we reallytalk about social institutions having needs and purposes in the same way that humans do?Functionalism is also seen by some as being tautological (a circular argument) because it arguesthat we know that something must be functional because it exists; it exists because it is functional.Does every institution and cultural practice have a function? Historians of religion argue thatanalyzing religion in terms of functionality implies that religion is purely illusory, existing only tofulfill those functions. For instance, some functionalists see religion as just a crutch for the massesor a power play by the ruling class. Instead, historians of religion emphasize a powerful and livedexperience of a sacred reality.Others argue that while the functional approach is useful, more care needs to be taken interms of which possible functions are logically valid. For example, Melford Spiro states that whenarguing that a certain function is the cause of a religious behavior, it is necessary for individuals toboth recognize and seek to satisfy that functional requirement. He argues that an unintended func-tional consequence (recognized only by outsiders) could not possibly be its cause.THE INTERPRETIVE APPROACH.Clifford Geertz was an American anthropologist who popu-larized the metaphor that culture is a text to be read and in which anthropologists can readmeaning.16Part of his inspiration for this was the work of the sociologist Max Weber and hisconcept of verstehen(i.e., understanding the other’s point of view).17This Weberian approachwas opposed to the more popular functionalist approach of the time. Geertz emphasized that thetask of anthropologists was not to discover laws or study origins and causes but instead tomake sense of cultural systems by studying meaning. Anthropologists need to seek to interpretthe culturally specific “webs of significance” that people both create and are caught up in.Interpretive anthropology can discover and interpret these webs of meaning through detailedethnographic descriptions.Religion specifically is described as a cluster of symbols that together make up a wholeand provides a charter for a culture’s ideas, values, and way of life. The set of symbols providesways to interpret the world. Geertz described symbols as playing a double role. They are both“models of” and “models for” in that they both represent the way things are while also directinghuman activity. Geertz argued that religious symbols establish very powerful moods and feelingsand help explain human existence by giving it an ultimate meaning. These symbols claim to con-nect humans to a reality that in some ways is “more real” than everyday life, thus giving religiona special status above and beyond regular life.Geertz felt that the study of religion needed to take place in two stages. The firststage is an analysis of the systems of meaning that are embodied within religious symbols.The second stage involves relating these systems to social structures and psychologicalprocesses. Critics point out that in reality he devoted much more time to the first stagethan to the second."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion21THE PSYCHOSOCIAL APPROACH.The psychosocial approachto the study of religion isconcerned with the relationship between culture and personality and the connection betweenthe society and the individual. One example is the work of Sigmund Freud.18Freud’s modelof the mind and his concept of defense mechanisms have been used both by Freud himselfand by his followers to explain religious phenomena. For example, defense mechanisms arepsychological maneuvers by which we distort reality in ways that help us to avoid conflictand reduce anxiety. The most important of these for our discussion is projection, in whichthe subject is transposed and the emotion is projected. So “I hate X” becomes “You hate X.”Psychosocial anthropologists believe that individual emotions also get projected at the cul-tural level.The best example of this is studies that look cross-culturally for correlations betweenvarious beliefs and behaviors. One example of this approach uses this methodology tohypothesize a connection between the characteristics of parents and the characteristics ofsupernatural beings. Childhood experiences are dominated by powerful figures—parents.Children build up parental images that stay with them throughout life. In adult life theseparental images are projected onto spirit beings. For example, if parents are generally nurtur-ing, the expectation is that the gods would be considered to be nurturing as well. However,correlation does not equal causation, and this and several other issues challenge the correla-tional approach.BOX 1.3Evans-Pritchard and the AzandeE. E. Evans-Pritchard was born in Sussex, England, in 1902. After receiving his master’s degree inAnthropology from Oxford University, he went on to study at the University of London, where hebecame one of Malinowski’s first students. He conducted several field expeditions to Central, East,and North Africa from 1926 until the beginning of World War II. During the war he left teachingand research to join the military. After the war he returned to academia and ultimately held theposition of chair of Social Anthropology at Oxford University.Evans-Pritchard is best known for his work with the Azande of southern Sudan, which wasthen the British colony of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Between 1926 and 1930 he made three differ-ent visits and spent a total of twenty months among the Azande. Following his work with theAzande, he went on to study the Nuer. He had found the Azande to be friendly, but his work withthe Nuer was much more difficult. In the early days of his research in particular, they were hostileand uncommunicative, and he was frequently ill.The Azande are known today as the classic anthropological example of witchcraft in asmall-scale society. Evans-Pritchard’s early articles on the subject were greatly influenced by thefunctional perspective of his teacher, Malinowski. For example, Evans-Pritchard believed thatwitchcraft beliefs provided explanations for events and helped to uphold moral standards (seeChapter 10). Ultimately, however, he was not satisfied with this type of explanation alone. Heemphasized the importance of looking at beliefs and behaviors from an insider perspective andwanted to show how even seemingly irrational beliefs were in fact logical and coherent from theemic perspective."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of ReligionThe Biological Basis of Religious BehaviorWhat we perceive and think of as our reality is actually a creation of our brain. Our awareness ofwhat is “out there” is based upon input from a series of receptors such as our eyes, nose, andtongue. The stimuli that are picked up by these receptors enter the brain, where they undergo pro-cessing before they enter our consciousness. For example, the clear, detailed, three-dimensional,colored world revealed through sight is an illusion created by our brain from a hodgepodge ofelectrical impulses created by the photoreceptors in the retina of our eyes. Color is a completeillusion of something that does not exist in the real world, but is our brain’s way of representingdifferences in the wavelength of electromagnetic energy.And not all of the information that enters our brain from the outside enters our conscious-ness. For example, there was a patient who was blind because of a series of strokes that com-pletely destroyed the visual cortex of his brain; his eyes and optic nerves, however, remainedhealthy. Information entering the brain from his eyes was used by his brain to permit him to walkdown a hallway full of objects on the floor without stepping on them. His brain knew where theobjects were even though his consciousness did not.19This then brings up the question: Does our brain create realities that are indistinguishablefrom “reality,” whatever that means? An important part of religion is religious experiences, whichrange from feeling good to hallucinations and revelations. Could, for example, seeing a ghost,having an out-of-body experience, or being visited by an angel be examples of brain-created real-ities? The answer is yes.Figure 1.2 shows a pair of brain scans that compare brains at rest with brains of individualsin deep meditation. The bright areas are regions that are active during particular mental activities.In the meditating brain, we see an increase in activity in the frontal lobe, indicative of increasedconcentration, and a decrease in activity in the parietal lobe. This latter area is in the region asso-ciated with people’s orientation of their bodies in time and space. Changes in activity in this areamay be related to the development of out-of-body experiences or to a sense of blurring of theboundaries between self and other. In another interesting area of research, it has been found thatpatients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy, when the functioning of the brain goes haywire,report their seizures as intense religious experiences.It is tempting to associate religious feelings and experiences with a particular point within thestructure of the brain—a God module perhaps. However, most neuroscientists who are interested inthese issues see religious experiences as more complex, involving changes in many differentregions of the brain.Considering biological influences is a part of anthropology’s holistic approach. It is some-thing we will consider as we discuss phenomena such as altered states of consciousness andnear-death experiences.BELIEFS IN SPIRIT BEINGS.Another aspect of the biological basis for religion is the impactof the way the human mind works. An interesting application of this is a phenomenon thatappears to be common to all human religious systems, concepts of supernatural anthropomor-phic causal agents within their environment. (The term anthropomorphicrefers to things thatare not human but have humanlike characteristics and behave in humanlike ways.) This isthe core of the concept of animism, the belief in spirit beings, which was introduced earlier inthis chapter.One explanation for the development of a belief in spirit beings is based on the conceptof theory of mind.

People recognize and often identify withperceived feelings, desires, fears, and other emotions in other human beings. The presence ofa theory of mind is thought to be what makes us human, although evidence suggests that theremay be some development of theory of mind in other animals, albeit on a very limited scale.This is what allows people to explain other peoples’ behavior and to predict what others willdo in a particular situation. Thus a theory of mind is essential for the development of complexsocial patterns.Many scholars believe that the human brain actually extends the theory of mind into the mindof animals and other living and nonliving entities. It is this extension that leads to anthropomorphismFrontal LobesFrontal LobesBaselineMeditationBaselineParietal LobeMeditationParietal Lobe"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religionand attribution of humanlike qualities to animals. The idea that nonhuman entities and forces possess“minds,” that they have intensions, emotions, and interact with the human world, is the basis for thedevelopment of a belief in spirit beings.If anthropomorphic supernatural beings interact with the human world, then things do nothappen simply because they follow the rules of nature. This explains why things occur that lieoutside rational analysis. And this also provides the means, through ritual, to influence andperhaps to control nature.THE EVOLUTION OF RELIGION.With the emerging interest in biology and religion, newexplanations for the origin of religion have been proposed that look at the question from theperspective of biological evolution. If humans have a biological mechanism for religion, whydid it evolve?Evolutionary explanations are actually not all that different from the functional, needs-fulfillment explanations we discussed earlier. Some evolutionary scientists have suggested thatreligion evolved as a way to fulfill social needs such as encouraging cooperation between indi-viduals, reinforcing kinship ties, and imposing order and stability on society. Others havefocused on emotional needs and have argued that as humans became more intelligent and self-aware, anxiety would have been a natural response. Once we are aware that we exist, webecome aware that we will die and therefore begin to worry about dying. The evolution ofgreater awareness and consciousness would create a dysfunctional, anxiety-ridden species ifreligion had not evolved as an adaptation to cope with this by providing explanations of andmeanings for both life and death.Other theorists have focused on the nature of human cognitionas an explanation for theorigin of religious beliefs and experiences. (Cognitionis a general term for processes of thehuman brain that include perception, learning, memory, concept formation, and problem solving.)Religion is seen not as existing to serve a purpose but rather as an accidental by-product of theway the human brain works.The human brain appears to have two different and innate ways of interpreting theworld. One has to do with physical things like rocks, the other with psychological things, suchas people. We interpret a rock moving through space and a person moving through space verydifferently. To a person we attribute such things as intentions, beliefs, goals, and morality orlack thereof. These two systems seem to be biological adaptations that help us to deal withobjects and with people. However, these systems go awry in ways that provide the foundationfor religion.For example, we are dualists; we see mind and body as two separate and distinct entities.Despite what psychologists know about how the brain works, we intuitively feel that we merelyoccupy our bodies, not that we actually are our bodies. This provides the foundation for a beliefin both bodies without souls and souls without bodies. A dead body is seen as lacking its soul.The soul without the body is often believed to survive and have another, separate existence afterdeath. A further extension of souls without bodies would also include other supernatural beings,such as gods.The second way in which cognition feeds into the evolution of religion is the human ten-dency to overextend our system of social understanding and infer purpose, goals, intention, anddesign even where there is none. We attribute human characteristics to an amazing range ofinanimate objects as, for example, the computer that seems to purposely break down at the mostcrucial moment. Humans seek and find patterns in random arrays—what looks like a face in astucco ceiling or the Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese sandwich."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religion25Pascal Boyer has pointed out that although religious concepts do violate some expectationsabout the world, they do preserve other expectations. He focuses in particular on the social natureof human beings and the inferences that the human brain draws that regulate social interaction.For example, Boyer points out that gods and other supernatural agents are seen as being veryhuman-like in cultures around the world. Yet there are obviously crucial differences. Boyerpoints out that gods differ from human in that they have access to all the possible informationthat is relevant to the issue at hand in a social interaction.However, gods are rarely omniscient cross-culturally. For example, the idea that “Godknows you are lying” seems more natural than “God knows the content of every refrigerator inthe world”—unless in your refrigerator is something that you stole. The main point of Boyer’sdiscussion is that supernatural concepts are just extensions of everyday cognitive categories andthe way that the human brain processes information. As he writes, “People do not invent godsand spirits; they receive information that leads them to build such concepts.”20CONCLUSIONAs we have seen in our discussion of the definition of religion and different approaches to thestudy of religion, ethnocentrism can be and has been a major impediment to developing a trueunderstanding of religious beliefs and practices in other societies. The goal of anthropology is tomove past ethnocentrism toward an approach of cultural relativism. This is especially true in thestudy of religion. The anthropological approach—and the central way of looking at the religiousworld in this book—is to study what people believe and do in regard to a sacred supernatural, notto judge whether these beliefs and actions are based in an objective truth or not. The anthropo-logical study of religion calls for a methodological agnosticism.Although agnosticismhas taken on the connotation of not having made up one’s mind, theoriginal meaning of the word is different. Agnostics say that the nature of the supernatural isunknowable, that it is as impossible to prove the nonexistence of the supernatural as it is to prove itsexistence. In this book we will be seeking neither to prove nor to disprove but merely to observe. Inthe words of the philosopher Baruch Spinoza, writing in the seventeenth century, “I have made aceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them.”SummaryAnthropology is the study of humanity. Anthro-pologists study human societies as integratedwholes, an approach that is termed holism. Thisapproach is seen in the broad scope of anthro-pology, which is often divided into the fields ofphysical anthropology, archaeology, linguistics,and cultural anthropology. This approachrequires that societies be studied over long peri-ods of time, during which the investigator liveswithin the community and participates in thelives of the people under study, a techniqueknown as participant observation. The finalproduct is an ethnography, a descriptive study ofa human society.An outside observer of a community usuallyimposes his or her system of analysis on the groupunder study (etic perspective). It is natural to useone’s own society as the basis for interpreting andjudging other societies, a tendency called ethno-centrism. Many anthropologists attempt to see theworld through the eyes of the people being studied(emic perspective) and describe and understandpeople’s customs and ideas but do not judge them,an approach called cultural relativism. The goal is"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26Chapter 1 • The Anthropological Study of Religionto study what people believe, not whether or notwhat they believe is true.A central concept in anthropology is culture.In 1871, Tylor wrote, “Culture . . . is that complexwhole, which includes knowledge, belief, art,morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities andhabits acquired by man as a member of society.”Culture includes all aspects of the human experiencethat are passed down from generation to generation.Culture gives meaning to reality; we live in a real,physical world, but our minds interpret this worldthrough a cultural lens and even create new realities.Religion is a difficult concept to definewhen we try to include all human societies. Ananalytic definition focuses on the way in whichreligion manifests itself or is expressed in a cul-ture. A functional definition is concerned with therole that religion plays in a society. Finally, anessentialist definition looks at what the essentialnature of religion is and emphasizes the fact thatreligion is the domain of the extraordinary. Ourdefinition looks at religion as a set of culturalbeliefs and practices that usually include a basicset of characteristics and draws on elements of allthree of these approaches.There have been many theoretical approachesto the study of religion. The evolutionary approach,developed in the late 1800s, focused on the ques-tions of when and how religions began and howthey evolved from the simple to the complex. Thisevolution was seen as a natural consequence ofhuman nature, and the religions of “primitive”peoples were remnants of an earlier, simpler evolu-tionary stage. Early religions included animism, thebelief in spirits and ghosts, and animatism, thebelief in a generalized supernatural force.The Marxist approach is based on the writ-ings of Karl Marx, who saw religion as being aconstruction of those in power, designed to divertpeople’s attention from the miseries of theirlives. This misery was seen as being the result ofexploitation of the masses by those in powerunder the capitalist system. He saw religion bothas a means of compensation and as a way of get-ting people to go along with a capitalist culturethat is not in their best interests.The functional approach asks the ques-tion: What does religion do? For example,Malinowski concluded that magic functions toprovide control and certainty in an otherwiseuncertain situation. The interpretive approach isassociated with Clifford Geertz who believedthat the task of anthropologists was to makesense of cultural systems by studying meaning.He described religion as a cluster of symbols thatprovides a charter for a culture’s ideas, values,and way of life. Religious symbols help explainhuman existence by giving it an ultimate mean-ing. The psychosocial approach is concernedwith the relationship between culture and person-ality and the connection between the society andthe individual.Many theorists have suggested that religionis a by-product of the functioning and evolution ofthe human brain. The brain is capable of creatingnew realities. The theory of mind is the idea thatone knows what is going on in another person’smind. This leads to the attribution of humanlikequalities to nonhuman entities and forces, the basisfor the development of a belief in spirit beings.Thus we infer purpose, goals, intention, and designthroughout the universe.Suggested ReadingsPascal Boyer, Religion Explained: The EvolutionaryOrigins of Religious Thought(New York: BasicBooks, 2001).[A cognitive anthropologist explains religion interms of everyday thought processes.]David J.

How would this be different from astudy on a specific topic?2.We can examine human societies from an etic or anemic perspective. Do you think it is possible toreally understand a society other than your ownfrom an emic perspective?3.How would you balance cultural relativism anduniversal human rights? Do you think that youcould remain neutral in your judgment of all of thebehaviors you might see in a small-scale society?4.What is the basic difference between a society anda culture? Can these two terms be used inter-changeably?5.Think back to a ritual that you have attended—awedding ceremony, for example. Write three briefdescriptions from each of the following view-points: analytic, functional, and essentialist.6.One of the major debates in studies of humanbehavior is that between nature (biology) andnurture (culture). Do you think that there is anybiological basis for the development of religion inhuman societies? Do you think that somedaysomeone might discover a society that has no reli-gious practices?7.Some scholars have argued that religion is notdefinable in any real sense. Ludwig Wittgensteinwrote: “We sometimes demand definitions for thesake not of their content, but of their form. Ourrequirement is an architectural one; the definition akind of ornamental coping that supports nothing.”21Discuss.Endnotes1.

Myths are religiousnarratives or stories that provide the basis for religious beliefs and practices. Mythstell of the origins and history of the world and the creation of the first human beings.They also prescribe the rules of proper conduct and articulate the ethical and moral principles ofsociety. Some myths exist as written texts, whereas in nonliterate societies they exist as oralnarratives. Religious stories also can be told in art, music, and dance. In this chapter, we will dis-cuss the nature of myths and provide several examples of myths from various religious systems.THE NATURE OF MYTHSAs we learned in Chapter 1, the lives and experiences of a people are seen through a cultural lensthat imposes meaning on their world. Within this world all people have a body of knowledgewithin which many things are understood and controlled. However, all people also experiencethings that they cannot comprehend and cannot control. They ponder the origin of their world.They seek to understand the interconnectedness between humanity and the world around them,including the physical landscape, the plants and animals that dwell in this landscape, and otherhuman beings and societies. And they question the existence and meaning of disaster, illness,and death.WorldviewThe way in which societies perceive and interpret their reality is known as their worldview.Their worldview provides them with an understanding of how their world works; it forms thetemplate for thought and behavior; and it provides them with a basic understanding of the originand nature of humankind and their relationship to the world around them.To better understand the concept of worldview, we can compare the worldviews of twocultures, Navaho and Judeo-Christian. The Navaho today are the largest Native American groupin the United States. They occupy a large reservation in Arizona and New Mexico, althoughtoday many Navaho have left the reservation and live elsewhere.To the Navaho, nature exists and humans are a part of nature. The Navaho see their worldin terms of the relationships and connections that bind the various elements that make up the2"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"world. All of these elements—the land, the plants, the animals, people, and the gods—are boundtogether into a systematic and balanced whole. All of the elements within the universe affect oneanother, existing in a state of harmony.For the universe to function—to maintain its harmonious state—people must behave prop-erly as defined by Navaho culture. Failure to behave properly brings about disharmony in theuniverse, and this disharmony can lead to natural disaster, illness, and even death. The goal of aNavaho is to remain in harmony with the universe or, as they like to put it, to “walk in beauty.”Whereas Navaho culture sees humans as one cog in the natural world, Judeo-Christianssee their world quite differently. Here humans occupy a very special place in the universe. Thefollowing is from the Eighth Psalm:What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned himwith glory and honor.Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast putall things under his feet:All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;The fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea, and whatsoever passeth throughthe paths of the seas.It is clear here that the world was created for the benefit of humankind and that humankindhas the authority, the right, to exploit the natural world. This active relationship with nature isseen in attempts to control nature—through dams and irrigation projects, for example. Whereasthe Navaho sees illness as a manifestation of disharmony and attempts to bring resolution of theillness through ritual designed to reestablish harmony, the Judeo-Christian seeks the empiricalcause and then, through medical technology, proceeds to “fix it.”Stories of the SupernaturalPeople describe their world and express their worldview in stories and other creative expressions.This includes modes as diverse as art, drama, jokes, writing on the walls of public bathrooms,folk music, and festivals. Here we will focus on stories that are told about the supernaturalworld.The following is a story that is European in origin and was first published in 1823, writtendown from oral presentations. It has been told and retold countless times and is probably familiarto the reader in some form. It is the story of Snow White.1The story of Snow Whiteinvolves an evil queen who flies into a jealous ragewhenever she learns that someone in the kingdom is more beautiful than she. Shekeeps tabs on her status in the beauty arena by using a talking mirror. This is atype of divination instrument (see Chapter 7) that can be used to gather informationabout things and events in ways that are supernatural. (Certainly, one would have toagree that talking mirrors do not exist in our empirical, rational world.)Snow White is the evil queen’s stepdaughter. As Snow White matures, sheeventually becomes more beautiful than the queen, who sees Snow White as a threatthat must be eliminated. The queen orders Snow White killed, but the huntsman whois ordered to do the killing takes pity on Snow White and lets her escape into the30Chapter 2 • Mythology"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"forest. The huntsman then kills a wild boar and presents its lungs and liver to thequeen as being Snow White’s. The evil queen cooks and eats the lungs and liver,thinking them to be those of her dead stepdaughter. This is an example of ritualcannibalism. Perhaps the queen believes that by eating the remains of her rival, theelements of beauty in Snow White will pass to her.Thus Snow White escapes and moves in with seven dwarfs. The evil queen,learning through her magic mirror that Snow White is still alive, finally kills her witha poison apple. After many years Snow White is discovered by a prince who, onkissing her, brings her back to life.When we read the story of Snow White, it is clearly a story told for entertainment, primarilyfor children. However, like many such stories, it also provides a moral lesson. In this case weare told of the evils of envy and jealousy and what can happen to someone who exhibits theseattributes. (In one early version of the story the evil queen is invited to the wedding celebration ofSnow White and the Prince. Her evil deeds are revealed and she is made to put on a pair of red-hotiron slippers. She dances until she dies.)Yet although this story talks about moral issues and contains many supernatural elements(the magic mirror, for example), no one would classify it as a religious story. The dwarfs are notsacred; the mirror is not holy; the resurrection of the beautiful maiden does not elevate her to thestatus of deity. The story does not relate the actions of any gods; it is not the basis for religiousrituals; there are no churches or temples dedicated to Snow White. Adults do not believe thestory of Snow White to be true.Stories such as Snow Whiteare meant to entertain; these are called folktales. Folktales takeplace in a fictional world. They include supernatural elements and frequently contain a moral.Folktales usually exist independent of time and space. (Where was the kingdom in which SnowWhite lived located? How long ago did the story take place?)In contrast to folktales, legendsare seen by members of the culture as representing eventsthat have actually taken place, although some embellishment often occurs. Legends take place inthe comparatively recent past and tell not only of such things as migrations, wars, heroes, andkings but also of local stories about buried treasure, ghosts, and saints. They may or may notinclude supernatural elements and may or may not be considered sacred. Legends you may befamiliar with include the cities of Atlantis and El Dorado, the heroes Robin Hood and KingArthur, and the story of the Holy Grail.Legends are commonplace in our contemporary world, although people seldom see themas such. Known as urban legends, these stories are recounted as having really happened,primarily on the Internet or in tabloids. Some commonly circulated urban legends are the story ofthe woman who dried her dog in a microwave, crocodiles living in the sewers of New York City,and strangers giving out poisonous candy at Halloween.MYTHS.Mythsare sacred stories. They tell of the origin of the world and humankind, theexistence and activities of gods and spirits, the creation of order in the universe, and the nature ofillness and death. Myths relate the origins of human traditions and articulate a society’s valuesand norms. They tell how to behave and distinguish good from evil.Myths are thought by the people who tell them to recount real events that took place in theremote past in a world different from the one we live in now. Myths, however, are believed to berelevant to modern life and are often recounted in religious rituals. Lauri Honko writes:2Chapter 2 • Mythology31"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"32Chapter 2 • MythologyTABLE 2.1Forms of NarrativeFolktalesLegendsMythsRegarded as fiction; notconsidered to be sacred;meant to entertainBased on real people,places, or events and areconsidered to be factualRegarded as fact; accepted on faith; source of authority on moral and ethical issuesInclude supernaturalelements, yet are secularInclude few if anysupernatural elements; canbe sacred or secularInclude a great many supernatural elements; areconsidered to be sacredCharacters are human and/ornonhumanCharacters are generallyhumanCharacters are human andnonhumanExist independent of time andplaceTake place in the present orrecent past; in the modernworldTake place in the remote past in another world or in an earlier manifestation of today’s worldThe reenactment of a creative event, for example, the healing wrought by a god inthe beginning of time, is the common aim of myth and ritual. In this way the event istransferred to the present and its result, i.e. the healing of a sick person, can beachieved once more here and now. In this way, too, the world order, which wascreated in the primeval era and which is reflected in myths, preserves its value as anexemplar and model for the people of today.Although the term mythis frequently used in our society in a negative sense to mean stories that are false or only told by primitive peoples, that is not the sense in which we use theterm here. Anthropologists and folklorists use the term to refer to sacred religious stories that arebelieved by the people who tell them to be true. In this sense, the stories of the Bible are myths,as are the writings of the Qur’an.This analytic distinction between different types of narratives is one that is also made bymany cultural groups. For example, Trobriand Islanders distinguish between kukwanebu(fairytales, fictional stories told after dark for amusement), libwogwo(legends, stories told to impartknowledge and believed to be true), and liliu(sacred stories told during the preparation forreligious rituals). Many societies distinguish between true stories (myths and legends) andstories that are a lie or a joke (a folktale). The distinctions between folktales, legends, and mythsare summarized in Table 2.1.The Nature of Oral TextsMyths can be oral or written. In literate societies, written texts may form the basis of scholarlydiscourse and analysis as well as ritual. In nonliterate societies and in many literate societies aswell, texts are recited. Recitation is much more than a simple rote presentation of the text—recitation is performance. In reciting the text, a person might speak in a manner that is not foundin everyday speech. Costumes, facial expressions, body postures, and changes in the qualityof the voice, all serve to create an experience. In some societies we find specialists—actors andstorytellers—who memorize and recite texts."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 • Mythology33Oral texts are frequently very long and complex. They are not always recited as a single,complete narrative and might not even be seen as a single entity. Particular segments might berecited at certain times in particular circumstances.One of the consequences of the oral transmission of stories is that they are frequentlyunconsciously altered with each generation. As a result of this learning process, different versionsof the same myth can exist in different families or groups within a society. For example, there areseveral versions of the Navaho creation story. Each was collected by a different anthropologistworking with a different elder. Although they have much in common, there are major differences.Myths may also change to account for new circumstances or events. Gregory Bateson gavean example from Bali of the development of a new myth that blended several previous stories.The new myth linked certain gods as siblings in order to provide a ritual basis for differentsociopolitical groups coming together.3Raymond Firth studied the Tikopia (Polynesia culture areas). He recorded differentversions of a myth about the building of the Rasofiroki Temple, a building that was thought toexist on both a material and spiritual plane.4The actual building that could be seen by humanswas believed to have a prototype in the heavens that was built by a group of sibling gods. In aversion recorded by Firth in 1929, the Great God, the oldest of the siblings, asks his brothers tohand up iron nails for the building of the temple. However, the brothers only hand up coconuthusk and cord. When they are done, the Great God came down, took the iron, and went off to theland of the white man. In a second version, the temple was built in England and the seniorbrother calls out in English for his brothers to hand up the iron. His brothers cannot understandthis foreign language, so they keep handing up coconut-based materials. When the building isdone, the senior brother drives them away in disgust and they go to Tikopia in a canoe. Iron wasa relatively recent introduction to Tikopia and the myth of the building of the temple appears tohave changed not only to accommodate this new material but also to account for why theEuropeans had this material but the Tikopians did not.If myths are written, however, the narratives that are transmitted from generation to genera-tion tend to be very stable through time, especially if they are not translated into other languages.An example of a written text is the Qur’an, which forms the foundation of Islam. Muslims believethat the Qur’an represents the word of God as revealed to Mohammad by the archangel Gabriel inthe early seventh century. It was spoken to Mohammad and was initially handed down orallybut was soon set down in written form. As the spoken word of God, verses from the Qur’an arerecited and memorized by devout Muslims. Because the Qur’an was revealed to Mohammadin Arabic, it is learned and memorized in Arabic throughout the Islamic world. (Of course, trans-lations of the Qur’an do exist, but they are not used in ritual. Commentaries on the Qur’an aremade in the local language.) Because printing presses produce millions of copies of this text, allidentical in content, the exact text not only is found throughout the world, but also is transmittedunchanged generation after generation. For Muslims, this lack of change is particularly important.Muslims believe that the true text exists in heaven and was given to Mohammad throughrevelations, which he memorized perfectly word for word. Thus the Qur’an (the word actuallymeans “recitation”) represents a perfect transcription of God’s vision and should not change.GENESIS.Many written texts have their origins in oral narratives. For example, the OldTestament probably had its origins in oral narratives that were eventually written down.Folklorist Alan Dundes points out that written texts that are derived from oral narrativesfrequently incorporate more than one version of a particular story.5For example, the OldTestament opens with two creation stories (Box 2.1)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34Chapter 2 • MythologyBOX 2.1GenesisGenesis (1:1–2:3)In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.And the earth was without form and void; darkness was upon the face of the deep.

The story begins with the worldcovered with water (“And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters”). God shapes theworld over a period of six days, resting on the seventh. The order of creation of living things isplants, followed by animals, followed by male and female human beings together (“male andfemale created he them”). This story is from what biblical scholars call the P or priestlydocument. It was probably written before 586 B.C.E. It contains many parallels with the Enumaelish,a Mesopotamian myth, and establishes the origin and sacred importance of the Sabbath.The second story is found in Genesis 2:4–2:10 and 2:15–2:23. At the beginning of thestory, the world was a desert (“for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth”). Godfirst “formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into nostrils the breath of life.” Heplaces a man, called Adam, in the Garden of Eden. God then forms all the animals and bringsthem to Adam one at a time to be named. Finally, God creates woman, called Eve, from Adam’srib. This story comes from what is referred to as the J document. It was likely written earlier thanthe first story, sometime between 960 and 915 B.C.E.The stories of Genesis are reflections of the Judeo-Christian worldview. They are verypatriarchal in many ways. For example, woman (Eve) is derived from man (Adam). In manyWestern societies, men dominate woman, and many positions of authority, such as the priest-hood, are restricted to men. Here the religious text is acting as a social charterthat explains theproper organization of human relationships.Genesis also expresses the Judeo-Christian worldview with respect to nature. This world-view appears to be based on two assumptions. The first is that the universe is mechanistic andhumans are its master. The second is that humans are a categorically different form of creaturethan all other forms of life.Changes do occur in written texts, but they are usually deliberate changes that are theconsequences of translation or scholarly discourse over the meaning of particular words andpassages. In some religious traditions, such as Christianity, the text—in this case, the Bible—isusually found in a translated form to be read by any literate member of the community. This wasnot always true. It was in the Middle Ages (roughly 500–1500 C.E.) that Catholicism as we knowit today truly emerged. In the absence of a strong central government following the collapse ofthe Roman Empire, the Church became both a religious and a secular power. During this time theChurch was seen as the intermediary between humankind and God—God’s message for peoplecame to them through the Church. Very few people were literate, and the Bible was available onlyAnd out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of theair, and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam calledevery living creature, that was the name thereof.And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of thefield; but for Adam there was not found a helpmate for him.And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one ofhis ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought herunto the man.And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be calledWoman, because she was taken out of Man.36Chapter 2 • MythologyBOX 2.1(Continued)"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"in Latin. This was not seen as a problem, because the Church existed to interpret God’s word.Later, the Protestant Reformation would emphasize the Bible, and not the Church, as the sourcefor true Christianity. Among the central beliefs of Martin Luther, who began the Reformation,was that laypeople should read the Bible for themselves. This meant not only that everyoneneeded to learn to read, but also that the Bible had to be translated into the local languages.Perhaps one of the most famous translations of the Bible was that ordered by King James I ofEngland and published in 1611. The King James Bible is still widely used today. Many Bible schol-ars, however, note what they consider to be inaccurate translations of certain words and passages,resulting from the knowledge and political atmosphere of the early seventeenth century.The King James Version is written in what is now an older form of English. Language changesover time, and written religious texts that do not change will, over time, appear to use words andphrases that are no longer a part of the spoken language. Religious texts are often written in a“religious” form of a language, using words and phrases that are not used in everyday speech. Somesocieties even have distinctive dialects or languages that are reserved for recitation of religious narra-tives. For example, consider the following excerpt from the Eighth Psalm: “When I consider thy heav-ens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thouart mindful of him?” Forms such as thy, hast,and thouwere once commonly used words in English,but no longer. Today their presence in a narrative often labels that narrative as being religious.Many modern versions of the Bible exist today. These are attempts to create what areconsidered to be more accurate translations of the earliest extant versions of the Bible, written inmodern language that is easier to read and understand by people today. Yet many people areuncomfortable with modern translations and retain the King James Version because it soundsmore “religious.” This resembles the special religious language forms reserved for religiousnarrative that are found in many societies. Interestingly, there are versions of the King JamesBible that attempt to modernize the language yet retain the use of religious linguistic forms. (SeeBox 2.2 for a discussion of gender-neutral translations of the Bible.)Chapter 2 • Mythology37BOX 2.2The Gender-Neutral Christian BibleWritten texts often exist in multiple versions. Zondervan, the world’s largest publisher of Bibles, haspublished over a dozen different translations. Some of the translations preserve more traditionallanguage, such as thou,and others attempt to translate the Bible into more modern language. Onearea of debate with regard to modern translations is the issue of gender. The language used inmost Christian Bibles not only refers to God as male but also uses the masculine generic (e.g., say-ing manto mean both men and women). Some argue that this language is not inconsequentialand actually both reflects and shapes the way that people think. Changing this language is seen asa way to address the outdated gender roles portrayed in the Bible and help achieve gender equality.When Zondervan updated its Revised Standard Version(RSV) in 1990 as the New RevisedStandard Version, it was met with much opposition from Christians who felt the changes not onlywere unnecessary, but in some cases changed the meaning of the text. For example, compare theRevised Standard Version(RSV) and New Revised Standard Version(NRSV) translations of John 14:23:“Jesus answered him, ‘If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will lovehim, and we will come to him and make our home with him.’ ” (RSV)(continued)"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38Chapter 2 • MythologyUNDERSTANDING MYTHSMyths exist in all human societies. They have been collected and analyzed by countless anthropol-ogists, folklorists, and other scholars. Many different theoretical orientations have developed astools to study and explain myths. While myths show an astonishing degree of variability, certainlycommon themes occur that have become the focus of scholarly study. In this section, we will look atsome of the approaches to the study myths and survey some of the common themes that are found.Approaches to Analysis of MythsThe analysis of myth can be approached from many different perspectives. Are myths literal orsymbolic? If they are symbolic, how should these symbols be interpreted? How are myths tied to“Those who love me will keep my word, and my Father will love them and we will come tothem and make our home with them.” (NRSV)Critics argue that the new translation obscures the original meaning that Jesus and his Father wouldcome to dwell with individual believers.Another example comes from Acts, when Cornelius fell down and began to worship Peter. Inthe Revised Standard Version,Peter lifted him up and said, “Stand up; I too am a man” (Acts 10:26,RSV). In the New Revised Standard VersionPeter says, “Stand up; I am only a mortal.” Again, it isargued that this is an important shift in meaning from an emphasis on one’s humanity (“I too am aman”) to an emphasis on one’s mortality (“I too am mortal”).In other cases, critics argue that the changes are unnecessary and do not make sense—forexample, making the army of Israel gender-neutral (using the term “warriors” instead of “men ofwar”) when it is historically accurate that the army was composed only of males. Similarly, they seechanging Paul’s statement in Corinthians (1 Cor. 13:11) from “When I became a man, I gave upchildish ways” to “When I became an adult” as unnecessary because Paul is in fact a man.Further controversy erupted in the late 1990s when Zondervan announced that it was going topublish a new, more modern translation of the company’s New International Version,which is secondin sales only to the King James Version,still very similar to its original 1611 form. The New InternationalVersion(NIV) is popular with evangelical Christians. The new version, called Today’s New InternationalVersion(TNIV), also uses gender-neutral language. However, the changes made in Today’s NewInternational Versionwere made only in regard to human beings. Some felt that the changes did notgo far enough because God is still referred to as masculine (e.g., Father) and not with neutral terms(e.g., parent). In September 2009, Zondervan announced that they would publish a new version of theNIV in 2011 and at that point discontinue the TNIV version. Maureen Girkins, president of Zondervan,is quoted calling the TNIV “divisive” and said, “We need to undo the damage.” Committee ChairmanDouglas Moo stated, “We are all committed evangelicals who believe in the importance of every wordin God’s word....We can’t fit the Bible into any cultural mode.”aObviously, there are many issues that shape this controversy. They include the degree to whichlanguage shapes thought and society, whether the masculine emphasis of the Bible was intended andshould be preserved, and how accurately translations must reflect the original text. The debate is notmerely about language but about the Christian worldview regarding gender issues in general.BOX 2.2(Continued)aC. L.

Do myths serve functions, and if so, which ones? Do myths reflect the waythat the human mind works, the way a specific culture works, or both? Of the different ways ofanalyzing religious narratives, many are based on the different theoretical approaches to thestudy of religion discussed in Chapter 1.SEARCHING FOR MYTH ORIGINS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.The evolutionary school inanthropology saw a unilinear progression from more “primitive” societies to more “civilized”ones. Accompanying this progression was a similar proposed progression from magic to religionto science. Myths were seen as belonging to the “primitive” period, with sacred myths beingreplaced by secular folktales until finally dying out altogether in “civilized” societies. (It isimportant to remember that anthropologists no longer believe in such an evolutionary progres-sion or that cultures can be classified as “primitive” or “civilized.”)Theorists from the evolutionary school assumed that modern people living in small-scale societies lived and thought the same way that earlier European societies had. Theycompared myths found in many different cultures, looking for common elements from whichthey could reconstruct an assumed “original form” of myth from which all others hadderived. It was believed that doing this could help explain puzzling aspects of modernEuropean society.The work of James George Frazer (1854–1941) is a good example of this approach. Hecollected as many examples of myths and magical practices from around the world as possibleand published them as a thirteen-volume work entitled The Golden Bough.Although modernanthropologists criticize the information in The Golden Boughas taken out of its culturalcontext, the book is still widely read. As an example of the comparative approach, Frazeranalyzed the story of the fall of man in Genesis by looking at other origin-of-death mythscross-culturally:6The story of the Fall of Man in the third chapter of Genesis appears to be an abridgedversion of this savage myth. Little is wanted to complete its resemblance to thesimilar myths still told by savages in many parts of the world. The principal, almostthe only, omission is the silence of the narrator as to the eating of the fruit of the treeof life by the serpent, and the consequent attainment of immortality by thereptile....If my interpretation of the story is right, it has been left for the comparativemethod, after thousands of years, to supply the blank in the ancient canvas, and torestore, in all their primitive crudity, the gay barbaric colours which the skilful handof the Hebrew artist had softened or effaced.Since Frazer’s time, further studies of myths have found that no single myth exists cross-culturally, but characteristic versions of a story may be found in specific areas. For example, inAfrica, origin-of-death myths revolve around a failure to deliver a message, whereas amongNative Americans the story centers on a debate on the subject of death.Around the turn of the twentieth century, a new approach to the study of myth was popular.This approach argued that myth is derived from earlier ritual practices. Based on this idea,theorists tried to reconstruct these rituals. Of course, this approach is not a complete answer tothe question of origins, because if myth came from ritual, where did ritual come from?This approach to myth encouraged looking beyond the text and seeing the connection thatmyths have to the cultures in which they are found. Although it is now more accepted that mythand ritual are closely related, this is seen more as myth and ritual being parallel expressions thanthat one is derived from the other."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40Chapter 2 • MythologyFIELDWORK AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS.Early studies of myth and religion, such as thoseof Frazer, were undertaken by people who read myths collected by missionaries, travelers, andothers from the comfort of their own libraries. This changed in the early twentieth century with anew emphasis on ethnographic fieldwork and participant observation, by anthropologists such asFranz Boas and Bronislaw Malinowski.Many consider Franz Boas to be the founder of the academic study of anthropology in theUnited States. He felt that mythology could be read almost like an autobiography written by theculture itself. As such, he used myths as sources of ethnographic data about such things askinship systems, housing types, division of labor, and hunting techniques.7Some of his studentslater challenged this approach; they felt that myths are more than just a literal reflection of whatgoes on in a culture. For example, Ruth Benedict, in her study of Zuni mythology, noted thatmyths are often idealized descriptions of things that do not happen in real life.8However,Boas brought to the anthropological study of myth the importance of recording full texts and ofrelating myths to the rest of culture.Like Boas, Malinowski favored a literal interpretation of myth; neither favored the ideathat myths could be symbolic. Both also emphasized in-depth study of one culture at a time asopposed to comparing myths cross-culturally. Malinowski was a founder of the functionalapproach in anthropology, previously discussed in Chapter 1, which turned from the nineteenth-century interest in the origins of myth to a focus on how myths function in a culture. Malinowskiwrote that myths are seen as a force to help maintain the society:9Studied alive, myth, as we shall see, is not symbolic but a direct expression of itssubject-matter; it is not an explanation in satisfaction of a scientific interest, but a narra-tive resurrection of a primeval reality, told in satisfaction of deep religious wants, moralcravings, social submissions, assertions, even practical requirements. Myth fulfills inprimitive cultures an indispensable function; it expresses, enhances, and codifies belief;it safeguards and enforces morality; it vouches for the efficacy of ritual and containspractical rules for the guidance of man. Myth is thus a vital ingredient of human civiliza-tion; it is not an idle tale, but a hard-worked active force; it is not an intellectualexplanation or an artistic imagery, but a pragmatic charter of primitive faith and wisdom.Malinowski conducted fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands and described how the islandersthemselves distinguish between folktales, legends, and myths. Myths are not told for entertain-ment or to impart historical information, but are used to justify and explain religious rituals aswell as social and moral rules. For example, before the Trobriand annual feast of the return of thedead, myths are told that explain why humans die, why the spirits of the dead have to leave thevillage, and why they return once a year. Trobriand Islanders also engage in extensive ceremoni-al trading; the rules for such trade, the magic used to prepare canoes for the voyage, and even thegeographical routes taken are all related to specific mythology.Critics of the functional approach point out that it focuses only on benefits, not on institu-tions or practices that may be oppressive or exploitative. Functionalism also focuses on consensusbuilding, not, for example, the potential conflict caused by competing versions of a myth. Becauseof this emphasis on consensus and function, the approach does not deal well with cultural change.STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS.Structural analysis, as the name implies, focuses on the underlyingstructure of the myth. This approach is based on the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, who pointed outthat humans tend to think and categorize the world in terms of binary opposites, such as black and"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 • Mythology41white.10The division of the world into binary opposites can be seen cross-culturally in myths, asin the analysis done by Edmund Leach of the structure of the story of Genesis.11Examples ofbinary opposites contained in Genesis are light/dark, day/night, heaven/earth, man/animal, andman/woman. Leach also points out that these opposites are frequently mediated by a third, anom-alous category, such as life and death being mediated by the third category of life after death.In the following portion of Genesis, the binary opposites of light and dark as well asheaven and earth are established (Genesis 1:4–8):And God saw that the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from thedarkness.And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And theevening and the morning were the first day.And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let itdivide the waters from the waters.And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under thefirmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning werethe second day.Structural analysis focuses on the structure, not content, of religious narratives. Itdemonstrates that stories that seem very different on the surface may have a similar underlyingstructure. We can also apply structural analysis to a story from the Gururumba of New Guinea(Melanesia culture area). The primary binary opposition in Gururumba culture is that of natureand culture. We can see this opposition being expressed in several ways in the Gururumba mythof the origin of women, told in Box 2.3.From this story, we can see that the nature versus culture dichotomy is related to thedifferences between the sexes. Women are part of nature, whereas men are associated withculture. The origin of the first woman from an egg and her various reversions to animal formswhen she is pursued clearly associate women with nature. The wild female is only culturallytransformed through human (male) agency. The sugarcane is a symbolically male plant used tochange the biologically nonuseful woman into a culturally useful wife. Her son is the first maleborn of a female, and thus not fully cultural, as can be seen when he turns into a fish. He is not acomplete adult, both biologically and socially, until his final transformation in the men’s house.The boy himself then becomes a transformer, changing his sisters into wives and other men intosocial allies.Critics of structuralism argue that it is a very sterile approach to the study of religiousnarrative and that it is ultimately dehumanizing. Structural analysis can also be very complicated,leaving mythical analysis only to those who are well versed in this approach.PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMBOLS IN MYTH.Another approach to the analysis of myths interpretsthem as being symbolic and sees this symbolism as being rooted in human psychology. Thisapproach is based on the work of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.Freud described various psychological defense mechanisms, such as projection, in whichone’s own unconscious attribute is perceived and reacted to in some other person or some otherthing.12For example, Freud saw individual dreams as symbolically expressing unconsciouswishes and a similar process occurring with myths for groups. Myths are therefore a type of“shared dream.” Freud also emphasized the importance of early childhood experiences, such"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42Chapter 2 • Mythologyas the nature of the parent–child relationship. He then proposed a relationship between earlyexperiences and adult projection systems such as myth. Although such processes as projectionand symbolism were considered universal, the actual symbolic content would be expected tovary as childhood conditions varied.The narrative most associated with the psychoanalytic approach is the Greek story ofOedipus, the man who unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother. Freud argued thatthis story represents a deep psychological conflict experienced by all boys. Because he consid-ered this case reflective of universal developmental issues, he expected similar stories to befound cross-culturally. In fact, Allen Johnson and Douglas Price-Williams in their research havefound Oedipus-type stories from cultures around the world.13Similar to Freud in its emphasis on human psychological processes is the work of CarlJung.14In contrast to Freud, Jung felt that myths stemmed from something beyond the individualunconscious. Just as individuals have an unconscious mind, Jung believed that humans as agroup share a collective unconscious, or inborn elements of the unconscious that are manifestedin dreams and myths. The main characters of these dreams and myths are termed archetypes.BOX 2.3The Gururumba Creation StoryThe story begins in the distant past when things were not as they are today. There were novillages, no pigs, and no women. One day two brothers go into the forest to look for food. Theycome upon an eagle’s nest in which they find eggs and food that the eagle parents have left. Thebrothers take the food for themselves. They return several times to do this until one time whenone of the eggs hatches and the first woman emerges. The boys take the woman back to theirhome and feed her and she grows up.Then one day the younger brother decides to try to have sex with the woman. However, heis unable to do so because she does not have a vagina. He asks his older brother what to do. Hisolder brother takes a sugarcane (a symbolically male plant for the Gururumba) and hurls it at thewoman to make an opening, but she runs away. The younger brother chases her, but every timehe catches on to her arm or leg she turns into an animal and slips away. Finally he is able to catchhold of her thumb and have sex with her.The woman gives birth to a son and several daughters. Later when the son is grown he askshis father if he can accompany him into the forest, but the father says no. The boy becomes veryupset and jumps into the river and becomes a fish. The father does not know what to do but thebrothers see smoke coming from the forest (which means a wise old man lives there). This mancomes and uses magic to change the fish back into a boy. The father is so happy that he builds thefirst men’s house and puts his son inside to make him a man. When the son emerges from themen’s house, pigs spring from the ground. The boy later notices smoke coming from the grass-lands and realizes that there are other men out there who have no women and no pigs. So he giveseach of his sisters a pig and sends them to the other men, beginning an exchange relationship.Source:As told by Philip Newman, lecture in the Anthropology of Religion at the University of California at Los Angeles, 1990."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 • Mythology43Oedipus is just one example of an archetype; other archetypal characters that have been suggestedinclude the Trickster, the Hero, the Orphan, the Seeker, the Destroyer, the Creator, the Sage, andthe Fool. Another example is the Phoenix, taken from the Greek story of the bird that rises fromits own ashes. The Phoenix is a story of rebirth. A familiar telling of the Phoenix archetype isfound in Christianity’s death and rebirth of Jesus Christ.In part because Jung’s archetypes are alleged to be universal and precultural, he hasreceived less attention in anthropological circles than Freud, whose theories are more amenableto cultural relativism. Anthropologists have also criticized Jungian analysis for rarely using datafrom non-Western sources.Common Themes in MythsAs we can see from the preceding discussion, underlying the diversity of narratives found cross-culturally are some common elements and themes. These similarities have been explained invarious ways. Diffusion, or the spread of cultural traits from one group to another, is always apossible explanation. Others focus on the shared nature of human cognition and psychology. Theideas of Freud and Jung are good examples of this approach, although Freud saw the similaritiesstemming from shared individual experiences, whereas Jung focused on a universally sharedcollective unconscious. In this section we will explore some of the common stories that are foundin religious narratives around the world.ORIGIN MYTHS.Origin myths answer some of the most basic questions that humans have:Who are we? Why are we here? What is our relationship to the world? Origin stories address themost basic questions of identity, both personal and communal. Creation myths are generally themost sacred of the religious narratives. All other narratives ultimately build on the groundworklaid down in origin myths.A common element in origin stories is the birth metaphor. When the supernatural powerdoing the creating is female, this is generally a spontaneous and independent birth. When the super-natural power is male, the birth is more symbolic: The god vomits or excretes the world or perhapssacrifices part of his own body to make the world. In the following origin story from the Bushongo,a Bantu people from Zaire (Guinea Coast culture area), the male deity vomits the world.15In the beginning, in the dark, there was nothing but water. And Bumba was alone.One day Bumba was in terrible pain. He retched and strained and vomited up the sun.After that light spread over everything. The heat of the sun dried up the water untilthe black edges of the world began to show. Black sandbanks and reefs could be seen.But there were no living things. Bumba vomited up the moon and then the stars, andafter that the night had its own light also. Still Bumba was in pain. He strainedagain and nine living creatures came forth [a leopard, crested eagle, crocodile, fish,tortoise, lightning, white heron, beetle, and a goat]. Last of all came forth men.Many origin myths begin with creation out of chaos, darkness, or the void. The followingstory is from the Yoruba, a society in West Africa (Guinea Coast culture area):16In the beginning the world was a watery, formless Chaos that was neither sea norland, but a marshy waste. Above it, in the sky, lived the Supreme Being, Olorun,attended to by other gods, including Orisha Nla, called the Great God. Olorun called"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44Chapter 2 • MythologyOrisha Nla into his presence and ordered him to make a world. It was time to makea solid land and Orisha Nla was given a snail full of magic earth, a pigeon, and a five-toed hen to accomplish the assignment. Orisha Nla came down to the Chaos andset to work organizing it. He threw magic earth into a small patch. The pigeon andthe hen began to scratch in the magic earth, and they scratched until land and seawere entirely separated....Orisha Nla was sent back to earth to plant trees, includingthe first oil palm. Olorun made the rain fall from heaven to water the seeds, whichgrew into a great forest. In heaven, Olorun began to make the first people. They werefashioned from earth by Orisha Nla, but only Olorun, the Supreme Being, could givethem life. Orisha Nla hid in Olorun’s workshop to watch. However, Olorun knewthat Orisha Nla was hiding there and put him into a deep sleep, and so only Olorunknows the secret of how to bring a body to life. To this day Orisha Nla, through theagency of parents, makes the body, but only the Supreme Being can give it life.Because of the process of diffusion, certain culture areas share narrative elements in com-mon. One example of this is the primordial egg as an element of creation stories in Asia, as seenin one Chinese origin story:17At first there was nothing. Time passed and nothing became something. Time passedand something split into two: the two were male and female. These two producedtwo more, and these two produced P’an Ku, the first being, the Great Man, theCreator. First there was the great cosmic egg. Inside the egg was Chaos, and floatingin Chaos was P’an Ku, the Undeveloped, the divine Embryo. And P’an Ku burstout of the egg, four times larger than any man today, with an adze (or a hammer andchisel) with which he fashioned the world.A final example of an origin myth is the emergence myth, common throughout NorthAmerica. The initial acts of creation take place under the earth, which is often organized into aseries of layers. The lower layers are dark and cramped. As the story progresses, the story movesup from one world to the next. This movement is an evolutionary progression as acts of creationoccur and knowledge is imparted to various creatures, including humans. Finally, they emergeonto the surface of the earth.There are several interpretations that have been given to emergence myths. The worldunder the surface of the earth can be seen as the womb in which creation occurs and the emer-gence onto the earth as a birth. The myth can also be seen as a reflection of the life cycle of maizethat begins as a seed under the ground and then emerges onto the surface of the earth.One of the best-known emergence myths is Diné Bahanè,the Navaho creation story. Theearly part of the story takes place under the earth where there are four worlds, one on top of theother. The story begins in the first world, the bottom-most world, and then progresses upward.Usually some danger or destructive power forces the creatures to escape through a hole in the skyinto the next world.In the fourth world we meet the four Holy People, immortal beings who travel on the rainbowfollowing the path of the sunray; they can control winds and thunder. The Holy People then createthe first humans, First Man and First Woman, from ears of corn. (Corn, cornmeal, and corn pollenplay important roles in Navaho rituals.) The life force comes from the wind, which is likened to aperson’s breath. Box 2.4 presents the section of Diné Bahanèin which we read of this creation."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 • Mythology45BOX 2.4The Navaho Creation Story: Diné BahanèAs for the gods, they repeated their visit four days in a row. But on the fourth day, Bits’íís lizhintheBlack Body remained after the other three departed. And when he was alone with the onlookers,he spoke to them in their own language. This is what he said:“You do not seem to understand the Holy People,” he said.“So I will explain what they want you to know.“They want more people to be created in this world. But they want intelligent people,created in their likeness, not in yours.“You have bodies like theirs, true enough.“But you have the teeth of beasts! You have the mouths of beasts!

The men dried themselves with white corn meal.Soon after they had bathed, they heard the distant voice coming from far in the east.They listened and waited as before, listened and waited.

They continued to listen and wait, listen andwait, until they heard the voice a third time as before, all the nearer and all the louder.Continuing to listen as before, they heard the voice again, even louder than the lasttime, and so close now that it seemed directly upon them, exactly as it had seemed before.And as before they found themselves standing among the same four Haashch’ééh dine’é,orHoly People as Bilagáanathe White Man might wish to call them.Bits’íís doot l’izhthe Blue Body and Bits’íís lizhinthe Black Body each carried a sacredbuckskin.

Upon this skin they placed the two ears of corn, being just as careful that the tips ofeach pointed east. Over the corn they spread the other buckskin, making sure that its headfaced east.Under the white ear they put the feather of a white eagle.And under the yellow ear they put the feather of a yellow eagle.Then they told the onlooking people to stand at a distance.So that the wind could enter.(continued)"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"46Chapter 2 • MythologyAPOCALYPTIC MYTHS.Many myths found in a great many societies tell of the catastrophicdestruction of the world, an apocalypse. The destruction takes many forms, one of which is byflood. A disciple of Freud’s once explained this as being related to dreams that happen when theperson has a full bladder. An alternative explanation lies in the fact that floods are likely to befrequently experienced, as people need to live near a water source. The Judeo-Christian floodmyth is the story of Noah’s ark in which God sends the flood to rid the earth of the wickednessof man.In many societies we see a cycle of creations and destructions. The ancient Aztecs ofMexico tell of four worlds that existed prior to the present world, the fifth world. The followingstory tells of the destruction of the fourth world.18During the era of the fourth sun, the Sun of Water, the people grew very wicked andignored the worship of the gods. The gods became angry and Tlaloc, the god ofrains, announced that he was going to destroy the world with a flood. However,Tlaloc was fond of a devout couple, Tata and Nena, and he warned them of the flood.He instructed them to hollow out a great log and take two ears of corn—one for eachof them—and eat nothing more.So Tata and Nena entered the tree trunk with the two ears of corn, and itbegan to rain. When the rains subsided and Tata and Nena’s log landed on dryland, they were so happy that they caught a fish and ate it, contrary to the orders ofThen from the east Nilch’i ligaithe White Wind blew between the buckskins.

It was only after their stomachs were full that they remembered Tlaloc’scommand.Tlaloc then appeared to them and said, “This is how I am repaid for savingyour lives?” They were then changed into dogs.

A goodexample comes from the New Testament in the Book of Revelations 21:1–9) Revelations focus-es on a coming battle, both earthly and spiritual, between the forces of good and evil. The mythtells us that the “Lamb” of God (believed by most to be Jesus Christ) will save his people from atime of great tribulations on earth, destroy the wicked and usher in an age of peace in which hispeople will live in the presence of God and Christ in a heavenly city.And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth werepassed away; and there was no more sea.And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out ofheaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of Godis with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and Godhimself shall be with them, and be their God.And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no moredeath, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the formerthings are passed away.And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And hesaid unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and theend. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shallbe my son.But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, andwhoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in thelake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials fullof the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew theethe bride, the Lamb’s wife.Much of the symbolism and story of Revelations is familiar to Americans even if they areunfamiliar with the source, including the four horsemen of the apocalypse, the lamb of God, theseven seals, the beast, the harlot of Babylon, and Satan and the lake of fire. As we will see inChapter 11, Revelations is the basis for many new religious movements as individuals interpretmodern-day happenings as being those foretold in the myth.TRICKSTER MYTHS.Some myths tell of serious matters—the origins of the world—whereasothers tell of lesser things, usually to provide explanations of why things are the way they are or"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48Chapter 2 • Mythologyhow people should and should not behave. In this latter category are a series of stories known astrickster stories.The tricksteris found in stories from all over the world. He is often part human, partanimal. Perhaps the best-known tricksters are Raven from the Northwest Coast of NorthAmerica, Coyote from the American Plains, and Spider from West Africa. These tricksters areadventurers, gluttons, searchers of sexual pleasures, lazy and easily bored, dishonest, andimpulsive. At the same time, the trickster is responsible for creating or bringing into the worldmany elements, such as fire or the sun, yet often these things happen inadvertently as a by-prod-uct of some other activity.Box 2.5 tells the Haida story of Raven, the trickster found in the Northwest Coast culturearea. Notice that in this story the reason Raven wants to steal the light is purely selfish; he is tiredof stumbling around in the dark. And his method of obtaining his goal is deceitful, yet theoutcome is a benefit to the world. Tricksters are also transformers. In this story, Raven turnshimself into a hemlock needle. Frequently Raven is caught and destroyed, but as long as anypiece remains, he is able to reconstitute himself, for Raven is immortal.FIGURE 2.1Raven and the First Men.

Whether she was as beautiful as hemlock fronds againstthe spring sky at sunrise or as ugly as a sea slug doesn’t really matter very much to this story,which takes place mainly in the dark.Because at that time the whole world was dark. Inky, pitchy, all-consuming dark, blackerthan a thousand stormy winter midnights, blacker than anywhere has been since.The reason for all this blackness has to do with the old man in the house by the river, whohad a box which contained an infinite number of boxes each nestled in a box slightly larger thanitself until finally there was a box so small all it could contain was all the light in the universe.The Raven, who of course existed at that time, because he had always existed andalways would, was somewhat less than satisfied with this state of affairs, since it led to anawful lot of blundering around and bumping into things. It slowed him down a good deal inhis pursuit of food and other fleshly pleasures, and in his constant effort to interfere and tochange things.Eventually, his bumbling around in the dark took him close to the home of the old man. Hefirst heard a little singsong voice muttering away. When he followed the voice, he soon came tothe wall of the house, and there, placing his ear against the planking, he could just make out thewords, “I have a box and inside the box is another box and inside it are many more boxes, and inthe smallest box of all is all the light in the world, and it is all mine and I’ll never give any of it toanyone, not even to my daughter, because, who knows, she may be as homely as a sea slug, andneither she nor I would like to know that.”It took only an instant for the Raven to decide to steal the light for himself, but it took a lotlonger for him to invent a way to do so.First he had to find a door into the house. No matter how many times he circled it or howcarefully he felt the planking, it remained a smooth, unbroken barrier. Sometimes he heard eitherthe old man or his daughter leave the house to get water or for some other reason, but theyalways departed from the side of the house opposite to him, and when he ran around to the otherside the wall seemed as unbroken as ever.Finally, the Raven retired a little way upstream and thought and thought about how hecould enter the house. As he did so, he began to think more and more of the young girl who livedthere, and thinking of her began to stir more than just the Raven’s imagination.“It’s probable that she’s as homely as a sea slug,” he said to himself, “but on the other hand, shemay be as beautiful as the fronds of the hemlock would be against a bright spring sunrise, if only therewere light enough to make one.” And in that idle speculation, he found the solution to his problem.He waited until the young woman, whose footsteps he could distinguish by now fromthose of her father, came to the river to gather water. Then he changed himself into a singlehemlock needle, dropped himself into the river and floated down just in time to be caught in thebasket which the girl was dipping in the river.Even in his much diminished form, the Raven was able to make at least a very small magic—enough to make the girl so thirsty she took a deep drink from the basket, and in doing so,swallowed the needle.(continued)"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"50Chapter 2 • MythologyThe Raven slithered down deep into her warm insides and found a soft, comfortable spot,where he transformed himself once more, this time into a very small human being, and went tosleep for a long while. And as he slept he grew.The young girl didn’t have any idea what was happening to her, and of course she didn’t tellher father, who noticed nothing unusual because it was so dark—until suddenly he became veryaware indeed of a new presence in the house, as the Raven at last emerged triumphantly in theshape of a human boychild.He was—or would have been, if anyone could have seen him—a strange-looking boy, witha long, beaklike nose and a few feathers here and there. In addition, he had the shining eyes ofthe Raven, which would have given his face a bright, inquisitive appearance—if anyone couldhave seen these features then.And he was noisy. He had a cry that contained all the noises of a spoiled child and an angryraven—yet he could sometimes speak as softly as the wind in the hemlock boughs, with an echoof that beautiful other sound, like an organic bell, which is also part of every raven’s speech.At times like that his grandfather grew to love this strange new member of his householdand spent many hours playing with him, making him toys and inventing games for him.As he gained more and more of the affection and confidence of the old man, the Raven feltmore intently around the house, trying to find where the light was hidden. After much exploration,he was convinced it was kept in the big box which stood in the corner of the house. One day hecautiously lifted the lid, but of course could see nothing, and all he could feel was another box. Hisgrandfather, however, heard his precious treasure chest being disturbed and dealt very harshly withthe would-be thief, threatening dire punishment if the Ravenchild ever touched the box again.This triggered a tidal wave of noisy protests, followed by tender importuning, in which theRaven never mentioned the light, but only pleaded for the largest box. That box, said theRavenchild, was the one thing he needed to make him completely happy.As most if not all grandfathers have done since the beginning, the old man finally yieldedand gave his grandchild the outermost box. This contented the boy for a short time—but as mostif not all grandchildren have done since the beginning, the Raven soon demanded the next box.It took many days and much cajoling, carefully balanced with well-planned tantrums, butone by one the boxes were removed. When only a few were left, a strange radiance, never beforeseen, began to infuse the darkness of the house, disclosing vague shapes and their shadows, stilltoo dim to have definite form. The Ravenchild then begged in his most pitiful voice to be allowedto hold the light for a just a moment.His request was instantly refused, but of course in time his grandfather yielded. The oldman lifted the light, in the form of a beautiful, incandescent ball, from the final box and tossed itto his grandson.He had only a glimpse of the child on whom he had lavished such love and affection, foreven as the light was traveling toward him, the child changed from his human form to a huge,shining black shadow, wings spread and beak open, waiting. The Raven snapped up the light inhis jaws, thrust his great wings downward and shot through the smokehole of the house into thehuge darkness of the world.That world was at once transformed. Mountains and valleys were starkly silhouetted, theriver sparkled with broken reflections, and everywhere life began to stir. And from far away,another great winged shape launched itself into the air, as light struck the eyes of the Eagle forthe first time and showed him his target.The Raven flew on, rejoicing in his wonderful new possession, admiring the effect it had on theworld below, reveling in the experience of being able to see where he was going, instead of flyingblind and hoping for the best. He was having such a good time that he never saw the Eagle until theEagle was almost upon him.

The title refers to the fact that although thereare thousands of different stories involving heroes throughout the world, they all follow the samebasic story line, what Campbell calls the monomyth. Campbell describes the monomyth asfollows: “A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernaturalwonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comesback from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.”19doing so he dropped a good half of the light he was carrying. It fell to the rocky ground below andthere broke into pieces—one large piece and too many small ones to count. They bounded back intothe sky and remain there even today as the moon and the stars that glorify the night.The Eagle pursued the Raven beyond the rim of the world, and there, exhausted by the longchase, the Raven finally let go of his last piece of light. Out beyond the rim of the world, it floated gently on the clouds and started up over the mountains lying to the east.Its first rays caught the smokehole of the house by the river, where the old man sat weeping bitterly over the loss of his precious light and the treachery of his grandchild. But as thelight reached in, he looked up and for the first time saw his daughter, who had been quietly sitting during all this time, completely bewildered by the rush of events.The old man saw that she was as beautiful as the fronds of a hemlock against a spring skyat sunrise, and he began to feel a little better.Source:From The Raven Steals the Light,by Bill Reid and Robert Bringhurst, published in 1988 by Douglas & McIntyreLtd (now D&M Publishers, Inc.).

Modern people lack myths, he asserted, because new scientific knowledge has refuted theliteral meaning of myths. Campbell believed that the true meaning of myth is symbolic, not liter-al. He favored a psychological, Jungian interpretation of this symbolism and believed that if mythsare interpreted in this way, they are not incompatible with modern science. Campbell believedthat accepting myths will give meaning to life and restore tranquility in modern society. Many ofthese assumptions are questioned by social scientists (for example, why does myth alone providemeaning and not other religious or cultural phenomena?).Like Jung, Campbell asserted that the patterns and symbols he discusses are universal.However, he never actually demonstrated this to be true. For example, in his most popular work, TheHero with a Thousand Faces,Campbell presented a composite universal hero pattern, but made noreferences to any myths from sub-Saharan Africa or aboriginal Australia. Critics also point out thathe bases his pattern on bits and pieces from different narratives; no single myth is analyzed in full.(continued)"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52Chapter 2 • MythologyThe hero’s journey is a common theme encountered in many myths. Sometimes the herois based on a real person whose story has been idealized. Other times the hero has no basis inreal life. The first stage of the hero’s journey is the departure. The hero, frequently an orphanedyouth, is thrust out of his or her community for one of several reasons, such as the destructionof his or her home by some supernatural force. The second phase, initiation, includes the hero’straining, as he or she learns to utilize supernatural tools, such as a sacred sword, under thedirection of a master, who frequently possesses supernatural power. In the third phase, thereturn, the hero returns and accomplishes the task. The monomyth is frequently found in originstories, where the hero is responsible for bringing some knowledge to humans.Entire religious systems may be based on a hero story. Buddhism is based on the story ofthe Prince Siddhartha Gautama. Gautama leads a very sheltered life in his father’s palace until hebecomes aware of sickness, suffering, and death and the fact that he too is subject to them. Heleaves behind his worldly possessions and spends years wandering, fasting, and meditating. He learns all he can from various teachers, but nothing seems to appease his sorrow and empti-ness. In desperation, he resolves to sit under a Bodhi tree until he finds the answers he has beenlooking for. He is attacked by Kama-Mara, the god of love and death, but is victorious. Duringhis time under the tree, Gautama gains knowledge and enlightenment and is thereafter referred toas the Buddha, or the “Enlightened One.”The same monomyth structure is also frequently used in popular films, such as Star Wars,The Wizard of Oz, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings,and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.Table 2.2 compares some elements that are common to some of these movies.CONCLUSIONThe most fundamental questions asked by human beings—about the nature of life, existence, anddeath—are answered in the religious narratives we tell. These stories both explain and structureDespite this criticism from social scientists, Campbell is popular with the general public.Campbell recorded interviews with Bill Moyers that would air on PBS in 1988 and be published asThe Power of Myth. During one such interview, the following exchange took place:BILLMOYERS:Do you ever have the sense of . . . being helped by hidden hands?JOSEPHCAMPBELL:All the time. It is miraculous. I even have a superstition that has grownon me as a result of invisible hands coming all the time—namely, that if you do followyour bliss you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waitingfor you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you cansee that, you begin to meet people who are in your field of bliss, and they open doors toyou. I say, follow your bliss and don’t be afraid, and doors will open where you didn’tknow they were going to be.After this, “follow your bliss” became a catchphrase for people who admired Campbell’sideas for finding meaning in life.Source:Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth—with Bill Moyers(New York: Doubleday, 1988), p. 120.BOX 2.6(Continued)"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 • Mythology53SummaryThe ways a society perceives and interprets itsreality is known as its worldview.

Oral texts are recited,and this recitation often has the characteristics ofperformance. One of the consequences of the oraltransmission of stories is that they are frequentlyunconsciously altered with each generation,which explains the existence of different versionsof the same myth within a society.There are many ways of interpreting myths.Functional analysis sees myths as forces thathelp to maintain the society. Structural analysisfocuses on the underlying structure of myths. Thepsychoanalytic approach sees myths as symboli-cally expressing unconscious wishes.Certain basic themes are common through-out the world. Origin myths provide answers tothe questions: Who are we? Why are we here?What is our relationship to the world? Thesestories play an important role in laying out theculture’s worldview.

Most often, this communication is simple andvery specific to the situation. A stimulus—such as the sight of a stranger, predator, orfood—may bring about a response of some kind: threat, flight, or eating. However,the situation exists in the here and now. The reaction is an immediate response to the specificcircumstances.Humans also encounter strangers, predators, and food. However, the human response ismore complex than that of other living creatures. Humans react to the presence of a strangerentering their midst, but the stranger may be seen as an enemy warrior, a merchant, or a monk—and will be dealt with appropriately. The reaction to a predator might be to prepare a spear fordefense or to perform magical rites to ward off the danger. Humans feel hunger and respondto the presence of food, but many edible and nutritious foods are shunned because of cultural orreligious prohibitions. All of these behaviors involve communication, be it storytelling, ritual, orthe articulation of food prohibitions.The complexity of human communication is made possible through the ability of humansto create and use symbols. Symbols permit people to discuss abstract topics and to talk aboutthings in the past, in an envisioned future, or even in a supernatural world. The world of religionis a symbolic world.WHAT IS A SYMBOL?Let us begin by picking up an apple in our hand. We know that this is an apple by its shape, color,and smell, and we know what to do with it. Many nonhuman animals will react to an apple invery much the same way. Show an apple to a horse, and the horse will know by its shape, color,and smell exactly what it is and might take the apple from your hand and eat it. In this way,humans and other animals are very similar.As humans, however, we can do something that horses cannot do. For example, we candraw a blue triangle on a piece of paper and declare that this blue triangle represents an apple. Itcertainly does not look like an apple or smell or taste like an apple, but as long as everyone in ourcommunity accepts the idea that a blue triangle stands for an apple, we can use it in place ofa real apple in communication. If we have a fruit stand at an outdoor market, we can fly a bannerwith a blue triangle above our booth so that people will know that we have apples for sale.CHAPTERReligious Symbols3"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Newcomers might not know that a blue triangle stands for apples, but we can tell them, and oncethey become regular customers, members of our small community, they will participate in oursystem of communication. (Of course, a nonhuman animal can be trained to respond to a bluetriangle, but a human creates the symbol and a human does the training.) This ability to usesymbols to refer to things and activities that are remote from the user is termed displacement.In our community, the blue triangle is acting as a symbol. It is something that stands forsomething else. Most symbols have no direct connection with the thing they refer to. The associ-ation of a blue triangle with an apple is arbitrary; it could as easily be a yellow circle or a greensquare. As long as there is agreement within our community as to the meaning of the symbol, wecan communicate with one another using symbols rather than real objects.Being able to create and use symbols is extremely useful. We can use symbols to refer tothings that are not directly in front of us—a faraway place, for example, or something we wouldlike to do in the future. We might talk about going to the grocery store to buy apples, yet theremight not be an apple in sight. We also can talk about fruits that we have never seen or tasted,perhaps a durian fruit from Southeast Asia. These are examples of displacement. And if wediscover a new fruit that no one has ever seen before, we can create a new symbol, such asa name, to refer to it. This feature of symbols is termed openness.We can also use symbols to stand for things that are more complex than simple objects.Symbols can stand for emotions and complex philosophical concepts that exist only in ourminds. Symbols can create a supernatural world or create myths about the past. Joseph Church,discussing language, writes:1we can manipulate symbols in ways impossible with the things they stand for, and soarrive at novel and even creative versions of reality . . . . We can verbally rearrangesituations which in themselves would resist rearrangement . . . we can isolate featureswhich in fact cannot be isolated...we can juxtapose objects and events far separated intime and space . . . we can, if we will, turn the universe symbolically inside out.In our initial example we used a geometric shape, a blue triangle, as a symbol. Manysymbols are physical objects or artistic representations. Symbols do not have to be physical,however. Language is a system of symbols, but here the symbols are sounds. The only reasonthat the word applemeans a particular type of fruit is because when we learned English, welearned that the combination of sounds that make up the word applestands for that particularfruit. There is nothing inherently “applish” about the sound of the word apple,just as there isnothing “applish” about a blue triangle. In fact, this fruit is known by many other names in otherlanguages—manzanain Spanish and elmain Turkish, for example.Religious SymbolsSymbols are important elements in religious practice, and religious rituals center on symbols andthe manipulation of symbols. In Hinduism we might approach a statue that represents the godBrahma. In ritual the statue may be bathed with milk, and strings of flowers may be hung aroundits neck. People in many different culture areas use masks to impersonate gods, such asthe masks of the Hopi of the American Southwest and the Dogon of western Africa. The sandpainting of the Navaho, created as a part of ritual, becomes a portal into the supernatural world.Of course, not all symbols are physical things or artistic representations. Words, bothwritten and spoken, are critical elements in religious behavior. In Jewish ritual the Torah is takenChapter 3 • Religious Symbols57"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58Chapter 3 • Religious Symbolsfrom the ark with great ceremony to be read. In Tantric Buddhism, found in Tibet, words or for-mulas have great spiritual power, which builds as they are chanted over and over. Elements ofmusic and dance and of space and time can also serve as symbols. We will begin our discussionof symbols by looking at basic artistic representations.THE SWASTIKA.A symbol such as the swastikacan stand for very complex ideas and cancarry great emotional resonance. Most Americans and Europeans looking at the swastikaexperience anger or dread. In 1919, the German Nazi Party adopted the swastika as its symbol.Because of this the swastika has been associated with the terrible events perpetrated by the Nazisin World War II. A swastika spray-painted on a wall is often defined in law as a hate crime.The swastika is a religious symbol that is found in a great many religious systems (Figure 3.1).It is basically a pattern of lines set at right angles to one another and, as such, carries no inherentmeaning. It occurs in many versions—clockwise and counterclockwise, for example. The term isderived from the Sanskrit su(“good”) and avasti(“to exist”). The swastika is seen in the religiousart associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It is also found in the ancient artFIGURE 3.1Navaho Blanket with Swastika.Early twentieth-century Navaho blanket woven of white, red, and dark brown wool, with swastika at each end."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 • Religious Symbols59of Scandinavia and the Middle East, and it is even seen in early Christian art. In most of thesecontexts, the swastika has a positive meaning such as prosperity and good luck. However, in somecultures the reverse swastika is called the sauvastika and stands for darkness, misfortune, andsuffering.The swastika is found in Navaho art, in which it represents the Whirling Log, an elementof a story found in the creation myth (see Figure 4.1 on p. 85). The Whirling Log was a type ofdugout canoe built by the gods. The symbol represents the log with a support pole attachedbeneath. Attached to each end is a feather, which, as the log is whirling, stands out straight. Theculture hero Self Teacher traveled in this canoe on an epic journey. This design element is usedin many rituals, including the Night and Feather chants.THE PENTAGRAM.The term pentagramcan refer to any five-sided figure but is generallyused to refer to a five-pointed star, also called a pentacle(Figure 3.2a). Pentagrams are amongthe most widely used religious symbols, both historically and cross-culturally.Some researchers believe that the pentagram originated as the symbol of a pagan goddess.The pentagram became associated with this goddess because her sacred fruit was the apple. If anapple is cut in half through its equator, the seeds of the apple form a pentagram in each half. Thepentagram is also used by the Masonic order, which traces its origins back to Pythagoras and an-cient Greece.The pentagram was associated with the Hebrew Scriptures as a symbol of the five booksof the Pentateuch (the Torah). Early Christians used the symbol with a variety of meanings, in-cluding the representation of the five wounds of Christ and the star that prophesied the birth ofJesus. It was only during the Witchcraze (see Chapter 10) that the pentagram began to take ona connotation of evil. During this time, the symbol was actually referred to as the “witch’sfoot.” This association with evil became stronger for many when twentieth-century Satanistsadopted the pentagram as their symbol. The Satanist symbol is an inverted pentagram, mostcommonly shown with a goat’s head in the center (Figure 3.2b & c).As with the swastika, there are many misunderstandings about the meaning of the penta-gram owing to its various associations. Most recently, the symbol has been adopted by Wiccans,members of a Neo-Pagan religion that is reviving pre-Christian religious practices. (We will dis-cuss the Wiccan religion in more detail in Chapter 11.) Wicca is a nature-based, polytheisticreligion that emphasizes the use of good magic and not doing harm. For some Wiccans thepentagram represents earth, air, fire, water, and spirit; for others it refers to the four directionsand spirit. However, many Americans still associate the pentagram with evil when they see aperson wearing it.(a)(b)(c)FIGURE 3.2The Pentagram.(a) Pentagram, (b) Satanist inverted pentagram, (c) symbol of the Church of Satan."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60Chapter 3 • Religious Symbols(a)(d)(g)(b)(e)(h)(c)(f)(i)FIGURE 3.3Some Christian Symbols.(a) Roman Cross, (b) Greek Cross, (c) Cross of St.Andrew, (d) Tau Cross, (e) Coptic Cross, (f) Celtic Cross, (g) Cross of the RussianOrthodox Church, (h) Cross and Flame of the United Methodist Church (®The UnitedMethodist Church), (i) Jerusalem Cross.CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS.The crossis the symbol most clearly associated with Christianity(Figure 3.3). Yet the cross did not gain general acceptance for many centuries after the foundingof the Christian religion. A Vatican sarcophagus from the fifth century shows one of the firstdepictions of a cross in Christian art. It is a Greek cross (with arms of equal length); Jesus’ bodyis not shown. Some early Christians even argued against the use of the cross as a symbol ofChristianity because it had earlier pagan associations, most specifically the Tau cross (in theshape of the letter T).The cross that is widely used today is a Roman cross, but there is still considerable varia-tion in the exact look of the cross symbol. For example, Roman Catholic crosses are crucifixionscenes, complete with the body of Christ. The Protestant cross does not show the body of Christbecause Protestants emphasize that Jesus has risen from the cross and is no longer on it. A crosswith a dual flame behind it is the symbol of the United Methodist Church. The cross representsChrist, and the flame represents the Holy Spirit. The cross of the Orthodox Church has threecross bars: one for the inscription, one for the arms, and one for a footrest.If the cross was not the most important early Christian symbol, what was? It was thesimple fish symbol. There are several reasons why the fish was used. One often given is that"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 • Religious Symbols61Jesus referred to the apostles as “fishers of men.” The most commonly given reason, though, isthat the letters of the Greek word for fish, icthus,form an acrostic. An acrosticis a word that isderived from the first letter of a series of words. So icthusis derived from Iesous Christos TheouUiou Soter(“Jesus Christ of God the Son the Savior”).

In the Buddhist version of the game snakes and ladders, ethical actionsmove the player upward toward enlightenment, while selfish behaviors move one lower towardrebirth as a lower life form. Nikki Bado-Fralick and Rebecca Sachs Norris write:aAll elements of the games communicate. Not only the components that are designed tointentionally instill values or knowledge, such as cards or board design, but every elementof the game, from the box to the directions, can be read as cultural text. For example,games that have long or complicated directions are usually from hierarchical or highlyregulated religions. This makes sense, since the designers have included what theyconsider to be important, and in these religions rules and principles are fundamental andcrucial constituents. Unlike the intentional symbols and meanings embedded in religiousgames, directions are more subliminally illustrative, yet nonetheless teach importantaspects of religious life.Bado-Fralick and Norris point out that religious games and toys make many uncomfortableby associating religion with play, commerce, and profane activities. Yet, the separation of religion as its own domain, even the separation of childhood and its games and as a distinct stageof life, is a recent invention. Games and play have long been a part of religion, as for example indivination rituals (see Chapter 7).aN. Bado-Fralick and R. S.

Imagine, for example, walking into a great European cathedral with itsmassive stained glass windows, statuary, and paintings, all containing a myriad of symbols, orwalking through a Buddhist temple in Thailand, with its many representations of the figure ofBuddha, each with its own complex meaning and referents.The Sarcophagus of Lord PakalArtistic representations are often used to illustrate and supplement religious texts. The following isan archaeological example from the ancient Maya of southern Mexico in the Mesoamerica culturearea. Although contemporary Mayan religion has many parallels with the ancient Mayan religion,contemporary studies can provide only a limited understanding of ancient Mayan art. The fact thatwe can know as much as we do about the ancient Maya is because they built monumental buildings,chiseled great works of art into stone, developed a sophisticated calendar, and had a system ofwriting. However, not all Mayan symbols have been deciphered, and much remains to be learned.In 1949, the Mexican archaeologist Alberto Ruiz Lhuillier was working in the Temple ofthe Inscriptions at the site of Palenque. Like most Mayan temples, it was built on top of a largepyramid. While working in the temple, Lhuillier discovered a staircase under the floor leading toa room containing a large stone sarcophagus richly carved with Mayan pictures and writing(Figure 3.4). The cover was removed to reveal the skeleton of a man, that of one of the greatestkings to rule Palenque. His name was K’inich Janahlo Pakal, Pakal the Great, or Lord Shield. Hedied at the age of eighty on August 31, 683, after having ruled for sixty-seven years.As we in the twenty-first century look at this carving from the seventh century, especiallyif we have never encountered Mayan art before, we probably recognize only a few elements—perhaps a reclining figure and a bird near the top. Of course, if we were aristocratic Maya livingin the seventh century, the meaning of all of these elements would be known to us. Our fatherswould have taken us to the temple precinct to show us the various motifs carved into the stoneand to explain their meaning. As aristocrats, we also would undoubtedly have attended religiousclasses or received tutoring from the priests.This carving is important to modern scholars because it is a visual representation of theMayan cosmos. We cannot explain all of the elements, and limited space here prevents us fromoffering a complete explanation of what we do know, but let us examine some of the elements asexamples of how symbolic representations are used to create a virtual supernatural world.Near the base of the carving is an image of a skeletal snake. The skull of the “White-Bone-Snake” has been slit and spread out. The open jaws of the serpent form the portal that connectsthe world of the living with Xibalba, the world of the dead. We see Pakal at the moment of his deathdescending into the serpent’s jaws as he moves from the world of the living into the world of the dead.Behind the figure of Pakal, appearing to be growing out of the serpent’s jaw, is the CosmicTree, which is the central axis of the world. The tree is rooted in the underworld; behind Pakal isthe Middle World, which is the world inhabited by people; the upper parts of the tree reach intothe heavens. Many of the representations in the upper portion of the tree represent constellationsand heavenly bodies. For example, what appear to be branches that end in square-nosed serpents,flowers, and other symbols represent the Milky Way. The bird perched at the top of the tree is thecompanion of one of the gods involved with the creation of the world. We know this because ofvarious symbols carved on the bird, such as a necklace and the “ribbon” in its beak."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"63FIGURE 3.4The Mayan Cosmos.This carving is a symbolic representation of the Mayan cosmos.

There he will undergo a seriesof trials followed by his resurrection as a god. Associated with Pakal is a sacrificial bowl that iscarved with the symbol representing the sun. Like the sun that moves into Xibalba at sunset andis resurrected at dawn, so does Pakal move into the Underworld to be resurrected as a god. Afterhis death, the priests would enter into an altered state of consciousness (see Chapter 5) andcontact Pakal’s spirit. In fact, along the side of the staircase leading to his tomb is a pipe made ofbrick. This is a psychoduct, through which Pakal’s spirit moves from the tomb into the templesanctuary during rituals.The Meaning of ColorAs we saw with the sarcophagus of Lord Pakal, religious art can be quite complex. There aremany important elements in artistic representation. One of these is color. Although today we seethe statues and carvings of the Romans and the ancient Mayans in white marble or the color ofstone, we know that at the time these statues and carvings were made, objects of stone were oftencovered with paint.Colors have cultural meanings. In weddings, American brides wear white. Irish folk wisdomdictates the following:Married in white, you have chosen all right.Married in red, you’d better be dead.Married in yellow, ashamed of the fellow.Married in blue, your lover is true.Married in green, ashamed to be seen.Married in black, you’ll ride in a hack.Married in pearl, you’ll live in a whirl.Married in brown, you’ll live out of town.These meanings do not necessarily apply to other cultures. For example, sometimes white maybe avoided because of its association with death. In Chinese culture, brides wear red.Many scholars have studied color terminology. English has eleven basic color terms: red,orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, pink, black, white,and gray.These are the colors thatchildren learn in preschool. We also define colors more narrowly within these basic categories byusing combined terms (such as red-orange) or specialized terms (such as lavender and turquoise).All peoples in all societies, except individuals with some form of color blindness, see theentire visible spectrum of colors, but the color spectrum is not divided up into natural units of color.All languages have ways of dividing up this spectrum into arbitrary categories that are labeled bylinguistic forms. However, the actual number of basic color terms and how the visible spectrum isactually divided vary from culture to culture. Generally, languages of industrial societies tend to havea greater number of basic color terms than do languages spoken in less complex societies.A color term, a word such as blue,is a symbol. In this case, the word bluerefers not to aphysical object, but to a particular segment of the color spectrum, or, as a physicist might define it,a range of wavelengths of light. When speakers of different languages are asked to identify therange of colors covered by a particular color term, we see a great deal of variation. Symbols,including color terminology, are arbitrary and learned; they are parts of cultural traditions. For ex-ample, the Navaho think of the ideal blue as turquoise. The stone of that color not only is importantin jewelry making, but, also has religious importance. To the Navaho, “blue is the color of celestialand earthly attainment, of peace, happiness, and success, of vegetable sustenance.”2"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"YORUBA COLOR TERMINOLOGY.The language of the Yoruba of Nigeria in the Guinea Coastculture area has only three basic color terms. Each term covers a much larger part of the colorspectrum than do English color terms. Funfunincludes what English speakers call white, silver,and pale gray. Pupacovers red, pink, orange, and deep yellow. Dúdúincludes black, blue,purple, green, dark brown, red-brown, and dark gray.In the English language, colors evoke emotions. We say that a sad person is feeling blue;when angry, we see red; a jealous person is green with envy; a coward is yellow. The Yoruba alsoassociate colors with particular temperatures and temperaments. For example, funfunis asso-ciated with coolness, age, and wisdom; pupaevokes hotness; dúdúis dark and warm.The supernatural world of the Yoruba is populated by many spiritual beings called orisha.(The orishawill be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 9.) Obatala, the king of the orisha,anethical and merciful deity, is linked to the color funfun,the color of wisdom and respect. Objectsassociated with Obatala are frequently colored white, and he is sometimes called the “King ofthe White Cloth.” In contrast, Sango is associated with the color pupa.He rules thunder andlightning and is proud and quick-tempered, and his images are often colored red. Ossosi, who isassociated with hunting, is introverted and unstable. He is linked to the color dúdú,green andblue. The messenger of the gods is an orishanamed Esu-Elegba. He is the intermediary betweenthe people and the gods and ancestors and is the first deity addressed in rituals. Representationsof Esu-Elegba are usually done in black and white or, in Yoruba color terminology, funfunanddúdú. These are contrasting colors and represent the god’s unpredictability. Artistic repre-sentations of Esu-Elegba in carvings, paintings, and embroideries primarily use these two colors.A Yoruba seeing such a representation can identify the orishain part by the colors being used.SACRED TIME AND SACRED SPACESymbols are also used to create sacred realities: supernatural worlds, sacred spaces, and sacreddivisions of time.The Meaning of TimeAll the examples of symbols examined thus far have been things that we can directly see as partof some physical artistic endeavor, whether it is a shape or a color. Yet not all things symbolic arephysical. People also handle nonphysical entities symbolically. Our example will be the culturalhandling of time.What is time? People see time as being made up of recurring units that are based onobservable physical events: the movement of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, andthe passing of the seasons. We also can divide these units into phases. For example, a day can bedivided based on the position of the sun (morning, afternoon, and evening). In astronomicalterms, these recurring events represent the rotation of the earth on its axis (a day), the journey ofthe moon around the earth (a month), and the travel of the earth around the sun (a year). Humanactivities are organized by particular parts of the day or certain times of the year.Humans also create units of time that are not based on real astronomical events such as therotation of the earth. These units appear to be arbitrary. A week in our culture has seven days. Whynot five, as is common in parts of Central America and Africa? Why not eight, as was foundamong the ancient Inca of the South American Andes? And why not sixteen, as is found amongthe Yoruba of Nigeria? The seven-day week of Western society is derived from the cultures of theancient Near East and perhaps came from the division of the approximately twenty-eight-dayChapter 3 • Religious Symbols65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"66Chapter 3 • Religious Symbolslunar cycle into four quarters. In other words, concepts such as “a week” are nonphysical symbolsthat stand for particular periods of time. Many of these periods do not exist in the real world, butonly in the human mind.Time is an important element of religious rituals. Many rituals are performed at specificmoments of time, often as part of a ceremonial cycle. As we will see in the next section, timeoften has important symbolic meaning.THE MAYAN VIEW OF TIME.The passage of time had a deep religious significance for theancient Maya of southern Mexico and Central America. They developed several systems of mark-ing time that intersected with one another to form a complex calendar. Like many peoples, theMaya had a calendrical system based on the solar year consisting of about 365 days. The Mayadivided their year into eighteen months of twenty days and a nineteenth month of five days. Eachmonth was named, and each day within a month was numbered. A particular day was named by acombination of its numerical position within the month and the name of the month, just as we do.The solar year is a natural unit that is determined by the movements of the sun in the skythroughout the year. However, the Maya developed a second kind of year of 260 days that wasconstructed from a cycle of twenty day names and a second cycle of thirteen numbers. A partic-ular day was known by a number and a day name. The twenty-day cycle of day names and thethirteen-day number cycle are interconnected like teeth in two large gears. The same combina-tion of day name and number occurs every 260 days.The two calendar systems ran simultaneously, and a specific day was named after itsposition in both calendars, which resulted in 18,980 unique combinations of days. It took fifty-two years to go through all of these combinations and to start over again. The end of a fifty-two-year cycle and the beginning of the next was an important ceremonial event in Mayan religiouslife. The fifty-two-year cycle has no astronomical basis but is a part of Mayan culture, a part ofhow they understood their world. And this was just the beginning. The Maya recognized severalother cycles, such as that based on the movements of the planet Venus in the sky.Thus each day from the beginning of time in the Mayan calendar was unique and was des-ignated by a sequence of notations based on the various calendars. When a child was born, thechild was taken to a priest who used the designation of the day of the child’s birth to predict thechild’s future. Important events, especially those surrounding the ruler, were scheduled to fall ondays that were considered to be particularly auspicious. Thus to the Maya, time was much morethan just a flow of days and years. Time had an important religious meaning (Box 3.2).RITUALS AND CALENDARS IN MODERN WORLD RELIGIONS.There are many other exam-ples from modern world religions of the importance of time and calendars. Many rituals areperformed according to a temporal cycle. Such rituals are termed periodic rituals. They oftencommemorate the anniversary of important events in the history of the religion. Because of theimportance of setting the date of the celebration correctly, many religions continue to usecalendars that are older than the one most commonly used in the Western world.In Islam, Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, which is the month duringwhich the Qur’an was sent down from heaven to Mohammad. The month of Ramadan is a timefor worship and contemplation. During this time, Muslims follow many constraints on their dailylives, such as not eating or drinking during daylight hours. At the end of the day, the fast is broken with prayer and a meal. The Laylat-al-Qadr(the Night of Power) is celebrated on theevening of the twenty-seventh day of Ramadan, as the night when Mohammad first receivedthe revelation of the Qur’an. According to the Qur’an, this is also the night when God determines"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 • Religious Symbols67the course of the world for the following year. The end of the fasting, and of the month ofRamadan, is celebrated for three days in Id-al-Fitr(the Feast of Fast Breaking).The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar. Each month begins with the sighting of the firstcrescent of the new moon. The length of the month thus defined does not divide evenly into thesolar year—it is about eleven to twelve days short. As a result, the start of Ramadan shifts fromyear to year. In 2010 the month of Ramadan began on August 11, while in 2015 it will begin onJune 18. One of the consequences of this is that when Ramadan falls in the winter season, theperiod of fasting is relatively short and the weather is relatively cool. But it is quite differentwhen Ramadan falls during the summer season.BOX 3.2The End of TimeDifferent religious systems have different views of time. For some, time is cyclic. For others, it is a pro-gression from one phase to another. This was true of the ancient Maya. The Maya lived in the fourthworld which began on August 11, 3114 B.C.E. The Mayan calendar starts on this date, and from thatday forward, time is divided into a series of larger and larger inclusive units. The largest of these unitsis the baktunthat consists of 144,000 days (approximately 395 years). The end point of each cyclewas an important event in the Mayan calendar. December 21, 2012, the winter solstice, marks theend of the thirteenth baktunsince creation.aAlthough many are predicting the end of the world onthis date, there is no evidence that the Maya saw the end of a baktunas an apocalyptic event.However, predictions such as these sell a lot of books and make for a plot of an action-packed movie.Other religious systems also see time as being cyclic. One characteristic of Christian fundamen-talism (Chapter 11) is dispensationalism.This term refers to the belief that God has divided the historyof the earth into phases or “dispensations.” This idea was developed by the Englishman John NelsonDarby (1800–1882) who read the Bible as a historic document from which accurate predictions couldbe gleaned. His scheme consisted of seven phases, each ending with a catastrophe, such as the Fall,the Flood of Noah, and the Crucifixion. People today are living in the sixth dispensation. Like previousstages, this stage too will come to an end in some catastrophic manner. However, just before, therewould be a “Rapture” in which born-again Christians would be taken up to heaven and escape thesufferings of the Last Days. Later they would rule with Christ in the seventh dispensation.William Miller (1782–1849) was a Baptist preacher who, through careful study of the Bible asa historical document, believed that the world as it was known would end in 1843. This was thebeginning of an apocalyptic tradition that characterizes much of American Christianity. His movementbegan to spread and was referred to as Millerism. As the date approached, Miller predicted that theSecond Coming of Christ—the Advent—would occur sometime between March 21, 1843, andMarch 21, 1844. When the predicted event failed to take place, he announced a second date basedupon “corrected” calculations—October 22, 1844. The failure of the Advent occurring on that dateis called the Great Disappointment. Nevertheless, the idea had taken hold in American Christianity,although usually without a specified date. Out of the tradition of Millerism grew several religioustraditions that survive to this day, primarily the Seventh Day Adventists and Jehovah’s Witnesses.aWe should note that not all scholars agree with this interpretation of the Mayan calendar and its correlation with ourcalendar, so the actual date on our calendar may be off by a few days."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"68Chapter 3 • Religious SymbolsAnother example of periodic rituals being set to older calendars is the Yamim Nora’im(Days of Awe), or Jewish high holy days, which are observed for a ten-day period between thefirst and tenth days of the month of Tishri, the seventh month of the Jewish calendar. RoshHashanah (Jewish New Year) marks the beginning of this time period, and Yom Kippur (Dayof Atonement) marks the end. These are considered to be the most important of all the Jewishholidays and are the only Jewish holidays that are purely religious and not based on any histori-cal or natural event.The high holy days are a time for penitence and prayer during which Jews are given time torepent of their sins against God and ask God for forgiveness. On Rosh Hashanah, God judges thepeople and records His judgment in the Book of Life. However, there is a ten-day reprieve untilYom Kippur, when the Book is closed and sealed. Yom Kippur itself is a day for fasting and prayer.The Hebrew calendar is also a lunar calendar. But in order to keep the holidays from shift-ing too far, a thirteenth month is added every two or three years. In some years, extra days areadded to prevent Yom Kippur from occurring on the Sabbath. Thus the major ceremonies aremaintained within specific seasons of the year.Other times, not related to a specific calendar, may also have religious significance.A common example is the time following a death. In Judaism, this period of mourning is calledshiva. Shivabegins as soon as the mourner has returned from the cemetery and lasts for sevendays. During this time, the mourner remains at home and does not participate in any of his or hernormal activities, such as work or school. Friends and relatives visit the home of the mournersand often bring food.In the early Christian church, the celebration of Easter was correlated with the Jewish cele-bration of Passover, since the Last Supper was a Passover Seder, celebrated in the Spring.However, because different Jewish communities set the date somewhat differently, the earlychurch attempted to set the celebration of Easter according to their calendar (the Julian calendar,originally based upon the calendar reforms of Julius Caesar). Yet the date kept drifting later in theyear. Finally, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII decreed a new, reformed calendar, the calendar that weuse today (the Gregorian calendar). It features the placement of extra days in defined leap years.It took several centuries for the new calendar to be accepted throughout Europe and theNew World. Britain and the British Empire, including the American colonies, adoptedthe Gregorian calendar in 1752. By that time it was eleven days out of sync with the older Juliancalendar. As a result, when the changeover took place, the date of Wednesday, September 2,1752, was immediately followed by Thursday, September 14, 1752. Many people were unhappyhaving their birthdays dismissed in this fashion.Sacred Time and Space in AustraliaThe religious systems of the Australian Aborigines are focused on expressions of sacred timeand space. To understand these systems, we must examine the concept of totemism. A simpledefinition of a totem, as it is frequently used, is that of a symbol or emblem of a social unit.A special relationship is said to exist between a group or individual and its totem, which isfrequently, but not always, an animal. American culture possesses many such emblems. They arefound primarily in athletics as mascots and in business as logos. Many athletic teams are namedafter animals—such as bears, bulldogs, eagles, and panthers—and the selection of a team’smascot often reflects those characteristics of the animal that are deemed important for playersto display in that particular sport. Yet to think of totems simply as mascots and logos is verysuperficial, as we will see."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 • Religious Symbols69The term totemcomes from the Ojibwa language of Canada, in which the word ototemancan be translated as “He is a relative of mine.” This refers to particular animal species, known astotems, that become associated with Ojibwa clans, a type of kinship group. The clans are giventhe name of the totem.TOTEMISM AND THE DREAM TIME.Perhaps the best-known examples of totemism comefrom Australian aboriginal groups. The totemic system has many components, including totemicsymbols, myths, and a sacred landscape.In contrast to isolated sacred sites, which are often the sites of pilgrimages, indigenouspeoples live on a sacred landscape. The places described in their myths are places that existin their own physical world—a stream, a cave, a mountain. And their origin stories tell of thecreation of this landscape and the creation of the plants, animals, and people who inhabit it.The creation myths of the Australian Aborigines begin in the dim past during the DreamTime with the creation of an earth without features, an earth devoid of mountains, rivers, and plains.Supernatural creatures then appeared on the earth. These creatures of the Dream Time appearedfrom under the earth or, among coastal groups, on rafts. They then traveled over the landscape,creating the world as we see it today—the physical world, the plants, the animals, the people—aswell as the customs that govern people’s lives. They then left the surface of the earth or turnedthemselves into some object in the landscape, such as a boulder or hill. The places that areassociated with particular mythological beings are today sacred spaces that play important roles inreligious rituals. The landscape in which the Aborigines live is a canvas on which their mythologyis written, and various features of this landscape serve to define the nature of humanity.The stories of the Dream Time establish special relationships between humans and animals,for both types of creatures are descendants of the same supernatural being that was neither humannor animal. Thus the tie of kinship is extended to the animal world and to the rest of the livingworld as well as the physical landscape. These animals, plants, and natural objects are the totemsof the community. Any particular place, be it a water hole or a hill, can be associated with a par-ticular story and can be claimed as part of the religious heritage of a particular group of people.Within a community, different groups of people share different totems. Totems exist forbands, clans, the sexes, and even individuals. Claiming a totem brings with it special obligations.One is a prohibition against eating the flesh of one’s totemic animal. It is acceptable for othermembers of the community, even your spouse and children, to eat of your totem, but not for youbecause you share a special relationship with the totemic species. However, the flesh of one’stotem may be consumed as part of a ritual. Members of a totemic group have responsibilities toperform religious ceremonies, including initiation ceremonies. There are many other rules thatare part of the special relationship between an individual or group and its totem.Totemic affiliations also organize Australian society. Specific clans are associated withparticular totems. There are rules regulating who can marry whom. Complex rules define the affil-iation of one’s children as well as the appropriate social behaviors between different classes of kin.The determination of the group into which a child is born can be complex. In some groupsit is determined by rules of kinship. In many groups the pregnancy is thought to be the result of atotemic spirit, perhaps residing in a sacred water hole, entering the womb of the woman. Thehusband and other elders will question the woman to determine which spirit from what totemicgroup entered her womb to determine that child’s affiliation. In some groups the identity of thespirit is revealed in the father’s dream. On death, the individual’s soul returns to the totemic well.At some point, young men are initiated into manhood. These initiation rituals involve thelearning of ritual knowledge, including the ability to look at and handle totemic objects. These"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"70Chapter 3 • Religious Symbolsrituals also involve some type of alteration of the body, such as circumcision or the knocking outof a tooth. When visiting sacred places described in the Dream Time stories, wounds are openedor new wounds are made on the body, and a person’s blood is allowed to fall on sacred objects.Australian Aborigine culture has a rich tradition of symbolic religious art. This art includesarrangements of stones, decoration of sacred objects, bark paintings, and rock art. Sacred spaces,especially caves and rock overhangs, are decorated with paintings and engravings; some may beas old as 30,000 or older. Many of these were done by men as representations of totemic crea-tures, objects, and events; others were thought to have been completed by the totemic beingsduring the Dream Time. Some are said to actually represent totemic beings who turned to stoneor became paintings on a wall.MURNGIN TOTEMISM.Today much of the culture of the Australian Aborigines has been lostowing to depopulation and the influence of Western culture. Early descriptions of Aborigine peo-ples offer a rare glimpse into their lives. One of these early reports is that of W. Lloyd Warner,who lived among the Murngin between 1926 and 1929.3They lived in the northern and easternregions of Arnhem Land in the north of Australia.Murngin society is composed of several clans. Each clan is associated with a specific terri-tory as well as several totems. Within each territory are one or more sacred water holes that playan important role in Murngin religion. There are two classes of water holes—one sacred and onenot. The sacred ones were made by higher totems. Only initiated men may approach these areas.Many are sites where important events occurred during the Dream Time, and totemic spiritsreside there.Beneath the clan water hole, residing in waters under the earth, dwell the ancestors of theDream Time and totemic spirits. The spirits have the form of very small fish. A spirit will thenappear to a man in a dream and ask the man who his wife is so that the spirit may enter herwomb. A father may also know of this by some peculiar action of an animal. If an infant dies,its spirit returns to the water hole and, after a period of time, returns to the womb of the samemother. When any other person dies, his or her spirit goes back to the water hole, where itremains a spirit forever.Murngin mythology is very complex and consists of many interrelated stories and rituals.One of the important myth cycles is the one that tells the story of the Djunkgao sisters. Thesemythological sisters appeared on a raft, walked over the landscape with their two yam sticks(long, pointed sticks used to dig food out of the ground), and then disappeared beneath the earth.As they traveled, various plants and animals were “named” or created. They made the islands offthe coast, and they made totemic emblems, the sacred objects that are used in ritual.THE SYMBOLISM OF MUSIC AND DANCEMusic and dance play special roles in religious rituals. The degree to which music and dance areincluded in ritual is quite variable. Some rituals simply include a song; others focus on an elabo-rate performance of a myth in song and dance. Music and dance can be thought of as symbols asstories are told through movement and through music motifs.The Symbolism of MusicMusic is a key element in ritual. It may simply set the mood for a ceremony or may actually bethe primary vehicle by which religious stories are told and by which people communicate withthe gods. Music fulfills many roles during religious rituals and is used to teach, to express or"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 • Religious Symbols71engender emotional states, to produce altered states of consciousness, to please the supernaturalpowers, or to make contact with them.An important function of music is the facilitation of memorization. In nonliterate societies,large amounts of narrative must be committed to memory. Anyone who has had to memorize apiece of prose in school knows how difficult this can be. Poetry is easier to memorize than prosebecause poetry has rhythm and rhyme. The easiest of all to memorize are the lyrics to a song. Forthis reason, narratives and prayers are frequently chanted or sung.Of course, music also sets the mood for a ritual. The organ setting the mood for a funeral,a choir singing a medieval chant, the rejoicing of a gospel hymn—all illustrate the power ofmusic to set the ambience for ritual. We use music in a similar way for secular purposes.Compare the music you would select to listen to while studying with the music you would playwhen having friends over for a party or a date for a romantic evening. Movies continually usemusic to set the emotional tone. We know when to be happy, sad, or frightened on the basis of themusic on the soundtrack.Many early Christian missionaries understood the influence of music and brought pianosand organs with them to remote areas of the globe. A small organ might have been played in acrude bush church set in the middle of a tropical rain forest. However, these missionaries weremaking the assumption that the various types of music that we produce reflect universals inmoods and emotions.A somber hymn played on an organ reflects the sadness of a funeral, and a romping gospelhymn expresses the joy of closeness with God. We could assume that Euro-American religious,military, or love music will evoke the same emotional response in all societies throughout theworld. This assumption, however, turns out not to be true. In reality, Euro-American music oftenfails to convey its intended meaning to non-Westerners, and native musical idioms fail to moveoutsiders. Of course, the meaning of music is symbolic, and as such, it is part of the learnedtraditions of a culture.Realizing this basic fact, many missionaries and many contemporary musicians are writingmusic in traditional idioms and are discovering and importing tribal musical traditions intocontemporary music. This is an example of syncretism, the fusion of elements from two differ-ent cultures. For example, the well-known Congolese composition Missa Lubais a CatholicMass sung in Latin but set to music elements and instruments of the Kongo tribe of theDemocratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). African drumming, Australian Aboriginesongs, and Native American flute playing have all been integrated into new musical experiences.MUSIC IN RITUAL.Music plays important roles in the lives of foraging peoples. Colin Turnbullstudied the Mbuti Pgymies of the Ituri Forest in the Congo and recorded their music in the 1950s.The Mbuti sing throughout their day and hunters, walking in the dense tropical forest, will usesong as a way of maintaining contact with one another. The !Kung San of Botswana utilize songin their healing rituals. Several times a month they will gather around a fire in the evening andstart singing. Some members of their group, primarily men, begin to dance around the singersand enter an altered state of consciousness called !kia.Once they reach this stage they movearound the fire laying hands on each individual as healing ritual (see Figure 5.2 on page 113).In some cultures the actual musical sounds may be interpreted as sounds of the supernatural.The sound may be produced either vocally or instrumentally. One example of this is the Tuva(Siberian culture area). For the Tuva, spiritual power is found in nature. These spirits manifestthemselves both through physical appearance and by the sounds they make or that can be madethrough human interaction. Examples would be the sound of running water or the echo of a human"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"72Chapter 3 • Religious Symbolsvoice from a cliff. The way for humans to make contact with supernatural powers is to imitate theirsounds. Caves, in particular, are important for this purpose. Caves are sites of supernatural powerand can be used to contact the spirits of the earth. The type of vocal sounds the Tuva use is alsointeresting. They are known for a technique called xöömei,or “throat-singing.” A single vocalistusing this technique is able to produce two distinct pitches at the same time.Instruments are very important elements in music, and an unbelievable array of musicalinstruments can be found throughout the world. We can divide instruments into four basic types.Idiophonesare instruments that are struck, shaken, or rubbed. Common examples are rattles,bells, wooden drums, rasps, bullroarers, marimbas, and xylophones. Membranophonesareinstruments that incorporate a taut membrane or skin. These include drums. Cordophonesareinstruments with taut strings that can be plucked or strummed, hit, or sawed. These include harps,zithers, and violins. Finally, we have aerophones, in which air is blown across or into some typeof passageway, such as a pipe. These include whistles, pipes, didjeridus, flutes, and trumpets.For some cultures, sounds produced by musical instruments have religious significance.The best-known examples in the anthropological literature are the didjeridu of the AustralianAborigines and the molimo of the Pygmies of the Ituri Forest of Central Africa. These are verysimple aerophones that are essentially nothing more than long pipes, usually of wood. Thesounds of these instruments are said to be the sounds of spirits. Initiated men play these instru-ments out of sight of the women and children, who are told that the sound is the actual voice ofthe spirits. The true nature of the sound is revealed to young men as part of initiation rites.Music plays an important role in Africa, where it is associated with religious rituals andstorytelling. Membranophones, especially drums, are important instruments. Rhythm is highlydeveloped and, in contrast with Euro-American traditions, melody and harmony are secondary.A great many types of drums are played, and often they are combined into large drum ensembles.The Symbolism of DanceThe use of dance is not common in American religious rituals, but in many religious traditionsdance is an important means of symbolically representing the supernatural world and tellingreligious stories. Of course, dance does not exist in isolation. Dance is usually performed tomusic, frequently involves the chanting or singing of words, and involves the manipulation ofphysical symbols such as costumes and masks, sets, and props.Culture consists of patterned, traditional behaviors. We can define dance as a system ofpatterned, traditional movements. These movements, involving the whole body or sometimes just apart of the body such as the hands, are symbolic in that they have culturally determined meanings.Characters in well-known stories are identified by their traditional movements, such as their way ofwalking and moving their arms, as well as by their costumes, makeup, and masks. In societies thatlack systems of writing, dance becomes an important vehicle for telling sacred stories to the commu-nity. For example, among native Hawaiians, hula dances told the stories of the gods and goddesses.The Kwakwaka’wakw of the North American Northwest Coast culture area say that a humanfamily line was created when the ancestor of the group came down to earth, took off his mask, andbecame human. Carved animal masks are an important religious art form for the Kwakwaka’wakwand frequently are worn by the dancers who retell important mythic stories. Dance, however, goesfar beyond the telling of stories. Dances can act as offerings, and many deities like to be enter-tained. Dancers also can become conduits of supernatural power. The Kwakwaka’wakw maskeddancers, for example, become the being whose mask is worn for the duration of the ritual.In many cultures, gods and spirits enter the human body and take over its functioning. Theparticular movements during possession identify the god within the body and may actually provide"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 • Religious Symbols73communication between the deity and the human participants. For example, possession is animportant feature of Vodou. During a Vodou ritual, a song is sung to summon a particular god.When the god arrives, he or she possesses one of the dancers. A common metaphor is that thedancer is a horse on which the deity rides. Which god has possessed a dancer can be deduced by thedancer’s movements and actions. (We will discuss the Vodou religion in more detail in Chapter 11.)Early in the history of Islam, a group that was most interested in the mystical aspects of thereligion broke off to form the Sufi. One of the most important of the Sufi mystics was a mannamed Mevlana Rumi, who lived in the thirteenth-century Ottoman Empire. Rumi founded theMevlevi Order and revived the practice of whirling. The members of the Mevlevi Order are oftencalled “whirling dervishes” by people in the West. They wear long white skirts that billow out asthe dancers, their arms extended in the air, continue to turn. Through this whirling, the dancersseek to become one with God.The Tewa, a Pueblo group from the Southwest culture area, say that they dance to “seeklife,” “regain life,” or “renew life.” Many symbolic references to this theme of new life can befound in the movements of the dancers, the costumes that are worn, and the songs that are sung.Dancers lift their arms upward to symbolize the welcoming of rain; lower their arms to indicatedigging, planting, or harvesting; and move their arms from side to side to symbolize rainbowsor clouds. Costume designs are also symbolic. Long tassels represent raindrops; woven head-dresses contain depictions of squash blossoms or embroidered layers of clouds. The songs thataccompany the dances make references to dawn, youth, flowers, and growing corn. The Tewapractice agriculture in a very arid environment, so references to rain and items associated withrain such as clouds, thunder, and rainbows are important symbols of life.Tewa dances are generally held in open plazas where performers can be in contact with theearth. The dancers array themselves in long, parallel lines and move in unison to the beat of oneor more drums. The dancers themselves may sing or a chorus of singers standing nearby mayaccompany them. Before the dance, the participants prepare in a kiva, an underground room thatis entered from a hole in the roof. When the dance is about to begin, the dancers emerge from thekiva and move to the plaza. This is a symbolic reference to the Tewa origin story that tells howthe first people emerged from a world below into the present world.CONCLUSIONTo conclude our discussion of symbolism, we need to tie together several concepts that wehave explored thus far. Symbols are often based on specific episodes that are recounted inmyths, and they represent a specific worldview. An example we already discussed was theTewa practice of beginning dances by emerging from a kiva to symbolize the emergence fromunder the earth at the beginning of the world. We will reexamine some of the other symbols wehave already discussed to explore the connections between symbols, myth, and worldview.Bloodletting was an important part of Mayan religious rituals, and the sarcophagus of LordPakal contains blood symbolism. The reason for this is found in the origin story as told in a document known as the Popul Vuh,a seventeenth-century book that recounts the history of theMaya. In the Popul Vuhwe are told that the reason why the gods created people was to havea kind of living creature who would worship them. As they prepare to create human beings, thegods say, “So now let’s try to make a giver of praise, giver of respect, provider, nurturer.”4This reflects the worldview of the Maya that there exists a reciprocal relationship betweenthe Mayan people and their gods. The world was brought about by a sacrifice by the gods, but itwill continue to exist only if the Mayans in turn sacrifice for the gods. The smoke produced byburning cloths soaked with blood was seen as providing nourishment to the gods."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74Chapter 3 • Religious SymbolsFIGURE 3.5Yin-Yang.According to Taoist belief, yinis the female element and yangis the male element in the universe.The image of Pakal descending into the underworld to be reborn also refers to a portion ofthe Popul Vuh.The story tells of twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, who disturb the Lords of Deathby playing a ball game. They are summoned to Xibalba to participate in a series of trials, but theyare able to defeat the Lords of Death through their cunning and are then reborn.In a similar way, the symbolism of the Christian cross is based on the story of the crucifix-ion of Jesus found in the Christian Bible. The symbol of the cross also expresses the Christianworldview: that the death of Jesus provides the opportunity for salvation.And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucifiedhim, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then Jesussaid, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they parted hisraiment, and cast lots. (Luke 23:33–34)And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou beChrist, save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thoufear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for wereceive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiss. Then he saidunto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said untohim, Verily I say unto you, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise. (Luke 23:39–43)For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoeverbelieveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)Another example of the connection between symbol, myth, and worldview is the yin-yangsymbol (Figure 3.5). This symbol is based on the Taoist worldview of the importance of balanceand harmony. The Taoists believe that there are two interacting forces in the universe, called yinand yang. Yinis the female element, associated with coldness, darkness, softness, and the earth.Yangis the male element and is associated with warmth, light, hardness, and the heavens. Thetwo elements are opposites but mutually dependent, and they need to be in equilibrium. Yinandyangare believed to be present in every aspect of the world. Yet each holds the seed of the otherthat expands and becomes the other.In an ancient Chinese creation story, yinand yangwere held together in a cosmic egguntil the struggle of the opposing elements cracked the shell. A creature called P’an Ku tookform inside the egg. P’an Ku is sometimes referred to as the child of yinand yangor as thegiant of Chinese mythology. P’an Ku emerges from the egg and goes about creating the world,in several versions fashioning the earth using an adze or a hammer and chisel. But the creationof the world is not complete until P’an Ku dies, whereupon his body gives rise to variouselements. His skull becomes the dome of the sky, and his flesh becomes the soil of the earth."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 • Religious Symbols75His bones become rock; his blood, rivers; his breath, the winds; and his eyes, the sun and themoon.

In the next chapter, we will discuss rituals and theways they are intimately connected with symbols, myth, and worldview.SummaryA symbol is something that stands for somethingelse. Symbols enable us to talk about things thatare not immediately in front of us and to createour own realities. They are important elementsin religious practice, and religious rituals centeron the manipulation of symbols.Symbols can appear in many forms.Language is symbolic in nature, because variousspeech sounds are used to create combinationsthat have meaning. Yet there is nothing of the ref-erent that is inherent in the sound combination—its meaning is part of a cultural tradition. Reci-tation of religious narratives is an importantfeature of religious practices. Religious ideas alsocan be expressed in art that may contain manysymbolic elements. Much artistic representationis arbitrary in that the nature of the symbol doesnot always communicate its meaning. Simpleexamples are the swastika, the pentagram, and thecross. Although an outsider might have difficultyunderstanding a piece of religious art, a memberof that culture would have no such difficulty.Time and space are also treated symbolically.Many units of time, such as our week and the sev-eral cycles of Mayan time, are arbitrary and pro-vide time with deep meaning. Calendar systemsexist as a way of symbolically organizing timeand for scheduling periodic rituals. Space isalso full of symbolic meaning, especially whenmythological events are seen as occurring on thelandscape. Such a sacred landscape is a part of thetotemic system found among the AustralianAborigines.Music and dance are also symbolic and areimportant elements in religious ritual. Musicalelements suggest emotions and have symbolicmeanings. What is considered to be religiousmusic in one community might not be in another.Dance, composed of music, movement, costumeand masks, and props and sets, is often used to tellreligious stories in societies where such storiesare not written down. All of these elements—language, art, music, and dance—interact toprovide rich religious experiences.Suggested ReadingsNikki Bado-Fralick and Rebecca Sachs Norris, Toyingwith God: The World of Religious Games andDolls(Waco, Texas: Baylor University Press, 2010).[This book looks at religious games and dollsand the blending of religious symbols with pop-ular culture.]Norine Dresser, Multicultural Celebrations(New York:Three Rivers Press, 1999).[This is a practical book on the appropriateetiquette for celebrations in various ethnictraditions in the United States, useful in ourmulticultural society.]Carl G.

You reluctantly jump out of bed and begin your morning routine,which might include showering, shaving or putting on your makeup, reading the newspaper,and eating breakfast. You probably do the same things in the same order day after day—orat least on weekdays. This patterned, recurring sequence of events may be termed a ritual.The term ritualcan refer to any repetitive sequence of acts. Psychologists use the term whenreferring to repetitive compulsive activity, such as the ritual of washing one’s hands dozens of timesa day. A class might begin with the ritual of calling role and making announcements. However,when the ritual involves the manipulation of religious symbols such as prayers, offerings, andreadings of sacred literature, we call it a religious ritual.THE BASICS OF RITUAL PERFORMANCEIn some ways a ritual resembles a play. A play consists of actors, words, sets, and props presentedin a set way according to a script. And a play is a reflection of the culture of a society and thatsociety’s worldview.A public religious ritual also consists of actors (shamans and priests, for example), words(perhaps a prayer, a spell, or a sermon), sets (such as an altar), and props (such as candles, reli-gious books, or masks) and may contain music and dance as well. Smaller-scale rituals, such asthat performed by a shaman affecting a cure, also have many of these elements, although herethe similarity to a play is not as strong. Of course, a religious ritual is much more than a play. Itsprimary purpose is not to entertain—although in some societies rituals are an important form ofentertainment—and the audience is an active participant.Two of the most basic elements in religious practices are ritual and myth, and the two areoften closely connected. Ritual is often based on myth in that the directive to perform the ritualmay lie within the myth. The myth provides the elements for the development of the ritual.There is some debate over which came first. Myth is reflected in ritual; other rituals are reenact-ments of myth.A society’s mythology consists of stories that reflect the underlying worldview of the society.Although few people in a community can articulate in a philosophical or theological manner thebasic themes and underpinnings of their religious system, everyone is familiar with the myths oftheir religion and accepts the basic truths of the religious system. This is also true of rituals.4"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"78Chapter 4 • RitualMany rituals, though by no means all, are public rituals in which an entire community isinvolved to some degree. Ritual activities symbolize the particular beliefs and values of thatcommunity. A ritual is the vehicle by which basic ideas, such as the definition of good and eviland the proper nature of social relationships, are imparted to the group.Unlike other forms of discourse—reading this book, for example, or listening to a lecture—people attending a religious ritual usually are familiar with the ritual and also with what it means.Perhaps they have read a commentary or attended a Sunday school class that discussed themeaning of the ritual. Thus participation in the ritual signals a public acceptance of the basictenets of the religion. The mere fact that the activities that take place within the ritual are well-known and accepted lends a sense of stability to the society and imparts a sense of socialunity. Also, the fact that the elements of the ritual are repeated on a regular basis lends a sense ofvalidity and sacredness to the religious system.Prescriptive and Situational RitualsThere are many terms that we can use to describe rituals. For example, rituals may be prescrip-tive or situational. Prescriptive ritualsare rituals that are required to be performed. The require-ment may be set forth in a religious text (“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy [Exodus20:8]”), may be required by a deity or a religious authority, or may simply be based in tradition.Other rituals are performed because of a particular need of an individual or a community.These are called situational ritualsor crisis rituals. Such rituals often arise spontaneously, fre-quently in times of crisis. A community might hold a spontaneous ritual for a group of men andwomen from the community who are going off to war or engaging in some dangerous activity.The tragedy of September 11, 2001, in the United States gave rise to many situational rituals—some as simple as flying a flag, others more complex, such as the setting up of informal altarswhere people laid flowers, lit candles, and left photographs. Many churches and temples sched-uled special situational rituals to address the concerns of the community.Periodic and Occasional RitualsAnother way of describing rituals is to identify them as being performed on a regular basis aspart of a religious calendar or being performed when a particular need arises, such as a marriageor a death. The former are called periodic ritualsor calendrical rituals; the latter are calledoccasional rituals. The classification of rituals as prescribed or situational is separate from theirclassification as periodic or occasional. Thus a particular ceremony—a Sunday morning churchservice, for example—is both prescribed and periodic.Periodic rituals may be performed daily or several times a day, as in the daily prayers(salaht) of Islam. (Muslims pray at dawn, midday, midafternoon, sunset, and nightfall, as com-manded by the prophet Mohammad, which makes prayer a prescribed ritual as well.) Periodicrituals may be performed weekly, such as the Jewish ritual of the lighting of candles that occurson every Friday evening to mark the start of the Sabbath or the celebration of Sunday Mass in theCatholic Church. They also include the annual celebrations of Easter, Passover, and Ramadan.Another example of a periodic ritual is Diwali, the Festival of Lights, one of the mostimportant festivals in India. It was originally a Hindu festival, but its observance has spread, andit is celebrated as a public holiday throughout India. Diwali is celebrated on the darkest night (thenew moon) of the month of Kartik. During the festival, oil lamps are lit, and firecrackers areset off. The ritual is associated with several important mythical events. One such story is thereturn of Rama, his consort Sita, and his brother Lakshmana to their kingdom of Ayodhya aftera fourteen-year exile. To celebrate their return, the people of Ayodhya are said to have lit up their"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual79houses with oil lamps. The lights that are associated with this festival are said to symbolize theremoval of spiritual darkness.The celebration of Diwali was probably originally related to the harvest season. Manyperiodic rituals are aligned with the phases of the agricultural cycle. This is the basis of the timingof many religious rituals in the Jewish and Christian religious calendars. The most importantrituals are associated with the periods of sowing and harvesting.For example, Passover is a Jewish commemoration of the exodus of the Israelites fromEgypt. However, many historians believe that this holiday was also originally a spring agriculturalfestival. This can be seen in many of the symbolic foods associated with the Passover Seder, orritual meal, such as parsley. Exactly seven weeks after the Passover holiday is Shavuot. Shavuot isalso known as Yom Habikkurim, or the Day of the First Fruits, and commemorates both thebeginning of the wheat harvest and the giving of the Ten Commandments to Moses at Mount Sinai.Occasional rituals are rituals that are performed for a specific purpose when a situationarises that requires the ritual to be performed. Many occasional rituals are associated with natureand the impact of nature on the agricultural cycle. These include rituals to control an infestationof insect pests or to bring rain, performed when crops are threatened or when rain does not come.Occasional rituals are also associated with important events in the life of an individual. Theseinclude rituals marking birth, marriage, and death.A Classification of RitualsOur next step is to group the subjects of our study, in this case rituals, into a manageable numberof categories. This can be very difficult when the variation is great, and any classification is to anextent arbitrary. Here we will discuss many of the different kinds of rituals using some of thecategories developed by Anthony F. C. Wallace.1A list of rituals can be found in Table 4.1.TABLE 4.1A Classification of RitualsTechnological RitualsRituals that attempt to influence or control natureHunting and GatheringRites of IntensificationRituals that influence nature in the quest for food.Protective RitualsRituals designed to protect the safety of people engaged indangerous activities.Divination RitualsRituals that seek information about the unknown.Therapy RitualsRituals that deal with illness, accident, and death.Therapy RitualsHealing rituals.Anti-Therapy RitualsRituals that bring about illness, accident, or death.Ideological RitualsRituals that serve to maintain the normal functioning ofa community.Social Rites ofIntensificationRituals that delineate codes of proper behavior and articulate thecommunity’s worldview.Rites of PassageRituals that accompany changes in an individual’s status in society.Salvation RitualsRituals that focus on the religious experience of an individual.Revitalization RitualsRituals that focus on the elimination of alien customs anda return to a native way of life."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"80Chapter 4 • RitualA SURVEY OF RITUALSEach type of ritual has its own goal and exists within its own cultural and religious context. In thenext section we will survey most of the types of rituals found in Wallace’s classification, alongwith cultural examples.Technological RitualsTechnological ritualsare rituals that attempt to influence or control nature, especially in activi-ties that affect human activities and well-being. The success or failure of human endeavors suchas hunting, fishing, and farming is influenced by the vagaries of nature. Game animals might notbe located; fish might fail to take the bait; the lack of rain might cause a crop to wither and die.Because these events affect the very survival of a people, all societies attempt to influence oreven to control nature so as to ensure the success of the hunt, fishing expeditions, or cultivation.Examples of technological rituals include hunting and gathering rites of intensification, protec-tive rituals, and divination rituals.HUNTING AND GATHERING RITES OF INTENSIFICATION.The function of hunting andgathering rites of intensificationis to influence nature in the quest for food. Although the namerefers to hunting and gathering activities, these rituals also extend to other economic activitiessuch as fishing, herding, and farming. They include periodic rituals that follow the seasonal cycleand occasional rituals performed in response to some crisis such as lack of rain. They mayinitiate the hunting of particular animal species as they migrate at different seasons through atraditional territory. At the start of a fishing trip, such rituals are performed to ensure success inlocating fish. Rituals accompany the preparation of the soil, the planting of seeds, the protectionof the growing crop from the elements and wild animals, and the harvest.Among hunting and gathering peoples the commencement of the time when particularwild foods are available is often marked by ritual. On a practical level, these rituals serve toregulate the gathering of that food. The premature gathering of a particular type of fruit, forexample, might negatively affect the total amount of fruit that is available. They also reaffirm therights of particular social units to specific foods and areas of food gathering. These rituals arefrequently referred to as “first-fruit ceremonies.” Among the Cahuilla of the southern Californiadesert, individuals would be sent out to gather small amounts of food. Food left from the winterstores would be added, and members of each kin group would eat a ritual portion of the food in aceremony thanking the supernatural for providing the food in a ceremony that lasted three daysand three nights.Fertility is a central theme in this group of rituals, be it the successful sprouting and growthof crops in the spring or the birth of wild animals, without which people would go hungry andsocieties would die. When people are successful in the hunt, rituals are performed to thank theanimal for allowing itself to be caught.The Lakota are a Native American tribe living today in the north-central United States. Inthe early nineteenth century they were hunters of the buffalo. Today, although wild herds of buf-falo have disappeared from the plains, the Lakota manage herds of captive buffalo and sell theirmeat as a major source of income. Occasionally, an uncontrollable animal must be killed, whichtoday is accomplished by a shotgun rather than a bow and arrow. But when the animal has died,the hunters gather around the body and perform a simple ritual to thank the buffalo for permittingitself to be killed, thus ensuring the continuing success of the enterprise."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual81The Inuit, who live on the Arctic coast, depend on seals for their survival. The myths andrituals of the Inuit reflect this connection. The creation of seals is the subject of an importantcreation myth.2Long ago, there lived in the Arctic a young and beautiful woman. Many men werepresented to her as prospective husbands, but she rejected them all, until one day ahandsome stranger came to her family’s camp. He had many dogs and finely craftedhunting tools, and he promised her a life of comfort. She could not resist, and she leftwith him for his land across the sea, only to find on her arrival that she had beendeceived. Her betrothed was in fact a seabird, and his dwelling was a hovel. Whenher father came to rescue her, they escaped in his boat across the calm sea. But herseabird husband’s spirit, angered by this, pursued them and whipped the icy sea intoa raging storm. In midocean in a small boat, the father feared for his life and, toappease the bird, cast his daughter overboard into the wave-tossed waters. Butshe clung relentlessly to the gunwale of his boat. Determined to release her grip,the father cut off her fingers at the first knuckle; the pieces fell into the sea andbecame the ringed seals. Still she held on. Then he cut all her fingers at thesecond joint, and those pieces swam away as bearded seals. Other pieces of herfingers became walruses and whales. That is how seals were created, and thatyoung woman became Nuliajuk, the Mother of the Sea....To this day she lives at thebottom of the sea and controls all the animals in her watery domain.The success of a seal hunt among the Inuit depends on the benevolence of the Mother ofthe Sea. If important customs are neglected, she can cause many difficulties for hunters such asstorms or breaking up of the ice. She might also keep the seals out of the reach of the hunters.The Inuit believe that Nuliajuk is at her happiest when her hair is neat, and the misbehavior ofpeople is seen as tangling her hair. Because her fingers were cut off and became the seals, shecannot tend to her hair herself and it is the role of the shaman to visit her in her home at thebottom of the sea to comb her hair and thereby appease her.The traditional Inuit belief is that seals have a soul, and many Inuit hunting customs andrituals are designed to show respect for the seals. One example is the practice in many Inuitgroups of placing fresh water into the mouth of a dead seal before it is butchered. Some groupsbelieved that a seal that was given a drink was more likely to return again as another seal foranother drink, but the general belief across the groups was that the drink would appease the spirit of the seal.In the words of an Inuit, Peter Irniq, “Inuit were extremely respectful toward seals. Myfather used to catch a seal and put it into our iglu. Before my mother skinned the seal she wouldput a piece of ice in her own mouth to melt, then let the meltwater fall into the dead seal’s mouth.She said this was to make sure the seals under the ice will not be thirsty. She did this every time.It’s a spiritual belief, done out of respect for the seals.”3PROTECTIVE RITUALS.There are numerous potential dangers that accompany risky activities.Imagine traveling in a small dugout canoe out on the ocean, out of sight of land, looking forproductive fishing grounds, with no real ability to predict the weather more than a few hours inadvance, if that. Protective ritualsusually accompany such activities, and they may be prescrip-tive in that they are routinely performed at the start of a dangerous activity or occasionally inresponse to a gathering storm."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"82Chapter 4 • RitualThese are rituals designed to protect the safety of the people who are involved in danger-ous tasks. Protective rituals are also performed in response to some unexpected threat to thesuccess of an economic endeavor. Such threats might include an infestation of insect peststhreatening to destroy a crop, floods and droughts, sick animals in a herd, and many otherpotential crises too numerous to name.The ocean trading journeys of the Trobriand Islanders of New Guinea are dangerous.There are numerous concerns, including ensuring the seaworthiness of canoes and the desire forgood weather. These voyages are accompanied by a great number of rituals. The canoe captain isnot only an expert on navigation and weather prediction, but also a ritual specialist, performingrituals throughout the voyage. As an example, some rituals that are performed before the launch-ing of a canoe are rituals for expelling the heaviness out of a canoe, rituals to make the canoemore seaworthy, and rituals to make the canoe fast, in part by making other canoes slow.Rituals for the protection of boats on the open ocean are common among seagoing peoples.The Vikings christened a new ship by “blooding the keel,” which involved a ritual humansacrifice in which a person was tied to the keel of the boat, to be crushed beneath it when the boatwas launched. The Western practice of christening a new ship by breaking a bottle of champagnestill carries with it the idea of a blessing from God, and the person who does the christeningenters into a special relationship with the ship.Protective rituals are also used for other modes of transportation. Among the Yoruba ofNigeria in West Africa, Ogun is the god of iron. More recently, Ogun has also become associatedwith cars and trucks. It is common for taxi drivers to decorate their cars with his symbols and evenon occasion to offer an animal sacrifice to him asking for his protection.Often it is not actual control that is needed. Foreknowledge of natural events that affect thesuccess of economic efforts can lead to preventive measures, be they technical (building a fenceto keep wild animals out of the field) or ritual. Such ceremonies assist communities in selectingthe best time to plant or the best place to locate game or fish. Rituals that seek information arereferred to as divination rituals. Divination will be discussed in detail in Chapter 7.Social Rites of IntensificationThe next group of rituals serves to maintain the normal functioning of a community. These aretermed ideological rituals. They delineate codes of proper behavior; define good and evil, moraland immoral; and articulate the community’s worldview. They assist people and the communityin getting through times of change and times of crisis. They facilitate the orderly running of thesociety. They tend to be conservative, sanctioning the social order.An important type of ideological ritual is the social rite of intensification. These are veryfamiliar rituals. They are usually prescribed and periodic and include the weekly Sunday morn-ing church service found in most Christian denominations, the Jewish Sabbath rituals, and thedaily prayer or salahtof Islam. They also include major annual rituals such as the ChristianEaster and the Jewish Rosh Hashanah. Elements that are frequently found in social rites of inten-sification that are most familiar to us include the reading of sections of the sacred text; a sermon,commenting on some aspects of the sacred text, commentary on current crises, or a discussion ofmoral issues; and prayers to the deity.Some rituals have aspects that can be classified in more than one category. A good exampleof this is a funeral ritual, which is often both a rite of passage for the individual who has died(discussed in the next subsection) and a rite of intensification for those who remain. A death is atime of crisis for the group. The funeral ritual brings people together and reaffirms the existence"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual83of the social group and its values. This is seen most clearly when we examine the ritualssurrounding the death of a chief or king. The death affects the entire community and ushers in aperiod of potential instability. In the absence of a strong leader, the group may be vulnerable tointernal strife. Enemies may take advantage of both the lack of strong leadership and the fact thatthe focus of the community is on the death.Among the Swazi of the East African Cattle culture area, the death of a king has the poten-tial of precipitating a major crisis. The prosperity of the Swazi nation is bound up with the healthand virility of the king, and during his life the king must avoid all contact with death. He may notvisit a grave or touch a dead body and may mourn the passing of a close relative for only a fewdays. Individuals living in his household are removed from the homestead when they becomevery ill so that they will not die in the king’s presence. The death of the king is kept secret until acouncil of kin has made the selection of an heir. Only after the heir has been installed as the newking will the burial of the old king proceed. Following the period of mourning, rituals are held torejuvenate and revitalize the Swazi nation.Another example of the element of a social rite of intensification in a funeral ritual is theJewish practice of reciting the kaddish.The kaddishis known as a mourner’s prayer, but varia-tions on this prayer are recited at many other times, and the prayer itself actually says nothingabout death or mourning. This prayer is a reaffirmation of faith in the face of a great loss. Theprayer begins, “May His great Name grow exalted and sanctified in the world that He created asHe willed. May He give reign to His kingship in your lifetime and in your days, and in thelifetimes of the entire family of Israel, swiftly and soon. May His great Name be blessed foreverand ever.” Similarly, the simple practice of gathering at the home of the mourner after a funeralservice can be seen as reaffirming important group ties.OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES.One of the functions of social rites of intensification, andother rituals as well, is to communicate with the deity. One way of doing this is throughprayer; another is through offeringsand sacrifices. Offerings and sacrifices can be viewed inmany ways. They may be gifts or even bribes, or economic exchange designed to influence thesupernatural. The supernatural in turn will reciprocate with rain, healing, economic success,and so on. Of course this is in no way coercion, and the deity is free to reject the gift.In many societies, reciprocity plays an important role in social relationships. Importantsocial events, such as marriages, are celebrated with gift-giving and feasting. In these societiesthis type of behavior is projected into the supernatural world where a harmonious and mutuallyadvantageous relationship between the society and the supernatural will be expressed in terms ofmutual reciprocity between humans and their gods.The essential difference between a sacrifice and an offering is that in sacrifice blood isshed; that is, an animal, which may be a human being, is killed. All other gifts are offerings. Theitem that is offered is usually an object of some economic value and its offering often involveseconomic hardship for the individual or group making the offering. It therefore becomes specialor even sacred. However, some of the economic value may be recovered as when, for example,food that is offered on an altar is later consumed by those making the offering. Of course, thisdoes not happen when the offering is destroyed, as when it is burned.HUMAN SACRIFICE.Aztec society (Mesoamerican culture area) was based on agriculture andwas highly stratified. The Aztecs believed that the life of the Sun was about to end and tried toavoid that by providing the sacred food that the sun needed: blood. Human sacrifice on a largescale was an important part of Aztec religion."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"84Chapter 4 • RitualA ritual would begin with a four-day (or some multiple of four) period of preparation.During this time, priests would fast and make offerings of such items as food, cloth, and incense.The ritual itself would be preceded by a dramatic procession. The participants, elaboratelycostumed and accompanied by music ensembles, would walk to the specific temple of sacrifice.All important rituals involved the sacrifice of either animals or humans.The ritual human sacrificial victims were called in ixiptla in teteo, or deity impersonators,as the belief was that they were transformed into gods. They would be ritually bathed, speciallycostumed to impersonate the specific deity to whom they were being sacrificed, and taught spe-cial dances. A wide range of techniques were used in sacrifice, including decapitation, drowning,strangulation, shooting with arrows, combat, and throwing from heights. Commonly, the victimwas led up the temple stairs to the sacrificial stone (techcatl). There the victim would be helddown by four priests, and the temple priest would cut through the victim’s chest to remove thestill-beating heart, referred to as “precious eagle cactus fruit.” The heart would then be offered tothe sun for nourishment. This was sometimes followed by the body’s being rolled back down thetemple steps, where it was often dismembered, flayed, and eaten.Therapy Rituals and HealingOf all tragedies that may befall a people, perhaps the most disturbing and disruptive are illnessesand accidents that lead to incapacity or death. All peoples have theories about the cause of illnessand accident, and these are associated with techniques, including rituals, for dealing with them.There are a number of methods for dealing with accidents and illnesses that are technicalrather than religious. For example, many traditional healers know how to set bones, and many of theplant materials that are administered as medicines have been found to have genuine medical value.The anthropological study of medicinal plants is part of the study of ethnobotany. Such studieshave led to the development of several drug therapies. Some plant material has been known forcenturies to have some pharmaceutical properties, such as digitalis from the foxglove plant, whichis used to treat heart problems. More recently, the drug taxol, derived from the bark and needles ofthe Pacific yew tree, has been used for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Northwest Coast NativeAmerican tribes traditionally treated a variety of diseases with medicines derived from this tree.Many illnesses cannot be dealt with through technology, especially in traditional societies.Various theories of illness give rise to many types of cures that include ritual. Rituals that focus oncuring are called therapy rituals. These are among the most important rituals found in manysocieties. The type of ritual will depend on the cause of the illness, with the cause frequently beingdiscovered by means of divination. Some of the supernatural causes of illness and their treatment willbe discussed at length in later chapters, but Table 4.2 lists those that are most frequently encountered.TABLE 4.2Causes and Treatment of Supernatural IllnessesCause of IllnessTherapy RitualObject intrusionMassage and sucking to remove objectSpirit intrusionExorcismSoul lossSoul retrievalBreach of tabuConfessionWitchcraftAnti-witchcraft ritualsSpirits and godsSacrifices and offerings"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual85THE NAVAHO.As we discussed in Chapter 2, the Navaho worldview stresses the importance ofbalance and harmony. When this balance is upset, something bad, usually illness, is the result.Balance is upset by human actions, and the specific nature of the transgression will determine howthe illness will manifest itself. The Navaho have separate specialists for diagnosis and treatment.Diagnosis is done by hand tremblers, who are generally women. The healers are usually men.The entire family or even the entire community will gather together for the therapy ritual, whichlasts anywhere from one to nine days. Prayers, medicine, songs, and herbs in addition to sandpaintings are used to restore balance and harmony and thus cure the illness (Figure 4.1). The Navahoword for sand painting is ikaah,which means “a summoning of the gods.” They believe that if aprayer is offered with a good heart and is correct in every detail, the gods are compelled to answer it. If they do not answer, there must have been some imperfection in the sand painting or the ceremony.The sand painting itself depicts a specific portion of the complex Navaho mythology.Usually, this is a story of a hero who encounters some misfortune, but with help from others, usuallya supernatural being, the hero recovers and learns how to heal the same problem in others. Thestory also is recounted in long, complex chants. This example again shows the relationship betweenritual, myth, and worldview.ANTI-THERAPY RITUALS.Anti-therapy ritualsare rituals that bring about illness, accident, ordeath. When directed toward a member of one’s own community, the behavior is clearly antisocial.The person responsible needs to be identified, usually through divination, stopped, and punished.FIGURE 4.1Navaho Sand Painting.A partially completed sand painting with bowls of ground,colored rock."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86Chapter 4 • RitualHowever, when directed toward an enemy, an anti-therapy ritual may support an objective of thesociety. Among the Yanomamö of northern South America, warfare is carried out with spears andarrows, as well as through ritual activities that send illness-causing spirits into the bodies of theirenemies.An anti-therapy ritual of the Fore of New Guinea was described in Chapter 1. A sorcerertakes something connected to the victim, such as a piece of clothing, and places it in a bundle,recites a spell, and puts the bundle in the cold, muddy ground. As a result, the victim becomes illwith the disease kuru.Perhaps one of the best-known examples of an anti-therapy ritual is the bone-pointingritual found among the Australian Aborigines. This is sometimes referred to as a cursing ritual.Taking a kangaroo bone, the individual performing the ritual sharpens one end and drills a holethrough the other. He takes a strand of the victim’s hair, and puts it through the hole and securesit with a knot. Then, in public, the performer points the bone at the victim. Here is a descriptionof what happens next.4A man who discovers that he is being boned by an enemy is, indeed, a pitiable sight.He stands aghast, with his eyes staring at the treacherous pointer, and with his handslifted as though to ward off the lethal medium, which he imagines is pouring into hisbody. His cheeks blanch and his eyes become glassy, and the expression on his facebecomes horribly distorted. . . . He attempts to shriek, but usually the sound chokesin his throat, and all one might see is froth at his mouth. His body begins to trembleand the muscles twist involuntarily. He sways backwards and falls to the ground, andfor a short time appears to be in a swoon; but soon after he begins to writhe as if inmortal agony, and covering his face with his hands, begins to moan. After a while hebecomes more composed and crawls to his wurley [hut]. From this time onwardshe sickens and frets, refusing to eat, and keeping aloof from the daily affairs of thetribe. Unless help is forthcoming in the shape of a counter-charm, administeredby the hands of the “Nangarri,” or medicine-man, his death is only a matter of acomparatively short time.Salvation RitualsSalvation ritualsfocus on the religious experience of an individual. It is a broad categorythat includes a number of rituals in which an individual is changed in some way, temporarilyor permanently. One example would be a ritual involving spirit possession in which, as acentral part of the ritual, the individual’s body is temporarily taken over by some god orspirit. Or perhaps the main focus of the ritual is to have some mystical experience such asthose achieved in an altered state of consciousness (Chapter 5). Sometimes the change ispermanent, as when a shaman is being initiated. This group of rituals also includes rituals tocounter the effects of breaking a tabu or some other religious obligation. Several examples ofsalvation rituals will be given in later chapters, including the use of peyote among theHuichol and in the Native American Church (Chapter 5) and spirit possession in Vodou(Chapter 11).Revitalization RitualsRevitalization ritualsare associated with revitalization movements. These include nativisticmovements, which focus on the elimination of alien customs and a return to the native way of"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual87life, and messianic movements, which involve the participation of a divine savior in human flesh.These rituals are often associated with social movements and usually develop within a context ofrapid culture change. We will discuss revitalization rituals in detail in Chapter 11.Rites of PassageAmong the most-studied rituals by anthropologists are rites of passage, a type of ideologicalritual. A society consists of a number of individuals who are related to one another and interactwith one another in complex ways. We can think of a society as being composed of a series ofpositions, each one defined in terms of appropriate behavior, rights and obligations, and relation-ships to one another. Each position is known as a status. Examples of statuses include mother,husband, teacher, blacksmith, mayor, and priest. Of course, a person can occupy more than onestatus. One person can be a mother, a wife, and a teacher, depending on the social context. Herewe are using the term statusto refer to a social position, not to the relative placement of eachposition in the society. The term rankis used for this latter purpose.When a person changes his or her status in the society—becomes an adult, marries, enters aprofession, or attains political office—the individual alters his or her social relationship with othermembers of the society. Such changes might require that the individual dress in a new way, speakin a different fashion, and behave toward certain people in new ways. Making these changes canbe difficult for the individual. They often are marked and facilitated by rites of passage.Rites of passage imprint the change in a person’s social status on the minds of the partici-pants and grant community approval or legitimacy for the change. In a literate society such asours, all one truly needs is a legal piece of paper. A couple can fly to Las Vegas or go to the localcourthouse and be married with a brief ceremony, without the presence of family or other commu-nity members. It is the marriage license, not the ceremony, which establishes the legality of thechange in status and inserts the event in the legal record of some political unit. This is not the casein nonliterate communities, where the combined witnesses and participation of family and com-munity are required. Most couples in Western culture choose to get married in this manner as well.Some rites of passage are very familiar. These include rites marking a person’s progressionthrough the life cycle. All cultures have terminology to refer to the phases of one’s life—infant,child, adult, and senior, for example. However, these divisions of the life cycle are more formaland clear-cut in some societies than in others. As a person moves from one category to the next,the event may be marked by ritual.The life cycle begins with birth ceremonies designed to ensure the safety and well-being of thechild. Through these rituals the child becomes an integral part of the community. However, in soci-eties with a high infant death rate, the introduction of the child to the community may be delayed. A child may be kept in isolation and is considered a nonperson until she survives for a certain periodof time. In traditional societies the child might then be presented to the family and other members ofthe community, receive a name, perhaps be passed over the smoke of a fire and have strings tiedaround her wrists to prevent the child from falling ill. Examples of birth rituals in our society arebaptism in Catholicism, by which the child becomes a member of a Catholic community, and theJewish circumcisionceremony whereby a male child becomes a member of the Jewish community.The next major transition is that from childhood into adulthood. These coming-of-ageceremonies include confirmations, quinceañeras,bar mitzvahs, and bat mitzvahs. Other impor-tant life cycle ceremonies are marriage and death rituals. In addition to life cycle ceremonies,rites of passage mark initiation into social groups (such as fraternity initiations) or religious orpolitical office (such as a presidential inauguration)."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88Chapter 4 • RitualTHE STRUCTURE OF A RITE OF PASSAGE.A familiar example of a rite of passage is thewedding in the United States, which actually consists of a series of rituals performed over aperiod of time. Although there is considerable variation among various segments of U.S. society,there is a general pattern found in many weddings. We will use this example to describe thestructure of a rite of passage.Anthropologists identify three phases in the typical rite of passage. The first phase is calledseparation. In this phase the individual is removed from his or her former status. In some ritualsthis is an abrupt separation of the individual from the community; in others it may take placeover a longer period of time.For weddings in the United States, the separation phase is actually a series of events thattake place over the period of time preceding the ceremony. A typical wedding cycle might beginwith an engagement party. Next follows a number of planning and preparation activities,frequently involving wedding specialists. Although these are usually thought of as practical,logistical activities, they often take on the characteristics of ritual in that they consist of traditionalactivities. These include the selection of a wedding dress, costuming the wedding party, selectingand mailing invitations, signing up with a gift registry, attending wedding showers, the rehearsal,and the rehearsal dinner. The final event in the separation phase is when the bride walks down theaisle and bids farewell to her parents and, in some ceremonies, is formally “given away” by herfather and/or mother or other close relative.The second step is the transitionphase. During the transition phase, several activities takeplace that bring about the change in status. In the American wedding, this phase, which is theactual ceremony, lasts from only a few minutes to over an hour. This is relatively short whencompared with rites of passage found in other societies, in which the transition phase can lastmonths or even years.At the conclusion of the transition phase, the person conducting the American weddingceremony often will introduce the newly married couple to the congregation as “Mr. and Mrs.”Thus begins the final phase, incorporation, during which the couple reenters normal society,though in a new social relationship. This stage includes the reception or party celebrating themarriage. The incorporation phase usually lasts several hours, although in many groups it isconsiderably longer. After the reception there is often a series of additional activities, such as adisplay of gifts and the writing of thank-you notes.All of this can be quite daunting and very expensive. Of course, in our society a couplecan fly to Las Vegas or go to the local courthouse and get the piece of paper and skip mostof the traditional activities. However, many couples and their families are very uncomfortablewith this and will follow such a legal wedding with some type of celebration to reaffirm themarriage, such as a reception or perhaps a second wedding ceremony attended by friendsand family.COMING-OF-AGE RITUALS.A ritual that frequently assumes great importance in traditionalsocieties is the coming-of-age ritual, which marks the transition from childhood to adulthood.An example is the rite of passage that accompanies menarche, or a girl’s first menstruation.Menarche is only one physiological event within a complex cycle of events we call puberty thatextends over several years. However, menarche is a very definite, easily observed event.Because puberty is so well marked in females, the ritual is sometimes an individual ritualrather than for a group of girls at one time. The announcement of first menstruation by a girl toher mother may initiate the separation phase. Among the Yanomamö of South America, a girl"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual89who is menstruating for the first time is secluded in a simple enclosure built in the corner of herdwelling. The transition period lasts three days, during which the girl sits on the floor eatinglittle. She shaves her head and removes her ornaments in an effort to look as unattractive aspossible. This is done to prevent evil spirits from seducing the girl and taking her away to bemarried, leaving behind her dead body. At the end of this period she is incorporated into thecommunity. She cleans herself and puts on a new apron and ornaments. She is now considered tobe an adult female member of the community.Female coming-of-age rituals may also occur as a group ritual. In this case the ritualusually occurs several years before the onset of puberty to ensure that the ritual is completedbefore the onset of menstruation.Initiation rituals for boys are often more elaborate than those for girls. Because boys lack aclearly defined physiological event to mark the onset of puberty, the timing of male initiation isfairly arbitrary. Male initiation rituals are usually group rituals in which all of the boys of acertain age range in a community are periodically rounded up to go through the ritual as a group.Male initiation ceremonies are usually characterized by relatively short separation andincorporation phases. The separation phase may be very sudden, as when masked dancers tearthe boys away from their families without warning. The incorporation phase may simply be areintroduction of the boys, now occupying their new status as men, to the community, followedby feasting.TRANSITION AND LIMINALITY.Initiates in the transition stage, especially in those rituals inwhich this stage lasts for a significant period of time, are in an out-of-the-ordinary situation.They have shed their previous identification and place in society but have yet to take on themantle of their new status. Their ambiguous position and the fact that they are marginal to theirsociety—often in a real sense if they are removed to a special camp away from the village—arerepresented symbolically.An often-encountered metaphor for a rite of passage is the cycle of death and rebirth.Separation is symbolized by death, and incorporation by rebirth. The period of time betweendeath and rebirth is a time of mystery during which the initiate undergoes a metamorphosis fromone kind of human being to another. Just as the process of change within an insect’s cocoon ishidden from view and therefore mysterious, the activities surrounding the transitional phase maybe hidden from view from women and uninitiated boys.Initiates within this transition period are said to be in a liminal state. Liminalityis the stateof ambiguous marginality during which the metamorphosis takes place. As such, it is symboli-cally represented by a number of attributes. Victor Turner provides us with a list of features thatcharacterize the liminal state. The first column in Table 4.3 lists some of the properties of limi-nality, which are contrasted in the second column with the normal state.An important feature of the state of liminality is summed up by the term communitas.Within this state not only is there a sense of equality, but the mere fact that a group of individuals ismoving through the process together brings about a sense of community and camaraderie. This iswhat occurs in the Islamic hajj,in which all pilgrims wear the same white garments and performthe same rituals regardless of wealth or social standing. The sense of belonging transcends thetremendous ethnic diversity of the pilgrims who gather together from all over the world.In many traditional societies the boys who are initiated together form very close bonds andwill usually remain close friends throughout their lives. In some African societies this group of maleswill form a formal group known as an age set.Age sets cut across other group boundaries, such as"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90Chapter 4 • RitualTABLE 4.3Characteristics of LiminalityLiminalityNormal StateTransitionStateCommunitasStructureEqualityInequalityAnonymitySystems of nomenclatureAbsence of propertyPropertyAbsence of statusStatusNakedness or uniform clothingDistinctions of clothingSexual continenceSexualityAbsence of rankDistinctions of rankHumilityJust pride of positionDisregard for personal appearanceCare for personal appearanceUnselfishnessSelfishnessTotal obedienceObedience only to superior rankSacrednessSecularitySilenceSpeechSimplicityComplexityAcceptance of pain and sufferingAvoidance of pain and sufferingSource:Adapted from Victor Turner, “Liminality and Communitas,” in The Ritual Process: Structure andAnti-Structure(Chicago: Aldine, 1969), pp. 94–113, 125–130.clans and lineages, and create solidarity between groups that often are opposed to one another. Agesets serve a number of functions and may serve as important social units, such as military units.Members of an age set may move together through various age grades. An age gradeisa specific status defined by age, such as warrior or elder. We can think of a system of age grades asa classification of an individual into age categories. An individual or a group such as an age set willmove through a series of age grades during his or her life. Here the distinction is more complexthan just a transition from child to adult, and rites of passage often mark the entrance into eachage grade.APACHE RITE OF PASSAGE.The coming-of-age ceremony for Apache (Southwest culturearea) girls is a periodic ritual, held every July. The ritual lasts four days, mirroring the four daysof creation. For the duration of the ceremony the girls are seen as reincarnations of the cultureheroine White Painted Woman. The Apache say that White Painted Woman first appeared as ayoung girl, arriving from the east. She grew to adulthood, during which time she was associatedwith the south. As she grew older, she was associated with the west, the direction taken by thosewho die. As a very old woman she was associated with the north. However, after she died, sheappeared again the next day as a young woman in the east. Thus White Painted Woman symbol-izes the cycle of women’s lives. The girls wear special costumes that contain many items sym-bolic of White Painted Woman."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual91Every evening there is singing and dancing. On the first night the songs refer to the first dayof creation and so on until the last evening. The ritual that is performed on the fourth night is calledpulling the sun.This ritual must be carefully planned and timed. The ritual specialists, known assingers, sing four sun-pulling songs, moving their hands, which have been painted with sunsymbols, into different positions. As the last verse of the song is sung, the singers raise their handsover their heads. As the last note is sung, the sun rises over the mountains and falls on the singers’raised hands.After this ritual is completed, the girls run back to the places where they are staying during theritual, but they are not seen doing this because four large poles that were erected at the start of theceremony now come crashing down, causing the other people to turn and look at the source ofthe noise. The next time the girls are seen, they are adult women. As the final component, the girl’ssinger comes to the girl to recite her genealogy to her. The Apache are a matrilineal society, tracingkinship through the women. The singer places three small bits of food in the girl’s mouth, and hergodmother places a fourth bit of food. This symbolizes the girl being fed by all the women, of alltime, of her tribe.U.S. SECULAR RITES OF PASSAGE.In the United States we find a number of secular ritesof passage and other nonreligious activities that have many of the characteristics of rites ofpassage. One of these is basic military training, which has many of the characteristics ofcoming-of-age rites in tribal societies. The recruits are physically removed to an isolated andspecial place, the military base, where they shed their civilian clothing, have their hair cut, andare issued a standardized uniform. Civilian occupational specializations and socioeconomicranks become irrelevant. The actual training has many of the features of transition, includingthe development of communitas, equality, total obedience, acceptance of pain, and many otherfeatures of liminality listed in Table 4.3. Graduation from basic training would be the beginningof incorporation. However, there is one major difference between military training and tribalcoming-of-age rituals. After completing military service, the individuals often return to thestatus they occupied before induction and undergo a period of readjustment during which theydiscard their military identity.Another example is the experience of a patient entering a hospital. Separation begins whenthe patient enters the hospital and has his clothes taken away from him and is given a standard-ized “uniform.” The actual medical procedures represent transitions as the individual is in someway changed. Some of the experiences of the patient resemble features of a liminal state.Discharge represents incorporation. However, unlike the typical rite of passage, the processseldom results in a permanent change of status that is acknowledged by the society, exceptperhaps in the case of permanent disability.Alterations of the Human BodyAll peoples have cultural images of themselves that serve to separate them from the rest of theanimal world. Physical appearance serves to distinguish individuals socially with regard to suchattributes as gender, age, social status, and occupation as well as membership in age and socialgroups. Many rituals involve temporary alterations of the human body, as when paint is applied tothe body to symbolize that an individual is in a liminal state. Changes in status through rites ofpassage are often marked with changes in dress and hair style that mark the individual’s new status.Other alterations are more permanent changes to the human body. The process of produc-ing the alteration creates a situation in which the individual must endure a painful procedure."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92Chapter 4 • RitualBeing able to have one’s body cut, pierced, tattooed, and scarred without showing pain is often acritical element in rites of passage. The experience and acceptance of pain is an important featureof liminality, and this pain may play a role in developing an altered state of consciousness(Chapter 5), an important aspect of a ritual experience.TATTOOING AND OTHER PERMANENT ALTERATIONS.The history of tattooing in Americanand European cultures can be traced to the voyages of James Cook in the eighteenth century.Many of Cook’s sailors were tattooed during their stay in Tahiti, and the word tattoois derivedfrom the Tahitian word ta-tu,meaning “to mark or strike.” Tattooing involves piercing or cuttingthe skin and then introducing a pigment into the wound. In contemporary Western societies thisis done with an electronic device, but the principle is the same (Figure 4.2a).The social implications of tattooing in Western society have varied. At times it has been afad among the aristocracy or members of particular social groups, such as sailors, gangs, andprisoners. In this context a tattoo served as a mark of social identity. At other times tattooing hasbeen a way to express dissatisfaction with the social order and was a way to distance oneselffrom the mainstream society. Tattoos also serve a religious purpose when one places a religioussymbol or a memorial to a loved one permanently on their skin.Closely related to tattooing is cicatrizationor scarification. This is frequently seen inpeoples with dark skin on whom tattoos would not show well. In scarification, a piece of skin israised and cut, and some material, such as ash, is rubbed in to encourage the production of scars.Closely related to cicatrization is branding, in which the scars are created by burns.Another common alteration of the body involves piercing some body part (Figure 4.2b).Many American women, and some men, bore holes into their earlobes to hang earrings. The holemay be enlarged so that a plug can be inserted, or weights may be attached so that the earlobewill be stretched. A few societies pierce the lower lip and insert a round plate. People may alsopierce their nose, eyebrow, lips, tongue, nipples, and even genitals. A society matron mightpierce her ears to wear fashionable diamond earrings; her rebellious child might pierce his noseor eyebrow as a symbolic act of rebellion; a youth from the Amazon may have his ears pierced aspart of a coming-of-age ritual.FIGURE 4.2Alterations of the Human Body.(a) Maori (New Zealand) facial tattoos, earlytwentieth century; (b) man from San Francisco showing tattoos, pierced nose, and piercedand stretched earlobes; (c) Mangbetu (Democratic Republic of the Congo) woman withelongated head holding infant with ropes bound around head."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual93Some societies see white teeth as resembling the teeth of animals. To create a boundarybetween humans and nonhuman animals, teeth are often knocked out, filed into various shapes,or colored, most often blackened. Other body parts can be removed, most frequently a fingerjoint. The bones of the skull in infants are quite pliable, and pressure on these bones will causethem to deform. Sometimes such deformation results unintentionally from various practices suchas the flattening of the back of the head in infants on cradleboards. In other societies, such as theMaya, the heads of infants born into high social classes were deliberately bound to alter theirshape (Figure 4.2c).GENITAL CUTTING.Circumcision, the removal of the foreskin of the penis, is commonly foundin many cultures. In Judaism the circumcision ceremony is referred to as a Berit Mila(oftencalled a bris). Beritmeans covenant and Milameans to cut, so a Berit Milacuts, as in marks, thecovenant with God. The ritual is a prescriptive one and is based on a passage from Genesis:And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my Covenant, you and yourdescendants after you throughout their generations. This is My Covenant which youshall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male amongyou shall be circumcised. You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, andit shall be a sign of the Covenant between Me and you. He that is eight days oldamong you shall be circumcised; every male throughout your generations.” (Genesis17:9–12)The circumcision is performed by a ritual specialist, known as a mohel.The ritual also includesa formal naming of the child. For girls the ceremony is called a Brit Bat(or Covenant ofDaughters) and includes the naming portion only.Circumcision is also traditional in Islam. However, here circumcision often takes placelater, frequently around the age of seven, although the age varies from soon after birth to the timeof puberty. In the latter case the circumcision ritual becomes a true puberty ritual.There are other modifications of the penis found in many traditional cultures. Perhaps thebest known is subincision. In subincision the underside of the penis is cut and the urethra slitopen. The length of the slit varies. In some cases, the cut is deep enough to fork the tip of thepenis. Some Australian aborigines considered this symbolic of a serpent deity; in other aborigi-nal groups the subincision was reopened periodically for ritual bleeding.Surgeries that are to a degree analogous to male circumcision are also found in females inmany cultures. There are several forms of what is sometimes known as female circumcision orgenital cutting. The simplest forms are where the prepuce (analogous to the male foreskin) of theclitoris or a part of the clitoris itself is removed. Sometimes the labia minora is removed with theclitoris. These forms are referred to as clitoridectomy. The more extreme forms are termedinfibulation. In Pharaonic infibulation, found in many areas of northeastern Africa, the entireclitoris, labia minora, and labia majora are removed and the remnants of the latter are sewedtogether leaving a small opening for urination and the passing of menstrual blood. This surgeryprevents sexual intercourse and is a requirement for marriage. The wound is reopened by or forsexual intercourse.Female cutting may be done at adolescence as a part of a rite of passage, but it is oftenperformed much earlier. The procedure is seen as protecting the family’s honor and controllingfemale sexuality. Although many individuals who do female genital cutting believe that such an"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94Chapter 4 • Ritualaction is prescribed by the Qur’an, it is actually nowhere in the Qur’an. Actually the practicepredates both Islam and Christianity and is practiced in some Christian communities.Many international organizations, including the United Nations, are working to eliminatethe practice of genital cutting. On one hand this is seen as a public health issues, especiallybecause the surgery is frequently performed under unsanitary conditions by individuals nottrained in proper medical and surgical techniques. The practice is associated with infections,infertility, and even death. On the other hand it is seen as a human rights issue, cast as violenceagainst women and children.Another element in the discussions of genital cutting echoes the discussion of culturalrelativism in Chapter 1. Genital cutting is an essential element in many religious practices,including Islam and Judaism, which practice male circumcision. And there are many who seemale circumcision as genital mutilation. What is to one community as expression of religion andculture may be to another community a violation of basic human rights. The big questions are,where is the line to be drawn and who gets to draw it?PilgrimagesIn Chapter 2 we looked at stories that tell of the creation of the earth and of humankind. Inparticular, we read the story of creation in Genesis and the story of creation as told by theNavaho. One difference between the Judeo-Christian and Navaho stories is that the former takesplace at a location that cannot be located on a modern map or visited by tourists. The Garden ofEden may be a supernatural place or a place whose location has been lost. In either case it is farremoved from the immediate landscape of people who read the narrative.By contrast, the Navaho live in the midst of the landscape of the creation. As they movethrough their world, they point to mountains, streams, and rock formations that are mentioned intheir myths. The landscape is a constant reminder of their mythological past, and they interactwith this past on a daily basis.All religions are associated with sacred places that are mentioned in their religious stories,places associated with important events in the past. The Muslims have the Kaaba in Mecca; theJews have the Temple wall in Jerusalem; Christians have places in Jerusalem that are recountedin the story of Jesus; Buddhists have relics of the Buddha that are housed in particular temples;Hindus have the River Ganges. These are important focal points for religious practice.There are also sacred places where miraculous events have taken place in more recenttimes. In Mexico the story is told of a native who was baptized into the Catholic Church in 1525and became known by his Christian name of Juan Diego. According to legend, in 1531 an imageof the Virgin Mary appeared to Juan Diego and left a likeness of herself on his cloak. The cloakbearing the image resides today in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City (Figure4.3). The basilica has become a major sacred site. People come to this site for many reasons;some are seeking cures for illness. Juan Diego was made a saint of the Catholic Church in 2002.A journey to a sacred place is often referred to as a pilgrimage. A pilgrimage can also bea series of rituals that are associated with a sequence of sacred spaces. In terms of our classifica-tion of rituals, each ritual in the sequence of rituals is a social rite of intensification, althoughtherapy rituals are often included. In fact, the purpose of a pilgrimage may be to seek a supernat-ural cure for an illness.One of the best-known pilgrimage sites in the Christian world is Lourdes, France. FromFebruary through July 1858, Bernadette Soubirous witnessed a total of eighteen apparitions of"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual95FIGURE 4.3Our Lady of Guadalupe.Painting ofOur Lady of Guadalupe on the wall of the Atotonilco Sanctuary in the State of Guanajuato,Mexico.the Virgin Mary at a grotto near the town of Lourdes. Today the grotto is the site of pilgrimagesby Catholics seeking a cure from illness.A pilgrimage often can be seen as a rite of passage. Such a journey may be a requirementof a religion, and a person returning from a pilgrimage may have achieved a new status orposition in the community. The experience of participating in a pilgrimage may include the threephases beginning with separation (traveling from one’s home to the sacred place or to thebeginning of the journey to several sacred places). During the rituals that occur at a sacred site orseries of sites, the pilgrim is in a liminal state that is characteristic of the transition phase. Finally,at the end the individual reenters the everyday world, often with some symbol of havingparticipated in the pilgrimage.Pilgrimages also may involve visiting a number of related sites. One of the best known ofsuch pilgrimages, and certainly one that involves large numbers of participants, is the Islamichajj.This involves a prescribed visit to a series of sacred sites with specific ritual activitiesoccurring at each one. The hajjis described in Box 4.1."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Huichol PilgrimageThe Huichol are a Native American people living in the Sierra Madre Occidental of centralMexico (Mesoamerican culture area). A key element of their religious traditions is the annualjourney of more than 300 miles to Wirikuta, an area located east of their villages. This is a sacredjourney. It reenacts the journey of the Ancient Ones, the Huichol ancestors, that took placeduring the creation of their world.BOX 4.1The HajjOne of the Five Pillars of Islam, which form the framework of Muslim life, is the hajj,or thepilgrimage to Mecca. All Muslims who are able to do so are expected to make the pilgrimage toMecca at least once in their lifetime. The hajjbegins on the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah(month forHajj), the twelfth month of the Islamic year, and lasts for as long as six days. Every year, more thantwo million pilgrims from all over the world go to Mecca during this month. The hajjincludes aseries of rituals and symbols that are intended to bring the pilgrim as close as possible to God.A common act during the hajjis a constant repetition of the Shahadah,or statement of belief.This creed states that “La ilaha ill-Allah Muhammad-un Rasulu-llah” (“There is no God but Allah,and Mohammad is the Messenger of God”).Although there is some variation, what follows is a basic description of the sequence of eventsthat make up the hajj.Before entering Mecca, the pilgrims stop at designated places outside the cityto conduct cleansing rituals. As part of this cleansing, men cut their nails, trim their beards, and puton a white seamless garment. (Women also wear white, but no particular dress is prescribed.) Bywearing this special clothing, all pilgrims become alike, symbolic of the Islamic belief that all Muslimsare equal before God regardless of social status or wealth. This garment is also like a burial shroud,which symbolizes dying or turning away from earthly life to devote all attention to God.The pilgrims then move into the Great Mosque, which can hold up to 500,000 pilgrims ata time. Here the pilgrims walk around the Kaaba seven times. The Kaaba is a black stone thatstands fifteen meters high, engraved with the sacred names of Allah. It was already a sacredobject in Mecca before the time of Mohammad. The Qur’an says that Abraham and Ishmaeltogether built the Kaaba, and it is also thought to be the site of Adam’s original place of worship.The pilgrims then travel to the plain of Mina, three miles from Mecca. According to theQur’an, Mina and other sites such as Arafat are places where the word of God was revealedthrough Mohammad. After going to Mina, the pilgrims move on to the Arafat Valley, whereMuslims believe Mohammad delivered his last sermon. The pilgrims gather stones and return toMina. The stones are thrown at the Jamraat,three pillars that represent places where Satan tried totempt Abraham from following the path of Allah. This act is symbolic of Abraham throwing stonesat Satan when he tried to dissuade Abraham from sacrificing his son. Also related to this event is theritual sacrifice of a sheep. This is seen as a reminder of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his ownson, even though God’s mercy allowed the substitution of a ram. The meat is distributed to family,friends, and the needy. Finally, the pilgrims return to the Great Mosque to again circle the Kaaba.After completion of the rituals the pilgrims reenter normal life. They cut their hair, feast, andmay engage in sexual intercourse. On returning home, they often wear special clothing, are givena special title, and assume important positions within their communities.96Chapter 4 • Ritual"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"During the dry season, between October and February, small groups of pilgrims, each ledby a shaman, leave their villages to travel to Wirikuta. Many objects are collected and preparedfor the journey, including candles, small yarn paintings, coins, and special arrows. Each pilgrimassumes the role of one of the Ancient Ones. This is more than play acting, for they become thegods they represent. The shaman leading the pilgrimage becomes Grandfather Fire.As the Huichol pilgrims journey on foot (or today partly by bus or truck), they visit anumber of sacred sites, such as water holes and caves. At each of these places the story of thejourney of the Ancient Ones and their visit to the sacred place is told. Offerings are made, andprayers are recited, as social rites of intensification are performed.Finally, they reach the sacred land, where they find the peyote cactus, the “footprint of thedeer.” After being ritually “killed” and after offerings have been made, the cactus is collected andeaten. Peyote contains a hallucinogen. The Huichol believe that by eating the peyote, they seewhat the gods see. (The use of hallucinogens in religious rituals is discussed in Chapter 5.)RELIGIOUS OBLIGATIONSThere are a number of simple religious ritual acts that are usually performed by an individual ora small group such as a family. A Christian says grace before eating a meal. A Jew entering abuilding kisses the mezuzah, a small case attached to the door frame in which lies a parchmentwith verses from the Torah. A Buddhist lights a candle in a household shrine.There are other ceremonial obligations that might not involve obvious ritual activity but doentail a series of obligations and avoidances of particular objects, foods, and activities that arefound in daily life. For example, virtually all cultures have certain foods that are served only onceremonial occasions. Other foods may be forbidden to all members of the community or certainmembers of the society at particular points in time.TabuIn a society some objects and people may be off limits and are said to be tabu. The term tabualso refers to inappropriate modes of interpersonal behaviors. These are often phrased in terms ofpollution. It would bring dishonor, bad luck, or some other negative result for a person to havecontact with someone or something that is tabu.Things that are sacred can be thought of as possessing supernatural power and are thereforeoff limits to most individuals. Contact with the supernatural can be dangerous. Priests mustperform rituals to safeguard themselves and the community against this danger. This is not mali-cious power. It is neutral, like electricity. If you stick a wet finger into an electric socket, you willreceive a large jolt of electricity, and perhaps you will die. The electricity is not evil, but it ispowerful. When properly harnessed, it can be used to light our homes, run machinery, and so forth.One of the most sacred objects in the Torah is the ark that carried the stone tablets fromMount Sinai to Jerusalem to be installed in the Temple. The journey of the ark to Jerusalem wasnot a simple one, and many of the episodes that occurred on this journey illustrate how danger-ous the ark was. Not only was the ark a sacred object, but also God had declared that only Aaronand his descendants were allowed to touch it. On one occasion, as the ark approached the thresh-ing floor of Nacon, the oxen that were pulling the cart that carried the ark stumbled. One ofthe followers, Uzzah, reached out to steady the ark. After all, it would have been a sacrilege to letthe ark fall to the ground. Yet we are told that Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, “And theanger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there heChapter 4 • Ritual97"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"98Chapter 4 • Ritualdied by the ark of God” (2 Samuel 6:7). In other words, Uzzah’s death was not the result of someevil activity. In fact his steadying of the ark was a good thing; but his contact with such a holyobject, in the absence of ritual, resulted in his death.The response to breaking a tabu is thought to be automatic rather than being at the decisionof a deity. Sometimes nothing can be done to save the individual who has broken the tabu, butoften there are ritual means of mending the situation.MANA AND TABU IN POLYNESIA.The concept of tabu in Polynesia can be seen in theetiquette surrounding the chief. Again, this relates to the idea of things that possess supernat-ural power being seen as dangerous and often best avoided. In Polynesia this supernaturalpower is described by the term mana. Mana is an impersonal supernatural force that is foundconcentrated in special places in the landscape, in particular objects, and in certain people.In some cases it is possible for an individual to gain or manipulate mana, thus tapping intoa source of supernatural power that then can be used for some purpose. Frequently, mana isgranted to a person by a supernatural being. In Polynesia mana comes from the gods. The chief,as a direct descendant of the gods, has the most mana, followed by his relatives and so on downthrough the hierarchy. Mana does flow from one thing to another, but it is part of the chief’s roleto be a reservoir and conductor of mana.However, because of the chief’s great amount of mana, he constitutes an involuntarymenace to those around him, who have a lesser capacity for mana. Thus many tabus are inplace to protect others from this power. Not only is it tabu to touch the chief himself, butbecause the chief’s mana also runs into everything he uses, it also is dangerous to use hisfurniture or even use his fire to cook with. In some places the chief was even carried around ona litter because if he walked on a path with his own feet, the path became forever dangerous, ortabu, to commoners.Jewish Food LawsMany cultures have complex systems of food prohibitions. These prohibitions may apply to the entirecommunity, or they may apply only to individuals of a particular age, gender, or social position.Kashrutis the Jewish law regarding what foods can and cannot be eaten and how foodsmust be prepared. Kashrutcomes from the Hebrew root Kaf-Shin-Resh,meaning fit, proper, orcorrect. The more commonly known word koshercomes from the same root. Kosher foods arethose that are proper according to the Kashrut.Food that is not kosher is referred to as treyf.Although some have tried to analyze these rules in terms of early health regulations, Jews whoobserve these dietary laws do so because the Torah says to do so. No other reason is necessary.(Rules similar to the Jewish dietary laws are also found in Islam, in which permitted foods arehalaland prohibited foods are haram.)The rules for keeping kosher include eating only land mammals that have cloven hoofs andchew their cud. (“Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, amongthe beasts, that shall ye eat” [Leviticus 11:3].) This is why eating pork is not allowed.Even animals that are allowed to be eaten must be slaughtered ritually. This ritual slaugh-ter is known as shechitahand is performed by a ritual specialist, a shochet.The ritual slaughter isdone by a quick, deep stroke across the animal’s throat with a perfectly sharp blade. This methodis seen as being the most humane method of slaughter possible. It ensures a rapid and completedraining of the blood as well, which is also a kosher rule. The prohibition of the consumptionof blood is the only dietary law that has a reason given in the Torah: The life of the animal is"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 • Ritual99contained in the blood. (“Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl orbeast, in any of your dwellings. Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even thatsoul shall be cut off from his people” [Leviticus 7:26–27].)Many of these obligations serve to provide a social identity to a group and to clearly sepa-rate that community from its neighbors. They also serve to separate different subgroups from oneanother in a multicultural society. For example, members of a particular group might wearspecial clothing that marks them as members of that group, such as a wearing a turban or otherhead covering, or might alter the appearance of their body, such as growing a beard. Particularbehaviors and food prohibitions also serve as symbols of group identity and as barriers to socialinteractions between different social units. If you cannot eat with someone, it becomes difficultto engage in close social interactions. Such prohibitions play important roles in definingreligious groups and keeping them intact.BOX 4.2Menstrual TabusOne common category of tabus found cross-culturally is menstrual tabus. Common rules includespending time in menstrual huts, refraining from cooking or eating certain foods, restricting con-tact with males (especially in regards to sex), and bathing in special locations and/or times. Manyof these tabus separate women from men and are seen as protecting men from possible pollution.The Mehinaku, an Amazonian group, tell the following myth about the origins of menstruation.aA long time ago the Sun (Kama) wanted to have sex with Spirit Woman (Apapainyeineju).Oh, but her labia were long. The Sun took her by the wrist and said, “Let’s have sex!” Towhich she replied, “Ah, not me. My vagina is very dangerous and frightening. Inside thereis stinging ant, Mein. Inside there are snakes, such as Mekhe and others. Inside is Scorpion,Yucapanu. If it gets you, then you will really be sick. There are many of these between mylabia too. I am really dangerous and frightening.”The Sun went into the forest and returned with fish poison and dredged it into SpiritWoman’s vagina, just as he would have done into a pool. Out floated all of the dangerousanimals. Out came the snakes, then the spiders, and the scorpion. All of these came out butone tiny piranha that remained lodged deep inside her.“This is good,” said the Sun, and he gave tiny piranha to all the women. Each monththe piranha bite the women and make them bleed. Sometimes, the woman can feel thepiranha bite, and tell their husbands, “Soon I am going to have my period.”As seen in the myth, for the Mehinaku, female genitalia is seen as a source of danger andpossible injury. This remains true beyond mythic times as menstruating women are seen as conta-minating food which can cause an illness with chest pains and a cough. Although this illness is notserious for women, it is for men and can even cause death.Menstrual tabus are found in the world religions as well. In Judaism, menstrual blood isconsidered ritually unclean. Leviticus 18:19 states, “You shall not approach a woman in her timeof unclean separation, to uncover her nakedness” and women are forbidden from making anyphysical contact with men during menstruation and for the week following. At the end of thistime, the woman immerses herself in a mikvah, a ritual bath."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"100Chapter 4 • RitualRestrictions for Muslim women are for religious functions only and are based on the Qur’an2:22 which states, “They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation. Say it is an illnessso let women alone at such times and go not into them until they are cleansed. And when they havepurified themselves, then go unto them as Allah hath enjoined upon you.” A menstruating womanmay not enter a shrine or mosque, and may not pray, fast, or touch or recite from the Qur’an. Shemust refrain from sex and complete a ritual washing before she is considered clean again.Specific rules about menstruation are not common in Christian denominations, but a history ofmenstrual tabus has been a major factor in discussions about having women in positions of authorityin Christianity and some, such as the Orthodox Church, do not allow menstruating women to receivecommunion.aT. Gregor, Anxious Pleasures: The Sexual Lives of an Amazonian People(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987),p. 142.CONCLUSIONIn the last few chapters we have introduced many basic concepts in the study of religion, such asworldview, narratives, symbols, and rituals. As we progress through the book and discuss newideas and practices, it is important to keep in mind how these different elements are related toone another. We discussed in the last chapter the connection between worldview, symbols, andreligious narratives. In this chapter we added ritual to the mix.We defined a religious ritual as a repetitive, patterned act that involves the manipulation ofreligious symbols. In Chapter 3 we discussed how religious symbols are often based on specificepisodes recounted in religious narratives and that they represent a specific worldview. On anoth-er level we see that rituals are often reenactments of, or directly reference, specific religiousnarratives. In the examples in this chapter we saw that Navaho sand paintings representimportant religious stories, that the Huichol pilgrimage retraces the path of the Ancient Ones astold in religious narratives, and that the Jewish Passover ritual is based on the book of Exodus,just to name a few.Ritual itself is an essential component of religious practice. The ritual expresses importantworldviews through the retelling of sacred narratives and the manipulation of fundamentalsymbols. Participation in a ritual is usually a group event and constitutes an expression not justof the beliefs of the group, but also of group solidarity. In the next chapter, in our discussion ofaltered states of consciousness, we will further discuss the important psychological impact ofrituals. In the words of Anthony Wallace, “Ritual is religion in action; it is the cutting edge of thetool. . . . It is ritual which accomplishes what religion sets out to do.”5SummaryA religious ritual is a standardized, repetitive se-quence of activities that involves the manipulationof religious symbols such as prayers, offerings, andreadings of sacred literature. Rituals are oftenbased on and are sanctioned in myths that articu-late the underlying worldview of a culture, andthese tenets are embedded in the rituals that areperformed by a society.

These include the familiar social riteof intensification that reinforces religious andsocial beliefs and values and the rite of passagethat marks an individual’s movement from onestatus to another. Rites of passage include birth,coming-of-age, marriage, and death rituals aswell as many secular rituals such as graduationsand inaugurations. Three phases can usually beidentified within a rite of passage: separation,transition, and incorporation.In addition to these there are many smallrituals and obligations that are demanded ofadherents of particular religions. This includesthe concept of tabu. Things that are tabu are sepa-rated from the society and are often considered tobe sacred.Suggested ReadingsMark J.

In interacting with the supernatural world, an indi-vidual may have mental experiences that transcend ordinary experiences, such as atrance. Such experiences are called altered states of consciousness.A religious experience is a subjective one that manifests itself on an emotional and psycho-logical level. These emotions range from fear and anxiety to a generalized feeling of well-beingto a profound experience in which a person feels an association with supernatural power or asupernatural entity such as a spirit or a god. These experiences and emotions make up an impor-tant element of religious practice.In its simplest sense, an altered state of consciousness is any mental state that is recog-nized by the individual or observer as differing from a normal state. Daydreaming and thefeeling that comes from drinking a little too much alcohol are examples of mental states thatcan be subjectively identified by the individual, and/or seen by observers, as being differentfrom that individual’s normal, alert mental state. Although everyone experiences alteredstates of consciousness to some degree, in both religious and nonreligious contexts, in manycultures these states are encouraged and are interpreted by the culture as important religiousexperiences.THE NATURE OF ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSThe definition of an altered state of consciousness is a subjective one, including a wide varietyof phenomena. Table 5.1 lists some of the experiences that characterize altered states. Whichparticular mental state is experienced and the intensity of that experience depend on a number offactors, including the nature of the factor responsible for an individual entering an altered state,the context of the experience, the individual’s and society’s expectation, and the physical andmental condition of the individual.5"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"104Chapter 5 • Altered States of ConsciousnessEntering an Altered State of ConsciousnessAltered states of consciousness can be brought about by a number of physiological, psychological,and pharmaceutical factors. Table 5.2 lists a number of situations that can bring about an alteredstate of consciousness. Many of these factors occur in religious practices and are given a religiousinterpretation.FASTING.Fastingis the act of abstaining from eating food and drinking liquids over a periodof time. The concept of fasting may also include other prohibitions such as that against sexualintercourse and smoking. There is great variation in the nature of a fast. In some societies the fastincludes all food and drink; in some the drinking of water is permitted. In still other societies afast refers to abstaining from a particular food such as meat.Fasting leads to an alteration in body chemistry. In response to the absence of food intake overan extended period of time, the body turns to alternative means of providing glucose to run thebody. Initially fat stores in the liver and elsewhere are metabolized. On depletion of the fat stores,the body begins to break down proteins. The feeling of hunger normally disappears after a few days.Changes in body chemistry accelerate with intense, prolonged fasting, and the fasting indi-vidual will show the clinical features of starvation. Severe symptoms of starvation, includingTABLE 5.1Characteristics of Altered States of ConsciousnessAlterations in thinking: disturbances in concentration, attention, memory, and judgment; realitytesting impaired to varying degrees; distinction between cause and effect blurredDisturbed time sense: altered sense of time and chronology; feelings of timelessness; time comingto a standstill; the acceleration or slowing of time seen as infinitely long or infinitesimally shortLoss of control: fear of losing grip on reality and self-control; feelings of helplessness; in spiritpossession states the person relinquishes controlChange in emotional expression: sudden and unexpected displays of emotional extremes;individual may become detached and uninvolvedBody image change: distortion in body image; a schism between body and mind; dissolution ofboundaries between self and others and the universe; various parts of the body appear or feelshrunken, enlarged, distorted, heavy, weightless, disconnected; spontaneous experiences ofdizziness, blurring of visionPerceptual distortions: hallucinations; increased visual imagery; synesthesia, in which one form ofsensory experience is translated into other form, such as in seeing or feeling soundChange in meaning or significance: attach increased meaning or significance to experiences;feelings of profunditySense of the ineffable: inability to communicate the experience to someone who has not undergonea similar experience; varying degrees of amnesia; sometimes a lucid memoryFeelings of rejuvenation: experience a new sense of hope, rejuvenation, and rebirth;hypersuggestibility, in which the person comes to rely more on the suggestions of the shaman,demagogue, interrogator, or other religious practitioner; contradictions, doubts, inconsistencies,and inhibitions tend to diminish; suggestions of the person endowed with authority accepted asconcrete realityBased on A.

Because most reli-gious fasts last only a day or two, or involve some intake of food during the fasting period, thefeatures of starvation seldom develop. In intense fasting, the psychological features that areseen include an increase in impulsive and aggressive behavior, and a decrease in competence, aswell as hallucinations. Characteristics associated with dehydration include fatigue, lethargy,confusion, and dizziness. Thus fasting can lead to the development of an altered state.People express many reactions to fasting in a religious context. Of course, in addition tophysiological and psychological features, the cultural expectations play a major role. Fasting isoften seen as a sacrifice to a deity and often accompanies religious rituals. It can be an importantelement in the training of religious specialists in which it is seen as a form of discipline. Fastingalso accompanies rituals of atonement as an act of cleansing.There are many instances of fasting in both the Old and New Testaments. For example,Moses fasted for forty days and forty nights while he was on the mountain with God. Jesus alsofasted for forty days and forty nights while in the wilderness.The Jewish calendar contains a number of fast days. The best known is Yom Kippur, theDay of Atonement and the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. On that day, Jews fast from sunsetto sunset the next day. Fasting includes abstinence from all food and drink, including water, aswell as other prohibitions such as that against sexual intercourse and bathing. Fasting is a part ofthe process of achieving atonement.Fasting is found in some Christian denominations and absent in others. Fasting accompa-nies Holy Communion in the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Here fasting often means abstain-ing from certain, but not all, foods. Fasting customs vary greatly in Protestant churches and oftenaccompany a personal spiritual experience rather than being a part of a ritual. Fasting is found insome Buddhist sects, and it is an important element of Hindu ritual."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Fasting during the month of Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, is one ofthe Pillars of Islam. Fasting includes abstention from food and water from sunup to sundown, aswell as abstention from sex and smoking. This act is seen as moving the individual closer to Godby abandoning those things that are enjoyable. As the community fasts together, people arebrought together with a heightened sense of community.SACRED PAIN.Altered states of consciousness can also result from pain. Pain is a commontheme in religious traditions. It may be a punishment, as in the Christian legacy of Eve bringingforth children in pain (“in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children” [Genesis 3:16]) or the Hinduconsequences of bad karma. Pain may be seen as purifying, as with the ascetics and monks whocause themselves pain of the flesh in this life to avoid greater torment of the soul in the next life.It is sometimes an enemy or maybe even a weapon, as with Christ’s battle on the cross. Finally,pain may be seen as transformative or as a source of supernatural power—pain purifies and isused to achieve exorcism.In our society we tend to think of pain as a very individualistic and even isolating experi-ence. However, religious pain is often shared pain. Sometimes this sharing is vicarious.Christianity provides many examples of the importance of vicarious suffering, including the sacri-fice of Christ on the cross, the existence of hell, and the public executions of witches and heretics.Some individuals have experienced localized pain in areas of the body that correspond to thecrucifixion wounds of Jesus. Sometimes these are seen as marks on the body known as stigmata.Many rituals use pain that is either self-inflicted or inflicted by others. For example, somefuneral rituals involve self-mutilation on the part of mourners (Chapter 8). Self-inflicted pain isalso effective because before performing the act, people often become very focused, concentrat-ing on the act. They may also have undergone a period of purification before the act that mightinclude fasting or lack of sleep.Among the ancient Maya, male rulers would use small obsidian blades to perforate theforeskin of their penises, and women would perforate their tongues and draw strings, oftenstudded with thorns, through their tongues (Figure 5.1). The blood would fall onto strips of bark-paper lying in a ceremonial bowl. The blood-soaked paper then would be burned as an offering.The intense pain and blood loss would bring about visions that were interpreted as the entranceof gods and ancestors into the presence of the ruler.In Chapter 4 we examined rites of passage that included coming-of-age rituals. Theserituals often include tattooing, scarring, and circumcision. Because many of these operations arequite painful, the ability to withstand pain has become an important element in these rituals. Thesubject often enters an altered state of consciousness in the course of undergoing such painfulprocedures. This altered state of consciousness often makes it possible to withstand the pain thatis being inflicted.Certain levels of pain have an analgesic quality (such as when the dentist shakes your lipbefore giving you a Novocain shot or when you rub the elbow you just banged on somethinghard). Pain can also induce a euphoric state, through the body’s production of natural opiates,and may be related to experiences of dissociation or trance. The voluntary ordeals to whichshamanic initiates and ascetics submit themselves may be related to this effect. This is also thegoal of many participants in modern Western body modification subcultures who practice suchthings as hook hangings.Pain is also closely linked to emotion and sense of self. In modern Western medical practice,pain is often seen as being very disruptive and devastating to a person’s life and sense of self, isolatingthe individual in his or her own private world. However, pain can also be experienced as healing and106Chapter 5 • Altered States of Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"FIGURE 5.1Mayan Carving.Stone carvings from Temple 23, Yaxchilán, Mexico, commemorating aritual performed on October 28, 709 C.E., celebrating the birth of Bird-Jaguar.

Instead of being isolating, the pain experience may reinforce the person’s connections toboth the social and supernatural worlds. Prime examples of changes in identity that occur throughpain experiences are possession and exorcism, both of which will be discussed in later chapters.A pilgrimage (see Chapter 4) often involves sacred pain that may be interpreted as a sac-rifice, an imitation of the suffering of a god, a penance, a test, and so on. Again, such pain isrelated to an altered state of consciousness. One example comes from the pilgrimage to SabariMalai in South India. The pilgrimage follows the path of the god Lord Ayyappan, son of Shiva,and his encounter with, and defeat of, a female demon. Pilgrims commit themselves to celibacy,moderate eating, walking with bare feet, and sleeping on the ground. The pilgrimage is a forty-mile journey, walked barefoot over sharp stones and hot sand. The pain of this is seen as anessential part of the pilgrimage, the goal of which is becoming one with Ayyappan. Followingis a description by E. Valentine Daniel of the experience of pain on this pilgrimage:1One tells oneself, “I shall walk on this side or that” or “Look! There’s a patch of grass.Let me go walk on that. It will make my feet feel good, even though the patch is onlythree feet long.” During this phase, one is able to differentiate between the paincaused by the blisters under one’s toenails and those on one’s heels. Then again, oneChapter 5 • Altered States of Consciousness107"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"108Chapter 5 • Altered States of Consciousnessis able to distinguish between the pain caused by blisters, wherever they happen to be,and the pain arising from strained calf muscles and tendons....The headaches causedby the heat of the noon sun and the load of the iru mutican be distinguished from thepain resulting from the straps of the knapsack biting into one’s shoulders.Sooner or later, however, all the different kinds of pain begin to merge....Theexperience of pain makes one acutely aware of oneself (ego) as the victim, and the outside(undifferentiated as roots, stones, and hot sand) as the pain-causing agent....With time,pain stops having a causative agent, and ego is obscured or snuffed out because it hasnothing to contrast itself with or stand against....There is a “feeling” of pain, of course,but it is a sensation that has no agent, no tense, and no comparative....Pain is the onlysensation belonging to the eternal present.The Biological Basis of Altered States of ConsciousnessParticipants in religious rituals may report being possessed by a spirit or visited by an angel; theymay feel their souls move outside their bodies; they may become one with the universe. Theseare real and profound experiences. But what is occurring within the brain of these individuals? Isthere a biological basis for these altered states of consciousness?Neurologist Oliver Sacks and others have looked at the relationship between migraines andreligious experiences.2The term migraineis generally used to describe a type of headache, butmigraines are also associated with nausea and other symptoms that can incapacitate the individ-ual. One symptom associated with migraines is an aura, a type of hallucination. Although aurasare most often visual, they may also involve distortions of other senses.Culture plays a major role in how the patient interprets an aura. A modern migraine suffer-er might experience a visual aura as pathological, a condition that makes it difficult to function—for example, to drive a car. (An aura that consists of floating lights, for example, can severelyinterfere with normal vision.) The same visual experience could be interpreted as a vision. Infact, descriptions of visions were written down and illustrated by Hildegard of Bingen, a nun andmystic who lived from 1098 to 1179. Her descriptions and drawings match contemporarydescriptions of auras by migraine patients. Thus a particular experience may be experienced as amedical condition or, if the culture interprets it that way, a mystical experience.Of course, migraine auras are not consciously induced, as many religious altered states are.Research in neurobiology has focused on how rhythmic, ritualized behavior affects certain partsof the brain. For example, in situations in which a fast rhythm is being used, such as with vigor-ous singing and dancing, the sympathetic systemor arousal system of the brain is driven tohigher and higher levels, ultimately becoming overstimulated. When this happens, the brainessentially selectively shuts down, and certain areas of the brain stop receiving the neural inputthat they normally receive and on which they depend to function normally.One area of the brain that shuts down when overstimulated is a structure in the brain knownas the orientation association structure. This is the part of the brain that enables us to sense theboundaries of our body, to distinguish ourselves from the world around us, and to orient ourselvesin space. These are tasks that we normally take for granted because our brains are functioningwell, but the inability to perform these tasks can cause huge difficulties for people who havesustained damage to this part of the brain. Imagine trying to sit down in a chair if you could not tellwhere you ended and the chair began or if you did not know exactly where your body was.The orientation association structure becomes deprived of new information because of theselective shutdown response to overstimulation of the arousal system. The result of this is a"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 • Altered States of Consciousness109softening of the boundaries between self and other. This may be responsible for an altered mental state described by many religious systems in which the divisions between the self and theoutside world disappear and one feels as being “one” with the universe or supernatural beings.This is referred to as a unitary state.BOX 5.1Altered States in Upper Paleolithic ArtThe Upper Paleolithic of Europe (35,000–10,000 years ago) is the time when the first Homosapiensarrived and replaced the Neandertals. It was a time of new technologies and the develop-ment of artistic traditions. Perhaps the most famous art from this era is that of cave paintings,which are found primarily in France and Spain.Over the decades, archaeologists and art historians have wrestled with interpreting the mean-ing of cave art and the role it played for people of the Upper Paleolithic. David Lewis-Williams believesthat the art was part of a religious experience and are graphic representations of experiences of alteredstates of consciousness, either created while in or immediately after coming out of an altered state.Lewis-Williams points out that when people enter altered states there are some experiencesthat appear to be universal, because they result from the biology of the brain. One is the sensation offlying. Another is that of being drawn into a vortex, which is often perceived as the entrance to a tun-nel that leads to another world such as an underworld. He theorizes that Upper Paleolithic peoplessaw the caves in terms of such experiences. They were the “entrails of the underworld.” The walls ofthe caves were seen as a membrane between the everyday world and the world of the spirits.Many of the works found on the cave walls incorporate some feature of the wall itself, suchas a crack or nodule. Often the painted animals appear to be coming out of the wall. These arespirit-animals, and shamans performed rituals to move these animals through the membrane sothe shaman could use the spirit-animal in healing and other activities. This connection to the spir-it world on the other side of the membrane can be seen in offerings—such as stone objects andanimal teeth—that are wedged into cracks in the wall, thereby sending them into the underworld.Incised lines may also be attempts to penetrate to the other side.In addition to representational images, such as animals, Upper Paleolithic humans paintedgeometric figures on the cave walls. In moving into a trance state, a person passes through threestages. In the first stage, geometric visual images are seen. These are entoptic phenomenaandare the forms painted on the cave walls. These images are seen by peoples in all societies, but theyare open to cultural interpretation. In the second phase, the individual attempts to make sense ofthese phenomena and interprets them in cultural terms. These entoptic images are still seen in thethird stage, or deep trance. They combine with iconic images of people and animals that are seenas part of the spirit world. In these deep trances, an individual will often feel changed into an animal and shares the power of the spirit-animal. Images of transformed shamans are calledtherianthropes.Sources:D. J.

What is important to note is that these studies have found that it is not possibleto get the exact same effects as are seen with ritual behavior just by chemically stimulating theright area. It is only with the merging of beliefs and behaviors that the full effect is achieved.Drug-Induced Altered StatesDrugs can also be used to attain an altered state of consciousness. In Chapter 4 we discussed the pil-grimage of the Huichol of Mexico. The use of peyote is a key element in their religious practices; itis used to contact and interact with supernatural powers in rituals that are an integral part of theirpilgrimage. Although peyote is a controlled substance and its possession is illegal in the UnitedStates, it is legally used by the Native American Church (Box 5.2) as a sacrament in much the sameway as Christians and Jews were able to use sacramental wine during the period of Prohibition. Inall of these cases the substance is used to create a religious experience as it is defined by the culture.Table 5.3 lists various categories of drugs that produce an altered state of consciousness.The use of drugs to induce an altered state of consciousness is practiced by many societies.As with any altered state of consciousness, this can have both adaptive and maladaptive expres-sions. For example, a drug addict may be unable to maintain a home, a job, or normal socialrelationships as a consequence of his or her addiction. In discussing drug-induced altered states,it is important to recognize the difference between secular drug use, which is often extremelymaladaptive, used for escapism, and leads to many personal and social problems, and ritual druguse, which is highly controlled and generally adaptive.THE IMPORTANCE OF A RITUAL SETTING.The problems associated with recreational druguse, such as addiction, are generally not seen when the usage is done in a religious context.Religious drug use takes place only at certain times and in certain contexts, with defined begin-ning and end points. The ritual setting channels the experience in important ways."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 • Altered States of Consciousness111The importance of this structure and the possible dangers of drug use are often recognizedin the insider’s perspective as well. For example, the Huichol emphasize the role of the shamannot just to lead them on the peyote pilgrimage, but also to lead them back. They long for theecstasy of this religious experience but also worry they might not be able to return from it.Members of the Native American Church, who use peyote as a sacrament, also caution againstusing peyote in anything but a religious context.ETHNOGRAPHIC EXAMPLES OF ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSAltered states of consciousness are at the core of many religious experiences and enable thebeliever to experience the supernatural in a very immediate, visceral way. In the followingsection we will see the role of altered states of consciousness in ritual by examining specificethnographic examples.BOX 5.2The Native American ChurchThe late nineteenth century was a difficult time for the Native American population of the UnitedStates. The tribes were losing land, their traditional lifestyles were disappearing, disease haddecimated many native communities, and the official policy of the U.S. government was todestroy Native American culture and to assimilate the populations into the general culture.Religion became one method of coping with this stress, and out of the chaos developed a seriesof religious movements known by anthropologists as nativistic movements. (These movementswill be discussed in detail in Chapter 11.) Many of these movements combined both native andChristian elements, an example of syncretism.Some of these early movements involved the use of the hallucinogenic cactus peyote.Peyote grows in northern Mexico and southern Texas and has a long history of use in religiousritual, as among the Huichol. The ritual use of peyote slowly moved into the Native Americanpopulations and is referred to as peyotism.Some of these groups stress Native American beliefsand rituals; others combine Native American elements with those of Christianity that were introduced by missionaries. They also tend to be pan-Indianin that they incorporateelements and draw membership from many different tribes. Familiar elements of ritual includemeditation, revelation, prayer, and the use of native plant materials—for example, tobaccoand sage.For some groups that utilize Christian elements, peyote plays a role similar to that of thesacramental bread and wine of the Christian Mass. The peyote is believed to contain the power ofGod and to ingest the peyote is to absorb God’s power. Members of the Native American Churchsay that this enables them to have a direct experience of the supernatural.The first Native American Church was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1918, followed byothers. The reactions of the various states to the use of peyote have been mixed. In somesituations it was tolerated; in others individuals were tried and convicted for using a bannedsubstance. Finally, in 1978, Congress amended the American Indian Religious Freedom Act tolegalize the use of peyote as a sacrament in Native American Church rituals."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"112Chapter 5 • Altered States of ConsciousnessThe Holiness ChurchesThe Holiness Churches are a series of independent churches that are found primarily inAppalachia, most predominantly in West Virginia. This area of the United States was oncehighly dependent on coal mining. It was a relatively isolated, economically depressed area.Although some of this is true today, the isolation is breaking down, and life is improving. ManyHoliness Churches still survive. Each church is independent, yet individuals will frequentlyvisit several churches in the region. The rituals do not follow a set pattern, although manyelements are highly traditional, and the sequence of activities is determined largely by theelders of the church community.During the service, several members of the congregation enter an altered state ofconsciousness. The state is entered through intense concentration in prayer and with loudmusic with a repetitive beat; no drugs are used. Individuals speak in tongues, dance energeti-cally, and even enter trancelike states. In some Holiness Churches participants in an alteredstate will pick up poisonous snakes and drink poison. Entrance into an altered state is a highlydesired religious experience and is interpreted as being filled by the Holy Ghost. This is anexample of a unitary state. These practices are based on a specific portion of the Bible:And he [Jesus] said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel toevery creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he thatbelieveth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe; Inmy name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shalltake up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; theyshall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. (Mark 16: 15–18)San Healing RitualsThe !Kung are a subgroup of the San, a hunting and gathering people of the Kalahari Desert insouthern Africa (Khoisan culture area).3In their healing rituals the !Kung experience !kia,which is an altered state of consciousness. According to the !Kung, an energy known asn/um, given to the !Kung by the gods, resides at the base of the spine. As an individual enters!kia, the n/umbegins to boil and turn to a vapor, which then rises in the spine to a point nearthe base of the skull. At that point the individual enters an altered state.In a large !Kung camp, during the time of year when food is plentiful, dances are heldseveral times a month. As night falls, several women sit down around a large fire andbegin to sing. Other women soon join them in a tight circle around the fire and the singingbecomes louder and more energetic. Soon some of the men, and a few women, begin todance around the circle of singers. As the dancing becomes more and more energetic theybecome warm and begin sweating profusely. The dancers then start to stagger and shakeviolently. Having entered !kiathey begin their healing by going around the fire and layingtheir hands on each individual. The !Kung believe that illness is shot into people by theancestors. By laying hands on a person, they pull out the sickness and throw it into thedarkness (Figure 5.2).About half of the men and about 10 percent of the women become healers. In addition topulling out illness, a person in an altered state of consciousness can see the inside of a personand travel to the home of the gods. They experience intense emotions and a sense of ascendingand flying which is interpreted as traveling into the heavens."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 • Altered States of Consciousness113FIGURE 5.2San Healing Ceremony.Healing ritual of the /Gwi band, a subgroup of the San,southern Africa. The men begin to dance around the women, who are singing around a fire.The Sun Dance of the CheyenneThe Sun Dance is a major communal religious ritual practiced by many tribal groups in the NorthAmerican Plains culture area, including the Arapaho, Blackfeet, Crow, Kiowa, Sioux, andCheyenne. Each group has its own particular variations, but there are certain elements commonacross the different cultures. The Sun Dance takes place near the summer solstice and representsthe theme of renewal.The Cheyenne’s name for the Sun Dance, oxheheom, means “New Life Lodge” or “Lodgeof the Generator.” The ritual is closely tied to the creation of the earth and passages from theCheyenne origin story. One myth tells of a famine that was afflicting the Cheyenne. In response,a culture hero named Tomsivsi (Erect Horns) took the beautiful wife of a tribal chief with him ona journey to the Sacred Mountain. Inside the mountain, they were taught the Sun Dance and weretold that by performing the dance the world would be renewed.The ceremony is pledged by an individual who is making a commitment to supernaturalbeings. This pledge may be made in hopes of healing a loved one, or a man may himselfmay be sick and vow to do the dance if he recovers. The vow may be made to avert danger inwar or may be based on a dream. From the time the man makes his pledge until the end ofthe ritual, there is a tabu on sexual activity. This again references the myth in whichTomsivsi refused to have sex with his companion until after he emerged from the SacredMountain."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"114Chapter 5 • Altered States of ConsciousnessThe Sun Dance takes eight days to perform, with the first four days spent building thedance lodge. The center pole for the dance lodge is cut down by a man who interacts with thetree as a warrior interacts with an enemy and it is ritually transported to the lodge by chiefs.Many ritual acts and offerings to the pole are associated with the raising of the pole. Duringthis time, secret rites are also conducted in the Lone Tipi which symbolizes the SacredMountain where Tomsivsi learned the dance. Many acts symbolic of earth renewal are done atthis time.The last four days are devoted to the actual public dance, which takes place in the SunDance Lodge. The participants in the dance face the center pole and rise up and down on theirtoes while standing in one place. As they rise they blow on eagle-wing bone whistles. Thedancers do this almost continuously for the entire four-day period. While there may be brief restperiods, the dancers are completely without food or water.The most dramatic part of the Cheyenne Sun Dance, and an element not practiced by mostother Plains groups, is an act of self-sacrifice known as “hanging from the central pole.” A mandoes this act with the help of a shaman who himself has made the same sacrifice in the past. Theshaman fastens a rope to the central pole that will reach just to the chest of the man. Two holesare cut in the skin of the man’s chest, skewers are passed through, and the free ends of the ropeare attached to the skewers. The man dances, fastened to the pole, all night trying to break free.If he has not done so by morning, the shaman cuts him free.Dancers who make this additional sacrifice do so in hopes of gaining pity from thesupernatural beings and being rewarded with good fortune. Dancers are also rewardedwith public approval and social prestige. The fasting, dancing, and pain all help induce analtered state of consciousness for the dancers. Participants often report having visions duringthe ritual.RELIGIOUS USE OF DRUGS IN SOUTH AMERICAThe use of drugs is ubiquitous in South American traditional societies. For example, anthropolo-gist Napoleon Chagnon describes his first meeting with the Yanomamö of Venezuela:4The entrance to the village was covered over with brush and dry palm leaves. Wepushed them aside to expose the low opening to the village. The excitement of meet-ing my first Yanomamö was almost unbearable as I duck-waddled through the lowpassage into the village clearing.I looked up and gasped when I saw a dozen burly, naked, sweaty, hideous menstaring at us down the shafts of their drawn arrows! Immense wads of green tobaccowere stuck between their lower teeth and lips making them look even more hideous,and strands of dark-green slime dripped or hung from their nostrils—strands so longthat they clung to their pectoral muscles or drizzled down their chin. We arrived atthe village while the men were blowing a hallucinogenic drug up their noses. One ofthe side effects of the drug is a runny nose. The mucus is always saturated with thegreen powder and they usually let it run freely from their nostrils.After Chagnon spent some time with the Yanomamö and was able to look deeper into theirculture, he began to understand the role of these practices in their religious system. TheYanomamö world is populated by tiny, humanlike spirits called hekura.One’s supernaturalpower depends on one’s ability to entice the hekurainto the chest, which is visualized as a world"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 • Altered States of Consciousness115of rivers, mountains, and forests. To accomplish this, one must take ebene,which is a hallucino-genic snuff made of several ingredients. The snuff is blown into the nose of the individual.Many ethnographies of South American cultures describe the varied ways in which drugsare used among these peoples. Many of these practices are outlined by Johannes Wilbert,who, while focusing on the use of tobacco in South American societies, also touches on the useof other substances. In these societies a drug is often used in combination with a variety ofsubstances, both collected and cultivated.5The use of tobacco, often mixed with other substances, is common in South Americansocieties. The substances are made into several different forms, and many delivery systems havedeveloped. Of course, traditional societies do not have the option of injection, so the problem ishow to get the drug into the bloodstream, where it will move rapidly to the brain.Substances are efficiently absorbed in parts of the body that are lined with epithelial tissuethat contain a high density of blood capillaries. These include the lining of lungs, mouth, throat,digestive system, rectum, nose, and eyes. Tobacco can be smoked, sucked (as in chewingtobacco), or drunk. Some tribes produce a processed form of tobacco with the consistency of ajelly, which is then rubbed on the teeth and gums. Tobacco can be dried and ground into apowder and blown up the nose.Drugs also can be introduced into the rectum by some type of enema device. The advan-tages of this technique are that it will not irritate the stomach and that the drug will not be lost ifthe individual vomits. Sometimes the enema device is a simple tube. The drug is then blown intothe rectum. Another device makes use of a bulb that can be made from rubber or the bladder ofan animal. A painting on a pottery vessel found in a Mayan site solved the mystery of a particu-lar type of pottery vessel that appeared to have no obvious function. The painting shows it beingused, with a rubber bulb, as an enema syringe.RastafariansRastafarians are members of an Afro-Caribbean religion that has its roots in Christianity butvenerates the former emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, as the messiah. Rastafarians believe thatpeople of African descent are the Israelites reincarnated and generally focus on issues of racerelations. One of their key beliefs is in the coming repatriation of blacks in the Americas to Africa.The Rastafarians are an example of a revitalization movement (Chapter 11), originating inconditions of social and economic deprivation and meant to improve the lives of its adherentsthrough adopting new religious beliefs. Since its beginnings the Rastafarian movement has grownto encompass not just the poor, but also the middle classes and has spread out from its place oforigin, Jamaica, partly through the international spread of both Jamaican people and reggae music.The Rastafarians stress a philosophy of ital levity, which stresses the rejection of Westernconsumerism and emphasizes living in harmony with nature. This includes eating food that isgrown without chemical fertilizers and using herbal remedies. In addition to vegetarianism andnot cutting the hair (resulting in dreadlocks), a common Rastafarian religious practice isthe smoking of marijuana, or ganga. Gangais sometimes referred to as the “wisdom weed” or“the holy herb” and is seen as a religious sacrament and a way to gain new understandings ofself, the universe, and God.Rastafarians trace the use of gangato several passages in the Bible, including thefollowing: “thou shalt eat the herb of the field” (Genesis 3:18), “eat every herb of the land”(Exodus 10:12), and “Better is a dinner of herb where love is, than a stalled ox and hatredtherewith” (Proverbs 15:17)."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"116Chapter 5 • Altered States of ConsciousnessCONCLUSIONIn Chapter 1 we listed the six dimensions of religion as set forth by Ninian Smart. One of thesewas the experiential dimension, an encounter with a sacred reality that is beyond ordinaryexperience. Religious experiences can be highly emotional. They can range from a generalizedfeeling of well-being to dramatic visions. These mental states, states that differ from one’snormal mental states, are altered states of consciousness. They define religious experience. It isthrough such altered states that supernatural phenomena and powers manifest themselves. Itmoves abstract beliefs into the realm of lived experience.Interpreting the changes in mental state when one is in an altered state of consciousnessis largely influenced by culture. In other words, culture places meaning on our experiences. A buzz from drinking several alcoholic drinks is amenable to several interpretations. Some aresecular: “I’ve had a little too much to drink, and I’m feeling tipsy.” Some people, experiencingthe identical reaction, might interpret that same feeling as “I feel as if a spirit has entered mybody.” The objective feeling may be the same, but the subjective interpretation may be verydifferent.The religious interpretations of altered states of consciousness generally fall into twocategories. First, supernatural power, usually in the form of spirits or gods, enters the person’sbody, a phenomenon that we call spirit possession. An individual can control the spirit withinhis or her body to accomplish certain goals, or the spirit that possesses a human body can use thatbody to heal or to divine the unknown, often without the knowledge or the memory of thepossessed person. However, possession by an unwanted spirit can bring about illness that may becured by exorcism rituals.The second common religious interpretation of an altered state of consciousness is that aperson has entered a trance state because the soul has left the person’s body. The experience ofthe individual in the altered state is then associated with the experiences of the soul, which isoperating in a supernatural realm.Altered states frequently play an important role in healing, for both the healer and thepatient. Healing is facilitated, and in some cases even accomplished, through suggestibility,emotional catharsis, and feelings of rejuvenation. For example, when possessed by aspirit, the healer may use the supernatural power of the spirit to remove the cause of theillness, often by sucking the offending spirit out of the patient’s body. When an illness isdiagnosed as the loss of the soul, the healer sends his or her soul on a voyage to retrieve thelost soul of the patient.The most common idea of religious altered states, though, is the idea of achieving a unitarystate, a state in which the individual experiences a feeling of becoming one with the supernatural,however this is conceived of by the community. For some, this is becoming one with God or aspirit; for others, it may be expressed as becoming one with a generalized supernatural force. Wesaw an example of this in our discussion of the Sabari Malai pilgrimage, the goal of which is aunitary state with the god Lord Ayyappan.The idea of the unitary state is often one of the major components of a religious ritual oreven an entire religious system. A common religious theme is that humans were once at one withthe supernatural but somehow became separated. The goal of many religious practices is toregain that unity. This theme can be seen in many familiar religions. For Christians, Jesusprovides the pathway back to God; for Buddhists, following the teachings of Buddha allows anindividual to attain oneness with the universe; for Muslims, reconciliation is possible throughsubmission of the will to Allah."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 • Altered States of Consciousness117SummaryAn altered state of consciousness is any mentalstate that differs from a normal mental state. Suchstates are characterized by a number of psycho-logical experiences, such as alterations in patternsof thinking, disturbed sense of time, change inemotional expression, distortion in body image,and others. A person can enter an altered statethrough a number of situations including reduc-tion of external stimulation, increase of externalstimulation, increased alertness or decreasedalertness, pain, or alterations in body chemistrysuch as those that accompany fasting and sleepdeprivation. These factors create observablechanges in the activity of the brain.Altered states of consciousness can also bebrought about by drugs and chemical agents, suchas the use of tobacco, coffee, alcohol, marijuana,peyote, and a number of manufactured substances.However, the use of these substances in religiouspractice occurs within a religious context. Theexperience is strongly influenced by culturalexpectations.Suggested ReadingsAriel Glucklich, Sacred Pain: Hurting the Body for theSake of the Soul(Oxford, England: OxfordUniversity Press, 2001).[Examines ideas about and uses of pain in reli-gious contexts.]Richard Katz, Boiling Energy: Community HealingAmong the Kalahari Kung(Cambridge, MA:Harvard University Press, 1982).Autobiographies about Personal Religious ExperiencesKaren Armstrong, Through the Narrow Gate(NewYork: St. Martin’s Press, 1995).[Armstrong, who has written on many religioustopics, tells of her own spiritual life, includingseven years in a convent.]Madeleine L’Engle, The Irrational Season: TheCrosswicks Journal, Book 3(San Francisco:Harper & Row, 1984).[L’Engle’s journal follows a church year and herown questioning of her faith.]C.

However, it is only with a discussion of altered states of consciousness that a trueappreciation of the power of rituals can be reached. Narratives provide a basis for belief, but it isonly with ritual that these ideas are turned into experiences. A religious altered state in a wayoffers visceral proof of the existence of the supernatural. These experiences move the supernat-ural from the realm of abstract belief into that of a lived reality.Suggested Websiteshttp://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nms/Snakes.htmlInformation and links on serpent handlers.www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/hildegarde.htmlThe life and works of Hildegard von Bingen.www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/archat/chauvet/en"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"118Chapter 5 • Altered States of ConsciousnessStudy Questions1.Altered states of consciousness include familiarexperiences such as dreaming and daydreaming.Describe any such experiences that you have had.How do they fit the description of an altered stateof consciousness that is given in this chapter?2.Many factors can lead to altered states of cons-ciousness and are likely to occur in most people’slives.

However, some individuals may develop a specialinterest in religious practices and may develop a special ability to contact the supernatural. Anexample is the healers found among the Ju/’hoansi San, in which around half of the men and a num-ber of women become healers. Yet these men and women are full participants in the secular life ofthe group. Full-time, specialized religious statuses usually do not exist in such societies, becausethese societies do not produce the surplus of food that is necessary to support full-time specialists.As we discussed earlier, religious activities are not clearly delineated from nonreligiousactivities in small-scale societies. Religious activities are interwoven with secular activities;indeed, the separation between religious and secular is not even made. This is reflected in thelack of full-time religious specialists.Some societies have developed part-time specialists. These are people who earn theirliving at some economic task, such as hunting or farming, but who are called on to performrituals when necessary because of their special knowledge or abilities. Such a person might bepaid for his or her services, but many are not.In larger and more technologically complex societies we see the development of manyoccupational specializations, including religious specialists. These practitioners may be full-timespecialists who derive their income primarily from the performance of religious rituals. Suchindividuals may be supported by the community, or they may derive their income throughpayment for services by individuals whom they have helped. For example, religious practitionersmay be found in a marketplace, ready to be approached by clients who are in need of services inorder to secure economic success for some endeavor or perhaps a cure for an illness. In somesocieties religious practitioners may attain important political and economic positions.There are many terms used to describe religious specialists. Unfortunately, the terms arenot used in a consistent manner. Sometimes it is a problem of translation because the natureof religious practitioners and their activities in many societies might not neatly fit a definedcategory in our society or as defined by anthropologists.Two major categories used to categorize religious specialists are those of shaman andpriest. These are not two mutually exclusive categories, but rather ends of a continuum. Veryoften a religious practitioner that we might classify as a priest will perform some functions thatare more characteristic of a shaman; the reverse is also true.6"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"120Chapter 6 • Religious SpecialistsSHAMANSThe distinction between priests and shamansis not always clear-cut, and there are many religiousspecialists who fall somewhere in between. Generally speaking, in contrast to a priest, a shamanreceives his or her power directly from the spirit world. He or she acquires status and abilities,such as healing, through personal communication with the supernatural during shamanic trancesor altered states of consciousness. The route to becoming a religious specialist and how eachfunctions within a society will also differ for shamans and priests.Defining ShamanismLike many terms used in the study of religion, the term shamanhas been used in different waysby different people. Some use the term very broadly to encompass a wide variety of phenomena;others use it in only a very narrow sense. Most agree that shamanism refers to techniques used byspecific kinds of religious specialists and that shamans can be found in a wide variety of culturesand religions (Figure 6.1).The term shamanactually comes from the Tungus language of Central Siberia. It refers tothe religious specialists who use handheld drums and spirit helpers to help the members of theircommunity by healing the sick, divining the future, and ensuring success in the hunt. The termwas later expanded to include similar religious specialists in other cultures, although some peoplebelieve that the term shamanshould only be applied to these Siberian religious specialists.For those who apply the term more broadly, the crucial elements of shamanism includedirect contact and communication with the supernatural through trance, the use of spirit helpers,FIGURE 6.1Borneo Shaman.A shaman in Borneo curing a young female client."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 • Religious Specialists121the use of a specific culturally recognized and transmitted method and paraphernalia, and asocially recognized special position for the shaman.Unlike priests, who are full-time community-based specialists, shamans are usually part-time independent contractors. The authority of a shaman lies in his or her charisma andability to heal. The relationship between a shaman and the community is a personal one.Shamans focus on specific problems, such as problems that affect a particular individual orfamily. Because clients often select a shaman in a particular situation for the shaman’s reputationand track record in curing, successful shamans can amass a significant degree of social authority.BECOMING A SHAMAN.Because shamans receive their power and authority directly from asupernatural entity, shamans frequently are chosen by spirits to become a shaman. Perhaps thebehavior of a child with regard to sacred objects is interpreted as a sign of selection by the spirits for training as a shaman. Often the call comes in a dream or trance. In some societies aperson may deliberately seek a call through inducing an altered state of consciousness. This ismost frequent in societies in which shamans achieve some degree of social authority. Morecommonly, the task of being a shaman is so difficult and demanding, and the shaman is somarginalized, that individuals do not seek a call. When a call comes—through a dream, a trance,recovery from an illness—the individual may be reluctant to act on it.The spirits will commonly call to the future shaman during a particularly difficult time oftheir lives, including periods of stress, illness, accident, possession, or near-death experiences.Shamans have been called “wounded healers” and are seen as people driven to be shamans bytheir own illnesses, possibly including psychosis or possession. The shamanic initiation oftenincludes the idea that the spirits eat, dismember, or kill the person before that person can bereborn as a shaman. The spirits are testing the initiate and the symbolism of death, transforma-tion, and rebirth are very common.The shaman often undergoes a period of training, usually with an older shaman. Althoughlearning religious knowledge is important, the main purpose of the training is to learn how to makecontact with the supernatural, a very dangerous activity, and how to manipulate the supernaturalworld in order to achieve some specified end. The candidate establishes a relationship with a spiritfamiliar who acts as his guide to the supernatural world. The period of apprenticeship may includeperiods of seclusion, fasting, and the taking of hallucinogens, but the main goal is to learn to enterinto and control the experience of an altered state of consciousness.THE SHAMANIC ROLE AND RITUALS.The shaman may contact the supernatural by traditional,standardized methods that fit our definition of ritual. The ritual is only a means for contacting andestablishing a relationship with a supernatural entity; it is not an end in itself. The success of ashaman lies not in her ability to memorize and perform rituals, but in her ability to successfullyestablish contact and some measure of control over the supernatural.The control of spirit helpers and the ability to enter altered states of consciousness arecentral to the role of shaman. These spirits help the shaman fight hostile spirits and also help theshaman diagnose and treat illnesses. Illness is often conceived of as resulting from soul loss(Chapter 8), and the shaman is called to recapture the patient’s soul by means of a mystical flight.The shamanic ritual may be a simple affair, say a private consultation between patient andshaman, or may be a major public ritual. In the latter, it is common for the ritual to be verydramatic, aided by the use of various almost theatrical techniques on the part of the shaman.Drumming, singing, dancing, and elaborate costumes contribute to this effect, as do the use ofventriloquism and sleight of hand. Using these techniques does not necessarily imply intent"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"122Chapter 6 • Religious Specialistsby the shaman to deceive onlookers. Shamans operate in the realm of the supernatural, whichothers are unable to perceive. Using sleight of hand may represent an attempt by the shaman torepresent and convince others of what they see as true accomplishments on the unseen level.The movement of the shaman between the realm of the natural and supernatural is oftenrelated to a worldview that sees humans living in a middle zone between an upper and lower world.The three worlds are seen as linked by a central vertical axis, often referred to as an Axis MundiorAxis of the World. An example already discussed is the Mayan World Tree seen on the sarcopha-gus of Lord Pakal in Chapter 3. The shaman is able to travel between these worlds, usually alongthis central axis. In shamanic rituals, a ladder, pole, or tree is often used to represent the axis.The shaman’s ability to make this soul journey to the supernatural realm is linked to his orher special abilities at transformation, which is often linked to other ideas of transformation suchas into animals or other beings. Also common is gender transformation, where the shaman wearsthe clothes of, or even takes on some of the social roles of, the opposite sex, or is seen as beingsexually ambiguous.Because of their ability to directly contact and manipulate the supernatural, members of ashaman’s community often regard them with some suspicion. The same powers that enable themto cure sickness could also be used to cause it. Priests do not have this same ability and so are notviewed with the same concern. Although priests are capable of the same personal evil that we allare, they have no special abilities to do so.Siberian ShamanismShamans of Central Siberia are religious specialists who use hand-held drums and spirit helpersto help the members of their community. Siberian shamans perform rituals to heal the sick,divine the future, and ensure success in the hunt. Here again the world is divided into threerealms. The upper realm is one of light and good spirits; the middle realm is the home of peopleand spirits of the earth; and the lower realm is one of darkness and evil spirits. It is the shaman’srole, while in an altered state of consciousness, to communicate with various spirits. The shamanmay also journey to one of the other realms.One of the main functions of the shaman is healing. This is accomplished in many ways. A shaman can communicate with spirits to learn what they want. He can also dispel a disease-causing spirit or retrieve a lost soul. A shaman has spirit familiars or animal soul that help in theshaman’s work. These spirits give the shaman his particular qualities and powers. It is by havingthese spirits that the shaman is able to heal, but they also give the shaman the potential to do harm.Other shamans specialize in contacting the spirits to help ensure a successful hunt. In thiscase the shaman contacts the spirits of an animal species and makes a deal with them. The animalspirits will supply humans with food, and the humans will eventually supply the spirits withhuman flesh and blood. This is one cause of human sickness and death. It is the role of the shamanto minimize the amount of human sickness while trying to maximize the number of animals thatwill be successfully hunted. Part of a shaman’s success in doing this is from a pact with the animalspirits through a special relationship with the daughter of the elk or reindeer spirit.YAKUT SHAMANISM.The Yakut or Shkha live in northeastern Siberia. Missionaries of theRussian Orthodox Church entered the region in the early eighteenth century. They found apeople living in small groups spread over a vast area, hunting, fishing, and herding horses andreindeer. Over time, many Yakut converted to Christianity, yet the practice of shamanismremained strong, and most people participated in both Orthodox and shamanic rituals. In 1931"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 • Religious Specialists123the Soviet government began a program designed to destroy the traditional religious practices bypersecuting shamans. Many were executed or deported. Ethnic Russians moved into the area andtoday outnumber the native population. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union and thecreation of the Republic of Shkha, a part of the Russian Federation, the ban on shamanism waslifted. With this came a sense of identity among the Yakut; shamanic rituals increased in frequency,and traditional beliefs were taught in the schools.Like many traditional peoples living in a modern state and exposed to different religiouspractices, Christian elements have entered into shamanic rituals and beliefs. For example,Takako Yamada quotes a shaman in 1994: “I didn’t see many gods in the upper world. I only sawJesus Christ, a woman god and one or two other gods. Jesus and the woman gave me a photo,asking me to look after the people in the world. So, I believe I have received a universal ability tocure not only the Yakut but also foreign people.”1Along with the revival of traditional shamanism have come new groups that often developaround a charismatic leader who combines shamanic and Christian elements and produces a newtype of religious practice. Marjorie Mandelstam Balzar describes a ritual performed by one suchleader, Kyta Baaly.2Although young and poorly educated, he has attracted a significant following.He performs rituals that are based on traditional Yakut practices, yet he claims to be the son ofJesus Christ. Followers wear a small “sacred world path” pin or pendant that combines a Christiancross with a tree symbol. This is an example of a revivalistic movement, a type of religiousphenomenon discussed more fully in Chapter 11.Korean ShamanismAlthough shamanism is usually thought of as a feature of small-scale religions, shamans are alsofound in many industrial societies. Korea has had a long history of shamanism. At one timeshamans, who were mostly men, had considerable political influence. Over time this influencewaned, and eventually shamans were persecuted and driven underground. Shamanism movedfrom being a prominent, public institution to being a more private, secretive activity. Today mostshamans are women. This provides many women with a good source of income and also giveswomen some degree of influence over the community. Shamanism is now becoming recognizedas an important part of Korean culture, and many aspects of shamanistic ritual, such as songs anddances, are being publicly performed for entertainment.Shamans are chosen by the spirits. Women who have experienced some type of psycholog-ical stress in their lives are especially vulnerable. The society believes that the spirits, in theirsearch for someone to possess, tend toward individuals whose ma ̆um, or soul, has already beenfractured and therefore been made vulnerable. The sign that a particular woman has been selectedis manifested as possession illness or sinby ̆ong. There are many physical and psychologicalsymptoms of sinby ̆ong, but the most significant is entrance into a trance state. The individual isill with possession sickness until she accepts the call of the spirits. Many individuals chosen bythe spirits are very reluctant to become shamans, who are considered by society to be socialdeviants. Finally, however, she apprentices herself to an experienced shaman who eventuallyperforms an initiation ritual that transforms her into a full-fledged shaman.Youngsook Kim Harvey recounts the description by a Korean shaman of the events whichled to her initiation.3Long before I had any indication of supernatural notification, I found myself feelingexcited by the rhythm of the changgu(“drum”).

You lose all sense ofembarrassment . . . all inhibition...you are suffused with the feeling, “I’m the num-ber one, the best—there is none else like me in the whole world!”Korean shamans are called to perform shamanic rituals for a number of reasons. Forexample, a shaman is called to guide the dead to the otherworld. During this ritual, the shamantakes the role of the deceased who is then able to communicate with the family. Shamanic ritualsare also performed to cure illnesses, for divination, and to ensure the good fortune of the familyand community.Pentecostal Healers as ShamansIf we are using the term shamanin its broad sense, then there are religious practitioners in theUnited States who also exhibit many of the same features. One example is Pentecostal faithhealers (see Box 6.1 for another example). Altered states of consciousness are achieved throughthe use of rhythmic speech and music. Participants in the ritual are often moved to shout, dance,run up and down the aisle, or cry. The healing ritual, known as “laying on hands,” generally takesplace during a service. The person in need of healing stands in front of the preacher, who isstanding in front of the altar. Others stand behind the person receiving the prayer in case heor she needs physical support. The preacher anoints the person’s head with oil and recitesincantations. The preacher may also rub the head, torso, back, or legs of the person. The wholecongregation may participate by clapping in unison during the healing. The Holy Spirit isbelieved to possess both the healer and the patient, which can lead either one of them to convulsesuddenly or begin speaking in tongues.Similar to shamans, many Pentecostal preachers report having been called by the supernat-ural, in this case God, and describe prophetic dreams and visions. Pentecostal preachers alsofunction similarly to shamans by using an altered state of consciousness to directly contact andexperience the supernatural for healing another individual.NeoshamanismThe last several decades have seen a growing interest in shamanism, primarily in the UnitedStates and Europe. Much of this can be traced to the publication of historian Mircea Eliade’sbook Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasyin 1951. This book was one of the first to look"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 • Religious Specialists125BOX 6.1Clown Doctors as ShamansAlthough Western medicine is undeniably effective in treating many diseases, it has been criticizedfor focusing only on the physical disease and neglecting the patient’s illness experience. In anattempt to address this issue, many complementary therapies have been introduced. One exampleis the use of clowns in pediatric hospitals. A study by Linda Miller Van Blerkom of the Big AppleCircus Clown Care Unit (CCU), which entertains children in New York City hospitals, suggests thatthese clowns have many similarities with traditional shamanic healers.The clowns dress in outlandish costumes that include a white doctor’s coat and a doctor’sbag filled with magic tricks and props. They are described as popping red foam-rubber clownnoses out of respirator tubing, hiding puppet animals under their coats, blowing bubbles, singinglullabies to children, doing magic tricks, dancing, and telling jokes. They distract patients duringpainful procedures and also interact with families and staff.Van Blerkom points out that both clowns and shamans mediate between order and chaos,sacred and profane, natural and supernatural, and that clowns with healing functions are knownfrom other cultures, particularly in Native American cultures. She notes several similarities be-tween shamans and clown doctors. For example, both wear unusual costumes and both areviewed with some ambivalence.The use of puppets by clown doctors is reminiscent of shamanic spirit helpers, and both usemusic and sleight of hand. Traditional shamans and clowns use suggestion and manipulation ofcultural symbols and pay more attention to the patient’s experience and social context thanWestern doctors typically do. Van Blerkom writes, “The clowns say they parody doctors and playwith hospital equipment to lighten up the atmosphere and make children less afraid of doctorsand their instruments, but one can also recognize another shamanistic function: psychosocial sup-port. By involving the social group, illness and curing are given public recognition and the patientreceives group support. Shamanistic rituals reinforce social roles and can be therapeutic for fami-lies struggling to cope with an illness and disorder.”Source: Linda Miller Van Blerkom, “Clown Doctors: Shaman Healers of Western Medicine,” Medical AnthropologyQuarterly,9 (1995): pp. 462–475.at common elements of shamanism cross-culturally and to focus on shamanism as a techniquefor achieving an altered state of consciousness. The interest in shamanism, however, really tookoff starting in the 1970s. Many cultural themes in the United States helped contribute to this,including the legacy of the 1960s drug culture, an interest in non-Western religions, environmen-talism, and the New Age, self-help, and self-realization movements. Popular anthropology worksalso contributed, largely through the work of Carlos Castaneda and Michael Harner.Carlos Castaneda, while a graduate student at UCLA, claimed he was apprenticed to aYaqui (Arizona) shaman named Don Juan Matus. Based on his experiences, he wrote a series ofbooks beginning with The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge,published in1968. The earliest books focused on the use of mind-altering drugs to experience another reality.Later, he moved his focus to a new technique of body movements, or magical passes, that hecalled tensegrity, a term borrowed from architect R. Buckminster Fuller, who coined the term as"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"126Chapter 6 • Religious Specialistsa combination of “tensional” and “integrity.” The aim of tensegrity is to increase awareness ofthe energy fields that, according to Castaneda, humans are made of. This is done through bodymovements and breathing, which Castaneda said were taught to him by Don Juan and which goback to ancient Mexico. Although Castaneda himself passed away in the late 1990s, workshopsin tensegrity continue to be offered.Castaneda’s work has been criticized by many academics as fictional, not true ethnography.No one has been able to verify the existence of Don Juan and experts in Yaqui culture have castdoubts on the accuracy of his accounts, among other issues.Michael Harner is an anthropologist who spent many years studying shamanism,primarily in the Americas (among the Jivaro in the Upper Amazon) and northern Europe(Saamiland). Harner felt that the insights he learned about shamanism from the Jivaro wereapplicable to all people in all places. He dubbed the concept core shamanism, which isdescribed on his website as “the near universal methods of shamanism without a specificcultural perspective.”4In 1980, Harner published The Way of the Shamanas a sort of self-helpbook for those in the West interested in pursuing shamanism; he now trains more than 5,000people each year in core shamanism. These training workshops take place all over NorthAmerica, Europe, and Latin America.Although Harner’s original work with the Jivaro centered on the use of the drug ayahuasca,he focuses now on drumming to achieve altered states of consciousness. In a typical workshop, theparticipants are told to lie down and relax with their eyes closed or covered. A leader then directsthem through either an exercise in guided imagery or a supernatural experience, depending on yourpoint of view. The participants are told to begin their journey by entering the earth at a place wellknown to them in the physical world, such as a cave. They then travel down tunnels to the “lowerworld,” where they meet and interact with spirit teachers and power animals.Those who use techniques like those proposed by Castaneda and Harner are known asneoshamansto distinguish them from more classical shamans. There are many significantdifferences between the two. Neoshamanism is focused on an individual, often as a self-helpmeans of improving one’s life. Neoshamans choose to participate and focus on whatthey consider the positive aspects of shamanism. More traditionally, shamanism is focused onhelping the community. Shamans are chosen but may resist the call because of the dark sideof shamanism that neoshamans often ignore. The shamanic trance is often described as a terri-fying experience, and shamans are often marginalized and feared because of their ability to dogreat evil.Neoshamanism has also been criticized for presenting shamanic beliefs and practices outof their cultural context through such concepts as core shamanism. A single practitioner maychoose bits and pieces from many different cultures. Harsher criticisms accuse neoshamanism ofcultural imperialism, neocolonial attitudes, and perpetuating racist stereotypes of indigenouspeople. Harner and others are seen as profiting from the commodification of indigenous identity,beliefs, and practices. Although some indigenous healers do encourage neoshamanism andare willing to teach, this is a very contentious issue, one that speaks to the larger issue of whocontrols cultural symbols and rituals.PRIESTSPriestsare full-time religious specialists associated with formalized religious institutions thatmay be linked with kinship groups, communities, or larger political units and are given religiousauthority by those units or by formal religious organizations. Priesthoods tend to be found in"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 • Religious Specialists127more complex food-producing societies, whereas shamans are associated with technologicallysimpler ones. Generally speaking, a society will contain either priests or shamans but seldomboth. (Here we are using the term priestas a generic term that includes a wide variety of practi-tioners, including ministers and rabbis.)A priest acts as a representative of the community in dealing with the deity or deities. In thiscapacity, priests are responsible for the performance of prescribed rituals. These include periodicrituals on a ceremonial calendar that is usually tied to the agricultural cycle. A priest also performsrites of passage such as birth and death rituals and weddings, as well as performing rituals in theevent of disaster and illness. A priest’s skill is based on learning ritual knowledge and sacrednarratives and on knowledge of how to perform these rituals for the benefit of the community.However, a particular ritual might or might not result in the desired end. A ritual performed for arain god to end a drought might result in a rainstorm or a continuing drought. But the failure of theritual to work is not necessarily due to the activities of the priest; it might be due to the will of thedeity who has made the decision whether or not to let the rains come.Although priests may contend with important, practical matters, such as the success ofcrops or the curing of illnesses, they are also associated with rituals that have more generalizedpurposes. These purposes are usually articulated in social rites of intensification and deal withthe reinforcement of the belief system and the established ethical code. Priestly rituals legitimizecommunity ventures—for example, the coronation of the British monarch by the Archbishop ofCanterbury—and, on a more personal level, establish the legitimacy of a child as a member ofthe community.Priests also are individuals who personify the image of the ideal person. They are modelsof ethics and morality in their communities, and they are held to higher standards of behaviorthan is the population at large. When a priest fails to live up to these standards, the significanceis much greater than when another person fails in the same way. This is why revelations of childmolestation by Catholic priests are considered exceptionally heinous and shocking.Priestly rituals usually take place in a space that is set aside for ceremonial activities, whichis considered to be sacred space. It is usually a community space as well. It may be an outdoorarea or a structure, and the structure may be large enough that the entire community can enter andparticipate in the rituals. However, in many societies the ceremonial structure—a shrine or atemple—is a place where sacred objects are kept and into which only a priest may enter.The training of a priest usually involves memorization of vast amounts of knowledge, for thevery survival of the community might depend on the priest’s competence in the performance ofrituals. Individuals become priests for a variety of reasons. Often it is an inherited responsibility, aswhen a priestly office is passed on from father to son. Many societies have priestly lineages, such asthe Levites of the Old Testament, or priestly classes or castes, such as the Brahmins of Hinduism.Sometimes the position of priest is one of great prestige and power, and one enters the priesthood tofurther one’s standing in the community. At the conclusion of training, the priest is formally recog-nized as a religious authority by the community through a rite of passage, such as an ordination.Priests also may have received a divine call, sometimes in dreams, visions, or trances. Insome societies a person becomes a priest after being cured of an illness. The very fact of beingcured may be taken as a sign of divine favor. In other societies the reason for entering the priesthoodmight be more practical. In Europe in the nineteenth century one of the only ways a middle-classman could get an education was by joining the priesthood. Research and teaching would be impor-tant components of his responsibilities. It was the custom in some agricultural societies that theoldest son inherited the land, the middle son entered the military, and the youngest son enteredthe priesthood."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"128Chapter 6 • Religious SpecialistsHowever, no matter what the reason, the novice must have the aptitude and ability to learnthe required elements of priestly duties. Although a priest may connect with the supernaturalthrough visions and trances, this ability is not as important as the priest’s ability to memorize andperform rituals in the proper manner.Zuni PriestsThe Zuni, a pueblo people of the American Southwest culture area, developed religious practicesthat involved a complex of priests. This complex of priestly societies forms the basis of Zunireligious and political organization.Young males, rarely females, are inducted into one of the six kiva groups that exist in Zunisociety. A kiva is a ceremonial chamber, a sacred space analogous to a shrine or temple. Amongthe Zuni, kivas are rectangular rooms built above ground. (This is different than the more famil-iar circular underground kivas found among other pueblo peoples and so commonly seen inarchaeological sites.) The six kivas are associated with the six cardinal directions, which includethe familiar north, east, south, and west but also the zenith overhead and the nadir underground.Ritual responsibilities rotate among the six kiva groups. The major responsibility of the priests ofeach kiva group is the accurate performance of rituals. This involves the manipulation of sacredobjects and the recitation of prayers.Zuni society also recognizes many other priesthoods. They include the priests of thetwelve medicine societies that both men and women join when they are cured of an illnessbecause of the work of the medicine society. If a man takes a scalp in battle, he joins the warriorsociety. In time a man may join a number of priesthoods. The accumulation of ritual knowledgeover time is associated with prestige and political authority.Zuni political authority is vested in a council of priests led by the priest of the sun andkeeper of the calendar. Their major concern is with religious matters, such as selecting some ofthe participants in certain rituals, the placement of occasional rituals into the ritual calendar, andthe reaction of the religious organization to natural disasters. They appoint a civil administrationto handle nonreligious matters.Okinawan PriestessesOkinawa, located southwest of the main islands of Japan, was once the independentkingdom of Ryukyus. Although the language, culture, and religious beliefs are very similarto those of Japan, there are considerable differences as well. Okinawa’s indigenous religionwas based on animism and shamanism, but has been heavily influenced by Shinto,Buddhism, and Taoism—entering from Japan and China. Like Shinto, Okinawan religionsees the world as inhabited by a myriad of supernatural beings referred to as kami. By pla-cating and pleasing the kamithrough rituals, misfortune can be avoided and blessingsgained.There are a variety of religious specialists, all of whom are women (Figure 6.2).Okinawa is the only known society in which women lead a mainstream, official, publiclyfunded religion that is practiced by both sexes. The two main specialists are priestesses,kaminchu,and shamanlike practitioners called yuta. The yutamediate between the villagersand the supernatural by communicating with the ancestors and the kami. They practice divina-tion as well as healing rituals. Whereas each yutahas one or more kamithat she communicateswith regularly, the kaminchuis believed to actually embody a particular kamiassociated withthe clan."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 • Religious Specialists129FIGURE 6.2Okinawan Priestess.Priestessesperform during a ceremony honoring victims ofthe 1945 bombing of Nagasaki.Kaminchurituals are funded by the village council or clan and take place at the villageprayer house in the village square, in clan houses, or in sacred groves.

They do not preach, perform rites of passage, or heal—they sit and eat. However,like the kamithemselves, they are believed to emit good spiritual energy. The villagers also like tohave the kaminchuaround at events such as housewarmings and agricultural festivals.The role of kaminchuis semihereditary. Each clan has a certain number of kaminchupositions that can only be filled by female members of the clan. Within some clans, certainpositions can only be filled by women of certain families. The role of chief kaminchufor avillage is traditionally passed from mother to daughter.Susan Sered compared the stories told by kaminchu(priestesses) and yuta(shamans) ofhow they attained their positions.5Both types of religious practitioners told of illnesses, butSered found significant differences between the two. The kaminchureported minor illnesses thatgenerally involved some sort of bleeding or other bodily rupture. The Okinawan worldview seesthe body as whole and sealed and this illness event was seen as opening the path for the embod-iment of the kami. However, the illness is small and symbolic. It does not make the women intoa kaminchubut is considered a sign or reminder of what she was born to be.In contrast, the illnesses reported by the yutainvolved serious psychological, physical, orsocial dysfunction.

Overcoming the illness was"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130Chapter 6 • Religious Specialistsseen as proof that the yutawould be effective in her role and also had the ability to understand thesuffering of others. The status of yutais more ambiguous and the question being answered in thestories they told was why a person would take on such a role.Eastern Orthodox PriestsReligious organizations associated with nation-states or multistate organizations are character-ized by many types of priests organized in complex hierarchical organizations, such as those ofthe Roman Catholic Church. In contrast to the Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Churchesconsist of a series of independent religious organizations. Some are associated with particularnations, such as the Greek Orthodox Church, but others are not. Within the church are manyreligious specialists who fall within our definition of priest. These specialists are organized intoa complex religious hierarchy. The head of a region is the bishop. Each bishop is independent ofother bishops, although bishops at several levels will form various councils. The specialistswho are called priests are usually assigned to particular churches and are responsible for theperformance of rituals. Finally there are the deacons who assist the priests in the performance ofrituals and works under their direction.The Orthodox Church has a strong tradition of asceticism where individuals separate them-selves from the everyday world and spend their lives as monks and nuns. Monks are ordainedpriests, but instead of functioning in the outside world, they live in various types of isolated com-munities, such as monasteries or small villages; some live a semi-solitary life as hermits associatedwith a nearby monastery. Bishops are normally selected from among the monks and most Orthodoxseminaries are associated with monasteries. Bishops are celibate but men who are already marriedmay become priests and deacons, although upon the death of their spouse they cannot remarry.Orthodox priests participate in a wide variety of activities including education and coun-seling, but the focus of their responsibilities is the performance of rituals. They are primarilyinvolved with the performance of social rites of intensification that center around the DivineLiturgy or communion service. The priest also performs rites of passage associated with birth,baptism, marriage and death. This knowledge and authority comes from the church.OTHER SPECIALISTSWhile shamans and priests are major and well-studied types of religious specialists, many otherspecialists practice in various limited ways. The labels that are used to refer to these specialists oftenoverlap extensively and are not used in any consistent manner. Some of their functions overlap thoseof shamans and priests. In this section we will look at healers, herbalists, diviners, and prophets.Healers and DivinersThe term healeris often used to refer to a priest or shaman, especially when the individual isfocused on the curing of illness or injury. However, more specialized healersalso exist. Manyactivities of healers are similar to those of U.S. medical practitioners. For example, they may setbones, treat sprains with cold, or administer drugs made from native plants and other materials.Many governments have used traditional healers as conduits for the introduction of new practicesin nutrition and public health (Box 6.2).One type of healer is the herbalist. Herbalists are specialists in the use of plant and othermaterial as cures. The herbalist may prescribe the materials to be administered or may provide thematerial as prescribed by a healer or diviner.

Today Western med-icine also plays an important role. A great many native Africans have been trained as doctors,nurses, and other health practitioners, and large hospitals have been built in urban centers. Yetthe majority of the population has little access to Western medicine. Hospitals and clinics are oftennot available in rural areas, and the cost of medical services and medicines is often prohibitive.Today a great deal of money is available to African countries to fight many diseases, espe-cially HIV/AIDS. Yet in spite of the available funding, there is a critical shortage of trained healthworkers. For example, in Uganda there is only one medical practitioner for every 10,000 individu-als, and most are found in urban areas.On the other hand, in Uganda there is one traditional healer for every 200–400 individuals,and the healers are found in all communities and are always “on call.” A solution to the problemsof making basic health education and services available to rural communities is to recognize theimportance and effectiveness of healers in many medical situations. In addition, healers can betrained in many aspects of Western medicine, thus forming a partnership between traditionalhealing and medicine. Healers are available and trusted members of the community and thereforecan have a major impact on the general state of health in these areas.Many programs have been developed in Africa to train native healers in medical techniques.One such group is PROMETRA, the Association for the Promotion of Traditional Medicine. Theorganization estimates that about 85 percent of the people in sub-Saharan Africa receive theirhealthcare from traditional healers. The organization provides medical training to healers while at thesame time promoting native healing methods. Experiences between native populations andEuropean powers fostered a deep mistrust between the medical establishments of colonialgovernments and local healers. This mistrust is now being overcome. For example, traditional healersrecognize symptoms of HIV/AIDS and can refer patients to medical facilities. They can also monitorinfant health and practice infant oral rehydration; dehydration is a major cause of infant mortality.Sources: National Council of Traditional Healers and Herbalists Associations of Uganda (www.blackherbals.com/nacotha1.htm); PROMETRA (www.prometra.org); S.

Herbalists are intimately familiar with the various plantmaterials in the habitat and gather, process, and administer various medicines made from thesematerials. However, much of the theory of curing is based on principles of magic to be discussed inChapter 7.A divineris someone who practices divination, a series of techniques and activities thatare used to obtain information about things that are not normally knowable. These may includethings that will happen in the future, things that are occurring at the present time but at adistance, and things that touch the supernatural, such as the identification of a witch. Somedivination techniques involve the interpretation of natural phenomena or some activity, such asthe turning over of cards. Other techniques involve the diviner entering an altered state ofconsciousness and, while in that state, obtaining the requested information."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"132Chapter 6 • Religious SpecialistsDiviners usually focus on very practical questions: What is a good time to plant my crop?Will my investment pay off? Whom should I marry? What is an auspicious day for a marriage?A very important type of information that diviners provide is the cause of illness. The divineroften provides the diagnosis, and the healer provides the cure. Diviners usually, but not always,work for private clients and are paid for their services. Divination is discussed in Chapter 7.ProphetsA prophetis a mouthpiece of the gods. It is the role of a prophet to communicate the words andwill of the gods to his or her community and to act as an intermediary between the gods and thepeople. Although shamans may occasionally function as prophets, in many cases the role ofprophet is a separate one. Prophets are found in a wide variety of cultures and include the famil-iar examples of Moses and Mohammad.Handsome Lake was a prophet of the Seneca tribe (Eastern Woodlands culture area) duringthe time when the reservation system was first imposed. In 1799 Handsome Lake became ill andappeared to have died. His body was prepared for burial, but he revived. He said that he had hada vision of three messengers who had revealed to him God’s will and told him that he was tocarry this message back to his people. Later the same year he received a second revelation inwhich he was shown heaven and hell and was given moral instructions, which were very similarto Christian ideas. Handsome Lake received further revelations in subsequent years. On the basisof his visions, he preached a revitalization of traditional seasonal ceremonies, strengthening thefamily, and a prohibition against alcohol. Handsome Lake’s teachings continued to spread afterhis death in 1815 and ultimately became the foundation for the Longhouse religion.The Nuer, a cattle-herding people living in the Eastern Sudan culture area, have a historyof prophets. One example is Ngundeng, a nineteenth-century Nuer prophet. He was born in thelate 1830s. Of course, there are no historical records of his life, but there are many stories, espe-cially those told by his family. According to tradition, he was conceived after his mother was pastmenopause and was born after a twelve-month pregnancy. Ngundeng is said to have spokento his mother at birth and to possess a number of physical characteristics that were attributed todivine influence. Unlike some prophets who make contact with supernatural power later on inlife, Ngundeng was born with that power.As a young man he had seizures, or altered states of consciousness. He also showed verystrange behaviors such as wandering alone in the bush, fasting, and drinking nothing but waterfor long periods of time. As he began to eat tobacco, mud, grass, and human feces, he becamevery thin, and his hair grew long and matted. Then he was possessed by a god, who revealed him-self to be Deng. Ngundeng, as Deng’s prophet, began to make prophecies, and because Dengcontrolled both life and death, Ngundeng developed a reputation as a peacemaker.The Nuer believe that prophets are chosen by a god and are then able to predict the future,cure the sick, ensure the fertility of women and cows, influence the growth of a good crop, andso forth. Stories began to circulate about Ngundeng’s further ability to take a life through wordsor even thoughts. The ability to kill was the other side of the coin of controlling life. The godDeng was a lifegiver, controlling rain and the procreation of cattle and children, but he was alsoa god of death. Ngundeng gained a wide reputation for making barren women fertile and haltingepidemic disease. He died in 1906.Over 100 years later, the prophet Ngundeng is playing an important role in the movementfor an independent state in southern Sudan. Ngundeng had a dangor ceremonial rod which wasinherited by Ngundeng’s son. When the son was killed in battle in the resistance against British"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 • Religious Specialists133colonial rule, the dangwas taken as a souvenir to England. Years later, the dangwas sold atauction to a British scholar, Douglas Johnson, who has studied the Nuer and the life ofNgundeng. Douglas returned it to the Nuer in 2009 (Figure 6.3). The rod has become a symbolof the Nuer’s drive for independence from Sudan.CONCLUSIONSo far in this book, we have discussed many of the basic concepts and components ofreligious systems, such as narratives, worldview, symbols, rituals, altered states of conscious-ness, and ritual specialists. Religious specialists often are the main repositories of religiousknowledge, retelling key narratives, manipulating religious symbols, and entering into alteredstates of consciousness through their ritual practices. Specialists play a key role as mediatorsbetween the natural and supernatural worlds. As we move into the next section of the book,we will shift our attention to those supernatural forces and beings. Again, all of these topicsare tied together. For example, the conceptions people have of the nature of the godsinfluence the character of the rituals that will be directed toward the gods. An importantfactor in a culture’s worldview is how and in what ways supernatural phenomena and powersmanifest themselves.FIGURE 6.3Ngundeng’sDang.The dangor ceremonial rod of the Nuer prophet Ngundeng isreturned by anthropologist Douglas Johnson (right) to the Nuer on May 16, 2009.

Two of themost frequently found specialists are shamansand priests.A shaman receives his or her power directlyfrom the spirit world and acquires the ability to dosacred things through personal communicationwith the supernatural. Shamans are part-timeindependent contractors whose authority lies intheir charisma and ability to heal. A Siberian shamanworks with a spirit familiar or animal soul thathelps the shaman in his or her work of dispelling adisease-causing spirit or retrieving a lost soul.Priests are full-time religious specialistswho are associated with formalized religiousinstitutions and tend to be found in more complexfood-producing societies. The priest acts as a rep-resentative of the community to the deity ordeities and is responsible for the performance ofprescribed rituals. The skill of a priest is based onthe learning of ritual knowledge and sacred narra-tives and on knowledge of how to perform theserituals for the benefit of the community. Priestlyrituals usually take place in a space that is setaside for ceremonial activities, such as a templeor shrine.Other kinds of religious specialists includeherbalists, diviners, and prophets. A prophet is amouthpiece of the gods. It is the role of the prophetto communicate the words and will of the gods tohis or her community and act as an intermediarybetween the people and the gods.Suggested ReadingsNicholas Black Elk (as told through John G.

What ispopularly called magicwe will call illusion,because magic in this sense refers toacts that rely on some sort of trickery and deception. Entertainers in our culture who performsuch illusions freely admit that they are manipulating not the supernatural world, but ratherhuman perception. Magic,as anthropologists use the term, refers to activities, usually rituals, bywhich a person can compel the supernatural to behave in certain ways. Closely related to magicare supernatural ways of gaining information about the unknown, be it what will happen in thefuture, what is happening in some faraway place, or the cause of an illness. These techniquesare aspects of divination.THE WORLD OF MAGICMagicrefers to methods that somehow interface with the supernatural and by which people canbring about particular outcomes. It may be used for the public good, although sorcerersgenerallyare considered evil figures who deal in matters that are downright antisocial. Of course, many otherreligious specialists, such as healers, use magic in their activities.Magic and ReligionEarly anthropologists were quite ethnocentric when it came to the study of magic, often placingit in a separate category from religion. Today most anthropologists consider magic to be a part ofreligion because it is associated with supernatural mechanisms, but many earlier anthropologists(and some contemporary ones) have used other criteria to place magic in a separate category.Edward Tylor, who discussed magic in his book Primitive Cultures,published in 1871,wrote that magic is a logical way of thinking.1The problem is that the logic is based on badpremises. Tylor believed that in tribal cultures the magician takes the same approach as ascientist, but the magician makes the mistake of assuming a causal relationship simply becausethings appear to be similar, when this relationship does not exist. In addition, Tylor did notinclude magic in the realm of religion because no spirits are involved, which he considerednecessary for his definition of religion.CHAPTERMagic and Divination7"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"James Frazer, like Tylor, believed that magic was a pseudoscience, based on direct action.2Frazer was a part of the evolutionary school (Chapter 1) and thought that magic was an early stagethat would be replaced by religion. Religion was seen as different from magic because it is based onpersuasion of supernatural beings rather than manipulation of supernatural forces. Some evolution-ary school thinkers believed that ultimately religion itself would give way to science. Of course,none of this has happened; in most societies magic, religion, and science coexist.Émile Durkheim also thought that magic could be distinguished from religion, but hefocused on the social context.3Unlike religious rituals that tend to involve the whole of thecommunity, magic is often centered on the needs and desires of an individual. A farmer wantsrain, a young man wants a wife, a woman needs a cure for her illness. In contrast to religiousrituals that are carried out for the good of the community, magic is directed at very practical endsas articulated by an individual. Durkheim wrote, “In all history, we do not find a single religionwithout a church. . . . There is no church of magic.”4However, generalizations are just that.Magic is frequently used in communitywide public rituals to bring rain or defend the communityagainst an enemy.Another related difference is seen in the purpose of the magic or religious ritual. Religion isseen as “an end in itself.” Malinowski wrote: “While in the magical act the underlying idea andaim is always clear, straightforward, and definite, in the religious ceremony there is no purposedirected toward a subsequent event.”5Some nonmagical rituals certainly have very specificgoals—coming-of-age ceremonies, for example—but many rituals are more generalized, especiallysocial rites of intensification.The issue of whether or not magic is part of religion or a separate category altogether islargely a function of how religion itself is defined (Chapter 1). Here we are using a very broaddefinition of religion that easily accommodates magic as it is used in this text.Magic and ScienceIn industrial societies science provides techniques for dealing with difficult and adversesituations. For example, if someone falls ill, science may provide an explanation (e.g., a bacterialinfection) and a course of action to combat the illness (e.g., administer an antibiotic).All peoples have rational means for dealing with difficult and potentially dangeroussituations. Although some anthropologists have labeled such activities science,it is not scienceas we use the term in the industrial world. In the scientific community, science is a methodologyfor coming to an understanding of our world through objective observations, experimentation,and the development of hypothesesand theories.Science deals only with empiricalobservations, that is, observations that are madethrough our senses, such as using vision to examine animal tissue under a microscope. Scientificconclusions also must be testable. This means that scholars must be able to develop newexperiments and make new observations that will test the validity of a conclusion with thevery real possibility that the hypothesis may be false. However, all peoples make detailedobservations about their world and sometimes manipulate objects in their environment in orderto come to some understanding of their world. All peoples have systems of technology that userational and practical methods to achieve certain objectives.As an example, consider a subsistence farmer who is growing crops to feed his family. A lot isriding on his success. Failure to produce an adequate crop could lead to malnutrition or starvation forhis family. A subsistence farmer is very knowledgeable about his craft. He is familiar with varioustypes of soils, knows the best time to plant, and knows how to build a fence to keep out wild animals.Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination137"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"138Chapter 7 • Magic and DivinationHowever, no matter how carefully and skillfully the farmer performs his task or lives hislife, bad things can and do happen. Rains might fail to come, or an infestation of insect pestsmight destroy his plants. He probably wonders, “Why is this happening to me? What can I do toprevent these things from happening?” To answer these questions, the farmer might turn toreligious ritual to invoke the influence of a deity. Perhaps he will present an offering to a god andask the god to help, perhaps to bring rain. Or he might build a small spirit house in the corner ofhis field and, by presenting the spirit with food offerings, try to persuade the spirit to take upresidence and guard the fields. However, these activities depend on the goodwill of the god orspirit, who might or might not be inclined to do as the farmer asks.Another approach is to somehow control the situation directly. Perhaps there is a way inwhich our farmer can connect to the supernatural world and bring about a desired end. This iswhat we mean by magic. Magic consists of activities, usually rituals, by which the farmer canautomatically produce certain results, such as rain for his crop. There is no god or spirit toconvince to help him. All the farmer needs is knowledge of how to perform the magic, and theresult—rain or protection from wild animals—will happen.Rules of MagicMagic tends to follow certain principles. These were first described by James Frazer in his bookThe Golden Boughoriginally published in 1890.6Frazer articulated the Law of Sympathy, whichstates that magic depends on the apparent association or agreement between things. There are twoparts to the Law of Sympathy. The first is the Law of Similarity, which states that things that arealike are the same. The second is the Law of Contagion, which states that things that were once incontact continue to be connected after the connection is severed. The Law of Similarity gives riseto homeopathic, or imitative,magicand the Law of Contagion gives rise to contagious magic.HOMEOPATHIC MAGIC.Homeopathic or imitative magic assumes that there is a causal rela-tionship between things that appear to be similar. The similarity can be physical or behavioral.The most familiar kind of homeopathic magic is image magic. This is the practice of making animage to represent a living person or animal, which can then be killed or injured through doingthings to the image, such as sticking pins into the image or burning it. The first may cause painin the body of the victim that corresponds to the place on the image where the pin was stuck;burning the image might bring about a high fever. Animals drawn on the walls of caves witharrows through them might be an example of image magic. Here the artist is creating the huntin art. Depicting a successful hunt will bring about a similar outcome in the real hunt.There are many examples of behaviors that imitate a desired end, causing the end to occur.Sometimes these are found embedded within rituals that are not specifically seen as magic rituals.An example is the increase riteof the Australian Aborigines. These are essentially fertility ritualsthat function to facilitate the successful reproduction of the totem animal (Chapter 3). They areperformed annually and are seen as essential parts of the animals’ life cycle. The men who performthe ritual draw sacred designs on their bodies and place various objects on their persons. In this waythe men become the totem animal in a magical sense. Their behavior, which is often expressed indance, brings about a sympathetic behavior in the actual animal. For example, the acting out of thecopulation and birth of an animal species will translate into reproductive success for those animals.The principle of sympathy explains many folk customs, including those in American soci-ety. Folklorist Wayland D. Hand has collected many examples, such as walnuts being good forthe brain.7After all, does not the shell resemble a skull and the meat inside resemble the brain?"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination139Many of the practices that are labeled “alternative medicine” or “homeopathic medicine”in American society are based on the Law of Similarity. Traditional herbal medicine is oftenbased on the doctrine of signatures. This is the belief that signs telling of a plant’s medical useare somehow embedded within the structure and nature of the plant itself. Some believe that Godprovided these signatures so that people could ascertain the use of particular plants in healing.For example, red cloverhead is used to treat problems of the blood, as is the red sap of thebloodroot. Indigestion is treated by several yellow plants associated with the yellow color ofthe bile that is often vomited up. The fused leaves of the boneset plant are used, as the plant’sname suggests, to heal broken bones.Similar analogies appear to be the basis of many food prohibitions observed by pregnantwomen among the Beng of the Ivory Coast, West Africa. A pregnant woman is told not to eatmeat from the bushbuck antelope, which has a striped coat. If she does, her child will be bornwith striped skin. During pregnancy a women should give herself enemas using a particular vinethat has slippery leaves; then the infant will move quickly through the birth canal during birth.The soon-to-be new mother is also told that her behavior during her pregnancy will be reflectedin her child, especially negative behaviors. A pregnant woman who steals will have a child withthe long arm of a thief. Some Americans think that if the mother is anxious or nervous duringpregnancy, the baby will be nervous and fussy.CONTAGIOUS MAGIC.Contagious magic is based on the premise that things that were once incontact always maintain a connection. An example of contagious magic from our own culture isthe rabbit’s foot. The rabbit is a successful animal, but not because it is intelligent. It is a preyanimal for a wide variety of other animals, but there are numerous rabbits. This must mean thatthe predators are not always successful. Because rabbits are not smart, they must be lucky. If wecarry a part of this lucky animal, the luck will rub off on us.Wayland Hand notes that there are many examples of folk medicine in the United Statesthat are based on the principle of contagion. Many of these involve transference of the diseaseinto some object. The object could then be disposed of, thus curing the illness. Warts could becured by rubbing a penny on the wart and then burying the coin. One cure for whooping coughwas to tie a caterpillar in a band around the neck of the child. The illness disappeared as thecaterpillar died, the disease having been successfully transferred to the animal.We also see the principle of contagion in modern U.S. society with the collection of, andprices paid for, anything used by a celebrity. A sweaty shirt worn by one of your professors in theclassroom would get a very different reaction than would a shirt that had been worn by yourfavorite rock star or actor.The following example comes from New Guinea. If a man has been hit in battle by anarrow, his friends will bind up the wound and put a cool poultice on it to keep the fever down andmake him comfortable. They will also put a poultice on the arrow, which they have taken out ofthe wound, because it was connected with the wound, and this too will help with the cure. Theenemy who fired the arrow, however, is likely to be practicing counter-magic. Back in his camphe will keep the bow near the fire and twang the string from time to time because the bow firedthe arrow that made the wound, and through this connection he can send twinges of pain.Anything connected with the person can be used in contagious magic. If you can get hair,a nail cutting, or even a belonging (such as clothes), you can do your worst to the person it camefrom. In fact, a hair from your enemy’s head is likely to be the first thing any sorcerer would askyou for before taking on a contract to liquidate the enemy. You can attack someone through hisor her footprint, name, shadow, or reflection (although a few of these also involve soul beliefs)."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"140Chapter 7 • Magic and DivinationThe Function of MagicWhen Malinowski studied the Trobriand Islanders (discussed later in this chapter), he noted that theydid not use magic in lagoon fishing because it is not dangerous. However, open-sea fishing is danger-ous and is accompanied by extensive rituals designed to assure safety and success. He writes: “We donot find magic wherever the pursuit is certain, reliable, and well under the control of rational methodsand technological processes. Further, we find magic where the element of danger is conspicuous.”8However, Annette Weiner notes that although lagoon fishing is relatively safe, there areother reasons to perform magic in the lagoon environment. She writes: “They ‘turn’ to magic, notout of psychological distress over a physical environment out of control, but when it is essentialthat they produce a large catch that must be used for an important exchange that has social andpolitical consequences. To control the actions of the wind and the fish is ultimately proof of one’sability to control an exchange, thereby providing a measure of control over others.”9A similar connection between magic and uncertainty can be found in athletics. Of course,skill and practice play a major role in athletic prowess, but poor athletes sometimes do excep-tionally well, whereas great athletics will hit a patch of “bad luck.” Because much is riding onperformance, athletes frequently attempt to control “luck” through magical behavior.Anthropologist and former professional baseball player George Gmelch describes magicalbehavior among athletes.10On each pitching day for the first three months of a winning season, Dennis Grossini, apitcher on the Detroit Tiger farm team, arose from bed at exactly 10:00 A.M. At 1:00 P.M.he went to the nearest restaurant for two glasses of ice tea and a tuna fish sandwich.Although the afternoon was free, he changed into the sweatshirt and supporter hewore during his last winning game, and one hour before the game he chewed a wad ofBeech-Nut chewing tobacco. After each pitch during the game he touched the letters onhis uniform and straightened his cap after each ball. Before the start of each inning hereplaced the pitcher’s rosin bag next to the spot where it was the inning before. And afterevery inning in which he gave up a run, he washed his hands.When asked which part of the ritual was most important, he said, “You can’treally tell what’s most important so it all becomes important. I’d be afraid to changeanything. As long as I’m winning, I do everything the same.”Where do these ritual behaviors come from? They come from what appears to be an asso-ciation between an activity and a result. Most people do not believe in coincidence. The juxtapo-sition of a behavior with a desired result—the eating of a tuna sandwich before a game in whichthe pitcher pitches a perfect game, for example—is seen in terms of one causing the other. Thepitcher will from that point on religiously eat a tuna sandwich before each game as a method ofensuring success. Gmelch notes that such rituals are found most frequently in those areas that aremost difficult to control and are therefore most influenced by random fluctuations of success,such as pitching. This behavior among baseball players closely resembles the behavior ofTrobriand Islanders engaging in fishing or trading voyages on the open ocean.Why Magic WorksNot all magic is directed or purposeful. It is possible to set something in motion without beingaware of it, without deliberately performing a ritual. For example, if you break a mirror, you setin motion events that will result in bad luck. This is why many people are careful not to step on"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination141a crack in the sidewalk and not to let a black cat cross their paths. You have not offended a deitywho is extracting punishment. You have unwittingly pressed the wrong button and the result—bad luck—will automatically happen.This perceived relationship between doing something and what appears to be a resultof that action is the basis of much behavior in all societies, including our own. I find a coinon the sidewalk that I place in my pocket. The next day something good happens—Iunexpectedly receive a raise. In the world of logic and science the juxtaposition of twoevents does not necessarily imply causality. It does not suggest that the presence of the coinin my pocket is responsible for my good fortune. It is most likely simply coincidence andnothing more.However, the human mind frequently sees coincidence as evidence of causation. A studentwears a particular shirt to a final exam and earns a grade of A in spite of not having had enoughtime to study. Although doing well can be attributed to hard work, there is always an element ofuncertainty. A student might study hard for an exam yet find a question on material that, for somereason, was not studied very extensively—bad luck. Or the question might just happen to beexactly on the material that was well prepared—good luck. When good luck happens, it is oftenattributed to some outside entity, such as a piece of clothing or object that was being worn orcarried that day, or perhaps to the fact that the student behaved in a particular way before theexam—drinking a particular beverage in a particular location, for example.Tylor addressed the question of why people believe that magic works. The answer isbecause magic appears never to fail. There are several reasons for this. First, magic often attemptsto bring about events that will occur naturally. Rain magic works because it will eventually rain.Rain magic often is performed at the end of the dry season, when rain is badly needed. Of course,the onset of rains normally follows the end of the dry season. However, the practitioners of suchmagic do not see it that way. The rain comes not naturally, but as a result of the ritual. The proofis very simple: You perform the ritual, and it rains. We could perform an experiment and try toconvince a community not to perform rain magic to see what would happen, but to people whodepend on their crops for survival this would be a very foolish thing to do. In addition, humans arevery resistant to changing their beliefs, even when presented with evidence to the contrary.This observation is important in understanding the use of magic and other healing rituals incuring illness. In our society over 90 percent of all illnesses, including colds and fevers, willeventually disappear, with or without treatment. Therefore in the vast majority of illnesses a curewill naturally follow the ritual. Again we have to assess the juxtaposition of the ritual and the endof the illness—a case of cause and effect.People do not generally ask impossible things of magic. Magic to bring rain at the end ofthe dry season or to make a garden grow is likely to work. Magic to enable a student to pass anexam without studying or to be able to fly off the roof of a building is likely to fail. No one triesto grow his or her garden by magic alone. There is a natural world that demands a naturalresponse (you must plant correctly and weed and water your garden), and there is a supernaturalworld that demands a supernatural response (you must make sure no supernatural harm comes toyour garden and try to gain supernatural help for its success).Of course, if you do not get the expected results, it could be because you did not do it right;the failure is with the magician, not the magic. In fact, if the belief is that the ritual must beperformed without error for it to succeed, failure of the ritual is direct evidence that the magicianmade an error. Also, someone else could be doing counter-magic; one person’s failure is anotherperson’s success. Magic might be performed by two opposing entities, and the more powerfulwill prevail over the weaker. For example, one village might be using magic to kill members of"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"142Chapter 7 • Magic and Divinationanother village, whereas people in the latter village might be performing magic to prevent illnessand death. Thus warfare is being conducted on a supernatural plane.Finally, there is the issue of selective memory. We do not remember everything thathappens to us. Some things are etched in our memories; other things are quickly forgotten.Successes, even if infrequent, are remembered and are thought of as proof that something works.Memories of failures, even if common, quickly fade with time.There are documented cases of magic working, especially death magic (i.e., magic isworked against someone who then dies). These are often referred to as antitherapy rituals (see the example in Chapter 4). Is there a physiological basis for such deaths? This issue isdiscussed by Harry D. Eastwell among the Australian Aborigines of Arnhem Land.11Eastwellnotes that the basis of such death by magic often is the result of an extreme state of fear. Suchfear gives rise to many symptoms, such as agitation, sleeplessness, and sweating. This is furtherexacerbated by the belief on the part of the victim and his or her family that death is inevitable.Thus as symptoms increase in intensity, the family withdraws support because the patient is seenas socially dead. Because the individual is socially dead, the family will not provide food andwater and will often begin funeral rituals before death has occurred.MAGIC IN SOCIETYMagic plays an important role in a society’s religious practices. We will examine the operation ofmagic in three societies, the Trobriand Islanders, the Azande, and the Fore. We will also look atthe role of magic in Wicca, a Neo-Pagan religion.Magic in the Trobriand IslandsThe Trobriand Islanders, who live off the western coast of New Guinea, distinguish among threetypes of knowledge. First there is knowledge of things in the everyday world, which is shared byall or a large group of adult members of the society. This is what a child learns from his or herparents and may be appropriate to one or the other gender. For example, boys might learn how togarden, and girls might learn how to weave mats. This is put to use in the everyday activities thatare a part of the normal pattern of living.A second form of knowledge is more specialized and is shared with a limited number ofindividuals. This includes expert knowledge that is necessary for task specializations, such assailing or woodcarving. This form also includes knowledge of particular magical rituals that tendto be learned by many members of the society.The highest level includes knowledge of the most complex and valued technological skills,such as canoe building, as well as knowledge of myths, songs, and dances. These skills areimportant to the community, and a person who has such skills is called tokabitam,“man withknowledge.” This level of knowledge includes knowledge of important magic, such as rain magicand garden magic. This knowledge is of great importance to the community, and the relativelyfew people who possess such knowledge are very important people, in terms of both prestige andwealth, because the services of such people are paid for.LEARNING MAGIC.Although many forms of magic are well known among adult members ofa community, much magical lore is the private property of individuals. The most common way toobtain magic is to learn it from one’s parents, grandparents, or other kin. Thus certain types ofmagic frequently are associated with particular family lines. Sometimes the magic is owned by"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination143a more remote relative or a nonrelative. In this case the person who desires the magic willpurchase it from its owner.A Trobriand Islander who wants to learn particular magic will present a series of giftsover time to the owner as a way of convincing the individual to bestow that knowledge. It is tothe advantage of the owner of the magic to spread the learning process over a long period oftime, thus maximizing the number of gifts given. If the owner dies before all of the magic hasbeen transferred to the student, the magic might not be effective because the transfer of themagic is incomplete.Sometimes the owner of the magic dies before beginning the transfer process or, for somereason, does not want to share the knowledge. This is how magic disappears from the community.For example, Malinowski, who studied the Trobriand Islanders between 1915 and 1918,provided details of particular garden magic (see Figure 7.1). This magic disappeared because itwas not passed on to the next generation. However, garden magic is very important, and influen-tial members of the community were able to purchase different garden magic from peoples living on islands to the south. Today many young men travel to the capital of Papua New Guineato find work. After several years they return, bringing gifts of manufactured goods as well asmagic that was purchased from tribes living on the large island. Examples of Trobriand Magiccan be found in Box 7.1.MAGICAL RITUAL.A key component of a magical act is the words that are spoken—the spell.The spell is often an oral text that is transmitted without change from generation to generation.The slightest deviation from its traditional form would invalidate the magic. Because spellsFIGURE 7.1Trobriand Island Garden Magic.A man named Tokunaya performs a magic ritual in a yam garden on the Trobriand Islands."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"144Chapter 7 • Magic and DivinationBOX 7.1Trobriand Island MagicBronislaw Malinowski described the role of magic in the building of a canoe among the TrobriandIslanders. The tree that is to become the canoe is found in the inland forest. The tree is cut down,and the bark is removed; men come out to pull the log from the forest to the village. Of course, itis a practical matter to make the log as light as possible, so the branches are removed, and the logis cut to the appropriate length.In addition, the proper magic is performed to further reduce the weight of the log. A piece ofdry banana leaf is put on top of the log. The builder beats the log with a bunch of dry lalanggrass andsays, “Come down, come down, defilement by contact with excrement! Come down, defilement bycontact with refuse! Come down, heaviness! Come down, rot! Come down, fungus!”aThe heavi-ness and slowness, due to all these magical causes, are drawn out of the log. This bunch of grass isthen ritually thrown away. This is the heavy bunch—it takes into it the heaviness of the log.Another bunch of lalanggrass, seared and dry, is beaten against the log. This is the lightbunch, which imparts lightness into the log and speed to the canoe. The builder says, “I lash you,O tree; the tree flies; the tree becomes like a breath of wind; the tree becomes like a butterfly; thetree becomes like a cotton seed fluff.”bMalinowski also described garden magic.cDespite all the knowledge, skills, and hard workthat are put into gardening, bad things can happen. Rain might fail to come, or insect pests mightdestroy a crop. To deal with these seemingly uncontrollable problems, the farmer turns to magic.In farming, good fertility and a good crop are attributed to the skill and knowledge of the farmerand the superiority of his magic. There is a clear distinction between work that must be performedmanually and work performed through magic. Together, they make up a complex gardening system.The Trobriand Islanders recognize many types of soils; they discriminate between manyvarieties of yams; they build fences to keep out pigs. “All these practical devices they handlerationally and according to sound empirical rules.”dThe islanders are very clear about what tasksare considered work and what are considered magic. The construction of a spirit house is strictlymagic, but weeding is work. Work and magic are essential to the success of a garden. Good luck,a better-than-expected result, is confirmation of the strength of the magic; bad luck, a poor crop,points out a deficiency in the magic.Malinowski describes many garden rituals. For example, this is part of a ritual that occursbefore a field is cleared of brush: In the morning the men gather together around the magician, areligious specialist, who fasts until the completion of the ritual. The men, dressed and bodiespainted for the special occasion, pick up their axes, which have been magically prepared. Theymarch to the garden, where the magician takes his hereditary wand of office in his left hand andhis axe in his right hand and enters the garden. He cuts a small sapling and recites a spell:eThis is our bad wood, O ancestral spirits! O bush-pig, who fightest, O bush-pig from the greatstone in the rayboag, O bush-pig of the garden stakes, O bush-pig drawn by evil smells, O bush-pig of the narrow face, O bush-pig of the ugly countenance, O fierce bush-pig. Thy sail, O bush-pig, is in thy ear, thy steering-oar is in thy tail. I kick thee from behind, I despatch thee. Goaway. Go to Ulawola. Return whence you have come. It burns your eyes, it turns your stomach.The sapling, which is then thrown into the forest, stands for evil influences and the bush-pig, which causes damage by digging up gardens. This ritual is followed by others, creatinga cycle of rituals that parallels the work that must be accomplished to secure a bountiful harvest."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination145aB.

In the Trobriand Islands theritual must be performed exactly. The slightest slip in the ritual, such as a minute omission inits performance or a seemingly insignificant change in its sequence, invalidates the magic. Thisis not the case in all societies. Among the Azande of the Sudan, described in the following,magical rituals are variable, and the spell is unformulated.Magical rituals usually contain material objects that are manipulated in set ways.Sometimes a special material or object is required for the magic to work; at other times familiarobjects are manipulated. Another aspect of ritual is the condition of the performer and the condi-tions of the ritual. Rituals can often be performed only at special places and at special times. Theperformer must often observe certain restrictions, such as abstention from sexual intercourse andavoidance of certain foods.Magic involves the direct manipulation of the supernatural. There is a sense of control. If oneperforms the ritual correctly, one will automatically obtain the desired result. The magician doesnot have to convince a deity to bring about the result. Magic compels the supernatural to bend to theperson’s wishes, and success is seen as inevitable (provided one knows the right formula). Otherreligious rituals assume that supernatural powers are free agents that might or might not grantrequests. (In many societies gods can be manipulated, bribed, or tricked but not controlled.)Magic among the AzandeOne of the most detailed studies of the religious system of a small-scale society is that of theAzande conducted by E. E. Evans-Pritchard in the 1920s and 1930s.12The Azande live in thesouthern Sudan, Congo culture area, which at the time Evans-Pritchard worked was a Britishcolony. Here we will examine Zande magic; later in this chapter we will look at Zande divina-tion. We will return to the Azande in Chapter 10 when we discuss witchcraft.Among the Azande, magic involves the use of objects, usually of plant material, calledmedicines.A medicine is an object in which supernatural power resides. To access this power,to change a piece of wood or plant material into medicine, requires ritual. The object, whichmay be consumed in the ritual or kept intact for long periods of time, then becomes the centerof magical rituals.There are large numbers of plants from which medicines are derived. Sometimes the associ-ation between the nature of the plant and its use is clearly based on the doctrine of signatures. Thisis recognized by the Azande, who point out that a particular plant is used because of its resem-blance to something that is associated with the purpose of the magic. A good example is aparticular fruit that is full of a milky sap. The fruit resembles the breast of a woman with a youngchild. A drink is made from the root of the plant and is given to a mother who is having difficultyproducing enough milk for her infant."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"146Chapter 7 • Magic and DivinationThe thousands of available medicines can be placed in a series of categories based on theirpurposes. There are those that control nature, such as rain. One is used to delay sunset so that theperson will have time to reach home before dark. Many medicines are associated with horticul-ture and hunting. For example, medicines are used to direct the flight of a spear or an arrow intothe prey and to protect the hunter from dangerous animals. Craftsmen, such as blacksmiths, havetheir own magic to aid in their task. Some medicines are used against witches and sorcerers.Magic is used to bring about success in love and to guarantee a safe journey. An important func-tion of magic is to avenge murder, theft, and adultery. Finally, diseases are cured by using specificmedicines.There are several ways in which the medicine is used. For example, plant material may beburned and, using oil, made into a paste that is then rubbed into incisions made on the face ortorso; or the medicine may be made into an infusion that is drunk. A man may make a whistle outof a particular variety of wood and keep this whistle tied around his waist. He blows it in themorning soon after waking up as a protection against misfortune. This very simple type of ritualis very common. But even more important rituals tend to be performed privately so that anenemy will not know that it is being performed and use other magic to interfere with the effectsof the ritual. In some cases a man might not want others to know that he owns a particular medi-cine. He does not want to be pestered by kin to perform the magic for them.Zande magic rites are not very formal, nor are they usually public. Although there aresome public rituals, such as war magic performed by a chief, most magic is performed by a sin-gle individual for his or her immediate need. There are a number of ritual actions that need to beperformed; yet the order of their performance will vary.The ritual itself is usually quite simple. It involves manipulating the medicine and recitinga spell. The spell is not formal. The individual simply addresses the medicine and tells it what heor she wants done. Unlike magical spells in other societies, power does not reside in the spell.Rather the power resides in the medicine, and the spell is simply a way of waking up the powerand giving the power instructions. The manner is quite informal; the only requirement is that theinstructions be clear. If the medicine is handled correctly and the instructions are clear, the magicwill work. Another requirement is the observation of a number of tabus, although which tabusare observed varies widely. Commonly, they include abstention from sexual activity and theavoidance of certain foods. If the tabu is not observed, the magic will fail.Whether or not a particular medicine is good or bad often depends on context. For exam-ple, magic that is worked to kill someone out of spite is bad. It is worked in secret in the dead ofnight. If a person who works bad magic is discovered, he or she will be killed. On the other hand,lethal magic that is legally sanctioned is good magic. This includes magic used to kill witchesand sorcerers. Sorcery also can be dealt with by counter-magic and antidotes.Sorcery among the ForeAlthough magic is used for a variety of reasons to increase the probability of success and controlthe uncertainties of life, magic can also be used in antisocial ways to interfere with the economicactivities of others and to bring about illness and even death.The Fore of New Guinea believe that the disease kuruis caused by sorcery (Chapter 1). The sor-cerer steals food remnants, hair, nail clippings, or excrement from the victim. He makes a bundle withleaves and some sorcerer’s stones and places the bundle in cold, muddy ground. He then beats the bun-dle with a stick and calls the victim’s name, reciting the following spell: “I break the bones of yourarms, I break the bones of your hands, I break the bones of your legs, and finally I make you die.”13"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination147The location of the bundle in cold, muddy ground suggests the deep chill felt by immobilized kurupatients. The use of something from the victim, such as hair, is an example of contagious magic. TheFore attempt to prevent kuruby attempting to deprive the sorcerer of the materials he needs. Much day-to-day behavior involves the hiding of hair clippings, parings, feces, and food scraps.The Fore recognize many diseases, some of which correspond to diseases recognized byWestern medicine. They are usually seen as the result of sorcery. Many magical techniques usematerials that were once in contact with the victim, as in kuru,but many use special poisons thatare placed where the victim will make contact with them, such as on a trail. In nankili,or pleurisy(a lung condition), the sorcerer makes bone needles out of the bones of pigs, cassowary, orpossums. He blows smoke on the bone needles to make the needles fly into the victim’s body.Wiccan MagicWicca is a Neo-Paganreligion, meaning that it is a perceived revival of pre-Christian religiouspractices (Chapter 11). Although there is great variation within the Wiccan religion, magic isoften a central element of ritual. Practitioners see their magical knowledge and rituals as a con-tinuation of thousands of years of folk magic, which was often lost or pushed underground by thespread of Christianity. Wiccans also borrow freely from the magic traditions of various culturesaround the world.The magic ritual usually consists of a stated goal, the manipulation of specific objects, andthe observation of special conditions, such as place and time. However, the core of the ritual,what is often considered the “real magic,” is movement of energy, which takes place within thepractitioner. The magician builds up this energy within herself or himself, and it is released at theright time to bring about the goal of the spell.Wiccan magic is based on the worldview that there is a power that exists in all things. Throughrituals (involving such things as music, dance, visualizations, and the manipulation of objects) thispower can be awakened and concentrated and can be set to effect a particular goal, which is thepurpose of the spell. The power can also be moved from one person to another or between humans,places, and objects. As this power moves to its intended target, it will have an effect on that target.Popular objects used in Wiccan spells include crystals, herbs, oils, candles, images, runes,and specific foods. The symbolism of color is also used, as are chanting and creative visualiza-tion. The religion is closely connected to nature, and the working of magic spells might require aconsideration of the weather, season, lunar phase, and/or time of day. The goal of such magic isoften very practical and meant to help with everyday challenges such as relationships, health,protection, money, and employment. Magic is to be used when all else fails and in conjunctionwith more mundane efforts. For example, the belief is that just doing magic to get a job will nothelp unless you also take practical measures, such as sending out resumes. Because each indi-vidual’s personal power is limited, it should not be used lightly.As we will see in Chapter 11, Wiccan moral rules are such that magic is to be used only forpositive purposes. Wiccans often say that they respect life, respect the earth, and respect thepower too much to do magic for evil.DIVINATIONIn the previous section we examined the subject of magic, techniques for directly and automaticallybringing about desired results through supernatural mechanisms. People use magic for a variety ofpurposes, such as bringing rain, curing illness, and ensuring fertility. Another way of dealing with"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"148Chapter 7 • Magic and Divinationthe uncertainties of life is to anticipate them. As the saying goes, “Knowledge is power.” If weonly knew what the future holds for us or what is happening at the present time in places andsituations that are hidden from us, decision making would certainly be easier. We could see theconsequences of our actions and learn about unknown variables that affect our lives.Techniques for obtaining information about things unknown, including events that willoccur in the future, is known as divination. The word divinationcomes from the same root as theword divinity.This implies that divination has to do with the supernatural.The nature of many forms of divination is magical. Such magical rituals are used to manipulatethe supernatural world in order to provide information. In other words, the ends of a magical ritualcan be a physical occurrence, such as the coming of rain, or information, such as who will win theSuper Bowl. Of course, supernatural beings—ancestors, spirits, and gods—also may have access tounknown information. Many divination techniques involve contact with such supernatural entities, aswhen a medium contacts the spirit of a deceased individual or when a shaman falls into a trance.Other forms of divination are based on the idea that the world consists of things and eventsthat are interconnected with one another. We saw this same worldview for the workings ofmagic. Magic is based on the manipulation of perceived connections between things; divinationis based on observing these connections. For example, many people believe that the movementsof the planets, sun, and moon are in some way ultimately connected with a person’s life and thatan understanding of these movements enables one to learn about the future. There is much infor-mation in nature, and those who are knowledgeable and observant often make accurate predic-tions. For example, a change in wind direction during a particular time of the day can foretell thecoming of rain. This is a very rational approach, one that leads to planning. But the relationshipbetween some signs is not obvious and, in fact, might not be a true relationship at all. The inter-pretation of such signs falls into the area of divination.Forms of DivinationThere are many ways of accomplishing an act of divination. To understand these methods better,we can classify various techniques into a number of categories.A basic characteristic of divination techniques is that some are inspirationaland othersare noninspirational. Inspirational forms of divination involve some type of spiritual experiencesuch as a direct contact with a supernatural being through an altered state of consciousness,usually possession. This form of divination is sometimes referred to as naturalor emotivedivination. Noninspirational or artificialforms are more magical ways of doing divination andinclude the reading of natural events as well as the manipulation of oracular devices. (The termoracleusually refers to a specific device that is used for divination and can refer to inspirationalor noninspirational forms. Examples are the poison oracle of the Azande, to be described in thefollowing, and a contemporary toy called the Magic 8 Ball.)We also can divide divination techniques into fortuitousand deliberatetypes.Fortuitous forms happen without any conscious effort on the part of the individual. One sees aflight of birds overhead or unexpectedly falls into a trance and has a vision. Deliberate formsare those that someone sets out to do, such as reading tarot cards or examining the liver of asacrificed animal.Using these two ways of classifying divination techniques, we can create four categories:fortuitous noninspirational, deliberate noninspirational, fortuitous inspirational, and deliberateinspirational, as shown in Table 7.1."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination149Divination TechniquesThere is a wide variety of divination methods. We will review a number of these, but, of course,this cannot be an exhaustive list.We will begin with dreams, which are a common form of divination. Dreams are oftenthought of as visits from spirits or visions of journeys taken by one’s soul during sleep. Either way,an individual establishes a connection with the supernatural world. All you have to do is to be ableto interpret what you experience in the dream. Much of the dream experience is symbolic, whichoften makes dreams difficult to interpret. Sometimes the interpretation is something you can do onyour own, but at other times it requires a specialist. The interpretation of dreams is termedoneiromancy.In American society you can purchase a book to help you interpret your dreams. One suchbook lists the following examples of the meanings associated with the presence of animals indreams.14Dreams of bats flying during the day are a sign of reassurance and calm, but batsflying during the night signify a problem. A bull is a sign of tough competition. Riding a horse isa sign of happiness, but a black horse signifies grief. Dreaming about monkeys is a warning thatyou are surrounded by lies and deceit. And so it goes for thousands of dream experiences that areinterpreted as signs telling of what is to be.TABLE 7.1A Classification of Methods of Divination with Examples to Be DescribedNoninspirationalInspirationalFortuitousApantomancyNecromancyOmensOneiromancyOrnithomancyPossessionPresentimentsDeliberateAleuromancyProphecyAstrologyMediumDowsingFlipping a coinGraphologyHaruspicationMagic 8 BallOrdealsOuija boardPalmistryPhrenologyScapulamancyTarot cardsTasseography"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"150Chapter 7 • Magic and DivinationThese interpretations of dream content are based on Euro-American dream symbolism.However, dreams may be interpreted differently in non-Euro-American cultures. Some scholarssee two basic categories of dreams. One is the individual dream, which is the type familiar to us,the kind that comes from inside of the dreamer. In some societies, however, the source of thedream may lie outside of the dreamer. These are the culturally patterned dreams that often aredeliberately sought—in a coming-of-age ritual, for example. Sometimes the individual simplywaits for the appropriate, culturally demanded dream to occur, often encouraged by a shaman orparent. Other dreams may be induced by fasting, isolation, and so forth.Whatever the source of the dreams, they often are a source of information, which classifiesthem as a divination method. Often an ancestor will appear in a dream and prescribe for thedreamer a cure for illness or a warning of what is to come. Guardian spirits and totems may letthemselves be known through dreams. Or a spirit may appear in a dream informing the individ-ual what his lot in life is, such as a call to a career as a shaman or priest. Or a dream may be avisit from the soul of a recently deceased relative informing the dreamer of a particular desire ofthe soul. Failure to meet this desire might result in illness and perhaps death.Presentimentsare feelings that a person experiences. They suggest that something is aboutto happen, such as a feeling of dread or an impending disaster. In some societies a warrior on araid will return to the camp or village on feeling a presentiment that is thought to be an omen ofhis impending death on the raid. The warrior will be thought of not as a coward, but as a prudentindividual.Body actions include such things as sneezing, twitching, and hiccupping. Such activitiescan be interpreted in many ways, and interpretations of the same action differ from culture toculture. Some American examples are as follows: If you sneeze before breakfast, you willreceive a letter that day. If you sneeze six times, you will go on a journey. If you hiccup or yourears are burning, someone is talking about you.The term necromancyis used in various ways. Generally, it refers to divination throughcontact with the dead or ancestors. In ancient Greek society, when a person died under suspi-cious circumstances, the body was brought into the temple for close examination. It wasbelieved that signs on the body were attempts of the spirit of the dead to communicate whathappened and who did it. In most cases a diviner enters a trance in an attempt to communicatewith the dead.Knowledge can be derived from the observation of living or dead animals. Thisincludes omens, fortuitous happenings or conditions that provide information. There are alarge number of examples as well as a very extensive vocabulary that describes them. Hereare only a few.One can gain information from the observed behavior of animals. Ornithomancyinvolvesreading the path and form of a flight of birds, and apantomancyrefers to a chance meeting withan animal, such as a black cat crossing one’s path. (Many cultures attribute good and bad fortuneto various animals that one comes upon. Among the Nandi of East Africa, if a rat crosses one’spath, that is good, but if it is a snake, that is bad.)An animal does not have to be alive to be used for divination, and it is sometimes asacrificed animal or part of an animal that is examined for answers to questions. Haruspication,the examination of the entrails of sacrificed animals, was part of the ceremonies opening asession of the Senate in ancient Rome. In another technique a scapula or shoulder blade from ananimal skeleton, such as a sheep, or even from a human skeleton is dried. Sometimes thequestion is written on the bone. The scapula is then placed in a fire, and the pattern of burns andcracks is read by a specialist to determine the response. This is called scapulamancy."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination151Many physical entities of the natural world are “read” for information. Astrologyis basedon the belief that all of the stars and planets, as well as the sun and moon, influence the destinyof people. Other techniques observe the winds and the movement of water. Infrequent appear-ances of natural events, such as earthquakes and comets, are said to portend evil events.There are many other forms of divination that are familiar to most Americans. Theseinclude aleuromancy, the use of flour (as in fortune cookies); dowsing, in which a forked stickis used to locate water underground; graphology, handwriting analysis; palmistry, the readingof the lines of the palm of the hand; phrenology, the study of the shape and structure of the head;and tasseography, the reading of tea leaves. Other familiar forms of divinations are mechanicaltypes that include the manipulation of objects (see Box 7.2). A good example is flipping a coin.Mechanical divination is the most common type in American society and includes the Ouijaboard, Magic 8 Ball, and tarot cards. Other types of mechanical devices are used in othersocieties. For example, in many divination systems a series of objects, such as shells and bones,are thrown and the pattern formed by these objects is read (Figure 7.2).FIGURE 7.2Divination.Divination is practiced in South Africa by throwing objects, including pieces of bone, on a mat."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"152Chapter 7 • Magic and DivinationINSPIRATIONAL FORMS.Inspirational divination is a form in which an individual has directcontact with a supernatural being, be it an ancestor, a ghost, a spirit, or a god. This is usuallyaccomplished through an altered state of consciousness. Possessioncan be either fortuitous ordeliberate. Prophecyis fortuitous in that the prophet receives information through a visionunexpectedly, without any necessary overt action on the part of the individual.BOX 7.2I Ching: The Book of ChangesThe I Ching,or The Book of Changes,is a Chinese divination text that is thousands of years old.The methods described provide much more than just yes/no answers and are seen not so much asforetelling the future, but rather as revealing what the person needs to do to live in harmony withthe forces of the universe that control the future.In Chapter 3 we discussed the concepts of yinand yang,the two interacting forces in theuniverse. Yinis the female element and is associated with coldness, darkness, softness, and theearth. Yangis the male element and is associated with warmth, light, hardness, and the heavens.The two elements are mutually dependent and need to be in equilibrium.In the I Ching, yangis represented by a single line (——–), and yinis represented by a brokenline (— —). A set of three lines produces eight patterns or trigrams. Each is named and is associatedwith nature: heaven, earth, fire, water, thunder, wind, mountain, and lake. In addition, each isassociated with a number of characteristics. For example, K’un, represented by three broken lines,is the earth and is associated with the color black and an animal (the cow). K’un is gentle, passive,and nurturing. Two sets of trigrams are then put together to form each of the sixty-four hexagrams.There are many techniques of casting a hexagram. Some methods are quite complicatedand involve much ritual. One commonly used method involves the throwing of three coins. Theoutcomes of six throws identify the six lines in the hexagram. A more elaborate method of castingthe hexagram is to use a set of yarrow stalks.Each hexagram can be read on several levels. First, each of the six lines, which can be yinoryang,has meaning. Second, one can examine the pair of trigrams. However, most important arethe meanings assigned to each of the sixty-four hexagrams.In some techniques of casting, there are four types of lines: old yin, young yin, old yang, andyoung yang. Old yinand old yangare changing lines. The original hexagram is used to provide insightinto the present; when the changing lines change to the opposite form, information is provided aboutthe future. Thus if the top two lines are old yin, they will change into yangcreating a second hexagram.As examples, here are brief descriptions of three hexagrams. The hexagram that is com-posed of six solid lines (yang) is named Heaven. “This hexagram is a good omen for an importantoccasion of state, an imperial sacrificial rite.” The hexagram named Small Castle is composed offive solid lines and one broken line third from the top. “The image of heavy clouds promising rainthat has not yet arrived conveys a mood of expectation and anxiety. There is a sense of impendingstorm.” Finally, the hexagram named Peace consists of three broken lines on top and three solidlines at the bottom. “Some small sacrifices may be called for in order to attain your larger goal.Generally favorable.”Source:K. Huang and R. Huang, I Ching(New York: Workman, 1987)."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination153A familiar example of prophecy is Moses. The book of Exodus tells that Moses wastending his father-in-law’s flock and one day led them to the edge of the desert. An angel of Godappeared to Moses from within a burning bush. God told Moses to lead the Israelites out ofEgypt, but Moses at first did not want to go. He replied, “Who am I, that I should go to pharaoh,and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” God replied, “I will be with you”(Exodus 3).Deliberate possession involves an overt action whereby the individual falls into a trance.Such people would be called mediums. Communication from the deities through possession,usually of a priest, is a very common feature of many religious systems. One example is theOracle at Delphi, discussed later in this chapter.ORDEALS.Ordealsare painful and often life-threatening tests that a person who is suspectedof guilt may be forced to undergo, such as dipping a hand into hot oil, swallowing poison, orhaving a red-hot knife blade pressed against some part of the body. Ordeals can be thought of asa trial by divination performed on the body of the accused. In some cultures, including pastEuropean and American cultures, ordeals were an important part of criminal trials.Among the Kpelle of Liberia, trials are conducted through the use of the hot knife ordeal.The ordeal is conducted by a specialist, who is licensed by the government. The specialist willheat a knife in a fire and first pass the knife over his own body to show that the ordeal is validbecause he himself is not burned. Then the knife is stroked over the body of the accused. If theindividual is burned, he is guilty.Ordeals can rely on the idea, as in Christian Europe, that an ordeal reflected the judgmentof God, who would punish the guilty and save the innocent. In most cases it seems that the factof guilt or innocence itself acted in some magical way to affect the ordeal. For example, in a trialby fire, only the guilty would be burned.It might appear that in ordeals it is the guilty who suffers, but this is not always the case.In trial by water it is the innocent who runs the risk. The idea is that the pure element of waterwould reject the impure, being happy to accept and drown an innocent person but casting upand rejecting an impure body such as that of a witch or a criminal. This was extensively usedagainst accused witches. The accused was tied up and tossed into the water. She had a rope onher with a mark at a certain length. If she sank to this point, she was innocent. She would bepulled up and turned loose—if she could be resuscitated. A medieval text reads:15Consecration to Be Said over the Man. May omnipotent God, who did order baptismto be made by water, and did grant remission of sins to men through baptism: mayHe, through His mercy, decree a right judgment through that water. If, namely, thouart guilty in that matter, may the water which received thee in baptism not receivethee now; if however, thou art innocent, may the water which received thee inbaptism receive thee now. Through Christ our Lord.Fore DivinationWe have already discussed the Fore of New Guinea and the effects of the disease kuruin theirlives (see Chapter 1). The Fore believe that sorcery is the cause of the disease. Therefore anessential element in dealing with kuruis the identification of the sorcerer. The most commondivination technique uses a possum as a vehicle for supernatural revelation. The victim’shusband, brothers, and husband’s age mates place some of the victim’s hair clippings in onesmall bamboo tube. In another tube they insert the body of a freshly killed possum. Striking one"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"154Chapter 7 • Magic and Divinationbamboo against the other, they call the name of the supposed sorcerer and then place the bamboocontaining the animal in the fire. The guilt of the accused is established if the possum’s liver,the locus of its consciousness, remains uncooked. After divination they do not openly accuse aspecific person of sorcery, but the suspected sorcerer is subjected to further tests or death magic.The Fore also consult healers, who usually belong to distant communities and even non-Fore groups. These “dream men,” whom we would label mediums, enter altered states ofconsciousness through the rapid inhaling of tobacco and the use of other plant materials thatproduce trances and hallucinations. Information is also gleaned from dreams. Such diviners arethen able to identify sorcerers.Oracles of the AzandeZande oracles have been described in great detail by Evans-Pritchard. The best known are iwa,the rubbing-board oracle; dakpa,the termite oracle; and benge,the poison oracle.The oracle that is most often used is iwa,or the rubbing-board oracle. This is a relativelyinexpensive and easy-to-use oracle that can be consulted very quickly. There are many situationsin which some answer is urgently needed, such as the sudden onset of an illness, decisions aboutgoing on a journey, questions about interpersonal relationships, and a myriad of minor questions.Many older men carry iwaon their persons, ready to consult it at a moment’s notice. If a man hasnot acquired or learned to use the oracle, it is quite easy to find a friend or relative who has.The rubbing-board oracle takes many shapes, but it is relatively small and is always madeof wood with a flat, round or oval “female” surface and a “male” piece or lid that fits on top.After being carved, the object becomes an oracle only after it has been rubbed with medicinesand buried in the ground for a few days to permit the medicines to work. The female surface istreated with plant juices, and the male lid is moistened with water. As the lid is moved back andforth, it will either move smoothly or stick to the female surface. The sticking is usually inter-preted as a yes answer; moving smoothly is interpreted as a no answer.Iwais manufactured and used by humans and therefore is thought to be prone to error.Although it is sometimes inaccurate, this fact is balanced against the ease of use and the fact thata large number of questions can be asked of this oracle within a very short period of time. It oftenserves as the first step in the process that leads to the use of more reliable, albeit more expensiveand complex, oracles.A greater level of reliability is given by dakpa,the termite oracle. Just about any man, and some-times a woman, can consult dakpa.All one has to do is to find a termite mound and then take twobranches from two different trees and place them into the mound. The next day one removes the two tosee which one (or both) has been eaten by the termites. Of course, the process is slow—one has to waitovernight—and because only a few questions can be asked at any one time, its use is quite limited.However, it is considered to be reliable, primarily because it is not manufactured by humans, the agentsof the oracle being termites that are not influenced by the same things that influence a person.Without question the most important Zande oracle is benge.When it is consulted or sanc-tioned by a chief, the results may be used as evidence in legal proceedings. It is used in all impor-tant legal and social situations and directs the Azande on what to do in major crisis situations.The poison used is a red powder manufactured from a forest creeper and mixed with waterto become a paste. The liquid is squeezed out of the paste into the beaks of small chickens, whichare compelled to swallow it. Generally violent spasms follow. The doses sometimes prove fatal,but just as often the chickens recover, and sometimes they are even completely unaffected by thepoison. From the behavior of the chickens, especially by their death or survival, Azande receiveanswers to the questions they place before the oracle."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination155The creeper does not grow in Zandeland. It takes a long, difficult journey through the terri-tory of other tribes to procure the poison. This, in part, accounts for the high value the Azandeplace on the poison oracle. The oracular consultation takes place away from the homesteadswhere the oracle can be consulted in secrecy without interference from witches. The equipmentincludes the poison and a basket of chickens. The Azande raise chickens but do not regularlyslaughter them for food except on very special occasions. Eggs are not consumed but are permit-ted to hatch.It takes experience and skill to become a good operator of the oracle, to judge the amount ofpoison to be given the chickens, and to observe and interpret the behavior of the chickens. At thestart of a consultation the operator, who has observed a number of tabus, prepares the poison. A second man will pose the questions. The operator twirls a grass brush in the liquid poison andsqueezes the brush so that the poison runs into the throat of the chicken. Then the questioner beginsto address the poison for several minutes, and more poison is given to the chicken. Then the opera-tor takes the chicken in his hand, jerks it back and forth, and finally places it on the ground. Theoperator and questioner watch as the animal dies or survives. Depending on the way in whichthe question was phrased and the instructions that are given to the poison, the death or survival ofthe chicken provides a yes/no answer to the question. We will discuss bengefurther when wediscuss Zande witchcraft in Chapter 10, because the poison oracle is the principle method of deter-mining the identity of a witch.Divination in Ancient Greece: The Oracle at DelphiMany divination techniques were popular in ancient Greece including oneiromancy (interpreta-tion of dreams), ornithomancy (reading the flight of birds), haruspication (examining the entrailsof dead animals), cleromancy(casting lots), and the consultation of professional mediums, suchas those at Siwah, Didyma, Dodona, and Delphi.The Temple of Apollo at Delphi was the most important religious site in ancient Greece.The site dates back to 1400 B.C.E. and was built around a sacred spring. The Greeks consideredDelphi to be the center (literally the navel) of the world. The oracle at Delphi was consulted formany matters, large and small, by people from all over Greece and beyond. Battles to be fought,voyages to be undertaken, investments to be made were all brought before the oracle, whoseanswers were often cryptic. It was the oracle at Delphi that warned Oedipus in myth that hewould kill his father and marry his mother.The oracle spoke the word of the god Apollo through the Pythia, a woman who would enteran altered state of consciousness and become possessed by Apollo. Many ancient accounts exist thatdescribe how this divination took place. A person wishing to consult the oracle would first sacrificean animal and observe whether or not it was a good day to consult the oracle. If the omens weregood, the petitioner would wait outside the Adyton, the inner chamber only entered by the Pythia.Prior to actual consultation with the god Apollo, the Pythia would cleanse herself in thespring, drink water from another sacred spring, and chew on a laurel leaf (a symbol of Apollo).She would seat herself on a tripod which was located over a chasm in the earth (Figure 7.3).Inhaling a pneuma, or sweet-smelling gas, which came from the chasm, she would enter into analtered state of consciousness. Questions, written on lead tablets, were passed in to the Pythia andshe would answer. A priest or poet located nearby would then interpret what she had said andrecord it in verse.Scholars disagree on how incoherent or how lucid the Pythia’s speech was and howmuch interpreting was done by the priest. Regardless, her answers, in the way of oracles, werenot direct. They were often ambiguous, filled with double meanings, or plainly misleading."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"156Chapter 7 • Magic and DivinationFor example, the story is told of King Croesus of Lydia, who asked the Pythia if he shouldmake war on the Persians. She answered that if he did, he would destroy a great realm.Croesus went to war, not realizing that the realm he would destroy would be his own.Although descriptions from Plutarch and others had described the Pythia breathing ingases from the chasm, attempts in the early 1900s to find an actual source of these gases failed.For many years the idea that such a thing had actually taken place was dismissed. Then in the1980s, a United Nations Development Project began a survey in Greece of active faults. At thattime a geologist, Jelle de Boer, found signs that indicated a fault line running along the southslope of Mount Parnassus and under the site of the oracle.16Gases and spring water could havereached the surface through cracks created by the fault in the ground below the temple. De Boerbegan working with an interdisciplinary team including an archaeologist, a chemist, and atoxicologist. This team has suggested that inhaling the gas ethylene could account for the variousdescriptions of the effects on the Pythia of inhaling the pneuma at Delphi.AstrologyQuite likely the most popular divination technique practiced in the United States today is astrol-ogy that has a history stretching back thousands of years. The basis of astrology is the assump-tion of a causal relationship between celestial phenomena and terrestrial ones and the influencethat the stars and planets have on the lives of human beings. Astrology can be used to examinethe life of a specific individual or to divine events of importance to the whole community.FIGURE 7.3Painting of the Pythia.Painting on a drinking cup, ca.440–430 B.C.E.

This is the only contemporary image of the Pythia."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination157The origins of astrology appear to have been in Babylonia, where it was the most commonform of divination. However it was not conducted on an individual basis, but rather for the well-being of the entire community. The casting of horoscopes did not occur until the fifth centuryB.C.E., rather late in the history of Babylonian astrology. Other important innovations includeddividing the ecliptic of the sun’s orbit around the earth into twelve zones of thirty degrees each.Crucial to Babylonian astrology was the idea that the movements of the celestial bodiesrepresented the will of the gods. Therefore, by reading the signs in the heavens, the future couldbe divined. The sky was seen as containing the “mansions” of the three principal gods: Anu,Enlil, and Ea. These gods governed the “celestial paths” or three belts that ran along the equator,the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. Each of the planets was also identified with aspecific deity. For example, the planet Jupiter was associated with Marduk, and Venus was asso-ciated with the goddess Ishtar. Ultimately, a god was linked to, and was seen to rule over, eachmonth. Importantly, this was closely linked with the activities of the agricultural cycle.From Babylonia, astrology spread to Greece, Rome, and Egypt, where it was developed farbeyond what the Babylonians had achieved. Hipparchus is credited with discovering the positionof the equinoxes around 130 B.C.E., thus laying the foundation for the horoscope as we now know it.One of the most significant contributions to astrology on the part of the Greeks is this attempt tochart an individual’s destiny by looking at the position of the stars and planets. From the Greekswe also get the fully developed zodiac. Each of the twelve zones was linked to a particularanimal (e.g., Saturn with a goat, Mars with a ram, Venus with a bull). From Greece astrologyspread to India and Iran and throughout much of Asia.In Europe, Greek astrological knowledge was revived only with the translation of Arabic textsin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. There was a large renewal of interest in the subject in WesternEurope during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Up until the rise of modern science in thesixteenth century, astrology and astronomy were intertwined. With the discoveries of Copernicus,Galileo, and Kepler, astrology lost any scientific basis and became separate from astronomy.Astrology is extremely popular in the United States today. Even people who do not believein its divinatory abilities generally still know what their sign is and at least a little of what isassociated with that sign. For example, both of the authors of this book are Geminis, one born inlate May and the other in early June, albeit a generation apart. Gemini is ruled by Mercury andsymbolized by the twins. The twin symbolism is supposed to relate to the dual, creative, versatile,and complex nature of those born under this sign. Less flattering descriptions include unpre-dictable, restless, and confusing to others. Gemini is also considered to be a masculine, outer-directed, and active sign. One of three air signs, Gemini is associated with being free-thinking,intellectual, and communicative. Of course, an individual horoscope could be done for each of usthat would also take into account the specific day and time of our respective births.However, the description of a person born under the sign of Gemini applies to millions ofpeople on Earth—one-twelfth of all humankind. The characteristics are broad and general.Sometimes a particular element describes a person very well—in which case we are impressed—while other elements do not—in which case we either ignore it or reinterpret the element in such away that does fit.CONCLUSIONIn Chapter 1 we saw that the human brain extends the theory of mind into the minds of animalsand other living and nonliving entities. The human mind sees intension in the nonhuman worldand the ability to directly interact with it. This gives rise to the seeming ability to directly"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158Chapter 7 • Magic and Divinationinfluence and, to some degree, control the nonhuman world through ritual activity. This is thebasis of magical thinking.Although magic at first appears to be an exotic topic, practiced by those in foreign places,in reality magical thinking is a very human way of thinking and is practiced at some time oranother by every one of us. The logic of magic not only is the result of our normal mentalprocesses, but also answers our need to have some control over our lives. Magic gives us controland divination gives us knowledge—two of the major functions of religion.However, there is a negative side to the use of magic and divination. It can give us a senseof control where control does not exist. This can have negative consequences as when the habit-ual gambler believes that he can control the roll of the dice by addressing the dice or holdingthem in a particular way. Likewise, many faithfully read their daily horoscope and use the read-ings to guide important decisions in their lives. While the use of astrology and other divinationtechniques may be branded as harmless entertainment, they can easily take the place of critical,reasoned thought and analysis.Magic deals with supernatural forces and thus is a religious phenomenon. In the next twochapters we will turn to what may be a more familiar domain of religion: anthropomorphicsupernatural beings.SummaryMagic refers to activities by which a person cancompel the supernatural to behave in certain ways.Key components of magical acts are the words thatare spoken or the spell and objects that are manip-ulated in set ways. Magical rituals usually can beperformed only at special places and at specialtimes. The performer must often observe certainrestrictions such as abstention from sexual inter-course and avoidance of certain foods. A magicianis usually a worker in the kind of magic that is onthe whole public and good, whereas a sorcererdeals in matters that are evil and antisocial.Frazer articulated the Law of Sympathy,which states that magic depends on the apparentassociation or agreement between things. Thereare two parts to the Law of Sympathy. The first isthe Law of Similarity, which states that thingsthat are alike are the same. The second is the Lawof Contagion, which states that things that wereonce in contact continue to be connected after theconnection is severed. The Law of Similaritygives rise to homeopathic or imitative magic, andthe Law of Contagion to contagious magic.Tylor addressed the question of whypeople believe that magic works. The answer isbecause magic appears to never fail. There areseveral reasons for this. Because magic alwaysworks, failure must be due to the inadequaciesof the magician. Magic usually attempts tobring about events that will naturally occur;people do not generally ask impossible things ofmagic. Finally, there is the issue of selectivememory.Techniques for obtaining information aboutthings unknown, including events that will occurin the future, is known as divination. Inspirationalforms of divination involve some type of spiri-tual experience, such as a direct contact with asupernatural being through an altered state ofconsciousness. Noninspirational forms are moremagical ways of doing divination and include thereading of natural events as well as the manipula-tion of oracular devices. Fortuitous forms simplyhappen without any conscious effort on the partof the individual; deliberate forms are thosethat someone sets out to do. Examples of divi-nation include omens, presentiments, possession,prophecy, ornithomancy, oneiromancy, necromancy,astrology, dowsing, flipping a coin, ordeals, palmistry, phrenology, and reading tarot cards."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 • Magic and Divination159Suggested ReadingsWilliam J.

Althoughthe spiritual nature of living things can be thought of as a generalized supernatural power,it is seen most frequently as supernatural beings of various kinds. Some supernatural beings livewithin animals, plants, and natural physical features; others live as independent beings. Somesupernatural entities are closely associated with humans, being human in origin; others, like godsand spirits, are usually separate from humans in origin.This chapter will study supernatural beings that are thought to be the supernatural mirrorof animate beings, primarily humans, or are transformed human beings. Important amongthese are soul and ghosts, which are supernatural manifestations of individuals living and dead.We will conclude with an examination of death rituals that frequently interface with thesupernatural entities that are discussed in this chapter.SOULS AND ANCESTORSThe belief in the existence of a spirit entity residing within a person appears to be a natural onethat grows out of simple observations about life. A human being does certain things, interactswith people in certain ways, and has a distinct personality. On the other hand, a person tempo-rarily ceases to be an active being during sleep or when in a faint or coma; during sleep a persondreams; during ritual a person enters a trance. A person permanently ceases to be an animatedbeing in death. What is responsible for all this?The term soulis used to label the noncorporeal, spiritual component of an individual.Although many people are familiar with the presence of spirits within nonhuman animals, mostscholars reserve the term soulfor the spirits that inhabit the human body. Usually, each indi-vidual possesses a soul that takes on the personality of the individual (or perhaps the individualtakes on the personality of the soul). The soul usually has an existence after death, at least forsome period of time.When one dreams, it is as if one’s soul leaves the body and travels rapidly through spaceand time. It meets up with all sorts of people, including the souls of relatives who have died. Insome groups it is considered dangerous to wake someone up suddenly, for there might not beenough time for the soul to return from its travels, and the soul might be lost. On the other hand,8"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"162Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Deathit is not a good idea to murder someone in his or her sleep because the person’s soul is absent. Itis better to wait until the victim is awake and the soul has returned.We see a person sleeping, lying inert, devoid of activity and personality. We make thesame observation when one faints or goes into a coma. Some believe that when a shamanenters a trance, the shaman’s soul has left the shaman’s body to travel to a supernaturalworld. Illness may be caused by the soul having left the body. Death is the permanentwithdrawal of the soul from the body. The existence of a soul that survives death isreinforced when a loved one feels the presence of the deceased or experiences visits fromthe deceased in dreams.Variation in the Concept of the SoulAlthough the concept of a soul can be found in all cultures, the soul takes on a great many forms.The soul may be envisioned as a full-sized duplicate of the living individual, or it may be smalland reside somewhere in the body. Where? Perhaps in the liver, the chest, the heart, or the brain.The soul may exist as a person’s shadow, so one must be careful where one’s shadow falls. Or thesoul may be reflected in a mirror, which is why beings without souls, such as vampires, have noreflection. When seeing a photograph for the first time, some people see the image as the soulthat has been captured by the photographer.Many people think of different kinds of souls that reside within the body. One soul mightbe responsible for a person’s animation and will disappear at death. This soul, or life force, maybe reincarnated into other living beings. Another soul might be a spirit that is that individual’spersonality. Different souls may be associated with different parts of the body, or one soul maycome from the father’s family and another from the mother’s.For example, in Haitian Vodou, there are three spiritual components associated with thephysical being. One of these is a spirit known as the mét-tét,or “Master of the Head.” Its identity is discovered through divination. The mét-tétmay possess the individual. The other twospiritual components can be seen as souls. The ti-bonanj,or “little angel,” is a person’sconsciousness and ego. When the body dies, the ti-bonanjstays nearby for a while and thenmoves on to heaven, where it has little more to do with the living. The gwo-bonanj,or “bigangel,” comes from the ancestral spirits and is returned after death. It is a part of Bondye, the“High God,” and is a person’s life force that determines, in part, his or her character andintelligence. If a person has lived a good life, the person’s memory will be kept for manygenerations, and his or her gwo-bonanjmay be prayed to.You may be born with souls, but other souls may be acquired during your lifetime. TheJivaro of Ecuador (Amazon culture area) believe that a person has three souls. Every person isborn with a nekas,or the soul that is the life force. The second soul, the aruntam,has to beacquired through a vision. The Jivaro see this life as false and the spiritual world as real. Onlyby acquiring an aruntamcan a person enter into the real, spiritual world. Acquiring this soul isalso believed to give a person power, intelligence, and self-confidence. The third soul, themiusak,is the “avenging soul.” If a person’s aruntamis killed, the miusakwill avenge thedeath. It is this belief that gives rise to the practice of headhunting. The miusakis believed toreside in the head; capturing and ritually shrinking the head are believed to neutralize it.In some cultures the soul is created anew for each child. Beliefs differ as to when and howthe soul enters into the child. For example, the Roman Catholic belief that the soul enters thechild at conception has influenced their position on such issues as cloning and abortion. In othercultures the soul may have a previous existence before it starts a new life."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death163Souls, Death, and the AfterlifeThe concept of a soul is very closely tied to ideas about death. As Nigel Barley writes, “notionsof what it means to be dead are always part of a more general idea of what it means to be a livinghuman being in the first place and funerary behaviour and beliefs around the world read like anextended discussion of the notion of the person.”1As far as anthropologists are aware, there are no cultures that do not have a soul-like con-cept and no cultures that do not believe that this soul survives the death of the body, at least forsome period of time. Where there is a belief in multiple souls, the different souls may have dif-ferent destinations after death, including surviving for different lengths of time. In most culturesthe idea of the soul after death is based more on continuity with life than with immortality, as iscommon in the West.Souls that live after death may spend some time near their family, often until the funeral iscompleted, and then may travel someplace else or be reincarnated. One of the functions of funer-al rituals is to aid the soul in its journey. Sometimes these journeys are dangerous and difficult,and a soul might perish on the journey or might end up in a not-so-nice place. In some religioussystems the duration of a soul’s residence after death is finite, and the soul is reborn in anotherindividual or, in the case of transmigration, into the body of an animal.The ability of a soul to survive its journey to the land of the dead may depend on the qual-ity of the person’s life. In such societies the life is judged, and the threat of failing to “pass thetest” to enter paradise can act as a means of social control. On the other hand, in many groups allsouls make it to wherever souls go after death, or only those who have memorized particularrituals or who have had elaborate funeral rituals. It is not always the good that successfully makethe journey; often it is the wealthy and powerful.Where is the land of the dead, and what is it like? The final destination of the soul is usuallyat some distance from the place where the person lived. It is often located at a known geographicplace, such as a mountaintop or island, or a place that is “over the horizon.” Often it is located in aplace that is not considered a part of the normal physical world, such as in the sky or underground.Although we in the West tend to think of the physical afterlife as a paradise, in many cultures it issurprisingly similar to the physical community on earth. In the afterlife the dead socialize, hunt, andhave sex. However, there is no illness, and the dead interact with their ancestors.Not all souls go to the same afterlife. Many people have special places for souls dependingon certain attributes. For example, warriors who have died in battle, women who have died inchildbirth, or persons who have died by suicide might go to special places. There may be specialplaces for the souls of certain social classes or occupational groups, such as shamans. For exam-ple, Valhalla was the special place for Viking warriors who died a good death, that is, died in bat-tle. In this case both social status and manner of death were important.Examples of Concepts of the SoulIn this section we will examine soul beliefs in several societies, including the Yup’ik of Alaska,the Yanomamö of South America, and the Hmong of Southeast Asia, as well as Roman Catholic,Hindu, and Buddhist beliefs.YUP’IK SOULS.Many religious systems believe in the recycling of souls. Among the Yup’ik ofwestern Alaska, a newborn has the soul of someone who has recently died in the grandparentalgeneration, after whom the child is named. After death, the soul remains nearby for a period of"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"164Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Deathtime and then leaves to await rebirth. Thus the immortal soul recycles through time from thebeginning of the earth.In Yup’ik culture, animals also possess immortal souls that are a part of a cycle ofbirth and rebirth. However, this cycle is based on a reciprocal relationship between humansand animals that is based on how each treats the other. For example, if a seal perceives thatthe hunter is adhering to the rules of Yup’ik society and its relationship to the animalworld, the seal will permit itself to be killed. Its flesh will provide food for the hunter andhis family, and the seal’s soul will, if treated properly by the hunter, return to the sea to bereborn again.BOX 8.1How Do You Get to Heaven?The majority of Americans believe there is a heaven (81 percent according to a 2007 Gallup poll).aPerhaps the more interesting questions is how they think one gets to heaven and whether or notthey believe that their path is the only one. The main divide in opinions on how one gets to heav-en is the works versus grace debate. On the works side is a belief that it is one’s actions or deedsthat allow one to get into heaven. Of course, the question remains of just which deeds and howmany need to be performed. In the late fifteenth century, an emphasis on deeds as the path tosalvation led to the selling of indulgences by the Catholic Church, which was one of the majorissues in the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther and others reacted to the idea that one couldbuy one’s way into heaven by proposing the alternative grace argument that it is only throughbelief in God that one enters heaven. The belief position also has its issues, mainly concerned withethics and personal responsibility. Is a last-minute acceptance of God enough to make up for anyact, no matter how heinous? When the Pew Research Center asked respondents which theybelieved, it was fairly evenly divided with a third citing actions and another third citing belief. Theresponses varied somewhat along religious lines with evangelicals more likely to cite belief andCatholics more likely to cite acts.Another question asked by the Pew survey was whether the person believed that his or herpath was the only path to heaven.bA surprising majority (70 percent, including 56 percent of evan-gelicals) stated that there are other paths. Of the 65 percent of Christians who held this belief, most(80 percent) included at least one non-Christian religion in their answer. There was an associationbetween how a person answered the faith versus acts question and whether they felt theirs wasthe only path. For example, those who believe faith is crucial were less likely to see other valid pathsto heaven.While the majority of Christians surveyed said other paths could lead to heaven, the numberwho did so has decreased since earlier surveys in 2002 and 2007. White evangelical Protestantsand black Protestants in particular have become noticeably more strict on this question.aJune 13, 2007, “Americans More Likely to Believe in God Than the Devil, Heaven More Than Hell,” by FrankNewport (http://www.gallup.com/poll/27877/Americans-More-Likely-Believe-God-Than-Devil-Heaven-More-Than-Hell.aspx).b“Many Americans Say Other Faiths Can Lead to Eternal Life,” December 18, 2008(http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1062/many-americans-say-other-faiths-can-lead-to-eternal-life.)"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death165On death, the soul of the seal retracts to its bladder. The Yup’ik collect all of the bladdersfrom the seals killed during the year. They are inflated and hung throughout a five-day festivaland then are shoved through a hole in the ice into the water, where the souls are eventually reborn.YANOMAMÖ SPIRITS AND SOULS.The Yanomamö (Tropical Forest culture area) believe in acomplex of souls. The main part of the soul becomes a no boreböat death. The Yanomamöcosmos is composed of four layers. The living Yanomamö live on the third layer, and on deaththe no borebömoves up to the second layer, where it moves down a trail until it encounters aspirit named Wadawadariwä. The spirit asks the soul whether it has been stingy or generous. Ifthe soul replies that it has been stingy, it is sent to a place of fire, but if it has been generous, itjoins the ancestors. One would assume that the possibility of being sent to a place of firewould act as a constraint on negative behavior during life, but Wadawadariwä is thought to besomewhat stupid and will accept what the soul tells him, which is why everyone is generous andis sent to the village of the ancestors.Another aspect of the soul is the bore,which is released during cremation. It remains onearth and lives in the jungle. Some borepossess bright glowing eyes and will attack people whoare traveling through the jungle at night.The third aspect of the soul is the möamo,which lies within the body near the liver.Shamans will use their powers to remove the möamofrom the body of their enemies, who willbecome sick and die. Much of the activity of shamans is divided between stealing the souls ofenemies and recovering the souls of members of their own community.In addition, everyone has a nonoshi,or animal, which is born each time a human child isborn and will develop and grow along with the child. The animal is the person’s double, and whathappens to one will happen to the other. When either the person or his or her nonoshidies, theother dies. The most common nonoshifor males are large birds, and for females are land animals.A person’s nonoshilives far away. Therefore a person has no physical contact with his orher own nonoshi. Still it is possible for someone else living where the nonoshilives to kill thenonoshi,usually by accident, then the person associated with it dies. If possible, the dead per-son’s relatives will seek vengeance by killing the murderer. Every once in a while, hunters willencounter an animal that shows unusual behavior. Such an animal is either an evil spirit or some-one’s nonoshi.It is never killed.HMONG SOULS.The Hmong are a people living in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.Large numbers of Hmong from Laos immigrated to the United States after the end of theVietnam War.The Hmong believe that a person possesses a number of souls—some sources say as manyas thirty. Health is the result of a balance between the physical body and its souls. When one ormore of the souls are lost or stolen, the person falls ill.A soul may be frightened out of the body by a traumatic event, or it may be stolen by aspirit. Anne Fadiman, in her book The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,tells the story of aHmong family living in Merced, California.2The story centers on a little girl, Lia. One day Lia’ssister came into the house and slammed the door, frightening Lia’s soul out of her body. The lossof the soul resulted in an illness, which the Hmong call by a phrase that translates as “the spiritcatches you and you fall down.” The spirit being referred to is a soul-stealing spirit. This illnessis diagnosed as epilepsy in Western medicine.Curing such illnesses falls to the shaman. The shaman enters an altered state of conscious-ness to search for the lost soul and, if it is found, will return it to the patient’s body. If the soul"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"166Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Deathwas stolen by a spirit, the shaman will negotiate with the spirit for the return of the soul. Giftswill be offered, and the soul of a sacrificed animal will be offered in exchange for the soul of thesick individual.After the birth of a child its placenta (afterbirth) is buried under the dirt floor of the house.The word used by the Hmong for the placenta can be translated as “jacket,” and it is thought ofas a piece of clothing. At death the soul travels back to the place where the person’s placenta wasburied and puts on its placenta jacket. This allows the soul to travel on the dangerous path to theplace where the ancestors live. If the soul fails to locate its placenta jacket, it will wander foreternity, never to be reunited with its ancestors.THE SOUL IN ROMAN CATHOLICISM.The doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church states thatafter death the destiny of each soul is determined by God, based primarily on the person’s behav-ior during life. The main issue is the presence of sin, which is defined as a moral evil. People whoare free of sin and are perfectly pure will go to Heaven, where they will be with God and willexperience perfect happiness. Although God is considered to be omnipresent, Heaven is consid-ered to be His home; in general it is conceived of as being in the sky.Souls that are in a state of grace but in need of purification go to Purgatory. The wordPurgatorycomes from the Latin purgare,meaning to make clean or to purify. Purgatory existsfor those souls who die with lesser faults for which the person had not repented or for which thepenalty was not entirely paid during life. For example, venial sins are considered a consequenceof human frailty and are considered pardonable, requiring only temporary punishment. Thesesins can be dealt with by time spent in Purgatory. This is necessary because nothing less than theperfectly pure can enter Heaven.People who die in mortal sin or with original sin are relegated to eternal punishment inHell. A mortal sin is an act that is contrary to Divine law and separates the sinner from God;original sin is the sin of Adam in Genesis, which is washed away by baptism. Hell is a place ofpunishment and eternal torment for the damned, including both humans and demons. Hell isusually conceived of as being within the earth. In the Bible it is described as an abyss and a placeto which the wicked descend. Because its inhabitants are estranged from God, they are placed asfar away from Him as possible.THE SOUL IN HINDUISM AND BUDDHISM.In Hinduism there is a belief in an immortal, eternalsoul that is born again and again in different bodies, a process called reincarnation. Although thebodies differ each time, the self—its distinct personality—remains unchanged. A rebirth might notbe into a human body, and birth as a human is seen as a precious and rare opportunity.The Hindu idea of reincarnation is closely tied to the concept of karma. Karma concernsan individual’s actions and the consequences of those actions. One’s life is what one has made it,and every action, thought, and desire—be they good or bad—will affect one’s next life. The lifeone lives now is the consequence of past actions. This cycle of birth, death, and rebirth in thisworld is known as Samsara. The ultimate goal is to escape from Samsara and achieve moksha,orliberation from the limitations of space, time, and matter. Because the achievement of salvationis difficult and complex, an individual will require multiple lifetimes to achieve it. Althoughthere is no mobility within a single lifetime, how the individual accepts and lives during that lifewill determine the level for the next reincarnation.Buddhist concepts of the soul, reincarnation, and karma differ in important ways. Buddhistsdo not believe in an immortal soul or a conscious personality that continues on. What is referred toas a soul, Buddhism conceives of as a combination of five mental and physical aggregates: the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death167physical body, feelings, understandings, will, and consciousness. These make up the humanpersonality, and this is what is caught up in the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.The Four Noble Truths state that life is imperfect and inevitably involves suffering. This suf-fering originates in our desires but will cease if all desires cease. The way to do this and to achieverelease from the cycle is to follow the Eightfold Path, which consists of right understanding, rightthought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right medi-tation. A person who does this can achieve Nirvana. The goal of Buddhism is not to go to someblissful heaven, but to extinguish desire and craving and escape from the suffering of this life.Buddhists also have the concept of karma, the belief that all of one’s actions, good or bad, helpcreate one’s personality. This process continues even after death. Rebirth is seen as the transmissionof karma. Buddha compared this process to a flame that passes from one candle to the next.However, it is only the flame of karma that is passed on, not a continuous personality. The Wheel ofLife (Figure 8.1) shows the thirty-one planes of existence, conceived of by some Buddhists aspsychological metaphors and by others as reality. These planes of existence include hells, hungryghosts (beings tormented by unsatisfied desires), animals, humans, and gods. Humans proceedaround and around this wheel, repeatedly experiencing suffering, unless we are freed into Nirvana.Following on the flame metaphor, Nirvanameans to extinguish, or to put out the flame of the candle.FIGURE 8.1The Wheel of Life.A painting of the Wheel of Life ona monastery wall in Tibet."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"168Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and DeathAncestorsOne possible fate for a soul is that it becomes part of the group of supernatural beings that areimportant to the living: ancestors. Writers have often used the term ancestor worshipto describethe beliefs and behaviors surrounding the veneration of ancestors. However, the use of the termworshipis falling out of favor because a number of researchers think that the ancestors arerespected and attended to but not really “worshipped.”The importance of ancestors to a culture is a reflection of the importance of kinship,generally kinship beyond the immediate family. Even after death a person is still a valued member of the kinship group, one who reinforces ideas of social roles and contributes to socialharmony and social solidarity. In some cultures the ancestors act as a moral force, punishing theirdescendants for misbehavior.However, not all souls become ancestors—or at least not ancestors who receive any ritualattention. For example, in societies in which descent is figured through men, mainly males maybecome ancestors. If a woman in such a culture were to become an ancestor, this would bedetermined by her relationship to a man, for example, by marriage or through her children.Although most ritual activity concerning ancestors is a family matter, in Africa it is common forthe ancestors of chiefs or kings to be considered responsible for things that concern the entirecommunity, such as rain, and therefore will be recognized by everyone.YORUBA ANCESTORS.Among the Yoruba of West Africa, ancestors play very important rolesin the continued welfare of their descendants, and much of their religious practice, including themaintenance of shrines and the performance of rituals, are centered on them.The Yoruba identify two broad classes of ancestors: family ancestors and deified ancestors.Of those who die, only a limited number become family ancestors. Ancestors are individualswho led noteworthy lives while alive. They lived to an old age and lived a good life, and theirdescendents are willing to perform the required rituals. It is one of the most important tasks ofthe family head to perform proper rituals for the family ancestors. The maintenance of goodrelations with the ancestors is important for the continued well-being of the family, for theancestors possess power to bring good or ill to their descendants. The ancestors provide guidanceand protection for the family but will punish family members who do not behave as they shouldand do not fulfill their obligations to the dead. Deified ancestors are those with great powers andare worshipped at shrines throughout the region. In fact, such ancestors may be thought of asgods with human origins.The egungunare spirits who have traveled from the land of the dead to visit the living.In ritual the ancestors are often represented by the egungundancers, who become conduitsbetween the living and the ancestors. An egungundancer is a man who wears a long grassrobe and a wood mask with a human or animal face. Several days after a funeral, the egungungoes to the house in which the person has died and tells the relatives that the deceased hasarrived in the land of the dead and is doing all right. Food is then given to the egungunand hisfollowers.On death an individual travels to the land of the dead. If the person has been good in life,he or she will lead a pleasant existence, but those who behaved badly will suffer. One of therewards of living a good life is to be remembered. As long as they are remembered, dead peopleare able to act as intermediaries between the gods and the family. The ancestors often contacttheir living family in dreams or through the aid of the egungun. Egungunmay appear at timeswhen the family needs advice and at the annual festival."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death169BENG ANCESTORS AND REINCARNATION.In some societies the soul travels to a new home;in others the soul is recycled into another being. When a person dies among the Beng of WestAfrica, the soul becomes a spirit that travels to wrugbe,one of many invisible spirit villages.After a while, the spirit is reborn as a human baby, although the spirit continues to exist as anancestor. The individual exists both as a reincarnated being on earth and, at the same time, as anancestral spirit.Every individual born is a reincarnation of an ancestor. Sometimes the identity of theancestor is known. In the case of a child born on the same day a family member dies, thenewborn is thought to be an instant reincarnation of the deceased. Knowing which ancestor hasbeen reincarnated in a particular newborn has important consequences, because it is assumedthat the child has the same personality traits of the ancestor and is treated as such. Most often,however, the identity of the ancestor remains unknown.People are able to travel to wrugbein their dreams to consult with ancestors. The ancestorsalso live with the family. At night a bowl of food is prepared for the ancestors and the family andthe ancestors sleep together. They return to wrugbeduring the day.When a baby is born, the spirit does not move from wrugbeto this world all at once, butemerges over a period of several years. This emergence does not even begin until the umbilicalcord falls off. A mixture of herbs is placed on the cord to dry it out so it will fall off sooner andthe infant can begin to move from wrugbeinto the living world. If an infant should die before thecord falls off, there is no funeral or public recognition of the death because the child’s spirit hadnever entered the world of the living.During early childhood, the child’s consciousness is sometimes in this life and sometimesin wrugbe.The parents do not want the child’s soul to return to wrugbe,so they do what they canto make the child’s life as attractive as possible. If a child is crying or uncomfortable, the child isthought to be homesick for wrugbe.The child attempts to communicate with the parents, but theparents do not understand the babbling. So a diviner is called. Usually the diviner suggests that acowry shell, coin, or other piece of jewelry be given to the child.TANA TORAJA ANCESTORS.The Tana Toraja are a horticultural people living in smallvillages growing rice and raising water buffalo and pigs in the mountains of Sulawesi, Indonesia.Ritually, their world is divided into the smoke-ascending part and the smoke-descending part.This division exists in both the physical and supernatural worlds. The smoke-ascending part isassociated with the rising sun in the east, the deata,and health and fertility rituals. The deataaregods and spirits that are associated with nature. They are found in mountains and rivers, trees andanimals, and the roofs of houses; they exist in the stars, clouds, rain, and mist. The smoke-descending dominion includes the neneor ancestors and the bomboor souls of people who haverecently died. This realm is associated with the setting sun in the west and with death rituals.Through ritual the bomboare transformed into nene, and the nenecan be transformed into deata.The smoke-ascending and smoke-descending realms must be kept separate, and thisrequirement lies at the heart of much of Torajan ritual. Ritual also includes the offering of food,such as rice, and the sacrifice of animals. This ritual activity is known as “feeding the gods.” Itpleases the gods, and they will, in turn, come to the aid of the people.The Torajans clearly separate physical death from social death. The definition of themoment of death in a modern industrial society has been made difficult because of life-prolongingmachines (Box 8.2). For example, the brain might cease functioning, but the heart is keptartificially beating. In Torajan society physical death is associated with the cessation of breathingand heartbeat. Yet it is not as simple as that because when breathing and heartbeat cease, when"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"170Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Deathphysical death has occurred, social death has not, for death is stretched out over an extended periodof time. This is a good example of how culture reinterprets natural events—in this case, death.When a person is physically dead, the individual is not said to have died, but is said to have a feveror to be sleeping. This knowledge is important because at this point, all smoke-ascending ritualsare forbidden. In terms of the supernatural, the act of dying is a process whereby the bombo(soul)begins to separate from the physical body.The social pronouncement of death does not take place for weeks and, in the case of veryimportant people, even years. The dead body is wrapped in a cloth or put in a wood coffin andplaced along the south wall of the house with the head to the west, which is the direction that isassociated with smoke-descending rituals. The corpse, which may or may not be partiallyembalmed, is said to be asleep. During this time the decaying body is still referred to as a personwith a fever. Offerings of food and drink are made to the dead person. People greet the deadperson when they enter the house, and they converse with the dead, keeping him or her up to dateabout what is happening to the family and the community. During this time the bomboof thedeceased stays close by and watches the preparations for its funeral. Soon the bombohas thepower to cause trouble or to bring blessings to the family.Torajan funeral rites are complex and important smoke-descending rituals that move thebombointo the next world, where it is transformed into a nene(ancestor). At the start of thefuneral the sound of a gong formally announces the death. Sacrifices are made, and the body ismoved to the west wall with its head pointing south, which is the direction in which it will travelto the afterlife.BOX 8.2Determining DeathDetermining when a person is dead is not as simple as it seems. Such a determination is a cultur-al interpretation of a series of biological events. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries manypeople feared that they would be declared dead when they in fact were not. Some coffins of thetime were outfitted with pull cords attached to outside bells so that if a person was buried alive,they could signal those on the outside by pulling on the cord. This fear of being buried alivelessened with the development of new technologies, such as the stethoscope.The modern debate on the determination of death has focused on the heart versus thebrain. Are you dead if you have no brain activity but your heart is still beating? This debate hasbeen influenced by the question “Which is the seat of the soul: the heart or the brain?” Modernmedicine has defined death as the cessation of brain activity, leading to the existence of “beating-heart cadavers” from which organs can be procured for transplantation into another individual.However, many families still deny consent for organ donation, fearing that the person is not reallydead yet. Although the EEG prevents misdiagnosis of brain death, people have difficulty seeingsomeone whose heart is beating as really being dead. Thousands of people are on waiting lists fororgan donation, and many die each year while waiting for organs to become available.Another interesting phenomenon associated with organ donation is the claim by someheart transplant recipients that they take on some of the qualities or personality traits of thedonor. Such a belief is clearly rooted in cultural beliefs about the soul."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death171The next day, the body is wrapped in cloth, and an effigy is made on which the familyhangs the personal possessions of the deceased. A few weeks later a water buffalo is prepared,and the body leaves the house along with household items and provisions for the soul’s journey.The body is moved toward the burial site along with the effigy, which is usually a frame ofbamboo but is carved of wood for an important person. Now the rituals begin that will separatethe physical corpse from the bombo.The buffalo is sacrificed, and the corpse is buried in alimestone cliff. If the effigy is carved of wood, it is placed on a ledge in the cliff along with othereffigy figures.The soul has now become an ancestor, and it begins its journey southward to Puya with theguardian buffalo. However, suicides, lepers, and people who did not play according to the rulesof society are not allowed to enter Puya. The life of a nenein Puya is very much like one’slife while breathing. The nenehas the same social rank as in life and is still wealthy or poor. Thenenekeeps an eye on the family to be sure that it is being properly honored. The nenehas thepower to bring aid and blessings as well as harm.Some time after the funeral the descendants perform the rituals to transform the neneinto adeata(god). Whereas the nenelives in the smoke-descending realm, the deatamoves tothe smoke-ascending realm. The deatajoins the other spirits in the trees, mists, and sky andcontinues to watch over its descendants, who continue to offer sacrifices.ANCESTORS AND THE DEPARTED IN JAPAN.In Japan, household-level religious activitieshave been the main means of contacting the supernatural. Understanding the structure andimportance of the household is essential to understanding relationships between the living andthe dead. The household is a corporate group that ideally will exist perpetually from the time ofits founding. One becomes a member of a household through kinship, but an individual maybe rejected if they are seen as unsuitable. There are four key household roles for the living: themaster and mistress of the house, the heir and his bride. If any of these roles are empty,the household is essentially incomplete and the roles should ideally be filled, often by recruitingsomeone from the outside. Marriage alone does not create a new line. For example, if themistress dies before the birth of an heir, her soul is believed to return to the household in whichshe was born.On death, the body is disposed of within a few days and the soul enters a period ofuncertainty. As in many other cultures, the soul is polluted by death and becomes potentiallydangerous. The soul may wander for many weeks before it is purified and made safe by a seriesof rituals. These rituals usually end forty-nine days after the death, although occasionally theliving feel it necessary to do additional rituals after this time. The soul then enters the clean andpeaceful world of the deceased and the ancestors.David Plath made a distinction for Japanese souls between the departed and the ancestors.3The departed are generally household members who died in recent memory. When a person dies,a tablet is prepared and is preserved and displayed in the house on a shelf or cabinet reserved forthat use. The deceased is remembered as an individual and the anniversary of the person’s deathdate will be celebrated until no one is left who knew that person alive. At this time, the departedperson will be retired to the ranks of the ancestors and the personal tablet is destroyed.Ancestors are thus dead regular household members that are not in living memory. Includedin this category are the founder of the household and people who were regular members of thehousehold at death. Any people born into the household, but who married out, were adopted out,or left to start a new household are not included. The ancestors usually share a single generictablet, remembered more as a collective than as individuals."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"172Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and DeathAs in other cultures, the dead in Japan are seen as a moral force. However, they operate asmoral authorities, not moral agents. The living strive to do well in life so they will not beashamed to stand before the dead. Although the dead do sometimes intervene in the affairs of theliving, this intervention is usually mild. In case of family misfortune, the family usually turnsfirst to geomancy, suspecting something wrong with the physical structure of the house. Only ifthe misfortune continues are the dead suspected. The dead, though, are also a source of securityand comfort. They are seen as generally friendly and supportive, and the relationship betweenthe living and dead is ideally one of mutual affection and gratitude.The souls in the category of the departed are interacted with as individuals and are treatedas though they were alive. For example, the living will prepare favorite foods or gather favoriteflowers. This is done at any time but is most common on the departed person’s death-dayanniversary. The souls are seen as being close by and accessible to the living. They can becontacted at the household shelf of tablets, the graveyard, and other places. However, they alsoreturn for a Midsummer holiday that is seen as a reunion for the living and dead. At the end ofthe holiday they are believed to be going off on a great journey. They are always present, but alsoare seen as coming and going from periodic household gatherings.Although the dead in some cultures are seen as a conservative force, this is not the case inJapan. The emphasis is not on behaving in very specific ways that existed in the past, but onbehaving in ways that will help continue the household line.BODIES AND SOULSAs we have seen, the concept of the soul is intimately connected with death. Although thesoul animates the living body, the soul also has a life beyond that of the physical. In thissection we will look at cases in which the soul and body are disconnected but one or the otherremains closely connected with the world of the living. These include ghosts, vampires, andzombies.GhostsThe distinction between a soul and a ghostis not always a clear one. They are both manifesta-tions of an individual after death. A soul is essentially good. It might hover around its corpse andthe family after death, but eventually it goes somewhere else or is reincarnated. However, soulscan bring misfortunate to the family if they are neglected or the family fails to perform the appro-priate funeral rituals. By contrast, a ghost is essentially a negative force and tends to remain inthe vicinity of the community. Ghosts can bring about illness and other misfortune; therefore,they have to be dealt with.DANI GHOSTS.When someone among the Dani of New Guinea dies, a supernatural elementcalled the mogatleaves the body. The mogatremains near the community and the family andbecomes a ghost.Dani ghosts will alert the community to enemy raids, thereby performing a service.However, ghosts are generally troublesome, and they are held responsible for a wide range ofmisfortunes, including accidents and illnesses of both people and pigs. The Dani are reluctant totravel in the dark for fear of being accosted by ghosts. However, these problems can be dealt withby rituals designed to placate the ghost, and, in truth, the Dani show more fear of ghosts in stories than they do in their everyday activities."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death173A major function of a funeral is to make the ghost happy and to keep it away from thecommunity. The ghost of a person who has been killed in war is especially dangerous. It must begiven a “fresh-blood” funeral, which is much more elaborate than the regular funeral given for aperson who dies in other ways. The ghost of a person who is killed in war is also placated by thekilling of an enemy.There are many ways to keep ghosts happy and to control the negative influence of ghosts.An essential element in Dani ceremonies is the killing of pigs during feasts, and food is alwaysgiven to the ghosts. (Although the food, especially pork, is set aside for the ghosts, eventuallysomeone will eat the ghosts’ share.) The Dani build small structures called ghost houses inseveral locations both within and outside the village as places where the ghosts can live.BUNYORO GHOSTS.The Bunyoro live in the East Africa Cattle culture area, and many of theirreligious activities center on relationships with ghosts. Ghosts are one of three significant causesof illness, the others being sorcery and the activities of spirits. When illness strikes, a Bunyorowill use the services of a diviner to determine the cause of the illness. If the misfortune is due toa ghost, the diviner will then proceed to identify the ghost. Generally, a ghost causes trouble forsomeone who is close to it and who has offended it in some way. A ghost will bring misfortuneto that individual’s relatives and descendants as well.The Bunyoro ghost is the disembodied spirit of a person who has died. It is a transformationof the soul. It is seen as being left by a deceased person but not being the deceased person per se.Unlike ghosts in Western cultures, Bunyoro ghosts are never seen except in dreams. Ghosts areessentially evil and are associated with the underworld as well as with specific places, such astheir graves. However, on the positive side, a ghost of a man may come to the aid of his son anddescendants.There are many ways in which a person can deal with ghosts. For example, there aretechniques for capturing ghosts, and once captured, the ghost can be destroyed or removed fromthe community. Other rituals keep the ghost away from the family. However, many ghosts remainin the community and will periodically possess a victim or a close relative, thereby entering intodirect communication with the living. Often the ghost will form a relationship with a livingperson, who will periodically sacrifice a goat to it and build a special ghost hut for it to live in.The belief in ghosts plays an important role in Bunyoro society. It gives the Bunyoro anexplanation for things that happen, such as illness, as well as methods, through ritual, of dealingwith these problems. The Bunyoro also believe that a ghost will cause trouble if it was treatedpoorly while living. This belief encourages people to behave properly toward family members soas to avoid problems after that person dies.JAPANESE GHOSTS.Japanese religious practice is a complex mixture of folk beliefs,Buddhist, Shinto, and Taoist influences and influences from cultures outside of Japan, especiallyChina. Throughout Japan, there is a belief in a variety of supernatural beings, the less savoryones including what Western writers call ghosts, demons, and goblins, among others. Notonly are these spirits found among the peasants of the countryside, but they also appear in urbancenters and have been immortalized in plays and art.Many Japanese believe that at death an individual is transformed into an impure spirit. Atspecified intervals over the next seven years the family performs various rituals of purification asthe spirit becomes an ancestral spirit. As an ancestral spirit, it watches over the family and helpsin time of crisis. However, during the seven-year period the impure spirit floats between the landof the living and the land of the dead. During this time it is important that the family perform the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"174Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Deathrequired rituals and make offerings; if this is not done, the spirit will hover close to the living,often in the form of a ghost, and cause misfortune. Also, if an individual dies under conditions ofgreat emotional stress, the spirit will remain in the world of the living as a ghost and haunt theindividuals who are responsible for its anguish. Many folktales tell of murder victims and unre-quited lovers who are so distraught at the moment of death that they remain on earth as ghosts.Ghosts are frequently depicted in traditional Japanese art. For example, some drawingsshow a female ghost “with long straight hair and waving or beckoning hands. Pale clothing withlong, flowing sleeves was draped loosely about the seemingly fragile figure, and the head andupper part of the body were strongly delineated. From the waist down, however, the form wasmisty and tapered into nothingness.”4The Living Dead: Vampires and ZombiesStories of resurrection from death are found in the mythology of many religious traditions. Fromthe Egyptian god Osiris, the Hebrew prophet Elijah, who could raise the dead and is himselfexpected to return, to Lazarus and Jesus, stories are told of those who die but later return to life.In these examples the individual is seen as special and the resurrection has great religioussignificance. In other cases, the dead returning to life is more ordinary. The resurrection canbe seen as positive, as when a person is allowed to return to life to comfort her family. Or it canbe seen as negative, as when a person returns to life to bring about death and destruction. In thissection we will look at examples of the latter, namely vampires and zombies. Both are familiarcreatures in the United States where countless books, movies, television shows, and video gamesfeature vampires and zombies as their main characters. However, the folk beliefs that underliethese creatures are often quite different from popular renditions.VAMPIRES.Much of U.S. vampire lore is largely based on Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula,published in 1897. Stoker based his book loosely on the historical figure of Vlad Tepes, or Vladthe Impaler, but made numerous changes. Tepes was a Romanian prince, not a count, who ruledin Walachia, not Transylvania, and who was never viewed as a vampire by the local population.In fact, Tepes is a local hero in Romania. More recently, vampires have been the focus of manypopular books and movies, including the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse series that portrayvampires as dangerous but romantic figures.The vampire is a creature that was considered to be real throughout much of Europe,primarily in parts of Eastern Europe, and they bear little resemblance to the depictions in thesenovels. Vampires were more likely to be shabbily dressed peasants than elegant counts andwere certainly not seen as romantic in any way. So who or what is a vampire? A vampire wasbelieved to be someone who had recently died but who had returned to bring death to others.The interest in vampires and the documentation of cases of vampirism began in theeighteenth century when parts of Serbia and Walachia were turned over to Austria. Austrianpatrol officials began recording the local custom of exhuming dead bodies and “killing” them.An important case comes from the Serbian village of Medvegia in the 1730s. The following is atranslated report of the case.5[A] local haiduk [a type of soldier] named Arnold Paole broke his neck in a fall froma hay wagon. This man had, during his lifetime, often revealed that, near Gossowa inTurkish Serbia, he had been troubled by a vampire, wherefore he had eaten from theearth of the vampire’s grave and smeared himself with the vampire’s blood, in order"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death175to be free of the vexation he had suffered. In twenty or thirty days after his deathsome people complained they were being bothered by this same Arnold Paole; andin fact four people were killed by him. In order to end this evil, they dug up thisArnold Paole forty days after his death . . . and they found that he was quite com-plete and undecayed, and that fresh blood had flowed from his eyes, nose, mouth,and ears; that the shirt, the covering, and the coffin were completely bloody; that theold nails on his hands and feet, along with the skin, had fallen off, and that new oneshad grown; and since they saw from this that he was a true vampire, they drove astake through his heart, according to their custom, whereby he gave an audible groanand bled copiously.In reality, much of the evidence for the return of Paole and others as vampires can be easily explained by anyone with knowledge of how corpses decompose. For example, as thecorpse decays, it becomes bloated with gas. This results in a red coloration of the skin and theappearance of a full abdomen. The gas also pushes blood into the mouth. When the villagersstaked Paole and reported that he groaned, what they most likely heard was the release of thisgas. Although his corpse appeared not to have decomposed, this also is not unusual. Corpsesactually decay at varying rates, and burial itself delays decomposition. In fact, all decomposingbodies would show these “vampire” features. However, only the bodies of those suspected ofvampirism were ever dug up and “killed.”Paul Barber points out that the people who were most likely to be labeled vampires werethose who were considered difficult, unpopular, or great sinners during their lifetime.6Hesuggests that a belief in vampires provided an explanation for unexplained deaths, especiallyfrom epidemic diseases and other unfortunate events. Even better than just an explanation,the attribution of misfortune to vampirism also provided a course of action: The vampire couldbe “killed.”THE VIKING DRAUGR.The Vikings believed that dead bodies continued to be animated in away within the grave. There were two main types: the haugbui,which remained within its burialmound, and the draugr,an animated corpse that could wander the countryside. Although some-times referred to as ghosts, the draugris more clearly an actual corpse. It is described as beingphysically black or blue as death or pale as a corpse. It swelled to an enormous size and had greatstrength as well as magical abilities including shape shifting, controlling the weather, and seeingthe future. The draugris described as having an unnatural hunger and in some ways resemblesthe European vampires described earlier.The draugrlongs for life and envies those who are still alive. Causing potential harm toboth people and animals, it cannot be killed by normal means. The draugrmust first be foughthand-to-hand and then decapitated before being burned to ashes, which must be either buried ordispersed at sea. Only then is the draugrtruly dead. Several customs associated with funeralswere acts designed to prevent the dead from rising. This included laying a pair of open scissorson the dead person’s chest and a piece of straw cross wise under the shroud.HAITIAN ZOMBIES.Although zombies are known from other cultures, they are most closelyassociated with Haiti and the religion of Vodou (Chapter 11). In contrast to vampires and draugr,who are believed to bring death and are therefore feared, Haitian zombies themselves are not tobe feared. The fear associated with zombies is the fear of being made into one. Zombies are seenas soulless creatures, animated for a life of slavery on a plantation."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"176Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and DeathThere are a few documented cases that, although controversial, seem to show that zombifi-cation actually occurs. These involve people whose death and burial were documented and whowere then observed to return. On the basis of these cases a Haitian psychiatrist named Dr. Lamarque Douyon requested the help of an ethnobotanist to track down the zombie powder.Dr. Douyon thought that the victim was given a drug that made him or her appear to be dead.After the burial the person who had administered the powder would dig up and revive the victim.Dr. Douyon received help from Wade Davis, then a graduate student at Harvard University.Davis’s account of his research was published in 1985 in the book The Serpent and the Rainbow,which was later made into a movie.7Davis claims that he was able to acquire some of the zombie powder and analyze it. Thekey ingredient turned out to be pieces of dried puffer fish. Puffer fish is considered a delicacy inJapan, where only specially licensed chefs are allowed to prepare it owing to the poisonousnature of the fish. A small amount of the poison is considered exhilarating. It causes tingling ofthe spine, prickling of the lips and tongue, and euphoria. Still, several dozen Japanese peopleevery year get tetrodotoxin poisoning from eating puffer fish, and some die. A victim of this kindof poisoning is likely to make a full recovery if he or she survives the first few hours. So why doHaitian poisoning victims end up zombies but Japanese victims do not?Davis pointed out the importance of cultural context and expectations. Haitians who prac-tice Vodou believe that it is possible for a powerful priest to control the part of the soul known asti-bonaj. This soul is associated with a person’s personality and individuality. When the person’sti-bonajis captured, the person is deprived of will, and his or her body can be held as a slave.These beliefs are necessary underpinnings to the zombification phenomenon. Davis alsosuggested that the threat of zombification is used as a social control mechanism.Davis’s theory is very controversial, as are some of his research methods. Some questionwhether he paid for the zombie powder and participated in the exhumation of the corpse. Evenmore damaging is the inability of others to find tetrodotoxin in samples of the powder or to verify how the powder would work. In all, Davis’s work remains unproven but provides an inter-esting hypothesis.ZOMBIES IN MODERN AMERICAN CULTURE.The U.S. military occupation of Haiti(1915–1934) brought an awareness of Haitian culture and Vodou. By 1932 the first Americanzombie horror movie, White Zombie, had been released. The movie with the largest impact onportrayals of zombies though is George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead(1968). Romero por-trayed zombies not as driven by a Vodou priest to work but instead as driven to eat flesh, startingthe popular culture association of zombies and eating brains.Supernatural figures reflect our contemporary fears and anxieties. With zombies, we see botha fear of losing our individuality to become part of the zombie horde and apocalyptic themes basedon anxieties about the government and large corporations. Zombies are often said to have been cre-ated due to radiation or government or corporate experiments gone awry, such as in the movie andgames Resident Evil. The general movie or video game scenario pits a small group of heroesagainst the encroaching zombie horde, often part of a larger societal collapse or conflict. The clas-sic video game Wolfenstein 3D,for example, pits the player against zombie Nazis during WorldWar II. Unlike Haitian zombies, the modern zombie is a monster who can be killed guilt-free.Zombies have seen a cultural resurgence in recent years, surpassing even vampires in theirpopularity. Unlike vampires who only threaten one individual at a time and have often been castas romantic figures, zombies menace the entire human race and are portrayed as mindless, sham-bling, and decaying. An element of comedy is also often present in modern zombie portrayals."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death177Many movies combine comedy and horror into what Bruce Campbell, star of the movie EvilDead, termed “splatstick.” The popularity of the mash-up novel Pride, Prejudice and Zombiesand the game Plants vs. Zombiesare further examples.DEATH RITUALSDeath rituals or funerals can be thought of as rites of passage whereby an individual moves fromthe status of living to that of dead (or another post death state such as ancestor). The loss of amember of the community, especially an important member, can be very traumatic. We can thinkof a death as a disruption of the social fabric of the family and community that needs to be mended.Death rituals also provide a way of channeling behavior in what can be a highly emotional state.Funeral rituals provide explanations for death and for what happens after death. In thesefunctions, funerals are acting very much like social rites of intensification.However, death rituals differ in many ways from other rites of passage. One of the moststriking features is the presence of the body of the deceased. Even if the body does not play a rolein the ritual itself, it is present, and something must be done about it.Funeral RitualsFunerals permit and channel expressions of grief. All people feel grief, but it can be manifestedin many ways. In some societies there are specific times when it is appropriate to express griefand times when it is not. Some societies, including British and U.S. societies, emphasizecontrol of one’s emotions. Grieving is often done privately, not in public, even at the funeralservice. The length of time that is set aside for grieving is often limited, and after a periodof time, the close relatives are expected to once again take up their lives. Even when grievingis publicly conducted and is very boisterous, it is still limited in time, and its expression isculturally channeled.Among the Murngin of Australia funeral rituals actually begin before death. The family andband gather around the dying person and begin to wail and sing song cycles to comfort the dying.The songs also provide instructions to the soul so that it will make it to the totemic well and notcause difficulties for the family. Although some of the emotional energy of the men is directedtoward revenge for the death (death is usually caused by sorcery or fighting), grief is more explic-itly expressed by the women, who take sharp sticks or stone knives and cut their heads so thatthey bleed.Earlier, we described the funeral rituals of the Torajans of Indonesia as part of the discus-sion of ancestors. Here we have a good example of the cultural expression of grief and how theoutward expression of grief does not always coincide with the internal emotion of grief. In TanaToraja there is a strong cultural pressure not to show one’s emotions and to keep sadness andanger hidden from others. The Torajans believe that such emotions are bad for one’s healthand are disruptive to interpersonal relationships. However, in the context of death, Torajans canand are expected to express grief.When the corpse is kept in the house between the time the person physically dies and thebeginning of the funeral, wailing does not occur, and the family remains calm. When the funeralfinally begins, which might be several months later, there are particular times when it is appropri-ate to cry and wail. Wailing is loud and expresses both grief and sympathy for the family of thedeceased. Wailing occurs when people are near the body or an effigy figure, and they sometimescover their faces and touch the body."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"178Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and DeathFunerals are for both the living and the dead. Frequently, the fate of the soul depends onthe proper rituals being performed correctly by the family. Thus while rituals may comfort theliving, they may explicitly function to move the soul out of the community to some other place,such as a “land of the dead.”Often the most important issues are to protect the living by separating the living from thedead and to move the soul away from the living community so that it cannot cause harm.There are many ways in which living and dead are separated. Often the personal property of thedeceased is destroyed. This eliminates anything that might attract the soul and encourage it tostay. The Nuer, a pastoralist group in East Africa, quickly bury the body and obliterate the graveso that the soul cannot find its body and therefore will leave. Other ways of moving the soul areto frighten it with firecrackers, as was done in China, or to build some type of barrier that ghostswill not cross.The need to protect the community from ghosts is made very explicit in funeral rituals of theDani of New Guinea. Karl Heider describes a Dani funeral and writes: “In every way, explicit aswell as implicit, the funeral acts shout out to the ghosts: ‘See this! See what we do for you!’ Andthen, although this part is not so often said in words: ‘Now go away and leave us in peace!’ ”8Disposal of the BodyThe focal point of most funeral rituals is the corpse, and one of the most important activities in afuneral is the process of disposing of the corpse. In some societies it is truly a disposal, for it isthought that as long as the body is intact, the soul will not leave. In some cultures burial takesplace quickly, often within twenty-four hours; in others the body may be kept for several days oreven longer before burial. This is especially true if some type of preservation is practiced and thebody plays an integral part in the ritual.BURIAL.Perhaps the most common means of disposing of a body is burial. In analyzing burials,there are many variables that we can look at, such as where the body is buried. Often there is asacred place for burials, such as a cemetery or cave. A cemetery may be restricted to a particularethnic group or social class or people characterized by a particular cultural feature such asoccupation or cause of death. Warriors who die in battle or women who die in childbirth are oftenburied in special areas. (U.S. culture provides special cemeteries for members of the military, forexample.) Some cemeteries contain unmarked graves; others contain very elaborate tombs.However, bodies are not always placed in special places. Often they are buried near the house oreven under the floor of the house. This occurs frequently when the soul becomes an ancestor andthe family wishes to keep the ancestor close by.The body can be simply wrapped in a blanket or cloth, and sometimes the blanket or clothhas special designs and may be prepared early in life. The body can be placed in a wood coffin ofvarious shapes and designs or in a pottery vessel. The position of the body may be influenced bythe size and shape of the container. A body can be stretched out in a coffin (most frequently onits back but sometimes on its side or stomach) but would be bound in a fetal position if placed ina pottery vessel. Sometimes the body is oriented in a particular direction with the head oftenpositioned in the direction of some sacred place.Often the body is prepared in some way before being placed in a container or in theground. The body may be decorated or clad in special clothing. Sometimes the body is painted.Grave goods may be placed in the grave, ranging from simple mementos to elaborate gravegoods. And the grave goods may include sacrificed animals or sacrificed people."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death179FIGURE 8.2The African Burial Ground.Archaeologists excavate the eighteenth-century burial ground located in front of the Javits Federal Building in lowerManhattan in 1991.THE AFRICAN BURIAL GROUND.Much of our knowledge of history comes from writtendocuments. Written records, however, document only a few segments of society, usually theimportant and literate, and those activities, such as shipping, that require that careful records bekept. Answering specific historical questions will send the researcher to archives, genealogicalrecords, and old newspapers. But what about the uneducated, the poor, and the disenfranchised?Although they might have played important roles in society, their very existence remains poorlydocumented.For example, we normally do not think of slavery in northern cities, yet slaves in New YorkCity in the eighteenth century made up a significant portion of the population at that time. Andpeople die and need to be buried. People of European ancestry built churches with adjacentcemeteries within the city limits, but those on the fringes of society, such as slaves, had to burytheir dead on land outside of the city limits that was set aside for this purpose.A cemetery containing the remains of slaves was discovered in New York City in 1991when contractors started to excavate a lot for a new government office building in lowerManhattan. Located at Broadway and Reade Street, it is known today as the African BurialGround (Figure 8.2).This cemetery dates from the eighteenth century and was in use until 1795. At this time itwas located several miles outside the limits of a city that was considerably smaller than it istoday. Over 400 skeletons were removed for analysis and later reburied.Besides the skeletons themselves, there is much evidence of cultural practices. Many of theteeth have been filed and modified in some way, a custom that was common in western and centralAfrican cultures. Most, but not all, of the bodies were buried in wooden coffins. The most commonartifacts recovered were shroud pins, which held together the cloth used to wrap the bodies. Somecultural items were placed into the coffin with the body, including jewelry, glass beads, and coins.The coffins were oriented with the heads to the west. We do not know exactly what thismeans, but several explanations have been suggested, including a belief that on the Day ofJudgment the bodies would sit upright in their graves with their eyes to the east, the direction of"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"180Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Deaththe rising sun and the direction of Africa, their homeland. Although only about 400 graves wereexcavated, it has been estimated that as many as 10,000 people were buried in the cemeterythroughout the eighteenth century. The government office building was never constructed on thesite, and the lot has been turned into a memorial park.SECONDARY BURIALS.Funeral rituals sometimes include two burials. The first takes place atdeath and involves burial or some other disposition of the body. The second takes place at a latertime, perhaps months or years later. This second phase often marks the end of the mourningperiod and commonly involves digging up, processing, and reburying the body in some way.This is sometimes related to conceptions of the soul and the idea that what happens to the bodymirrors or in some way affects what happens to the soul after death.Among the Murngin of Australia, each kin group is associated with one or more sacredwater holes, where totemic spirits live (Chapter 3). The spirit comes out of the water hole, oftenin a father’s dream, and asks the father to point out its mother; the spirit then enters its mother’swomb. If a baby dies, its spirit returns to the water hole, becomes a spirit once again, and waitsto be reborn. When an adult dies, the spirit returns to the totemic well, where it will alwaysremain a spirit, never again to be reborn.After death has occurred, totemic designs are painted on the body, which becomes thecenterpiece of singing and dancing. It is then carried to the grave. The grave is a symbol ofthe sacred well, and the body is placed into the grave, laid out straight with the face down. Thenthe grave is filled in.After two or three months or more, the body is exhumed. Any remaining flesh is thenremoved from the bones, and the bones are washed. Some of the small bones, such as finger bones,are kept as relicsby close relatives. The cleaned bones are placed on bark paper and made into abundle. The bones are watched over for several months. A coffin is then made from a tree trunk thathas been hollowed out by termites that is carved into its proper shape. The bones are broken up witha stone and placed into the log. The log is left to rot, and the bones are left to decay.CREMATION.Cremation is not as common as burial, yet many cultures practice cremation fora variety of reasons. Sometimes it is a reaction against the process of decay, which is thought tobe a highly dangerous process. It is also a way to destroy the corpse so that the soul is cut offfrom its former body. In modern industrial societies cremation is becoming more popular as landbecomes more and more valuable and crowded and less land is available for cemeteries. Also,cremation is more economical than burial, and cremation becomes more popular as the cost ofburial increases.Among the Yanomamö, after a person has died, the body is decorated. It is then brought toa pile of firewood that has been set up in the open area in the middle of the community, and thebody is burned. The smoke from the fire is thought to be contaminating, and bows and arrows arewashed afterward. Children and the ill leave the village while the body is being cremated toavoid contamination from the smoke. After cooling, bits of unburned bones and teeth areremoved from the ashes and saved in a hollow log.The Yanomamö are endocannibalistic anthropophagers. The term endocannibalismrefers to the eating of one’s own people, and anthropophagersrefers to the eating of humanbodies. (We have already seen the example of ritual eating of noncremated bodies among theFore, described in Chapter 1.) The cremated bones are pulverized and placed into several smallgourds. Later a series of memorial rituals will be performed in which the ground ashes from the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death181gourds will be added to a plantain soup and consumed. The Yanomamö say they do this so thatthe dead will find a home in the bodies of the living. They are horrified by our unfeeling practiceof leaving the dead to rot in the ground—a good example of cultural relativism.MUMMIFICATIONIn some cultures, such as those that practice cremation, it is important todestroy the body to release the soul. Other cultures stress the importance of maintaining theintegrity of the body after death. The U.S. practice of embalming is not intended so much topreserve the body for all time as to prevent decay during the funeral period and to permitthe display of a lifelike body. Other peoples, however, stress the need to prevent decay ofthe flesh for all time. Besides embalming, some peoples smoke the body or preserve the bodyin salt or oil.To the ancient Egyptians, death was the next step in a continuation of life. To participate inthis new life, the body had to be preserved. The Egyptians developed a process ofmummificationthat by New Kingdom times (ca. 1570–1070 B.C.E.) was able to thoroughlypreserve the body.The process of mummification was complex and time consuming and could be practiced inits complete form only for the important and wealthy. The first step was to thoroughly remove asmuch of the water in the body as possible by burying it in the mineral natron for seventy days.The internal organs were removed and preserved in jars, and the body cavity was filled withresin-soaked linen. The body was then wrapped in additional linen, and hot resin was painted onthe wrapping to form a hard layer. Finally, the entire body was wrapped in a cast made of linenand plaster.EXPOSUREAnother possibility is to expose the body to the elements or to be consumed byanimals. This very effectively and quickly reduces the body to just bones. In some cases thebones would then be collected for further processing or burial. Again the disposal method mayreflect soul beliefs—in this case the belief that once the soul has departed the body, the physi-cal body itself is unimportant. Among the Inuit, who live in the Arctic, exposure was largelydone out of necessity, because the ground was unsuitable for burial.Some North American societies placed the body up in a tree or on a high platform, whereit would be exposed to the elements. Sometimes the body would be placed in a cave, and in thehot, arid climate of the American Southwest the body would become a natural mummy. In Tibetwe find sky burials, in which the body was consumed by birds. Perhaps this type of body dispos-al developed because of the difficulty of digging a grave in the hard ground and the scarcity offuel for cremation. Special areas were set aside for sky burial where the body was cut into piecesand the bones smashed to be consumed by vultures.U.S. Death Rituals in the Nineteenth CenturyIn the United States in the early nineteenth century a person would most likely die at home,especially in rural areas, surrounded by family, friends, clergy, and perhaps a physician. Deathoften was a public affair, and the “audience” showed concern about the medical and religiouscondition of the dying person.Once death occurred, the close members of the family took responsibility for the prepara-tion of the body for burial. This was done primarily by female family members rather than by aprofessional undertaker. The body was ritually washed and groomed, and a cloth or shroud was"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"182Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Deathwrapped around the body. Finally, the corpse was placed in a coffin. The coffin was most likelymade after death to the measurements of the person, although some people prepared shrouds andcoffins for themselves before their death.The body stayed in the home for one to three days in the parlor. Furniture was removed,mirrors were covered, and black crepe was hung. If the weather was warm, ice was often placedaround the body to slow decay. Family members would keep a vigil by the body, and peoplewould come to the house to view the body, recite sections from the Bible, socialize, and eat.Finally, after a brief service the family and friends formed a procession, and the coffinwas carried to the gravesite. Early in the century, especially in rural areas, the body would beburied on family land. However, as communities grew, burials more frequently occurred incemeteries. If the distance between the home and the cemetery was short, the coffin would becarried; later this was replaced by the hearse, a horse-drawn carriage specially built for thispurpose that could be rented from a livery stable. Sometimes the procession stopped at achurch for a public funeral service and perhaps a final viewing of the body before continuingon to the graveyard. The body would finally be buried in the ground or placed into anaboveground tomb.Things changed during the Civil War, during which more than 600,000 men died. (This isa very large number, especially when compared with the 57,777 who died during the VietnamWar and the 405,399 who died in World War II.) After a battle there were so many corpses that itwas not possible to give them the respectful treatment that was expected during other times.However, attempts were made to give the bodies a proper burial if at all possible and to mark thegraves so that relatives could locate the bodies later. Moreover, many families wanted theremains shipped home to be buried with proper ceremony in the family plots, and they wouldprovide money for this purpose. In 1862, Congress authorized the establishment of militarycemeteries, and twelve were created during that year near major battlefields, forts, and hospitals.These included Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.,on the estate that had belonged to the Confederate General Robert E. Lee.Sometimes a family member would find a grave that was located near a battlefield, removethe remains, and ship them home. A thriving business developed in metal, cement, and marblecoffins that would preserve the remains for a time. However, the most significant development inthe area of corpse preservation was the increasing use of embalming, a process that did not occurin the local funeral when a person died in his or her own bed.Embalming was practiced beginning in the 1840s to preserve medical cadavers. It was notuntil the Civil War that this process became widely used in the general population to preserve thebodies of those who had died in battle so that they could be shipped home for proper burial.Undertakers who specialized in embalming set up shops near hospitals and army camps and intents next to battlefields. Thus a new form of burial practice was introduced into U.S. culture.U.S. Funeral Rituals TodayU.S. society is very heterogeneous, and we must take note of the tremendous variation in funeralpractices, especially among recent immigrants. However, we can describe what might be calleda “traditional U.S. funeral.”Today most people in the United States die in hospitals or nursing homes. When the indi-vidual is formally pronounced dead, the care of the body passes from the medical to the ritualspecialists: the clergy and the funeral director. The death is announced in the obituary section ofthe local newspaper as word spreads by mouth throughout the network of family and friends. The"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death183body is then removed to the funeral home, where it is prepared by embalming. (Not all bodies areembalmed. Orthodox Judaism, for example, prohibits embalming; the bodies are refrigerated,and burial takes place soon after death.)The purpose of embalming in the United States today is not to preserve the body foreternity, as in the case of Egyptian mummification, but to hold off the start of decay until thefuneral is completed and to give the body a lifelike appearance for purposes of display. Peoplefeel that it is necessary to view the body to demonstrate that the individual is indeed dead. Thismakes the death seem real. They will go to great lengths to recover bodies for this purpose. In thecase of major disasters, expensive recovery operations are mounted for the purpose of recoveringremains, which then become the focal point of death rituals.Before the funeral ritual there is often a viewing, at which the body is put on display. Thereis little formal ritual at a viewing, yet there are what appear to be standards in the objects that aredisplayed (such as flowers and photographs), people dressing in somber colors, and words thatare said to the survivors. People often sit or stand around and tell stories of the deceased.People in the United States have relatively little experience with death compared withmembers of other societies and are often ill at ease in its presence. Commonly, a person will notattend his or her first funeral until adulthood. In other societies children would be presentthroughout a person’s illness, death, and funeral. There is also a special vocabulary for thingsassociated with U.S. funerals that is thought to be more acceptable than more traditional terms—funeral directorfor undertaker and casketfor coffin, for example.The viewing is followed by the funeral ritual, which may be religious or secular. U.S. funeral rituals are relatively short, usually lasting a half hour to a full hour. Typically,friends, neighbors, and coworkers will take a few hours off of a normal working day to attend thefuneral before returning home or back to work. These rituals are relatively quiet; there is littleoutward expression of grief. The casket is then taken in procession to the gravesite, where there isusually a short graveside ritual. Often the mourners leave the gravesite before the grave is filledin. This is followed by an informal gathering of family and friends at a family member’s homethat includes informal feasting and conversation, usually with little or no ritual.In recent times some changes have been seen in U.S. practices around death. Cremation hasbecome a popular alternative to burial, and the growth of grief recovery therapy shows a new recog-nition that funerals and U.S. culture do not always provide the best means of coping with suchevents. Even modern technology has had an impact, with email condolences and websites honoringthe deceased becoming more common. (See Box 8.3 for a discussion of roadside memorials.)Days of DeathFestivals that emphasize death and frame it as a concept are found cross-culturally. The one mostfamiliar in the United States is probably Halloween, although few know much about the originsand religious underpinnings of what has become a secular day of costumes and candy.HALLOWEEN.In essence, the holiday of Halloween has its origins as a case of culture contact,a theme that will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. The basis of this holiday is an ancientCeltic festival called Samhain. Samhain was New Year’s Day and was celebrated on November1. The Celts believed that during Samhain the gates that normally separate the worlds of theliving and the dead were opened, and the souls of those who had died during the past year couldthen move into the otherworld. To celebrate the day, special foods were prepared as offerings,and people dressed up as spirits and wild animals."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"184Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and DeathWith the conversion of Ireland to Christianity in 300–400 C.E. many local religious beliefs andpractices were redefined. In a practice that continues to this day, Christian missionaries were encour-aged to reframe local customs in Christian terms. November 1 was soon declared All Saints Day, asa day to honor the Christian saints, particularly those who did not otherwise have a feast day. Theday before All Saints Day, October 31, became known as the Eve of All Saints, or the Even of AllHallows, which was shortened to Hallow Even or Halloween. However, the meaning of All SaintsDay was not at all related to the original Celtic holiday, and it was not very successful in replacing it.Around 900 C.E. the Christian Church added the holiday of All Souls Day on November 2.This holiday honors all of the people who have died during the past year and is much closer inmeaning to Samhain. Many of the traditional beliefs and customs of Samhain were preserved,including the idea that night was a time for the wandering dead, the offering of food and drink tomasked revelers, and the lighting of bonfires. Stylized representations of death, includingskeletons, are common.DAY OF THE DEAD (DIA DE LOS MUERTOS).The Mexican Day of the Dead is also associatedwith the Catholic holidays of All Saints Day and All Souls Day on November 1 and 2. Much likeHalloween, the Day of the Dead is associated with cultural contact. This time the influencecomes from the Aztec culture. The Aztecs set aside a month (which would correspond to the endof July and early August in our calendar) to honor the dead. The festivities were overseenby Mictecacihuatl, or the “Lady of the Dead.” Later, Spanish priests moved the celebration tocoincide with All Saints Day and All Souls Day.BOX 8.3Roadside MemorialsUnlike a formal, structured funeral that takes place in a space designated for death and mourning,roadside memorials are informal and mark the spot where the death occurred rather than the finalresting place for the body. These memorials can be found not just all over the United States, butall over the world. The memorials vary but generally consist of a cross and flowers, pictures of thedeceased, and other personal items.These public markers of private grief are most commonly found at sites of traffic accidents andusually appear quite quickly after the incident. Some are temporary, but some last for years and maybe tended to and added to during that time. The memorials tend to mark deaths that are sudden andunexpected. In addition to those found at sites of traffic accidents, such impromptu memorials wereseen at Columbine High School following the shootings there, at Buckingham Palace after the deathof Princess Diana, and near the sites of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon after September 11, 2001.Roadside memorials in the United States are not uncontroversial. For some they involve theissue of freedom of speech; for others they violate the separation of church and state (an overwhelm-ing majority of the memorials contain crosses). There is no federal law governing the memorials, andstates have dealt with the issue in different ways. Here the concern is generally one of traffic safety,as the displays might interfere with traffic or distract drivers. Some states ban roadside memorials;others allow them, but may remove them if they are thought to interfere with traffic; other stateshave official memorials that can be purchased from the appropriate governmental agency."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death185FIGURE 8.3The Day of the Dead.A woman in Michoacan, Mexico, decorates a grave during Díade los Muertos.In what is often referred to as the “folk Catholicism” of Mexico, the dead are seen asintermediaries between the living and God. The Day of the Dead is a time of family reunion, forall family members living and dead, and is an expression of family continuity. This is not seenas macabre or as a solemn event but as a celebration. During the first week in November, shopsoffer many special items for this celebration. Included are many representations of skeletons,elaborate wreaths and crosses, and papal picado,or tissue paper cutouts. Food items are alsopopular, including special bread called pan de muertoand skulls and coffins made out of sugar.An altar is set up in the home with pictures of saints, candles, incense, vases of flowers,and portraits of the deceased. Offerings of food and drink are made to the dead, especially foodthat was a favorite of that person while he or she was alive. Gravesites are decorated, and a feasttakes place in the graveyard (Figure 8.3). The souls of children return first and then those ofadults. The souls do not physically consume the food but are believed to absorb its essence.CONCLUSIONIssues of life and death are of central concern for the domain of religion. What makes us alive?What happens to us when we die? Can my soul exist without my body? Can my body existwithout my soul? Although cultures will answer these questions differently, humans mustuniversally come to some sort of understanding and explanation of these phenomena. Thebelief in some sort of soul, for example, appears to be universal, as is the idea that the soulsurvives the death of the body, at least for some time. A belief in a soul explains many thingsfor us, such as an individual’s life force and unique personality and what happens to that"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"186Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and DeathSummaryThe belief in the existence of a spirit entityresiding within a person appears to have grownout of observations of sleep, coma, and death. Asoul is the noncorporeal, spiritual component ofan individual. Usually, each individual possessesa soul that takes on the personality of the indi-vidual and has an existence after death. Duringlife the soul may leave the body. Dreams areseen as adventures of the soul, and illness maybe caused by an absence of a soul that must beretrieved by a shaman. Death is the permanentwithdrawal of the soul. How the soul is per-ceived varies widely, including the number ofsouls, the size of the soul, and where the soul islocated in the body. The soul may retain its iden-tity after death for a limited time or eternity. Thedestination of the soul after death may dependon the behavior of the person during life, thesocial status of the individual, or perhaps theway in which the person died. Funeral ritualsmay assist the soul on its journey to the land ofthe dead and serve to protect the living from anynegative influences of the soul. Sometimes thesoul returns and animates another individual, aconcept termed reincarnation.One possible fate for a soul is that itbecomes part of the group of supernatural beingsknown as ancestors. Even after death, a person isstill a valued member of the kinship group andreinforces ideas of social roles, contributes tosocial harmony and social solidarity, and punishesdescendants for misbehavior.Ghosts are negative forces that remain inthe vicinity of the community after death. Theycan bring about illness and other misfortune,although their role is sometimes ambiguous. Incontrast, vampires and zombies are creatures thathave no souls. Vampires are believed to be indi-viduals who have recently died, usually beforetheir time, and have returned to bring death toothers. The body of an alleged vampire will beexhumed and “killed” or destroyed in some way.Zombies are corpses that have been raised fromtheir graves and animated.Death rituals or funerals are rites of pas-sage that move the individual from the status ofliving person to that of ancestor or other post-death status. Funerals vary among cultures in anumber of ways: the form of the expression ofgrief, the role of the ritual in terms of what willhappen to the individual in the afterlife, the ritualways in which the family and communityseparate themselves from the dead to avoid con-tamination or illness, how the living are reorga-nized in society to accommodate for the absenceof the deceased, and the method of disposal ofthe corpse.Many cultures allow for the return of the spir-its of the dead at special times of the year. A famil-iar example is Halloween, which is based on an oldCeltic holiday when the gates that normally sepa-rate the worlds of the living and the dead wereopened and the souls of those who had died duringthe past year could then move into the otherworld.The early Church transformed this celebration intoAll Saints Day and All Souls Day on November 1and 2, respectively. The Day of the Dead (Día delos Muertos) in Mexico is also associated with theseCatholic holidays. The family, including both theliving and the dead, gather together for celebration.personality when all that remains is a corpse. So important to us are the souls of other peoplethat they often remain a part of the world of the living, numbered among the beings thatpopulate the supernatural world.Our unease about death manifests itself in supernatural creatures such as ghosts, vampires,and zombies. Through these beings the divisions between life and death become less clear andmany other cultural anxieties come into play. In the next chapter we will turn our attention toother supernatural beings more commonly associated with religion: gods and spirit beings."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 • Souls, Ghosts, and Death187Suggested ReadingsPaul Barber, Vampires, Burials and Death: Folkloreand Reality(New Haven, CT: Yale UniversityPress, 1988).[Looks at European folklore about vampires andthe scientific explanations for some of the phe-nomena.]Nigel Barley, Grave Matters: A Lively History of Deatharound the World(New York: Henry Holt, 1995).[A look at how different cultures define andreact to death.]Bob Curran, Zombies: A Field Guide to the WalkingDead(Franklin Lakes, New Jersey: The CareerPress, 2009).[A look at zombies in different cultures.]Wade Davis, The Serpent and the Rainbow(New York:Touchstone, 1985).[An ethnobotanist’s experiences in Haiti search-ing for the “zombie drug.”]Alma Gottlieb, The Afterlife Is Where We Come From:The Culture of Infancy in West Africa(Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 2004).[An exploration of how religious ideologyimpacts Beng childrearing practices.]Gary Laderman, The Sacred Remains: AmericanAttitudes toward Death, 1799–1883(New Haven,CT: Yale University Press, 1996).[Presents the history of mortuary practices in theUnited States in the nineteenth century.]Peter Metcalf and Richard Huntington, Celebrations ofDeath: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual(Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press,1991)[A cross-cultural study of the rituals that accom-pany death.]Lisa Miller, Heaven: Our Enduring Fascination withthe Afterlife(New York: Harper Collins,2010)[Looks at the historical roots of the concept ofheaven and how and why it has changed overtime.]Heather Pringle, The Mummy Congress: Science,Obsession and the Everlasting Dead(New York:Hyperion, 2002).[A look at mummies and the people who studythem.]FictionPiers Anthony, On a Pale Horse(New York: BallantineBooks, 1983).[Book 1 of the Incarnations of Immortalityseries.

As in any commercial venture,a special vocabulary develops that replaces manyfamiliar terms. Look up some websites for funeralhomes and cemeteries and examine the vocabu-lary that is used. What terms are used today inplace of older terms such as undertaker, coffin,corpse,and death? What other examples can youfind?2.We can divide methods for disposing of the bodyinto two main categories: those that preserve thebody or part of the body and those that result in thecomplete disappearance of the body. Is there anycorrelation between these two categories and how areligion views death and the afterlife?3.Discuss the practice of cryogenics as a method ofhandling a body after death. How is cryogenicssimilar to mummification?4.Describe the customs surrounding the festival ofHalloween in contemporary U.S. society. Do yousee any religious elements in this festival today?What elements that are secular today are derivedfrom religious elements in the past?5.Many Hollywood movies show images of ghosts,vampires, and zombies. How do these imagesresemble or differ from these entities as theyappear in actual religious systems?"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"189CHAPTERGods and SpiritsGhosts, ancestors, and vampires are transformed human beings. However, there are manysupernatural beings that generally do not have human origins. These supernatural beingsinclude godsand spirits. Although we recognize these as two separate types of supernat-ural entities, this division is to some degree arbitrary. Generally speaking, gods are individualizedsupernatural beings, each with a distinctive name, personality, and sphere of influence thatencompasses the life of an entire community or a major segment of the community. Spirits aregenerally less powerful than gods and usually are more localized. Frequently, they are collectionsof nonindividualized supernatural beings that are not given specific names and identities.Supernatural beings are usually a crucial aspect of a religious system; many anthropologistshave defined religion by the presence of such beings. Myths describe the actions of these beings,and their behavior may be seen as a model for human behavior. Rituals are often directed towardsuperhuman beings—to placate, praise, or make requests.SPIRITSNonindividualized spirits include the leprechauns of Ireland, the jinn of the Middle East, and thekami of Japan. There are also spirits that are individually recognized, such as a guardian spirit, anancestral spirit, and a shaman’s spirit helper. In contrast with gods, spirits are less powerful andare more focused on particular individuals, families, or groups of specialists.Whereas gods may live in a remote location, such as Mount Olympus, the home of theGreek gods, spirits live in the human world, interacting with humans and concerned about whathumans are up to. Spirits often exhibit complex personalities. They may be friendly or harmful.They provide protection, success, and luck but also are blamed for minor mishaps. One can ask fortheir assistance, because they are closely connected to people and are involved in everyday humanaffairs. Offerings, entertainment, and attention will promote the development of a beneficialrelationship between people and the spirit world. But ignoring their presence or, worse yet, doingsomething to harm or offend them can have negative consequences, such as the loss of a crop,infertility, illness, or the death of a child.Because spirits live in the human world, they often reside in various physical objects—somenatural, others human-made. Places of special beauty or unusual characteristics, such as a sacredgrove or a waterfall, are said to be inhabited by spirits. Such places may also be considered9"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"190Chapter 9 • Gods and Spiritsdangerous. They may be venerated, and people will often travel to such places to seek solutions toproblems or to ask favors of the spirits. Unusual natural objects—such as a remarkable or strangestone or plant—may contain a spirit, as might a human-made object such as a statue or a shrine.Sometimes special structures are built and spirits are enticed to take up residence in them toprovide protection or good luck to the builder.The Dani View of the SupernaturalThe Dani live in the highlands of New Guinea, in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya. Thisdescription of spirits is based on a study of the Mulia Valley Dani.The study of Dani religion brings the paired concepts of emic and etic into clear focus(Chapter 1). Because the Dani themselves seldom articulate their belief system, it becomesexceedingly difficult for an outsider to learn about Dani religious practices from an insider, oremic, perspective. As is the case with many religions, to the outsider, Dani religion appears to beconfusing and illogical. Questions about rituals and beliefs are greeted either by silence or bythe familiar “That is just the way we do things” or “This is the way our fathers did it.” Sometimesthe question elicits a specific myth.An anthropologist, using an outsider or etic perspective, can attempt to understand theunderlying structure and logic of Dani beliefs and practices, although the Dani themselves mightnot understand or accept this structure and logic. For example, anthropologist Douglas JamesHayward notes that the Dani appear to organize their world into complementary pairs.1Theirphysical landscape is divided into cultivated and noncultivated land, and animals are divided intothose that live in association with people and those that do not. Their society is organized interms of a system in which all individuals are placed into one of two social groups that intermarrywith one another. Using the principle of complementary pairs, Hayward divides the Dani super-natural world into several categories by using three criteria: Are the beings physical or spirit?Are they beneficent or malevolent? Are they close or far away?The beings that inhabit the Dani world are either spirit or physical (“truly present”).Physical beings are mortal and are subject to the laws of nature. They include people, animals,and plants. Spirit beings are immortal and are not subject to the laws of nature. However, thisclassification does not necessarily correspond to our dichotomy between spirit and physical.For example, the sun is believed to be a real woman and thus a physical being, albeit one withunusual abilities.The identification of a being as beneficent or malevolent also is not as easy as it firstappears, for the categorization of a being as beneficent or malevolent often depends on context.For example, ghosts are spirits of the recently deceased that linger near the village in which theyonce lived, reluctant to leave. If the community fails to perform funeral rituals in a satisfactorymanner, the ghost becomes disappointed and may cause trouble for the community. Althoughghosts have a negative influence on Dani life, they also can be beneficent. Ghosts are consulted indivination ceremonies. They also warn the community of the approach of an enemy raiding party.The focus of Dani rituals is aimed at those spirit beings that live close by and play signifi-cant roles in their lives. This includes close beneficent spirits such as guardian spirits. Everyonehas a guardian spirit, but whereas boys are introduced to their spirits during initiation rituals,women never get to know their guardian spirits.An important group of close beneficent spirits is spirits associated with nature. Theseinclude forest spirits, rain spirits, and flood spirits. The weyaspirits control the rains. When theybecome violent, they send lightning storms, and trees that have been struck by lightning are"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits191evidence of their presence and power. However, they are classified as benevolent beings becausethey bring the rain.Included among the close malevolent spirits are forest spirits and swamp spirits. In theforest lurk male forest spirits who seduce women traveling alone through the forest. The forestalso contains female forest spirits, who seduce men by taking the form of their wives andgirlfriends. Sexual intercourse with such a spirit brings about death for the man (unless a pig hasbeen sacrificed) as well as the birth of a child that looks exactly like a human child but only hashalf a human soul.Many close malevolent spirits are associated with illnesses. These spirits often are identifiedwith particular animals. For example, a spirit associated with frogs causes illnesses characterizedby cold, clammy hands and feet; a spirit associated with owls bring about sore throats; and a spirit associated with lizards is responsible for the swelling of the limbs and joints.Remote malevolent spirits live in other people’s territories. They are a danger only whensomeone brings a spirit with him into Dani territory. When returning home from a journey, thetraveler closes the trail behind him by placing a “spirit restrainer,” composed of clumps of grasson sticks. The spirit cannot go beyond or around the restrainer and therefore cannot follow thetraveler home.Apart from the enemy, the only other malevolent nonspirit beings are a community of littlepeople who live in the sky. Being lazy, they stole food from their neighbors’ gardens rather thangrowing it themselves. They were finally driven out by the Dani and climbed into the sky.Eventually, they learned how to farm. However, these little people like to urinate on their formerenemies during rains. Men do not like to go out of doors on days when it is raining or misty.Guardian Spirits and the Native American Vision QuestAn important element in many Native American cultures is direct contact with supernaturalbeings and supernatural power. An example is the vision quest, in which the individual entersinto an altered state of consciousness, makes contact with the world of spirit beings, and receivesa gift of supernatural power. The spirit beings that are encountered in these visions are oftenreferred to as guardian spirits. An individual, usually male, may attempt to make contact with aguardian spirit either as part of a coming-of-age ritual or continually throughout his adult life, asa means of attaining protection, guidance, and identity. According to their worldview, it is onlythrough the attainment of this connection with the supernatural and the receipt of supernaturalpower that a person can be successful in life.Among the Ojibwa of the Great Lakes area, the vision quest is carried out at puberty.However, children begin preparing early in life with periodic fasting. They are given instructionin how to induce a vision and how to recognize and reject a bad vision. At the appropriate timethe boy is led into the forest to a platform that has been constructed in a tall pine tree. He is leftthere alone to fast until he receives his vision. The vision is interpreted as a journey into thesupernatural world. The boy is shown the path his life should take and the spirit beings who willbe his guardian spirits. He is also told of certain objects that he can acquire that will serve asphysical symbols of his relationship with the guardian spirits. After a successful vision quest theboy assumes the status of an adult man.Among the Wind River Shoshoni of Wyoming, vision quests are undertaken not just atpuberty, but throughout life. Supernatural power can be attained from guardian spirits in visionsand in dreams. In the vision quest the supplicant, usually male, rides to a place with rockdrawings in the foothills. After cleansing himself in a creek or lake, he goes to the rock ledge"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"192Chapter 9 • Gods and Spiritsbeneath the drawings. Naked except for a blanket, he waits for the vision. The vision is broughton by a combination of fasting, enduring the cold, sleep deprivation, and smoking tobacco. Whatis actually seen varies but commonly includes trials to be overcome before the spirit appears,often as an animal, to bestow supernatural power. The spirit frequently gives the man specificinstructions, such as wearing a special item or avoiding certain people or behaviors. For example,a deer spirit that gives the gift of speed while running might instruct the man to wear a deer tailsewn on his clothes or on a ribbon around his neck. Among the Shoshoni, a man can acquireseveral guardian spirits to aid him.JinnThe Qur’an tells of God’s creation of three types of conscious beings: humans made from clay,angelsmade from light, and jinnmade from fire without smoke. Jinn are normally invisible, butthey can make themselves visible, and in doing so, they often take the form of a human or ananimal. Once visible, they can alter their shape and features at will. Jinn are born, live, anddie; they marry, mate, and have families. Some have great powers; others do not. Many are specifically known and named; others occur as a part of an unnamed collective of spirits. Likepeople, jinn have different personalities, some good and some bad. They may lie and deceivepeople; they enjoy playing tricks and kidnapping people; and they often tempt humans intosexual intercourse.Sometimes a person can forge a special relationship with a jinn, and then the jinn becomesa source of special powers. For example, a person can enter into an alliance with a jinn andbecome a powerful magician. The Genii of the Aladdin story is a jinn, and the stories of theArabian Nightsare largely stories involving jinn. But generally, people try to keep a distancebetween themselves and jinn because, more often than not, jinn are troublemakers. People willfrequently recite verses from the Qur’an or avoid situations that attract the attention of jinn. Thisis the origin of many tabus surrounding blood, childbirth, and marriage, because these aresituations that are very attractive to jinn. The very existence of jinn causes people to be careful,yet they also provide an explanation for illness and bad luck.SPIRIT POSSESSION IN THE SUDAN.Anthropologist Janice Boddy describes the presence ofjinn in the small Arabic-speaking village of Hofriyat in the northern Sudan.2The Hofriyatirecognize three types of jinn. White jinn have little effect on humans, whereas black jinn, ordevils, are dangerous, and possession by black jinn often leads to serious illness and death.However, the most frequently encountered are red jinn called zairan(singular: zar). The redcolor symbolizes an association with blood and fertility. Zairanare capable of causing illness.Such illnesses must be dealt with, but they are seldom fatal.The world of the zairanparallels the world of humans. Zairanbelong to different religions,occupations, and ethnic groups, and they exhibit a range of behaviors, some good and some bad.In other words, they are very much like humans, mixing both good and bad traits, but generallythey tend to be amoral and capricious. The Hofriyati recognize jinn that are identified asrepresenting diverse ethnic and social groups. Some are Europeans, West Africans, Ethiopians,Arabs, and so forth, representing outside groups with which they have had contact in the past.Yet there are no zairanwho resemble the Hofriyati themselves.Spirit possession occurs when a zarenters the body of a woman. Most possessionoccurs in women of childbearing age, and close to half of the adult women in the communityare possessed. In these communities the life of a woman is very restricted. Physically, she"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits193remains within the high walls of the family compound, where she is segregated from the men,eating and even sleeping in separate quarters. Her worth and happiness depend on her fertilityand her ability to produce sons. The production of sons and their survival are women’s tasks, andmen are not to blame in the case of failure. A woman who does not have children, miscarries, orhas only daughters or whose children die young is accorded a very low position in the society.She may be divorced by her husband or may have to accept a co-wife in the marriage.Therefore there is a great deal of anxiety in marriage, and this anxiety often leads todepression. In this case a woman may be possessed by a zar.However, it also is possible that thezaris responsible for the misfortune surrounding her reproductive life. Once the zarhas enteredher body, she will continue to be possessed from that time on.Although zarpossession is a lifelong condition, it would not be accurate to describe thispossession as an illness. During ceremonies each zaris drummed into each woman in turn; thewoman then goes into a trance. Through this relationship the woman regains a measure of well-being, although she must constantly pay attention to the wishes of the spirit by attendingpossession ceremonies on a regular basis. The possessed woman must also meet certain demandsof the spirit. She must eat certain foods, wear gold and clean clothing, avoid anger, and manifestother ideal feminine behaviors. As long as the relationship continues, the woman will maintain a“cure.” From the spirit’s point of view, this relationship gives it access to the human world. Onceit possesses its host, the zarwill be entertained and can engage in various activities.When she is not possessed, a woman will participate in singing and drumming. Such all-female rituals provide an important outlet for otherwise isolated women. They are much morethan curing rituals and are also enjoyable social events in a world where such social activities arerelatively rare.Christian Angels and DemonsAngels and demons are spirit beings that appear in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In thesemonotheistic religions angels act as mediators between God and human beings. Angels are oftenrepresented as agents of revelation, executors of divine will, or as witnesses to divine activity.Angels appear in both Greek and Jewish writings but tend to play a limited role. In the NewTestament of Christianity, angels are frequently mentioned. (“And there appeared an angel untohim from heaven, strengthening him” [Luke 22:43].)However, much of the popular Christian belief about angels comes not from the Bible, butfrom the sixth-century writings of Saint Dionysus. In his work The Celestial Hierarchy,he established a rank order of angels that included, in descending order, seraphim, cherubim,thrones, dominations, virtues, powers, principalities, archangels, and angels. Belief in angels iswidespread in modern U.S. society. A poll conducted in 2007 found that 68 percent of thosesurveyed believe that angels and demons are active in the world.3Despite these numbers, there islittle consensus on exactly what angels are or how they look. Descriptions range from a glowinglight to a very human appearance, or perhaps the presence of the angel is felt but not seen. Ingeneral, angels are said to appear to help people in need, often as workers or messengers of God.At the other end of the spectrum are demons. Although frequent mention is made ofdemons in the Christian Bible, no one passage gives a full account of their creation or workings.However, several Church writings have been published that clarify the subject, such as the decreesof the Fourth Lateran Council from the Catholic Church in 1215. Here it says that both the Deviland the demons were originally angelic creatures, created by God as good, innocent beings.They became evil by their own actions. Satan and his minions rebelled against God and, after a"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"194Chapter 9 • Gods and Spiritsbattle with the good angels, were cast from heaven. Satan and the demons are believed to beclosely associated with human evil, including the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden andtheir dominion over hell.One common activity of demons, as described in the New Testament, is demonic possession.This was considered a major cause of strange behaviors by humans and much of Jesus’ healingministry involved performing demonic exorcism.In the period roughly between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, Christian demonologyreached its peak. Beliefs about demons were elaborated and had much social influence. Ornatedoctrines were produced detailing the hierarchies, invocation, methods, and exorcism of demons.This was the era of the infamous Witchcraze (see Chapter 10), during which there was a particularinterest in incubiand succubae. Incubi and succubae are, respectively, male and female demonswho have sex with humans while they sleep. Sex with an incubus was said to be responsible for thebirth of demons, witches, and deformed children.The belief in demonic possession is still common today among conservative Christians,both Catholic and Protestant. For many of these groups a belief in the inerrancy of the Biblerequires a belief in demons and demonic exorcism, because they are mentioned so frequently inthe New Testament. See Box 9.1 for a discussion of Christian exorcism.GODSGenerally speaking, gods are more powerful than spirits. They possess great supernatural powerand control or influence major forces of nature, such as the wind, rain, and fertility. Gods arepersonalized individuals with names, origins, and specific attributes. Some gods are associatedwith social and political units such as clans and villages. The number of gods found within areligious system varies from one to more than a thousand.BOX 9.1Christian Demonic Exorcism in the United StatesPossession as a source of illness that requires exorcism for healing is found cross-culturally, includ-ing in the United States. As is discussed in this chapter, the Christian belief in demons and demon-ic exorcism is taken directly from the New Testament. There we learn that Satan and his demonsharass, torment, and possess humans. This possession sometimes is shown in new skills or strengththat the person then has (by virtue of the demon). In general, possession was described as anillness, and much of Jesus’ healing ministry involved performing demonic exorcism. In the NewTestament, Jesus is able to perform exorcisms by merely demanding that the demons leave; hisdisciples do the same in the name of Jesus. (“And in the synagogue there was a man, which had aspirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, Saying, Let us alone; what have we to dowith thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; theHoly One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And whenthe devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not” [Luke 4:33–37]).In his book American Exorcism: Expelling Demons in the Land of Plenty,Michael Cuneoargues that the phenomenon of Christian demonic exorcism is both influenced by and reflectswider American culture. For example, he cites the great influence of the book and later film The"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits195Exorcistin the early 1970s. Following the release of The Exorcistand other popular books, the re-ported incidence of demonic possession and requests for exorcism greatly increased. The film de-picted a specifically Catholic event. However, official Catholic exorcisms were—and are—difficultto come by. Although the Catholic Church does believe in demonic possession and the need forexorcisms, these are seen as rare events. The priest is advised to be skeptical and look for othercauses first, such as mental illness. The exorcism ritual can be officially performed only with per-mission of a bishop.However, some exorcisms were available through unofficial channels, particularly priests whodo not agree with the modernization of the church following the Second Vatican Council in the early1960s and among charismatic Catholics. In the 1970s and 1980s, exorcism rituals also became pop-ular in other Christian religions, particularly among people belonging to a religious movement calledneo-Pentecostalism or the charismatic renewal. In general, members of this movement were seekinga more personal and dramatic religious experience. This experience was called baptism in the HolySpirit and was believed to be associated with various spiritual gifts (or charisms), such as speaking intongues, prophesy, and healing. Part of this healing was exorcisms—or deliverance ministries, as theywere often called. The demons involved were often personal demons such as demons of lust, anger,resentment, and addiction, as well as demons of specific illnesses, such as cancer.Exorcism also became popular with certain groups of evangelical Protestants, particularly inthe early 1980s. Cuneo estimates that there are at least 500–600 evangelical exorcism ministriestoday and that the number might even be two or three times this amount.Cuneo points out that the exorcism movement fits in very well with other cultural ideas thatwere popular in the late twentieth century in the United States. Like other self-help regimens andtherapies of the era, the exorcism movement teaches that people are victims and not responsible for thebad things in their lives. Demons are to blame in much the same way that more mainstream therapiesblame the ubiquitous “dysfunctional family.” Cuneo writes, “Exorcism may be a strange therapy, itmay be the crazy uncle of therapies, but it’s therapy nonetheless. And no less than any of the count-less other therapies in the therapy-mad culture of post-sixties America, it promises liberation for theaddicted, hope for the forlorn, solace for the brokenhearted. It promises a new and redeemed self, aself freed from the accumulated debris of a life badly lived or a life sadly endured.”aAs was said in Chapter 4, religious healing can be very effective, and this is often the casewith exorcism as well. From an outsider’s perspective the ritual attention paid to the afflictedperson alone is likely to be helpful.aM. Cuneo, American Exorcism: Expelling Demons in the Land of Plenty(New York: Doubleday, 2001),p. 273.Gods are anthropomorphic; that is, they resemble people in their physical appearance andpersonalities. They are born, marry, and sometimes die. They love and lust, are wise and dull,loving and hateful, generous and miserly. Some are sympathetic to human beings; others arehostile. And like humans, gods can be influenced by gifts in the form of offerings and sacrificesand by praise and flattery, and sometimes they can be tricked.The behavior of humans on earth reflects the orders and commandments of the gods. Godsset up codes of behavior and punish people who do not observe them. They may prescribe thatcertain ritual activities be performed and bring down misfortune when they are not. Some godsare very concerned about the fate of human beings and will establish close relationships withthem and have a great influence in human lives.BOX 9.1(Continued)"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"196Chapter 9 • Gods and SpiritsUranus = GaeaCronus = RheaDemeter = Zeus = LetoZeus = MaiaZeus = DioneHermesAphroditeIapetusCoeus = PhoebeOceanus = TethysMountainsPontusHestiaPersephoneApollo Artemis Atlas Prometheus EpithetheusPoseidonChaosGaeaTartarusErosErebusHadesZeus = HeraAthenaAresHebe HephaestusFIGURE 9.1The Greek Pantheon.This diagram portrays the relationships among the better knowngods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon. Unlike human families, gods and goddesses are able tomarry brother to sister and to produce children without a mate.Types of GodsWithin a particular religious system, the gods as a collective make up a pantheon. Usually, thegods within the pantheon form a hierarchy with a supreme godat the top. They are related toone another in various ways, often making up a large family unit characterized by familyrelationships, such as those seen in the Greek pantheon (Figure 9.1). The community of the godsoften mirrors human society. If the human society is highly hierarchical and warlike, so is thesociety of the gods.In many ways a pantheon resembles a human society, often with a division of labor.Specific gods are associated with the forces of nature, human fertility and the human life cycle,economic activities, and war. Specialized deities are called attribute gods. The relativeimportance of such gods depends largely on the importance of various activities within humansociety. For example, if a society is very warlike, the war gods may be featured prominently inreligious rituals.The gods within a pantheon have specific spheres of influence and control. Sometimesthere is a relatively small number of gods, each controlling a rather large slice of human activity.Sometimes there are a great many gods, each highly specialized. For example, instead of a singlegod associated with agriculture, the Roman pantheon had a rather lengthy list of gods who wereresponsible for very specific activities within the farming cycle (Table 9.1).Although there is a tremendous variety of gods that can be listed, certain types seem toappear over and over as we move from society to society. Creator godsare responsible for thecreation of the physical earth and the plants and animals that live on it. Creator gods can be verypowerful deities and often occupy the top rung of a hierarchy of gods. Creation is not necessari-ly the work of a single god. Often various aspects of creation are divided among several gods, or,usually after the creation of the physical earth, different gods are responsible for the creation of"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits197TABLE 9.1The Roman Gods and Goddesses of AgricultureDeityResponsibilitySeiaThe sprouting of the seedSegestaThe shoots coming through the soilProserpinaForms the stalksNodotusForms sections of the stemVolutinaForms protective sheath around seedsPatelanaLater removes sheath around seedsLacturnus and MatutaRipening of grain (at two stages)FloraMakes plant blossomspecific types of plants and animals or the plants and animals that occupy a particular area. Thisincludes the creation of people.However, sometimes the creator god creates the world and then withdraws from activeinteractions with the world. These otiose godsare too remote and too uninterested in humanactivities to participate in the activities and fate of humans. Therefore rituals are seldomperformed to influence and to ask favors from such gods. Sometimes these gods maintain interestin humans through lesser, intermediary deities.A common form of supernatural being found in cultures in many diverse areas is thetrickster. Ambiguity is one of its major characteristics, which often makes it difficult to define.Most often male, the trickster is able to transform himself into a series of beings—human,animal, and deity. The various parts of his body may detach themselves or be severed fromthe body. In some trickster stories he is seemingly destroyed by being burned, crushed, ordisemboweled—yet he is able to reassemble himself. Often the trickster is a creator who isresponsible for bringing many technologies, customs, and activities into the world, such as fire,healing, and magic. Although on the one hand he is powerful, courageous, and creative, he isalso vindictive, selfish, cowardly, and destructive. Perhaps his two most frequently mentionedcharacteristics are gluttony and lust; he has a voracious appetite for food and sex. He is alwaysfinding ways to find and steal food and is never sexually satisfied. Among the best-knowntricksters are those of North America, such as Raven, Coyote, and Hare. (Box 2.5 tells a storyof the Haida trickster.)The trickster figure plays a number of roles in human societies. The stories point outhuman frailties through satire, because the trickster represents the antithesis of what it is to behuman and places human society in its position in an environment that is not always stable andpredictable. Sam Gill writes, “In Trickster is embodied the human struggle against the confine-ment felt by being bound to place, even with the obvious necessity of such definition in order toprevent chaos. In many of his adventures, Trickster permits people to experience the vicariousthrills and freedoms of a utopian existence. But his folly reveals the very meaning of the bound-aries that give order to human life.”4The trickster may also find a place in situations of contactand social conflict. In San society the trickster is frequently seen as a participant in society whoflouts society’s rules. In many stories the trickster finds himself interacting with the nonnative,dominant population, in which case the stories become protest and resistance stories in whichsocial situations are reversed and the trickster outwits the dominant individual."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"198Chapter 9 • Gods and SpiritsGods and SocietyÉmile Durkheim first proposed the idea that religious symbolism marks as sacred importantinstitutions of human society that are necessary for the group’s survival.5Durkheim’sapproach is a functionalist one, seeing religious and other cultural phenomena as serving someessential purpose in maintaining the society. In his analysis of gods, he points out that thepowers commonly attributed to gods are similar to those of society: creating sacred times andspaces, designating moral rules and punishing offenders, existing above all individuals,requiring sacrifice. Values that we learn in society, such as obligation, loyalty, respect, andhierarchy, are mirrored in our relationship with supernatural beings.The imagery that is used for gods, such as their anthropomorphic nature, is taken fromsocial categories and statuses. Gods are rulers, fathers, mothers, daughters, and sons. We relateto them through social interactions in ways learned in society. Whatever the themes are in aparticular culture will be reflected in the nature and domains of the gods. The values and con-cerns of a culture are projected onto the gods themselves, and the behavior of humans towardthe gods is an expression of the social behaviors valued by that culture.In a similar vein, British anthropologist Robin Horton suggests that supernatural beingsfunction to extend the realm of social relations.6Again, the focus is on gods as anthropomorphicbeings who reflect human behavior. Horton suggests that the behavior of the gods provides amodel for humans. He explored his ideas by looking at various African religions. Although ahigh god is found in almost all of these religions, the nature of this god ranges from an otiose godto one who is in active control of the universe. Horton thought that two variables explain much ofthis variation.The first variable is how often people in that society encounter other peoples and the worldin general outside their own local community. Horton thinks that lesser gods are associated withthe interpretation of events occurring in the immediate area while a high god is more importantfor interpreting that immediate world in relation to the greater world beyond the local area. Withthis greater level of contact, issues that people face are more likely to be seen as being part of justbeing human. Thus the greater the contact a society has with the larger world, the greater theneed for a high god who has universal features and is associated with humanity in general ratherthan just with a local group.The second variable proposed by Horton was the degree to which an individual’s statusin the society is ascribedor achieved. An ascribed status is one that is given to an individualbased on attributes over which they have no control, such as gender and family line. Hortonproposed that because an individual’s status is determined solely by the community, ideaswill focus on lesser gods who themselves are focused on local issues. In contrast, if status isbased on an individual’s personal achievements, the individual is, at least in part, independentfrom the community. Therefore explanations of personal success and failure are more likelyto reference a high god who rules over a wider realm.Horton suggests that these variables help to explain the openness of Africa to Islamand Christianity. He correlates the arrival of missionaries in Africa with the opening upof local communities to the wider world and an increase in emphasis on achieved versusascribed status.The functionalist perspective was also tested in a 1974 study by Guy Swanson.7In thestudy, Swanson looked at fifty different societies to see whether social characteristics of a groupare predictive of their religious beliefs. Here we will look at two of the predictions he tested thatconcern the number and nature of supernatural beings."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits199BOX 9.2Games and GodsAmong the many expressions of a culture’s worldview are the games that are played. For example,are games of chance favored over games of strategy? Do games rely on physical skills or onmental skills? These and other characteristics of games are associated with particular features of aculture. Here we will look at the connection between games and religion.John Roberts, Malcolm Arth, and Robert Rush classified games into three categories: games ofstrategy, games of chance, and games of physical skill. They found that games of chance, such asdice games, are associated with religious activities. On the simplest level, success at a game ofchance may be attributed to aid received from the supernatural, either magical in nature or throughsupernatural beings. The authors argue that games of chance are “exercises in relationships with thesupernatural.” They tested this idea by looking at the nature of supernatural beings in societieswhere games of chance were the most prevalent type of game played. The dimensions they exploredincluded how aggressive or how benevolent supernatural forces were seen to be and how easy itwas to coerce these beings. They hypothesized that gods in these societies would be seen as morebenevolent than aggressive and as being relatively easy to coerce. The hypothesis was upheld in theirsample of societies. As an interesting side note, the lack of reference to games of chance in theHebrew Bible suggests that this God was more aggressive than benevolent and not easily coerced.The study concluded that “games of strategy may be related to mastery of the socialsystem; games of chance may be linked with mastery of the supernatural; and games of physicalskill are possibly associated with the mastery both of self and of environment.”Source:John M. Roberts, Malcolm J. Arth, and Robert R. Rush, “Games in Culture,” AmericanAnthropologist,61 (1959), pp. 597–605.First, Swanson looked at religious systems in which there is a high or supreme god who ishigher than all other supernatural beings. In Swanson’s study, this could be either the only god inthe system or the ruler of a pantheon of gods. The essential element was that this god rules over ahierarchy with at least two levels of supernatural beings below it. Swanson reasoned that, on thebasis of Durkheim’s work, such a religious hierarchy was more likely to be found in a society thatalso had a decision-making hierarchy that contained at least three different levels. In a kin-basedsociety, for example, this could include families, lineages, and clans (a lineage contains manyfamilies, and a clan contains two or more lineages). His study supported this hypothesis. Thebelief in a supreme god was found in 78 percent of societies with three levels and 91 percent ofthose with four or more levels but in only 11 percent with only one or two levels.Swanson also looked at polytheistic systems in which no one god is considered to besupreme. Although they are superior to spirits, each god rules over a particular domain, and noneis superior to another. Because these gods are attribute gods, Swanson realized that the presenceof this type of god would be connected to the degree of specialization in a society. He found thatthe number of specialists is positively correlated with the number of such gods.Sigmund Freud (Chapter 1) and psychosocial anthropologists have a similar perspective.For example, Freud thought that religion as a whole can be seen as a symbolic expression of"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"200Chapter 9 • Gods and Spiritsrelationships between children and their parents.8This can especially be seen in the nature ofgods. We think about nature anthropomorphically, and so there is a god of thunder, a god of themountains, a god of the river, and so on. We then project human qualities, particularly those ofparents, onto them. For example, if parents are punitive, so are the gods; if parents are indul-gent, so are the gods.The Gods of the YorubaIn Chapter 3 we examined the color naming system of the Yoruba and how it applies to thedeities called the orisha.The Yoruba live in the southwestern region of Nigeria and the Republicof Benin in West Africa. Through the slave trade and more recently immigration, Yoruba culturehas spread into the New World. Theirs is an ancient culture, and their religious conceptsare found throughout a number of city-states, each associated with a particular urban center.The urban center of Ife is of special importance, for it was here that the first acts of creation wereperformed. It was here that Olodumare sent the gods to create the earth.The Yoruba cosmos is divided into two realms: Orun, heaven or sky, and Aiye, the earth,the realm of the living. Residing in Orun is the Creator Olodumare, gods known as the orisha,and the ancestors. Olorun is the high god and the source of all supernatural power, but he isremote from the people and is not approached in rituals, an example of an otiose god. He iscontacted through the intermediaries, the orisha.There are a large number of orisha.Some are acknowledged throughout the Yoruba region;others are associated with a particular region, village, or even family group. The orishaare anthro-pomorphic and display human emotions. They are not inherently good or evil, but manifestcomplex behaviors and can act in a good or evil way, depending on the situation and the context.The orishamake themselves known through possessing a devotee, who then moves in a character-istic manner associated with the god. The person will also wear special clothing and hold certainobjects. Worship of particular deities is associated with shrines and altars that contain objects thatare placed there to please the gods and to show one’s devotion. The orishaare examples of attributegods. Each is approached in ritual because of a particular problem. Table 9.2 lists the best known ofthe orisha.The Gods of the IfugaoThe Ifugao are a mountain-dwelling people living in the western mountains of Luzon in thePhilippines (Southeast Asia culture area). They were studied by R. F. Barton in the early part ofthe twentieth century.9The Ifugao are well known as a culture with one of the largest knownpantheons. Barton listed 1,240 deities but believed that there were as many as 1,500. These deitiesare grouped into forty classes, although the classification is quite inconsistent. Yet the Ifugao haveno supreme or creator deity. Like most supernatural beings, Ifugao deities are immortal; they areoften invisible; they are able to change their shape; and they can transport themselves instantlythrough space. Although the deities can be grouped by their characteristics and powers, each doeshave its own specific place in the pantheon. Just as in the world of humans, the best way to getalong with the gods is to bribe them. A prayer without a sacrifice is useless because the sacrificeis treated as a payment.As an example, one of the classes is translated as the “Paybackables.” The name is derivedfrom a word used for a payment in an economic exchange. The Ifugao believe that they used tohave trading relations with these deities in the past and have received from the deities a great dealof their culture. This is the largest of the classes and includes a rather broad range of deities,"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits201TABLE 9.2Some of the Yoruba OrishaOrishaDomainCharacteristicsSymbolic RepresentationEsu-Elegba“Guardian of theThreshold,” first god to be addressed in ritual;intermediary betweenpeople, their ancestors, andthe godsUnpredictable, tricksterHooked beaded stick; red and blackObatalaKing of the orishaEthical, merciful,patient, composedWhite sheet, white beaded cane; whiteOgunRules over metal,technology, and warAggressive, boldBeaded machete, metalimplements; green and dark blueOrisa OkoAgricultural deity, judgesantisocial behavior, disease,and poverty, interprets IfadivinationIron beaded staffs, flutesOsanyinForest deity and god ofherbalistic medicineRepresented as a puppet with asqueaky voice, iron staff toppedwith birds; colors of the forestOsoosiHunter godQuick, strong,aggressive, intellectualHunter’s hat, powder horns,bow and arrow; green and blueOsunGoddess of freshwaterstreams; sustains lifeYoungest orisha,beautiful and vain,deceitfulRound fan, crown and beadedapron; crystal yellow gold toopaque chartreuseSangoGod of thunder andlightningProud, aggressive,quick temperedDouble-bladed axe, gourd rattle,zigzag motif representinglightningYemojaRuler of the river Ogun,mother of many orisha,symbol of motherhoodCalm, serious, dignifiedRound fan, crown; crystal whiteand crystal blue or greenincluding nature gods, deified heroes and ancestors, and technological gods.

The loan isusually very difficult to get repaid, and the Ifugao have developed many behaviors, includingbullying and bluffing, to get the loan repaid. For example, if a debtor has publicly refused to paya debt and therefore cannot pay it without losing face, the one to whom the debt is owed will callon the god Amobok, who will weaken the debtor’s resolve and get him to pay back the debt insecret, thereby saving face.There are many other important classes of deities. These include gods of reproduction,messenger deities, gods associated with various illnesses, gods associated with death, divinationdeities, gods of war, guardians of property, and many, many more.GoddessesGoddesses have been important figures in many religious systems. Some scholars believe thatearly human religions centered on fertility, a lunar cycle as opposed to a solar one, and theworship of a goddess. This is largely speculative and based on findings of small carvings offemale figures with exaggerated characteristics thought to be connected to fertility (Figure 9.2)."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits203Although matriarchy, or rule by women, may never have existed in the past, the role of women inthese prehistoric foraging societies was almost certainly greater than that in contemporaryagricultural and industrial societies.Some believe that goddess worship continued in Europe until a few thousand years beforethe Common Era. At this time the Indo-Europeans invaded from the East and brought with thema belief in male gods and the exploitation of nature. Some argue that goddess worship and thenew god worship gradually combined to produce the polytheistic pagan religions of the Romans,Greeks, and Celts.With the development of the monotheistic religions, discussed later in the chapter, thegoddess was further suppressed, as these latter religions conceived of god in largely male terms.Although all three of the monotheistic religions contained some egalitarian sentiments in theirorigins and texts, all have also been interpreted at one time or another in very misogynistic terms.Three important goddesses are Ishtar of the ancient Near East, Isis of ancient Egypt, andKali in Hinduism. We will also discuss the Virgin Mary in Catholicism, although her classificationas a goddess is certainly debatable and comes entirely from an etic perspective. Goddess worshiphas also seen a resurgence with the growth of the Wiccan religion, which will be discussed inChapter 11.ISHTAR (ANCIENT NEAR EAST).The goddess Ishtar was worshipped for thousands of years inMesopotamia. Seen as both invincible in battle and a source of fertility, Ishtar was one of theparamount national deities.In the natural environment of Mesopotamia, winds, rain, drought, and flood were allcommon. This contributed to a worldview in which these inconsistencies in nature were seen asbeing a reflection of violent conflicts among the gods; both the environment and the gods wereseen as being unpredictable. The only way to ensure adequate food, victory in warfare, health,and so on was proper performance of rituals and sacrifices for the gods and goddesses.Among the gods and goddesses in the pantheon, Ishtar is supreme in her power over fate,as recounted in the Epic of Gilgamesh. In this story Ishtar made sexual advances toward KingGilgamesh, which he rejected. In response, Ishtar asked the supreme god, An, to send the bullof heaven to destroy Gilgamesh and his city, Uruk. Ishtar threatened that if she did not get herway, she would release the dead from the netherworld. In her role as a fertility goddess,she also promised that she would ensure that there would be enough food to eat after the bull’sdestruction.Sexuality was an important aspect of Ishtar, as seen in the sacred marriage rites. Therites took place between the king and an avatarof Ishtar, probably her high priestess. Unlikethe Egyptian pharaohs, who were themselves seen as divine, this king was seen as a mortalwho was the intermediary between the community and the gods. His relationship with Ishtarwas seen as the source of his power and the guarantee of his success. This union wasexplicitly sexual, although it resulted not in offspring, but in the fertility of the land andsuccess in battle.ISIS (ANCIENT EGYPT).Women occupied a relatively favorable position in ancient Egyptiansociety. The pharaoh was seen as the son of the sun god, and his queen was not only consort tothe divine king but the mother of the divine prince. Women were also important in the religiousrealm, the pantheon containing a number of prominent goddesses.Isis was probably the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon for the averageEgyptian. She was called the “Great Mother” and the “Queen of Heaven” and was associated"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"204Chapter 9 • Gods and Spiritswith family. Her most common representation was as a mother, seated, suckling her son Horuson her lap. It is as the devoted wife and sister of Osiris and mother of Horus that she was bestknown.Although Isis was originally closely associated with the royalty, she became associatedwith nature as her significance grew and became diversified. Her influence spread; she waspresent in Rome and Greece. Around 300 B.C.E. the religion of Isis had developed into a mysteryreligionthat involved secret and sacred rites. One had to be initiated into the religion to gain thewisdom and salvation that the goddess could offer. The influence of Isis peaked during the thirdcentury C.E., when her popularity made her a serious competitor to the Christian church.KALI (HINDUISM).The worship of a feminine aspect of the divine has a long history in India,probably dating back to pre-Vedic ancient peoples. (The Vedas are religious texts that arethe foundation of much of modern Hinduism. They were written down by the middle of the firstmillennium B.C.E., although they had existed in oral form much earlier.) The goddess remainsimportant today. She is often associated with creativity and nature, in particular great treesand rivers.The goddess is worshipped in many forms, including Durga, associated with ultimate lightand benevolent power, and Kali, who is the divine in its fierce form. Kali means the “Black One,”and she is depicted as dark skinned and naked, standing on a corpse, dripping with blood, andcarrying a sword and a severed head. She wears a girdle of severed hands and a necklace ofskulls (Figure 9.3). Kali is said to have an insatiable thirst for blood, and at her temples animalsare beheaded as a sacrifice to her.Despite this fierce appearance, Kali is not evil. Although she is a fearsome destroyer tothose who do evil, she is the loving and compassionate mother to her devotees. In Hinduism thedivine is seen as encompassing both creation and destruction. Death and birth are linked togetherin an endless cycle.Kali symbolizes transformation. The sword that she carries is used to cut away impedimentsto the realization of truth. Her garland consists of fifty severed heads to represent the fifty lettersof the Sanskrit alphabet. Thus the garland represents knowledge and wisdom. The hands are theprincipal means by which work is done and therefore symbolize the action of karma. The handshave been severed, showing that the binding effects of karma have been overcome. Kali blessesthe devotee by cutting him or her free from the cycle of karma.Kali is often depicted as dancing wildly with the god Shiva. Shiva is sometimes known asthe Lord of the Dance and, like Kali, is known as destructive and horrific. Some stories describetheir dancing as threatening to destroy the world with its savage power. Gradually, Kali becameknown as one of Shiva’s chief spouses. In art she is often shown standing or dancing on hisnaked and prostrate body. As she dances, her energy flows into him and brings him life. Thisimage of Shiva and Kali shows Shiva as the passive potential of creation and Kali as his Shakti,or feminine creative principle.MARY (ROMAN CATHOLIC).Christianity is a monotheistic religion and, as such, cannot besaid from an emic perspective to have a goddess. However, throughout Christian history, Maryhas played an important role, and devotion to her has developed in different ways.The height of devotion to Mary occurred during the medieval and baroque periods in the mod-ern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions. Although Mary was never described as a goddess, shewas held in such high esteem that she was certainly seen as more than merely a woman. She was"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits205FIGURE 9.3The Hindu Goddess Kali.A fierce goddess, Kali destroys thosewho do evil, but also brings wisdomand transformation to her devotees.set above the saints and, as the mother of God’s son, was seen as only a little lower than God.She played an important role as an intermediary between people and God and Jesus. This wasnot true of the Protestant religions, which have tended to minimize the place of Mary. In fact,devotion to Mary was one of the major issues of the Protestant Reformation.In the book of Revelation a passage that is interpreted as referring to Mary describes her as“a woman, clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelvestars” (Revelation 12:1). This woman is also said to be stepping on a serpent, which is seen assymbolic of Mary overcoming the curse brought on humans by the first woman, Eve. In thelanguage of Revelation, Mary is the “Queen of Heaven.”The importance of Mary is shown in many different ways. First is the celebration, not only ofthe Annunciation when the Archangel Gabriel told Mary she would bear the Son of God, but alsoof Mary’s birth and death. She is shown in countless works of art, and many churches have beendedicated in her name. Shrines and pilgrimage sites associated with Mary were found not only inmedieval Christianity, but in modern times. Examples are pilgrimage sites at Lourdes in France,Guadalupe in Mexico, and Fatima in Portugal, at each of which an apparition of Mary occurred."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"206Chapter 9 • Gods and SpiritsSimilarities between Mary and some of the Near Eastern pagan goddesses have also beennoted. (For example, Isis is also referred to as “Great Mother” and “Queen of Heaven” and isdepicted seated and holding her son.) Mary fits nicely into the role of these goddesses as protec-tors and sustainers. Some researchers think that devotion to Mary is actually derived from earlier worship of the Mother Goddess. Despite the fact that technically, all Mary can do is offerintercession for the protection of God, she is often directly addressed for protection. If not agoddess, Mary certainly plays an important role in the Christian understanding of God.Monotheism: Conceptions of God in Judaism, Christianity, and IslamMost of the religions that we have discussed and most religions that have existed in the worldhave been polytheistic;that is, they recognize many deities. However, most people in the UnitedStates are more familiar with the monotheistic(a belief in one god) religions of Judaism,Christianity, and Islam. These three religions share some of the same history in addition to theconcept of a single God. All three have also had to struggle with the philosophical issues inher-ent in a belief in only one God, particularly one that is seen as omnipotent(all-powerful),omniscient(all-knowing), and omnibenevolent(all-good). These include the problem of recon-ciling an omniscient God with human free will and reconciling an all-good and omnipotent godwith the existence of evil. We will now examine a little of the history of these three religions andhow they have conceived of the nature of God.10JUDAISM.The ultimate theme of Judaism is monotheism. Judaism believes that the Jews havebeen chosen by God to enter into a special relationship with Him, much like that of child toparent. However, many scholars argue that we should not assume that the earliest Jews—forexample, the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—were in fact monotheists.The patriarchs appear to have shared many of the religious beliefs of their pagan neighbors in Canaan and might not have even shared the same god among themselves. Manydifferent names are used for God in the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh). Some scholars argue thatthese were actually names of different gods. For example, the god of Abraham might havebeen El, the high god of Canaan. The name Yahwehis also used, and he is called the “God ofour Fathers” by the Israelites. However, Yahweh might have been a different God from El.When Moses made the covenant with God on Mount Sinai, the Israelites agreed to worshipYahweh alone. The covenant did not say that Yahweh is the only god who exists, although thatconcept developed later. Even the Ten Commandments take the existence of other gods for granted,such as in the commandment that “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3).Worship of a single god while ignoring the others was an unusual step in a polytheisticworld, in which it was dangerous to ignore possible sources of supernatural power and theIsraelites were often reluctant to make this move, despite the covenant. It appears that Yahwehhad been a warrior god and was very helpful in such matters, but He was not seen as a specialistin other areas, such as fertility. When the Israelites settled in Canaan, they turned to the cult ofBaal, the Canaanite fertility god, for such matters. It was difficult for the masculine Yahweh toreplace goddesses such as Ishtar and Asherah, who still had a great following among theIsraelites, especially among the women.The Tanakh tells that the people had become so corrupt and idolatrous that God permittedthe King of Assyria to successfully invade the country. Later, Jerusalem was captured, theTemple in Jerusalem was destroyed, and the people were taken to exile in Babylonia. This was animportant turning point in Jewish history as they came to realize that they could practice their"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits207religion away from the Temple. From this grew the idea of a more pure monotheism, thatYahweh is the only God. In many ways the monotheism of the Jews was different from the paganreligions around it. The other gods of the ancient Middle East, such as Baal and Marduk, werenot involved in the everyday lives of the people. The God of Israel, however, was an importantpower in human lives and was intimately involved in the ongoing history of the Jewish people.The pagan religions were generally tribal, limited to a specific people and a specific place. TheGod of Israel promised that he would protect Jacob and his people when they left Canaan andtraveled to a strange new land. This conception of God was very pragmatic.The way in which God is characterized changes over time in the Tanakh. In the story ofAbraham, God, described in a very anthropomorphic way, visited Abraham in his tent and shareda meal with him. Later in time, God appeared to Moses in the much more dramatic form of aburning bush and insisted on distance. Later prophets were visited by angelic messengers, orsometimes they heard a divine inner voice. In the later rabbinic tradition God was presented aseven more transcendent and even less anthropomorphic.The early stories of God depict Him as a very partisan tribal deity, often cruel and violent.He demanded the sacrifice of Abraham’s son Isaac, and He visited horrific plagues on theEgyptians. Later He was transformed into a symbol of transcendence and compassion, and in allthree of the monotheistic religions discussed in this section, God became an inspiration for socialjustice.In the years after the destruction of the second temple by the Romans in 70 C.E., the rabbisdescribed God as an essentially subjective experience. To this day, Judaism considers theologicalideas about God to be a private matter for the individual, for any official doctrine would limit theessential mystery of God. The rabbis also began the important tradition of interpretation andcommentaries on religious texts. Thus there is a fair amount of room in Judaism for individualopinions on such important matters as the nature of God.CHRISTIANITY.Out of Judaism came the new religion of Christianity. Jews at the time ofJesus, under Roman rule, were expecting a Messiah. However, as now passionate monotheists,they expected this Messiah to be human, a descendant of King David, not divine. The term son ofGodhad been used previously in Jewish stories and expressed intimacy with God; it was not tobe taken literally. Although few Jews of the time accepted Jesus as the Messiah, many otherpeople ultimately would.The story of Christianity is essentially the story of Jesus. The Gospel of John describesJesus as the eternal Son of God and the word of God made flesh. Jesus himself never claimed tobe divine, and it was only after his death that his followers seem to have come to this conclusion.This did not happen immediately. It was not until the fourth century C.E. that the doctrine thatJesus had been God in human form (the Incarnation) was established.For Christians Jesus became the mediator between humans and God. They believed thatthe reason God had become human, in the form of Jesus, was to lead people back to God.Salvation had been won for humans by the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. Therefore, salvationwas to be found through faith in Jesus. Through this faith, Christians believed that they would becleansed of their sins, made righteous, and that they would be sanctified and glorified by God inthe life to come.Ultimately, an understanding of the Christian conception of God requires an understandingof the Trinity. The Trinity begins with God, the Father, who is the creator of heaven and earth.God became immanent in Jesus, who is God, the Son, the divine in human form. The Son is anincarnation of the Father, who returned after his physical death on earth to live with the Father,"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"208Chapter 9 • Gods and Spiritsalthough he remains fully present in and to his believers. Jesus promised to send the Holy Spiritto his followers after his death. The Holy Spirit, or Holy Ghost, is the spirit of God, guiding andsustaining the faithful.The concept of the Trinity caused many problems for the ostensibly monotheistic Christians.Under pressure from a hostile Roman world to explain how Christians could worship three divinebeings but still consider themselves monotheistic, Christian apologists put forward several interpre-tations. In general, Christians settled on an interpretation of a single divine substance manifested inthree personas. This view is expressed in the Athanasian Creed: “The Father is God, the Son is God,and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods, but one God.” In Western Christianity,however, the three distinct personas have generally been stressed over the unifying substance.ISLAM.The story of Islam begins with the story of Mohammad, a member of the Qurayshtribe, which in the seventh century C.E. had recently settled in Mecca after having previouslylived as nomadic herdsmen on the Arabian steppes. This act of settling in one place drasticallyaltered their lifestyle, and new values started replacing the old. Mecca was also the location ofthe Kaaba, an ancient and massive cube-shaped shrine. Most Arabs believed that the Kaaba wasoriginally dedicated to al-Lah (Allah), the High God of the ancient Arabian pantheon.Allah was believed to be identical to the God of the Jews and Christians. Although Judaismand Christianity are also monotheistic, both were seen as having strayed from the authenticmonotheism of Abraham, which Islam would seek to restore. Abraham lived before God hadsent either the Torah or the Gospel and was therefore seen as neither a Jew nor a Christian. In thestory of Abraham he has a son, Ishmael, by his concubine Hagar. When Abraham’s wife, Sarah,becomes pregnant with Isaac, she demands that Hagar and Ishmael leave. God consolesAbraham by telling him that both of his sons will be the fathers of great nations. Abraham andIshmael are said to have together built the Kabah for God in Mecca.Muslims believe that the original religion was monotheism but that it has occasionallydecayed into polytheism. At these times God would send prophets, including Moses and Jesus,to renew the message of monotheism. Each prophet brought the message in a way that wasappropriate to his particular time and place. The last prophet was Mohammad, and he receivedmessages meant for all people and all times.Mohammad was visited by an angel, who gave him the command to recite. The Word of Godwas revealed to Mohammad little by little over a period of twenty-three years and would be com-piled into what is called the Qur’an. The power of the Qur’an is based partly on the extraordinarybeauty of the language. Muslims believe that to hear the Qur’an recited is to experience the divine.The early verses of the Qur’an encourage people to look for signs of God’s goodness andpower in the world and to realize how much they owe to God. Muslims believe that God isomniscient and has created everything for a divine purpose. The world is governed by fixed lawsthat ensure the harmonious working of all things. Humans can find peace by knowing and livingby these laws. People must reproduce God’s benevolence in their own society in order to be intouch with the true nature of things. To believe in this is to surrender totally to God. An essentialact in Islam is bowing down in prayer (salat), a gesture of this surrender. In practice, these ideasmean that Muslims have a duty to create a society that is just and equitable, in which the poorand vulnerable are treated well.The God of Islam is more impersonal than the God of Judaism. Muslims believe that God canonly be glimpsed in the signs of nature and is so transcendent that He can be talked about only inparables. In contrast to Christianity there are no obligatory doctrines about God. Theological specu-lation is dismissed as self-indulgent guesses. No one could possibly know or prove the nature of God."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits209AtheismJust as the statement “I believe in God” has meaning only in context, so does the concept ofatheism.For example, early Christians and Muslims were considered atheists by the largersociety in which they lived for refusing to recognize the existing pantheon of gods. In theQur’an an unbeliever is somebody who is ungrateful to God and refuses to honor Him.Atheism has historically meant not accepting the current conception of God.In Europe it was only at the end of the sixteenth century that the term atheistbegan to bewidely used. It was the time of great conflicts between Protestants and Catholics and the prolifera-tion of many Christian sects. Rumors abounded of people—atheists—who denied the existence ofGod. These were much like the rumors of witchcraft, which we will discuss in Chapter 10.In reality atheism, as we conceive of it today, was highly unlikely—perhaps even impossi-ble—for people of the time. In sixteenth-century life, religion and the Church were ubiquitous.They dominated life and were part of nearly every activity. In these conditions it is hard to imaginesomeone gaining enough of an outsider perspective to question God and religion. Even if someonehad managed to do so, this person would have found no support for this perspective in the scienceor philosophy of the time. The term atheistwas used as an insult, to describe someone who did notagree with you about the nature of God. No one would actually use the term to describe himself orherself. It would not be until the end of the eighteenth century that a few Europeans would find itpossible to deny the existence of God.The scientific developments of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were important tothe development of atheism. By the start of the seventeenth century, leading theologians arguedthe existence of God on entirely rational grounds. When these arguments did not hold up wellunder the new science, the existence of God began to be questioned. In large part it was the way inwhich people conceived of the nature of God that made Him vulnerable to this attack. God wasseen as a fact of life that could be examined in much the same way that the natural world was.Another issue was a new emphasis on a literal understanding of the Bible in both Catholicand Protestant traditions. Again, these literal interpretations made the texts vulnerable toquestioning from the new scientific perspective. The heliocentric theory of Copernicus andGalileo was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church not because the theory endangeredbelief in God, but because it contradicted the scriptures. Many years later, the discoveries ofLyell and Darwin would call into question the biblical account of creation.With the eighteenth century and the Enlightenment came new ideas of science and progress.Enlightenment was seen as achievable by people on their own, without relying on the traditions ofthe Church or revelation from God. However, most of the philosophers of the Enlightenment did notreject the idea of God outright, just the conceptions of a cruel God who threatens people with eternaldamnation. They believed in a god, but not the God of the Bible. However, a few people truly werebeginning the trend away from God, and by the end of the century there were philosophers who wereproud to call themselves atheists. There was also an idea that science, which was the foundation forquestioning God, would ultimately replace religion.Science has not been the only factor in the growth of atheism. The challenge of horrifichistorical events such as the Holocaust has also played a role. Some people believe that growingatheism is just the natural result of living in a more secular society.Just as there are different kinds of beliefs in god, there are different kinds of atheists.Some distinguish between weak atheism (disbelief in any god) and strong atheism (denial of theexistence of any god). Another approach is agnosticism, which is the idea that the question ofthe existence of a god is unsolvable, unprovable."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"210Chapter 9 • Gods and SpiritsWhile the numbers of people with no belief in a god have grown dramatically in Europeover the years, it is interesting to note that the same phenomenon has not occurred in the UnitedStates. Although church attendance and membership in traditional religious denominations havefallen, the vast majority of people in the United States still say that they believe in God, whateverthey mean by that.CONCLUSIONThe functioning of the human mind leads us into seeing the world as being the result of the actionsof various types of beings. Our world is populated with actors who we see as responsible for theevents in our lives, especially those that cause us pain and misery. Some of these actors arehumans with supernatural powers—magicians and witches, for example. Others are not human,but are anthropomorphic supernatural beings—spirits and gods. The actions of these supernaturalbeings explain the operation of our world. They provide us with an explanation for what befalls usand provide the basis of action to counter such negative events through ritual activity.The similarity between gods and people is striking. Gods resemble us in appearance, thoughts,and actions. They have human emotions and display the best and worst of human behavior. Thestructure of human society is a model for that of the gods in ways that are both simple and complex.Of course, the powers possessed by supernatural beings go far beyond those of humans. Gods arecreators and destroyers. As such, gods are part of the explanatory system for how the world works.The existence of gods answers many of the big questions in life: How did the world begin? Why arewe here? The existence of spirit beings answers many of the smaller ones: Why do we get sick?What goes bump in the night?SummaryGods and spirits are supernatural beings thatgenerally do not have human origins. The dis-tinction between gods and spirits is to somedegree arbitrary. Spirits are less powerful thangods, are more localized, and are frequentlycollections of nonindividualized supernaturalbeings that are not given specific names andidentities. Examples include the leprechauns ofIreland, the jinn of the Middle East, and theangels and demons of the monotheistic reli-gions. Spirits include guardian spirits, ancestralspirits, and shamans’ spirit helpers. Spirits livein the human world, interacting with humans.They may provide protection, success, and luckbut also are blamed for minor mishaps. Spiritsoften reside in natural and human-made objects.Places of special beauty or unusual charactermay be inhabited by spirits.Gods are more powerful than spirits. Theycontrol major forces of nature, such as the wind,rain, and fertility. Gods are anthropomorphic,with names, origins, and specific attributes.They are born, marry, and sometimes die; theylove and lust; they are wise and dull, loving andhateful, generous and miserly; some are sympa-thetic to human beings, others are hostile. Ahierarchy of gods makes up a pantheon, usuallywith a supreme god at the top. Many types ofgods can be recognized, including creator gods,otiose gods, trickster gods, and attribute gods.Theorists have proposed that the nature ofthe gods in a society mirrors important culturalelements, such as that group’s social structure.Horton proposed that the importance of a highgod in African religions was related to increasedcontact with the outside world and the impor-tance of achieved status over ascribed status.Swanson tested the functionalist ideas ofDurkheim and found that religious hierarchywas more likely to be found in a society that also"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 • Gods and Spirits211had a decision-making hierarchy that containedat least three different levels. He also found thatthe number of attribute gods related to amountof specialization. Psychosocial anthropologistsbelieve that humans project qualities of impor-tant figures such as parents onto the gods.Some scholars believe that the earliesthuman religions centered on fertility, a lunarcycle as opposed to a solar one, and the worshipof a goddess. Examples of goddesses are Ishtarof the ancient Near East, Isis of ancient Egypt,and Kali from Hinduism. From an etic view-point, the role of the Virgin Mary in Catholicismhas some characteristics of a goddess. With thedevelopment of the monotheistic religions thegoddess was suppressed, as these religions con-ceived of god in largely male terms.Polytheistic religions recognize many deities.The more familiar monotheistic religions believe ina single omnipotent and omniscient God. Judaismbelieves that the Jews have been chosen to enterinto a special relationship with God. Out of Judaismcame Christianity. The story of Christianity isessentially the story of Jesus—God who becamehuman to lead people back to God. In Islam, Allahwas believed to be identical to the God of the Jewsand Christians, religions that were seen as havingstrayed from the authentic monotheism ofAbraham, which Islam would seek to restore.Atheism has historically meant not acceptingthe conception of the divine that is found in a partic-ular society at a particular time. It was not until theend of the eighteenth century that atheism took onits present meaning of denying the existence of God.Suggested ReadingsMichael Cuneo, American Exorcism: ExpellingDemons in the Land of Plenty(New York:Doubleday, 2001).[A look at exorcism, largely Christian evangeli-cal, in the United States.]Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion(Boston:Houghton Mifflin, 2006).[Dawkins presents his arguments for atheism.]Felicitas D.

However,witchcraft is not a single, unified concept. When anthropologists speak of witchcraft,they generally refer to individuals who have an innate ability to do evil. A witch does notdepend on ritual to achieve his or her evil ends but simply wills misfortune to occur. In this sensewitchcraft is clearly different from sorcery. (Of course, there is nothing to prevent a witch fromusing magic, but this would lie outside the definition of witchcraft.) In some cultures witchcraftcan be unconscious and unintentional; one can be a witch and not even know it.Although in our culture we tend to think of witches as females, traditionally both sexeshave been accused of witchcraft. Witchcraft accusations reflect underlying social tensions in asociety. Individuals who exhibit antisocial behavior and people in relationships characterized byconflict are likely targets. Along these lines, cultures in which witches are considered primarilyto be women will tend to exhibit tension between the sexes.The concept of individuals with such propensities for evil is found in a wide variety of areas,including New Guinea, Southeast Asia, the Americas, and Europe. However, the best-developeddiscussions of witchcraft in the anthropological literature describing witchcraft in small-scalesocieties are those of witchcraft in African societies. In these societies witchcraft is a verycommon belief and refers to the ability of a person to cause harm by means of a personal powerthat resides within the body of the witch.The term witchcraft,however, is also used to refer to other religious phenomena.Witchcraft, encompassing many of the features found in African witchcraft, was found in peasantcommunities in Europe from medieval to early modern times. Because the people in thesecommunities believed that only God could heal, individuals who practiced healing arts andmidwifery were often stigmatized and thought of as being witches. When witchcraft became ofinterest to various Christian churches, the idea of witchcraft changed to reflect an association withSatan. This led to the famous witchcraft executions in Europe and colonial America. We shouldalso mention that Wicca uses the term witchin a vastly different way. The Wiccan religion will bediscussed in the next chapter.10"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"214Chapter 10 • WitchcraftTHE CONCEPT OF WITCHCRAFT IN SMALL-SCALE SOCIETIESThe idea of witchcraft as an evil force bringing misfortune to members of a community is foundin a great number of societies throughout the world. In these societies witchcraft is evil; there areno good witches. Unlike sorcerers, who perform magic rituals to achieve their evil ends, witchessimply will death and destruction.The power of a witch is clearly a supernatural power. Some witches fly through the air.Others can change their outward physical appearance to that of an animal. Witches havepersonal characteristics that are the antithesis of those that characterize a good, moral person.Witches might practice cannibalism and incest; they show hatred, jealousy, and greed. Thusthey become personifications of all that is evil in a society. Witchcraft beliefs become a way ofobjectifying antisocial behavioral traits.Witchcraft among the AzandeThe Azande are a large cultural group living in southern Sudan and northeastern DemocraticRepublic of Congo (formerly Zaire). The Azande of the southern Sudan were residing within theBritish colony of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in the early part of the twentieth century. Between 1926and 1930 the British anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard made three expeditions to Zandeland.These experiences led to the publication in 1937 of Evans-Pritchard’s analysis of witchcraft inhis important ethnography Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande.1One of the factors that makes the study of Zande witchcraft so important is that among theAzande, witchcraft is an everyday topic of conversation, and people will discuss witchcraft in greatdetail with an outside observer. Therefore Evans-Pritchard had access to a great deal of information.THE ZANDE BELIEF IN WITCHCRAFT.As with many African peoples, the Azande believe thatwitchcraft, or mangu,is something that exists within the body of a witch. The Azande actuallydescribe this something as a physical substance. It is described in many ways. For example, itmight be “an oval blackish swelling . . . in which various small objects are sometimes found.”2It appears to be associated with the intestines or perhaps the liver. And how are the Azande ableto describe witchcraft substances? It is because in the days before the British established controlover the area, an autopsy was performed on people who had been accused of witchcraft whenalive, to determine whether they were truly witches or not.However, because witchcraft is inherited, an autopsy of an accused witch would alsoprove that a particular living person, related to the deceased, was or was not a witch. Manguisthought to be passed down from parent to child of the same sex—from father to son and frommother to daughter. Therefore if a man were proven to possess witchcraft substance, thisconclusion would extend to that man’s father, sons, brothers, and so on. However, the Azanderarely have a theoretical interest in witchcraft. What is important is whether a person at aparticular point in time is acting as a witch toward a specific person. A person can possessmanguand yet not act as a witch. (As we shall see shortly, the identification of witches is morecommonly done through divination, which was discussed in Chapter 7.)Although witchcraft is contained within the physical body, its action is psychic. The psychicaspect of manguis the soul of witchcraft. It usually, but not always, leaves the physical body of thewitch at night, when the victim is asleep, and is directed by the witch into the body of the victim.As it moves, it shines with a bright light that can be seen by anyone during the nighttime.However, during the day it can be seen only by religious specialists."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 • Witchcraft215All types of misfortune that are not clearly caused by some other factor are attributed towitchcraft. This includes accident, illness, and death but also economic misfortunes such as theloss of a crop or the failure of some technological operation. Although there are methods fordealing with witchcraft, it is only in the case of death that there is a demand for compensationfrom the witch, the killing of the witch, often through sorcery, or the execution of the witch bythe legal authority. These latter consequences occurred only for witches who had been heldresponsible for many deaths.A CASE OF WITCHCRAFT.What is important to an Azande is not the philosophy of witchcraft,but its operation in a specific individual. The following is a description of the behavior of theAzande when faced with a case of witchcraft.3Witchcraft accusations are based on real social tensions that exist in Zande society.Witches are never strangers. Accusations grow out of negative emotions and behavior, such asgreed, envy, and hatred. Certain social relationships within Zande society are common breedinggrounds for such emotions, and this is reflected in the pattern of witchcraft accusations.Let us take as our example, a case in which a woman is accused of causing the illness ofher co-wife. The Azande practice plural marriage, and the relationship between co-wives is oftencordial. Yet tension may develop between them, especially if the husband favors one wife overanother or one wife is jealous of the other for other reasons.In a family consisting of a man and his two wives, the senior wife is ill, and this illnesshas lasted a considerable amount of time. The husband must first determine the cause of herillness, and to sort things out, he needs to consult an oracle. Zande oracles were described inChapter 7. The best known are dakpa,the termite oracle; iwa,the rubbing-board oracle; andbenge,the poison oracle.The husband might begin by consulting dakpabecause it is a relatively simple andinexpensive form of divination that can be performed by the man himself. If dakpasuggeststhat witchcraft lies at the root of his wife’s illness, he needs to go to a specialist and consultiwa,the rubbing-board oracle. Not only do these oracles provide the husband with informationand suggest courses of action (including herbal remedies and the performance of therapyrituals), but it is thought that if the witch learns that someone is trying to determine the causeof the illness, the witch might stop so as not to risk being accused.If all of the steps fail to stem the tide of the illness, however, the husband will consultbenge. After confirmation that witchcraft is indeed the cause of the elder wife’s illness, the oper-ator of the oracle must identify the witch. The problem is that bengecan give only a yes or noanswer because the chicken that has been fed the poison can only live or die. However, let uslook at this from an etic viewpoint. A witch is always someone known to the victim, and thecause of a witchcraft attack is usually associated with greed, envy, hatred, or some other antiso-cial behavior. In placing names before the oracle, one would select those people in the communitywho exhibit antisocial behavior, because there is a probability that one of them is the witch.(A person who does not exhibit antisocial behavior would certainly not be a witch.) Becauseantisocial behavior tends to occur frequently in stressful social relationships, among people oneknows, accusations tend to be associated with particular relationships, such as co-wives. Let ussay for the sake of argument that the probability of an individual whose name is placed before theoracle being identified as a witch is one-half, since one-half of the chickens will live and one-halfwill die. Then it follows that a person who shows antisocial behavior and whose name is put tothe oracle has a fifty-fifty chance of being accused of witchcraft."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"216Chapter 10 • WitchcraftOnce the witch has been identified through the poison oracle, the husband can elicit theassistance of the chief, who will send a deputy to handle the affair. This neutral intermediaryconfronts the witch, who invariably claims innocence. However, according to Zande witchcraftbelief, it is possible to possess mangu(witchcraft substance), which might be acting up withoutthe accused person’s conscious knowledge. This gives the accused person a way out. She canperform a simple ritual in which she takes water into her mouth and spits it out, thereby “cool-ing” her witchcraft. If the elder wife gets better, then bengeis praised for identifying the witch.The witch does not suffer any stigma. If the woman continues to be ill, then either the accusedperson was not sincere in cooling down her witchcraft or she did indeed stop but some otherwitch started. This cycle continues until the woman recovers or dies.One can imagine that being accused of witchcraft might cause the accused person toconsider what behaviors led to this turn of events. Perhaps she will now go out of her way to besolicitous about the health of her co-wife and may assist her in her work. The result is amore harmonious household. Of course, the elder wife can become ill again, but the youngerwife might not necessarily be the witch who caused the new illness.AN ANALYSIS OF ZANDE WITCHCRAFT BELIEFS.Evans-Pritchard wrote that “the conceptof witchcraft...provides [the Azande] with a natural philosophy by which the relationsbetween men and unfortunate events are explained and a ready and stereotyped means ofreacting to such events. Witchcraft beliefs also embrace a system of values, which regulatehuman conduct.”4All peoples seek explanations for things that happen in the world, especially misfor-tune. It is in this arena that people frequently turn to supernatural causes, such as spirits,sorcery, or witchcraft. The Azande think of all misfortune as being due to some supernaturalagency.Evans-Pritchard describes the case of a fallen granary. These structures are built on stilts tokeep wild animals from getting in and eating the grain. The shade of the granary is an importantmeeting place where people congregate during the heat of midday. After the harvest, the weightof the grain stored in the granaries is great, and Zandeland is home to a great many termites.Although the men carefully examine the pillars and replace damaged ones before each harvest, itis still possible that termites will weaken the stilts and the granary will fall. If people are sittingunder the structure when it falls, they may be seriously injured.The immediate explanation for the accident is quite simple: Termite-weakened woodstilts could not bear the weight of the grain, and the granary collapsed. Yet the Azande explainthis course of events as an example of witchcraft. The key question here is not, “Why did thegranary collapse?” but “Why were these particular individuals sitting under this particulargranary when it collapsed?” The answer is witchcraft. To most Westerners the fact that thesetwo events occurred at the same time—certain people sitting under the granary and thecollapse of the granary—is simply coincidence or bad luck. However, the Azande do notaccept the concept of coincidence. The fact that these specific individuals were injured wasdue to witchcraft.Because of this way of thinking about cause and effect, witchcraft becomes a good explana-tion for misfortune. Antiwitchcraft rituals and the identification of the witch provide a plan ofaction, or what Evans-Pritchard called “a ready and stereotyped means of reacting to such events.”However, witchcraft cannot be used as an excuse for incompetence or simply bad behavior. If aparticular activity fails because the person is not skilled, then it is not witchcraft. Witchcraft alsocannot be used as an excuse for adultery if the adulterers are caught."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 • Witchcraft217Witchcraft among the NavahoWhereas Zande witches are born with mangu,in other cultures the power of witchcraft is onethat is sought. Again, immoral and antisocial behavioral traits are associated with witchcraft.They drive the individual to do whatever he or she must do to gain power that eventually willsatisfy this emotional need. As our example we will examine witchcraft beliefs among theNavaho of the American Southwest. (It should be noted that although we are using the ethno-graphic present, it has been many decades since the last documented case of witch killingamong the Navaho.)In contrast with the Azande, the Navaho are very reluctant to discuss witchcraft. Manydeny its existence, although this might be because admitting to knowledge of witchcraft is seenas suspicious. Yet witchcraft beliefs are found throughout Navaho society. In contrast with theAzande, Navaho witches are individuals who seek to be initiated into the Witchery Way.Witchcraft is generally associated with immoral and antisocial behavior such as greed,vengeance, and envy. Greedy witches obtain wealth by robbing graves. Another method is to pairup with another witch. One witch causes the illness, and the other witch attempts to “cure” thevictim; the fee is then split between the two witches. Witches are thought to meet in caves atnight, where they practice incest and cannibalism, have intercourse with the dead, and performrituals to kill victims. Witchcraft beliefs act in many ways to enforce social norms. For example,if you do not care for your parents properly, they can become witches.Witchcraft Reflects Human CultureThe study of Zande witchcraft demonstrated that witchcraft beliefs and accusation reflectinterpersonal behavior between people in stressful situations and that stressful behavior isfrequently a recurring situation in particular social relationships. Thus, as we saw in ourexample, the interpersonal relationship between co-wives is potentially a difficult relationship,and this stress is manifested in the form of witchcraft accusations. This point is clearlyillustrated when we compare the systems of witchcraft belief in two different but relatedsocieties: the Nupe and Gwari of West Africa.The Nupe and the Gwari are neighboring societies in the Guinea Coast culture area. Theylive in similar habitats and interact socially and economically with one another. Their socialorganizations are very similar; they even speak closely related languages. And many aspects oftheir religious practices are similar or identical.These two societies accept the existence of witchcraft, and the details of this belief are sim-ilar except for the sex of the witch. Among the Gwari, witches are both men and women; amongthe Nupe they are always women, although the operation of a woman’s witchcraft activities mustbe aided by a man. There are ways of countering and preventing the operation of witchcraft.Among the Gwari, it is through rituals that rid the entire community of witchcraft. Witches areidentified through divination, and the victims are both men and women. The pattern among theNupe is different. Here the witchcraft of women is controlled through secret activities of the men.According to our hypothesis that witchcraft accusations are signs of difficult socialrelationships, we might want to examine differences in interpersonal relationships in the twogroups. Among the Nupe, the general picture is one of antagonism between men and women,reflected in the fact that witches are always women and men have the ability to control the activityof female witches. Further study reveals a major difference in marriage relationships in the twogroups. Among the Gwari, marriage is generally free of tension, but this is not the case with the Nupe.This is likely due to differences in the economic systems. Among the Nupe, married women can"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"218Chapter 10 • Witchcraftbecome itinerant traders and have the potential of economic success. Their husbands are oftenin debt to their wives, and wives take over certain economic tasks that usually fall within thesphere of activity of men. These include paying for feasts and gathering together thebridewealth for sons. Men are angry and resentful over the situation but really cannot doanything about it. In addition, among the Nupe, itinerant traders can be married women wholeave young children in the care of extended family, and even refuse to have children, to be freeto ply their trade. Although men condemn this activity as immoral, once again they are helplessto do anything about it. It is this anger and hostility that are projected into the world of witch-craft, in which witches—interestingly, visualized as itinerant traders—are women who can becontrolled by the men. Thus men have power over women in the realm of witchcraft but not inthe real world.Sorcery, Witchcraft, and AIDSIn the previous section we saw how witchcraft beliefs functioned to provide explanations formisfortune and a means of actively dealing with the perceived cause. In the case of illness,the emphasis in modern medical theory is on discovering the cause of the illness—perhaps amalfunction of the body organs or the invasion of an infectious agent. Once the cause isdetermined, an appropriate response is made to cure the illness through surgery, medication,and other therapies. In societies that lack an extensive knowledge of modern medical theory,the cause of illness and other misfortunes is usually attributed to some causal agent.This agent may be a supernatural being, such as a ghost or a spirit, or it may be a humanagent engaged in sorcery or witchcraft. In the latter case the emphasis is on the identificationof the person responsible through divination and other means followed by appropriate action,including the identification and possible execution of the individual responsible.When a small-scale society comes into contact with a larger, more powerful society, cul-ture change can be rapid, extensive, and often catastrophic. A major consequence of contact isthe introduction of outside diseases to which the indigenous population lacks immunity. As aresult the death rate from introduced diseases soars and cultures collapse. While the outsidesociety will often introduce modern medical practices, usually on a limited scale, there is littlebasis in the traditional culture upon which to build an understanding of a medical theory,especially when outside medical procedures are not always successful. It is not at all surprising,then, that people use their traditional interpretations of illness and practices of healing.One of the most devastating diseases to be introduced into traditional communities hasbeen AIDS. In the 1980s, anthropologist Paul Farmer observed the first case of AIDS in a ruralvillage in Haiti.5The villagers had some limited knowledge of a disease called sida. Sida,orAIDS, was seen as a city sickness, since it was only reported from urban areas by villagers whohad visited the cities or had relatives living there. As the incidence rate in urban areas climbed,the government began a public health campaign that reached the rural villages. Interest in AIDSwas limited until 1987 when the first villager contracted AIDS. This was followed by otherdeaths from AIDS in the years that followed.Medical information spread through public health campaigns mixed with traditionalbeliefs led to varying interpretation of AIDS. Some cases were seen as being contracted bysleeping with an infected person and condoms were effective against this form of AIDS. Butother cases had more sinister roots.The first victim of AIDS in the village was a teacher who also held down other jobs andtherefore had a better source of income than most of the villagers. It was widely believed that"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 • Witchcraft219jealousy drove a rival to pay a Vodou priest to send a “dead person” against the victim. Anothercase involved a jealous rival who placed a poison in the form of an invisible powder in thevictim’s path. These cases involve sorcery, but other cases involve witchcraft.In our study of Zande witchcraft we learned that misfortune, including illness and death,are seen as deliberate attacks by a witch. Things occur because of a reason, and attacks by witchesare motivated by great emotions, most frequently envy and jealously, on the part of the people inthe victims’ community and even family. In Western medicine the crucial questions revolvearound the mechanism of the illness, and bodily malfunction or infectious agent. In more tradi-tional societies the critical issues are: Why am I being attacked, by whom, and why? Answers tothese questions might lead to resolution and cure.The nature of AIDS lends itself to interpretations of witchcraft and sorcery. It is a complexdisease that is not very well understood. The victim suffers over a long period of time, appearingto get better and then decline again. Outwardly it often parallels traditional beliefs in illnessescaused by witchcraft. The available medical technology is essentially ineffective. It appears tostrike randomly and is especially seen among the poor. In several studies of AIDS in Africa, thepresence of AIDS quite often leads to accusations of witchcraft, often within the family, with thesubsequent tragedy of homicide of the alleged witch.EURO-AMERICAN WITCHCRAFT BELIEFSAlthough Euro-American ideas about witchcraft show some similarities to those of small-scalesocieties, there are many important differences. Both cultures see witches as evildoers, but ideasof witchcraft in Europe were influenced by Christian ideas about the nature of evil. As wasdiscussed in Chapter 9, one of the challenges facing Christianity (as well as Judaism and Islam)is how to explain the existence of evil when God has been described as unique, all-powerful, andall-good. One answer to this problem posits the existence of an evil spirit of great power. InHebrew this spirit was called Satan, the adversary. This was translated in Greek as diabolosandin English as the devil. Satan is not a major figure in the Hebrew Bible; however, he did receivea great deal of attention in Judaism during the Apocalyptic period (200 B.C.E. to 150 C.E.), a timeduring which Jews were focused on the idea of an imminent apocalypse and the coming of themessiah. However, from that time on, the rabbis came to dominate Judaism, and Satan receivedvery little attention.One important event during the apocalyptic period was the origin of Christianity; the NewTestament prominently features Satan. The message of the New Testament is that Jesus Christsaves us from the power of the Devil. Part of the new definition of the evil of witchcraft is thatwitches are individuals who have made a pact with the Devil.The Connection with Pagan ReligionsWe said earlier that in small-scale societies the concepts of witchcraft and sorcery are quite distinct.This changes with European witchcraft beliefs, in which sorcery gets bound up with witchcraft—thus our common perception of witches doing spells. There were also important changes in the con-ception of sorcery. Previously, sorcery had been seen as largely mechanical, a manipulation of thesupernatural. Now sorcery became associated with the invocation of spirits. Although sorcery hadalways been an antisocial behavior and seen as a hostile act, sorcery was now defined as also beinghostile to God. The spirits of sorcery were defined as demons. Therefore, anyone doing sorcery, orfor the most part any magic, was seen as calling upon the servants of Satan."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"220Chapter 10 • WitchcraftSome have argued that this was part of the larger persecution of pagan religious practices.Christians were arguing that Jesus was the Son of God, and a large part of their argument was basedon the miracles that he performed. Skeptics of the day were likely to counter with the argument thatJesus was merely another sorcerer, performing magic. So for Christians the only legitimate magicbecame the magic performed by Jesus; all other magic was the work of the Devil. Magic andwitchcraft became not just crimes against society, but heresy—crimes against God.The Christian theology of the time argued that pagan magic and religion were all the workof the Devil, part of his plan to lure people away from the truth of Christianity. The pagan godsand goddesses were thus redefined by Christians as servants of Satan. However, at the level ofpopular religion many of the pagan beliefs and gods were absorbed into the Christian religion.The nature of the Catholic Church’s response to heresy underwent dramatic changesduring this time. Beginning in the twelfth century, laws dealing with heresy became more severe.A factor in this state of affairs was the revival of Roman law. Under Roman law, people are seenas part of the corporation that is the state and therefore must follow its principles. In the lateRoman Empire several codes had declared that crimes against God were worthy of punishmentby death. The revival of Roman law encouraged the imposition of harsher penalties for heresy.For example, burning became the punishment of choice for relapsed heretics and was increasingin frequency. Witches, as heretics, were burned as well. However, from the fifteenth centuryonward, witches were treated even more harshly than other heretics. Most heretics were burnedonly in the case of relapse; witches were burned on a first conviction.Before the thirteenth century, the only way for a heretic to be brought to trial was if anindividual made an accusation against that person. It was not long, though, before bishops beganholding Inquisitions, or formal investigations. Instead of waiting for an accusation, the authori-ties began to actively go looking for heretics, particularly witches. By the end of the thirteenthcentury, inquisitors were assigned to most areas of continental Europe. Most of the inquisitorscame from the Franciscan or Dominican religious order.At the beginning, most sentences appear to have been penances such as wearing a crosssewn to one’s clothes or going on a pilgrimage. The goal of the inquisitor was primarily to iden-tify the guilty and get them to confess and repent in order to restore them to the fold. Only asmall number of the cases resulted in execution. These were generally reserved for relapsedheretics or for obstinate heretics (those who refused to repent). In time, though, the punishments,especially for witches, became more severe.Inquisitions were a powerful means of enforcing sanctions against heretics and witches. Atfirst the bishops were encouraged in their efforts, but between 1227 and 1235 the papal Inquisitionwas established. The power of the Inquisition was constantly being corroborated and expanded.For example, in 1252, Innocent IV issued the papal bull Ad Extirpanda.This bull authorized theimprisonment of heretics, the seizure of their possessions, and their imprisonment, torture, andexecution. All of this was done on what was usually minimal evidence. The procedures of theInquisition were such that guilt was easy to establish and innocence was difficult to defend. Itshould be noted that although the Inquisition was a Catholic institution, Protestants were alsoinvolved in the conviction and execution of witches during this time.The Witchcraze in EuropeAt the end of the Middle Ages, witches were believed to be individuals, both male and female,who had formally repudiated Christianity and made a pact with the Devil. Witches were believedto ride by night and to have secret nocturnal meetings. As we saw with witchcraft in small-scale"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 • Witchcraft221societies, witches generally represent all that is evil and antisocial. In this case, witches werebelieved to have orgies, to engage in sacrificial infanticide and cannibalism, and to desecrateChristian holy objects such as the crucifix and the Eucharist.The period known as the Witchcraze began at the end of the Middle Ages (around 1450)and lasted for about 200 years. Many scholars date the start of the Witchcraze to the time atwhich the Inquisition began actively seeking out witches. Although people associate this withthe “Dark Ages,” it actually was a product of the Renaissance and Reformation. TheWitchcraze was a time in which many people were accused, convicted, and executed aswitches. Exact numbers are hard to come by, but estimates range from a few thousand toseveral million people.One invention in the 1450s in particular helped to spread these ideas: the printing press.One of the most important books published during this time was the Malleus Maleficarum,or the Hammer against Witches,which was published by the Catholic Church in 1486 (Figure 10.1). The Malleusspells out the Church’s beliefs about witches at the time. Witcheswere people who renounced the Catholic faith and devoted themselves, body and soul, to theservice of evil. Witches offered unbaptized children to the Devil and engaged in orgies thatFIGURE 10.1Cover ofMalleusMaleficarum.The title page of aFrench edition of MalleusMaleficarum,published in 1669.MALLEVSMALEFICARVM.MALEFIC AS ET EARVMhserefim framca conterens,EX VARIIS AVCTORIBVS COMPILATVS,& in quatuor Tomos iuftc diftributus,gyORVM DVO FKIOS.ES FANJS D MMONVM•vtrfutias, fnjiigicfas e or urn -itluJioMS, fvftrjlitiofas Strigimagarumctrcmomas, horrendos ilium turn illis imgrejfas ; ixtftim denguetarn fefliftrt fiSx difytiifitwncm , & fumlicnem to,nflc£lmtM.rmi'uspraxim Exorcijlurum ad Ddmmum , & Strigimxgartim malt-ficia de chrifii fdilibm felletida; Suartus veri Arum SeHrhaitm,Btncdiclunalcm, & Exercifmalcm tmt'ment.TOMVS PRIMVS.Indicts AH Utrrum, cepitum, rcrumtptt non dtftm.Editto nouiilima , infinites penc Dlendis expurgate ; cuique acccflic FugaDarmonum & Conplcmcntum aitis exorcifticx.Virfmc mulitr,in tjmbui PjtbomCHS, vtl dmnaiomtfucritfpiriiut, mini muittttrLeaftici cap. 10.M.

Witches were also typically believed toshift shapes, fly through the air, and make magical ointments. The Malleusalso stated thatwitches were more likely to be women than men, something we will return to later. TheMalleusspelled out what to do with a witch: All witches must be arrested, convicted, andexecuted. It is important to note that even people who spoke out against the Witchcraze didnot challenge the actual existence of witches. To do so at this time would have been tanta-mount to declaring oneself an atheist.People who were accused of witchcraft were interrogated to obtain a confession. Thequestions they were asked presumed their guilt. For example, common questions includedwhere and when they met with the Devil. The question of whether or not they had done such athing was never asked. Torture was a common means of gaining a confession. In 1628 a mannamed Johannes Junius was executed as a witch. What is unusual about this case is that he wasable to smuggle a letter out of prison to his daughter before he died. What follows is a portion ofthat letter:6Many hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica. Innocent haveI come into prison, innocent have I been tortured, innocent must I die. For whoevercomes into the witch prison must . . . be tortured until he invents something out of hishead.. . . When I was the first time put to the torture, Dr. Braun, Dr. Kötzendörffer, andtwo strange doctors were there. The Dr. Braun asks me, “Kinsman, how come youhere?” I answer, “Through falsehood, through misfortune.” “Hear you,” he retorts, “youare a witch; will you confess it voluntarily? If not, we’ll bring in witnesses and theexecutioner for you.” I said, “I am no witch, I have a pure conscience in the matter; ifthere are a thousand witnesses, I am not anxious.” [The witnesses were broughtforward.] And then came also—God in the highest heaven have mercy—the executioner,and put the thumb-screws on me, both hands bound together, so that the blood ran out atthe nails and everywhere, so that for four weeks I could not use my hands, as you cansee from the writing. . . . Thereafter, they first stripped me, bound my hands behind me,and drew me up in the [strappado]. Then I thought heaven and earth were at an end;eight times did they draw me up and let me fall again, so that I suffered terribleagony.. . . And so I made my confession...but it was all a lie.As the sixteenth century progressed, the Witchcraze only increased in intensity. Religiousconflict, popular movements, and wars during the Reformation exacerbated social tensions,which were then reflected in witchcraft accusations. The Witchcraze did not decline until the late1600s and early 1700s.The Witchcraze in England and the United StatesThe Witchcraze in England was at first somewhat different from that in continental Europe.England had no Inquisition, no Roman law, and only a weak tradition of heresy—all of whichhad contributed to the Witchcraze elsewhere. There was no English translation of the MalleusMaleficarumuntil modern times. English witchcraft remained closer to the idea of sorcery, withan emphasis on the power of witches to place hexes and curses. In the 1500s, English witcheswere not believed to fly, conduct orgies, or make pacts with the Devil. Instead, they harmedlivestock, caused diseases, and hurt infants and children. The first statutes against witchcraft in"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 • Witchcraft223England were not passed until the mid-1500s. Even then, witches were prosecuted under civil,not religious, law. This is why witches in England, and later the United States, were hanged andnot burned. Burning was the punishment for heretics.Ideas more like those on the European continent eventually made their way into Englandthrough Scotland and King James I, who was a major proponent of the Witchcraze. The height ofthe Witchcraze in England occurred during the 1640s. The English Civil War at the time wasproducing even greater anxieties and insecurities. America lagged even farther behind; the firsthanging of a witch in New England did not occur until 1647.By far the most famous of the witch trials in the Americas occurred in Salem in 1692. Thistrial is well documented and has been extensively studied. The immediate cause of the trials appearsto have been two young girls (ages nine and eleven) who were experimenting with divinationtechniques in an attempt to discover who their future husbands would be. In the process, theymanaged to scare themselves and began exhibiting nervous symptoms. They thrashed around andassumed odd postures. The father of one of the girls was Samuel Parris, the local minister. He calledin a physician to examine the girls, but the doctor was unable to find anything wrong. It was thisphysician who first suggested that the girls might be victims of a witch’s spell.The girls’ behavior became worse, and soon other young girls and young women alsobegan to suffer from fits and convulsions. The girls were questioned and named three women aswitches: Sarah Goode, Sarah Osborne, and a West Indian slave named Tituba. Soon more wereaccused. The fits increased in intensity. The girls screeched, howled, reported visions, andsuffered from mysterious tooth marks. The trials themselves were dramatic affairs at which thegirls exhibited these symptoms. In all, nineteen people were executed, and more than 100 werejailed.Most of the commentaries on the Salem trials focus on what, from an outsider’s perspective,was really going on here. Early suggestions included the girls being delusional and the whole thingbeing a vicious prank. Perhaps they enjoyed the attention, or maybe they were overcome by thepower of suggestion. More recent research has suggested a possible biological component in theform of ergot poisoning. Ergot poisoning comes from eating a particular mold found in the grainrye, and among its symptoms are hallucinations.The events that took place in Salem, like many cases of witchcraft, resulted from the ebband flow of everyday activities of people that characterize living in a community. Witchcraftaccusations were the end result of stressful social relationships as well as situations arising fromthe politics, economics, and religious practices of the community.Salem was not a single community. It was a farming society at the edge of the settledworld at that time. In the not too distant past, before the period of the witchcraft trials,Salem had experienced conflict with the local native population and felt the need to defenditself. By the time of the trials, Salem was a rapidly growing community, one that includedan extensive hinterland, and as the population grew, so did pressures on the land. In fact,many neighborhoods of the town were petitioning the colonial government for status asindependent villages.As is common in many societies throughout the world, those accused of witchcraft wereprimarily people living on the fringes of society. Many were marginalized and powerless womenwithout husbands, brothers, or sons to protect their interests. Others were those who dealt withfolk remedies and midwifery. “When such remedies went bad, and when face-to-face disputeresolution failed, the customers who paid for the cures or the potions might conclude that thepurveyor was at fault. Thus premodern malpractice became witchcraft.”7"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"224Chapter 10 • WitchcraftFUNCTIONS OF EURO-AMERICAN WITCHCRAFT BELIEFS.Many of the functions that wediscussed for small-scale societies are applicable here. Witches define all that is wrong andimmoral. People who exhibit antisocial behavior or who stand out in any way are the most likelytargets of witchcraft accusations. In the European example, witches helped to define the bound-aries of Christianity and the cohesion of the Christian community. Witches were people whoturned their backs on Christianity and made a pact with the Devil. They were heretics—peoplewho sinned against God.Witches also fulfill our unconscious need to blame someone for the misfortunes that weexperience in our daily lives. It is more psychologically satisfying to have an identifiable individ-ual who can be blamed and punished than to shrug our shoulders and attribute misfortune to badluck. In general, patterns of witchcraft accusations also reflect deeply felt conflicts and divisionsin a culture. The studies have shown this to be true for Salem, for example. Deeply felt moraldivisions over the governance of the church, along with neighborhood and family conflicts, wereshowcased in the Salem witch trials.BOX 10.1The Evil EyeAlthough not usually thought of as witchcraft, belief in the evil eye has many of the characteristicsassociated with witchcraft. The power of the evil eye, like that of witchcraft, lies within the body ofthe individual, who might or might not be aware of it. This belief is found primarily in India, theNear East, parts of Europe, and Mexico.A person with the evil eye is able to cause illness or some other type of misfortune simply bylooking at or praising someone or something. This is especially the case with babies, and in manysocieties it is considered bad form to praise or say something complimentary about a child, or thechild could become ill and perhaps die. The concept is associated with envy, and people with theevil eye are jealous over the success or good luck of others.One can avoid the evil eye by wearing charms that ward away the danger and by the recitationof certain formulas. When complimenting a person or praising a person, one makes sure to begin andend the compliment with a special formula. Spitting or particular hand gestures are also used toprotect one against the malignant power of the evil eye. Another strategy is to conceal one’s goodfortune and avoid looking prosperous.The idea of the evil eye varies from society to society. In the Mayan region of Mexico, illnessmay be caused by ojo,or the evil eye, by a man or animal simply looking at a child.aPeople withthe evil eye are dangerous, and one must deal with them with great care. One can recognize theseindividuals by a mole, a prominent vein, or a mark between the eyebrows. Cures may be effectedby some type of contact with the person who has the evil eye. For example, a man who hasbrought about sickness in a child might be asked to place the child’s finger in his mouth or rubsome of his saliva on the child’s mouth.aR. Redfield and A.

There are many reasons forthis. First, the Malleus Maleficarumitself says that women are more likely to be witches. This isbecause, according to the Malleus,women are weaker, stupider, more superstitious, and moresensual than men. The Malleustells us:8All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman....What else is a womanbut a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temp-tation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil ofnature, painted in fair colours....The word woman is used to mean the lust of theflesh, as it is said: I have found a woman more bitter than death, and a good womanmore subject to carnal lust....There are more superstitious women found than men.And the first is, that they are more credulous; and since the chief aim of the devil isto corrupt faith, therefore he rather attacks them [than men]....Women arenaturally more impressionable, and more ready to receive the influence of a disem-bodied spirit....They have slippery tongues, and are unable to conceal from theirfellow-women those things by which evil arts they know....[T]hey are feebler bothin mind and body....Women are intellectually like children....She is more carnalthan a man as is clear from her many carnal abominations....She is an imperfectanimal, she always deceives....And indeed, just as through the first defect in theirintelligence they are more prone to abjure the faith; so through their second defect ofinordinate affections and passions they search for, brood over, and inflict variousvengeances, either by witchcraft, or by some other means. Wherefore it is no wonderthat so great a number of witches exist in this sex.Beliefs about witches included intercourse with the Devil. During a witch’s interrogation,she was asked to name demons that had been her lovers and to describe the Devil’s phallus. Thefact that the Devil is almost universally perceived as male might have been a factor in labelingwomen as witches.Sixteenth-century Europe was unusually misogynistic. Some historians have suggested that thiswas due to demographic changes. More men than women died from the plague and from warfare. Asa result, there was a demographic imbalance, with more women living alone than usual. The socialposition of a woman living alone in a patriarchal society, in which women were defined in relation tomen, would have been difficult. The weaker social position of women made it easier for them to beaccused. Another demographic change that likely had an impact was the increasing movement fromthe countryside to life in the city, with the accompanying increase in insecurities.Among women, midwives appear to have been a particular target. Infant and maternalmortality rates were both high at the time and these deaths, along with any deformity or illness,were likely to be blamed on the midwife. Some researchers have also noted the connectionbetween the persecution of midwives as witches and the rise of the profession of male doctors.Modern-Day Witch HuntsAt the height of the McCarthy era, Arthur Miller wrote the play The Crucible, which used theSalem trials as an allegory for McCarthyism. The term witch huntis often used to describe modernevents, but how similar are these to the historical and cross-cultural events that we have discussedso far in this chapter?"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"226Chapter 10 • WitchcraftBOX 10.2SatanismMost modern Satanists do not conform to the conceptions that many people have about them.We must distinguish between people who have been labeled Satan worshippers by others, whichfor some conservative Christian groups would include any non-Christian religion, and those wholabel themselves as Satanists.Very few people actually worship Satan as the personification of evil, although some doclaim to worship a Lucifer or Satan whom they believe is an ancient deity mistakenly identified asthe Devil by Christians. The view these Satanists have of Satan is a pagan image that focuses onpower, virility, and sexuality. To most Satanists, though, Satan is more like a force of nature than adeity. Their Satan is not the Christian Devil and has nothing to do with the Christian Hell, demons,buying people’s souls, human sacrifice, or truly evil deeds. Satanists do not even believe thatHeaven and Hell exist.Although there is much variety in the beliefs of Satanists, we can describe some of themore common beliefs. Satanists generally believe that each person is fully responsible for his orher own life, and the emphasis is on the individual, not on a god or goddess. Lusts and desiresare seen not as sins to be avoided, but as possibilities to be experienced. Life itself is respectedand valued; despite common misconceptions, Satanists do not advocate or practice animal orhuman sacrifices.The largest of the many religious traditions within Satanism is the Church of Satan, foundedby Anton Szandor La Vey in 1966. In the forward to The Satanic Bible(1969), Burton Wolfe states,“Satanism is a blatantly selfish, brutal philosophy. It is based on the belief that human beings areinherently selfish, violent creatures.”aLa Vey believes that the Judeo-Christian traditions havetaught us to suppress our true feelings, which has resulted in nothing but misery. The Church ofSatan could be described as a form of hedonism. Satanists believe in the gratification of all ofone’s desires. Instead of abstinence, Satanists believe in indulgence. The behaviors that the CatholicChurch labels as sin are seen as virtuous. The Church of Satan does recognize sins, but they areentirely different ones, including stupidity, pretentiousness, self-deceit, and conformity. The Churchof Satan says that although it is important to be kind to those who deserve it, one should not wastelove on those who do not deserve it. Do not turn the other cheek; instead, seek vengeance.Rituals are conducted and generally are one of three types: ones that involve sex magic,ones that are focused on healing or happiness, and destruction rituals focused on a specific victim.(Satanists believe that if a person is targeted by a destruction ritual but does not deserve it, thatperson will not be harmed.) The use of magic in Satanism does resemble somewhat the magicalpractices of Wicca (Chapter 7). However, many Satanists think that the Wiccans are hypocritesbecause they limit their magic to positive uses. In contrast, although Satanists use magic to bene-fit themselves and their friends, they also use the magic and rituals to harm their enemies.The most important symbol of the Church of Satan is the Sigil of Baphomet, which is a goat’shead drawn within an inverted pentagram (Figure 3.2). At the time The Satanic Biblewas written(1969), it was common for Satanists to use a naked woman as an altar, symbolizing that Satanismis a religion of the flesh, not the spirit. This is now rarely used. Although Satanists have often beenblamed for kidnapping and the sacrifice of people and animals, this appears to be urban legend.aBurton H. Wolfe, introduction to A. S. La Vey, The Satanic Bible(New York: Harper Collins, 1969), p. 18."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 • Witchcraft227The McCarthy era took place in the early 1950s. Beginning with “loyalty” programs underPresident Truman and extending to investigations by the House Committee on Un-AmericanActivities that resulted in blacklists and jail terms, the overwhelming concern was that “radicals”and communists were part of a vast conspiracy to destroy American democracy.How similar were the events of the McCarthy era to the European witch hunts? Both beganwith strong emotions fueling a “scare” of a vast secret conspiracy whose purpose was purely subver-sive and potentially apocalyptic. The focus in both cases was identification of the adversaries ofsociety, with investigations spiraling as those identified were pressured to implicate others. Bothfocused on purity and unity and showed an intense preoccupation with loyalty (to Christianity dur-ing the European Witchcraze, to American democracy during the McCarthy era).The most obvious difference is the lack of a supernatural, religious element to McCathryism.However, both certainly showed extraordinary levels of exaggeration and misperception. The ideasabout communists and subversives during the McCarthy era reached beyond reality into outrightfantasy. For a modern witch hunt case that includes more direct religious elements, we can look atthe child sex abuse crisis in the 1980s.During the 1960s and 1970s, much about modern family life had changed, includingshifting gender roles and a rise in divorce rates. The 1960s also saw the “discovery” of childbattering and in 1974 the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act was passed. Adding tothe cultural mix was a growth in religious cults, and growing fears of Satanism and the occult(see Chapter 11). Many in American society believed that Satanic cults were sexually abusingchildren. The general mood was one of fearfulness about the family and children specifically;the family was seen as disintegrating and children were being put in peril. The mix ofemotions (fear, guilt, outrage) set the stage for our next example of a witch hunt.Beginning in California in the early 1980s, authorities thought they had discovered Satanic “sexrings” that were sexually abusing children and engaging in various acts of Devil worship. Perhaps themost famous case is that of the McMartin Preschool, but there were dozens, perhaps hundreds, ofinvestigations. Evidence to support the allegations of Satanic activity was never found and themethods used by investigators have largely been discredited. Although favoring the prosecutionperspective at first, even the media at the time eventually labeled these cases as witch hunts.CONCLUSIONFear of the existence of supernaturally evil individuals appears to be universal. And who should wefear most as potential evildoers? People who stand out, people with whom we have existing conflicts.If my neighbor is jealous of my success, might she not want to bring me down and cause me harm?Of course, she might well think the same of me. The witch is the enemy within—the member of thecommunity who rejects, subverts, and betrays. As with many religious phenomena, witchcraftaccusations are closely tied to other social phenomena—in this case, reflecting existing tensions andfears. In reality the most common way to become a witch is to be accused of being one.Witchcraft is a fascinating subject within the realm of religious beliefs and behaviors. Studyingthis phenomenon is made more complicated by the different ways in which the term has been used insmall-scale, European, and modern neo-pagan communities, discussed in the next chapter. Our contin-uing interest in the subjects of magic and witchcraft can be seen in popular media representations suchas the television shows Bewitched, Charmed, Sabrina the Teenage Witch,and Buffy the Vampire Slayerand of course the extremely popular Harry Potter book series. However, these fantasy representationsdiffer significantly from the real phenomena. First, these sources show magic and witchcraft as verysimilar phenomena, if not one and the same. Second, witches are portrayed in a very positive light,"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"228Chapter 10 • WitchcraftSummaryThe idea of witchcraft as an evil force bringingmisfortune to members of a community is foundin a great number of societies throughout theworld. Unlike sorcerers, who perform magic ritu-als to achieve their evil ends, witches simply willdeath and destruction and it happens, for thesource of this evil is a supernatural power thatlies within the body of the witch. Witches possesspersonal characteristics that are the antithesisof those that characterize a good, moral person.The concept of witchcraft in small-scale societiesis largely based on the work of E. E. Evans-Pritchard among the Azande of the Sudan. Evans-Pritchard concluded that a belief in witchcraftserves three functions: It provides an explanationfor the unexplainable; it provides a set of culturalbehaviors for dealing with misfortune; and itserves to define morality.Ideas of witchcraft in Europe were influ-enced by Christian ideas about the nature of evil.Christianity accepts the existence of an evil spirit,known as Satan or the Devil. In this belief system,witches are individuals whose evil power origi-nates with a pact with the Devil. In Europe,witchcraft beliefs were merged with sorcery.Sorcery became associated with the invocation ofspirits, which was defined as being hostile toGod. Anyone doing any form of magic was seenas calling on the servants of Satan. Magic andwitchcraft became not just crimes against society,but heresy—crimes against God. The periodknown as the Witchcraze began at the end of theMiddle Ages (around 1450) and lasted for about200 years. In Euro-American witchcraft beliefs,witches define all that is wrong and immoral.People who exhibit antisocial behavior are themost likely targets of witchcraft accusations.Witches also fulfill our unconscious need toblame someone for the misfortunes that we expe-rience in our daily lives. In general, patterns ofwitchcraft accusations reflect deeply felt conflictsand divisions in a society.Suggested ReadingsJohn Demos, The Enemy Within: A Short History ofWitch-Hunting(New York: Penguin Books,2008).[A look at witch hunts in Europe, early Americaand modern America]Alan Dundes (Ed.), The Evil Eye: A Casebook(Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992).[Description of the evil eye in different cultures.]Peter Charles Hoffer, The Devil’s Disciples: Makers ofthe Salem Witchcraft Trials(Baltimore, MD:Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996).[A detailed analysis of the Salem witchcrafttrials.]Jeffrey Russell, The History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers,Heretics, and Pagans(London: Thames andHudson, 1980).[A look at witchcraft in tribal societies, histori-cal Europe, and modern times.]FictionRudolfo Anaya, Bless Me Ultima(New York: WarnerBooks, 1999).which fits only the Wiccan definition (Chapter 11).

In doing so, they are exposed to many influences that result in change—both posi-tive and negative. We have much to learn from these societies, including the effects ofculture contact, how cultures change over time, and how new religions come into being. This is astarting point from which to look at cultural and religious change in the larger-scale cultures inwhich we live. Our comparative study of various religious systems and our understanding ofbasic anthropological principles now place us in a position to analyze aspects of our own culturefrom an entirely new perspective. This is what we will attempt to do in this final chapter.This chapter discusses several topics. We will begin with a study of the process of culturechange, especially in the context of outside influence resulting from economic, political, andsocial exploitation. We will see how the processes of change can lead to the demise of a cultureor adjustments for survival. In many contact situations, the dominated culture reacts with theformation of new religious movements that frequently combine cultural elements from both thedominant and dominated societies. Such revitalization movements not only are found amongtribal peoples but also form the basis of today’s Western religions, including many new religiousmovements. Such movements are always affected by existing cultural ideologies and raise manyquestions, including how new religions will be perceived by the society at large.ADAPTATION AND CHANGEThroughout this book we have seen examples of how religion reinforces a society’s culture andworldview. Religious institutions also provide mechanisms for dealing with the inevitable stressesthat are part of living. In general, religious practices tend to be very conservative. This conser-vatism is derived from their sacred nature and the fact that a society’s belief system is usuallyconsidered to be ancient—that is, it was practiced in the old time by the ancestors.However, change does occur. In fact, change must occur if a society is to endure. Theworld does not exist in a steady state. Changes happen in the climate, in the availability of foodand water, in the presence of hostile peoples on one’s borders. If the society is to survive, it mustadapt and change to meet the challenges brought about by this changing world.However, we should not think of a society as a perfectly tuned machine meeting stress andchange in stride. Sometimes changes occur too slowly or too quickly to be effective, or changeCHAPTERThe Search for New Meaning11"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning231does not occur at all. Sometimes changes appear that are maladaptive. Yet in the long run, if asociety is to survive, it must adapt to some degree to the world as it exists.Mechanisms of Culture ChangeGenerally speaking, societies that are technologically simple tend to be relatively isolated fromoutside influences and tend to change slowly over time. Internal change can and does occurthrough the processes of discoveryand invention. A discovery is a new awareness of somethingthat exists in the environment. An invention occurs when a person, using the technology at hand,comes up with a solution to a particular problem.Societies do not exist in isolation; people are aware of the existence of other communitiesbeyond their boundaries. The mere existence of other cultures with different technologies, socialorganizations, and religious practices exposes a society to new ideas and new technologies.When two groups, such as those within a culture area, face similar problems, solutions that aredeveloped in one group through discovery and invention might be adopted by the other. Thisapparent movement of cultural traits from one society to another is called diffusion.Technological traits are more likely to diffuse than are social and religious traits. Sometimes it isonly the idea that moves from one culture to another, and stimulated by that idea, the receivingsociety invents a new trait, a process called stimulus diffusion.When a trait diffuses from one culture to another, it is often altered to a greater or lesserdegree to become consistent with the rest of the receiving culture. Perhaps the use of a halluci-nogenic drug is introduced into a society from a neighboring group. Yet how that drug is used inritual might differ. Differences will occur in which rituals the drug is used, who uses it, and whatit means. An introduced trait has to be altered to fit into the cultural system and to reflect thebasic premises of the culture.ACCULTURATION.Sometimes, however, the influence of one culture on another is moreintense. Rather than sporadic contact through trade and other joint activities, one societymight assume political and/or economic control over another. If both societies are fairly equalpolitically and economically, both societies will borrow traits from one another, and overtime, the societies will become more and more similar. Usually, however, one society is ableto dominate the other, and the dominant culture undergoes far less change than does thesubordinate one. The dominant society is the one that, usually because of a more developedtechnology and wealth, is able to establish control over the subordinate one. In this case thesubordinate culture experiences change as traits are accepted, often at a rate that is too rapidto properly integrate the traits into the culture.This process is referred to as acculturation. A society that has undergone change of thistype is said to be acculturated. Thus an anthropologist who enters a tribal village and sees cans ofsoda, metal knives, pots and pans, and a radio knows that this is an acculturated community.When the dominated society has changed so much that it has ceased to have its own distinct iden-tity, we say that it has become assimilated.The ability of one group to establish control over another is usually due to technological,economic, and political factors. However, once this control has been established, it is possible forfeatures of other parts of the culture, such as religion, to flow from one society to the other.Religion may play an especially important role because a dominated culture might look for reli-gious explanations for what is occurring and the dominating group might use religious justifica-tions for its actions."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"232Chapter 11 • The Search for New MeaningSome societies are very receptive to new religious ideas and are able to graft them ontotheir own religion. Why not add what appears to be a powerful foreign god to the existingpantheon? It can’t hurt. For example, the Christian God often becomes yet another god in thepantheon, and selected elements of Christian ritual may be incorporated into traditional rituals.To those living in the Western world this incorporation of elements from one religion intoanother might seem strange. Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are exclusionary in that membersof these religions are excluded from practicing rituals of other religions. When a person converts,he or she gives up all former religious beliefs. However, we saw in Chapter 9 how even thesereligions adopted some beliefs of the surrounding cultures during their development.In many societies, people practice rituals from different religious systems more on thebasis of need that anything else. For example, in Japan someone might travel to a Shinto shrineto ask for blessings on the family, be married in a Christian ritual, and be buried in a Buddhistritual. Small-scale societies often are able to assimilate new religious practices with a degree ofease. However, Christian missionaries, for example, demand exclusion. One of the most stressfulaspects of the presence of missionary activity is the pressure to give up one’s former religion.SYNCRETISM.The process of acculturation does not always involve the complete replacement ofone trait by anotheror the complete acceptance of a new trait. There often is a reworking of the traitthrough a process known as syncretism. Syncretismis a fusing of traits from two cultures to formsomething new and yet, at the same time, permit the retention of the old by subsuming the old into anew form.Previously in this text we have seen several examples of syncretism, such as the origins ofHalloween and the Day of the Dead. Other examples include the syncretism of Shinto andBuddhism in Japan and that of Christianity and indigenous religions in Africa. In this section wewill be looking at entire religious systems that were formed through the process of syncretism.Haitian VodouVodou is a religion that is found in the country of Haiti and in the Haitian diaspora. It is a reli-gion that is extremely rich in symbolism, with art and dance playing central roles in ritual. Vodougrew out of several religions indigenous to West Africa, especially the religions of the Fon,Kongo, and Yoruba peoples. The term vodoucomes from the Fon language of Dahomey (nowBenin) and means “spirit” or “deity.” However, the term is used largely by outsiders to describethis religion. Practitioners merely say that they “serve the spirits.”HISTORY OF VODOU.The country of Haiti occupies the western third of the Caribbean island ofHispaniola, which was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492. In 1697, Haiti became aFrench colony. (The rest of Hispaniola today is the Spanish-speaking country of the DominicanRepublic.)The French colony of Haiti eventually became one of the richest colonies in the Caribbean,largely because of plantation agriculture dedicated to sugar cultivation and activities related tosugar, such as the production of molasses and rum. Because sugarcane cultivation is very laborintensive, large numbers of slaves were brought from Africa.The slaves soon outnumbered the French colonists, who lived in constant fear of slaverebellions. In the late seventeenth century, the French government decreed that all slaves had tobe baptized and instructed in the Catholic religion. Yet, other than a baptism ceremony, slaveswere given little or no religious instruction, because few landowners allowed priests on their land"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning233for this purpose. Over time the slaves became vaguely aware of the most basic tenets ofCatholicism, but they continued to practice their African religions.In 1790 the feared slave revolt came to pass. After a prolonged struggle Haiti, the firstblack republic in the New World, declared its independence in 1804. The establishment of arepublic formed of ex-slaves was not popular with its neighbors, and diplomatic recognition waswithheld for some time. As a result Haiti became isolated from the rest of the world. The Vaticanrecalled its priests in 1804 and broke off relations with Haiti; Catholic clergy did not return until1860. It was during this period of isolation that Vodou developed.Haiti is nominally a Catholic country, although many Protestant churches have been estab-lished. Yet Vodou remains strong, and the majority of professed Catholics—and indeed manyProtestants—also practice Vodou.VODOU BELIEFS.Vodou is in many ways a West African religion. It worships many of thesame deities, and Vodou rituals closely resemble African rituals. Haitian Vodou has a pantheonof deities called lwa,which are similar to the orishaof the Yoruba (see Chapter 9). Altars areconstructed containing objects that are infused with spirits, and offerings and sacrifices are madeto appease the lwa(Figure 11.1). Dance and music play major roles in Vodou ritual.FIGURE 11.1Vodou Altar.This replica of a Vodou altar was set up as part of the exhibit “Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou” at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

The two most important are the Rada andthe Petwo nanchon,or nations. The Rada nanchonconsists of deities that would be very familiarto a Yoruba. These are African deities and are thought to be very ancient. In contrast are thePetwo lwas.They are aggressive and assertive, born out of the slave experience. Many firstappeared during the period of isolation in the early nineteenth century. Another important groupof lwasare those associated with death.Table 11.1 lists some of the more important lwa.However, the situation is much morecomplicated than is shown in the table, because many deities appear in different manifestations.Each deity has a particular personality, domains over which he or she rules, and particularsymbols. These symbols include not only physical objects and artistic motifs, but also particularTABLE 11.1The Lwaof Haitian VodouLwaRoleSymbolsSeen asColorsLegbaAs the guardian of thethreshold betweenhumans and thesupernatural, Legba isthe first lwato begreeted in ritualCrutches, pipe,roosterSt. PeterOrange,yellow, redDanbalaandAyidaWèdoLwaof rainfall andfertility, Danbala is theoldest of the lwa;hiswife is the rainbowspiritSerpent, rainbow,lightning bolts,bishop’s attireSt. PatrickWhiteAgweProtector of ships atseaRitual boat, shells,admiral’s attireSt. Ulrich holdinga fishGreenEziliDantòLwaof fertility andmotherhood; protectorof mothersHeart, knife, blackpigThe BlackMadonnaMulticolorEziliFredaLwaof love and luxuryHearts, flowers,dovesMadonna ofSorrowsPink, whiteGedeLwaof death; healer,trickster deityCross, skull andcross bones, tophat, sun glassesmissing one lensSt. GabrielBlack, purpleAzakaLwaof agricultureStraw hat, strawbag, pipeSt. IsidoreGreen, white,denimLasirènFemale lwaof the sea;brings luck andmoney; patron deity ofmusiciansMermaids, fish,mirrorSt. Martha with adragonBlue, whiteOgouLwaof war andmilitary might;protector of carsFire, iron, swordsSt. JamesRed and blueof Haitianflag"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning235ways of speaking and music and dance movements. Each lwais known to be partial to certainfoods that are used as offerings. In general, the Rada lwalike things that are “cool,” such ascandies and sweet drinks; the Petwo lwalike things that are “hot,” such as strong drinks like rumand spicy foods.An example of syncretism is the association of particular lwawith Catholic saints andmanifestations of the Virgin. Symbolism in the chromolithographs(colored posters) used byearly priests who attempted to bring Christianity to the slaves was seen as symbolic of thedeities. Perhaps the oldest and most venerated of the deities is Danbala, the Rada serpent deity.His domain is rain, fecundity, and wisdom. Danbala is depicted as Saint Patrick, who is picturedon the chromolithographs with snakes at his feet. In Vodou art, Danbala is often seen with hiswife Ayida Wèdo, the rainbow serpent.SanteriaOther religious movements, similar in form and function to Vodou, developed throughout theCaribbean, Brazil, and other parts of the New World where slaves were imported to work thelarge plantations. Santeria developed in Cuba from a fusion of West African religions, primarilyYoruba and Spanish Catholicism.Slavery lasted longer in Cuba than in Haiti. Independence of this last Spanish colony in theNew World occurred, with the aid of the United States, in 1898. By this time, there were a largenumber of freed slaves as well as communities of freed slaves in remote mountainous areas andvarious mutual aid societies and social clubs in urban areas. Santeria developed out of thesesocieties, and today it has spread to other areas in the New World, including the United States. Inthe United States in areas with large Hispanic populations, such as Los Angeles, the religion ismost often seen in the context of Botanicas, or stores that sell charms, herbs, and other materialsused by followers of the religion.Santeria deities, called by the Yoruba name orisha(Chapter 9), show the same syncretismas the Haitian lwa.The orisha,known by their Yoruba names, are associated with particularsaints: Ogun is Saint Peter, Obatala is Saint Mercedes, and Shango is Saint Barbara.Although Santeriais the name by which this religion is now most commonly known, thename was originally pejorative, used by the Spanish to note what they saw as an unusual amountof attention being paid to the Catholic saints as opposed to Jesus Christ. The proper name for thereligion is Regla de Ocha,or Rule of the Orisha, although Santeria is used as well. The religionis also known for being secretive. Relatively little information about beliefs, rituals, and symbolsis released to the general public.One reason for the secrecy is the use of animal sacrifice in ritual, which has led to conflict be-tween practitioners of Santeria and political authorities in the United States. The issue is whether an-imal sacrifice should be permitted as part of the First Amendment protection of the free exercise ofreligion or whether it should be banned under statutes preventing cruelty to animals. The matter hasnot been resolved, but most U.S. police organizations have become more understanding and permis-sive about this practice, and the courts have generally upheld the right to practice animal sacrifice.REVITALIZATION MOVEMENTSSocieties that are situated next to each other experience diffusion, the flow of culture traits that arethen adjusted to fit into the receiving culture. This is especially true if the two societies are roughlyequal in terms of technology and economy. However, the situation often arises, especially intoday’s world, in which one culture is able to establish economic and political dominance and"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"236Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaningsuperimpose itself on another. The situation can be a direct takeover, as when one society conquersanother and maintains economic, political, and military control, or it can be indirect, as when amissionary or an economic enterprise—a shoe factory, for example—shows up in a community.A missionary or factory manager might not have the political power of a conquering state but stillrepresents a more technologically advanced society with things that people learn to want and need.The flow of events differs in each situation, but generally speaking, a massive introductionof items from a dominant culture can have a dramatic effect on the receiving culture. The endresult could be the destruction of a culture. The people might survive, but they end up becominga mere reflection of the dominant culture, living on the fringes of that culture. Moreover, demor-alization manifests itself in many maladaptive behaviors.One society might be totally assimilated into another, it might simply disappear as an entity,or it might exert itself and become a viable subculture within the larger culture. Frequently, how-ever, there is a reaction that often manifests itself as a religious or secular movement known as arevitalization movement. (This is not the only situation in which revitalization movementsarise. They can also result from some environmental disaster such as a drought or epidemic.)A revitalization movement is one that forms in an attempt to deliberately bring about changein a society. The change is perceived as more bearable and satisfactory to those under pressure. Themovement may be secular, but they are very frequently religious movements, complete with mythol-ogy, ritual, and symbolism, and may result in the formation of a new religion. These are deliberateactivities, frequently initiated by an individual or a small group that promises better times and solu-tions to the problems that besiege the community or are perceived as a threat to the community.Revitalization movements arise from a number of perceived stressful and often traumaticsituations. These situations include political and economic marginalization (loss of effectivepolitical participation), economic deprivation and poverty, and malnutrition and high levels ofchronic or epidemic diseases. There may also be less tangible stresses within the social structurethat arise when a culture is discriminated against by the dominant society and when there is aperception that the values of the community are being threatened.The Origins of Revitalization MovementsAnthony Wallace describes several stages in the development of a revitalization movement.1In theearly stages of contact or other stressors, change is occurring, but at an acceptable rate, within rela-tively normal levels. Over time, the stress levels become intolerable to some people. This phase ischaracterized by an increase in illness, alcoholism and drug use, and crime. For many individuals,although these behaviors are dysfunctional, they serve as a temporary adjustment to change.Increasing exposure to the dominant society and the increasing influx of new traits, manyof which cannot easily be integrated into the existing culture, increase the amount of stress on theindividual. Means of livelihood may be restricted, and new economic patterns may emerge thatare not consistent with the ideals of the culture. For example, individualized wage labor mayreplace family-based economic activities with the effect of tearing the family apart and increas-ing the isolation of individuals. Alcoholism, drug use, and crime may become endemic as normalsocial relationships within the society break down. Sometimes the dominant culture deliberatelyattempts to destroy the indigenous religious pattern (often by ridicule and destruction of sacredobjects and sacred spaces), and attempts may be made to substitute the religious practices of thedominant culture for those of the subordinate one. However, not all such movements are reli-gious. They can be political, such as many of the elements of the Celtic revival in Ireland or theCommunist movements in many countries."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning237At this stage the society may disintegrate and cease to exist as a separate unit, with themembers of the society assimilating into the dominant social group (often at the margins of thatgroup). However, another possibility is revitalization. Revitalization begins when an individualor a small group constructs a new, utopian image of society and establishes a model of thisimage. At the same time the dominant social group becomes contrasted as evil. The founder ofthe movement may be a charismatic leader or prophet, and the story that establishes the legitima-cy of the movement is often thought of as supernatural.People who join the movement think of themselves as being elected to a special status, andattempts are made to bring more people in the fold. Although somewhat flexible at first, overtime the philosophy and rules become set, and the group sets itself off, often with great hostility,from the main society. At this point, the movement, if successful, becomes firmly establishedand relatively stable. The movement can become part of the mainstream, having successfullybrought about a change in the culture. Or the movement may remain an isolated one that eitherpersists or eventually disappears, often in a dramatic and terrible way.Types of Revitalization MovementsWe can recognize several types of revitalization movements. Nativistic movementsdevelop insocieties in which the cultural gap between the dominant and subordinate cultures is vast. Thesemovements stress the elimination of the dominant culture and a return to the past, keeping thedesirable elements of the dominant culture to which the society has been exposed, but with theseelements now under the control of the subordinate culture.Revivalistic movementsattempt to revive what is often perceived as a past golden age inwhich ancient customs come to symbolize the noble features and legitimacy of the repressed culture.For example, the Celtic revival in Ireland stressed the revival of ancient Celtic customs and providedsymbols of rebellion against the occupying British. Once the Irish Republic gained independence,many items from the past became symbols of a new national identity, such as the revival of theCeltic language, arts and crafts, and place names. In addition to these secular examples, some neo-pagan groups have also attempted to revive ancient Celtic religious practices. Many of the neo-paganmovements discussed later in this chapter would be considered revivalistic.Millenarian movementsare based on a vision of change through an apocalyptic transfor-mation; messianic movementsbelieve that a divine savior in human form will bring about thesolution to the problems that exist within the society. Of course, these four types are not alwaysclearly differentiated from one another, and elements of one may appear in another. We willexamine examples of these types in the following sections.Cargo CultsThe term cargo cultcomes from the word cargo,which in the pidginEnglish spoken in NewGuinea and the islands of Melanesia means “trade goods.” (The culture area of Melanesiaincludes New Guinea and the islands to the east, including the Trobriand Islands.) Thesemovements began along the coast in the late nineteenth century but reached their peak during andafter World War II, when the U.S. military brought in large quantities of manufactured goods.When the first outsiders entered this region, explorers, missionaries, and colonialadministrators brought with them a wealth of manufactured goods that sparked the imaginationsof the native peoples and became highly desirable items. The newcomers were seen as conduitsfor the goods, and the outsiders were perceived as being very powerful. In the context of the nativeculture, power comes from knowledge of the supernatural. Thus the activities of the missionaries"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"238Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaningresonated with the population, and much of the interest in the newly introduced Christianity wasan interest in discovering the ritual secrets that the missionaries used to bring the cargofrom overthe sea from the Land of the Dead.Soon it became clear to the local peoples that the key to controlling the cargowas not to bediscovered through Christian rituals because the missionaries refused to share the magicalsecrets with them. Other negative factors included the Europeans’ unwillingness to share manyof their goods with the natives, the condescending way the Europeans treated the natives, and theappearance and behavior of the Europeans.This disillusionment led to the emergence of a number of stories that explained what thelocal people were experiencing. The main puzzles were the origin and control of the cargoandthe power of the outsiders. The Europeans did no obvious work and engaged in a number of verystrange activities. The manufactured goods must have been made in the Land of the Dead by theancestors of the Melanesians. The Europeans, through ritual, intercepted the airplanes and stolethe cargothat was meant for the local people.The solution to the problem was to discover and learn the Europeans’ magic. Then thepeople could rid the land of the outsiders and permit the ancestors to land the planes andbring the cargodirectly to their descendants. This would also usher in a period of paradiseon earth and, in some cases, the return of the ancestors. To accomplish this goal, theMelanesians carefully examined the behavior of the Europeans to find a clue to theirpowerful magic.Several cargo cults emerged over the years. They often appeared in response to a prophetwho had dreams or who had otherwise discovered the secret used by the Europeans in control-ling the cargo.These movements utilized activities of the Europeans as the basis of ritual, butthese European behaviors were terribly misunderstood. The activities, seen as magic rituals,varied from place to place. They included making marks on paper, running flags up poles,marching with sticks over their shoulders, and dressing up in European-style clothes and sittingaround a table with a vase of flowers in the center. One group cleared a long strip of land inimitation of a landing strip, complete with a control tower.As sad as these things are, they are overshadowed by another aspect of the cargo cults.In some movements the prophet announced that the ancestors and the manufactured goodswould not appear until the people destroyed their traditional sacred objects or exposed theseobjects to people who were not supposed to see them, such as women and uninitiated boys. Inother movements success would not happen as long as the people had adequate food, so pigsand crops were destroyed. The results were tragic.One of the best known of the early cargo cults was the Vailala Madness, whichoccurred between 1919 and 1923. It centered on divination trances. Old rituals wereset aside, and new rituals, containing many Christian elements and military-style activities,appeared. For example, messages from the dead could be received through flagpoles. In 1932and 1933 another cargo cult emerged among the Buka people. They believed that steamshipswould arrive with cargo,and a large warehouse was built to store these manufactured goods.However, the steamship would not arrive as long as the people had food, so they destroyedtheir farms.The Naked Cult of 1944 through 1948 featured the cult members going around naked andfornicating in public. Other elements included the destruction of villages and things receivedfrom the Europeans. People stopped working for the Europeans and waited for the arrival of theAmericans, which would mark the beginning of the period when the followers of the prophetwould receive the cargo.A modern cargo cult is described in Box 11.1."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning239BOX 11.1The John Frum CultCargo cults are small-scale religious movements that have been associated with culture contact inNew Guinea and many of the islands of the southwestern Pacific. While we can look at these cultsas historical religious movements, at least one is quite active today and has been for over fiftyyears. Every February 15, the people of the island of Tanna celebrate John Frum Day. Tanna is apart of the nation of Vanuatu, formerly the New Hebrides, in the western Pacific.The John Frum cult is based upon a prophet who is said to have appeared in the 1930s. It isnot known if John Frum was a real person or not, or whether he was a native or a European.However, he is said to have predicted the Japanese invasion and the subsequent arrival of theAmerican military in World War II.John Frum is said to have prophesized the good age in which the white man, including themissionaries, would disappear followed by an influx of manufactured goods. In order to bringabout this new era, in the early 1940s the people of Tanna rejected European customs such asEuropean money and Christianity, and returned to the traditional Tannese kastom(customs). Thenthe American army arrived. The people of Tanna were astonished by the wealth and power of theAmericans and saw the United States as a source of cargo. Today, on John Frum Day, men marchin military fashion—as they comprehend it—and raise American flags. They carry bamboo riflesand use a red cross as a sacred symbol. It is believed that on some future February 15, John Frumwill return bringing with him manufactured goods or cargo that rightly belongs to them.The Ghost Dance of 1890The policies of the U.S. government toward Native Americans in the late nineteenth centurywere those of forced assimilation. This was facilitated by the destruction of traditional foodresources, restriction of communities to small tracts of land and reservations, and forced educa-tion at boarding schools for children, where they were forbidden to speak their language or prac-tice their culture. Many communities were moved great distances onto land that was insufficientin amount and fertility to feed the community. The results were poverty, starvation, crime, alco-holism, and the breakup of the family and other traditional social patterns. It is not surprising thatone of the ways in which the people reacted to these activities was through the development ofnativistic movements.Early in 1889 a Paiute named Wovoka (?1858–1932), who lived in Nevada, had a vision.Wovoka was illiterate and never kept a journal or wrote letters and, after December 1890, nevergave interviews. What follows is the essence of what occurred.Wovoka received a “Great Revelation” on New Year’s Day in 1889. He moved into an alteredstate of consciousness for a period of time, awakening during an eclipse of the sun. (This was inter-preted by some as death followed by rebirth.) Wovoka then told the people that he had been to Heavenand talked with God. He had visited with his dead ancestors, who were once again young and healthy.God had told Wovoka that the Indians were no longer to lie, steal, fight, or drink alcohol. Wovoka hadthen been given a traditional dance that lasted three (or five) nights. If people followed the rules andfaithfully performed the dance, they would go to Heaven, where they would once again be young."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"240Chapter 11 • The Search for New MeaningAlthough this aspect of the vision appears to be a positive adaptation to the changes thathad occurred, there was a great deal more to the vision. Wovoka told of an apocalypse duringwhich new earth would cover the world, burying the Whites, followed by a return of the land andanimals, including the buffalo, to their original condition. The Indians would inherit this land,and the dead would return to the earth—hence the name the Ghost Dance.Although the new religion incorporated many Native American traditions, such as medita-tion, prayer, and ritual cleansing, it also incorporated many Christian elements. The vision itselftook place in a Christian Heaven. Wovoka had spent time as a young man on the Wilson ranch.The Wilsons were devout Christians—specifically, Presbyterians—and they undoubtedlyexposed the young Wovoka, or Jack Wilson, as he was also known, to Christianity. The GhostDance religion included many examples of syncretism.In the fall of 1890, news of Wovoka’s vision had spread eastward and had reached the reser-vations of the Sioux living on the northern Plains. A delegation traveled to Nevada, where theyjoined hundreds of native people who had traveled from many different tribes to see Wovoka.Wovoka met with the delegations and told them of his visions and taught them the dance.The Sioux delegation returned to their reservations and told the people what they had seenand what they had been told. On receiving the news, the Sioux began to congregate in largenumbers to dance the Ghost Dance. These gatherings alarmed the local government agents.Finally, the militia was called out to break up the dancing, and the Sioux fled into the country-side, where they were rounded up and returned to the reservations.As part of these operations, the militia found and surrounded a large group camped by acreek in South Dakota called Wounded Knee. On December 29, 1890, while tensions were high,the shaman Yellow Bird urged the people to resist the soldiers. He reminded the warriors that theGhost Dance religion preached that the bullets from the enemy would not penetrate the “ghostshirts” that they wore. A young warrior then drew his rifle from under a blanket and fired on the sol-diers. Immediately, the militia opened fire on the group, using bullets and two-pound shells; withina few minutes more than 200 men, women, and children lay dead. Even today, over 120 years later,this event colors the relationship between Native American groups and the U.S. government.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormonism)Many new religious movements emerged in the United States in the early nineteenth century. Itwas a time of great stress and crisis for a country that was heading into a Civil War. TheIndustrial Revolution was bringing with it many changes in traditional lifestyles, including themovement of many people to cities and the subsequent breakdown of old ideas of community.The proliferation of many different Christian sects, or new branches of a mainstream religion,led to choice fatigue, as a single dominant church was replaced by numerous options. Out ofthis stress grew many revitalization movements, including the Shakers, the Seventh DayAdventists, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS). Today, LDS is thefastest-growing faith group in U.S. history and claims to have more than twelve million mem-bers worldwide.The LDS Church was founded by Joseph Smith (1805–1844). He grew up in New York,where his family were “seekers”—what we might call nondenominational Christians. Smith wasvery troubled by the number of Christian sects that existed at the time and wanted to know whichwas the true Christianity. Smith received his first vision at the age of fourteen. In this vision Godand Jesus came to him and told him that all of the various sects were in error and that he shouldnot join any of them."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning241A few years later, when Smith was seventeen, he had three visitations from the angelMoroni to prepare Smith, as a prophet, to restore the true Christian Church. Moroni revealed tohim the location of golden tablets on which was written additional biblical history. Smith was ableto use special stones buried with the tablets to translate them into what is now known as the Bookof Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.This book did not replace the Christian Bible butrather supplemented it. The book is named after Mormon, an ancient prophet who compiled thesacred record, and is the source of the name Mormonsfor members of the LDS church.The early LDS Church was heavily persecuted. In 1844, Smith was jailed for hisdestruction of an opposition printing press in Illinois. While he was in jail, a mob attacked thejail and killed Smith and his brother. His death provoked a crisis in the group. However, Godsent a revelation that Brigham Young would be the next leader of the group. It was Young wholed them to what became Salt Lake City, Utah. There, the LDS Church encountered difficultieswith both the Native Americans who were already living in the area and the U.S. government,which refused Utah recognition as a state because of the LDS practice of polygamy. Utahfinally received statehood after an 1890 church revelation from God that disallowed pluralmarriages.In some ways LDS beliefs are similar to those of evangelical Christianity, including theliteral truthfulness of the Bible, atonement, resurrection, and tithing. However, there are alsosignificant differences. For example, while most conservative Christians believe that salvation isbased on faith alone, Mormons believe that salvation also requires good works. In Chapter 9 wediscussed the difficulties of the concept of the Trinity for monotheistic Christianity. Here, too,the LDS Church differs. The deity is seen as being Trinitarian; God, Jesus, and the Holy Spiritare seen as three separate entities, God and Jesus being separate deities of flesh and bone. Smithdescribed God as self-made, as finite, and as having a material body. The Holy Spirit is seen as aSpirit Personage.Another obvious difference is the additional biblical texts in the Book of Mormon.Thehistory related there says that a group of Israelites departed from the Middle East around 600B.C.E., before the time of the Babylonian captivity, and came to North America. This included apatriarch, Lehi, and his two sons, Nephi and Laman. Two tribes, the Nephites and Lamanites, aredescended from the sons. The two groups lived in a state of continual feuding, and eventually, theLamanites killed off the Nephites (around 385 C.E.). The Book also says that after his resurrec-tion, Jesus came to North America, where he performed miracles and delivered sermons. He alsoselected twelve disciples from among the Nephite tribe.The Mormons believe that these are the same doctrines that were held by the very earlyChristian Church. They believe that they are restoring the original church of the apostles to howit was in the first century of the Common Era.NEO-PAGANISM AND REVIVALThe term neo-paganismrefers to pre-Christian religious traditions that have been revived and arepracticed in contemporary times, an example of revivalistic movements. One of the best knownof the neo-pagan religions is the Wiccan religion.The Wiccan MovementThe beginnings of the Wiccan religion can be traced to the publication of several importantbooks. The first was The Witch Cult in Western Europe,written by anthropologist MargaretMurray in 1921. In this book Murray examined the Witchcraze, which is referred to by"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"242Chapter 11 • The Search for New MeaningWiccans as “the Burning Times.” She focused on what she believed to be the connection ofthe Witchcraze to the persecution of practitioners of pre-Christian religions. She believed thatthere was an unbroken line between pre-Christian goddess-based religions and women whowere labeled as witches. This claim is very controversial, and most Wiccan practitionerstoday see their religion as a reconstruction, not a continuation, of earlier practices. Thetiming of the publication of the book importantly coincided with the suffragist movement inthe United States, an early feminist movement that centered on gaining for women the rightto vote. The idea of a pre-Christian religion that valued and worshipped women was appeal-ing, and a return to such religious practices fit in well with ideas of female empowerment.The Wiccan movement took off in the 1950s. This was largely due to the work of GeraldGardner (1884–1964), who wrote Witchcraft Today(1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft(1959). Gardner was an amateur anthropologist who, in 1908, studied the Dyaks of Borneo.Gardner continued Margaret Murray’s idea that witchcraft was a pre-Christian religion inBritain. Gardner then went on to say that he had found and joined a coven of witches whom hebelieved to be among the last remnants of this old religion.WICCAN BELIEFS AND RITUALS.There is much variety in Wiccan beliefs and practices. Herewe will discuss some of the most common features. Wicca is a polytheistic religion, althoughwhich of the pagan gods and goddesses are named varies. Gender equality—the god and thegoddess—are stressed, as is nature as a manifestation of deity.The religion is in many ways nature-based and includes a ritual calendar. One set ofrituals is performed at full moons and is associated with the goddess. There are also eightSabbats, or solar festivals, related to the god. The Sabbats happen seasonally and are relatedto such events as times of planting and harvesting. They also are seen as symbolic of eventsin the life of the god and goddess. The Sabbats include Samhain (the New Year festivaldiscussed in Chapter 8, the death of the god), Yule (the Winter Solstice, rebirth of the godthrough the goddess), Imbolc (February 1, associated with purification and fertility), Ostara(the Spring Solstice), Beltane (April 30, when the young god becomes a man), Midsummer(when powers of nature are seen as being at their peak), Lughnasadh (beginning of theharvest), and Mabon (the second harvest, the waning of the god).The rituals themselves are varied but often begin with the casting of a circle to create asacred space. After the circle is cast, invocations are recited to the four cardinal directions(Figure 11.2). As part of this, or after this, the gods and goddesses are invoked to observe theritual. From this point, the ritual will vary according to its purpose. Common elements includesinging and chanting, the manipulation of symbols, and a ritual meal.Common Wiccan symbols include images or candles to represent the god and goddess.The athame, or ritual knife, and wand are commonly used to cast the circle. Cauldrons and cupsare symbolic of the goddess. A broom may be used to sweep and thus purify an area. The penta-cle is another Wiccan symbol (Chapter 3).The use of magic is also characteristic of Wiccan religion. This includes both folk magicand ritual magic. Contrary to common misperceptions, all magic in Wicca is to be used forgood and never for evil. This can be seen in the Wiccan Law of Return. A karmalike idea, thislaw says that whatever good you do will return to you, as will any evil. There are severalvariations on this, such as the Three fold Law, which says good and evil will return threefold,and the Ten-fold Law, which says that good and evil will return tenfold. Wiccans also have amoral rule known as the Wiccan rede. In essence, this rule says that you can do whatever youwant as long as it does not harm anyone."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning243FIGURE 11.2Wiccan Ritual.Saluting the four cardinal points during a Wiccan ritual.THE GROWING POPULARITY—AND PERSECUTION—OF WICCA.Although exact numbers ofadherents are difficult to come by, Wicca has expanded rapidly, primarily in North America andEurope. The religion has also recently gained important official recognition. The U.S. ArmedForces chaplain’s handbook now contains a section on Wicca, and Wiccan practitioners havewon court cases affirming the right to practice the religion in jail.Wicca has many features that make it appealing, especially to young women. Theseinclude the lack of sexist beliefs and discrimination in general and a focus on the female aspects,or the goddess. A concern for nature and the environment also fits in well with modern ideas.Whereas for some the morality of traditional religions seems excessively restrictive, Wicca has asingle moral rule (the Wiccan rede). The practice of Wicca is very flexible and allows for person-al involvement. Individuals can practice the religion alone or within a group and are free to addtheir own symbols and rituals as they see fit.Wicca has also appeared in many popular media presentations in recent years. However,despite the growing numbers of Wiccan practitioners and the increasing media exposure, Wiccaremains a religion that is largely misunderstood. Practitioners are often persecuted and thesubjects of hate crimes. Some of this misunderstanding comes from the Wiccan use of the termwitchand symbols such as the pentacle, which for most North Americans and Europeans havestrong negative connotations; they see these as signs of devil worship. For Wiccans the idea of adevil is a Christian notion, and so they have no connection with it. (See Box 10.3 for a discussionof Satanism.)Wiccans choose to use the term witchbecause for them it has a different but importantmeaning and connotations. For them, witchwas a term that was unfairly applied to pagans, heal-ers, and people who practiced an age-old tradition of folk magic. To call themselves witches isseen as reclaiming the term and reaffirming their heritage."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"244Chapter 11 • The Search for New MeaningNEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTSNew religious movements have generally branched off of older, more established religions andthus have many features in common with the older, mainstream religion. If the new group is stillconsidered mainstream and differs on just a few points from the mainstream religion, it isreferred to as a denomination. Examples of Christian denominations are Baptist and Lutheran;Islamic denominations would include Sunni and Shi’a. A sect is even more different from theolder religion than a denomination is. Although still connected to the mainstream religion, sectsare generally associated with a founder or leader and new revelations. Examples of Christiansects include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, discussed earlier. There are realchallenges with the term cult. This word has several different meanings, and it is used in differ-ent ways by different people.The “Cult” QuestionHistorically, a cult is a particular form or system of religious worship. This includes specific de-votion to a particular person or thing. Thus the Catholic Church speaks of the cult of Mary.However, very few people use the term cultwith this meaning. Although there are some neutraldefinitions—such as considering a cult to be a small, recently created, and spiritually innovativegroup—most definitions are associated with more negative imagery.Even those who use the term cultwith negative meanings do not agree on what a cult is. Forexample, evangelical Christian groups, such as the Counter-Cult Movement, label as a cult anyreligious group that accepts some, but not all, of what evangelicals accept as Christian doctrines.Thus, the LDS church, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the Unification Church (discussed later) are allconsidered to be cults. However, a group such as the Wiccans does not get attention from thisgroup because they are not a Christian-derived religion. This highlights the gate-keeping issue thatoften presents itself when a new group splinters off. Who gets to decide who can call themselvesChristian? Some fundamentalist Christian groups carry this even farther and define any religionthat deviates from their beliefs—be it Judaism, Buddhism, or a UFO religion—to be a cult.On the other side is the Anti-Cult Movement. Largely composed of mental health profes-sionals, this group targets what they consider to be dangerous and authoritarian mind control(“brainwashing”) and doomsday cults. They are most concerned with what they see as deceptiverecruitment techniques and psychological techniques used to control members. The media alsoplay a large part in how religious groups are perceived. When the term cultis employed by themedia, it is most often used to refer to a small religious group with a charismatic leader who isbrainwashing his followers and is in total control of them. The group is seen as evil and usuallyas believing that the end of the world is imminent.Because of this confusion and the often negative connotations of the term, manyresearchers avoid the term cultaltogether and instead prefer the term new religious movement.However, this debate points to another area of disagreement about how some of the moreextreme new religious movements are perceived. In one point of view there is a continuum frommainstream religions to denominations and sects. High demand religionsare at the far end ofthis continuum but otherwise are no different from other religious groups and should be regard-ed as such. Others argue that these high demand groups cross the line and perhaps should not beconsidered religions at all, but rather something that masquerades as religion. Some believe thatthese groups are so far removed from the mainstream culture that they become dangerous—thenormal controls no longer are operating. Of course, the problem with this latter point of view iswho gets to decide. As it involves judging the beliefs and practices of a religious group, it is one"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning245that we will avoid in this book. Instead, we will focus on the perspective that high demand reli-gious groups are just one end of the continuum of religious expression while acknowledging thechallenges and dilemmas these groups present for the larger society.Characteristics of High Demand ReligionsAll religious groups require their members to believe certain things and to behave in certainways. All groups require some degree of conformity from their members. However, groups dovary in the level of this demand and the degree of control they attempt to exert over members.Here we will examine groups that are at the high end of this continuum.An example of a higher-end demand situation that very few would label a cult is a RomanCatholic monastery. Monks must follow a strict schedule of sleep, work, and prayer. Their diet islimited, and they often take oaths of celibacy and even silence. They must accept without ques-tion the decisions of those in authority. These are traits that are commonly associated with highdemand groups.In high demand groups the beliefs and behaviors of group members are strictly controlled.Common methods used to control beliefs include long hours of work with little or no free time, arestricted sleep schedule, strict control of access to outside information, and creation of a view ofthe outside world as unsafe and threatening. Behavior also may be controlled by public shamingand humiliation and isolation from outside contacts. Communal living is common, and membersmay be given new names and identities to signify their break with their past lives and their affil-iation with, and devotion to, the new group.Some researchers claim that the endless repetition of prayers and other techniques are in actu-ality autohypnotic techniques. For example, a person might be taught that when faced with criticismof the group, he or she should repeat a certain phrase over and over. Another area of concern forsome observers is the deceptive recruitment techniques that some groups use. Of course, some ofthese techniques are found in groups that are not considered to be high demand, and quite a few ofthem are used by organizations that are generally not questioned, such as Army boot camps.MIND CONTROL?One of the major issues surrounding high demand religious groups iswhether or not mind control or brainwashing could or does take place. A proposition of the antic-ult movement is that the pressures exerted by these groups move beyond normal social pressureand constitute a unique form of influence that can be all-controlling. However, many social scien-tists question this assertion. How is “brainwashing” different from other forms of social influenceand normal socialization? Why do we not say that people converting to mainstream groups arebeing brainwashed? Were we all brainwashed by our parents to accept the beliefs of our culturesand our religions? Are advertising, military training, and schooling all examples of brainwashing?An interesting study by Jeffrey Pfeifer looks at how we label these different areas of socialinfluence differently. In this study, people were presented with a fictional paragraph describing astudent named Bill. They were told that Bill left college either to join a Catholic seminary, to jointhe Marines, or to join the Moonies. Several high-demand techniques were described:2While at the facility, Bill is not allowed very much contact with his friends or familyand he notices that he is seldom left alone. He also notices that he never seems to beable to talk to the other four people who signed up for the program and that he iscontinually surrounded by [Moonies, Marines, Priests] who make him feel guilty ifhe questions any of their actions or beliefs."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"246Chapter 11 • The Search for New MeaningWhen asked to describe Bill’s experience, those who thought Bill joined a Catholicseminary labeled it as “resocialization”; those who thought he joined the Marines frequentlylabeled it as “conversion.” Only those subjects who thought that Bill joined the Moonies used theterm “brainwashing.”Many studies have failed to support the idea of brainwashing. Several of these have focusedon the issue of recruitment, with the idea that if these groups did have some way to override freewill and control a person’s mind, then everyone, or at least almost everyone, who attends a recruit-ment meeting for one of these groups should in fact convert. This turns out not to be the case.Sociologist Eileen Barker studied the Unification Church. She found that only a small percent-age of people who attended Unification Church recruitment seminars actually joined the church.Another study by psychiatrist Saul Levine looked at over 800 people who had joined controversialreligious movements. He found that more than 80 percent dropped out within two years. These arehardly the statistics one would expect if the groups had mind control over their members.3GENUINELY DANGEROUS RELIGIOUS GROUPS.This is not to say that there are no religiousgroups that should not be considered dangerous, either to their individual members or to thesociety at large. The question is how to identify these groups. Once we get past obvious featuressuch as torture and murder, the criteria are not all clear. And not all of these groups will even beof the high demand variety.However, there are a few characteristics that have been suggested as early warning signs ofa dangerous group. One of these is the authority claimed by the leader of the group and what thatperson does with this authority. An example is when the leader sets up ethical rules that everyonemust follow—except for the leader himself or herself. This can also extend to the leadershipdictating important personal details in the lives of followers, such as whom a person can marry.Another feature of a dangerous group is when the group sees itself as being above the lawor as not having a social contract with the secular state. Although some people place apocalypticideology on the list, this is in and of itself not necessarily a danger sign. However, when thegroup believes they will be soldiers in God’s army during this apocalypse and begin to stockpileweapons for this battle, the issues change.Examples of New Religious MovementsRecent decades in the United States have seen the development of many new religious move-ments, including several that could be labeled as high demand. Many of these movements remainunder the radar of cultural awareness, but some have come to our attention in dramatic, and oftentragic, ways. This includes the Branch Davidians and Heaven’s Gate groups.As was discussed previously, new religions do not come out of nowhere. They are derivedfrom older religious traditions. In the United States these are often Christian based. Many of thenew religions, for example, derive important elements of their ideology from the Book ofRevelation, which describes an apocalyptic world transformation.BRANCH DAVIDIANS (STUDENTS OF THE SEVEN SEALS).The Students of the Seven Sealscan be traced back to a group that broke off from the Seventh Day Adventists in the 1940s. Led byVictor Houteff, the new sect shared a number of the same beliefs as the Seventh Day Adventists,such as a belief in the imminent return of Jesus Christ. However, Houteff taught that Christ wouldreturn only when at least a small number of Christians had sufficiently purified themselves andthat he himself was a messenger sent from God to conduct this necessary cleansing. The key to all"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning247of this was secret information contained in a scroll that is described in the Book of Revelation inthe Christian New Testament, which is said to contain a description of the events that will occurwhen Christ returns and the world as we know it ends. The scroll is protected by seven seals,hence the name of the group. They are also known by the nickname Branch Davidians.After Houteff’s death, control of the group passed to his wife, who prophesied that theworld would end in April 1959. When this did not come to pass, some people did leave thegroup, but the religion persisted, with several new leaders. A man named Vernon Howell joinedthe group as a handyman in 1981 and soon married the daughter of a prominent member of thecommunity. There was a struggle for power, and Howell took control of the group in 1987. Helater changed his name to David Koresh, after the biblical King David and the Babylonian KingCyrus. By the early 1990s the group had over 100 members.Under David Koresh the group came to believe that the death of Christ had provided salvationonly for those who died before Christ did, that is, before 32 C.E. People who had died since that timecould be saved only by the actions of the current prophet. The Book of Revelation says that theLamb of God will open the seven seals and trigger the sequence that ends the world as we know it.Traditionally, Christians have made the interpretation that the Lamb of God is Jesus Christ. TheBranch Davidians believed that the Lamb of God was David Koresh himself. After the breaking ofthe seals, a battle would occur in which the Branch Davidians believed they would play a major role,hence the need for weapons. After the battle they alone would ascend to heaven to be with God.The group’s practices included many that are typical of high demand religious groups. Thegroup lived communally and led a highly regulated, disciplined life. Koresh exerted control oversuch areas as sex and marriage. Couples were separated and marriages were dissolved, andKoresh persuaded women in the group to join him as his “spiritual wives,” which included sexu-al access. Everyone else was expected to remain celibate. Members were not allowed to go to themovies or engage in competitive activities. The length of women’s dresses and their hairstyleswere regulated. Koresh himself had veto power over all decisions. The practice that brought themto the attention of the U.S. government, however, was the gathering of a large supply of weapons.In 1993, in Waco, Texas, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) decided toarrest Koresh on firearms violations. When ATF agents attempted to arrest Koresh, a firefighterupted in which six Branch Davidians and four agents died. A fifty-one-day siege followed.Finally, federal agents fired tear gas grenades and used tanks to try to penetrate the building.Several fires had started in the compound, and Koresh and at least seventy-five of his followers,including twenty-one children, died.Much has been written about the events of Waco, and much remains unclear. However, onefactor is that the federal officials failed to take the Branch Davidians’ religious beliefs seriouslyand to consider this as a factor in their strategy. Koresh apparently believed that the raid was thestart of the war of Armageddon, which he believed was to begin with an attack on the BranchDavidians. This case points out the problems associated with the freedom of religion, especiallywhen the group is armed and awaiting a millenarian battle. How do we balance religious freedomagainst the need for order and security?The Branch Davidian movement has survived the death of Koresh and continues today.A small chapel was erected on the site of the siege and a group of about two dozen people stillcome to pray there every Sunday. The group anticipates that Koresh will return to earth.Based on the Book of Daniel, believers prophesized that Koresh would return in 1993 and1999. Although he failed to return on these predicted dates, the group is still waiting for himto lead them to the Promised Land. In 2004, Clive Doyle, the caretaker of the site, said in aninterview:4"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"248Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning“Our hopes are that God will intervene prior to the rest of us dying.... But we do haveto face facts: Eventually everyone gets old and dies. We worry that we will go the wayof the Shakers and other groups that didn’t get new members or have children.”“If it was all a deception, and yet we were convinced it was right, then how canwe ever know the difference between good and evil, and right and wrong?” Doyleasked. “If I was misled by God, then how would I ever believe anything ever again?”UNIFICATION CHURCH (MOONIES).The members of the Holy Spirit Association for theUnification of World Christianity are also known by the derogatory term Mooniesafter the founderof the movement, Reverend Sun Myung Moon. When Moon was fifteen years old, Jesus Christappeared to him in a vision and gave him the responsibility of completing the work that Jesus hadbegun. The Unification Church was founded in Seoul, Korea, in 1954, with the goal of unitingChristian denominations around the world and bringing unity among all major religions. Moonbelieved that this was necessary in preparation for the second coming of Christ. Missionaries weresent to Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s, but the religion did not see significantdevelopment in the United States until Reverend Moon came to the country in the early 1970s.The main beliefs of the church are contained in the text Divine Principle,which waspublished in 1973. The text tells of new truths or the new Principle that has been revealedthrough Reverend Moon. This text explicitly says that the time for the second coming of Christis the present and focuses on the family as the purpose of creation.The practice for which the Unification Church is best known is the large joint weddingspresided over by Reverend and Mrs. Moon (Figure 11.3). Some have included thousands ofpeople, and the couples are often matched up by Reverend Moon a month or less in advance.FIGURE 11.3Mass Wedding of the Unification Church.Reverend Moon performs a masswedding ceremony."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning249The Unification Church teaches that before Adam and Eve were married in Eden, Eve hadan affair with the Archangel Lucifer, which caused the spiritual fall of mankind. Eve later hadpremarital sex with Adam, which caused the physical fall of mankind. Taken together, these twoillicit sexual acts caused Adam and Eve to form an imperfect family. It was this sin that let Satantake control of the world. God’s plan, by which Jesus would redeem humanity and undo the harmcaused by Adam and Eve, was for Jesus to form a perfect marriage. However, Jesus was killedbefore he could do this. Through his subsequent spiritual resurrection Jesus would make spiritu-al salvation possible for those who believe in him. Unfortunately, physical salvation is not possi-ble because Jesus did not complete his task.Complete salvation, both spiritual and physical, will be possible only after the arrival of the“third Adam” (Jesus is seen as the second Adam) and his subsequent perfect marriage. The thirdAdam is seen as the second coming of Christ and the perfect man, who will marry the perfectwoman. Together they will become the “true parents” or the spiritual parents of humankind.Although the Unification Church has never made this official claim, many members believe thatReverend Moon and his wife, Hak Ja Han, are the True Parents.UFO ReligionsSome new religious movements have imported elements of modern technology, such as spacetravel and cloning, as a basis for a philosophy that, while not always seen as a religion tooutsiders, clearly serves as such. Most scholars consider UFOs to be within the realm of the para-normal or supernatural, thus fitting in with our definition of religion (Chapter 1). The UFOgroups describe extraterrestrial beings, or “ufonauts,” in the same way that supernatural beingsare described in more traditional religions. These beings are often seen as spiritual beings whohave come to earth to help humans in some way. They are described as wise and as havingpowers beyond those of ordinary humans.Another common religious theme is the idea of an imminent apocalypse. The world is seenas being on the verge of destruction. The “ufonauts” will somehow rescue the human race,usually preventing a nuclear war or selectively removing people from the planet to preserve thespecies. “Ufonauts” are often seen as having been involved in the original creation of humans orthe planet.As we saw in the previous section, many of the new religious movements in the UnitedStates are based in some part on the Christian religion. Even many of the UFO religions exhibitsyncretism and contain significant Judeo-Christian elements.HEAVEN’S GATE.The Heaven’s Gate movement was the last of three organizations founded byMarshall Applewhite, also known as “Do,” and Bonnie Trusdale Nettles, also known as “Ti.”Passages from the Christian Gospels and from the Book of Revelation were reinterpreted as re-ferring to UFO visitations. They saw the earth as being in the control of evil forces. However,they saw themselves as being among the elite who would be saved from the evil on earth andtaken to the next level.Members of the group lived communally in a house in San Diego. They dressed in unisexclothing and were all celibate. Eight of them, including Applewhite, had been voluntarily cas-trated. This was seen as preparation for the next life, in which there would be no sexual activityand no gender identity. Members were required to separate themselves from family and friendsand to completely detach themselves from human emotion and material possessions. Their livesfocused on following a disciplined regimen referred to as the overcoming process,through"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"250Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaningwhich they could overcome human weaknesses and prepare themselves for a physical transitionto the next kingdom.The group saw humans in a dualistic way: that the human soul was a superior entity thatwas only temporarily housed in a physical body. Much of the metaphor was that of gardening.The soul was seen as a plant in a container, but this container could be left behind, and the soulcould be replanted in another container. The Heaven’s Gate members believed that extraterrestri-als had planted the seeds of current human beings millions of years ago and were coming to reapthe harvest of this work by taking spiritually evolved individuals to join the ranks of spaceshipcrews. The members believed that by committing suicide together at the right time, they wouldleave their containers (or bodies) behind and be replanted into another container at a level abovethat of human existence.The correct time was seen as March 1997, near Easter. They believed that a spaceship washiding in the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet. Twenty-one women and eighteen men voluntarilycommitted suicide in three groups on three successive days.RAELIANS.The Raelian Movement was founded in 1973 by French race car driver and jour-nalist Claude Vorilhon, known as Rael to his followers. Vorilhon says that while walking in themountains around France, he had an encounter with space aliens, during which he was given amessage for humans about our true identity. He was told that a team of extraterrestrial scientists,the Elohim, created humans in laboratories and then implanted them on earth. Elohimis a termfound in the Hebrew Bible, where it is translated as “God.” Rael says that the word means “thosewho came from the sky.”Over the next five days, Vorilhon continued to meet with the extraterrestrials, who gavehim new interpretations of parts of the Bible. For example, the Elohim chose the earth as a placeto conduct DNA experiments, and they built laboratories for this purpose in what is now knownas the Holy Land. They first created plants, then animals, and finally humans “in their ownimage.” The humans were at first housed in these laboratories, referred to in the Bible as theGarden of Eden, but they proved to be too aggressive and were forced out.Vorilhon was also told that prophets, who are the offspring of the Elohim and humanwomen, have been sent in the past. These prophets included Buddha, Moses, Jesus,Mohammad, and Joseph Smith. Rael, as the extraterrestrials named Vorilhon, is the last offorty prophets, sent to warn humans that since the end of World War II we have entered theAge of Apocalypse. Instead of destroying themselves with nuclear weapons, humans canchoose instead to change their consciousness. This change will enable humans to inherit thescientific knowledge of Elohim. Through science, 4 percent of humans will be able to clonethemselves. After doing this, they will be able to travel through space and create life on otherplanets.Rael focuses on cloning as the only hope for immortality. Four annual rituals are held sothat the Elohim can fly overhead and record the DNA code of the Raelians. Most members areloosely affiliated with the group and acknowledge the Elohim as their fathers. The more commit-ted members join the Structure. The Structure works to further the two main goals of the move-ment: to spread Rael’s message and to build an intergalactic space embassy in Jerusalem toreceive the Elohim when they arrive in the year 2025.The Raelians have received the most attention from journalists through their organizationCLONAID and their claims to have successfully achieved human cloning. However, they havebeen unwilling to offer any scientific proof that they have in fact cloned a human being, and mostobservers believe this to be highly unlikely."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning251FUNDAMENTALISMThe last several decades have seen a declining membership in traditional religions in the UnitedStates. They have largely been replaced by a growth of membership in new religious traditions,primarily neo-pagan and New Age groups and Christian fundamentalist groups. Although funda-mentalist groups in the United States are based in Christianity, other religious traditions—namely,Judaism and Islam—also have important fundamentalist movements.The term fundamentalismoriginated in the nineteenth century. At that time it was used torefer to the opponents of liberal Protestantism who were urging a return to the “fundamentals” ofChristianity. Because of this, many non-Christian groups question the broader usage that theterm has acquired today. Again, this is an issue of insider and outsider perspectives. Althoughsome groups object to having the term fundamentalismapplied to them, from an analyticperspective we can see that these groups do have many features in common and can be referredto by the same term.Characteristics of Fundamentalist GroupsIn many ways fundamentalists groups are easier to define by what they are against than whatthey are for. These groups protest against, and fear, modernization in general and the seculariza-tion of society in specific. The world has changed dramatically in recent times. TheEnlightenment, new scientific discoveries, political revolutions such as the American and FrenchRevolutions, and a general increase in commercialization and industrialization have had a largeimpact on cultures and their worldviews. Society is no longer focused on the big questions ofmorality and salvation. Change is now prized over continuity. An emphasis on production andcommercial efficiency has replaced more traditional values. Loyalty to and identification withthe state have replaced loyalty to and identification with one’s religious group. Fundamentalistsexpress outrage at these trends.Although there are many different fundamentalist groups, they have reacted to modernizationin some similar ways. Richard Antoun describes fundamentalism “as an orientation to the modernworld, both cognitive and emotional, that focuses on protest and change and on certain consumingthemes: the quest for purity, the search for authenticity, totalism and activism, the necessity for cer-tainty (scripturalism), selective modernization, and the centering of the mythic past in the present.”5Totalismis a reaction to the increasing separation of religion from other domains of life.Fundamentalists believe that religion is relevant to, and should be a part of, all parts of a society.Religious texts play an important role in fundamentalist beliefs. Scripturalismrefers to thepractice of justifying beliefs and actions by reference to the religious text. These texts are gener-ally held to be inerrant and represent certainty and stability in a rapidly changing world. Anotheraspect of the importance of religious texts is the idea that these texts are relevant to life today,what Antoun calls traditioning.Other important themes of fundamentalist groups include millenarianism and a focus onthe perceived struggle between good and evil. These groups also are characterized by activism.Antoun points out that “Fundamentalism is inherently oppositional and minoritarian. It is theprotest of those notin power.”6It is important to note that he means political and cultural power,not necessarily economic power.Although the themes of fundamentalist groups are very similar cross-culturally, individualmovements obviously have arisen in response to very different cultural and historical circum-stances. The growth of Christian fundamentalism in the United States was a reaction to the secu-lar Protestant ideology that was very important in the early days of the country. A belief in"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"252Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaningsecular progress and ideas such as manifest destiny served to elevate nationalism to the level ofreligion. In contrast, Islamic fundamentalism is largely a reaction to Western colonialism and thegeneral outrage at the extent of Western cultural and economic infiltration into Islamic countries.And Jewish fundamentalism has its roots in reactions to the strong anti-Semitism of the late nine-teenth and twentieth centuries in eastern and central Europe.MORMON FUNDAMENTALISM.Joseph Smith, the prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter Day Saints (LDS), received the revelation regarding marriage in the early 1830s. A fewyears later he made the revelation public. It is recorded as Section 132 of The Doctrine andCovenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Containing Revelations Given toJoseph Smith, The Prophet.This revelation introduced the principle of plural marriage. This form of marriage was basedon the marriage customs of the patriarchs of the Bible, such as Abraham and Jacob, who had morethan one wife. Among the Mormons, polygamy became an obligation; some referred to it as a sacri-fice. Joseph Smith and his successors were given divine authority to perform polygamous marriages.BOX 11.2Religious Violence and TerrorismAlthough religious violence is nothing new, the last few decades of the twentieth century saw anincrease in religious violence and terrorism around the world. Some of this is linked to new funda-mentalist movements. Examples of religious violence can be found in all of the world religions andin smaller religious groups as well. Christianity is associated with attacks on abortion clinics in theUnited States and with the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, not to mention the religious conflictsin Northern Ireland. The Middle East has seen much violence perpetrated by both Jews andMuslims, including the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, Baruch Goldstein’s attack at the Tomb ofthe Patriarchs, and Hamas suicide bombers. Sikhism is associated with the assassination of IndiraGandhi, and a sect of Japanese Buddhism with the Tokyo subway gas attack. The September 11,2001, attack on the World Trade Center towers in New York and the Pentagon near Washington,D.C., is only one of many recent examples of religiously motivated violence.Much of this violence has been referred to by the term terrorism.Terrorism can be defined as,“public acts of destruction, committed without a clear military objective, that arouse a widespreadsense of fear.”aSuch acts are generally committed with a deliberately exaggerated level of violence.The violence is justified by reference to religious beliefs, including the idea that the act is part of anongoing cosmic war, a battle between good and evil. Thus those who commit the acts are seen asmartyrs to the cause; those who are attacked are defined as demons and agents of Satan.Mark Juergensmeyer argues that such acts are highly symbolic and, as such, can be ana-lyzed in much the same way that religious ritual is. For example, the timing and location of attacksare usually highly symbolic. The violence is meant to send a message, although the intended mes-sage is not always the one that the general public perceives.aM. Juergensmeyer,Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence(Berkeley: University of CaliforniaPress, 2000), p. 5"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning253Polygamy was actively practiced in secret by members of the church until 1852 whenBrigham Young brought it out into the open. Knowledge of the practice of polygamy causedgreat concern among non-Mormons, and the Federal government passed a series of laws makingits practice a crime. The government also actively prosecuted polygamists. Plural marriage wasan important factor in originally denying statehood to Utah. In 1890 the Mormons no longerentered polygamous marriages. The explanation given was that God accepted the sacrifice ofplural marriage and removed the commandment. Utah became a state in 1896. Although somepolygamous marriages were authorized after 1890, all such marriages ceased in 1904. After1904, church members were excommunicated for practicing polygamy.Not all church members accepted the end of plural marriages, and some continued the practiceafter 1904. They continued to regard polygamy as a religious obligation based upon Joseph Smith’srevelation. Because they could no longer marry within the Church, they found other ways of legit-imizing polygamous unions. In the 1920s, the groups labeled Mormon fundamentalists began toaccept the claim made by Lorin C. Woolley that he had the divine authority to solemnize polyga-mous marriages. He preached that he was the legitimate head of the Church holding the authoritypassed down from Joseph Smith. By 1934, most Mormon fundamentalists came to accept this claim.Although the practice of polygamy has been the most publicized feature of fundamentalistMormon groups, other concepts, which were articulated and practiced to a greater or lesserdegree in the mid-nineteenth century, are also found. Three of these are controversial and havebeen repudiated by the LDS church.The first is known as the Law of Consecration. Consecration refers to individuals deedingtheir property to the Church. The Church in turn assigned a certain amount of property back tothe individual to use. In the LDS Church, consecration has been replaced by tithing whereby acertain percentage of one’s income is given to the Church. However, in many fundamentalistgroups this principle is used to concentrate control of all property, including homes andfarmland, in the hands of the leader who then allows people to use the property as he sees fit. Thesecond is the prohibition against African Americans entering the priesthood. Although the LDSChurch rejected this policy in 1978, it is still practiced by fundamentalist groups.Finally, there is the practice of blood atonement. Many historians believe that this waspracticed by the early Church. Individuals were killed who committed one of many sins, includ-ing adultery, sexual intercourse between a white person and an African American, and leavingthe Church. A series of murders in the 1970s and 1980s have been attributed to fundamentalistgroups practicing blood atonement.Today the fundamentalist movement has split into a number of small, self-contained, andhighly secretive communities living in rural areas in the western United States, Mexico, andCanada. Each group is controlled by a leader who demands complete obedience. Polygamy ispracticed, with girls as young as twelve and thirteen being required to marry leaders of thecommunity. Many of these groups have been accused of illegal practices such as forcing under-age girls into marriage. These religious groups include the Fundamentalist Church of JesusChrist of Latter Day Saints, The United Order Effect, The Apostolic United Brethren, TheChurch of the Lamb of God, The Church of Jesus Christ in Solemn Assembly, and The Churchof the First Born of the Fullness of Times.ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.Most Islamic fundamentalists strictly follow teachings ofMohammed, regularly attend mosque, and promote reading and following the Qu’ran. Manypromote the concept of a theocratic government in which Islamic law (sharia) becomes the lawof the state. Most probably see the West as secular, ungodly, and decadent. While most Middle"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"254Chapter 11 • The Search for New MeaningEastern terrorists are probably fundamentalist Muslims, most fundamentalist Muslims are notterrorists. Terrorists represent an extremist, radical wing of fundamentalist Islam. However,many have conflated the two and Islamic fundamentalism has become a label used maliciouslyto stereotype people who are only strictly adhering to the fundamentals of their faith. Somehave proposed the use of the term Islamismor Islamistto avoid this problem. Since we arefocusing on the elements shared by fundamentalists group, we will stick with this label, withsome caution.Islamic fundamentalism is a movement grounded in social, religious, and economic stres-sors that exist in many Muslim countries. Since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, world history hasseen the political marginalization of these countries. The colonial context of political andeconomic domination is an important backdrop. Even after Muslim countries gained indepen-dence, Western colonialism was still seen as a problem. Most Muslim countries were ruled by aWesternized elite, mass-produced Western goods were flooding in, and Western culture wascoming in through mass media. Although great wealth came into the region in the 1970s as aresult of OPEC oil price increases, this went only to the elite and only served to accentuate therelative deprivation of the majority of people.For many Muslims, this cultural and economic domination by the outside was seen as asign of God’s wrath and a call for a return to the Qu’ran and strict adherence to its principles.Islamic fundamentalism illustrates many of Antoun’s themes described earlier, including scrip-turalism and traditioning.Perhaps the best example of the political activism aspect of fundamentalism in Islam is theIranian Revolution in 1979. This was a religious revolution against secular nationalism, led byreligious leaders and using religious idioms. An exemplar of this was the use of the myth of theImam Husayn. The Shi’a Muslims in Iran focus not on the Prophet (like Sunni Muslims do) butinstead on his descendants. According to Shi’a tradition, almost all twelve of the imams, directdescendants of the prophet Muhammad, died by violent means and at the hands of the seculargovernment in power at the time. The obvious message was that these governments could not betrusted. These stories form the backdrop for a worldview of alienation from society, and moreparticularly from the government, which is seen as unjust and illegitimate.Of these stories, particularly important is that of the third imam, Husayn, grandson ofMohammed. Before the revolution, religious devotion centered around Husayn, focused on hisrole as intercessor between humans and God. However, during the course of the revolution, anew interpretation and emphasis emerged. The story tells that in the seventh century, Husayn wason a pilgrimage to Mecca, circumambulating around the Kaaba, when he heard that his adherentsin Iraq were surrounded by an army and needed his support. He broke off his pilgrimage, one ofthe five required pillars of Islam, to go to them. In Iraq, he, his family, and his followers weremartyred. The focus now was on Husayn as a revolutionary who believed that the struggleagainst oppression was more important than even the performance of basic Muslim worshipobligations.At the time of the revolution, Iran was a constitutional monarchy ruled by ShahMohammed Reza Pahlavi. The Shah ran a strict dictatorship, complete with censorship laws andthe imprisonment of political activists. At the same time, some conditions in Iran had improvedand some rights were established. The White Revolution in the 1960s had begun a series ofsocial, economic, and political reforms that gave more freedom to women and emphasized secu-lar over religious education. These attempts to modernize Iran were undertaken with the help ofthe United States who saw Iran as a potentially stabilizing force in the region. The Shah wasopposed by many groups. Some disliked the Shah’s autocratic rule and the corruption of the very"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 • The Search for New Meaning255wealthy royal family. Religious leaders saw his rule as overly secular and tied to the West, partic-ularly the United States.The revolution against the Shah utilized the imagery of the story of Husayn.Demonstrators yelled that “Everywhere is Kerbala and every day is Ashura” (Kerbala andAshura being the place and time that Husayn was killed). The U.S. president at the time, JimmyCarter, was identified as Yazid, the ruler of the army at Kerbala, and the Shah was seen asShimr, the general sent by Yazid to kill Husayn. The United States was called the “Great Satan.”The demonstrations against the Shah followed a religiously based forty-day cycle. Theybegan on August 1, 1978, when the Shah’s forces fired on demonstrating students, killing seventy.Iranian Shi’a stipulates a major mourning ritual for the deceased forty days after death, so fortydays after these initial deaths, mourning demonstrations were mounted in several cities. TheShah’s forces retaliated, killing more. The cycle continued throughout the revolution, giving aclearly religiously based timing to revolutionary activities.On December 10, 1978, on the Day of Ashura, the day that Husayn was killed, two milliondemonstrators marched for hours. They carried flags of green, red, and black, symbolizing Islam,martyrdom, and Shi’a. By the end, a resolution was passed and Ayatollah Khomeini, living inexile, was invited to become the new leader of Iran. He returned in February 1979 and formed theIslamic Republic. Islamic law was reestablished, religious instruction was reinstituted in theeducational arena, and many new social norms were instituted, including the veiling of women,a ban on alcohol and gambling, and censoring of all media for sexual content.Iran under the new religious rule has been criticized for many human rights violations,including the imprisonment and murder of critics of the regime. Although women had gainedmany important rights under the Shah, these have all been lost. Patrols were formed to confrontwomen for such violations as wearing lipstick or showing their hair.When Ayatollah Khomeini died in 1989, he was succeeded as Supreme Leader byAyatollah Ali Khamenei, who had been president of Iran for two successive terms before that.Under Iran’s constitution, the Supreme Leader has the authority to override every other memberof government, including the president. Under Khamenei there had been reports of politicalinstability and power struggles within the Iranian government, with Khamenei being very intol-erant toward those who disagree with his anti-West and fundamentalist Islamic policies. In 2005,and again in 2009, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner of Iran’s presidential elec-tion amid allegations of voter fraud. Since he became president of Iran, conflict with the UnitedStates and the West has increased, in particular over Iran’s nuclear program.CONCLUSIONReligions exist to answer questions, to show us a culturally defined correct path, to make us feelsafe and secure in the world we live in. Any specific religion is strongly connected to the cultureand circumstances in which is it found. But what happens when those conditions change? Thereligion no longer meets these needs, needs that we require to be fulfilled. A new religion, moresuited to the new situation, is needed, and thus a revitalization movement is born. In the case offundamentalism, what might be most comforting is to attempt to return to the old ways withwhich we were once so comfortable. But both revitalization movements and fundamentalism arelikely to be popular in periods of rapid social change, when the current ways of doing and think-ing about things are no longer satisfying. Both spell out a clear path, a new path (or the return toa former one) that they say will lead people out of despair and into a better future, which willanswer questions and provide meaning to life. And in the end, isn’t that the point of religion?"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"256Chapter 11 • The Search for New MeaningSummaryCulture change occurs through the processes ofdiscovery, invention, and diffusion. Acculturationrefers to the situation whereby a culture is signifi-cantly changed because of exposure to the influ-ence of a politically and technologically dominantculture. Sometimes there is a reworking of the traitthrough a process known as syncretism, in whichtraits from two cultures fuse to form somethingnew and yet, at the same time, permit the retentionof the old by subsuming the old into a new form,such as Vodou in Haiti and Santeria in Cuba.A revitalization movement is a movementthat forms in an attempt to deliberately bring aboutchange in a society. These are frequently initiatedby an individual or a small group that promisesbetter times. We can recognize several types ofrevitalization movements. Nativistic movementsdevelop in tribal societies and stress the elimina-tion of the dominant culture and a return to the pastbut with desirable elements of the dominant culturebrought under the control of the subordinateculture. Examples are the cargo cults of NewGuinea and the Ghost Dance in the United States.Revivalistic movements attempt to revive what isperceived as a past golden age, and ancientcustoms come to symbolize the features and legiti-macy of the repressed culture. For example, Wiccaand other neo-pagan movements are attempts torevive pre-Christian religious traditions. Millenarianmovements are based on a vision of change throughan apocalyptic transformation. Messianic move-ments believe that a divine savior in human formwill bring about the solution to the problems thatexist within the society.A new religious movement that hasbranched off of a more established religion and yetis still considered mainstream is referred to as adenomination. A sect is still connected to the main-stream religion but is generally associated with afounder or leader and new revelations. The termcultis used in many ways but usually in a negativesense. Many researchers today avoid the term cultand use the term new religious movement.All religious groups require some degree ofconformity from their members. However, groupsdo vary in the level of this demand and the degreeof control the group attempts to exert overmembers. At one end of the spectrum are highdemand groups, in which the beliefs and behav-iors of group members are strictly controlled.Sometimes the activities of such groups becomedangerous to its members and to society.Fundamentalist groups are in many ways aprotest against modernization and secularization.They believe religion should be relevant to allaspects of society and perceive themselves to becaught up in a struggle between good and evil.Beliefs and actions are justified in reference to areligious text that is seen as inerrant and stillrelevant to modern life. The themes of fundamen-talism are similar cross-culturally althoughindividual movements have arisen in many differ-ent religions in response to specific historicalcircumstances.Suggested ReadingsNancy Tatom Ammerman, The Bible Believers:Fundamentalists in the Modern World(NewBrunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1987).[An ethnography of modern fundamentalists.]Richard T.
