Even a cursory reading of Professor Kennedy’s essay onCicero’s oratorical and rhetorical legacy (see Chapter 16), or a glanceat the impressive bibliography assembled by Professor Craig (Chapters17 and 18), will confirm that Cicero’s writings, despite periods whenhis popularity may have waned, have continued to be of great inter-est to many people throughout the ages and into the present. Inaddition to the scholars and the experts who have written and arewriting about him, yet another generation of Latin students followsin the footsteps of countless other generations who have studied hisspeeches and his other works as models of elegant Latin prose andeffective verbal persuasion. Indeed, there are legitimate reasons forsuch abiding interest. It is true that Cicero’s extant corpus is hugein comparison to that of most other authors whose works survivefrom antiquity; his letters, speeches, and rhetorical and philosophi-cal treatises stand as veritable mines of information about one of themost interesting and intriguing periods in all of Roman history. Thereare, however, many other prolific ancient authors whose volumes sitcollecting dust on the shelves of our libraries. The fact remains thatCicero was, to put it simply, very good at what he did: his talentat persuading an audience has been matched by few orators in his-tory, and his mastery of prose style and expression, in spite of crit-icism from ‘Atticists’ both ancient and modern, stands nearly unrivaled.Even those who are forced to rely on translations of Ciceronianprose have come to appreciate these accomplishments.The authors of the essays in this volume offer their work as acompanion to the study of Cicero’s oratory and rhetoric, for bothstudents and experts in the field. We hope that it will become avade mecum of sorts: for the neophyte, a starting point; for the vet-eran, a place for renewing the dialogue (both old and new) aboutissues concerning Ciceronian oratory and rhetoric; for all, a site ofengagement at various levels with Ciceronian scholarship and bibli-ography. Although the volume is arranged along roughly chrono-logical lines, some of the authors choose to take a thematic approachixMAY_f1_v-xiii 7/11/02 7:13 PM Page ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"to their topics. The reader should not, therefore, expect every aspectof every speech of Cicero’s to be analyzed and commented upon,though the vast majority of the extant corpus is, in some shape orform, treated in these pages. In my role as editor, I have avoidedimposing any stringent set of requirements on the authors or anysort of artificial uniformity on their contributions, nor have I attemptedto reconcile disagreements on particular issues that exist betweencontributors, which occasionally (and inevitably) crop up in the courseof their essays. If perfect consistency of approach and absolute agree-ment on issues had been the goal, it would have been better (andcertainly necessary) for one person to pen the entire volume. It ismy conviction that the strength of this companion resides in theindividual, often very original approach to sundry topics by an arrayof impressive contributors, all of whom have spent large portions oftheir careers concentrating upon the oratorical and rhetorical oeuvreof Cicero.I owe a debt of gratitude to many people. First, to the staffof E. J. Brill, in particular to Julian Deahl, Michiel Klein-Swormink,and Irene van Rossum: Julian invited me, then convinced me, toundertake this project; Michiel and Irene have seen it through to asuccessful completion. I thank them especially for their support, theirkindness, and their great patience during its composition and pro-duction. Sylvia Carullo, with characteristic generosity, offered hertime and expertise in assisting me with difficult points in the trans-lation of Professor Narducci’s essays. Donna May and Jennifer Bothunprovided invaluable help in preparing both the manuscript and thecomputer files. My colleagues in the Department of Classics at St.Olaf College have, as always, been gracious in countless ways. Finallyand most importantly, I am deeply indebted to my fellow contrib-utors, who share a love of Cicero and his works and have, conse-quently, been willing to give of their valuable time and expertise bycomposing an essay (or essays) for this volume. Among them,Christopher Craig must be singled out for his sage counsel, his invalu-able editorial assistance, and his constant encouragement, from thebeginning of this project through its completion.James M.

MayThe three elements of the traditional rhetorical triad, ingenium, ars,exercitatio—essential ingredients for the attainment of eloquence inany age—, have seldom, if ever, combined themselves as efficaciouslyas they did in the person of Marcus Tullius Cicero, the undisputedmaster of oratory in ancient Rome.1Endowed with extraordinarynatural ability, the beneficiary of an extremely broad and deep edu-cation in both rhetoric and philosophy, and a dedicated practitionerof the art, disciplined enough to burn the midnight oil in honinghis skills to near perfection (cf., e.g., Brutus312), Cicero stands asone of most successful and abidingly influential orators and rhetor-ical writers of any age. The man whose name was soon to becomesynonymous with eloquence itself (non hominis nomen, sed eloquentiae; seeQuintilian 10.1.112) left to his fellow Romans and to posterity a cor-pus of speeches that are models of both effective oratorical persua-sion and brilliantly lucid prose style. As a rhetorician, Cicero movedbeyond merely regurgitating the precepts of the handbooks, insistingin his mature works that his ideal orator be equipped with all thenoble arts, calling for a marriage between eloquence and wisdom(rhetoric and philosophy), and providing a pattern, even to this day,of what we sometimes call a ‘liberally educated person.’ The sixty-odd years of Cicero’s life and career coincide almost exactly withthe final six decades of the Roman Republic. During most of thattime, this ‘new man’ (novus homo), none of whose ancestors had ever11An exhaustive account of Cicero’s life and times would be out of place in avolume of this kind. The present essay attempts to give only a basic outline ofCicero’s life and career. For detailed analysis, the reader is directed to any of themany fine, comprehensive biographical studies on Cicero, several of which are listedin the bibliography below (21). The best ancient sources include Cicero’s own writ-ings, especially his letters and the Brutus, as well as Plutarch’s Life of Cicero.

While others might appealto the loyalty of their legions and play power politics backed by theforce of arms, Cicero could wield only the weapon of his words.Ultimately, of course, the ‘toga’ did bow to arms.2Perhaps this wasthe inevitable outcome; but in the process, the potency that the artof oratory offered to a master practitioner was eloquently illustratedand confirmed for subsequent generations.Marcus Tullius Cicero was born on 3 January 106 B.C. at Arpinum,a town approximately 70 miles southeast of Rome. His family weremembers of the local elite and, though no kinsmen had ever heldhigh office in Rome, they lived comfortably and had important con-nections in the city. When Marcus and his younger brother, Quintus,were still boys, Cicero’s father moved the family to the capital, appar-ently in order to secure for his sons the finest possible education.3In that connection, Cicero tells us (De oratore2.2) that he and hisbrother, along with two of their cousins, were received into the houseof the famous orator and statesman, Lucius Licinius Crassus, whotook an active interest in their education. In that environment, theyoung Cicero was able to interact not only with Crassus, but alsohis associates, most importantly Marcus Antonius, the other greatorator of that generation, as well as L. Aelius Stilo, the famous Stoicteacher of grammar and rhetoric. These early contacts and connec-tions proved invaluable to the young boy, and would have an abid-ing effect on the orator throughout his career (cf. De or.2.1–9).Much of Cicero’s youth was undoubtedly spent in the RomanForum, the center of Rome’s political and forensic life. There Cicerocould witness first-hand the oratory of Crassus, Antonius, and oth-ers who spoke before the courts and in public meetings. After thedeath of Crassus in 91 B.C., Cicero assumed the toga virilis, the ‘togaMAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 2"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"of manhood,’ and served a brief military stint during the Social War(War with the Italian Allies). It was during this period that he wasintroduced in a formal way to Crassus’ father-in-law, Quintus MuciusScaevola, ‘the Augur,’ who became his chief mentor, particularly inthe study of the civil law. The young Cicero’s philosophical pursuitsalso were kindled at this time. In 88, Philo of Larissa, head of theAcademy at Athens, had fled to Rome because of the MithradaticWar. Cicero, ‘filled,’ as he says, ‘with enthusiasm for the study ofphilosophy,’ dedicated himself to this teacher.4Philo’s thought wasskeptical in nature, holding that nothing could be entirely known forcertain, and he advocated debating every issue from all sides. Thisapproach appealed greatly to Cicero and would continue to exert aprofound influence on him throughout his life. A few years later,Diodotus, the Stoic philosopher, took up residence in the house ofthe young Cicero; from him, Cicero received training in diverse sub-jects, especially in dialectic (Brutus309).Thus, already as a teenager, Cicero had encountered an impres-sive array of thinkers—philosophers whose thought was representa-tive of the most important schools, statesmen, and orators, bothRoman and Greek. He was practiced in speaking and in writing,both in Greek and in Latin, and he had spent time composing andtranslating poetry. In fact, considerable fragments of his translationof Aratus’ Phaenomenaare still extant. His teenage years also witnessedthe publication of De inventione(On Invention), his first rhetorical work,most likely completed by 88 B.C. Later in life, Cicero himself woulddescribe the treatise as ‘the sketchy and unsophisticated work thatfound its way out of my notebooks when I was a boy, or rather ayouth’ (De or.1.5), but it is clear that it had been the young man’sinitial intention to write a comprehensive handbook on all parts oforatory. He apparently lost interest in the project, and completedonly two books. The important thing to note here, however, is thefact that, by age seventeen or eighteen, Cicero had already culti-vated assiduously his considerable natural ability (natura) through train-ing (ars) and diligence (exercitatio).It is somewhat surprising, then, that a young man of such intel-lect and cultivation, obviously eager to follow in the footsteps of hismentors, Crassus and Antonius, delayed his forensic debut until the4Brutus306:...totum ei me tradidi admirabili quodam ad philosophiam studio concitatus.:    3MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"age of 24 or 25. After all, Crassus, at the age of 20 or 21, had, ina rather spectacular debut, successfully prosecuted C. Papirius Carbo,one of the best orators of his generation; and Hortensius, Cicero’sgreat rival and later friend and colleague, had addressed the Senatein an impressive speech on behalf of the inhabitants of the Romanprovince of Africa when he was only 19.5At least two reasons forthis delay can be cited. Cicero’s formative years happened to coin-cide with one of the most violent and bloody decades in Rome’shistory. As Cicero ‘came of age’ in about 90 B.C., Rome wasembroiled in the War with the Italian Allies (91–87) and its after-math. Sulla’s election to the consulship in 88 was soon followed byhis march on Rome and civil war (88–87). His subsequent depar-ture for the East instigated another blood bath, upon the return ofMarius and Cinna to the city; during this time (87–84) activity inmany of the courts came to a halt or was seriously curtailed. Followingthe death of Cinna, a new civil war erupted, with Sulla ultimatelyrestoring some semblance of order (82), but again, not without pro-scription and bloodshed. The violence of this decade would neverbe forgotten by Cicero. It made a lasting impression upon him, asis evidenced in the prologue to the third book of De oratore 3.7–12,wherein with great melancholy he mourns the deaths of Crassus,Antonius, and others of his mentors and models. Needless to say,these were times not very propitious or promising for launching acareer in public speaking.An equally pressing reason for the delay must have been Cicero’sown doubts about his level of preparedness.6His penchant for exhibit-ing great caution before making an important decision or taking anycrucial action can be seen on a number of occasions througout hislife.7Now at the beginning of his career, the young Cicero obvi-ously wanted to avoid, as much as humanly possible, any chance atmaking a less than successful debut. Early on, he had chosen ora-tory as his preferred vehicle for advancement in Roman public life;5This point is made effectively by Ann Vasaly, “Cicero’s Early Speeches” (below,72–73, 98).6See C. Habicht, Cicero the Politician(Baltimore and London: The Johns HopkinsUniversity Press 1990): 19–20.7Perhaps the most vivid example of Cicero’s hesitancy is the indecisiveness hedisplayed for nearly a half a year after the outbreak of the civil war in 49; at onepoint, he actually engaged in rhetorical exercises designed to help him debate theissue from every angle; see Ad Atticum9.4.4 . MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"his brief tour of duty as a soldier under Pompeius Strabo in theWar with the Italian Allies had apparently done nothing but confirmthat decision. Thus, he would wait until he was 25 to appear as apleader in the courts; and when he did so, he would be confidentthat he had prepared himself as completely as possible for the chal-lenge. As he himself tells us, ‘it was then that I first began to under-take both civil and criminal cases, for it was my intention not tolearn in the forum (as most do), but so far as possible to come intothe forum already trained’ (Brutus311).Cicero’s first published speech dates from 81 B.C., delivered in aprivate case on behalf of Quinctius; the opposing advocate in thissuit was the most distinguished orator of the day, Quintus HortensiusHortalus. The following year, he entered the public arena in his firstcriminal case, with a striking and successful defense of Roscius fromAmeria, who had been assailed by a certain Chrysogonus, a freed-man and henchman of the dictator Sulla.8At this point, Cicerodecided (perhaps somewhat unexpectedly) to interrupt his buddingcareer as a pleader; he sailed for Greece and Asia Minor in 79.Plutarch (Cicero 3) asserts that he undertook the trip out of fear ofrecrimination from Sulla, though Cicero himself maintains that thetour was undertaken for reasons of health and further study. He tellsus (Brutus 313–314) that, at that point in his life, he was thin andlacking in strength, with a long neck and weak lungs and voice,which he had strained by speaking continually without modulationand by holding his body tense throughout his entire delivery. Deter-mined to gain strength and improve his speaking ability, he arrivedin Athens and spent six months studying philosophy with Antiochusof Ascalon, a former member of the Academy, and rhetoric withDemetrius the Syrian. He then traveled through Asia Minor, wherehe practiced declamation with the most distinguished orators of theregion, including Menippus of Stratonicea, Dionysius of Magnesia,Aeschylus of Cnidus, and Xenocles of Adramyttium. He moved onto Rhodes where he met Posidonius the Stoic, and spent consider-able time with Apollonius Molon, who effectively critiqued his speak-ing and worked to repress the youthful, and sometimes excessivelyexuberant style evident in his early speeches. Cicero described the8For these and other speeches of this period, see Vasaly, below, 71–111.:    5MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"results in this way: ‘I returned after two years’ absence not only bet-ter trained, but practically transformed. My voice was no longerexcessively strained, my language had ceased to boil, my lungs hadacquired strength, and my body had gained weight’ (Brutus316).Upon his return to Rome in 77 B.C., Cicero married, and onceagain turned his attention to pleading court cases and preparing fora political career. The next year, at 30 years of age, he was eligi-ble to run for the quaestorship, the first magistracy in the successionof political offices (cursus honorum) that culminated in the consulship.He secured election and served as quaestor in western Sicily in 75B.C., where he supervised the grain supply. His just and uprightdealings in Sicily in combination with the connections he had madethere during his service made him the Sicilians’ first choice as pros-ecutor when they initiated action against their former governor Verresbefore Rome’s standing court concerned with extortion.Verres had been governor in Sicily in 73 B.C., but served twoadditional years because of the extraordinary political circumstancesinvolved in the revolt of the slaves and gladiators led by Spartacus.During that time he was reputed to have extorted more than 40million sesterces, boasting that one year’s proceeds were enough forhim, and those gleaned from the second and third years were sufficientfor his defenders and his judges. As a member of the senatorial class,he was supported by influential members of the Senate, and defendedby Hortensius, Rome’s finest orator and, at the time, candidate forthe consulship (whom Cicero had faced earlier in his defense ofQuinctius). Cicero generally preferred the role of advocate for thedefense, but it was something of a practice in Rome for a risingpolitician to undertake the prosecution of a prominent figure in anoble cause. In this case, even while prosecuting, Cicero could againspeak for the injured and cast himself in the role of the defender ofthe downtrodden. In preparing and carrying out the prosecution,Cicero displayed incredible energy, boldness, and strategic brilliance—conducting the entire case simultaneously while a candidate for thecurule-aedileship (which he secured for the year 69). This stunningvictory (in 70 B.C.) by the aedile-elect over the consul-elect cata-pulted Cicero into the position of being one of Rome’s premier pub-lic speakers.The careful calculation with which Cicero had planned his earlycareer was mentioned above. Such calculation had proven to be notonly prudent, but, for someone of Cicero’s background, practically6 . MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"a necessity. As a young ‘new man’ (the first man of a family to enterthe ranks of the Senate) in Rome, with no ancestral deeds to com-mend his character or waxen images to decorate his halls, Cicerowas forced to operate in the society of his day under conditions fardifferent from those under which the majority of his peers operated,and he was well aware of this fact:But I am not permitted the same privileges as men of noble birth,who, even while sleeping, still see all the honors of the Roman peo-ple laid at their feet; in this state I must live under far different con-ditions and according to a very different law. (In Verrem2.5.180)9In Cicero’s Rome, a man’s character and the persona it projectedwere crucial elements for success in public life. Noble ancestry, aglorious reputation, a character full of dignity and authority wereimportant factors that could persuade people and win votes. But fora novus homo, whose birth and familial connections provided no suchadvantages, the path to prominence in the state was full of obsta-cles that must have appeared nearly insurmountable. Hard work,virtue, and industry (labor, virtus, industria) were required of a ‘newman’ in order to break into the jealously guarded ranks of the nobil-ity—and sometimes even these proved ineffectual. The story ofCicero’s early career is, most significantly, a story of the struggle ofa very gifted, very well-educated, very hard-working young ‘outsider,’fighting to establish a reputation of some authority and prominenceamong the city’s noble ‘insiders,’ a reputation that would enable himto reach his boyhood goal, ‘ever to be the best and preeminentabove all.’10His victory over Hortensius and Verres stands as oneof the most significant steps toward the realization of that goal.The decade following the Verrine affair was a particularly event-ful time for Cicero. He served as curule-aedile in 69, and was thenelected, again ahead of all of his rivals and at the youngest possibleage, as praetor in 66. In office as praetor, Cicero presided over theextortion court and presented his first deliberative oration, support-ing the proposal of the tribune Manilius to grant command of thewar against King Mithradates of Pontus (the so-called Third MithradaticWar) to Pompey (Pro lege Maniliaor De imperio Cn.

During this time, too, Cicero lost his fatherand had, himself, become a father with the birth of his son, Marcus.He continued to plead prominent cases in the courts, building a rep-utation among his fellow-citizens. All of his actions, all of his ener-gies were now aimed at securing election to the consulship suo anno,in the first year of legal eligibility. He carefully assessed the situa-tion,11and worked hard and continuously to garner support fromevery possible corner. When the election results for the year 63 wereannounced, once again Marcus Tullius Cicero’s name topped thelist. With the help of his considerable oratorical abilities, his hardwork, the support of the Roman Knights, along with substantial sen-atorial backing (gained largely by fear of Catiline’s presence on theballot), Cicero had managed to achieve something extraordinary: anovus homo, the son of a Roman knight having no noble ancestors,had secured the aedileship, the praetorship, and now the consulship,first on the ballot and at the earliest possible age—a feat that eventhe great general Marius had not performed. This accomplishmentstands as one of the defining moments in Cicero’s life and career.It invested his character with prestige and authority which he wouldsubsequently wield in his oratorical and political career.12Cicero’s remarkable rise to nobilitasand the consulship was punc-tuated in another extraordinary way as his consular year drew to aclose. Through careful attention, diligent investigation, and the for-tunate confluence of a number of circumstances, Cicero uncovereda revolutionary plot to overthrow the government, led by a disen-chanted, bankrupt senator of noble descent, Lucius Sergius Catilina,who had been a rival of Cicero’s in the consular elections. In aflurry of activity from late October to early December, Cicero man-aged to expose the conspiracy, obtain from the Senate the decree(senatus consultum ultimum) that granted extraordinary powers to theconsuls to protect the state, and secure the apprehension of severalconspirators along with crucial, incriminating evidence against them.Following a spirited debate in the Senate on December 5, the nones11Cf.

A public thanksgiving was declared andCicero was hailed as Pater Patriae(‘Father of the Fatherland’).The Catilinarian crisis had presented the consul with an arena inwhich to showcase his abilities as a leader, and he had, as it seemed,made the best of it: he not only saved the state from a serious threat,but in doing so, fashioned for himself a public persona of powerand authority, as the duxor imperator togatus(‘civilian commander’);what others had accomplished on the field of battle, Cicero hadmanaged in the forum in the garb of a citizen. Cicero makes thecomparison with great military commanders of the past and withPompey explicitly,13and shortly thereafter, he will go so far as tosuggest an alliance bewteen the imperator militaris and the imperatortogatus, the soldier and the statesman, the ‘Scipio’ and the ‘Laelius.’14Indeed, the consul’s expeditious handling of the attempted coup wasstunning enough to have provoked the envy of Pompey, and Cicerohad every right to be justly proud of his accomplishment, of whichhe boasted, as Seneca later commented, non sine causa sed sine fine.15The parvenu from Arpinum had, by the age of 43, secured for him-self a lasting place in the annals of Roman history.The Nones of December, however, did more than merely rufflethe feathers of Pompey the Great. The execution of the conspira-tors without a trial provoked the hostility of the populares(those whosepolitical power tended to derive from their influence with the com-mon people), who believed that the consul and the Senate had over-stepped the bounds of their legal authority—an hostility that would13Cf.

Only a few weeksafter the public thanksgiving decreed in his honor, when laying downhis office on 31 December, he was prevented by the tribune Q.Metellus Nepos from addressing the people in customary fashion, onthe grounds that, by executing the conspirators, he had put to deathRoman citizens without a trial. Making the best of the situation,Cicero confined himself to the oath that he had performed the dutiesof the consulship faithfully, swearing that by his efforts the city andthe state had been saved. The people roared their approval, butstorm clouds lingered on the horizon. A year later, P. Clodius Pulcher,a patrician descended from one of the noblest families of Rome,16was caught disgracefully dressed as a woman at the festival in honorof the Bona Dea, which, incidentally, had been held at the houseof Julius Caesar. In the subsequent judicial investigation, Clodius, ontrial for sacrilege, claimed to have been 90 miles away from Romeat the time. Cicero, however, had seen him in Rome within threehours of the time of his alibi, and testified to that effect. Despitethis testimony and the obvious guilt of Clodius, a bribed jury acquit-ted the perpetrator. Contributing further to the enmity between them,Cicero, on another occasion, employing his characteristic quick repar-tee and caustic wit, humiliated Clodius publicly in the Senate. Personalhatred would soon turn into public vindictiveness.At about this same time, the Senate obstinately (and shortsight-edly) snubbed the requests of three of its most powerful members,Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus, actions which led to the formation(in 60 B.C.) of the coalition among these men known generally tohistory as the ‘first triumvirate.’ Cicero himself was courted by Caesaras a fourth member of the group, certainly on the strength of hislegal knowledge and powers of persuasion, but the orator could notbring himself to support in an active way Caesar’s manipulation ofthe constitution. In fact, he spoke out against it. In 59 B.C., Clodius,still bent on revenge, arranged to have himself adopted into a ple-beian family in order to allow him to run for the office of tribune(which was open only to plebeians). Cicero surely saw the hand-writing on the wall, but he seemingly refused to acknowledge it. As16For a detailed account of Clodius’ life and career, see W. J.

Heeven went so far as to refuse a generous offer from Caesar to becomeone of his deputies (legatus) in Gaul or a commissioner for supervis-ing the division of public lands. Clodius secured the office of tribuneand the support of the consuls for 58 B.C., L. Piso and A. Gabinius,in order to avenge himself. Finally in March of 58 B.C., Clodius,who had earlier garnered support from the urban crowd by propos-ing a law that granted them free grain, secured the adoption of abill that outlawed from Rome anyone who had put Roman citizensto death without a trial. The Senate was powerless, and help fromthe consuls and triumvirs (who were angered by Cicero’s rejectionand content to have him removed from the scene for a time) wasnot forthcoming. Cicero decided to leave Rome, retiring into exilein northern Greece. A second law, naming Cicero specifically (andhence unconstitutional) was passed shortly thereafter. Clodius thenengineered the razing of Cicero’s house on the Palatine, managingto have part of it consecrated to Liberty. Other of his propertysuffered damage, and his wife and children were forced to take shel-ter with relatives.It was psychologically devastating for Cicero to deal with the factthat his crushing of the Catilinarian conspiracy, the crowning gloryof his consulship, was, likewise, the cause of his forced departurefrom Rome. The year and a half which he spent in exile was thelow point of his life. Letters from that period to his friend andconfidant Atticus reveal an unseemly yet understandable mood ofdepression that led him even to contemplate suicide. Friends andsupporters, however, were not lacking back in Rome. The consulsand tribunes of 57 B.C. were favorable to Cicero’s cause; Pompey,who had done nothing to throttle Clodius’ previous attacks, nowbecame irritated by his actions and actively supported the recall. On4 August 57 B.C. the law was passed authorizing his return; a monthlater, Cicero arrived in Rome amid an atmosphere of great triumph.Despite the glorious occasion of his return,17the exile was obvi-ously a devastating setback for Cicero, who had invested so muchof his time and energy up to that point to establish a public per-sona invested with dignity, authority, influence, and reputation. Hispersonal dignitaswas seriously diminished, and his consular ethos as17Cicero describes the event in great detail in a letter to Atticus, Ad Atticum4.1.:    11MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 11"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"the imperator togatus, who had saved the state without recourse toarms, was nearly destroyed. Once again, Cicero was forced to scram-ble with all of his energy, this time to re-establish his private andpublic standing, to regain his auctoritasand reconstruct a personabefitting his station in Roman society. His public speeches deliveredduring this time, generally known collectively as post reditum,18are,among other things, calculated to accomplish this goal. They oftenseem to be as much apologies on behalf of Cicero as political delib-erations or defenses of clients. Cicero now adds a new dimension tohis ethos: he presents himself as the consular orator who has nowsaved the state twice without resorting to arms—once through hisefforts to thwart Catiline and his conspiracy, the second time by hisvoluntary withdrawal from Rome to maintain the public peace. Attimes he identifies himself closely with the state; at other times, heportrays himself as the sacrificial victim who was offered, as a kindof devotio, on its behalf.19Events immediately subsequent to his successful recall, includingthe recovery of his building site and damages for the loss of hishouse and estates, as well as a stunning success in his defense ofPublius Sestius, instilled Cicero with an overconfidence in his posi-tion. Encouraged by what he perceived as a growing rift among thetriumvirs, Cicero proposed, in early April of 56, that the Senateshould, the following month, re-open the discussion of Caesar’s dis-tribution of the Campanian land. Once again Cicero had miscalcu-lated the strength and willingness of the senatorial establishment tosupport him in the face of the triumvirs. His action precipitated theso-called conference of Luca, a meeting held in order to patch uptheir differences. Cicero was soon brought to heel: Cicero’s brotherQuintus, in a meeting with Pompey, was reminded of the pledgeshe had given Pompey (about Marcus’ future conduct) previouslywhen he had sued for his brother’s recall; Pompey made it clearthat Marcus’ silence, if not his cooperation, was expected. As a result,Cicero, crestfallen and humiliated, withdrew his motion; in fact, hewas forced (in June or July of 56 B.C.) to present what he calledhis ‘palinode’ or ‘recantation’ (see Ad Att.4. 5) and, for the next sev-eral years, presented no public opposition to the three; in fact, he18See Andrew Riggsby, “The Post ReditumSpeeches,” below, 159–195.19See May (1988): 88–127.12 . MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"was at times enlisted in their service. He was all too aware of theinconsistency of his actions, and he found it embarrassingly exasperat-ing, as he candidly revealed in private correspondence with Atticus.Withdrawal from the public arena, however, did not mean anylack of activity for Cicero. During the half-decade following Luca,he composed three important treatises, De oratore (On the Ideal Orator),De republica(On the Republic), and De legibus(On the Laws). Obviously,returning to the his youthful studies of rhetoric and philosophy pro-vided Cicero both refuge and solace, but more importantly, it sup-plied him with a vehicle by which he could ‘defend and celebratethe ideals of constitutional government in a free republic...It wasthese brilliantly innovative dialogues that established Cicero as thevoice and conscience of the Republic, politically in the wildernessthough he was.’20During this time, however, he did receive anothersignificant honor: nominated by Hortensius, he was elected to theCollege of Augurs in 53 B.C.While Cicero was writing about the ideal state and its laws, theRoman state, during the same time, was in chaos, embroiled inbribery, political maneuverings, disorder, and violence. Elections hadbeen repeatedly postponed because of the unrest, and riots betweenrival gangs, headed by Clodius and Milo, a candidate for office andfriend of Cicero (who had, as tribune, worked for his recall fromexile), were frequent. In January 52 B.C., the companies of Clodiusand Milo met, probably by accident, on the Appian Way; fightingbroke out, and in the scuffle, Clodius was killed. To control the fur-ther unrest that ensued, Pompey was appointed sole consul andenforced strict measures to govern the subsequent proceedings. Cicerodelivered his speech on Milo’s behalf (Pro Milone) in a packed forumunder the eye of Pompey and his armed guard. Visibly shaken bythe circumstances, he completed his speech, but not with his accus-tomed effectiveness. Milo was convicted and went into exile. Thespeech as transmitted to us is an extraordinary rhetorical composi-tion, employing the three modes of persuasion—logical argumenta-tion, portrayal of character (ethos), and appeal to the emotions(pathos)—to near perfection.20T.

He had refused such dutyafter his praetorship and consulship. But in March of 51 B.C., muchto his dismay, he was sent as proconsul to the large province ofCilicia in Asia Minor. Upon his arrival, he found matters, both civiland military, in much disarray. He set about restoring order, fixingreasonable interest rates, and fighting extortion. Faced with the threatof a possible invasion by the Parthians, he shored up his militaryforces and undertook a small campaign against the hill-tribes of Mt.Amanus. After a siege of 46 days, he captured the stronghold, andwas granted a supplicatio(a public thanksgiving) by the Senate. Althoughhe long cherished hopes for a triumph, these were never realized.Cicero returned to Rome in early January of 49 B.C. to find thepolitical situation in turmoil and the state on the brink of civil war.Crassus had been killed in Parthia in 53, and the relationship betweenPompey and Caesar, so often strained in the past, had now reachedthe breaking point. Even after Caesar had crossed the Rubicon,Cicero hoped to be able to negotiate some sort of reconciliationwhich might secure peace. Appointed by the government as districtcommissioner at Capua, he spent the next several weeks away fromthe city, in Campania and at his estate in Formiae, debating withhimself, in true Academic fashion, his best course of action. He real-ized that war, no matter who the victor, would precipitate confiscation,bloodshed, and proscription; he could not stomach the unconstitu-tionality of Caesar’s actions, but was equally repulsed by many deedsof Pompey’s supporters. On 28 March, Caesar himself visited Ciceroat Formiae and requested that he come to Rome to work for peace.The orator frankly set forth conditions which Caesar could not accept,and in the end, Cicero did not go to Rome—a decision of whichhe was justly proud; eventually he joined the republican forces inGreece. After Caesar’s victory at Pharsalus on 9 August 48 B.C.(from which Cicero was absent because of illness), Cato proposedthat command of the army be handed over to Cicero. Cicero refusedand returned to Italy, passing a year fraught with anxiety in Brun-disium. In September of 47, Caesar returned and graciously gaveCicero permission to remain in the country.Cicero generally abstained from politics under the dictatorship ofCaesar, though in 46 B.C., he broke a six-year period of silence bydelivering in the Senate a speech on behalf of Marcellus, soon tobe followed by the other so-called ‘Caesarian Speeches,’ the Pro14 . MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Ligarioand the Pro Rege Deiotaro.21The political hardships that Cicerofaced during this period were compounded seriously by the troubleshe experienced in his own private life. After 30 years of marriage,he divorced his wife Terentia in 46 B.C., the culmination of anestrangement that had begun several year before. He almost imme-diately re-married, but then came the greatest blow: Tullia, hisbeloved daughter, died from complications of childbirth. Cicero’sgrief at the death of his daughter was nearly inconsolable, and hisnew wife Publilia’s lack of sympathetic support led quickly to divorce.Once again, as he had done a decade earlier, he took refuge in phi-losophy and literature. Working day and night because he could notsleep, Cicero’s literary output during the next two years was absolutelyastounding. Writing at a feverish pace, Cicero, as he had done tenyears previously, found not only consolation in his composition, buta way to serve his countrymen and, according to some, present atacit, but powerful critique of autocratic rule.22The Brutus, the Orator,Paradoxa Stoicorum, De finibus bonorum et malorum(On the Supreme Good),the Tusculan Disputations, Academica, and De natura deorum (On the Natureof the Gods), as well as the lost works, the Hortensiusand the Consolatio,are all products of this period.At the assassination of Caesar on the Ides of March, 44 B.C.,‘Brutus, raising high his bloody dagger, called on Cicero by nameand congratulated him on the recovery of freedom,’23rejoicing invictory for what he and his fellow-conspirators believed would be anew lease on life for the Republic. Once again Cicero answered thecall. On March 17, he delivered a speech in the Senate urging ageneral amnesty for the conspirators, like that declared in Athensafter the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants. The arrival in Rome ofthe young C. Octavius, Caesar’s adopted son and heir, further buoyedthe hopes of the republicans. But Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony),who had been Caesar’s colleague in the consulship and had, after theassassination, gained possession of Caesar’s political papers and pri-vate fortune, continued to strengthen his own position. Cicero soonfound himself losing hope, in fear that Rome had merely substitutedone tyrant for another. Again he turned to philosophy, composing21For background and detailed analysis of these speeches, see Harold Gotoff,“Cicero’s Caesarian Orations,” below, 219–271.22Habicht (1990): 74–76.23Philippic 2.28.:    15MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 15"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the De divinatione(On Divination), the De senectute (On Old Age) and theDe amicitia(On Friendship). It was also during this time (44 B.C.) thatCicero began his last, and perhaps most influential philosophical trea-tise, the De officiis(On Moral Duties), written not in dialogue form, butas an expository epistle to his son, discussing the cardinal virtues ofwisdom, justice, fortitude, and temperance, and the notion of utile,the expedient, which cannot ever be rightly divorced from the hon-orable (honestum).Many thoughts about duties, the honorable and the expedientmust have been swirling about in Cicero’s mind, when in July of 44B.C., on his way to Greece and hearing news that a reconciliationbetween Antony and the conspirators was probable, he decided toturn back in order to attend the Senate meeting scheduled for 1September. In Rome, he found the situation less promising than hehad hoped, and decided not to attend the meeting, claiming that hewas ill. Antony, angry at his absence, delivered a speech against him,and made offerings to the deified Caesar. On the next day, 2September 44 B.C., Cicero took the first step on a journey fromwhich there would be no turning back when he answered Antony(who was absent) with the First Philippic, a speech critical of Antony,though free of harsh personal attack. Cicero’s final sentence provedan appropriate valediction for the final year of his life: “For myself,I have lived pretty well long enough, whether in years or in glory.If more is to come, it will come not so much for me as for you andfor the Commonwealth” (translated by Shackleton-Bailey).Antony retired to prepare his reply, which he delivered in theSenate on 19 September 44. Cicero countered with his celebratedSecond Philippic, a scathing invective showing no restraint, which hesent to Atticus for approval in late October. The speech was neverdelivered, but published as pamphlet in late November. It is worthnoting that Cicero himself referred to his speeches against Antonyas ‘Philippics’ (Ad Brut. 2.4), purposely drawing a comparison betweenthese attacks on Antony and those that the great Greek oratorDemosthenes had made on Philip II of Macedon, three hundredyears earlier. From this point on, all of Cicero’s energies were directedtoward rousing the senatorial order in hopes of recapturing the spiritand the glory of the languishing Republic. During the next half year,Cicero delivered twelve more Philippics, two to the people and tento the Senate, all aimed in one way or another at warding offany16 . MAY_f2_1-21 7/11/02 7:14 PM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"sort of reconciliation between the Senate and Antony.24In these ora-tions, Cicero paints Antony as he had his previous adversaries (Verres,Catiline, Clodius, et al.), representing all things un-Roman, eveninhuman, personifying the forces of despotism, madness, evil, anddarkness.25In stark contrast stands the character of Cicero the patriot,true and unfailing, ready and willing to put his life on the line forthe survival of the state—in fact, he is in a way the symbol, eventhe literal embodiment of the Republic. Nearly twenty years afterhis consulship, Cicero finds himself once again leading the Senateand the state in the midst of an internal crisis. Two decades earlier,he had fashioned himself as the imperator togatus(the civilian com-mander), the pacis alumnus(the nursling of peace), who would go toany length—including voluntary exile—to save the state withoutrecourse to arms. Now, on the contrary, he presents himself as theprinceps sumendorum sagorum, ‘the leader in the putting on of militarycloaks,’26rousing the Senate and people to confront Antony in arms,but still relying on the only real weapon he ever knew how to wield—his eloquence.In the end, of course, Cicero had, among other things, seriouslymiscalculated Octavian and his actions. His hopes were ultimatelydashed, yet the effect of his oratory lingered, enough so that its tar-get felt the need to exact vengeance. After the trio of Antony, Lepidus,and Octavian had sealed their compact and were appointed commis-sioners for the reorganization of the state in November (a compactknown to history as the ‘second triumvirate’), they immediately setabout removing their enemies from the scene. Cicero’s name appearedprominently on the list of proscribed (despite, according to Plutarch,the objections of Octavian). At first, Cicero thought of fleeing to theEast, but after a half-hearted attempt to escape, he ordered his slavesto stand aside, and with these words, ‘Let me die in the countrythat I have so often saved’ (Livy 120. 50), he offered his neck toAntony’s minions (7 December 43 B.C.). His head and hands werecarried back to Rome, and, to the horror of the people, nailed tothe Rostra, the place from which he had so often spoken.24For details, see Jon Hall, “The Philippics,” below, 273–304.25Cf.

He appears to have been active in municipalpolitics in Arpinum and it is likely that his contacts with powerfulmen in Rome allowed him to send his son to the capital city foran education.2The speaker’s grandson, on the contrary, is the per-son about whom we know more than any other figure in Romanantiquity: the orator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero. By thestandards of the grandfather, the more famous Cicero, who quotesthis witticism in his treatise On the Orator, was to become one of theworst Romans of the Republican age. This tension between the elderCicero’s alleged disdain for Greek learning and the younger’s unde-niable achievement in making that learning a part of Roman culturemarks not just a progression within the family of the Tullii Cicerones;the decades separating the adulthood of the two men mark a periodduring which Romans were continually confronted with the ques-tion of how to integrate Greek influence into their own culture.It does not really matter for my discussion whether Cicero’s grand-father really did make his remark; nor does it much matter whetherhe would have believed it if he had. Similar forms of anti-Hellenicsentiment occur throughout Roman literature, both before and after theelder Cicero offered his own concise contribution. Most significantly,231De or.2.265: nostros homines similis esse Syrorum venalium: ut quisque optime Graecesciret, ita esse nequissimum.2For Cicero’s grandfather, see Cic. Leg.3.36, with C.

Cicero relates that Crassus, althoughfeigning no more than superficial familiarity with the Greek lan-guage, in fact knew Greek so well that it seemed his native tongue;similarly, Antonius’s pretense of not knowing Greek rhetorical the-ory proves a sham upon closer examination (2.1–5). Cicero’s com-ment when composing the treatise in the 50s B.C.E. makes it clearthat such disingenuous behavior would no longer serve a purpose;moreover, he declines even to conjecture what the original purposecould have been that inspired these denials. Refusing to speculate,he closes discussion with the following enigmatic remark: ‘whatevertheir object may have been, it surely no longer pertains to our owntime.’3The issue of how Greek learning should be used can, byCicero’s adulthood, be dismissed as irrelevant.The progression in On the Orator from the grandfather to Antoniusand Crassus to young Cicero marks a path from disdain to denialto dismissal. This transition renders especially interesting the narra-tive context within which Cicero portrays these attitudes towardGreek learning. In 92 B.C.E., this same Crassus was one of two cen-sors to pass an edict denouncing a group calling themselves the ‘Latinrhetoricians’; the censors, apparently, disapproved of these teachersfor not fully engaging their students in the intricacies of the Greekrhetorical tradition.4The Greek education of Cicero’s Crassus andthe activities of the historical Crassus seem at odds with one another.Furthermore, the dramatic date of the dialogue On the Orator, Septemberof 91 B.C.E., covers a period when the teen-age Cicero is fully im-mersed in learning rhetoric from Greek treatises and teachers anddeclaiming in the Greek language—all with the approval of Crassus.To describe ‘Rhetorical Education in Cicero’s Youth’ entails, it isclear, not simply reconstructing a probable curriculum, but disen-tangling intermingled ideologies.

I shall begin by reviewing what canbe reconstructed concerning Greek contributions to the education ofCicero from his early years in Arpinum until approximately 88 B.C.E.,when Cicero turned eighteen.5I shall then consider how this typeof education is reflected in two rhetorical treatises composed duringroughly the same period: Cicero’s own On Inventionand the anonymoustreatise To Gaius Herennius. Both authors offer first-hand evidence ofhow Roman rhetorical theory was forged from a simultaneously richand disparaged Hellenic tradition.Cicero’s EducationThe single best description of Republican education is Cicero’s accountof his own.6Born at Arpinum in 106 B.C.E., he claims in his laterwritings that the outlying areas of Rome shared a deep respect forlearning during his youth; in fact, a speaker remarks in one of histreatises that the people of Latium have a greater engagement withletters than the residents of Rome itself.7A contemporary of Cicero’sfather from near Arpinum, Quintus Valerius Soranus, receives par-ticular praise for his learning in both Greek and Latin literature.8Itis not unlikely that the wealthy families of Latium saw in educationa means for social advancement. It comes then as little surprise thatCicero’s father was active in promoting the education of his twosons Marcus and Quintus (De or. 2.1).Young Marcus’s education in Arpinum, before he moved to Romeat about the age of ten, can only be inferred from other evidencefor Roman education. He may, like Horace, have attended a local5Because of this terminus, I shall be considering neither Cicero’s oratorical debut(Pro Quinctio) nor his travels and studies in Greece after 88; for these years, see M.

Aculeo receives praise in Cicero’s writings for hisknowledge of civil law and it is known that he trained his own chil-dren and that they were among Cicero’s fellow students.12Beginningin 90 Cicero would further refine his knowledge of civil law by lis-tening as often as permitted to Quintus Mucius Scaevola the auguras he gave legal advice to clients.13Legal knowledge would becomeessential background to his rhetorical training and one which heexploits in his early treatise On Invention. It would be interesting toknow whether the young Cicero’s study of this venerable body oflaw included the tradition that it derived from Greek sources.14Thepresence of a Hellenic kernel in even this revered set of Latin textswould offer an early instance of the hybrid sources he would encounterin his rhetorical training.Cicero’s exposure to Greek philosophy also began in his earlyyears.

As early as 96, when he first arrivedin Rome, his teachers included friends of Crassus, and some of histraining brought him in close contact with this famous orator.19Initially, his principal language of instruction was undoubtedly Greek.The name of only one of his Greek instructors is known with anytype of certainty, the poet Archias, whom Cicero describes as teach-ing him in his earliest youth, presumably in literature.20In respectto his rhetorical studies, Cicero makes clear that the first steps ofinstruction came at the hands of Greek teachers of public speaking.21Indeed, in a move that would have puzzled Cicero’s grandfather andhas caused much scholarly debate, Cicero relates how he was for-bidden in his mid-teens from attending a school that offered theinnovation of teaching rhetoric in the Latin language. He was dis-suaded, he writes, by ‘very learned men...who thought that innatetalent was better nurtured through Greek exercises.’22This notionthat Greek rudiments, combined with innate talent, lay at the basis15Acad.2.115 (a puero); Tusc.5.113; Clarke (1968): 21.

Although perhapsan obvious point, it has not received enough emphasis that Cicerohad already received an extensive introduction to Latin oratory bythe time of this incident in the late nineties. He knew MarcusAntonius’s short treatise on public speaking, composed in Latin andbased on the orator’s own experience in the Forum.23He also atteststo having both studied and memorized Latin orations from previousdecades when only a boy (puer).24In addition, he was a student ofLucius Aelius from Lanuvium, known as ‘Stilo’ on account of hisoccasional occupation as a ghostwriter for Romans facing trial. FromCicero’s own testimony we know that perhaps as early as 92, andcertainly by 90, he was present as a young man (adulescens) at thewriting of a number of Stilo’s speeches.25Aelius, a recognized author-ity in antiquarian matters, also may have introduced him to Romanhistorical studies and etymologizing.26Cicero’s treatise On Invention,composed in the late 90s when he was still in his teens, also revealsextensive familiarity with declamation, a number of instances of whichcover Roman historical situations and were doubtless delivered inLatin.27Beginning in 91, Cicero attended trials in the forum ‘con-stantly’ and listened to magistrates address public assemblies ‘almostdaily.’28Finally, we are led to imagine that Cicero and his fellowpupils spent long hours encouraging experienced Roman orators todiscuss their craft, much as he depicts in his On the Orator(e.g.,1.96–102). Consideration of these Latin studies demonstrates that theobjections that Cicero’s teachers had to the new Latin schools in the90s were not based on the notion that Latin oratory was in itselfsomehow inherently inferior. In fact, as will be clear from my dis-cussion below, the authors of the treatises On Inventionand To Gaius23De or.1.94, 208; Brut.163.24Brut.122, 127, 129, 164.25Brut.207; Kaster (1995): 75–77 discusses the dates.26De or.1.193.27E.g., Inv. 1.11, 17, 72; for Roman declamation in Cicero’s youth, see S.

Between the years of approximately 88 and 86 B.C.E.,after the conclusion of the Social War, Cicero continued to practicedeclamation, principally in Greek. This pursuit reflects his own choice,and the reasons he gives for these studies demonstrate a more matureunderstanding than that of the young man of the late 90s, excitedto follow the latest fashion in Latin teaching. He provides two rea-sons for his decision: first, the Greek language supplies greater oppor-tunity for stylistic ornamentation and second, and more significantly,the best available instructors were Greeks, who did not know Latinwell enough to be able to offer correction and advice in that lan-guage.29The inference to be made from this latter reason is clear:once Greek rhetorical traditions are absorbed into Roman culture,they can be dispensed with. And this is what eventually happened.The beginnings of the process are already present in the first extantofferings to the Roman rhetorical tradition.30De Inventione and Rhetorica ad Herennium:Description of ContentsCicero’s On Inventionand the anonymous treatise To Gaius Herenniusare primarily textbooks for training the reader in public speaking,with a special emphasis on developing oratorical expertise in legalmatters. The two texts are products of the Greek rhetorical tradi-tion, and of particular significance is their debt to the methodologyof Hermagoras of Temnos, a Greek writing in the middle of thesecond century B.C.E. Hermagoras’ rhetorical works, now lost, werecharacterized by the same elaborate systemization of the principlesof rhetoric into various categories and sub-categories that we find inthese two early Latin treatises. In particular, Hermagoras developedin detail the rules governing ‘invention,’ the discovery of ideas or29Brut.310: vel quod Graeca oratio plura ornamenta suppeditans consuetudinem similiterLatine dicendi afferebat vel quod a Graecis summis doctoribus, nisi Graece dicerem, neque corrigipossem neque doceri.30Antonius’s treatise was clearly not as complex as Inv.or Rhet.

Each author complements this frame-work with brief expository prologues that place the practice of rhetoricin a wider cultural and philosophical context, but this context is, aswe shall see in the next section, largely ignored in the main bodyof the text. The discussion instead focuses on the practical tools nec-essary for becoming a persuasive public speaker.The young Cicero ultimately abandoned his plan to treat eachform of the five branches of rhetorical study (a plan implied at Inv.1.9, 2.178). The two books of his surviving work, covering only thefirst part of the five divisions and now appropriately entitled OnInvention, follow a simple scheme. After a prologue on the history ofrhetoric, Cicero briefly treats the stasis theory of Hermagoras (1.10–19)before devoting the bulk of Book One to how one should adoptarguments for each of the six traditional parts of a judicial oration(exordium, narration, partition, confirmation, refutation, peroration).The second book is organized around the three types of speechidentified by the rhetorical tradition: the forensic or judicial (genusiudiciale; 2.14–154), the political or deliberative (genus deliberativum;2.155–176), and the epideictic or show speech (genus demonstrativum;2.177–178). Throughout Book Two the bulk of Cicero’s discussiontreats judicial situations and includes consideration of Hermagoras’classification of ‘issues’ (constitutiones), the different approaches neces-sary in speeches for both defense and prosecution, and the use ofcommonplace arguments.The four books of the anonymous treatise To Gaius Herenniusoffera fuller treatment of the five parts of rhetorical study and give areasonable idea of the book the young Cicero originally set out towrite. The Auctor devotes the first two books and the beginning ofthe third (3.1–15) to a detailed discussion of invention that empha-sizes, as Cicero had, its application to judicial rhetoric.

There then follows the rhetorical tradition’s earliestextant account of the training of memory (3.28–40). The fourth andfinal book is entirely devoted to the oldest treatment of Latin style,a discussion that includes consideration of the three types of oratori-cal style—gravis, mediocris, adtenuata (grand, middle, and simple)—, cor-rect Latinity, and a detailed analysis of the use of figures of speech.From this brief outline of content it is clear that the two treatisesclosely resemble one another in their debt to the Greek rhetoricaltradition. A closer analysis of diction and of the occasional devia-tions each writer makes from his model reveal, however, contrast-ing attitudes about the comfort each writer felt in identifying himselfwith that tradition.De Inventione and Rhetorica ad Herennium:Relationship and ChronologyIn 1910 Eduard Norden ranked the relationship between On Inventionand the treatise To Gaius Herennius‘among the most interesting prob-lems of Roman literary history as yet not perfectly resolved.’31Althoughchanging scholarly fashion would likely not agree with Norden’sassessment regarding the problem’s inherent interest, it remains truethat scholars have not reached agreement nearly a century later con-cerning the two treatises’ historical and pedagogical context, Greekpredecessors, or chronological relationship. I will provide a brief sum-mary of what can be said with approximate certainty concerning theorigins of these two works by way of introduction to my primaryconcern: how their respective uses of Greek models, and their acknowl-edgments of such debts (or lack thereof ), reflect the ways in whichRoman educational principles developed in relationship to Greekmodels from the 90s to the 80s B.C.E.Although the two treatisespresent myriad problems of interpretation, their deviations from oneanother—the source of most of these problems—can be used to31In A.

Indeed it is quite possible that bothworks were never intended for the general public and that thereforethis mutual ignorance is innocent: Cicero states in On the Oratorthathis early work ‘slipped out of my notebooks,’ and the preface of theAuctor has been taken to imply that his treatise was meant only forthe personal use of the addressee.32The likelihood that the authorsdid not know each other’s work makes especially compelling the factthat there are numerous verbal correspondences between the twotexts, including more than forty places where entire sentences appearverbatim.33Equally interesting, and compounding the difficulty ofdetermining the precise relationship between the two texts, are thoseplaces where, despite their sameness, the two accounts deviate fromone another: the Latin technical vocabulary employed, while usuallycommon, does differ on occasion; their accounts of stasistheory dis-agree; in many places verbatim accounts are truncated or supple-mented in one or the other text, with no consistency regarding whichoffers the fuller version.34Finally, and most clearly, the prefaces andepilogues appended to each work express very different views of theauthors’ intentions in writing and of their relation to their sources.Equally contested are the dates of composition, although herescholars seem to be moving towards a greater consensus than in thepast. The latest datable event mentioned in On Invention falls in theconsulship of Crassus in 95 B.C.E. (2.111); it is also likely that Ciceroalludes to a famous political trial from approximately 93 B.C.E. (2.62,122; see too Brut.194–198).

Since the work contains no reference to the SocialWar and Cicero does not include a reference to Crassus in his listof great orators (meaning, therefore, that Crassus is presumably aliveat the time of composition), it is generally accepted that the workwas completed around 91 B.C.E.,the year the war began and Crassusdied.36The composition of the treatise To Gaius Herenniusis usuallyplaced in the following decade, a date that probably should beretained despite recent efforts to put it later. Since the identity ofthe author is unknown, it is not possible to use external evidence todetermine the date.37Internal references, however, indicate that theAuctor was certainly writing the fourth book after 86 B.C.E., sincereference is made to the consulship of Marius in that year (4.68). Inaddition, the fact that the author does not mention conditions underSulla would indicate, but unfortunately cannot guarantee, that theentire work was finished before 82.38If we assume that the relative chronology of the two works is asoutlined—On Invention was written first, followed by To Gaius Herenniusin the next decade—, it then becomes necessary to explain the sim-ilarities and divergences between them.

This option offers three basic possibilities: 1) both worksrely on a common Latin treatise; 2) both works use prior treatiseswritten in both Greek and Latin; 3) each author relies principallyon oral Latin sources, a hypothesis that includes the possibility thatboth authors shared a teacher.40Although cogent arguments can andhave been made for all three possibilities, the third seems most likelywhen one considers that no Latin treatise of any complexity is knownto have existed prior to the 90s and that the hypothesis that bothauthors are working primarily from lecture notes—as indeed Ciceroimplies he did with his remark that On Invention came from his ‘note-books’ (commentariola; De or.1.5) and as could be inferred from theone mention by the Auctor of his teacher (noster doctor: 1.18)—explainsbetter the verbal similarities than the use of solely written sourcematerial. The divergences can then be explained by the fact thateach author listened to the same teacher at different times in hiscareer, when his ideas had undergone revision through time.41The Greek Background: Acknowledgment and Mis-recognitionThe two earliest extant rhetorical treatises in Latin were written with-out awareness of each other and the majority of their contents likelyderives from the teachings of a single individual.

For despite their many similarities, the Auctorand the young Cicero profess different attitudes toward their Greekbackground. And if we accept that Cicero’s composition precedesTo Gaius Herenniusby about a decade, it is possible to detect in thetransition between the two works a small stage in the larger progres-sion from the anti-Hellenism of Cicero’s grandfather to the RomanizedGreekness that came to characterize his grandson’s later work. I shallnot, however, focus on the debt these treatises owe to a mostly lostGreek inheritance, a debt that varies in accordance with unprovableassumptions regarding each author’s originality. Rather, I will con-sider what evidence the works offer concerning the criteria of selec-tion (and rejection) from this inheritance, and place these criteria inthe pedagogical and cultural context of the early first century.42Marx characterized On Invention as a treatise palliata, in contrastwith the togatatreatise of the Auctor.43The comparison with the twoforms of early Roman drama is apt, for just as each type of com-edy relies heavily on the Greek dramatic tradition but in turn eitheradmits to that influence by having characters appear on stage dressedas Greeks (in the case of the palliata) or camouflages it in ‘Romandress’ (togata), so too does Cicero not attempt to disguise his use ofGreek theorists while the Auctor, on the contrary, asserts his inde-pendence. Even the most superficial reading makes this contrast clear:the text of To Gaius Herenniusmentions not a single Greek writer byname, whereas the young Cicero openly acknowledges his eclecti-cism in choosing Greek sources (2.4) and names several Greek authors.Scholars have succeeded in demonstrating that the Auctor is over-exuberant, if not outright dishonest, in his claims of independence.This is especially evident in Book Four, where he exaggeratedlyclaims to have used his own examples to illustrate aspects of rhetor-ical style.44I shall offer one particularly clear case in which theAuctor uses Greek sources without complete consideration of theimplications. On a few occasions his text implies that the speakerusing his advice will be speaking in his own defense; this appears to42For this approach, see A. E.

Yet it is not possible to discuss with certainty the philosophicalinfluence that any specific Greek thinkers may have had on theauthors. The Auctor does not mention by name philosophers orschools in his treatise and, although Cicero’s text owes an indis-putable debt to the Hellenic tradition, especially the works ofHermagoras of Temnos and Aristotle’s Rhetoric, it is unlikely that hewas aware of either author first-hand.46Specifics, however, are unnec-essary. An analysis of each author’s application of philosophy, evenat a general level, to the study of oratory and rhetorical theoryreveals significantly different attitudes toward how Roman cultureshould accommodate Greek learning.The first book of On Inventionopens with a prologue debating thenature of rhetoric: does eloquence help more than harm? The debateoccurs throughout the rhetorical tradition, but the young Ciceromakes a clear effort to apply the controversy to the case of Rome.Although historically, he writes, the invention of speech is the greatcivilizer (1.1–3), at the same time the misapplication of this new dis-covery, which results in ‘eloquence without wisdom’ (eloquentia sinesapientia), has produced wars and political discontent. Cicero’s ensu-ing discussion makes clear that the wisdom he has in mind consistsprimarily of moral study. The origins of this eloquence without wis-dom, that is without a moral component, are then traced back toa time when states were led by only the most honest men. Such aseemingly desirable situation created a gap whereby the settlementof private legal disputes fell into the hands of other, less honorablemembers of society. These individuals, our earliest legal advocates,came to learn how to shape eloquence through deceit in order towin their suits. Cicero continues: the members of this group, wish-45E.g. Rhet.

Cicero’s account reveals an idealized notion of thenature of political rhetoric. For society to succeed, moral consider-ations must coexist with political considerations. The seeminglyinevitable decline forecast by this fanciful reconstruction has notoccurred in Cicero’s contemporary Rome—yet. The Republic hasavoided any corrupting tendencies through the intervention of greatfigures such as Cato, Laelius, Africanus, and the Gracchi. These menhave continually combined eloquence with wisdom, political author-ity with moral virtue (summa virtute amplificata auctoritas; 1.5).Cicero then considers how this crisis of division between moraland political authority can be resolved on a permanent basis throughproper instruction in rhetoric. Although the question reflects a debatealready long ongoing, the young Cicero chooses his side clearly.47After deciding that it is inappropriate for the orator to consider inhis training ‘general questions’ (quaestiones) such as ‘Are the senses tobe trusted?’ or ‘Is honor the only good?,’ Cicero concludes:It seems utter madness to entrust to the orator as if they were trivialmatters the kinds of subjects that we know have occupied the supremetalents of philosophers and involved the greatest labor.48Despite this passionate outburst, Cicero offers no concrete sugges-tions for resolving the division between philosophy and rhetoric. Laterin the first book, however, by citing specific instances of how phi-losophy can enhance rhetoric, Cicero makes clear that he believesthe rhetorician should adopt an eclectic approach to philosophicalsources. In discussing the partition of arguments (partitio), for exam-ple, he reveals his awareness that philosophers employ forms of par-tition not traditionally used by the rhetorician. Cicero has, accordingly,taken the initiative in borrowing some of these if he deemed themsuitable for oratorical practice.49He continues to acknowledge these47It is irrelevant to my argument whether Cicero misrepresents his sources; seeH.

At the sametime, however, he reiterates his earlier advice on avoiding philo-sophical obscurities: philosophers have, he notes, discovered otherforms of deduction, but he will not consider them since they areremoved from the orator’s task.50Cicero presents his views as apply-ing directly to the practical needs of the Roman orator. Again, Iam not concerned with the difficult question of the extent to whichCicero’s claims derive from Greek sources. What is important is thathe sees his system, whether entirely original or not, as a consciousadaptation to a specific cultural and political situation.Aside from these two passages from later in Book One, the remain-der of Cicero’s treatise shows much less concern with situating Romein the debate concerning the relevance of philosophy to rhetoric. Inthis respect, the treatise frequently betrays its origin as an unworkedversion of a Greek treatise (a characteristic it shares, as we shall see,with To Gaius Herennius). A particularly remarkable oversight in revis-ing occurs when Cicero includes among the attributes of a personwhether his nationality is ‘Greek or barbarian’ (1.35: Graius an bar-barus). The intended Roman audience has temporarily disappeared.Despite slips of this sort, however, other passages show Cicero con-tinuing to adapt his material for a Roman readership. Particularlyinteresting is his account of how a speaker should treat a propername in order to create in a jury suspicion about an opponent’smoral rectitude (2.28–29). Although manipulation of proper namesconstitutes a traditional subcategory of the treatment of personalattributes (eae res quae personis attributae sunt), Cicero observes howRoman practice in this area fools ‘inexperienced Greeks’ (Graecisimperitis). The issue under consideration involves the unique and pecu-liar phenomenon at Rome of the pejorative name; Cicero cites inparticular ‘Caldus,’ ‘Clodius,’ ‘Caecilius,’ and ‘Mutius,’ names thatsuggest, respectively, a harsh temper, lameness, blindness, and mute-ness. Virtually unknown to the Greeks, the existence of pejorativenaming practices offers a way for the orator to ground an opponentin the world by means of his ‘fixed and proper appellation’ (certo etproprio vocabulo). Roman names offer access to personal morality, aslabels to a bearer’s content, in a way that is impossible in Greek50Inv.1.77: illa nobis abhorrere ab usu oratoris visa sunt.38 MAY_f3_22-48 7/11/02 7:15 PM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"culture, consisting as it does largely of praiseworthy names such as‘Demosthenes’ (‘the people’s strength’) or ‘Aristophanes’ (‘the bestspeaker’).51Exploiting this onomastic peculiarity opens for the Romanorator a new claim to moral authority. He acts as teacher, assert-ing his authority not through words, but through proper observa-tion of how labels operate.The second passage in which the young Cicero’s text veers fromHellenic tradition involves the definition of how to derive an author-itative judgment. In his discussion of proofs that may be offered byan orator on the basis of probability, he includes as a subcategorythose proofs that are based on the judgment (iudicatum) rendered bya specific person or persons (1.48) He further subdivides the iudica-tuminto three types: those based on religious considerations, on com-mon social practice, and on special approval (religiosum, commune,approbatum). It is in this final class of ‘special approval’ (approbatum)that Cicero’s text offers a significant variation from Greek precedent.In the Greek rhetorical tradition, the iudicatum approbatumrested onthe authority of the philosopher.52This role of the philosopher hasbeen banished from the Roman On Invention:Special approval (approbatum) occurs when people have made a deci-sion on their own authority (sua...auctoritate) whenever there arisesdoubt over how something should be treated. The Roman people didthis in respect to the acts of the elder Gracchus when it made himconsul after his censorship on the grounds that he did nothing whilecensor without his colleague’s knowledge.53The text alludes to a legal action at the close of 169 B.C.E., in whichTiberius Sempronius Gracchus refused to be tried separately fromhis colleague in the censorship. As a result of his perceived integrityin the affair, Cicero claims, Gracchus was later elected to the con-sulship. Cicero has placed an historical incident into a rhetorical cat-egory. The authority at Rome for decision rests not on the philosopher,51A.

To reiteratein the terms we have adopted: for oratory to succeed in maintain-ing order, moral authority must remain the possession of politicalauthority. As with Cato, Laelius, Africanus, and the Gracchi in thepreface to Book One, the feature that gives force to the judgmentof the Roman people is auctoritas.Despite their directness, these two moments in which Roman real-ity peers through a Greek framework are rare in On Invention, wherethe overall impression is of a treatise still struggling with how to finda place for philosophy in rhetorical theory. It is the tract To GaiusHerenniusthat will take the next step. Although the texts have remark-able correspondences, the Auctor strives to hide the debt to theGreek past that Cicero openly acknowledges. The best way to beginto discover the reasons underlying this change is by comparing theauthors’ direct methodological statements as found in the prologuesto the second book of On Inventionand to the first of To Gaius Herennius.On Invention Book Two begins with a defense of Cicero’s eclecticmethod through a famous comparison with the painter Zeuxis.54Zeuxis had been invited by the citizens of Croton to paint a pic-ture of Helen of Troy. As his model for Helen the painter com-bined the choicest features of the five most beautiful women in thecity ‘because nature has forged in a single form nothing that is per-fect in every part.’55Similarly, Cicero claims that throughout histreatise he will choose from his sources those points that best servethe purpose at hand. The doctrine provides a striking contrast withthat professed in To Gaius Herennius. Although a similar eclecticismclearly underlies his treatise, the Auctor firmly and explicitly deniesthe influence of Greek philosophical precedents. Simultaneous withthis denial, however, emerges an odd ambivalence. Adopting a stancesimilar to the interlocutors in Cicero’s late philosophical treatises—and to the mature Cicero himself—, the Auctor does identify a placefor philosophy: he associates its study with retreat (otium), when he54K. Barwick, Das rednerische Bildungsideal Ciceros.Abhandlungen der SächsischenAkademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig, philologisch-historische Klasse, 54.3 (Berlin:Akademie-Verlag 1963): 20–25, argues that this prologue (Inv. 2.1–10) derives fromIsocrates through an intermediate source.55Inv.2.3: quod nihil simplici in genere omnibus ex partibus perfectum natura expolivit.40 MAY_f3_22-48 7/11/02 7:15 PM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"is not impeded by either public or personal business.56Immediatelyafter identifying this realm of scholarly otium he contrasts the pur-suit of philosophy with the task that lies before him, the composi-tion for Gaius Herennius of a work on the art of rhetoric. In adoptingthis task, he claims he will follow a course separate from Greekauthors, whose prolixity on the subject he attributes to ‘empty arro-gance’ (1.1: inanis adrogantiae causa). That is, unlike Cicero in OnInvention, who recognized that philosophy could contribute in vary-ing degrees to the success of an orator, the Auctor locates the valueof philosophy completely outside the realm of public, political dis-course. Philosophical thinking accompanies the leisure time that isavailable when the statesman has finished with public affairs. Perhapsthe Auctor, like Cato, sees Greek philosophy as a cultural posses-sion along the lines of fancy clothing or silver, possessions to be usedin private; parading them publicly risks overpowering the politicallydominant culture that has acquired these luxury items.57And yet hisattack is necessary for the time during which he writes. He cannotignore Greek writers since Hellenic contributions have already begunto become a significant part of every aspect and stage of Romaneducation—as we have seen clearly in the case of Cicero’s own edu-cation.58The dismissive attitude he adopts has tempted some schol-ars to see the influence of the Latin rhetors of the 90s B.C.E. onthe Auctor, but it is neither necessary nor productive to approachthis controversial issue.59Instead, I will contrast the ways in whichthe Auctor integrates Greek background into his treatise with Cicero’stechnique in On Invention.56Rhet.

Scholars have considered this lack of acknowledgment,this studied mis-recognition, as, at best, disingenuous. I would liketo argue instead that, compared with Cicero, the Auctor considersthe acknowledgment of Greek culture as a greater threat to the con-vergence of moral and political authority at Rome.The treatise takes up where On Invention left offin its attempts toassert that moral authority belongs at Rome not with the philosopher,but with the populus(Inv. 1.48). The Auctor supports the identificationof moral authority with political authority most clearly in Book Four,where he famously opts for the use of his own exemplain teachinghis pupils the elements of style (elocutio). After rehearsing some of themany reasons the Greeks have offered for drawing examples of styleonly from established authorities, the Auctor concludes:When [the Greeks] make these claims, they stir us more by theirauthority (auctoritate sua) than by the truth of their argument.60The issue of authority (auctoritas) and its misapplication to rhetoricalstudies emerges just as it had in On Invention, when the author mustchoose between the seductive intricacies of Greek thought and thepracticality of Roman training. And as the remainder of the Auctor’sreasoning clarifies, his aims are thoroughly pragmatic: these Greektheorists have no practical experience (they would not dare enter the‘race course of rhetoric;’ 4.4); to provide many examples from manysources misleads the pupil into believing that one person cannot mas-ter all the elements of style (4.9); his own method allows the Auctorto model each example according to the didactic goal intended ineach particular case (4.10).The majority of the exemplaemployed by the Auctor treats sub-jects from Roman society and history.

Politically charged terms such asgravitasand dignitassurface in the text as ways of characterizing style,thereby reinforcing the interconnectedness of political and rhetoricalgoals.62In a similar way, the claim that his sententiaeembody origi-nal formulations allows the Auctor to stress social propriety and theimportance of action.63As he himself says, he approves of the frame-work upon which rhetoric is built, but it is the content fleshing outthe framework that he feels he must supply through his treatise—‘although I have praised the Greeks for discovering the art, I havenot followed their treatment of examples.’64This clear statement, inits simultaneous acknowledgment of debt and claim for innovation,resonates with the practice of many Roman artists—playwrights,painters, lyric and epic poets.Teaching by exemplarepresents the imposition of Roman traditionon Greek background.

Although weknow precious little about the details of the tirocinium, it is clear thatit constituted a stage in training consisting of observation and imi-tation as opposed to critical reflection, of learning by precept ratherthan by logic. The younger Pliny, although describing an institutionwith little meaning in his own time, lists the functions of the tirociniumas follows:The entire business of being a senator used to be taught through exam-ples—the surest form of teaching; [youths] learned what rights theypossessed in proposing laws and in expressing their opinions; whatpower exists for magistrates and what freedom for everyone else; whento yield and when to stand firm; when it is proper to speak or besilent; how to differentiate among competing motions and how to addan amendment to a prior suggestion.67The tirociniumpermitted the young Roman elite to observe first-handthe exercise of political authority, in contexts in which moral con-siderations were represented as part of the decision-making process.68This training provided the necessary supplement to the hybrid ofGreek and Roman pedagogical practice preceding the tirocinium, aswe saw typified in Cicero’s earliest education.The Roman reliance on practical experience in education, praisedin the quotation from Pliny, also receives stress in a passage sharedby both rhetorical treatises. This passage undoubtedly constitutedpart of the tradition that taught the two authors. The dichotomydrawn is a simple one: it is insufficient simply to ‘talk about the art’of speaking (de arte loqui), as Greek theorists do; it is far more impor-tant ‘to speak in accordance with the art’ (ex arte dicere).69It has beenargued that this differentiation of theory from practice originates notin a Roman but in an unknown, late Hellenistic, Greek source.70this section are inspired by David’s Chapter 7 (“Les enjeux de l’éducation oratoire:l’éloquence et l’autorité”).67Plin.

The Roman orator valorizes forensic practice overGreek speculation. The source for the two treatises has absorbed thetradition and chosen those elements of rhetorical theory best suitedfor Roman society. Having been incorporated into the later rhetoricaltradition, the elements, whatever their ultimate source, become Roman.When Cicero in On Invention denied the relevance of the moreabstract forms of deductive reasoning to the task of the orator (1.77),he was making the initial, tentative steps toward rejecting Greekphilosophical principles. The Auctor addresses the issue more gen-erally in the preface to his work, in which he opposes himself toGreek theorists by insisting that he will not include extraneous remarksin the manner of the Greeks. They digress, he tells us, out of fear‘that they may give the impression of being insufficiently knowledge-able.’71A further step in the process of differentiation is the Auctor’schoice to adopt primarily historical models in opposition to the liter-ary examples of the Greeks. This continuing Romanization of Greekmodels finds parallels in oratorical practice. One of Cicero’s earliestrecorded speeches, On Behalf of Sextus Roscius, was delivered in 80B.C.E., a few years after the composition of To Gaius Herennius. Astudy of Cicero’s techniques of persuasion in this speech concludesthat ‘technical items have been made subservient to the orator’s artof swaying the feelings of his audience. Not only is there nothing inOn Inventionthat would suggest such a course, but it is altogetherunlikely that Hellenistic rhetoricians would have advocated it.’72Thistendency observed in On Behalf of Sextus Rosciuscharacterizes Romanoratory in general, which tends to rely more than its Greek counter-part on the moral and emotional as factors in persuasion.73If theseCiceros und zum vierten Buch des Auctor ad Herennium,” Philologus105 (1961):307–314, esp. 312–314.71Rhet.

The tirociniumsupplements the rhetorical tradition, instillingmoral considerations to create the new hybrid of Roman oratory.ConclusionTwenty-five years after his speech for Sextus Roscius, Cicero com-posed On the Orator, a dialogue that takes place, as we have seen, in91 B.C.E., a date not long before young Cicero and the Auctor ven-ture on their own treatises. In this dialogue, the recognition thatphilosophical training and political authority must learn to coincidefinds its fullest expression in the mature Cicero’s representation ofCrassus. Crassus claims to have neither the desire nor sufficient expe-rience to teach rhetorical treatises (1.99). His excuse for ignorancecontains an ironic aside that recalls our treatises’ distinction betweenwriting ‘about the art’ (de arte) and practicing ‘in accordance withthe art’ (ex arte); he pleads ‘an unfamiliarity with these matters thatare passed down as if they constituted some kind of art.’74Besideshaving a misguided preoccupation with ars, he continues, these writ-ers are insufficient in doctrine; a fuller wisdom is needed, a unionof philosophy and practice (3.70–73). Once that state has been real-ized, the result is the paradox toward which the Auctor and youngCicero have been fumbling: the Roman Greekling who is superiorto the Greeks. Crassus continues:Both our language and the nature of affairs permit the venerable knowl-edge of the Greeks to be transferred to our own habitual use. Thereis, however, a need for educated men, who until now have not existedamong us, at least not in this particular area. But if they ever shouldemerge, they will have to be considered superior even to the Greeks.75In the context of this remark, Cicero’s implication that On the Oratorreplaced On Inventionmakes sense.76The writing of On the Oratorrep-74De or. 1.99: earum rerum, quae quasi in arte traduntur, inscitia.75De or.3.95: patitur enim et lingua nostra et natura rerum veterem illam excellentem-que prudentiam Graecorum ad nostrum usum moremque transferri, sed hominibus opus est erudi-tis, qui adhuc in hoc quidem genere nostri nulli fuerunt; sin quando exstiterint, etiam Graeciserunt anteponendi.76Kennedy (1972): 107–108, 137–138.46 MAY_f3_22-48 7/11/02 7:15 PM Page 46"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"resents the final stop in the continuous effort to integrate Greek tra-dition with Roman civic authority.

MayAnd I indeed believe that the orator should master everything that isrelevant to the practices of citizens and the ways humans behave: allthat is connected with normal life, the functioning of the State, oursocial order, as well as the way people usually think, human natureand character. (De oratore2.68)Oratory, because it deals by its very nature with relationships betweenindividuals or individuals and their community, is perhaps the mostculturally specific of all literary genres. Indeed, the usual goal of anyspeaker who addresses a jury or an assembly of peers is persuasion;and persuasion is generally achieved only when an orator can relateclosely to the customs, tastes, fears, and desires of his audience. Itis not surprising, therefore, to find Cicero demanding often (as hedoes in the guise of M. Antonius in the above quotation) that ora-tors become intimately familiar with their own social and politicalmilieu, and that they adapt their speeches accordingly in order tobe closely in touch with the tastes of their community and its com-mon modes of thought and expression.1If Cicero considered it important to urge his fellow orators repeat-edly to keep in mind ambient cultural circumstances when compos-ing their speeches, how much more should the modern reader,removed more than two millennia from the situation of any givenoration, attempt to pay heed to the cultural context of ancient ora-tory? After all, when we open a text of Cicero’s speeches,2we are,in a certain way, entering a new culture, one that is far removed491Cf., e.g., De oratore1.224–230; 2.131, 159, 306, 337; 3.39, 49, 66.2Mention should perhaps be made at the outset of the long-standing debate overthe relationship between the speeches that Cicero actually delivered in court andthose that he eventually published (Cf. e.g., J.

Riggsby, Crime and Community in CiceronianRome [Austin: University of Texas Press 1999]: 178–184; see also Quintilian12.10.49–57). We know, for example, of some Ciceronian speeches that were pub-lished as virtual verbatim transcripts of the delivered version (e.g., Pro Cornelio), whileothers (e.g., Pro Milone) had undergone considerable revision. It is, of course, tempt-ing to speculate whether and to what degree Cicero may have altered the pub-lished versions of his speeches. In most cases, the evidence is entirely inconclusive.What we have, obviously, are the speeches as transmitted to us, and it is safe toassume that Cicero himself published these as effective examples of persuasion, suit-able for presentation to a Roman jury, the Senate, or the people. It is on thesegrounds that they must be judged. Riggsby’s summary (1999: 184) expresses, per-haps, the most salutary approach to the problem: ‘The direct evidence for rela-tionship between the delivered and published versions of Cicero’s speeches is weak.What there is suggests that most of the changes consist of small-scale stylistic pol-ishing and occasional brief additions. There is little or no evidence for changes inthe substance of any of Cicero’s arguments. Stylistic details of the published speechesare characteristic of oral discourse; the simplest explanation for this is that theyderive directly from the original. A study of Cicero’s implicit and explicit motivia-tions for promulgating his speeches (advertising, information, and education) showsthat it would have been to his advantage to reproduce fairly closely the texts ofthe speeches as he delivered them in court.’ For further discussion of Cicero’s rea-sons for publishing (or not publishing) his speeches, see Jane W. Crawford, “TheLost and Fragmentary Orations,” below, 305–330; also E.

And just as those who travel in aforeign country sometimes find it difficult, despite every good inten-tion, to suspend their judgment and refrain from invidious compar-isons, so often do those who approach ancient oratory initially findit difficult to refrain from judging the speeches of Cicero accordingto contemporary notions and standards of persuasion. When theyencounter a speech wherein the orator spends much of his time talk-ing about his own accomplishments, or praising the sterling charac-ter of his client, or savagely attacking the character of his opponent,or indulging in theatrical displays of emotion, while all the timeseeming to neglect the so-called ‘real’ issues of the case, they find ithard to believe that he could have really spoken in such a fashion,or that a jury or the Senate could have actually been persuaded bysuch an approach.MAY_f4_49-70 7/11/02 7:16 PM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The remarkable thing, of course, is that we know that Cicero wasextremely successful in persuading his audiences,3a fact which shouldgive us pause to second-guess the orator’s tactics or to call into ques-tion elements in his speeches that appear unsuitable or foreign toour own notions of effective methods of persuasion. Perhaps a morefruitful approach would be to embrace those elements of Ciceronianoratory and recognize them as very possibly being the elements thatallowed him, within the cultural and political setting of first-centuryB.C. Rome, to be such a successful public speaker. Cicero certainlypracticed what he preached: he was an orator who was acutely awareof his audience and its traditions. Indeed, the history of Ciceronianoratory is essentially the account of the artistic ways and means bywhich Cicero met the actual rhetorical challenges placed on him byeach of his cases and by the idiosyncrasies of the Roman social,political, and judicial systems. In the pages that follow, I will attempt,in a necessarily brief and superficial manner, to set the context withinwhich an orator like Cicero operated,4in hopes of providing a kindof orientation for those who are new to, or not entirely familiar with,the kinds of rhetorical situations that Cicero faced as a public speaker,and the strategies that he commonly employed in them.Ciceronian oratory is a product of the meeting of some featuresof Greek and earlier Roman oratory, of Roman traditions, and ofCicero’s own native gifts, education, and originality. By the time ofCicero’s youth, highly developed rhetorical systems, codified centuriesearlier by the Greeks into handbooks for instruction, had become astaple in the education of budding Roman orators.5Cicero’s ownyouthful treatise, De inventione, provides a graphic example of whatcould be expected of this handbook tradition.6Though obviously3Cf.

Much, much more isrequired of a good orator in Cicero’s eyes, a point that he reiter-ates time and time again in his mature rhetorical works, and illus-trates vividly in practice in his speeches before the courts.8In thisconnection, it is absolutely necessary to keep in mind (and impera-tive for students of ancient oratory to understand from the outset)that pleaders in a Roman court of law were not ‘lawyers’ in themodern sense of the word. Most speakers who appeared in courthad little if any expertise in the law itself, a condition which Cicerolaments with considerable regret.9Handbooks of rhetoric containedno instruction in the law. Cicero had studied the civil law in greatdetail under the mentorship of the great jurists of his day, theScaevolas; he was the exception—most pleaders in Cicero’s Rome,not conversant with legal complexities, had recourse to the servicesof jurists when their cases demanded it.Rhetorical handbooks in the Greek tradition also could not helpbut fail to account for particular judicial circumstances that werepeculiarly relevant to Rome. The most important and signficant ofthese circumstances was closely connected to the traditional client-patron relationship that characterized most social relationships inCicero’s time: an influential patron could offer a client protection orhelp of various kinds; in turn, the client might call on his patron athome, escort him in the forum, support his canvass for public office,and vote for him in an election.

In Rome, on the contrary, it was cus-tomary for the plaintiffor defendant to enlist one or several advo-cates (patroni) to plead his case. Obviously, the ramifications of sucha ‘rhetoric of advocacy’ are manifold,10particularly in regard to thescope of presentation of character, for in this situation not only thelitigants’ character comes into play, but that of their patronias well.This means, of course, that it is important, sometimes even crucial,for the speaker to possess a goodly measure of auctoritas, a reputationand standing in the community that will carry weight with the jurors.His character now takes center stage along with that of his client;under such circumstances, it is not surprising to find a speaker, espe-cially a consular orator like Cicero who had attained high rank andaccomplished much on behalf of his fellow citizens, making refer-ence to his own character, his own accomplishments, his own stand-ing in the State. Indeed, on some occasions, it appears that theperson of Cicero is more in prominence in the speech than is hisclient or his case. By identifying his client with himself and his deeds,the orator invests his client with a measure of that authority andprestige, elements that could very well swing the jury’s verdict in hisdirection.11When dealing with the oratory of an ancient culture, we mustcontinually keep in mind a point that, while obvious, is increasinglydifficult—as we enter upon the 21st century—to remember andappreciate: Cicero’s Rome was still largely an oral society. To besure, large numbers of Romans in Cicero’s day were literate, andCicero’s senatorial peers were obviously highly literate. But withoutprinting press, daily newspapers, radio, television, not to mentionemail and internet, Roman society remained extremely dependenton the spoken word. Under such circumstances, we can readily under-stand the importance of public speaking and of public listening, andwe can better appreciate the power that a persuasive speaker mighthold at his command.

When working in the context of an ancient, largelyoral civilization, these differences are perhaps even more striking.The ancients, by necessity, viewed the world and the things in itmuch differently from the ways we do. Their conception of time,their dependence on oral and aural communication, their notions ofmodes of persuasion, the expectations imposed by their traditions,not even to mention the manifold problems posed by working witha scroll rather than a book, must have had profound effects on com-positional techniques. It should not, therefore, shock or disturb usto find elements in Ciceronian speeches that might merit criticismin other contexts: the speeches are replete with digressions, lengthydisquisitions, and multiple or circular treatments of the same or sim-ilar points that can grate on the sensibilities of a modern, readingaudience. Viewed within the context of the oral society of Cicero’sRome, however, these apparent ‘faults’ in composition can actuallyprove to be what accounts for a speech’s effectiveness. Digressionstend to relieve the tension of the argument but at the same timerender it support from another, unexpected direction.13Repetitions,far from being mere redundancies, bring the reader back to keyissues at key points in the course of the argument; they often lookboth forwards and backwards; they combine with verbal repetitionsto form motifs that tend to resonate in the reader’s or listener’s mind.Like the motifs in a work of music—another artistic medium that isintended for auralconsumption—, these recur and recall the listener’sthoughts to the major themes in the speech, thereby providing akind of girdered structure upon which the composition rests.12Cf.

In an article on Book1 of De oratore, Leeman likens the treatise to the symphonies ofBruckner:For a long time, the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, too, were admiredfor their manifold beauties, but at the same time criticized for theirlength, their repetitions and their circular movements. Accordingly,these ‘Riesenschlangen’ (Brahms), or series of ‘miscarriages’ (Sir ThomasBeecham), were curtailed for performance. Only during the last decadesa true appreciation of their ‘Urfassung’ has spread as a consequenceof a better insight in and feeling for their inner structure. A similarapproach does not seem out of place in the case of the De oratore.Wemight say that here, too, we have to analyse its themes and their vari-ations, their correlations and oppositions, and even its ‘orchestration’in the conversation between the dramatis personae.14Similar claims can be made for Cicero’s compositional techniquesas illustrated in his orations.If it is important for us to remember the oral nature of Cicero’sRome, it is equally important for us to recognize the environmentin which most communication, at least communication that in anyway affected the larger community, took place. In De oratore(3.23;cf. Brutus290), Cicero identifies three major audiences for the ora-tor: the Senate, the iudices or jury members, i.e., the court, and thepopulus, i.e., the people in assembly, usually addressed in a contio, orpublic meeting. The venue for nearly all of this activity was theRoman Forum. The Senate generally met in the Curia (the Senatehouse)—located on the north side of the forum—in private sessionbut with doors open. At the will of the presiding magistrate or onspecial occasions, it might assemble at another public, consecratedsite in the city, often a temple.15A good majority of the public speak-ing that took place in other contexts would have been done in theopen air, where a crowd of people (sometimes well in excess of those14“The Structure of Cicero’s De OratoreI,” in Ciceroniana: Hommages à K.

The Roman ‘courtroom’ was, in fact,usually not a ‘room’ at all, but a designated space in the forumunder the sun and open sky. In Cicero’s day, there were severalstanding courts, presided over generally by the praetors, who, withtheir attendants and scribes, sat on a raised dais, the tribunal, facingthe litigants with their patroniand legal advisers.16Juries were large,usually numbering 75, and after 70 B.C., comprised equally of sen-ators, equites, and tribuni aerarii(‘tribunes of the treasury,’ probably aslightly lower census group of the equites). The prosecution spoke first,followed by the speeches for the defense. Only then was evidenceusually taken. Thus, fairly lengthy set speeches were the norm, ratherthan the give-and-take with cross-examination that is characteristicof a modern courtroom. A magistrate or priest could convene a pub-lic meeting, a contio, as a preliminary discussion of legislation, or asa kind of political assembly wherein politicians might discuss impor-tant public questions. Contiones could be held in any number of places,but the forum was the most usual location, often in the meetingplace called the Comitium, adjacent to the Senate house. FergusMillar defines this open air face-to-face political system betweenspeaker and populusas the central element in late Republican Rome;and he estimates that as many as 20,000 people might have assem-bled in the forum for any particularly important event.17Thus, the forum was the prime location for political action inCicero’s day. But it was also the physical area used for many otherpurposes: in addition to furnishing space for public meetings (con-tiones), the standing courts of Rome (quaestiones), and some voting pro-cedures of the people, the forum was also the place where publiccontracts were allocated, oaths were taken, funeral orations weredelivered, triumphal processions were held, theatrical plays (ludi) werestaged, and gladiatorial combats (munera) were performed.18It shouldcome as no surprise then, that oratorical activity, conducted in the16For details on the Roman legal system, see A.

Consider this striking passage fromthe Brutus (290), wherein Cicero likens his image of his ideal speakerto Rome’s finest and most famous actor, the great Roscius (cf. alsoe.g., De oratore1.124–130, 259, 2.338, 3.214, 217 ff.):20I want my orator to have this experience: When people hear that heis to speak, all the places among the benches are taken, the tribunalis full, the clerks are gracious in assigning and giving up places, thecrowd is varied, the juror intent. When he rises to speak, silence issignalled by the crowd, followed by repeated applause and much admi-ration. They laugh when he wishes; when he wishes they cry; so thatif someone should catch sight of these proceedings from afar—even ifhe were unfamiliar with the case at issue—he would still recognizethat an orator was pleasing his audience and that a Roscius was onthe stage.21References to other public performers, such as gladiators, clearlyindicate that, just as the audience of a play or gladiatorial show inancient Rome expected a good performance from the actors involved,so did the audience of a speech demand a good show from the ora-tor. In Book 2.316–317 of De oratore, Antonius explicitly states thatentertainment and showmanship are demanded in a speech. In speak-ing about the prologue, he says:19See Griffin (1994): 689; J.

He claims that it is his habit to fight only after warm-ing up his arms. But he does not notice that the very gladiators fromwhom he draws this analogy hurl their first spears so gently, that theynot only attend to preserving their strength for what follows, but thatthe effect is also graceful in the extreme. And there is indeed no doubtthat the introduction of a speech seldom needs to be forceful and com-bative. But if, in the actual life-or-death struggle between gladiators,which is decided by the sword, many things still happen before theactual engagement which seem to have the potential not for inflictingwounds, but for putting on a display, how much more should this beexpected to happen in a speech, where the audience demands plea-sure rather than violence!22The analogy between orator and gladiator is also drawn in section325, and again in Book 3.200, where the speaker is compared notonly to a gladiator, but to a boxer in the palaestra as well:Then finally we must shape our orator with respect to both words andthoughts, so that he will act like those who fight with weapons or inthe palaestra: they believe that they should not only take account ofhow to strike and dodge, but also of how to move with grace...23Later in the same book Antonius makes an interesting statementabout the symbiotic relationship between orator and audience (2.338):It actually happens quite naturally that we are stirred to employ amore distinguished mode of oratory, because a public meeting pro-vides what might be called the orator’s greatest stage. For, just as aflute player cannot play without a flute, the crowd has a certain powerthat makes it impossible for an orator to be eloquent unless a crowdis listening.2422in quo admirari soleo non equidem istos, qui nullam huic rei operam dederunt, sed hominemin primis disertum atque eruditum, Philippum, qui ita solet surgere ad dicendum, ut quod pri-mum verbum habiturus sit nesciat; et ait idem, cum bracchium concalfecerit, tum se solere pugnare;neque attendit eos ipsos, unde hoc simile ducat, primas illas hastas ita iactare leniter, ut et venus-tati vel maxime serviant et reliquis viribus suis consulant.

In actual oratorical practice, this situation is perhaps mostvividly displayed in Cicero’s Pro Caelio, where, as Katherine Geffckenhas persuasively argued, Cicero decided to provide the jury (whohave come into the forum during the Ludi Megalenses not to attenda theatrical performance, but to make a decision about a charge ofviolence) with its own ludus scaenicus.25Caelius’ acquittal, the resultof Cicero’s masterful presentation of the case, is an indication of theaudience’s positive judgment of, among other things, his performance,a judgment here and elsewhere that Cicero regards in highest esteem—in fact as the ultimate benchmark of an orator’s success (see e.g., Deor.3.195 ff., esp. 197; cf. Brutus198–200).26His desire to hear theRoman audience’s cries of ‘bravo’ or ‘outstanding’ expressed in Deoratore, book 3 (101), as well as his description of their reactions toa mistake in terms of rhythm and meter (3.196: ‘. . . if the slightestmistake is made in these matters,...the entire theater cries out inprotest’) or in a song (3.196: ‘choruses and even soloists, if they singdicendi genus excitemur. habet enim multitudo vim quandam talem, ut, quem ad modum tibicensine tibiis canere, sic orator sine multitudine audiente eloquens esse non possit.25Geffcken (1973).26While the performance aspect of a public speech is obviously very significantin the Roman context, it goes too far to assume that the Romans didn’t really careabout the validity of a case and routinely sacrificed their own beliefs about a party’sguilt or innocence, basing their verdicts merely on the quality of the ‘performance’;cf. e.g., J. E. G. Zetzel, Review of C. P. Craig, Form as Argument in Cicero’s Speeches:A Study of Dilemma, Bryn Mawr Classical Review94.1.5: ‘What won the juries over wasnot the validity of Cicero’s case, but the amazing boldness of his argument; nottruth, but sheer, unmitigated effrontery. What Cicero makes almost explicit in thePro Caeliois true of his other speeches as well: they were entertainment, and theywere rewarded as performance.’ This position has been addressed effectively by A. Riggsby, “Did the Romans Believe in their Verdicts?” Rhetorica 7 (1997): 235–251;cf.

Cicero well-appreciated the great potential that proof based on character (ethos)offered the orator for persuading a Roman audience. In De oratore2.182, he discusses this potential in some detail:Well then, the character, the customs, the deeds, and the life, both ofthose who do the pleading and of those on whose behalf they plead,make a very important contribution to winning a case. These shouldbe approved of, and the corresponding elements in the opponentsshould meet with disapproval, and the minds of the audience should,as much as possible, be won over to feel goodwill toward the oratoras well as toward his client. Now people’s minds are won over by aman’s prestige, his accomplishments, and the reputation he has acquiredby his way of life. Such things are easier to embellish if present thanto fabricate if totally lacking, but at any rate, their effect is enhancedby a gentle tone of voice on the part of the orator, an expression onhis face intimating restraint, and kindliness in the use of his words;and if you press some point rather vigorously, by seeming to act againstyour inclination, because you are forced to do so. Indications offlexibility, on the part of the orator and the client, are also quite useful,as well as signs of generosity, mildness, dutifulness, gratitude, and ofnot being desirous or greedy. Actually all qualities typical of people27The best and most comprehensive account of the rhetorical means of persua-sion based on character and emotion (ethos and pathos) is by J. Wisse, Ethos andPathos from Aristotle to Cicero(Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert 1989).28Cf. J. M. May, Trials of Character: The Eloquence of Ciceronian Oratory(Chapel Hilland London: The University of North Carolina Press 1988): 1–12.60 . MAY_f4_49-70 7/11/02 7:16 PM Page 60"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"who are decent and unassuming, not severe, not obstinate, not litigious,not harsh, really win goodwill, and alienate the audience from thosewho do not possess them. And these same considerations must like-wise be employed to ascribe the opposite qualities to the opponents.29In this passage, the importance of character, not only the characterof the litigants, but that of their advocates as well is stressed. Thus,the rhetoric of advocacy, the normal situation in a Roman judicialcase, is accounted for (see above, 52–53); opportunities for employ-ing character as a source for persuasion are plentiful. We are toldexplicitly that the audience’s hearts are won over by a speaker’s pres-tige, his past accomplishments, the reputation of his life. Cicero’sactual speeches are replete with proof based on character, not onlythe character of his own client and his opponent(s), but constantreference to his own dignitas, blatant appeals to his own auctoritas,and repeated mention of his greatest accomplishments. Indeed, onoccasion these concerns, perhaps much to the surprise of a modernaudience, seem to overshadow, or even dominate the real issue ofthe case.30This kind of persuasion based on character (ethos) is, in Cicero’seyes, closely related to persuasion that finds its source in pathos, orthe stirring up of an audience’s vehement emotions (cf. e.g., De or.2.182–214, esp. 185 and 212; Orator128–133; Quintilian 6.2.8–17).Cicero continually claims that such emotional appeal is the mostimportant element for winning cases (cf. e.g., De or.1.17, 30, 53, 60,2.215, 337, 3.55, 105; Orator128–133), and he was justly proud of his own skill in this regard. Indeed, every Ciceronian oration isrich in passages of high emotion, several even ending with the ora-tor in tears, barely able to continue.31In an interesting passage in29Valet igitur multum ad vincendum probari mores et instituta et facta et vitam et eorum, quiagent causas, et eorum pro quibus, et item improbari adversariorum, animosque eorum apud quosagetur, conciliari quam maxime ad benevolentiam cum erga oratorem tum erga illum, pro quo dicetorator. conciliantur autem animi dignitate hominis, rebus gestis, existimatione vitae; quae faciliusornari possunt, si modo sunt, quam fingi, si nulla sunt.

I employed more of thesein my orations because, even if there were several speakers on ourside, they always left the closing to me . . . Nor is the appeal for pitythe only way in which the feelings of the jurors should be aroused—though I have generally employed it so passioniately that I have evenheld a baby in my arms during the peroration, and in another caseinvolving a noble defendant, I filled the forum with wailing and lamen-tation by calling him forward and raising up his small son,—but thejuror must be made to be angry or appeased, to be ill-or well-inten-tioned, to despise or admire, hate or love, desire or loathe, hope orfear, to feel joy or sorrow...Indeed, there is no conceivable methodof arousing or soothing the mind of a listener that I have not tried—I would say brought to perfection, if I judged it were so, and if itwere true, I would not fear the charge of conceit.32The celebrated defense of Norbanus, described by Cicero in De ora-tore 2.197 ff., stands for him as a paradigm of a speech that com-bined both ethos and pathos effectively.33The prosecutor Sulpiciusnot only had everything going for his case, but had also apparentlyemployed pathos so much to his own advantage that he ‘turned overto Antonius not a court case (iudicium), but a conflagration (incendium)’(De or. 2.202)! Then he describes how his opponent Antonius putout the fire (2.202–203):32Quid ego de miserationibus loquar? quibus eo sum usus pluribus quod, etiam si plures dice-bamus, perorationem mihi tamen omnes relinquebant...Nec vero miseratione solum mens iudicumpermovenda est—qua nos ita dolenter uti solemus ut puerum infantem in manibus perorantes tenuer-imus, ut alia in causa excitato reo nobili, sublato etiam filio parvo plangore et lamentatione com-pleremus forum—sed est faciendum etiam, ut irascatur iudex mitigetur, invideat faveat, contemnatadmiretur, oderit diligat, cupiat taedeat, speret metuat, laetetur doleat...Nullo enim modo ani-mus audientis aut incitari aut leniri potest, qui modus a me non temptatus sit—dicerem perfec-tum, si ita iudicarem, nec in veritate crimen arrogantiae pertimescerem.Cf. De oratore 2.194b–196,where Cicero describes the famous defense of the old general Manius Aquillius byM. Antonius: having sensed that the jurors were moved at the sight of a formerconsul and decorated military commander now in court, weakened, grief-stricken,and dressed in mourning clothes, Antonius raised up his client and tore openAquillius’ tunic, laying bare the scars that he had sustained on behalf of them andthe state. Cicero himself appears to have imitated this emotional ploy in his owndefense of C. Rabirius; see A. R. Dyck, “Dressing to Kill: Attire as a Proof andMeans of Characterization in Cicero’s Speeches,” Arethusa34 (2001): 121.33See Wisse (1989): 269–282 for a detailed analysis of this speech.62 . MAY_f4_49-70 7/11/02 7:16 PM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":". . . immortal gods, what a remarkable prologue you used!

On the other hand, the two elements of a speech, ‘one thatrecommends (i.e., ethos), the other that excites (i.e., pathos),’ playedconstant and primary roles. ‘This implied,’ Antonius continues, ‘giv-ing the impression both of being very passionate when rekindlingthe indignation against Caepio, and of being very mild when demon-strating my character in my dealings with those to whom I ambound.

In 92 B.C., Rutilius, aparagon of virtue and honored member of the community (De or.1.229) was tried and unjustly convicted of corruption that had allegedlyoccurred while he was serving in Asia a few years earlier.35As astaunch Stoic, he refused during his trial, as did Socrates, to employemotional appeals, and ‘did not even want his case to be arguedwith any more embellishment or freedom than the plain truth ofthe matter allowed’ (1.229; cf. Brutus113–115). But according to theinterlocutor, Antonius, the disastrous result could have been avoided.If Crassus had spoken for the defense on that occasion, the powerof his oratory would have carried the day. Unfortunately for Rutiliusand the state, this was not the case:As it is, a man of such caliber has been lost to us because his casewas pleaded as if the matter were conducted in that imaginary stateof Plato’s. None of his advocates uttered a groan or a shout, therewas nothing that pained any of them, none complained or appealedto the Roman State or begged for mercy—why say more? During theentire trial, none of them even stamped his foot, for fear, I suppose,of being reported to the Stoics! A Roman, actually a former consul,thus followed the famous example of Socrates of old, who was the wis-est of men and had lived entirely blamelessly. When on trial for hislife, he pleaded his own case in such a way that he seemed not adefendant or a suppliant at the mercy of the jury, but rather theirteacher or master (1.230–231).36If we are safe in assuming that the goal of oratory is persuasion,and that this goal is met by orators in various societies by employ-35See R.

The cases are presented by lawyers, modern juriscon-sults, not orators, and although there may be flashes of eloquence,some appeal to character or emotional grandstanding, the jury expects,for the most part, to be persuaded by ‘the plain truth.’ The jurorin Republican Rome, on the other hand, seems to have expectedsomething more—an argument not only stated straightforwardly andin a way that appeared convincingly true, but also heavily corrob-orated by character and appeal to emotion, presented by a profes-sional speaker, usually not a jurisconsult, whose methods were moreakin in delivery to those of an actor rather than to a modern-daylawyer.In such an emotionally charged atmosphere, within the surroundingsof the Roman forum, it is easy to see how rowdy behavior, andeven violence, which had been part and parcel of the Roman polit-ical scene for some time,37might break out in the court or at a pub-lic meeting. Perhaps the most extreme example of violence surroundinga Ciceronian oration is his defense of Milo, who was being tried forthe murder of his arch-enemy Clodius. Before the trial, the unrulymob had burned the Senate house, and during the trial, the soleconsul, Pompey, who had already revised the legal procedures to befollowed during the trial to reduce the chance of violence and bribery,enlisted an armed guard to surround the proceedings to ensure somesort of order in the forum.38We need not, however, resort to suchextraordinary cases to find instances of rowdy, violent behavior inthe context of a Roman court of law.

Those arguments that seemed to us tobe the heart of his case, strictly relevant to the point at issue, wouldcertainly be presented clearly and persuasively, but they might tendto be overshadowed, or if weak, entirely obscured by other consid-erations that are intrinsically irrelevant. He would speak from mem-ory, and his delivery would perhaps appear to us rather stilted orstylized, certainly exaggerated, with an occasional slap of the fore-head, the thigh, and a stomp of the foot, a controlled gesture of thehand, the finger, a darting glance of the eye; his voice would betrained to modulate often, running the gamut of its range of pitch,almost as though it were controlled by cues from a flutist (cf. De or.3.224–227). He would talk much about his client’s good character,his fine reputation, his glorious deeds, his opponent’s bad character,lack of prestige, and ability. If he himself happened to be an impor-tant person in the State, a consul or ex-consul perhaps, much wouldbe made of his own authority, his own experience, his own bene-factions for the community. He would not endeavor to appear hum-ble, but might even spend long stretches talking about himself inwhat seems to us an egotistical way, hoping to lend some of his ownauthority to his client’s case. He might digress from the major pointat issue, perhaps for a major part of the speech, either to delighthis audience, ingratiate them, confound them, or stir their emotions(De or. 2.311–312). In this connection, he would resort to every kindof histrionic trick—dressing in squalid clothes,40holding children inhis arms, bringing relatives and grieving parents forward, tearing hisclient’s shirt open to show the wounds he had sustained for the state.We would be given the impression that he felt intimately every emo-tion he tried to rouse in us, and he would even go to the point ofassuming different moods and characters in his manner of speech(De or. 2.189–196). Tears would be plentiful, shed on all sides, perhapsthere would even be supplication from the knees.

Born in 106 B.C.,1educated after the age of10 in Rome, he would have received the toga virilis, the ‘toga ofmanhood,’ in about 90, the beginning of a decade in Rome markedby appalling political violence. The election to the consulship of L. Cornelius Sulla in 88 was soon followed by the unprecedentedspectacle of a Roman general unleashing a Roman army against hisfellow citizens, the aftermath of the attempt by the tribune P. SulpiciusRufus to transfer Sulla’s military command against Mithradates ofPontus to the aging Gaius Marius. After Sulla’s first march on Rome,his elimination of many of his enemies, and his subsequent depar-ture for the East, he was simultaneously outlawed and allowed towage war against Rome’s enemies in Greece and Asia Minor. Duringhis absence, Rome endured the domination of L. Cornelius Cinnaand his allies, whose return to the city with Marius after Sulla’sdeparture was accompanied by the slaughter of their political ene-mies, including one of the greatest orators of the day, Marcus Antonius.A new spasm of violence began with the death of Cinna in 84,at which Sulla declared himself in rebellion against the governmentand prepared to return to Italy to wage war against his domesticopponents. Among those murdered in Rome in the months beforethe outbreak of that conflict was Q. Mucius Scaevola, the aged law711All dates are B.C.

Despite Scaevola’s previous will-ingness to work with the Cinnan government and despite his posi-tion as head of the state religion, his death was ordered by thepraetor of 82. The victory of Sulla at the Colline Gate began anotherbloodletting, a reign of terror given a semblance of legality by thepublication of lists of the proscribed, i.e., those citizens who couldbe killed with impunity. If large-scale purges and civic violence cameto a temporary end during the years of Sullan dominance (82–79),it was in large part because many citizens with strong political sen-timents and the courage to fight for them had been killed or drivenoffby one side or the other. Thus, in 81, still mourning the violentdeaths of many of the men he had admired and learned from, andexquisitely aware not only of the dangers of opposing a leader suchas Sulla but even of remaining neutral under the domination of amilitary dynast, Cicero embarked on his public career.1.The Pro QuinctioCicero’s first published speech, the Pro Quinctio, was delivered in 81under Sulla dictator. At the beginning of this oration Cicero speaksof other cases he had undertaken; we may assume, therefore, thathe had appeared in earlier civil actions during the same year. Thespeech for Quinctius was probably the most noteworthy of these—in part because opposing him in the case had been Q. HortensiusHortalus, the foremost orator in Rome at that time. In this speechand in the Pro Roscio Amerino of the following year, Cicero alludesoften to his youth and inexperience.2It would be a mistake, how-ever, to make too much of the orator’s claimed lack of sophistica-tion and maturity at this time. His preparation for his debut hadbeen a thorough one under the guidance of some of the most emi-nent orators and legal minds of the day, and—according to Plutarch(Cic.2.2)—Cicero’s brilliance as a student had been such that thefathers of those he studied with had come to listen to him declaim.Furthermore, his period of preparation had been unusually long, nodoubt a result of the political troubles of the 80s.

In the Pro Quinctioand the Pro Roscio Amerino Cicero’sclear division of each speech into exordium or introduction, narra-tion, partition (detailing the main points at issue and/or the intendedstructure of the subsequent argument), proof or argument, and per-oration or closing is highlighted by explicit signals to his audienceof his progress from one part to another.5The handling of the con-tent of these partesis also recognizable from school rhetoric. Rhetoricaltreatises advised the orator to win the goodwill of his audience inthe exordium, for instance, by expatiating on the difficulties facedby oneself and one’s client and by describing the power, influence,and cruelty of one’s opponents. Accordingly, in the exordia of theseearly speeches we see Cicero painting himself as inexperienced, untal-ented, and hampered by various procedural difficulties, while hisclient is a pathetic victim of singular unfairness and ill will, possessedof limited resources and few friends. His clients’ merciless opponents,on the other hand, are said to wield ‘extraordinary influence’ (Quinct.1: summa gratia), in the case of Quinctius’ enemy S. Naevius, and‘extraordinary power’ (Rosc.

In fact, in thisperiod the increasingly common employment of—and thus the lis-teners’ familiarity with—received rhetorical structures, strategies, argu-ments, and commonplaces would have made the challenge of creatinga compelling and persuasive speech even greater. And here it mustbe remembered that a merely aesthetic success was no success at all.Cicero’s audience, while expecting a high level of artistic finish, hadto believe that he was telling them the truth if he were to achievehis primary aim.Success for the Roman orator, then, depended to a great extenton the creative application of school rhetoric, and the creativity ofCicero’s manipulation of stock rhetorical elements is evident even inthese early speeches, perhaps nowhere more than in the image hepaints of himself, his clients, and his opponents. We have noted thatHellenistic rhetorical theory gave advice concerning the assigning ofethical traits in the exordium of a speech.7In these speeches, how-ever, Cicero has already integrated such prescriptions into a morecomplex whole, imprinting throughout the speech a lasting impres-sion in the minds of his audience of various characters and, in turn,fitting these characters into a larger picture of Roman society.6See, esp., F. Solmsen, “Cicero’s First Speeches, a Rhetorical Analysis,” in KleineSchriften, 3 vols. (Hildesheim: Olms, 1968–82) 2: 231–45; and Kennedy (1972):138–48.7On the exordium, see Cic.

It is in his portrait of Naevius, however, where we see in embryothe skills that would make Cicero the most successful of Roman ora-tors. The Pro Quinctioillustrates that, for better or worse, Ciceroseems always to have been adept in the art of attacking his oppo-nents not just by arraigning their conduct in particular circumstancesbut by transforming such conduct into a general pattern of behav-ior with wide implications. Over and over in this speech Cicero usesthe concept of the traditional vir bonusas a standard against whichto judge Naevius’ actions: Naevius’ father never possessed any propertyor else had squandered it, for his son received no inheritance (11);Naevius himself was a ‘scurra’ or urban sharpster who not only hungabout the auction halls but had himself been a ‘praeco’ or auction-eer (11–12); Naevius’ friends were men who were to be found indisreputable locations (25); Naevius’ employment of the speech of agentleman was belied by his actions (16); and when Naevius attemptedto recoup the money he allegedly was owed by Quinctius, he demon-strated clearly how far he was from understanding how a gentlemanacts towards a kinsman, a business partner, and a friend (38).8The strategy is especially evident in an extended passage (48–56)in which Cicero defines for his audience the behavior of an authen-tic vir bonusin the circumstances faced by Naevius, claiming thatsuch a man would do practically anything rather than attack theproperty and civil status of a relative and business associate. Cicerothen assumes the personaof Naevius, who laughs at the ‘madness’ ofCicero and the judges (55: nostram amentiam) because they were attempt-ing to find in his life ‘consideration of an overriding duty’ (55: rationemsummi offici) and ‘the practices of gentlemen’ (55: instituta virorum bono-rum). According to the orator, Naevius would respond to such con-cerns in the following words (55):8See C. Damon, The Mask of the Parasite (Ann Arbor: University of MichiganPress 1997): 195–206, a perceptive discussion of the traits assigned to Naevius andthe tacit connection of these traits to those of the literary parasite, especially asfound in Lucilius.’  75MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 75"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"What do I care about your high flown virtue and moral scrupulous-ness? Let gentlemen worry about those sorts of duties; as for me, peopleshould consider not what I possess, but how I acquired it, and whatstatus I was born to, and how I was brought up.9Here Cicero’s ironic prosopopoeia (i.e., dramatic personification) leadshis listeners to consider the nature of social and ethical bonitas. Thepassage implicitly elevates ethical conduct (quibus rebus invenerim),upbringing (quo pacto educatus) and birth (quem ad modum natus) overwealth (quid habeam) as criteria by which to judge the vir bonus. Cicerothus attempts to isolate Naevius from decent society and to undermineany claim to respectability on his part based solely on his possessionof property and influence. The final step in the ethical dismantlingof Naevius comes in Cicero’s summary of the characters of the twoformer business partners in the peroration. Quinctius and Naeviusare now transformed from individuals into symbols of opposing waysof life: the simple, humble, and honest husbandman—the very arche-type for the elder Cato of the vir bonus (Agr.1)—stands opposed tothe ruthless and grasping parvenu. What is at issue, Cicero assertsin one of the final passages of the speech, is ‘whether rustic andunpolished frugality can defend itself against extravagance and licen-tiousness or whether, dishonored and robbed of all marks of dis-tinction, it is to be given up naked to greed and insolence’ (92).102.The Pro Roscio AmerinoWe do not know whether the judge and his assessors ultimately wereconvinced either by Cicero’s argument that Naevius had acted ille-gally or by his construction of Naevius as a scoundrel and Quinctiusas a rustic victim. We do know that Cicero went on to employ manyof the same ethical strategies he had used in the Pro Quinctio in thePro Roscio Amerino, his first criminal case, argued in the following year.The trial involved an accusation of parricide against Sextus Roscius9‘Quid mihi,’ inquit, ‘cum ista summa sanctimonia ac diligentia? viderint,’ inquit, ‘ista officiaviri boni, de me autem ita considerent: non quid habeam, sed quibus rebus invenerim quaerant,et quem ad modum natus et quo pacto educatus sim...’Cf., contra, Damon’s interpreta-tion (1997) of the passage based on the inclusion of the word meminiin this clauserather than in the one following.10utrum possitne se contra luxuriem ac licentiam rusticana illa atque inculta parsimonia defenderean deformata atque ornamentis omnibus spoliata nuda cupiditati petulantiaeque addicatur.76 MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 76"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"of Ameria, whose father had appeared on the list of those proscribedunder Sulla. Sulla had probably at this time resigned his dictatorship,restored—at least nominally—normal functions to the government,and was himself acting as consul, although there would have beenno illusions about his potential for violent intervention at any time.11Cicero divides the Pro Rosciointo the standard partesof a forensicspeech, subdividing the proof into three parts, as he had done inthe Pro Quinctio. But, according to Friedrich Solmsen, the nature ofthese subdivisions in the Pro Rosciowould have ‘shocked’ the teach-ers of school rhetoric, who would have expected the orator to con-struct his proof by means of the so-called staseisof Hellenistic theory.12This complex system of analysis of the possible grounds of defense(or prosecution) in any cause would have the orator begin by deter-mining whether arguments might be created on the basis of fact(‘My client didn’t do it.’); definition (‘My client did it, but it was nota crime.’); quality (‘What my client did was, perhaps, illegal, butabsolutely necessary to achieve a higher good.’); or procedure (‘Myclient cannot be tried on this charge by this court at this time.’).Thus in the Pro QuinctioCicero’s defense had turned on a factualissue—his denial that Naevius had legally taken possession of theproperty of his client—and his proof supported this denial by argu-ing three contentions: that Naevius had had no legal grounds toapply to the praetor to take possession; that he couldnot have takenpossession legally; and that he didnot take possession legally.In the Pro Roscio, however, only the first of the three sections intowhich Cicero divides his proof is ostensibly structured according tostasistheory: the address to the prosecutor Erucius concerning thecrimenor charge (37–82), which Cicero rebuts by asserting that Rosciusdid not have the character, motive, or opportunity to kill his father,nor was there any evidence to prove that he had, in fact, done so.The other two parts of the proof are organized thematically andethically, dealing first (83–123) with Sextus’ enemies T.

Roscius Magnus as embodiments of ‘boldness’ (audacia) andthen with Chrysogonus (124–142) as the embodiment of the unjustand intolerable exercise of power (potentia). The passages dealing withCapito and Magnus exploit the kind of character drawing adum-brated in the Pro Quinctio: these two are portrayed, like Naevius, asunscrupulous urban scoundrels, profiting from the civil wars not (likeNaevius) as auctioneers, but as brokers of the property of the pro-scribed. In addition, Cicero makes use of the strategy of anticatego-ria,13the turning of an accusation back on one’s accuser, by chargingCapito and Magnus with the creation of a criminal conspiracy result-ing in the murder of Roscius’ father, the seizure of his property, andthe indictment of his son for the murder.The most compelling section of the argument, however, is the lastpart, in which Cicero launches an attack on Sulla’s freedman, Chryso-gonus, under whose protection the conspiracy of Capito and Magnusto dispossess and accuse Sextus Roscius had allegedly taken place.In fact, it is Chrysogonus’ personaand actions that tie the entirespeech together. The force of the proem had depended on Cicero’srevelation that it was Chrysogonus who had victimized Roscius, intim-idated his noble defenders, and required the defendant to put hislife in the hands of the heroic but inexperienced young orator. Thespeech then builds to sections 124–142, the capstone of the tripar-tite proof. Unfortunately, an extended lacuna appears here, butenough of this section of the speech is present for us to understandthe main lines of Cicero’s attack, which begins with the memorableline, ‘I come now to that golden name of Chrysogonus’ (124: Venionunc ad illud nomen aureum Chrysogoni).A key aspect of Cicero’s strategy here, already exploited to someextent in the Pro Quinctio, is the attempt to separate his opponentfrom the latter’s powerful supporters. Cicero isolates Chrysogonus,as he had Naevius, by casting aspersions on his character, social sta-tus, and birth, which stand in marked contrast to his wealth andinfluence. The attack on Chrysogonus, although more dangerousthan that on Naevius because of Chrysogonus’ connections to Sulla,was made considerably easier by the fact that Chrysogonus, as a(probably Greek, certainly foreign) freedman, was manifestly notavir bonus. Therefore the young orator could capitalize on the resent-13See Quintilian 3.10.4, 7.2.9.78 MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"ment a powerful former slave would arouse in those who consideredthemselves his social superiors.And it was not only Chrysogonus’ power that would have beenresented, but the wealth that accompanied it. Cicero, therefore,exhibiting a striking talent for enargeia, or vivid description, summonsup the sights and sounds associated with Chrysogonus’ luxuriouslifestyle: his numerous estates and villas, his possession of a new-fangled oven that cost as much as a house, his Corinthian and Delianvases, the sound of the stringed instruments and flutes that could beheard wafting from his house at all hours. Cicero surely realized thateven those listeners not inclined to envy such a lifestyle would haveassociated this luxury with the bloodshed that had produced it—anassociation reinforced throughout the speech by the use of termshaving to do with banditry and plunder whenever such riches arealluded to.14Cicero rubs salt in the psychological wounds produced bythese images by describing the former slave arrogantly ‘flitting about’(135: volitet) the Forum, attended by a retinue of Roman citizens.In addition to attacking Chrysogonus on moral and social grounds,Cicero attempts to sever the bonds that connected him to Sulla,since there were many who, out of fear or ambition—and no mat-ter how morally despicable they believed Chrysogonus to be—mighthave held their noses and voted to convict Roscius if they believedthat Sulla wished them to do so. The strategy Cicero adopts tocounter the perception of a close tie between the freedman and hispatron is to offer Sulla a kind of plausible deniability. He declaresthat some covert wrongdoings are bound to escape a man so dis-tracted by the demands of sole governance. ‘No one,’ says Cicero,‘can be so blessed that, in such a large household, he has no ras-cally slave or freedman.’15Later in the speech (131), in a much moresurprising analogy (and which some have even thought to be ironic),the orator implicitly compares Sulla to Jupiter, who is surely notresponsible for the fact that disasters sometimes occur while hisattention is turned elsewhere. In such passages Cicero, in effect, dares Sulla to contradict him and thereby assume responsibility forChrysogonus and his actions. While this was a gamble, it was a well14The use of the term praeda (booty) is especially frequent.

The tone adopted here and throughout the exordiumsuggests that Cicero, because of his youth, his inexperience, and theevident dangers the political aspect of the case posed, would gladlyhave avoided taking on the defense of Roscius at all. Only his senseof honor and duty demanded his participation in the case. Here hepresents himself as a brave young advocate, facing not his nominalopponent, the professional prosecutor Erucius—a man clearly beneathhim in terms of social standing and connections—but rather a groupof conspirators supported by ‘perhaps the most powerful young manin the state at this time,’ Chrysogonus. The battle, as he describesit, is clearly unequal; nevertheless, Cicero ‘will not lose spirit andwill bear that which he has undertaken as far as he is able.’ ‘If Iam unable to support [this burden],’ he declares, ‘I prefer to becrushed beneath the weight of duty rather than either to cast offthrough faithlessness or to lay down through weakness of spirit thatobligation which has been placed in my trust.’17Without discounting the element of peril the case represented, theimpression given by passages such as these may be questioned, forin many ways the defense of Roscius represented an extraordinaryopportunity for Cicero. Because he was of the ‘municipal aristoc-racy,’ a novus homo, his ascent up the cursus honorumin Rome wouldbe a difficult one.18There would be no early cooptation into a major16On the support for Roscius among the aristocracy, see A.

In any case, unless a young man could, likeStrabo’s son Pompey, raise a private army of clients, even those ofmilitary genius had to wait for election to the higher offices to winthat sort of renown. It was on the battlefield of the law courts thatCicero would begin the process of winning public honor.Despite his claim in the Pro Roscio, therefore, that only his senseof duty had led him to take on the defense of Roscius, Cicero nodoubt embraced the opportunity presented by the case to introduceand define himself before a large popular audience. Clearly, one seg-ment of the nobility was using Cicero in this case to send a signalto Sulla that the time when men like Chrysogonus would be givena free hand was over, at least if Sulla wished them to participate inthe ‘new dispensation.’ But if Cicero were to serve the nobility inthis way, they must realize that he would use the opportunity tosend a message of his own. In his defense of Roscius, therefore, hemakes no effort to play down the political aspects of the case but,on the contrary, to cast them in bold relief, thereby presenting him-self as a potential leader, a spokesman for his class and for what heasserts to be the interests of the state as a whole. At several pointshe even emphasizes the fact that in his remarks de republicahe wasspeaking on his own behalf rather than as Roscius’ defender. Thus,in section 129, he asserts that ‘...what seems to me myself unjustand unbearable, and what I believe will affect us all unless we takemeasures to prevent it, this I declare for myself, out of my own senseof mental distress.’19In this speech, then, we witness the young Cicero addressing bothhis original as well as his reading audience on crucial political issues,crafting a public image that would transcend the circumstances ofD.

But unlikethe defendant, heclaims for himself the right to criticize the actions and contemplatedactions of the leaders of that cause, as part of his patriotic concernfor the state as a whole. Cicero even presumes to warn those nobleswho would commit or approve acts such as those of Chrysogonusthat unless they ‘are vigilant and good and brave and merciful theymust cede their honors to those who possess these qualities’ (139).20Cicero’s most memorable political comments come in the per-oration—that part of the speech traditionally devoted to an emo-tional appeal for pity—in which he pleads for a new humanitasthatwill wash away the miseries of the recent civil war and its after-math. Here, he transforms Roscius into a symbol of all whose par-ents had been destroyed by the proscriptions, demanding on theirbehalf and on behalf of the republic as a whole that bloodshed andcruelty not be allowed to extend to their generation. The languagehere is elevated, and the power of the sentiments, voiced to an audi-ence that had endured all the miseries of those violent years, shouldnot be undervalued:Abolish this [cruelty] from the state, judges; do not allow it to resideany longer in this republic.

Looking back on the Pro RoscioAmerino some forty years later, Cicero took a good deal of pride inthe speech, quoting from his passionate and highly ornate discussionof the just punishment devised for parricides (Rosc. Am.72) and recall-ing the applause that followed his delivery of the passage—a com-monplace cleverly stolen from the armory of the prosecution.23Andyet he found his style in the speech, and during this early period ofhis career, wanting in certain respects. His subsequent study withthe Rhodian rhetorician Molon, he writes, was aimed at temperinghis delivery, which had strained his voice and health, and moderat-ing his oratorical style, which—although winning popular applause—he felt not to have been sufficiently ‘clarified’ or ‘cooled down’ (Orat.107: nequaquam satis defervisse). At that time, Cicero wrote, he was ‘tooabundant and overflowing with a youthful, as it were, license andlack of restraint’ (Brut. 316: nimis redundantis nos et supra fluentis iuveniliquadam dicendi impunitate et licentia reprimeret et quasi extra ripas diffluentiscoerceret).This assessment of his early speeches was written by Cicero aspart of three works—De Optimo Genere Oratorum, Brutus, and Orator—produced in the middle 40’s and constituting a tendentious apolo-gia for his rhetorical style. The immediate impetus for this defensewas the criticism of Cicero by a group of young Romans known as‘Atticists’—a disparate group of individuals, reacting to a variety ofinfluences.24There were those, for instance, whose embrace of a22For Cicero’s claim of poor health, see Brut. 314; for Sulla’s displeasure, seePlut.

Wisse concludes thatRoman Atticism began under the leadership of Calvus between 60 and 55, butonly became a significant movement after Calvus’ death (54/53?), thus promptingCicero’s treatment of the issue in the treatises of the 40’s.’  83MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 83"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"straightforward and unemotional style of oratory had philosophical,and particularly, Stoic roots and whose patron saint would have beena man like P.

There were also those whosesearch for new models for Latin public discourse was, no doubt, areaction to the political cant of the day. Like Sallust, they wouldhave lamented the corruption of political rhetoric and have strivenfor an idiom that used language to confront, to disturb, to force itsclaim to truth by rejecting a smooth, finished, and polished style. Asmodels in their efforts to ‘problematize’ Latin style, such critics lookedto the roughness of the archaic Latin orators, as well as to the abrupt-ness and complexity of Thucydides. What united these individualswas not so much the similarity of their oratorical styles as their rejec-tion of the dominant rhetorical mode of the day, represented by noone so much as by Cicero, whose carefully elaborated periods, lib-eral use of ornamentation and prose rhythm, and highly chargedappeals to the emotions of his listeners became the object of criti-cism by C.

The term redundantiawas forCicero’s critics of the 40’s one of opprobrium and a defining viceof ‘Asianism,’ signifying a florid and overblown style imported intoRome from the Greek East and embodying the aesthetic oppositeof their Latin ideal.

In Cicero’s rhetoricalvocabulary, however, youthful redundantiawas not a vice stemmingfrom a mistaken ideological allegiance to a particular style of ora-tory; it was, rather, a kind of virtue—a necessary step in the devel-opment of the orator. A passage from a much earlier treatise (i.e.55), the De Oratore, in which Cicero depicts Antonius recalling thefirst time he heard Sulpicius pleading a case, is of special interest.The word he uses here to describe Sulpicius’ age, adulescentulus, isthe same he would later use in the Orator(107) to describe his ownage at the time of the Pro Roscio Amerino. At this time, observesAntonius, Sulpicius possessed the requisites of voice and form andmovement that one would desire in an orator. His style, however,was ‘hurried and impetuous’ (oratione...celeri et concitata), which hebelieves to be an indication of his natural talent, while his dictionwas ‘boiling and somewhat too abundant’ (verbis effervescentibus et paulonimium redundantibus), which Antonius expects in one of his age.

They are indeed vices—and any reader of the earliest orationscan discern the stylistic faults to which they refer—but they are thevices of an orator of ability who has not yet learned to control thetools of his art. Such an orator possesses an abundance of energyand a superfluity of material, out of which all excellence of contentand style ultimately flow.2726Non sum aspernatus; volo enim se efferat in adulescente fecunditas: nam sicut facilius, invitibus, revocantur ea, quae se nimium profuderunt, quam, si nihil valet materies, nova sarmentacultura excitantur: item volo esse in adulescente, unde aliquid amputem; non enim potest in eosucus esse diuturnus, quod nimis celeriter est maturitatem exsecutum.27Cf.

In fact, especially if we date the Pro Roscio Comoedoto the years immediately after his return from the East, no suchstriking change is discernable.28The hallmarks of Ciceronian style,most of which have been identified with ‘Asianism,’ appear in thespeeches of all periods, early and late. Among these we might men-tion: complex periodicity, often making use of elaborate parallelism;the presence of rhythm, both in the sense of the employment ofclauses within periods that are carefully balanced in length and sound,as well as the employment of favored combination of long and shortsyllables at the ends of periods (clausulae); constant use of a wide vari-ety of ornamenta, involving both word and phrase, aimed at artisticexpression and often privileging sound and general impression overprecision of meaning; recourse to wit, irony, wordplay, and humor;employment of variatioat all levels, including within the period,between periods, between parts of a speech, as well as in the stylesemployed in different types of speech; and the constant appeal tothe emotions, especially in the opening and the closing sections ofthe speeches.29It thus appears probable that the greatest change that took placein Ciceronian oratory during the early period as a result of Cicero’sstudy abroad was in actiorather than elocutio. The demands of fre-quent address before large crowds—and it was not simply the judgesby whom Cicero wished to be heard—put strains on an orator’svoice not unlike those on an opera singer, and Cicero declares thatafter the training he received from Molon and others, his voice andhealth never gave him further trouble.

Perhaps the mostinteresting aspect of this speech is that within it Cicero has incor-porated a kind of rhetorical handbook. Under the guise of instruct-ing Caecilius in the daunting requirements of taking on such a case,especially when the opposing counsel would be the formidableHortensius, Cicero provides an orationis ratio (27–47), listing the pow-ers of invention, arrangement, and memory needed to organize thecase, present it clearly, and engage the emotions of the listeners. Hespeaks as well of the experience, training, ingenuity, and powerfulconnections required to outwit the traps that would be set by Hortensiusand of the need for a prosecutor who was himself blameless of anysuspicion of participation in Verres’ crimes. Within the speech, thevery style Cicero employs further supports his claims for preference,for the work is studded with virtuoso passages, probably not as ameans of overawing the judges but as a preview of the kind of rhetor-ical power he could marshal when it came to the public trial.The second extant speech in the Verrine corpus is termed an ActioPrima, but is quite unlike the long set speech that would usually havebeen given at the opening of a quaestio de repetundis. In fact, the bulkof the Actio Prima is an explanation of why Cicero had decided toforego such a speech. According to Cicero, Verres and his support-ers had based their expectation of securing his acquittal on the vastsums he had extorted in the third year of his Sicilian governorship,which would be used to bribe his judges. Their hope that the courtwould be open to corruption was raised by the election in the con-sular comitiaof 70 of Hortensius (Verres’ principal defender) as oneconsul and Q. Metellus (also a supporter of Verres) as the other.Furthermore, Quintus Metellus’ brother Marcus had been electedpraetor and would therefore preside over the trial if it were to takeplace after the first of January, 69. It was Verres’ aim, therefore, todelay the beginning or, at least, the completion of the trial until afterthat date. One means of accomplishing this delay involved securinga prosecutor to indict the returning governor of Achaea, therebycausing this trial to be scheduled before that of Verres could begin.Cicero, however, gathered the evidence for his prosecution so rapidlythat he had returned from Sicily and was ready to commence hiscase before the prosecutor of the other case had even arrived atBrundisium in order to make his way to Greece. Verres’ hopes fora delay were not entirely dashed, since the Roman calendar of fes-tival days would most likely force the trial to extend into the new88 MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 88"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"year, necessitating the empanelment of a new group of judges afterthe first of the year. Cicero’s countermove to this threatened delaywas to replace the long opening speech usually given in such caseswith a much shorter speech (the extant Actio Prima), followed imme-diately by the introduction of witnesses and documents supportingeach of the charges. In effect, Cicero was announcing to his audi-ence in the Actio Primathat he would try the first part of the casenot through extended rhetorical argument—in rhetorical terms, knownas ‘artistic proof ’—but through the use of specific charges, witnesses,and documents—that is, through ‘inartistic proof.’31The tone of the extant Actio Prima is markedly different from thatof the Divinatio. The virtuoso passages of the earlier speech are gone,replaced by a kind of Realpolitikanalysis of the circumstances of thetrial, whereby Cicero claims to give the judges a glimpse of themachinations which lay beneath the surface of events. Gone as wellis the focus of the earlier speech on the wishes and sufferings of theSicilians; here, Cicero is almost exclusively concerned with the impactof the case on Roman politics.The structure of the speech, although different in various respectsfrom that of an ordinary forensic speech, nevertheless mimics thepartesoutlined by rhetorical theory. The beginning of the exordium(1–10) immediately turns to the thematic crux of the oration: thatin this case it is not just Verres who is on trial, but the senatorialordoitself. According to Cicero, if Verres is acquitted, the manifestguilt of the defendant as well as his vast wealth will lead everyoneto conclude that Verres had successfully bribed his judges. The resultof such an event would be a further increase in the current invidiaordinis and the infamia iudiciorum. In these passages Cicero does notexplicitly refer to a bill that had been recently promulgated at thetime of the trial to remove the juries from the exclusive control ofthe senate, but allusions to the discrimen ordinis iudiciorumque vestrorumwould not have been misunderstood by the audience. This tone ofwarning is complemented by Cicero’s presentation of the case as aheaven-sent opportunity for the senatorial jurors: while an acquittalwill involve them in popular invidia and infamia, a conviction willallow them to recover the good opinion and favor of the Romanpeople.31On ‘artistic’ and ‘inartistic’ proof, see G. Kennedy, Aristotle.

At the point in the ora-tion where we would expect the proof or argumentumto occur, Ciceroinserts a statement of his political stance (32–42). Here he declaresthat the case against Verres which he had originally undertaken onbehalf of the Sicilians would be pursued by him for the sake of therepublic. Furthermore, he announces that he will in the followingyear dedicate his newly won aedileship to rooting out judicial cor-ruption. The oration ends with a return in the peroration (43–56)to the themes introduced in the proem. While never rising to thegrand style, it includes a vehement plea, not for justice for the stateas a whole or vengeance for the Sicilians but for deliverance of thesenatorial order from the odium, invidia, infamia, and turpitudo whichit had reaped from the corruption of the courts. ‘This is a trial,’Cicero states, ‘in which you will pass judgment on the defendant,and the people of Rome will pass judgment on you’ (47).325.The Actio Secunda in VerremA salient fact about the five books of the Second Action againstVerres, comprising some 350 pages in the Oxford Classical Textedition, is that it was never delivered and therefore would not havebeen written until after the suspension of the trial.33Sometime afterthe Actio Primaand the testimony of witnesses, Verres fled Rome forexile in Massilia (Marseille). Despite this fact, Cicero published theActio Secunda, along with the Divinatio in Caeciliumand the Actio Prima,apparently shortly after Verres’ departure, maintaining the fictionthat the trial had actually gone forward and that Verres had beenpresent throughout.While it was not unprecedented for a Roman orator to publishhis speeches, there is no evidence that any Roman before Cicerohad published a work quite like the Actio Secunda.34In some sense,32Hoc est iudicium in quo vos de reo, populus Romanus de vobis iudicabit.33For evidence that, in fact, most orations were written afterdelivery (except forsuch key sections as the exordium), see Cic. Brut. 91; Tusc. 4.55; Quint. 10.7.30–31.34The Brutus provides extensive evidence of the speeches extant in Cicero’s day,90 MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"therefore, the work constitutes a new genre, hovering somewherebetween epideictic (i.e., literary or ceremonial oratory) and forensicoratory.35It is similar to certain literary orations, such as those ofIsocrates, in its creation of the illusion of an original speech act thatnever occurred, but dissimilar to such works of pure epideictic byits intimate relationship to an earlier, albeit incomplete, forensic per-formance—a relationship that, as we shall see, Cicero allows to deter-mine much of the speech’s form and content.Why would Cicero have chosen to take the unusual course ofwriting and publishing this speech? We have already noted that theopportunities for a novus homoto win the public attention and popular-ity that would allow him to ascend the cursus honorumwere not asgreat as those available to the nobility. At the end of the fifth partof the Second Action, Cicero states that the glory a noble attains‘easily and carelessly’ (II.5.181: per ludum et per neglegentiam) the newman achieves only through extraordinary virtus, industria, and laborand with the added cost of the hostility and envy of his noble competi-tors. By publishing the Verrines, Cicero was able to create a monu-mentumof the enormous effort that had gone into the prosecution ofVerres: his rapid and thorough gathering of evidence in Rome andSicily; his clever outwitting of the strategic moves of the defendant,his counsel Hortensius, and their powerful supporters; his marshallingof a mountain of evidence and a crowd of witnesses in the ActioPrima in such a way as to make Verres’ guilt obvious and force hisdeparture; his ultimate victory over Verres and his supplanting ofHortensius as Rome’s foremost orator. Just as important, the publishedcorpus, especially of the Actio Secunda, would become a monumentumof Cicero’s rhetorical ability in constructing a speech out of thisextensive and complex material that was at once brilliant in inventio,in dispositio, and in elocutio, tying together thematically and factuallyall aspects of the prosecution. Here, then, would be a ‘public work’while Tacitus’ Dialogus (e.g. 12.5) is evidence for speeches extant at a later date.On publication by other orators, see also Quint 10.1.115; Cic. De Or. 1.154.35The term epideictic has different meanings for different rhetorical theorists.See remarks of G. Kennedy, A New History of Classical Rhetoric (Princeton, NJ: PrincetonUniversity Press 1994): 61–62: ‘Modern rhetoricians usually prefer to think of epi-deictic rhetoric as a discourse in any literary genre that is not specifically deliber-ative or judicial and does not, therefore, urge specific action but serves to encouragebelief, group solidarity, and acceptance of a system of values.’’  91MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 91"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"which for Cicero, now aedile-elect, might stand as a source of pub-lic renown and self promotion as memorable as the games, build-ing projects, and festivals he would oversee in his aedilician year.36In constructing this monumentum, Cicero might well have chosen towrite and publish a speech purporting to represent the Second Action,but focused to a much greater degree on pleasing his readers andto a much lesser degree on verisimilitude. He might, for instance,have simply indicated by title the contents of certain parts of thework, especially some of those sections dealing with Verres’ wrong-doings in collecting and purchasing Sicilian grain, as he had donein the published version of other speeches;37or he might have dras-tically shortened this material (II.3), which he acknowledges to bethe least interesting part of the Second Action (II.3.10). The factthat he did neither is an indication that he wished his readers tosee the speech as an accurate reflection of what he would have saidhad the trial gone forward. This is, so to speak, the rhetorical barhe has set for himself, even if by doing so he constrained himself todeal with material that both in content and in length would severelytax his readers’ attention.38Given this evident unwillingness to depart radically from the kindof oration that he would have given at the second part of Verres’trial, Cicero faced a major challenge in trying to capture and retainthe interest of his audience over the course of such a long anddetailed factual exposition. Furthermore, he was also faced with thereal difficulty—as he says in the Divinatio in Caecilium (38)— of mak-ing ‘the libidinous, criminal, and cruel things that [Verres] did seemas painful and unjust to [those] men who merely hear of them asthey seemed to those who experienced them’—that is, of engaginghis audience not only intellectually but emotionally. He responds to36See, e.g., E. Narducci, Cicerone e l’eloquenza romana(Rome: Editori Laterza 1997),on Cicero’s publication of his speeches, as well as of his philosophical and rhetor-ical treatises, as part of an educative ‘cultural project.’37See Mur. 57, Cael. 19, Font. 20, for use of titles; Cicero’s statement (Brutus164)that a speech of Crassus’ included such titles; and statement of Pliny Minor (1.20.7)concerning abridgement in Cicero’s speeches.38In Tacitus Dial. 20, Aper wonders who would be willing actually to read thefive volumes of the Verrines. The consensus of scholarly opinion is that the SecondAction is quite unlike a speech that could have been delivered (see discussion in B. Innocenti, “Vivid Description in Cicero,” Rhetorica 12 [1994]: 364 n. 18). Contra,see A.

Manyof these subsections are, in turn, organized by chronology, geogra-phy, or by the impressiveness of the crime described (often begin-ning with a striking example, proceeding through less memorablematerial, and ending with a particularly shocking instance of Verres’criminality). Further, since the Second Action, or even the five partsthereof, was too extensive to adhere to the typical forensic sequenceof exordium, narratio, argumentum, and peroratio, longer sections withineach of the parts just mentioned are often introduced by a smallscale introduction, followed by a narration, and concluded with amini-peroration, the argument or proof being limited, for the mostpart, to references to the corroborating witnesses and documentsintroduced in the Actio Prima.This structural clarity is supported by an elegant prose style, markedby constant variation among the rhythms, sentence lengths, andtropes associated with the simple style (usually employed within thesections giving factual material), those used in grand style passages(usually reserved for the sections of ‘complaint’ or queremoniawhichoften form part of the mini-perorations) and those characterizingother, ‘intermediate’ styles. Here, rhetorical flaws that were morefrequent in the earlier speeches—such as the tendency to overwhelmsubject matter with stylistic ornament, to repeat the same stylisticnote beyond the point of satiety, and to create commonplaces notcompletely integrated into the texture of an oration—have begun tofade from view. Cicero also attempts to relieve the tedium of hiscatalogue of Verres’ wrongdoing by using carefully chosen exemplatostand for entire categories of crime. These exempla, in turn, are castin dramatic narrative form, making liberal use of all those stylisticfeatures that enliven narrative, especially vivid description.3939See Innocenti (1994).’  93MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 93"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The rhetorical challenge Cicero faced in keeping his audienceattentive was intimately connected to that of engaging their emo-tions. And on the latter the success of the Second Action ultimatelydepended, whether we view the work as a hypothetical speech-actaimed at persuading a jury or as a written document aimed ataffecting a reading public. Thus Cicero attempts throughout the workto rouse strong emotions in his audience: pity for Verres’ victims,anger at his cruelty and arrogance, and fear that his actions mightendanger their own security or that of the state.One potential problem in Cicero’s ability to stir an emotionalresponse, however, resided in the fact that Verres was charged withextorting a large number of works of art, and this from SicilianGreeks. Since the Roman stereotype of Greeks involved various neg-ative traits—such as duplicity, superficiality, and luxuriousness—ifCicero had expatiated at length on the defendant’s devotion to var-ious artistic luxury goods it might well have reinforced his audience’snegative stereotypes of the plaintiffs and undermined his ability toinduce them to sympathize with Verres’ victims. Cicero solves thisproblem in the part of the speech dedicated to the subject (II.4) bymining the symbolic associations of the objects extorted by Verres.In particular, statues of deities that had been stolen from individu-als and towns by Verres become implicit proof of the Sicilians’ reli-gioand the defendant’s disdain of the gods.40Another strategy Cicero used to engage the emotions of the audi-ence on the side of the plaintiffs was by highlighting Verres’ crimesagainst the most vulnerable of victims, a legal ploy with a longRoman history.41To cite but a few examples: The catalogue ofVerres’ crimes during his term as legate in Asia culminates in thetale of the attempted rape of a virginal young girl in Lampsacus(Verr.II.1.63–85). The story is similar to the Roman legend of theattempted rape of Verginia by Appius Claudius during his tyranni-cal exercise of the Decemvirate of 450 B.C.; but in Cicero’s story,the villain Verres remains unpunished for his crime, and the noblefather and brother of the Lampsacan girl are executed for trying to40Cf. discussion of several such narratives in Vasaly (1993): 104–28.41Cf.

Similarly, Verres’ misconduct as praetor urbanusin 74 isillustrated by his defrauding of a child, young P. Iunius (II.1.129–154).This complicated tale turned on the duty inherited by Iunius’ guardiansafter the death of the boy’s father to keep the Forum Temple ofCastor and Pollux in good repair, and Cicero’s account is enlivenedby his verbal recollection of the testimony in the First Action of thenow impoverished child (II.1.152). This appearance had evoked tears,according to Cicero, from the speaker himself, from the audience,and even from Hortensius! Again, Verres’ depredations against Sicilianfarmers are exemplified by the account of an old man of nearlyninety, a Roman eques named Q. Lollius, who was humiliated andbeaten by Verres’ henchman Apronius for refusing to give in to thelatter’s extortionate demands (II.3.61–63). And the account of Verres’dereliction of duty as military commander-in-chief in allowing theSicilian fleet to be burned by pirates builds to the pathetic tale ofthe imprisonment and execution of a number of gallant young Siciliancaptains whom Verres had made his scapegoats for the disaster, inwhich Cicero expatiates on the misery and grief of the men’s agedparents, who must bribe Verres’ henchmen even to bury their sons(II.5.106–110, 117–120, 128–130).While these stories would have had their effect, and despite thefact that the quaestio de repetundiswas instituted for non-Romans toseek redress against their Roman governors, Cicero knew that aRoman audience would have more sympathy for wrongdoings doneto Roman citizens than to provincials. The orator is careful, there-fore, to note any mistreatment by Verres of citizens—and even for-tunate enough to be able to point to a case in which Verres hadabused a Roman senator (II.3.93–98). The most egregious instanceof such mistreatment is dealt with extensively, in an emotionally-charged style, and saved for the very end of the Second Action.In II.5.158–170 Cicero begins the story of P. Gavius, a Romancitizen who had been executed in Sicily under Verres. The intro-ductory passages separate the narrative from what precedes it by theorator’s statement that he was unsure that he possessed the orator-ical resources to equal his subject matter and the sorrow the crimeprovoked in his heart. He then speaks of the incredulity he felt whenhe first was told of Gavius’ story and voices his concern that, afterspeaking of so many outrages, no power of language could be equalto describing so horrible an event. His solution, he says, will be toeschew eloquentiaand let the unadorned facts speak for themselves.’  95MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 95"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"There follows a narratioof Gavius’ encounter with Verrine justice:his imprisonment and subsequent release from the Stone Quarriesat Syracuse; his complaints against Verres, naively voiced whilepreparing to cross from Messana to Italy; his arrest by Verres’Messanan allies in crime, just as the Roman equeswas about to boardship for Italy; Verres’ enraged appearance in the Messanan Forumand his accusation of Gavius as a spy working for the fugitive rebelsof Sertorius; and, finally, the beating, torture, and crucifixion ofGavius, despite his pathetic and oft-repeated cry, ‘Civis Romanus sum.’A short partitiothen follows in which Cicero recalls the volatilityof these events when they had been revealed by witnesses in theActio Prima. Here, Cicero discloses how he had refused to exploit the emotional capital of the story at that time, in spite of which thechief officer of the court, Glabrio, had found it prudent to suspendtestimony concerning the crime, fearing a popular riot. The argu-mentumbegins in section 164 and makes reference to witnesses anddocuments, as well as to Verres’ own earlier admission that Gaviushad claimed to be a Roman citizen. This discussion forms the bridgeto a peroration not only of the specific account of the crime againstGavius but of the entire Second Action.The passages dealing with Gavius constitute a distillation of Cicero’sstrategic handling of much of the most carefully elaborated and emo-tionally potent material of the Second Action. A dramatic narrativedealing with particular circumstances builds to an attempt to rousethe emotions of the audience through a highly charged assertion ofthe wide implications of the events retold. Here, Verres’ refusal toacknowledge Gavius’ claim of citizenship is presented as an attackon Roman security, since it is the guarantee that citizenship meanssomething, not only at home, but also in the provinces and even inextra-Roman territory, that allows citizens to travel in safety through-out the Mediterranean world. Ultimately, Verres’ actions are said tostrike at the very heart of the legal status attendant on citizenship:the execution of Gavius is thus presented as an attack on the free-dom and civil rights of every Roman citizen.In like fashion, the stylistic treatment of these passages is typicalof Ciceronian prose throughout the speech. The narrative sectionsare simply but strongly worded, fulfilling Cicero’s promise, at leastin this section, to let the straightforward revelation of events ‘inflamehis audience’s minds’ (II.5.159). The beginning of the partitio(163)is signaled by a marked change to a grander style, using exclama-96 MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 96"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"tion (O nomen dulce libertatis!), rhetorical question (Hucine tandem haecomnia reciderunt, ut civis Romanus in provincia populi Romani, in oppido foede-ratorum, ab eo qui beneficio populi Romani fascis et securis haberet deligatus inforo virgis caederetur?), and highly charged direct address to the defen-dant (In crucem tu agere ausus es quemquam qui se civem Romanum essediceret?). The peroration builds through carefully wrought periodicsentences to an emotional crescendo making use of a kind of apo-ria, in which Cicero confesses that he is at a loss to describe thecruelty which induced Verres to execute an innocent Roman citi-zen. Here the orator speaks in Verres’ own voice to express the finalcommand that Gavius be crucified within view of the straits thatseparated Sicily from the mainland, and he goes on to push metaphor-ical speech to its limits by asserting that it was not Gavius who hadbeen crucified but the shared Roman principle of freedom and cit-izenship. The lines marking the transition from the Gavius story tothe more general peroration is perhaps the best illustration of Cicero’suse of the ‘grand style’ in the Verrines: periodic, complex, and—inpassages such as this—so highly ornamented and patently emotionalas to border on the poetic (II.5.171):si haec non ad civis Romanosnon ad aliquos amicos nostrae civitatisnon ad eos qui populi Romani nomen audissentdenique si non ad homines verum ad bestiasaut etiam, ut longius progrediar,si in aliqua desertissima solitudinead saxa et ad scopuloshaec conqueri ac deplorare vellemtamen omnia muta atque inanimatanta et tam indigna rerum acerbitatecommoverentur.If it were not to Roman citizens, not to those who are friends of ourstate, not to those who have heard the name of the Roman people;if, in fact, it were not even to human beings at all but to beasts, oreven, to go further, if I were to choose to deplore and bewail theseevents in some deserted wasteland to the rocks and cliffs; even so, allthe mute and lifeless objects, hearing of such great and such unjustcruelty, would yet be moved.While the younger Cicero might have been capable of crafting sucha period, only the more mature orator of the Verrines was capableof laying the formal and notional groundwork that prepared an’  97MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 97"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"audience to admire the high artistic beauty of the passage whilebeing swept along by its equally elevated emotional content.6.Crafting a Public ImageWe have already observed that Cicero made use even of his earli-est speeches to appear as more than simply an advocate speakingin defense of a particular client. Publishing the Verrines, however,offered him a chance to define a public persona in a much moresustained work and before a much wider audience than in those ear-lier speeches. His first consideration in crafting this image had to dowith the fact that, for once, he was speaking for the prosecutionrather than the defense. Ambitious younger men were often eagerto prosecute, for here was the opportunity for a grand gesture: theyoung legal warrior, possessing little influence (gratia) or authority(auctoritas), standing in combat against a powerful ex-magistrate, thelatter hedged round by his crowd of influential supporters and elo-quent advocates.42A victory, or even a noble defeat, in such a con-test would have been close in its popular éclat to distinguishingoneself on a military battlefield.But Cicero was no adulescentulusat this point, but rather a grownman of 36, formerly quaestor and now aedile-elect. He could there-fore expect from Verres’ supporters the sort of personal attack thathe himself would employ in the future when defending returningprovincial governors: accusations that a powerful prosecutor was mis-using his considerable influence in bringing such charges; that theprosecutor was not only cruel but unpatriotic, since the former gov-ernor’s supposed abuses occurred as part of his efforts to preserveRoman prosperity and security in the face of provincial resentment,discontent, and even conspiracy. And Cicero had to fear this sort ofattack even in the aftermath of a trial that had been suspended,since his enemies might claim that he was guilty of marshalling pop-ular discontent with the senatorial class to drive from the state aworthy and innocent public servant before his defense could be fullyheard. Ultimately, if Cicero were to use the speech to craft a posi-42On prosecution, see Quint. 12.7.1–4; Cic. Verr. II.3.3. On the more tangiblerewards of prosecuting a senator, see M. C.

Moreover, headdresses the counter-arguments that might have been used byHortensius to defend his client, thereby appearing to allow the defenseits day in court.43Thus to anyone who might invoke the public sup-port given Verres by the towns of Messana and Syracuse as proofof his innocence, Cicero argues that the former city had been cor-rupted by criminal complicity in Verres’ extortion and that the lat-ter had, in fact, rescinded its support. To the contention that, althoughthe collection of grain might have been burdensome to the Sicilians,it was profitable to the Roman state, Cicero shows that Verres’ deal-ings with Sicilian farmers destroyed the long-term profitability of thatregion as a Roman agricultural resource, comparing Verres to a cor-rupt bailiffwho sells offall the equipment necessary for the runningof an estate and then takes pride in the one-time profit (II.3.119).Verres’ most telling potential defense, however, would have beenthe claim that his actions had been necessary to guarantee the mil-itary security of the province, or merely that, whatever his crimes,the republic could ill afford to dispense with the services of a giftedmilitary man in perilous times.44The worst that the prosecutor hadto fear in such cases was for the defense counsel suddenly to dis-robe his client, revealing the scars that testified to his battlefield hero-ics on Rome’s behalf. Cicero therefore devotes a great deal of time,43For the contention that Hortensius had, in fact, made some sort of speechdefending Verres in the Actio Prima, see M. C. Alexander, “Hortensius’ Speech inDefense of Verres,” Phoenix 30 (1976): 46–53. In addition to the topics I mention,Cicero argues against the contention that Verres was not responsible for the mis-deeds of his friends, associates, and underlings. See discussion in Damon (1997):206–22.44Note Cicero’s explicit references to the possible use of this defense through-out II.5., esp. II.5.2–4, 25, 32–33. The claim seems to have been believed by atleast one Roman historian (see Sallust, Hist., frag. 32 Maur.: C. Verres littora Italiaepropinqua firmavit).’  99MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 99"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"especially in the fifth part of the Second Action, to disputing Verres’claim to military glory in Sicily. He does so by showing: that Verrescould claim no credit for keeping rebellious slaves out of Sicily, sincethere had been no real danger that Spartacus and his followers werelikely to have crossed into the island; that Verres had underminedsecurity by protecting, rather than executing, a captive pirate cap-tain; and that Verres had destroyed the ability of the Sicilian fleetto protect the island by excusing Messana from its obligation toprovide a ship for the fleet, by undermanning the fleet in order tocollect money for exemptions from service, and by placing it underthe command of an incompetent and cowardly Sicilian admiral whilehe himself engaged in debauched revels on the beach at Syracuse.This last, Cicero claims, had directly led to the burning of the fleetby pirates, who then conducted their operations in Sicilian watersunopposed.Also supporting this effort to forestall the possible dangers atten-dant on prosecution is the image Cicero paints of Verres as blood-thirsty, arrogant, and tyrannical. This image is, of course, mainlydrawn by means of the catalogue of brutal crimes described in theSecond Action. But, in addition, the orator makes use of similes andmetaphors particularly resonant within a Sicilian context: Verres isdrawn as a robber, a pirate, a leader of fugitive slaves, and a tyrantlike those Sicilian despots of old, despisers of men and gods, whosenames were watchwords for cruelty.45Not only was such a portraitcalculated to rouse the anger of his audience against Verres andhighlight his guilt, it also served Cicero as a means of self-charac-terization—a way of drawing an ethical contrast between himselfand Verres by demonstrating that it was Verres, not he, who wascruel and merciless.Complementary to these efforts to counteract any negative imageof himself that Verres and his supporters might have promoted dur-ing the trial or even after the defendant’s departure, Cicero createsin the Verrines a carefully considered positive persona for himself.45For Verres as tyrant, see Vasaly, Representations (1993): 117, 212–15; P. Grimal,“Cicéron et les tyrans de Sicile,” Ciceroniana n.s. 4 (1980): 63–74; J. R.

In extended sections placed at the begin-ning and end of the Second Action Cicero locates his motivationfor taking on the case not in his duty to the Sicilians but to theRoman state. As he had in the proem of the First Action, he arguesin these passages that his prosecution of Verres was, first of all, aservice to the senatorial order, which would be allowed to provethat they were capable of convicting a rich but guilty defendant andso vitiate support for the bill, promulgated at the time of the trial,proposing an end to senatorial monopoly of juries. At the same time,Cicero claims in these sections a higher duty to serve the interestsof the Roman people, and as an expression of this duty he declaresthat if the jury were to acquit Verres, he would take the case beforethe tribal assembly.While Cicero may well have intended to make these statementsif the Second Action had actually gone forward, his purpose in includ-ing this material as a major component of the beginning and endof the published speech surely went beyond verisimilitude. Addressedto the reading public, these passages map out a political position forthe newly elected aedile among the individuals and factions thendominating Roman political life. Cicero voices his support of andloyalty to the ‘Sullan dispensation’—that system of senatorial privi-lege left in place by Sulla as a means of shoring up the power ofthe ancestral nobility. But, as in the Pro Roscio, this loyalty is con-ditional: if the continued dishonesty, venality, and corruption of the’  101MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 101"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"judicial system had led to Verres’ acquittal, Cicero wished his audi-ence to know that he would have pursued the case in a trial beforethe people as a function of his perceived duty to the state. Moreover,he makes clear in the Second Action that he identifies this concep-tion of his duty closely with his position as a novus homo—a statusthat allowed him to play the role both of insider and outsider, asenator among senators, but at the same time a critic of the hered-itary senatorial class.46Within the body of the Verrines Cicero less explicitly but just asclearly lays out his own vision of foreign affairs and the ideal oper-ation of Roman imperium in the case of the long-pacified and loyalprovince of Sicily.47By making Verres a symbol of all that had gonewrong in Roman provincial governance, Cicero articulates his con-ception of the correct use of power. And, as befits a topic that isessentially deliberative, this vision is conveyed through notions ofexpediency and honor, the two topics most germane to deliberativerhetoric. Cicero argues, on the one hand, the practical counterpro-ductivity of a provincial regime such as that of Verres in which cru-elty and greed had destroyed Sicilian prosperity, for it was by virtueof this prosperity that both individual Roman land owners and mer-chants, as well as the state as a whole, had formerly been able toreap a profit in Sicily. Furthermore, although he indicates that theSicilians were more likely to abandon their lands than to rebel,Cicero also suggests that provincial exploitation such as that prac-ticed by Verres endangered the security of the state, as it was likelyto lead to military instability and unrest.In dealing with notions related to honor, Cicero paints a pictureof the Roman past as one in which tolerance and generosity hadruled in foreign affairs. It is Cicero’s contention that the maiores hadallowed the allies to become ‘as prosperous as possible,’ such indul-gence to the conquered being seen as a kind of ‘solace for theircondition of slavery’ (II.4.134). In this regard Cicero frequently ad-verts to the Roman conquerors of Sicily—to Marcellus and to Scipio46See Verr. II.5.180–183.47An extensive bibliography exists on Cicero’s attitude towards and writings onthe imperium Romanum. See, e.g., H. Dieter Meyer, Cicero und das Reich(Inaug. Diss.,Köln 1957); P.

While deploring the current pre-cipitous decline from such elevated moral standards, Cicero is alsoat pains to isolate Verres even from the debased standards of thepresent by adducing illustrations of Roman imperial restraint fromhis own time.48Thus the orator undertakes through his accusationof Verres to be seen as endorsing a fidestowards the conquered thatwas at once practically beneficial to the state and firmly based on aRoman concept of honor and justice that he presents as traditional.497.Cicero’s First ‘Political Speech’The Verrines are properly seen as a turning point in Cicero’s career.Behind him were the years of obscurity, of slowly building a namefor himself and creating debts of gratitude by taking on numerousdefense cases, especially of his fellow equites. The Verrines were fol-lowed, probably in 69, by a civil speech, the Pro Caecina, involvinga disputed inheritance and argued on behalf of an Etruscan ofVolaterrae. The town had been a stronghold for the Marians dur-ing the civil war and, after its fall to Sulla in 80, its inhabitants hadbeen stripped of citizenship rights by the dictator. In the course ofthis speech—in which, Cicero later recalled, he was required to‘explain complex issues through definition, praise the civil law, anddraw distinctions between ambiguous words’ (Or. 102)—the oratorargues energetically against the proposition that a citizen could bedisenfranchised and recalls similar arguments he had made, during48For Marcellus’ generosity, see esp. II.2.4; II.4.115–123, 130–131. For Scipio,see esp. II.2.86; II.4.73–83, 97–98. On other Roman conquerors of the past, seeesp. II.1.55. For examples of uprightness among contemporaries, see II.1.56–57;4.133. On the supposed gentleness of past Roman rule in general, see II.5.115:[Siculi] indigne ferunt illam clementiam mansuetudinemque nostri imperii in tantam crudelitateminhumanitatemque esse conversam. (‘The Sicilians take it badly that the kindness and gen-tleness of our rule has been transformed into such great cruelty and inhumanity.’)49Boyancé (1964–65) shows the intimate connection of the ideas of provincialjustice in the Verrines with their expression in the philosophical treatises.

Brunt (1978): 160–1.’  103MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 103"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"the period of Sulla’s domination, on behalf of a woman of anotherEtruscan town, Arretium, which the dictator had punished in simi-lar fashion (Caec. 97).50The Verrines were also followed, predictably but somewhat iron-ically, by the defense of two governors accused of provincial mis-conduct: P. Oppius, quaestor (74) and proquaestor (73) in Bithynia,and M. Fonteius, who had served as governor of Gaul for two yearsin the 70’s. In this and similar cases Cicero must have profited fromthe moral authority he had earned by his success in driving Verresfrom Rome and from the popular appreciation of the political con-tent we have seen in the published version of the speeches, in whichhe had argued forcefully for the just and profitable exercise of Romanimperium. If Cicero, who had arraigned Verres, declared Oppiusand Fonteius innocent of provincial wrongdoing, many would havebeen disposed to believe him, just as the much greater auctoritas hewould later gain by his destruction of Catiline would aid in hisdefense of some, like Caelius Rufus, who were thought to have beencomplicit in the conspiracy.Yet if the Verrines represented an attempt by Cicero to addressa much larger audience than those who attended the original trialand to articulate for that audience a unique vision of foreign pol-icy, the arguments used by the orator in his defense Fonteius—thespeech for Oppius is not extant—must raise the very old questionof Cicero’s ‘sincerity.’ What was the orator’s actual commitment tothe principals expressed in the Verrines if, in works like the ProFonteio, we find him exploiting the supposedly bankrupt topoihe hadattributed to Hortensius? In the Verrines he had scornfully dismissedthe argument that Verres’ military service to the state could excusehis crimes (e.g., Verr. I.5.1–4), but in the Pro Fonteiothe ‘save thisman for the state’ commonplace is vigorously pursued (Font. 41–43).Similarly, the orator’s careful attempt in the Verrines to counteractprejudicial stereotypes of his Sicilian Greek clients gives way in thePro Fonteioto an ethnic attack on the perfidious and untrustworthyGallic accusers of Fonteius (Font. 27–36).50On some of the political and legal issues involved in the Pro muliere Arretina,the Pro Caecina, and the Pro Roscio Amerino, see W. V. Harris, Rome in Etruria andUmbria(London: Oxford University Press 1971): 271–84. A second partially extantcivil case, argued in 69 or in the early 70’s, is the Pro Tullio.

This famous case, in which Cicero claimed to have‘thrown dust in the eyes of the jury’ (Quintil. 2.17.21), was the cul-mination of a series of celebrated trials that had gone on in the pre-ceding eight years, arising out of the charges and counterchargesmade by two prominent families of Larinum, the Cluentii and theOppianici. In 74 Cicero’s client of 66, Aulus Cluentius Habitus, hadaccused an Oppianicus of having attempted to poison him, and thisOppianicus was duly convicted. A number of corruption trials ensued,however, since it was widely believed that the senatorial jury whohad heard Oppianicus’ case had been bribed to convict an innocentdefendant. Cicero’s difficulties in the trial of 66, in which Cluentiuswas now himself accused by Oppianicus’ son of having poisoned hisfather, were heightened by the fact that, before Cluentius embarkedon his accusation of the elder Oppianicus in 74, he had accused afreedman named Scamander of being the agent Oppianicus had usedto carry out the poisoning, and it had been Cicero himself who had(unsuccessfully) defended Scamander.While most of the speech for Cluentius is devoted to counteringthe allegation that the elder Oppianicus had been an innocent manconvicted by a senatorial jury whose votes had been bought andpaid for, a key section contains an explanation of Cicero’s earlierdefense of Scamander. Here (Clu. 51–53) Cicero refers to the dutyof an orator to do as much as he can for his client, calling failurein this duty a sign of treachery or criminal indifference (51: autperfidiae aut neglegentiae). Cicero draws a picture of himself as a ner-vous young advocate who, at the behest of close friends and neigh-bors (49), had dutifully exerted himself to the utmost in a case heknew to be weak. Returning to the issue later in the speech, andalthough claiming that he had earlier been mistaken in his opinionabout the trial of Oppianicus (142), Cicero argues that an advocatemust be allowed to respond to the exigencies of a particular case,and he cautions against interpreting forensic speeches as reflectingan orator’s ‘authentic beliefs’ (139: auctoritates nostras consignatas). Hecites as precedents for this attitude no less authorities than MarcusAntonius, who had never written a speech down so as to be ableto deny having made remarks he later wished to disavow, and LuciusCrassus, who had been forced to listen to an opponent read contra-dictory passages from two deliberative orations (140).

From the time of the Pro Roscio Amerino, Cicerohad begun to be a public man, and for the Roman public manevery public event was to some extent ‘definitional’—a moment inwhich his persona was further elucidated and hisauctoritas enlarged ordiminished. Therefore, even if we resist the temptation to use thespeeches to determine Cicero’s ‘real’ sentiments, a rhetorical analy-sis of the orations demands consideration of their attempted manip-ulation of the multiple audiences to which they were addressed: inthe case of the forensic orations, the jury and the corona, or listen-ing crowd, who were present at the original performance (if such aperformance had, in fact, taken place); in the case of the delibera-tive orations, the assembled senate or populus Romanus; and, in thecase of both, the reading public for whom the published speeches,as Laurand has written, ‘were the pamphlets of their time...func-tioning not simply as models for young people [studying rhetoric]but also acting upon public opinion.’51In 66 Cicero achieved what for many men of his backgroundmight have been the crowning office of a successful magisterial career,election to the praetorship. The position, entailing as it did the grantof imperium, allowed Cicero the opportunity to address the assem-bled populace at a contio. The occasion was the public debate of thelaw proposed by the tribune of the people, C. Manilius, by whichPompey would be given command of a renewed military campaignagainst Mithradates of Pontus. The latter, despite a number of reversessuffered during the campaigns of the previous years, especially thoseby L. Licinius Lucullus, still threatened Roman stability in Asia. Thelaw followed close upon a tribunician law of the previous year, thelex Gabinia, in which a command with extraordinary latitude hadbeen granted to Pompey to fight the pirates, long a threat toMediterranean travel and commerce. Despite the opposition of manyin the senate to this earlier command, Pompey had in the aston-ishingly short period of six months swept the pirates from the sea51Laurand (1936–38): 2: ‘. . . même au temps de leur première publication, ilsexergaient quelquefois une action plus profonde que les discours prononcés: c’étaientles pamphlets du temps, et ils ne devaient pas seulement servir de modèles à lajeunesse, mais aussi agir sur l’opinion.’106 MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 106"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"and now, having wintered in Asia, stood ready for further servicein the East.Cicero wrote later that the speech was written ‘in the temperedstyle’ (Orat. 102: temperata oratione); George Kennedy remarks on its‘great smoothness.’52Both descriptions are accurate. The speech isextremely carefully constructed, marked by extraordinary eleganceof diction and phrasing, but lacking emotional fire and never risingto passages of strong pathos. This was, of course, intentional, asCicero endeavored to support a foreign policy measure proposed bya tribune of the people, enthusiastically embraced by the masses,and opposed by Q. Lutatius Catulus and Hortensius, without appear-ing to play the demagogue and without giving undue offense to sen-atorial conservatives or to Lucullus himself.Predictably, Cicero draws on arguments that deal both with honor(the glory of Rome’s military reputation; its commitments to its allies)and utilitas(the public and private Roman revenues endangered byMithradates and his ally, Tigranes). The heart of the speech, how-ever, is concerned with praise of Pompey. Here Cicero’s treatmentof the qualities essential to the ideal imperator(scientia, virtus, auctoritas,felicitas) reads more like a philosophical treatise illustrating the tech-nique of Aristotelian definition than an oration delivered at a lateRepublican political assembly. Each quality is named and discussed,most notably virtus (29–42), which is subdivided into a variety ofpractical and moral virtues. The importance of the latter is reprisedin sections 64–68, a part of the speech in which we may detectsome real warmth of sentiment. Here Cicero decries the mistreat-ment of allies and praises Pompey’s immunity to the greed and lustcommonly exhibited by Roman commanders and their armies amongsubject peoples. His laudatio Pompeithus carries with it a vision ofthe honorable exercise of military imperium in a theater of war andforms a counterpart to the conception found in the Verrines of thejust exercise of imperial power in a long pacified province. In theearlier speech, however, this political disquisition is carried out throughblame rather than through praise. One of the more noteworthyaspects of such passages in the Pro Lege Manilia is their illustrationof how the rhetoric of praise could be used—as it would be later52Kennedy (1972): 173. For an outline of the rhetorical structure, see PaulMacKendrick, The Speeches of Cicero (London: Duckworth 1995): 3–6.’  107MAY_f5_71-111 7/11/02 8:48 PM Page 107"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"by writers like Seneca and Pliny—as a disguised form of exhorta-tion to the powerful to use power justly.In the Pro Lege Manilia (1), Cicero speaks of the fact that this washis first address to the people from the Rostra—his first speech, thatis, de republica. It is not surprising, therefore, to find the new prae-tor employing the beginning and the end of the work to speak prin-cipally of himself: in the exordium alluding to his feelings of pleasureand humility at having arrived at such a lofty position; and, in theperoration, affirming—even swearing—that his support of Manilius’bill was motivated by high-minded concern for the interests of thestate rather than for any personal gain he hoped to achieve thereby.Moreover, the discussion of provincial mistreatment within the bodyof the speech is calculated to advance an important aspect of Ciceronianpolitical self-presentation, an epideictic section used to shape the pop-ular impression not only of Pompey but of Cicero himself as defenderof provincials.It is also clear, however, that the Pro Lege Manilia was not the firstattempt by Cicero to speak to his listening and reading audience dere publica. As we have seen, each of the preconsular speeches wasconcerned with crafting an image of the orator that would transcendthe moment of the speech. His electoral success was not, therefore,as he claims in the speech (2), owed merely to the legal support hehad given to his friends or to the mastery of his art attained dur-ing his long oratorical tirocinium (apprenticeship). It was owed as wellto the political and ‘ethical’ content of his earlier judicial and evencivil speeches, which had prepared his way to the praetorship andwould, by 64, help to convince the Roman people to raise to theconsulship a novus of non-senatorial family—the first such consulelected in twenty years.BGeneral StudiesClassen, C.

Cape, Jr.Great is the name of consul, great is the appearance of one,great the dignity, and great the majesty.In Pisonem24Cicero’s consulship in 63 B.C. crowned a doggedly ambitious polit-ical career that has become one of the most memorable in Romanhistory. In his year as Rome’s leading magistrate Cicero reconciledfactional strife among the social classes, defeated a threat to theSenate’s power, and rescued the city from a potential political andmilitary coup known as the Catilinarian Conspiracy.1He accom-plished these feats through political rather than military means, bypresenting his arguments openly before the Senate, various juries,and the Roman people. For his success, Cicero was named parenspatriae, granted the corona civica, and a special thanksgiving was votedin his honor, the first ever granted a civilian for non-military action.2Yet Cicero’s fame was not due to the fact that he happened to beconsul in interesting times, but that he thrust himself into the mid-dle of fractious domestic political issues and dared to develop—andto articulate—a social policy. His program of concordia ordinumrequiredthat he ostensibly balance the competing political and economic inter-ests of the Senate, equites, and the populus.3Oratory was the natural1131Nearly all major works about Cicero contain a discussion of his consulship.Most important are E.

Oratory had been the traditional vehiclefor publicly reconciling competing factions at Rome;4speeches them-selves, however, were ephemeral, their arguments subject to the vicis-situdes of memory. As he had done for nearly twenty years, Ciceropublished his speeches to ensure that they—and he—would not beforgotten. But the consular orations present a unique challenge forinterpretation because Cicero was later concerned that they be readnot individually but as a coherent group. In the case of these speeches,Cicero was clearly thinking beyond the level of the individual speechto the potential of a collection that represented him as a seriouspolitician. The selection of a group of speeches to present a coher-ent image of the author as a politician was a unique event.5Historians and literary critics of the past century have generallydismissed the corpusof consular speeches as revised documents designedto help Cicero save his political career in light of the forming coali-tion between Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, and the threats of P. Clodius.6There are two reasons for suspecting revisions: the factthat Cicero does not mention the speeches until he sends them toAtticus in 60, and a deep-seated, eighteenth and nineteenth centurypositivism that led scholars to believe they could detect and correctperceived infelicities in Ciceronian texts and attribute them to cir-cumstances based on historical hindsight.7Moreover, ancient histo-rians since Mommsen, emphasizing Realpolitik, have discounted thespeeches because they are rhetorical and cannot be trusted as sourceMAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 114"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"material. Historians of a prosopographical bent disregard speechesas ineffectual bluster, for real political negotiations were arrangedamong family members and friends behind the scenes, not in pub-lic.8The effect of this disdain has been that the consular speecheshave received scant attention as a coherent group and there hasbeen little effort to understand what Cicero intended his corpustoillustrate.Recent work in Roman history has come to value the importanceof oratory in Roman politics and emphasizes the role of the peoplein Roman government.9Yet the judgments of the past weigh heav-ily on these new interpretations.10The result is that the consularspeeches—especially, if not only, the Catilinarians—are still suspect.The time is ripe, then, for a fresh examination of the consularspeeches in light of this renewed interest in the practical power ofrhetoric and the understood importance of addressing the people inRoman politics.11This chapter will examine Cicero’s consular corpusas a conscious selection of material designed to illustrate his con-sular ethos through examples of practical political negotiation.12Cicero’s Consular S«maIn January of 62, three days after he laid down the consulship,Cicero defended his execution of the Catilinarian conspirators and8Cf.

Remembering what a brilliant show your countrymanDemosthenes made in his so-called Philippicsand how he turned awayfrom this argumentative, forensic type of oratory to appear in the moreelevated role of statesman, I thought it would be a good thing for metoo to have some speeches to my name which might be called ‘Consular.’They are: (1) delivered in the Senate on the Kalends of January; (2)to the Assembly, on the agrarian law; (3) on Otho; (4) in defence ofRabirius; (5) on the children of persons proscribed; (6) delivered whenI publicly resigned my province; (7) when I sent Catiline out of Rome;(8) to the Assembly the day following Catiline’s flight; (9) at a publicmeeting the day the Allobroges turned informers; (10) in the Senatethough the method differs.

(Att. 2.1.3)18Cicero is quite simply replying to Atticus’ request for a few speeches.Although such a request and a few other features of this passage,including the diminutive (oratiunculas) and the notion of supplying rawmaterial, are commonplaces in the dedications of prose works,19Cicero seems to be responding to an actual request in this personalletter, not employing a literary conceit. The comment that Atticusenjoys Cicero’s rhetorical efforts is polite enough, but the real pur-pose of Atticus’ request was for material (isdem ex libris perspicies etquae gesserim et quae dixerim; aut ne poposcisses). Atticus undoubtedly askedCicero to critique his commentarius, which he did,20and, in anticipa-tion of Cicero’s critique and his own planned revisions, to send somespeeches that were unavailable to him in Epirus.Atticus sought specific speeches but Cicero claims they belongtogether with others as a group and implies that they should be readand considered as a unit. The principles of selection are straight-forward: 1) imitation of Demosthenes; 2) not narrowly argued judi-cial speeches; 3) they should make him seem semnÒterÒw tiwetpolitik≈terow. The common denominators are style and appearance:the speeches are concerned with larger issues that a political leadershould handle; they present an image of Cicero as high-mindedstatesman. Representation seems to be foremost in his mind.21The reference to Demosthenes’ Philippicsfollows directly from the‘enthusiasm of my young admirers’ (nos...adulescentulorum studiis exci-tati) which also leads to his comment that he ‘thought it would be18Translation by D.

There is nothing here to suggest a revi-sion of previous speeches. Cicero is engaged in literary imitation.Demosthenes’ Philippicswere noted for their frankness and theirattempt to persuade the Athenians to do what was honorable ratherthan consider what was easiest or most pleasurable, or profitable.22Demosthenes rises above petty arguments to focus the people’s thoughtson larger issues.23The Philippicsportray a great statesmen rallyinghis fellow citizens to action against as yet unperceived threats to theirliberty. This is the situation and characterization that Cicero wantshis readers to have in mind.24In selecting speeches that portray him as suitable consul, Cicerorejects the style of his judicial orations as too ‘argumentative,’25thoughhe includes Pro Rabirio Perduellionis Reo, which is technically a defensespeech. Of the two defenses we know Cicero delivered in 63 butdid not include in his consular corpus, Pro Murenawas published andsurvives; Pro C. Calpurnio Pisonemay or may not have been published,but does not survive.26Why Cicero chose to include Pro Rabiriorather22Plutarch, Dem. 12.7, 13.5–6.23Dionysius Halicarnassus, Dem. 21–22.24There is also a possible similarity based on the number of speeches, given thefour Philippics, four De Lege Agraria, and four Catilinarians. Yet, there does not seemto have been a set corpusof Demosthenes’ speeches in antiquity, save for groups ofspeeches in general categories, such as the Philippics; M. W. Haslam, “A Problemin the History of the Transmission of Texts Exemplified in Demosthenes,” LiverpoolClassical Monthly1 (1976): 9–10; cf. the comments of W. Stroh and M. Winterbottomin Éloquence et rhétorique chez Cicéron, edited by W. Ludwig, Entretiens sur l’AntiquitéClassique, Vol. 28 (Vandœuvres-Genève: Fondation Hardt 1982): 38–9, 229. If thereis a principle of four speeches as a unit, it may account for why one of Cicero’sCatilinariansand the Pro Murenawere not included, since they would disturb thecoherence of the group, but the splitting of De Lege Agrariainto two speeches andtwo fragments seems to argue against this.For an extended comparison based on imitation of passages, see A. Weische,Ciceros Nachamung der attischen Redner(Heidelberg: Carl Winter 1972): 65–8 and 166–94.For arguments that Cicero’s style was not yet markedly Demosthenic, see C. W.Wooten, Cicero’s Philippicsand their Demosthenic Model(Chapel Hill: University ofNorth Carolina Press 1983), esp. 46–57. The comparison would be recognizableonly for the reader of the collected speeches, as in the Philippics; see the discussionof Classen and Stroh in Éloquence et Rhétorique(1982): 35–6, and Winterbottom andStroh, 38–9.25The precise meaning of refractariolois uncertain; see D.

It has recently been argued thatthe speech embodies a political prudence that is accommodating,decorous, and moderate, and suits Cicero’s political practice.28Wecan only conjecture the reasons Pro Murenawas not included in theconsular corpus, but it seems clear that they were somehow aes-thetic.29There were also four political speeches on narrow topics weknow Cicero delivered in 63 that he probably did not publish, muchless include among his consular speeches.30Cicero’s selection of a few of his own speeches as a coherent andaesthetic unit is the first evidence we have for such a phenomenonin antiquity.31Keeping with his interest in literary imitation, he usesthe Greek word s«mato describe the collection: hoc totum s«macurabout habeas. S«maseems to have been used rarely of a collection ofwritings,32sÊntajiwbeing more appropriate for items arranged inchronological order.33When s«mawas used in reference to litera-ture before Cicero’s day it signified an organic unity.34Cicero may27M.

Leff, “Cicero’s Pro Murenaand the Strong Case for Rhetoric,” Rhetoric &Public Affairs1 (1998): 61–88.29The two reasons that appear paramount are 1) the sections of Pro Murenapok-ing fun at Cato (60–66) lack sufficient gravitas when compared to other speeches,and 2) the attack on Servius Sulpicius (35–53, esp. 38) diminishes the emphasisCicero places on the importance of the orator and of his consular voxin theCatilinarians. I owe this last point to a discussion with Professor W. Stroh and thankhim for permission to mention it here.30Crawford (1984): 85–91.31McDermott (1972). The Verrinesdiffer in that the speeches belong to the samecourt case, though Cicero’s publication of the entire set of speeches (he would havegiven) seems to have been a first. Cicero was clearly approaching the collection anddissemination of orations in a new way.32LSJ, s.v. “s«ma” iv, lists only ad Att. 2.1.3. To this should be added the scol-ium on the Iliad(Eust. 5.33–6) mentioned by M.

Hehas collected them into an aesthetically pleasing s«mawith a viewto literary imitation, calculated to appeal to young men whose ambi-tion required Greek learning. There is no evidence that Cicero revisedthe speeches and sent newer versions to Atticus merely to curry favorwith those in power.37When Atticus requested material to revise hiswork on Cicero’s consulship, he erred by asking Cicero for only acouple of the speeches. Cicero replied that the group of orationsbelonged together and indicated why.Seven of the ten consular speeches and one of the ‘fragments’ sur-vive whole or in part; enough to gain a fair impression of the con-sular image Cicero wished to convey. Each speech addresses itsparticular issue in detail and can be shown to take full advantageof the physical context of its delivery (‘what I did and what I said’).Yet the speeches also work together to construct an ethos for Cicerothe serious politician who serves selflessly the interests of Rome andrallies the Senate and Roman people to work for the good of theres publica. Although the general outline of Cicero’s consular personais well known, the consular speeches have not been examined as acollection that both constructs this persona and appeals to the rhetor-ically (and politically) minded youth who pressure Cicero to writeout his speeches. The remainder of this chapter will sketch someways the speeches accomplish the task.38matter of Herodotus and Thucydides, ad Pomp. 3.

Servilius Rullus. Agrarian legislation had a long and contentioushistory at Rome, enabled by the special importance of public land(ager publicus) in Roman foreign and domestic policy.39Territory mightbecome public land when conquered in the name of Rome; suchterritory might then be offered to Roman citizens to settle. Publicland could be assigned or sold to individuals to farm or graze, andcertain rights could become hereditary, but revenue from such landwas owed to the state treasury. Complete ownership remained withRome. When rich men acquired large tracts of public land theybegan to consider it private property and diminished or discontin-ued their revenue payments. Redistributions of public land usuallymeant taking land from the large landholders and reassigning it topoorer citizens, who would have an opportunity to earn a living andalso contribute to the state treasury. Redistribution efforts were oftenled by men who looked to the masses for political support; they wereopposed by wealthy landowners, senators being in that rank.Rullus’ bill may have been offered in the spirit of true reform andwith general good intent, but it is impossible to know for certain onthe basis of Cicero’s attacks.40Rullus seems to have opened the doorstudies. The following sketch will outline only those features of the speeches thatare useful for the construction of Cicero’s consular ethos, leaving aside most polemicabout historical details. A great deal of scholarly literature on Ciceronian oratoryis concerned with the perceived ‘sincerity’ of Cicero’s arguments; such conjecturesare of little use for rhetorical criticism and may be left aside when considering howthe speeches represent Cicero. This is not to adopt a naïve approach to Ciceroand believe everything he says; it is to look at the rhetorical effect of what he sayswhether truthful or not.

He proposed to establish aboard of ten commissioners (decemviri) with extensive and unprece-dented powers to buy, sell, confiscate, or give away public land. Thedecemvirs were to be elected in an unusual way, from a majorityout of only 17 of the 35 voting tribes, and the people’s favorite,Pompey, was excluded from membership. Thus it appeared that thedecemvirs might not represent the people’s interests. Indeed, withthe extensive and arbitrary powers granted them, Cicero points outtheir similarity to the dictator Sulla, the enemy of the people. Thelaw would allow the decemvirs to establish colonies and fill themwith citizens of their choice, which Cicero paints as a possible mil-itary threat to Rome.Cicero claimed that the bill that was ostensibly ‘popular’ was inreality a brutal abrogation of power by ten men who were not electedby the people and would not serve their or the Senate’s interests.In De Lege AgrariaI Cicero makes his argument to the Senate in hisfirst major act as consul. Others have dealt with the particulars ofthe bill and Cicero’s arguments.41Here, we are concerned with theimage of Cicero in the speech and how it is ‘consular’ in repre-senting what he said and did.The exordiumof De Lege AgrariaI is lost, regrettably, for it likelycontained important information about how Cicero wished to beperceived by the senators, comments on his homo novusstatus vis-à-visthe senatorial nobility, and additional remarks on the nature of hisconsulship. As it stands, the speech opens somewhere in the middleof his argument with a characterization of Rullus and the decemvirias drunkards and gluttons, ravenously consuming all public landsthey can, squandering the state’s assets as they have their own, anddishonoring the dignitasof the Roman people (1–2). Cicero claimsthey will sell some of the best land in Italy (3–4), the choicest landin the provinces won for Rome decades earlier by the noble gener-als, and even lands won by Pompey (5–6). They will have unlim-ited powers beyond those of even the censors and other magistrates41Scholarship focuses on the second speech, though comparisons with the firstare frequently made: C. J.

He claims to be a consul popularis—a true popularis,supporting what the people want: pax, concordia, and otium—and chal-lenges Rullus to debate the matter openly in a meeting before thepeople (23).42He characterizes the current state of Rome and therebydemonstrates the need for his policies:You [Rullus and the tribunes] have handed me a state anxious withsuspicion, hesitant from fear, alarmed by your laws, meetings, and set-tlements of colonists; you hold out hope to the wicked, cause the goodto fear, and have cast trust from the forum, respect from the repub-lic. In this turbulence and confusion of citizens’ minds and affairs,when the voice and authority of the consul (vox et auctoritas consulis) willsuddenly shine upon the Roman people amid such darkness, when itshows that there is nothing to fear, no army, no armed gang, nocolonies, no auction of revenues, no new empire, no decemviral king-dom, no second Rome or other seat of empire will exist with us asconsuls, and that there will be general tranquility based on peace andleisure; then, I imagine, we will need to fear that that admirable lawof yours seems too popular. (23–24)Cicero rejects the honors derived from personal ambition to swayhim from his course, though it be unpopular, and vows not to takea province so he will not owe anyone a political debt or seem toincur political obligations (25). Finally, addressing the tribunes heencourages them to turn from their designs and help him rid thecity of the internal enemies that wound it, so they may heal ittogether and Cicero will be seen to restore the old-time auctoritasofthe Senate (26–27).42For the political vocabulary used throughout the speeches, see J.

The main issue to emergeis that Cicero works for concordia, paxand otium(21, 23–4), the goalsof a politician who is truly popularis(23). Cicero would later claimthat concordia ordinumor consensio bonorum omniumwas his policy.43Hisopponents are those who stir up dissention among the people andthe allies (2–3, 6, 8–11, 15–27), though they claim to be friends ofthe people (23). Cicero supports principles dear to the people and theSenate, linking key political watchwords such as libertas, dignitasandauctoritas(17, 22–3, 27). He claims he will open up politics, bring-ing negotiations into the light of day (5, 24), using the assembliesand his oratory (23–4, 27), whereas his enemies prefer to work insecret and in the dark (1, 3, 7, 11, 26). Cicero’s use of oratory, theassemblies, and negotiations before the people suits the current sit-uation, for Rome is not threatened by some external king or nation,but by an internal foe (26). As will become obvious throughout thecourse of the consular speeches, this foe cannot be adequately defeatedby military means alone: it must be combated by exposing it, mak-ing clear its designs against Rome, and rousing up all Romans againstit. To do this, and to unify the Roman people against this threat,requires not a general, but an orator.Accommodation of competing factions is one of the quintessentialfunctions of oratory.44At the end of the speech, Cicero offers tobridge the gap between traditionally popular and conservative concernsby encouraging the tribunes to work with him and the Senate, empha-sizing collegiality (colligite vos,...conspirate nobiscum, consentite cumbonis, communemrem publicam communistudio atque amore defendite,26). For those who wish to gain power by causing trouble in thestate (thus, revealing Cicero’s distinctly senatorial view of traditionalpopularispractices), Cicero offers his own career as an example ofthe working together of competing factions and the success that canbe obtained: ‘let him take me myself as his example, whom he seesrisen from an equestrian rank to become consul, and my way of lifethat leads good men so easily to high office and respect’ (27).43H.

It also establishes his con-sular ethos: moderate but principled, firm yet willing to work withothers, reasoned, committed to conducting politics in the open, self-sacrificing, and tireless in the pursuit of concordia. And yet, the speechis only a partial statement, half the inaugural, for it was deliveredto the Senate. Although Cicero takes a bold step by declaring him-self a popularisin the Senate, not an easy thing to do as he says tothe people in his second speech (2.6), he is still speaking before onlyone of the ordineshe wants to bring together. The reader naturallyanticipates reading Cicero’s argument before the people in De LegeAgrariaII.De Lege AgrariaII survives virtually intact and most likely parallelsthe first speech in its general tripartite structure. As before, theexordium(1–16) and peroratio(98–103) contribute most to craftingCicero’s consular image. The bulk of the speech is a detailed, seem-ingly chapter-by-chapter analysis of Rullus’ legislation where Ciceroexplains the implications of the bill’s provisions (16–97). The mainarticles concern the election of the decemviriby only 17 of the 35tribes (16–30), description of their excessive powers (31–35), theiruncontrolled use of enormous sums of money (35–72), and theirunregulated power to allot land wherever they wish, especially inCampania, planting colonies that may grow to threaten Rome (73–97).The details are overwhelming and give the appearance that Ciceroknows the bill thoroughly and understands fully the implications ofpassing it.45We need not believe all Cicero’s arguments or the impli-cations he finds in the bill’s provisions, but it must be said that hisextensive treatment of the proposed law contributes to his image asa diligent and informed consul.In the exordiumCicero establishes a bond between himself and thepeople and outlines the reciprocal obligations they have with oneanother. One wonders whether he did the same with the Senate inthe first speech. He opens by acknowledging the conventions of amagistrate’s first speech to the people, expressions of gratitude andpraise of one’s ancestors, but says he must break with tradition45Cf.

He stresses his status as a homo novus, the first in decades,and the outstanding honor of his election at the earliest possibletime, suo anno, creating a stronger obligation to work for the peoplewho supported him (3–5). He apologizes for speaking about himself,but is in a dilemma: ‘I fear that to speak about myself among youwould be considered arrogant, but to remain silent would seemungrateful’ (2). He thus justifies his speech and vows not to remainsilent, preparing the way for him to use oratory as his vehicle forpolitical negotiations with the people (6). He will use ‘reason and amoderate style of speaking’ (certa ratio et moderatio dicendi) which char-acterizes not only his speech, but his policies and his consular per-sona (2). Emphasizing his debt to the people elicits their good willand sympathy toward him when he speaks of needing to protect theconsulship (tuendi consulatus) and of knowing that he has no alliesamong the nobilesif he should fail (5). Cicero strengthens these feel-ings by expressing his willingness to endure the danger alone andhis concerns that ‘certain men’ might blame the people for havingelected him (6).Cicero has tried to put his audience into a psychological state inwhich they support him because he has acknowledged their impor-tance, his debt to them, the similarity of their status insofar as heis not nobilis, his desire to work for them, and his willingness tosacrifice himself for their cause and the good of the state. The con-junction of interests seems natural. At this point he announces hewill conduct his consulship in a new way, by frequently bringingpolitical debate to the people and speaking in the assemblies. Healso declares that he will be a popularis consul(6). One can only imag-ine the audience reaction. Demagogic rhetoric or not, it makes anarguably good case for shared interests between Cicero and theRoman populus. His image as a friend of the people is strengthenedby his request for their help in defining the word popularis, sayinghe has need of their sapientia(7). Dilating on topics dear to the peo-ple, especially pax, libertas, and otium(7–9), he asks ‘how could I notbe popularis?’ (9).The development of Cicero’s ethos in the exordiumhas put him ina position to challenge Rullus and the other tribunes, who would126 . ,.MAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 126"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"be expected to be popularesby virtue of their office (10–16). Havingemphasized his connections with the people, Cicero points out thatsince Rullus entered office he has become distanced, affecting adifferent style of dress, speech, and comportment, looking like a men-ace to the state (13). Cicero is at pains to demonstrate that thereneed be no enmity between consuls and tribunes though there hasoften been in the past (14). It is not that their potestasis incompat-ible, but only an animorum disiunctio(14). And so, having establishedhis populariscredentials, and in an effort to work together with thetribunes, he takes up Rullus’ proposed legislation (15).The peroration of De Lege AgrariaII works like that of the firstspeech: it does not so much argue for or craft Cicero’s image as itconfirms it based on what he has said. Cicero recalls his exceptionalhonors and the burden they place on him when he expresses sur-prise that Rullus would try to harm the state while he is consul:‘For although the hard work and attention to protecting the repub-lic is a weighty task for all consuls, it is especially so for those whowere not made consuls in their cradles, but in the campus’ (100).His lack of noble ancestors requires him to rely on himself. As aresult, he must define himself before the people: ‘I promise this toyou, Romans, in good faith: you have entrusted the republic to aman who is vigilant, not afraid, hardworking, not lazy. Am I thesort of consul who fears an assembly, who trembles before a tribuneof the plebs, who often creates disturbances for no reason, who isfrightened that I must live in prison if the tribune of the plebs ordersthat I be brought there?’ (100–101). He also articulates his princi-ples and policy: ‘I understand, Romans, that nothing can be so pop-ularisas that which I bring into this year for you as a consul popularis:peace, tranquility, leisure (pax, tranquilitas, otium). Through my judg-ment and reason I foresaw the things you feared while I was con-sul elect so they will not be able to take place’ (102).At the end of the speech Cicero rallies the people: ‘The greatestand most powerful protection for our common interests, Romans, isthat you show yourselves in all future times of strife in the republicas the kind of men you have showed me you are today this greatassembly, working for your own welfare’ (103). Not only does thisparallel Demosthenes’ appeals to the Athenian citizens; it documentsthe fact that Cicero and the people are working together in har-mony, that they share the same concerns.’  127MAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 127"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"46J.

Although the exordiumfor De Lege AgrariaI does not survive,it most likely emphasized Cicero’s common bonds with the senatorsand his willingness to promote their interests. The general structureof the speech was probably similar to De Lege AgrariaII, though thepolitical stance may have been different. Simply opposing agrarianlegislation may have been enough to indicate his support of theSenate. Yet it would be wrong to characterize the speeches as sim-ply toadying to their respective audiences, for Cicero also makesarguments that run counter to his audiences’ traditional interests. Inthe speech to the Senate he declares himself a popularis consulwhowill work for the things the people love most (1.23); in the speechto the people he opposes legislation that was traditionally favorableto them (2.10). It is a distinctive feature pervasive in Cicero’s ora-tory that he crosses such boundaries and builds his argument uponsome paradox of fundamental beliefs. Years after his consulship hecould claim, ‘And so I carried out my consulship in such a way thatI did nothing without the advice of the Senate and nothing withoutthe approval of the Roman people, that I defended senatorial inter-ests on the rostra and popular interests in the Senate, and that Iconjoined (coniunxerim) the masses with the leaders and the equestrianorder with the Senate’ (Pis. 7).Cicero delivered two more speeches on the agrarian law, butincluded them only as ‘fragments’ when he sent his consular corpusto Atticus (Att. 2.1.3). The main argument of one (we do not knowwhich) survives, perhaps all that Cicero preserved. It is almost com-pletely argument, however, lacking the extended comments aboutCicero or his policies that he included in the exordiumand peroratioof the previous speeches. This may explain why it was listed last,after the full speeches: it provides important information but doesnot contribute anything new to Cicero’s consular image.The third speech of the consular corpus is Cicero’s defense of L. Roscius Otho. One fragment and some testimonia survive.46Theoccasion for the speech was that the people hissed Otho as he enteredMAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 128"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"a theater because he had passed a law assigning the fourteen rowsbehind the senators to the equites. The people were outraged at thisprivilege and reviled Otho, while the equites rallied to support him.Cicero called the people to the temple of Bellona and upbraidedthem, whereupon they returned to the theater and applauded Otho.The main function of the speech seems to have been to preserveequestrian dignitas. As the third speech it also defended the interestsof the third ordoof Cicero’s program of concordia ordinum, makingcommon cause with other members of his own class and encourag-ing the people to accept class distinctions in the theater. Thus, inthe first three speeches, Cicero aligns himself with the Senate, thepeople, and the equites, promoting their common interests in venuesassumed to be hostile to the other groups.The Consular CounselCicero’s speech on behalf of Gaius Rabirius, delivered later in theyear, furnished a grand opportunity to demonstrate his ability totranscend the niggling arguments of the legal advocate and use hisoratory in the service of the state. Details of the trial are compli-cated and obscure, but scholars generally agree on the outline.47Sometime before the elections for 62, the aged senator Rabirius wasindicted for a murder committed thirty seven years earlier. The pros-ecutor was a popularistribune, Titus Labienus, who worked closelywith Julius Caesar in 63 to curb senatorial power. Together theydredged up an archaic procedure for trying, sentencing, and pun-ishing the culprit before the populus, and the charge was the almostforgotten accusation of perduellio, high treason. The victim had beenthe revolutionary popular tribune Lucius Saturninus, which madethe trial rather sensational. But the ultimate cause of Saturninus’death made the trial politically important, for he had been killed onthe basis of a decree by the Senate, the so-called ‘Final Decree,’ thesenatus consultum ultimum(SCU).48The SCU indicated that a state of47For discussion, see W.

In both cases, the men were killed without a trial, whichran counter to Roman law. In both cases, the men charged withkilling them were exonerated by the Senate. To the Senate, the SCUgave it the power—never uncontested, but power nevertheless—tosuppress an armed uprising in the city, where recourse to a stand-ing army was impossible. To the popular leaders, the SCU repre-sented an unconstitutional abrogation of power that limited the civilrights of Roman citizens. Since a direct assault on the SCU itselfwas impossible, the tribune Labienus found another path: his unclehad been killed with Saturninus, which provided an ostensible per-sonal motive, and the aged Rabirius made a perfect target, for hewas known to have attended dinner parties, carrying Saturninus’head on a spear as a kind of joke.49In the case against Rabirius there seem to have been two trials:the first under the archaic procedure which led to a summary ver-dict given by Caesar, who presided over the court with his relative,the consul of 64, Lucius Caesar; and the second, where Rabiriusappealed his conviction to the Roman people who, in the form ofthe centuriate assembly, sat as the jury for the trial. The ancientpenalty for perduelliowas crucifixion in the campus Martius, a cruelpunishment which carried an enormous emotional charge for theRomans, for it was not only a painful and shameful death, but itwould have symbolically deprived Rabirius of his Roman citizenshipand status as a free man, disgracing him and his family for gener-ations. Cicero and the Senate opposed the first trial, but were appar-ently unable to halt it completely. The speech Cicero delivered forRabirius was given at the second trial, where the penalty was onlya fine, though perhaps one large enough to force Rabirius into exilebecause he would be unable to pay.The archaic proceedings invoked by Labienus and Caesar suggesta serious effort to counter the forty or more years of general accep-tance of the SCU by appealing to the greater authority of an evendevelopment of the SCU, see J. von Ungern-Sternberg, Untersuchungen zum spätre-publikanischen Notstandrecht.

Thus, it provides Cicero an oppor-tunity to appear before the people as something more than a defenselawyer for an individual: his status as consul demands that he defendthe state (2). Yet his brief is not so straightforward, for he cannotsimply defend the SCU and the authority of the Senate (auctoritassenatus); he must combine it with support for the libertasof the Romanpeople. In so doing, he develops themes he put forward in De LegeAgrariaand fashions a distinctive approach to the relationship betweenlibertasand auctoritas.51Since Cicero takes great pains to transform a defense speech intoa political oration and construct a consular ethos that rises abovethat of a defense advocate in a private case, it will be useful toexamine this development in detail. This has not been a major con-cern of scholarship on the speech.52Cicero’s opening words call attention to the unusual circumstancesof the trial and signal a departure from his usual practice whendefending someone before a jury: ‘Although it is not my usual cus-tom, Citizens, to state my reason for defending a person at the begin-ning of my speech . . .’ (1). He does so because the case is not merelya private matter; it affects the whole state and involves much morethan a personal connection to Rabirius: the salus rei publicae, consulareofficium, and his own consulship (consulatus ipse) demand that he takeup this defense.53Rabirius, he claims, is prosecuted not for a crimeor because of jealousy or as a personal vendetta, but as a pretext50Dio 37.26.3.51Brunt (1988): 321–7.52There are two modern commentaries on the speech, A.

(3)Cicero’s definitions of the consul’s duties suggest military and med-ical aid to the state, the protection of property, active solicitation ofthe citizens’ loyalty, and his own self-sacrifice for the good of thestate. The consul’s physical exertions are balanced by actions requiredof the citizens, although these constitute defensive actions, possess-ing a certain frame of mind, and judging those who fulfill the dutiesof good citizens. Thus, while the consul should be active and self-sacrificing, the citizens should be no less vigilant in defense and standready to obey the consul and the Senate. In this short space, Cicerohas established the need for shared responsibility between consul,Senate and people, and indicated the proper role for each.Having elevated the importance of the case and emphasized hisconsular duty to defend the salus rei publicae, Cicero ostensibly turnsto address the details of the case against Rabirius (6–9). Yet Labienushad limited his speaking time to half an hour and deliberately allowedhim only enough time to speak as a defense counsel, not as consul(6). It would not be the last time in the year that a tribune tried tohinder his influence over the populace through his public speech,but it did create a rhetorical challenge. Moreover, Labienus tried tosidetrack Cicero with technicalities and irrelevant charges: violatingreligious places and groves, embezzlement and burning public records,another murder charge, violations of various laws, and the topic of132 . ,.MAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 132"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"chastity (6–9). It may have been a conscious attempt to tone downthe charges after the archaic first perduellioprocess failed to secureRabirius’ death. If Cicero were to respond to these charges, he wouldbe forced to argue as a petty defense advocate. His greater auctori-tasas consul would be muted; the relentless barrage of his attacksdeflected. Cicero replies by mentioning the charges only to rejectthem at once as irrelevant, insubstantial, or contradicted by Rabirius’character (6–9). Since he had emphasized his need to speak as con-sul in the exordium, Cicero had already established a persona capa-ble of dismissing these ancillary charges. He was ready to focus onthe charge of treason and the sensational murder of Saturninus thatLabienus did not want him to address: ‘that other part of my speech,on the death of Saturninus, which requires not the cleverness of anorator but demands the assistance (auxilium) of a consul, you wantedto be quite short and meager’ (9). Speaking as consul emphasizedCicero’s greater auctoritasover the tribune; it required gravitasandcopia dicendi, and supporting a matter of such national importancerequired a great deal of amplification. Years later, in the Orator, hewould cite the speech for precisely these qualities.54The linchpin for Cicero’s argument that the trial concerns thesafety of the state and requires his consular voice comes in sections10–17. Here he strategically incorporates arguments about the archaicprocedure and cruel punishment of the first perduelliotrial that couldnot be made in it because the procedure forbade a defense speech(12). Labienus may have tried to focus attention on trivial argumentsin the second trial, but Cicero appropriates the main issues involvedin the first in order to elevate the nature of the threat to Rome.The section begins with Cicero’s emotional response to Labienus’charge that he crushed the perduellioprocess (10). Cicero is proud tohave opposed the process: ‘for what could one possibly wish that Iwould prefer to having banished the executioner from the forumand the cross from the campus in my consulship?’ (10). He devel-ops his opposition into an extended synkrisis between himself andLabienus, a virtual contentio dignitatisof who should be considered atrue popularisand friend of the people. He aligns himself first with54Orator102: ius omne retinendae maiestatis Rabirii causa continebatur: ergo in ea omnigenere amplificationis exarsimus.’  133MAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"the venerable maiores, claiming they get the real credit for abolish-ing the executioner and the cross, for when they drove out the kingsthey retained no vestigium crudelitatis regiae; he then appears in thesame camp with the ancient viri forteswho wanted the libertasof theRoman people protected by the lenitas legum, not made intolerableby the acerbitas suppliciorum(10). This leads to a bold, direct comparison:Which of us, then, Labienus, is popularis? You, who think it right toemploy the executioner and chains on the Roman people in the assem-bly itself? who order a cross to be planted and fixed in the campusMartius, in the centuriate assemble, in that holy place? or I, who for-bid the assembly to be polluted by contact with the executioner? whosay the forum of the Roman people ought to be purified from thosevestiges of wicked crime? who urge in defense that the assembly bepreserved unstained, the campus holy, the body of all Roman citizensinviolable, and the right of freedom (ius libertatis) intact? (11)Cicero appropriates nearly all the key terms of popularisrhetoric,especially support of libertas populi Romaniand the Porcian andSempronian laws (12). Mention of Gaius Sempronius Gracchus imme-diately moves Cicero to compare Labienus to this quintessential popu-larispolitician (13–15).55Labienus emerges as the complete antithesisof Gracchus: he wishes to execute a Roman citizen without recourseto the people, he uses cruel language, wants to violate the libertas ofthe Roman people, tries the people’s clemency (mansuetudo, 13).Labienus appears to be crueler than the kings, using phrases suchas, ‘Lictor, go bind his hands,’ and ‘Cover his head; hang him fromthe wretched tree’ (13). Moreover, Cicero deprives Labienus of hisclaims to be popularisby asking why, if his actions were so truly popu-laris, did Gaius Gracchus not use them (14). Finally, when Labienus’actions have been so divorced from those of the supreme ‘friend ofthe people,’ Gracchus emerges as even a better person: he has greaterpietas, animus, consilium, opes, auctoritas, and eloquentia(14). These turnout to be qualities that Cicero shares with Gracchus (15), bringinghis identification with Gracchus full circle. Thus, it is Cicero theconsul, not Labienus the tribune, who has greater claims to be popu-larisin the tradition of Gracchus.At this point, having dilated upon the threat to libertasby Labienus’prosecution and having established himself as the popularischampionof libertasin the spirit of Gaius Gracchus, Cicero turns to his main55Cf.

The fourteen sections devotedto the charge cover just less than half the speech and were slightlylonger but some of the text has been lost toward the beginning andat the end.56This is the part of the speech Labienus wanted to be‘brief and meager’ (9). Consequently, for Cicero it is the high pointof the speech: his opportunity to enact his consular persona, to dis-tinguish himself from Cicero the defense lawyer. He eschews argu-ment about technicalities by claiming that Hortensius had alreadyproved the charge false in great detail (copiosissime, 18). He keeps hisown argument focused on large issues: the protection of citizens’libertasand the senatus auctoritas, the establishment of concordia ordinum,and the self sacrifice of the statesman for the safety of the state(18–31).Cicero says he would, if he could, openly proclaim that Rabiriushad killed Saturninus with his own hand because he would havekilled an enemy of the Roman people (18–19, 31). This was thehonorable, high-minded argument Marcus Brutus would later urgehim to use in his defense of Milo. It was a bold argument; some-one in the crowd shouted (18). He seizes this response—if he didn’tcreate it—and uses it in his favor. Only a few people—the unin-formed—cry out. The silence of the multitude—those who electedCicero consul—confirms him now and even pressures the few torestrain their meager voice, the indicator of their stupidity and proofof their small numbers (18). Cicero employs the audience’s reactionto argue their support for his position: silence indicates consent.57Regardless of whether or not this happened when he delivered hisspeech, Cicero uses it to demonstrate massive popular support of the‘silent majority.’ The whole episode portrays a deft politician inter-acting with his audience.Now for Cicero’s coup d’grace: if he cannot admit that Rabiriuskilled Saturninus he can confess that Rabirius took up arms withthe intent to kill him (19). This move pins Labienus on the hornsof a dilemma: ‘if it was a crime to kill Saturninus, arms could not56According to Poggio, who supplied the text for all the codices we have, therewas one page missing after section 19 and two pages after section 31.

The dilemma for the wishful popularisLabienusis that he could have not argued against the acts of the popular con-sul Marius. His case relied on a distinction between the actions takenby Marius under the SCU and the murder of Saturninus after Mariushad pledged his security (fides, 28).58By linking Rabirius with Mariusand the illustrious men who, under the terms of the SCU, took uparms, but did not kill Saturninus, Cicero undermines Labienus’ dis-tinction and makes it appear that he is attacking all the men whofollowed the consuls that day.His argument begins methodically and with a simple, unadornednarrative style:There was a decree of the Senate that the consuls Gaius Marius andLucius Valerius should call upon the tribunes of the plebs and thepraetors—those whom they thought appropriate—and see to it thatthe power and sovereignty of the Roman people were preserved. Theycalled upon all the tribunes except Saturninus and all the praetorsexcept Glaucia; those who wanted the republic to be safe they orderedto take up arms and follow them. Everyone obeyed. Weapons fromthe temple of Sancus and the public armories were given to the Romanpeople, with Gaius Marius the consul doing the distributing. (20)The style suggests a straightforward description of an historical event.Cicero then turns to Labienus and asks what he would have donein a time of such crisis. Ratcheting higher the stylistic level througha series of rhetorical questions, he emphasizes that the consuls weresupported by the Senate and the equites, marking the occasion asone of consensio bonorum omnium(20). Then he adds the weight of theauctoritas, dignitas, and gravitasof the men who supported Marius, pro-viding the names of over twenty-five individuals and families whotook up arms that day (21–2). The men represent a coalition of menfrom every order and rank, nobiles, populares, homines novi. Their com-mon cause against Saturninus exhibits concordia ordinumin action.A decade later in the De Re PublicaCicero says that in a civil dis-sention he thinks citizens ought to be weighed rather than counted,that the bonishould be more important than the multi.59So he begins58Tyrrell (1978): 129–30.59Rep. 6.1: et vero in dissentione civili, cum boni plus quam multi valent, expedendos civis,non numerandos puto.136 . ,.MAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 136"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"the argument here, oppressing Labienus with the auctoritasand gravitasof Marius’ men, but he also adds the argument about the multi, con-triving to have it both ways, emphasizing the multitudo bonorum(23).Continuing a series of relentless direct questions, Cicero asks Labienusif he would not join forces with the multitude, demolishing poten-tial counter arguments with remarks about the numbers of men ortheir morals on the opposing sides (23–4). Finally, Cicero suggeststhat Labienus’ identification with Saturninus has reached a danger-ous level. The people have condemned others and rescinded theircitizen rights for lamenting the death of Saturninus as Labienus hasdone and for possessing a funeral bust of Saturninus such as Labienusbrought to the trial (25). Isolated from the multitudo bonorumandidentified with Saturninus, Labienus risks similar losses. The peopleof that previous day, the multitudo bonorum, have also become a modelfor the jurors in the current trial.At this point, Cicero eases his argument against Labienus andappears as a stern but compassionate father figure interested in cor-recting Labienus’ wayward behavior. He blames Labienus’ youthfulimprudentiafor prosecuting this case, an issue that was ‘dead beforeyou were born,’ and claims that Labienus would have been onRabirius’ side if he had been old enough at the time (25). Ciceroeducates Labienus about the illustrious men who were on Marius’side by listing their virtues as if he were delivering their funeral ora-tion: summa sapientia, eximia virtus, singularis humanitas, gravitas, consilium,prudentia, ingenium, dignitas(26). These men were the gubernatores rei pub-licaewho, along with the equites, the tribuni aerarii, and other ordinesoffer models for emulation (27). In effect, Cicero has usurped thelaudatio funebriselements that Labienus probably employed to praisehis deceased uncle and parade Saturninus’ funeral bust.60Cicero assumes the mantle of the pater familiasof the Roman stateto preserve the famaof the ancestors for his Roman family (27). Asa successor to Marius, pater patriae(27), Cicero defends his prede-cessor’s famaagainst Labienus’ charges (28). He rises above the quo-tidian details of the case and even the temporal limits of the issuesto focus on the future and the issues that transcend the day. Hetaps into the widespread belief that great men sacrifice themselves60For the elements of the laudatio funebris, see W.

He ends with a gnomic statement on the impor-tance of preserving the memory of the dead that was as appropri-ate for every father to teach his son as it is for Cicero the consuldefending the state: ‘If we honor those who have already left life,we leave behind us a condition more deserving of honor in the caseof our own death’ (31).In the peroratioCicero indicates that he has worked with both theSenate and the people, specifically recalling Rullus’ agrarian landlegislation and how the people rejected the bill that was supposedlyin their interest (32). He reiterates his claim from De Lege AgrariathatRome faces an internal enemy, this time saying he agrees with theauthor of the trial, thought to be Julius Caesar:I shout, proclaim, and announce the same thing the author of thistrial proclaims: there is no king left, no people, no nation which youshould fear; there is no foreign, no external evil that can work its wayinto this republic. If you wish this state to be immortal, this empireto be eternal, our glory to last forever, we must be wary of our owndesires, or troublemakers who want revolution, of internal evils and ofdomestic schemes. (33)The internal threats again call for a statesman who can manage andprotect civil matters with his voice: ‘Your ancestors left you a greatprotection against these evils in that expression of the consul (vocemillam consulis): “Those who wish the republic to be safe...”’ (34).The consul’s words to the citizens to save the state are the praesidiumagainst internal evils. Although the text is extremely lacunose, Ciceromay indicate that this voxilluminates plots against the state (cf. Leg.Agr. 1.24) and is the hope of libertas, salus, and maiestas.62Having emphasized the utility of the vox consulis, Cicero turns brieflyto consider what he would do if Labienus chose to follow in Saturninus’61For Cicero’s development of this idea, see V. Buchheit, “Ciceros Triumph desGeistes,” Gymnasium 76 (1969): 232–253; reprinted in Ciceros literarische Leistung, editedby B.

At the moment, he sees no arms, yet he uses a military expres-sion to suit his use of oratory to protect the state: ‘I thought I shouldnot call you to arms, but rouse you to vote’ (35). The orator, notthe general, is needed. This emphasis on voxrather than armaandthe sequence of events Cicero would follow in Labienus’ hypotheti-cal attack on the state not only mirrors Marius’ actions, but willbecome almost a blueprint for Cicero’s handling of the Catilinarianconspiracy.The final sections return to the distinction between a regulardefense trial and Cicero’s defense of the state. He includes a ratherstock appeal to pity for Rabirius due to his wounds, age, reputation,and fear of dying away from the patriahe earlier defended (36–7).The poor state of the text makes it unclear whether Cicero com-mented on his need for such an appeal, though it seems likely thatit was expected, especially since Cicero was a master at it.63Thevery last sentence, however, returns to the distinction between therequirements of a defense of a friend and defense of the state: ‘Ihave spoken for the amount of time allotted me by the tribune. Iask and beseech you to consider this speech of mine a loyal act fora friend in danger, and a consular act for the welfare of the state’(pro rei publicae salute consularem, 38).The return to this dual role of private and public defender requiresthe jurors and the reader to assess Cicero’s dual performance: didhe carry it off? Answers will vary about his success. The analysishas tried to indicate how he met the challenge, showing in partic-ular the linear development of a consular ethos to enable Cicero tomake the argument Labienus sought to preclude. In terms of enhanc-ing Cicero’s consular image, the speech unifies senatorial and pop-ular interests to protect Rabirius and the SCU, and demonstratesthe history of this concordia ordinumwith examples from the consul-ship of Marius. He calls attention to the cooperation of Senate andpeople earlier in the year under his direction and the speeches DeLege Agraria(33). Yet, Pro Rabirio Perduellionis Reoadds a new dimen-sion to Cicero’s consular ethos by distinguishing between his well-known status as the leading defense pleader in Rome and his auctoritas63Orator 130–2.’  139MAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 139"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"as consul speaking on state matters. Since the first was ingrained inthe minds of the people, and probably used against Cicero byLabienus, Cicero proceeded slowly and carefully to construct a con-sular ethos that allowed him to transcend his former status. Thisprocess of ethos construction cannot be separated from the argu-ment in defense of Rabirius for it enables the argument. It is a shortstep to Cicero’s post-consular judicial speeches where his ethos is hisargument.64The next two speeches in the consular corpus are lost. In thespeech On the Sons of the Proscribed, Cicero seems to have upheld theSullan prohibition on the sons of the proscribed from holding office.65A tribune may have proposed abolishing the law in a bid for pop-ular support; Caesar is thought to have been behind the measure.According to testimonia the speech showed Cicero making a toughargument before the people, opposing a measure most likely billedas in their interest. The one surviving fragment, quoted by Quintilian,seems to indicate Cicero’s dilemma. Nevertheless, he was successful:the consul had once again navigated safely between the clashingrocks of senatorial and popular interests.The speech Cicero delivered when he gave up his province hasbeen completely lost.66There is little to say but that he renouncedhis consular province in the assembly and the people protested. Itis difficult to see how the move would have appealed to either theSenate or the people. It is possible that Cicero argued that his pres-ence was needed in Rome, despite the good will and desire of theSenate and people for him to reap the rewards of a province. If so,the speech may have emphasized the need for an orator politicianrather than a military general. But this is speculation.Leading the State as Consul in a Time of CrisisThe final speeches in the consular corpus are the four Orationes inCatilinam, or Catilinarians. The First Catilinarianis Cicero’s best known64J. M. May, Trials of Character: The Eloquence of Ciceronian Ethos(Chapel Hill andLondon: University of North Carolina Press 1988): 69–79; cf. D. H.

Unfortunately, it is often read in isolation, divorced from thecontext of the consular corpus and even of the other Catilinarians.The four speeches address the revolutionary schemes of the patri-cian Lucius Sergius Catilina and his band of conspirators who areplotting a military and political coup. The speeches form an identifiablesubset of the consular corpus and fitting conclusion for they showCicero engaging in the rhetorical containment of a true national cri-sis.67In the CatilinariansCicero rises above the usual concerns of aconsul and propels himself into the ranks of Rome’s most importantstatesmen.68The ethos constructed in the earlier consular speechesis now fully developed and ready to be deployed in protecting Romefrom this crisis.69The historical background to the conspiracy is well known, so onlya brief summary is needed.70Catiline, an ambitious patrician witha checkered private life, had a successful political career until hereturned from governing Africa as propraetor and was prosecutedfor embezzlement in 66 B.C. This and another prosecution frustratedhis attempts to stand for the consulship in 65 and 64. For 63, heformed an alliance with Antonius against Cicero and the other com-petitors, but Cicero helped quash his chances for election by deliv-ering a scathing speech against him in the Senate (In Toga Candida).He stood again for the consulship of 62, but Cicero, presiding atthe election, helped ensure his defeat once more. This blow to hispatrician pride by a homo novuswas more than Catiline could bear.Given to violence and having already uttered not so vague threats67Cicero delivered other speeches against Catiline, the most notable being whenhe revealed the conspiracy on October 21, but he chose not to publish them or toinclude them in his consular corpus. See Crawford (1984): 88–89. The four speecheshe did publish were expected to represent his views and arguments. That the FirstCatilinarianwas not the first delivered but is the first we read has distorted our pic-ture of the beginning of the conspiracy. Some recent scholarship on the individualspeeches will be noted below; there has been little on how the four speeches worktogether; for one attempt, see R. W. Cape, Jr., On Reading Cicero’s Catilinarian Orations,Ph.D. Diss., University of California, Los Angeles, 1991.68Modern scholars have different opinions about whether the Catilinarian con-spiracy deserves to be called a major incident in the history of the late Republic,but there is no doubt that Cicero’s handling of the crisis made him politically impor-tant for the rest of his life.69The standard treatment of Cicero’s ethos in the First Catilinarianis Batstone(1994): 211–266.70The ancient sources are collected together with comments by modern histori-ans in H.

Detailed information wasbrought to Cicero and relayed by him to the Senate on 20 October.On 21 October the Senate issued the SCU with Catiline as theintended target. But Cicero hesitated and refused to act rashly; nodoubt the case of Rabirius weighed on his mind. He waited andcontinued to gather information until Catiline sent two henchmento murder Cicero in his bed on the morning of 7 November. Cicerothwarted their attempt and called the Senate into session for thenext day at the temple of Jupiter Stator, Jupiter who keeps soldiersfrom retreating and gives them strength to overcome an enemyalready bearing down upon them. In this symbolic location Cicerodelivered his First Catilinarian.71Cicero’s primary rhetorical challenge in the First Catilinarianis toinform the Senate about the extent of Catiline’s conspiracy and jus-tify his own apparent inaction.72Rome was already in a state of cri-sis; the Senate had issued the SCU; yet certain problematic issueslingered. Most important among these were the lack of direct evi-dence against Catiline and Cicero’s credibility against Catiline thepatrician. Cicero had convinced the aristocrats that one of their ownwas plotting violence against them and Rome, but his status as ahomo novushardly gave him sufficient auctoritasto carry his point with-out incontrovertible proof. In this sense, the speech may exhibit a‘crisis of legitimacy,’ as Cicero endeavors to shore up his auctoritasbefore the senators.73But the First Catilinarianis not unique in thisregard: every speech in the consular corpus exhibits a crisis of legit-imacy wherein Cicero must appropriate the language and symbolsof an antagonist who has better claims to the audience’s sympathy.Moreover, Cicero’s arguments across the four speeches continue toaddress the intersection of conservative and popular interests: he does71See the excellent treatment of this by A.

The brief consider-ation of the Catilinarian Orationshere will proceed on assumptionsthat differ markedly from standard scholarship on the speeches inthat the texts will be examined as the culmination of Cicero’s con-sular ethos as developed in his other consular orations.74The First Catilinarianis the opening salvo in an extended debateon a national crisis.

Such discourseis expected to offer quick solutions, preserve strength and integrityof the nation and its leadership, justify necessary action, garner sup-port for action, correct misperceptions and recover from setbacks.’75Features of crisis rhetoric in Cicero’s and Demosthenes’ speechesinclude, ‘the polarization of the conflict into a dichotomy betweengood and evil, right and wrong, which is often simplistic in itsapproach,’ where the crisis is presented by the orator as a ‘funda-mental crisis of the civilization that he represents,’ which ‘accountsfor his intractability, his refusal to compromise or to deal with theenemy, his demand for absolute victory or honorable defeat.’76Moreover, the orator becomes a ‘laudator temporis acti,’ compares thegood old days to the degenerate present time, and tries to imitate‘role-models and to see the crisis that he faces in terms of patternsthat have appeared in the past.’77The First Catilinarianshares allthese characteristics except one—a quick solution—and therein liesits particular contribution.Cicero’s famous opening words accuse Catiline of being a long-standing threat to the state, ‘How long, then, Catiline, will you abuseour patience?’ (1). The immediate cause of the speech is Catiline’s74Space does not allow for a full treatment of the Catilinarians here; I intendto offer an extended analysis elsewhere.75A.

The opening is delivered in such a high, emotional style thatone can almost see the nervous consul still noticeably shaken fromhaving escaped an assassination attack (1–3). There is new informa-tion: Catiline’s grand scheme for taking over Rome was laid out thenight before at the private house of Marcus Porcius Laeca (8–10).This is added to the list of his previous crimes: he has raised anarmy (5, 24), already planned to murder senators and capture Prae-neste (7–8), corrupted the youth (13), murdered his wife and son totake on a new bride, ruined the family fortune (14), and has triedbefore to kill senators and consuls (15). The Patriaherself claimsCatiline has been plotting against her, has already murdered citizenswith impunity, and is planning to overturn the courts and Rome’slaws (17–18). The threat is made obvious and a sense of urgency isestablished.Yet the object of the First Catilinarianis not Catiline, at least notin the sense that Cicero is exposing his conspiracy for the first time.It is Catiline’s accomplices, as yet unnamed, save for Laeca, by impli-cation, and Gaius Manlius (5, 7, 10). Catiline deserves to be killed,Cicero says, and will be when there is no one like him who willthink it wrong (5–6). Cicero outlines the actions of Catiline’s co-con-spirators (7–8) and claims that some even sit in the Senate, unno-ticed by others (9). He stirs up a sense of fear and distrust byemphasizing the secrecy of Catiline’s plans: they take place at night,at an individual’s house, on the scythe-makers’ street (1, 6, 8–10).He unsettles the senators by pointing out that some do not see whatis happening, and some even support the conspiracy by not believ-ing it could happen (30).The magnitude of the threat to Rome by Catiline and his asso-ciates requires a suitable counter response from a strong consul (12),but here Cicero deliberately defeats the audience’s expectation. Theswift and decisive actions of Ahala, Scipio, Opimius, Marius andValerius are praised: in their day traitors were killed at once (3–4).Following the mos maiorumwould be best (27–28). Yet Cicero refusesto follow suit. He blames himself for inaction (3–4, 9), but in thespeech he deliberately refuses to take the actions recommended tohim (20, 27–29).In the fervid political competition of the late Republic, the ten-sion between following tradition and striving to be first, best, and144 . ,.MAY_f6_112-158 7/11/02 8:49 PM Page 144"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"greatest in some sphere was enormous.78The response Cicero choosesis not the traditional one of resorting to arms. That was the solu-tion against Gaius Gracchus and Saturninus, which resulted in tri-als for those who followed the SCU. The danger to the individualwas great, as was that to the state if the SCU were undermined, asCicero knew only too well from the Rabirius case. Cicero’s solutionis not to resort to arms until everything was made clear and Catiline’ssecret supporters were flushed out (5–6, 12, 30). And what is moresuited to illuminating dark plans, as Cicero claimed he would do inDe Lege AgrariaI, than the vox et auctoritas consulis(1.24). In the FirstCatilinarianCicero emphasizes the function of his voice to ‘wound’Catiline, to force him out of the city, and to reveal his accomplices(9, 16, 20–23, 32).79Cicero appears as a new type of consul, one who does not rushin to use violence against a traitor, but who tries to use reason andrhetoric to educate his audience about unseen dangers (30). Heexhibits the opposite qualities of Catiline’s furorand amentia(1–2, 8,15, 22, 25, 31). He tries to show the popularisqualities of clementia,lenitasand misericordiafamiliar from the other consular speeches (4,12, 16). He reiterates his hope that Catiline himself can be broughtback to reason (6, 12–13, 21–22). Earlier in the year he had heldout his hand to Rullus and Labienus to turn them around; littlegood it did then, or would do now, but it helps Cicero appear rea-sonable and willing to help those who have lost their way (16, 22).Cicero emerges as a consul absolutely confident in his convictions,doggedly determined to follow his own course despite the burden oftradition, the emotional imprecations of the Patria, despite the futureinvidiahe knows awaits him. As he has shown in the other consularspeeches, he is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of the stateas a whole. It is the salus rei publicaeto which he has devoted him-self (8, 12, 14, 29, 33), presaging his remark in De Legibusthat forconsuls salus populi suprema lex esto(3.8).The salus populi Romaniis Cicero’s great concern in the next twospeeches, delivered before the people.

Such reports were a regular feature of Romanpolitical oratory, although as a genre their similarities of form andpurpose have not been studied.80The magistrate who reported tothe people could be seen as the people’s friend; sharing informationwith them was to involve them in important political debate. Suchspeeches identify and constitute their audience as ‘the Roman peo-ple,’ construct an appropriate ethos for the speaker, clarify the peo-ple’s relationship to the Senate and the speaker’s relationship to thepeople, and interpret the Senate’s actions. These speeches do notcall for legislative action, nor are they meant to confirm the Senate’srecommendations, yet they show a speaker’s willingness to addressthe people and to affirm their importance. They influence politicalopinion.Catiline and his followers had already tried to influence publicopinion as he was leaving Rome. Some claimed he was ordered intoexile by a despotic consul (12–14). He said he would go into exileat Marseilles (15–16). He wrote letters to former consuls and impor-tant men claiming he was forced out by his enemies, that he wasnot conscious of having committed any crime and was leaving tospare the city from any disruption on his account. He wrote toQuintus Catulus, the leading conservative at Rome, saying his dig-nitashad been attacked and asking him to look after his wife.81Cicero’s first task was to counter Catiline’s own rhetoric about hisdeparture.Cicero opens the Second Catilinarianwith a scathing depiction ofCatiline as a monster, breathing destruction, who has left (or beenejected from) the city so all can cease to fear for their lives (1–6).82To the reader of the consular speeches the portrait of Catiline isconsistent with that painted in the First Catilinarian, but the originalaudience of the speech needed to have the evil picture of Catilinepainted for them. Cicero does this not by making the same argu-80There are four speeches in Cicero’s works that fit this genre, Cat. 2 and 3,and Phil. 4 and 6.

It also contributesto Cicero’s persona by allowing him to step forward as a de-factosuccessful consul, even if the audience is not altogether certain whatthat success entails.The portrait of Catiline as a monster is so completely antitheti-cal to Roman values that anyone who associates with him must beun-Roman themselves (1–6). In general, he attracts the worst peo-ple to himself:What poisoner in all Italy, what gladiator, what bandit, what assassin,what parricide, what falsifier of wills, what swindler, what debauchee,what spendthrift, what adulterer, what woman of ill-repute, what cor-rupter of youth, what corrupted person, what wretched soul can befound who does not confess that he has lived with Catiline on themost familiar terms? (7)Catiline’s associates are social and moral degenerates (7–9). LaterCicero will identify in detail the six types of worthless people whofollow Catiline, including bankrupt aristocrats and Sulla’s veteranswho would like to raise him from the dead along with the moregenerally morally debased (18–23). He emphasizes the abominationsof Catiline and his associates in terms that respectable Romans couldnot have identified with.83Objections might be made about theapplicability of the categories to Catiline’s men, but not that the cat-egories themselves were unacceptable to Romans.The immediate and thorough character-bashing of the patricianCatiline and his Sulla-sympathizing followers is calculated to makethem repulsive to the Roman people. The people are defined bytheir complete moral opposition to the conspirators:On our side fights decency, on theirs wantonness; on ours fights mod-esty, on theirs defilement; here truth, there deceit; here piety, thereevil; here steadfastness, there irrationality; here honor, there shame;here restraint, there lust; so, on our side equity, temperance, bravery,reason—all the virtues—fight against injustice, luxury, laziness, rash-83For general discussion, see C.

Finally, our wealth contrasts with theirpoverty, our good reason with their deranged plan, a sound mind witha witless one, and good hope with complete despair. (25)This synkrisis of virtues and vices defines the people only as theantithesis of evil. This is an unconventional war, not against a for-eign king but against an internal enemy, ‘against luxury, madness,and evil’ (11). It is the culmination of the warning Cicero had givenin De Lege Agraria(1.26) and Pro Rabirio(33).Cicero uses fear to unite the people, but he also offers hope. Heproclaims himself the people’s general in this war of virtue againstvice (11). There is no need for a regular commander since the degen-erates will be too weak to mount a serious military opposition (5,23–24). Instead, Cicero proclaims himself dux togatus et imperatorwhowill try to resolve the crisis from within the city (28):84‘what can becured (sanari) I shall cure (sanabo) by whatever means; what must becut out I will not allow to remain to harm the state’ (11). The con-spirators are a disease and Cicero offers his consulship and oratioasa medicina(11, 17). Cicero’s speech has already triumphed by expos-ing Catiline and forcing him from town (3); it is still needed to illu-minate the dark plans and reveal the identities of the remainingconspirators. In the meantime, Cicero’s foresight and actions protectthe city and thwart Catiline’s plans (26).Finally, Cicero unites the people in a defensive action against thethreat of the conspirators by exhorting them to protect their homesand pray to the gods (26, 29). He calls the people to do their dutyin this time of crisis as he said he would in the speech for Rabirius(Rab. 3). He promises that when the time comes for direct actionthe consuls and the Senate will be brave (27). By acting accordingto the roles assigned by speeches earlier in the year, each order willcontribute to peace; concordia ordinumwill be achieved and the citywill be safe.The Second Catilinariandisplays a confident consul using his ora-tory to inform the people, heal a civic threat, and enact policies heoutlined earlier in the year. It parallels the First Catilinariandeliveredbefore the Senate. Cicero is no longer developing his image as aserious-minded statesman; he has become one.

Reportagefills the first half of the speech as Cicero relates his plans to trapthe conspirators and how they confessed in the Senate (1–15). Thedetailed treatment of the events recalls his discussion of Rullus’ billbefore the people in De Lege AgrariaII. Descriptions of Cicero’s fore-sight and actions and the conspirators’ confessions demonstrate Cicero’sscrupulous care and respect for justice and the dignitasof the offenders.The proofs of their guilt come in several forms: written documents,oral testimony, physical signs, actual confession. There can be nodoubt: the conspirators are manifestly guilty. Cicero has made goodon his previous promises: the plots were ‘brought out into the light,made clear, and discovered’ by him (3). Finally, the Senate thankedhim for saving the commonwealth from danger through his virtus,consilium, and providentia(14), the virtues of the great statesman,85andsome of the virtutesCicero had assigned to the gubernatores rei publicaein Pro Rabirio(26).Cicero’s status as one of Rome’s great leaders is confirmed in sev-eral ways. The words of the Senate’s decree not only list his virtues,they record a supplicatioawarded in Cicero’s name, the first evergranted to a civilian (15, 23). Cicero’s act of saving the city fromdestruction is compared to Romulus’ act of founding it, implicitlycomparing the status of the two men (2; cf. 19). Cicero is comparedto Pompey in that between the two of them they have ensured therewill be no trouble at home or abroad (26). Finally, the gods confirmCicero’s acts and his special favor with them (18, 22), indicating anassociation with divinity often claimed by Rome’s great men.86Theerection of the new statue to Jupiter Optimus Maximus on theCapitoline the very day the conspirators confessed gives striking85Hellegouarc’h (1972): 254–274.86See Religions of Rome: Volume I, A History, edited by M.

He succeeded in a civil battleagainst evil citizens as dux togatus et imperator(23). He did not resortto arms as the previous consuls had done against traitors (24–25).He achieved his ends with concordia(25). He did not create a pub-lic disturbance (7, 23). He promises peace (29). He fulfilled the dutiesof a good consul, as he defined them in the speech for Rabirius(Rab. 3), and he calls once more on the people to pray to the godsand defend their homes (29). If Cicero’s overwhelming success withthe people in this speech were known to his readers,88it would fur-ther legitimate his earlier claim to be popularis consuland his promiseto address the people about important political matters (Leg. Agr.1.23–24, 2.6–7).On 4 December, the Senate reconvened and declared that theconspirators had acted contra rem publicam.89There was, however, noclear decision about the fate of the conspirators. That would comeon the next day, 5 December, when Cicero delivered the last of hisconsular orations, the Fourth Catilinarian. The debate opened with theproposal of Decimus Silanus, consul-elect, that the conspirators shouldsuffer the greatest punishment, understood to mean execution.90Therewas general agreement, including all the former consuls, until thepraetor-elect Julius Caesar spoke. He argued that although citizenscould not be punished by death, the conspirators should be held incustody without hope of release, and that all their property beconfiscated. Many seemed to agree with Caesar; Silanus opted fora compromise position and argued that he had not meant the deathpenalty. Finally, at the end of a long debate—perhaps lengthenedfor this reason—the tribune-elect Marcus Cato argued forcefully forexecution. Cicero called for a vote on Cato’s proposal and it passed.Cicero then had the conspirators executed that day.Cicero’s Fourth Catilinariancomes in the middle of the debate as87Vasaly (1993): 60–87.88Sallust, BC48.1–2.89Sallust, BC50.3.90Sallust, BC50.3–53.1.

It does not yetcall for a vote, but in its emphasis on the future and argumentsbased on the past, on the utileand the bonum, the Fourth Catilinarianbest fits the generic requirements of political oratory.91Cicero opens with an exhortation to the senators to decide whatis best for the country and put aside their fears for his personalsafety (1–4). He elicits their pity by recounting the dangers that awaithim while simultaneously bidding the senators to disregard them. Hethus distinguishes himself from the senators, displaying the greatstatesman’s almost philosophical detachment from current, physicaldanger, focused on future rewards, as he indicated in the speech forRabirius (Rab. 29), and nevertheless encouraging the senators to pro-tect themselves and their families (3). He admonishes the senatorsas a senior statesman, even employing the ship of state metaphor:they ought to devote themselves to the welfare of the state (salutemrei publicae), and take precautions against all storms which will threatenunless they show foresight (4).In the interest of appearing fair, Cicero refers the matter to theSenate as if it were new (6). He uses judicial language to suggestthat the Senate had already decided the case: the conspirators haveconfessed, the Senate has already passed judgement, the conspira-tors seem condemned (5). Nevertheless, the senatorial debate repre-sented here is conducted as if the Senate has a free hand to decidewhat it will for the good of the state. The consul provides an osten-sibly objective outline of the proposals by Silanus and Caesar (6–10).He points out the paradox that Silanus’ proposal for death is actu-ally kinder than Caesar’s which forces the men to live on miserablywith no hope of salvation (11), but maintains that he is willing tofollow whatever the Senate decides (24). Cicero the consul must notbe seen dictating to the Senate what course it should take.Despite the need to let the Senate make its own decision, Ciceroclearly favors Silanus’ proposal. He cannot force the Senate to adopt91R. W. Cape.

He begins by stressing his own feelings of compassion, his mis-ericordiaand humanitas, recalling the lenitashe has shown throughoutthe speeches, verging on his popularisqualities from earlier in theyear. He can ask, ‘who is kinder (mitior) than I?’ (11) in an attemptto appropriate Caesar’s popularisposition in the same way he didLabienus’ in the speech for Rabirius (Rab. 11). Nevertheless, he arguesthat it is natural for murder or attempted murder to be avenged bycapital punishment; to do otherwise would be unjust to the actualor intended victims (12–13). As a result, he claims that being toughon the conspirators will be seen as being merciful; going easy onthem would be considered a cruel act against the state and the cit-izens (13).At this point, Cicero brings the citizens into his argument, point-ing out that the forum and temples are full of people who are will-ing to protect the state and detailing support from all social classes(14–17). He uses this support as pressure on the Senate: ‘Since thisis so, senators, the protection of the Roman people does not failyou; see to it that you do not fail the Roman people’ (18). He buildsthis pressure, discussing his qualities as consul, point out that every-one in Rome agrees: ‘All orders (omnes ordines) agree on the preser-vation of the commonwealth with their intention, their will, theirvoice’ (18). Even the Patriais reintroduced, this time as a suppliantto the Senate. Cicero’s concordia ordinumhas been achieved, not asan abstract ideal, but as an instance of civic government. It repre-sents not simply unity, but unity of purpose.Cicero ends with speech with an extended discussion of himselfand his virtues as consul (20–24). He stresses his self-sacrifice, recallsthe honors accrued (20), and compares himself to other great Romans(21). He distinguishes his achievements from the others in terms thatrecall the non-traditional role he undertook in the First Catilinarian:they achieved success in war against external enemies; his victory isover evil citizens who threatened the state from inside (22). His isthe more difficult victory, he stresses, because he must continue tolive among some of the citizens. Nevertheless, his achievement issuch that no force could ever break such a coalition of Roman equites,senators, and all good men (22).The reader of the consular corpus that Cicero envisioned wouldhave known the outcome of the senatorial debate.

Readersmay or may not have known of Cato’s important role, but Cato’ssuccess was only to have framed the proposal, not to have broughtthe matter to light, referred to the Senate, and resolved on the propercourse of action.92The Fourth Catilinarianis not the speech that decidedthe day, but it is not intended to represent that moment. Cicero, aspresiding consul, could not have delivered the speech he put up fora vote. The Fourth Catilinarianshows Cicero the consul who is at thehelm of the state, guiding senatorial debate.ConclusionThe events following the Senate meeting and the execution of theconspirators seemed to confirm Cicero’s status as the leading manat Rome: the crowd, solemn at the execution, now escorted himhome ‘with shouts and applause’; women lit the way with torchesfrom the rooftops of houses to get a better look as he went by; hewas escorted by the best men; they hailed him as savior of the cityand father of his country. It was like a triumph. News of the eventmade Catiline’s men in the field lose heart.93The Roman peopleand the events indicated that what he claimed to have achieved was true.Yet Cicero’s troubles began soon thereafter, and at the end of themonth he was prohibited from giving the customary oration whena consul completed his office: the popular power of Cicero’s oratorywas clear, and the tribune Metellus Nepos wanted to deprive himof it. In the end, allowed only to swear the vow that he had per-formed his duties, Cicero used the opportunity to claim that he alonesaved the state. The people loved it.94With his status and future in a precarious state, it is no wonderthat Cicero published his speeches. What has not been appreciatedis how Cicero—by 60 B.C., at least—wanted readers to see the largerpicture of his achievements and his development as consul. Perhapsit was to put the Catilinarians in context, for they would have beenthe most eagerly read and the easiest for his enemies to misread.92Att. 12.21.1.93Pis. 6–7, Plut. Cic. 22.4–8, Sall.

It suggestsa unity of theme and development of character that are importantto recover.This essay has tried to indicate some of common themes in thespeeches and chart the development of Cicero’s consular ethos asthe year progresses. Cicero’s primary purpose in the speeches De LegeAgrariais to define himself and his policies. These speeches boldlyannounce a political and social plan of action for his consular year.The remaining speeches testify that he has carried it through. Cicerobuilds upon his stance as a consul popularis in Pro Rabirio PerduellionisReo and negotiates the transition from simple defense counsel to aconsul attending to the highest business of state. The careful trans-formation of Cicero’s ethos, illustrated by the close attention givenabove to its linear development, makes it a pivotal speech in theconsular corpus. Finally, in the Catilinarians Cicero relies on his estab-lished ethos to show himself in the image of the good statesman.Consistent with the competitive climate of Late Republican publiclife, he articulates a new plan of action against traitors to the stateand becomes an example of the optimus consul.When Cicero sent the speeches to Atticus he did so as examplesof what he said and did. In later accounts of his consulship, he andothers would summarize his consulship simply by listing these speeches.In the oration In Pisonemhe sums up his consulship by recalling thesituation of each of these speeches (4–7). He then concludes, exposuibreviter consulatum meum(8). Plutarch’s account of Cicero’s consulshipalso focuses on these speeches.96But Plutarch also reflects on Cicero’spractice and between the speeches on the agrarian legislation andthe speech for Otho makes a general comment about the contribu-tions of oratory when employed justly by the good statesman:95The most extensive search for anachronisms has been conducted by C. Helm,Zur Redaktion der Ciceronischen Konsulatsreden, PhD Diss., Göttingen, 1979.

In the first instance, the speecheswere understood to represent what Cicero did and said in his con-sular year. Beyond that, they demonstrated a high-minded politicalstyle of oratory and a similarly high-minded politician. Content andself-presentation are inextricably entwined. When he sent the speechesto Atticus, Cicero was concerned that they seem weighty enough,suitably Demosthenic, and aesthetically pleasing. The reading ofPlutarch indicates that some ancient readers found in the speechesthe very qualities that Cicero hoped they would show.98BAchard, G.

RiggsbyIntroductionThe phrase ‘post reditumspeeches’ has at least two senses. In a nar-rower sense, it generally refers to four of Cicero’s speeches from theimmediate aftermath of his return from exile and dealing with mat-ters arising from that exile and return: Post Reditum ad Senatum, PostReditum ad Populum, De Domo Sua, and De Haruspicum Responsis.2In abroader sense, the one in which it is used here, it includes all thespeeches between Cicero’s return and the dictatorship of Caesar, ofwhich fourteen survive. This is the largest and most diverse groupof speeches considered in this volume. The speeches span only a fewyears, but they were politically turbulent ones. The addressees com-prise the Senate, the Roman people, the Pontifical College, severalcriminal juries, and one panel deciding a citizenship case. We lackonly a private law suit from this period. The three main genres offorensic, deliberative, and epideictic oratory are all represented. Some1591Scholarly commentaries of the last century or so include C. Klodt, ed. andcomm. Ciceros Rede Pro Rabirio Postumo(Stuttgart: Teubner 1992), J. Lenaghan, ACommentary of Cicero’s Oration De Haruspicum Responso(The Hague: Mouton 1969), L.

For the speech in responseto the haruspices Quint. 5.11.42 and the MSS of Cicero give the plural responsis;Asc. 70.3, 22C gives the singular. The body of the speech uses both the singularand plural, though the former might be taken to refer to particular items in theharuspices’ list. Nothing significant seems to depend on the issue.MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 159"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"3Also Dom. 35, 41, 101, 123, 130–1; Har. 26–7; Pis. 43, 95; Sest. 48, 72, 127,141–3; PC18–19; Balb. 21, 28, 34, 40, 50–1, 53, 55; Planc. 20, 51–2, 60, 69–70,88; Scaur. fr.

Instead of trying to fabricate an essential type of thepost reditumoration, then, I want to treat these speeches polytheti-cally. The sections of this chapter will treat a number of themes,each of which is important to a significant number of speeches. Iwill begin with the themes most closely tied to the specific historicalcircumstances of the period, then move to issues of broader relevance.HistoryAbout four fifths of the way through his speech against Piso (80),Cicero interrupts himself saying Sed praeterita omitto‘Enough of thepast!’ A former, student owner of my copy of the speech has scrawledin the margin the comment ‘a joke.’ In the immediate context thisis perhaps unfair to Cicero. He is making a transition from a para-graph’s argument about his past dealings with Caesar to a longerone about the present state of their relationship. But in the broadercontext of the speech, Cicero’s remark does ring strange, almost tothe point of humor. For most of the speech is about the past in oneway or another. Moreover, the same can be said of many of theother post reditumspeeches as well. This section will consider the sev-eral senses in with these speeches are tied up with the past. In somerespects Cicero is driven by generic necessity or broader Roman ora-torical tradition, but in others the concerns seem to be specificallyhis own.Any student of Roman oratory will be familiar with the use ofexempla—anecdotes from the historical or even mythical past—tomake moral, political, or logical points. These are plentiful in thepost reditumspeeches as when Cicero defends a client’s sharp tongueby recalling earlier examples of equestrian free-speaking (Planc. 33–4),or when he gives a series of Greek and Roman examples of riskingone’s own life for one’s country (Sest. 48), or explains what signs agoddess will give to warn that she has been violated:3MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 160"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"And if we wish to call to mind the things which have been handeddown to us about each god, we have learned that this Magna Mater(whose games have been violated, polluted, and virtually turned intothe death and funeral of the state, wanders the fields and groves witha furious noise. She, she shows traces of their crimes and bares signsof danger to the Roman people. (Har. 24)4Many of these are of a sort that could have been (and presumablywere) used by other orators of the period, but in his speeches Ciceroalso makes frequent use of exempla to make two points of more per-sonal concern. On the one hand, he compares the terms and cir-cumstances of his recall from exile (including the rebuilding of hishouse at public expense) to those of earlier figures. Some great cit-izens such as Marius, L. Opimius, and P. Popilius were never recalledat all (RP9–11, RS38). Others, like Kaeso Quinctius and ServiliusAhala, were recalled, but only after the original disgrace of a properconviction by an assembly of the people (Dom.86). Cicero’s recallcame with unique ornaments such as senatorial decrees calling onthe magistrates and promagistrates to safeguard him and summon-ing the people of Italy to approve his recall (Sest. 128, cf. RS27–8,Pis. 51–2). The orator can be quite subtle in detecting gradations ofhonor, as when he discusses the rebuilding of his house:I assert that in the case of no public building, no monument, no tem-ple are there so many decrees of the senate as about my house, whichalone since the founding of this city the senate decreed should berebuilt from the public treasury, should be set free by the pontifs,defended by the magistrates, and avenged by the courts. A house onthe Velia was given to Publius Valerius at public expense for his incred-ible contributions to the republic, but mine was restored on the Palatine.He got a location, I got walls and a roof. He defended his own rightsunder private law; all the magistrates looked after me as a matter ofpublic policy. (Har.16)54Ac si volumus ea quae de quoque deo nobis tradita sunt recordari, hanc Matrem Magnam,cuius ludi violati, polluti, paene ad caedem et ad funus civitatis conversi sunt, hanc, inquam,accepimus agros et nemora cum quodam strepitu fremituque peragrare.

PC25), and in fact this strivingfor unique distinction was ubiquitous among the Roman aristocracy.6What is striking here is Cicero’s deep but narrow use of exempla toturn what was perhaps merely an exoneration into a signal honor.On the other hand, he contrasts his own return with ones con-ducted by force of arms. In 87–6 B.C., the general Marius made abrief return to power, along with the legal consul Cinna, in an armedcoup.7This is the difference between him and me: that man, as he was bestable, took revenge on his enemies by arms, while I used my custom-ary means of oratory, since that art has its place in war and sedition,mine in peace and quiet. (RP20)8Similarly the threat of Sulla hangs over the speeches.9Sulla, so strong and noble a consul, fought with Marius, our most glo-rious citizen. Each suffered defeat but not without seizing kingly powerin victory. Cinna fought with his colleague Octavius. Good fortunegave each power over the state, bad fortune gave them death. Sullawon again; then without doubt he had regal power, though he res-cued the republic. (Har. 54)10Here, of course, both the method and the point are different thanin the recall examples. Cicero stresses not honor, but his underly-ing service to the state in avoiding the shedding of citizen blood.The good of the state was achieved not in the stereotypically heroicway (by arms and aggression), but by speech and restraint.

Elsewherethis is contrasted with more positive views of Marius, based on his refusal to sup-port the attempted coup of Saturninus and Glaucia (Har. 51, Planc. 88) or on hisbrief exile (Planc. 26).

Moreover, his foils are meant to benegative, not merely lesser. Nonetheless, Cicero uses these exempla,too, to contextualize and spin an event peculiar to himself.So far this could all reasonably be described as the specializedapplication of fairly standard Roman strategies of appealing to thepast. But the past is not merely a context for the post reditumspeeches;for many of them it is their subject matter. In a couple of cases thisis arguably a generic necessity. The speeches of thanksgiving to thesenate and to the people not surprisingly dwell on the circumstancesof Cicero’s exile and, especially, his recall. Yet he could have dweltmore on the extent of his present gratitude or the means by whichhe would show it in the future. The speech on the distribution ofthe consular provinces is a deliberative one and therefore wouldstereotypically be about the future. Large chunks of it, however, dealwith Cicero’s own past and criticism of his old enemies Piso andGabinius (4–14, 18–25). Still more telling is the use of the past inthe forensic speeches from this period and in quasi-forensic speechessuch as those in which he argues about the alleged consecration ofhis house and subsequent omens. The various audiences in thesespeeches ( juries, pontifices, senators) of course sit in judgment overvarious past actions, but Cicero’s arguments tend to go back a stepeven further. That is, he interprets the event in question (say, a pur-ported criminal offense) in terms of other past events, ones even fur-ther in the past. So, for instance, pro Balbogoes on at length aboutPompey’s military career and about grants of citizenship by other,earlier commanders. Pro Sestioand pro Milonetalk about almost noth-ing but the political background to Sestius’ use of gangs and thedeath of Clodius respectively. In fact, it is difficult to tell from proSestioexactly what incident or incidents gave rise to the prosecution.Pro Caeliohinges on the relationship between the defendant andClodia before the alleged offenses.This characteristic can perhaps best be illustrated by looking atde Domo Suaand de Haruspicum Responsis. Both take on religious, andtherefore potentially quite technical, issues. (On this characteristic ofreligious discourse see below.) Yet in both speeches the individualtechnical questions are often ultimately resolved on the grounds ofpast behavior of the various actors. The haruspices had warnedagainst someone sowing dissension and discord among the elite (Har.40). Who could be at fault? After considering some past revolution-aries, such as the Gracchi, he ends on Clodius (41–4).

The others were in the wrong, but atleast driven by understandable, manly considerations. Clodius,fresh from his saffron dress, his turban, his womanly slippers and pur-ple stockings, his bra, his lute, his depravity and debauchery, suddenlyput on the people’s clothes. If he had not been caught, dressed likethis, by women, if he had not been allowed by the maids’ assistanceto slip out of the place he could not rightly enter, the Roman peoplewould lack its champion and the republic such a fine citizen. (Har.44)11That is, Clodius’ (alleged) cross-dressing to enter the rites of the BonaDea in 61 meant he was now the source of the sedition warned ofby the priests.12Similarly in De Domo SuaCicero confronts the ques-tion of whether Clodius had the legal authority to offer a bill autho-rizing the consecration of Cicero’s confiscated property (Dom. 106).Cicero of course argues that he is not. The grounds, however, haveless to do with the law than with, again, Clodius’ supposed impiety(106–9). The confiscation of Cicero’s property was itself contrary tothe sacred character of the home and thus to religion. Therefore,Clodius’ attempted consecration was absurd:13What is more holy, what fortified by greater religious scruple than thehouse of each individual citizen? Here are altars, hearths, householdgods, rites, religous observance and ceremony. This is a refuge sosacred that no one may be snatched away from it. All the more, then,his madness must be repelled from your ears, when he not only broughtdown all the things which our ancestors wanted us to have sacred andsafely protected by religious scruple, but even did so in the very nameof religion. (Dom. 109)14In most of these cases the transition from legal to historical ques-tion is accomplished by an implicit or explicit argument about char-acter. Clodius had done bad things in the past (primarily the violation11...a crocota, a mitra, a muliebribus soleis purpureisque fasceolis, a strophio, a psalterio,a flagitio, a stupro est factus repente popularis.

One isthat it is highly compressed. The other has to do with the relation-ship between the more recent and the more distant past. History iscompressed first in that it is composed almost entirely of three orfour events. The first is the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 B.C.15Thenext is the Bona Dea controversy of 61 B.C.16(Here he does notmention his own involvement as a witness hostile to Clodius.) Thencome the slightly more complex issues of Clodius’ tribunate in 58(also described as the consulship of Piso and Gabinius),17featuringCicero’s exile, and finally Cicero’s recall in the following year. Next,the cast of characters is highly limited. Cicero figures directly in allfour and Clodius in two. Catiline is the only other major figure.Even Piso and Gabinius, the consuls of 58 who get a significantamount of ‘air time’ themselves, count in the story almost entirelyas facilitators of Clodius activities. (Thematically, they cease to beconsuls or even to be present at all; see below.) Third, there is redun-dancy even with Cicero’s short series. In particular, Clodius’ reignis repeatedly described as a return of the Catilinarian conspiracy.Clodius is made a friend of Catiline’s and himself metaphorically asecond Catiline, and is supported by literally the same dissipated anddisreputable forces.18And allegedly those very supporters identifiedhim as a (more successful) Catiline, felix Catilinain the famous phrase(Dom. 72). In fact, on Cicero’s description, both ‘plots’ were defeatedby the same means: his own authoritative but non-violent intervention:19Twice I saved the republic; as consul and in the toga I conqueredarmed men, as a private citizen I yielded to armed consuls. I haveprofited greatly from both occasions: the first time because I saw thesenate and all the good men in mourning dress for my sake by decree15RS10, 12, 33; RP13; Dom. 61–2, 72, 75; Har. 5, 42–3; Pis. 5, 15–6, 20, 95;Sest. 28, 42.16Pis. 95, Har. 4, 8, 37–9, 44, Dom. 104–5, Mil. 12–13, 86.17Har. 2.18Nisbet (1961): 70 notes that the charge of friendship (Pis. 11, 16, Har. 5), atleast, was probably unfair on any interpretation.

(Dom. 99)20The redundancy is one way of creating a common Ciceronian effectknown as ‘resonance.’ This is the repetition of a proposition, image,or argument, which makes each individual occurrence more credibleby virtue of familiarity.21The repetition of his interpretation of eachevent makes it more common-sensical; the close parallels betweenthe two mean that they reinforce each other as well.Cicero needed to control the interpretation of these events for atleast two reasons. They were in fact controversial. When Cicero lefthis consulship he was prevented by a tribune from giving the cus-tomary end-of-term speech because of his execution without trial ofRoman citizens in the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy.22He apparently faced charges of ‘cruelty’ and illegality in this con-nection for several years until Clodius was able to force his exile in58. Thus Cicero was concerned with the legitimacy of his originalaction, which was after all his main claim to civic glory, and thedelegitimization of his opponents’ successes. And even if Cicero’sgeneral line were to be accepted, there was still a question of howimportant it was. He was constantly anxious about his standing rel-ative to, for instance, Pompey, whose claims to fame rested on theabsolutely solid foundation of military victories. Cicero needed toturn the relative lack of military action in his successes from a signthat they were minor (compare the principle that a military triumphrequired a minimum number of enemy casualties) into an extrabenefit (compare the corona civicagiven to soldiers for saving the lifeof a fellow citizen).The use of schematization to control interpretation of the past isnot peculiar to Cicero, and it leads to the final point of this section.20Bis servavi <rem publicam>, qui consul togatus armatos vicerim, privatus consulibus arma-tis cesserim. Vtriusque temporis fructum tuli maximum: superioris, quod ex senatus auctoritate etsenatum et omnis bonos meae salutis causa mutata veste vidi, posterioris, quod et senatus et popu-lus Romanus et omnes mortales et privatim et publice iudicarunt sine meo reditu rem publicamsalvam esse non posse.21For the notion of ‘resonance’ see C.

Valerius takes incidents froma variety of sources and decontextualizes them. He commonly takesthem from a narrative stream and turns them into anecdotes. Hesystematically removes them from their local political contexts andputs them into transhistorical ethical categories. He selects only cer-tain events from the whole of Roman history. And finally he reducescollective and structural events to the acts (or conflicts) of individu-als. Thus digested, history becomes rhetorically more useful becauseit broadly applicable (based on its decontextualization) and easilycontrolled (since the moral of each story is already built in). Thatthis is not Valerius’ peculiar strategy is illustrated by Cicero’s use ofexempla from the relatively distant past. Regulus returning himselfto his Carthaginian captors for torture stands for the value of sacrificingoneself for the community (Pis. 43, Sest. 127).24Tiberius Gracchus(father of the famous tribune) is a model for sacrificing personalenmity for the sake of the public good (PC18).25The striking thingabout these speeches, then, is Cicero’s attempt to convert the recent,political past into the exemplary form of the more distant past. Themoves he makes must already have existed as generic (that is, char-acteristic of a genre) strategies, but he uses them as political tactics.(Unfortunately, the lack of good comparanda from this or earlierperiods makes it hard to tell how novel the conversion was.)Counter-HistoryAs I noted above, Cicero’s recall from exile is one of the key eventsin Cicero’s Roman history. It is all the more striking, then, that theexile itself is not such an event. Of course, Cicero does not entirelydeny it. He does need somewhere whence to return. And in Pro23Valerius Maximus and the Rhetoric of the New Nobility(Chapel Hill: University ofNorth Carolina Press 1992): 19, 147–229.24See A. Dyck, A Commentary on Cicero, De Officiis(Ann Arbor: University ofMichigan Press 1996): 622–626 for versions of the story. The exemplary versionhere ignores the conflict between loyalty to country and obligation to the truth, aswell as the facts of the contemporary military situation.25Cicero naturally does not consider the possibility that it might have been inGracchus’ interests to maintain some relationship with the Scipios, the most promi-nent family of the day. POST REDITUM167MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 167"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Plancioand the two speeches of thanksgiving he goes into his sufferingsin some detail so as to explain his gratitude to those (like Plancius)who had supported him while he was away. But Cicero also wagesa campaign on several different levels to deny the characterizationof this happening as an exile. The first level is the lexical. So, forinstance, in the speech on his house he inquires of Clodius:Did you, unholy plague, dare to call this man an exile when you wereknown for such great crimes and corruption that you turned everyplace you went into a place of exile? What, after all, is an exile? Thename itself signifies a disaster not disgrace. When, then, is it foul?When it is a punishment for a crime or at least, in popular opinion,for a convict. So did I incur the name by a crime or by a convic-tion? (Dom. 72)26He then goes on to deny that either of these conditions obtained.While the word is not used again of Cicero, the conclusion is clear:Cicero was never in fact in exile. Moreover, this passage is unusualfor even raising the issue explicitly. Robinson27has noted Cicero’salmost pathological avoidance of the word exile, even in his privatecorrespondence, after his return. Thus Cicero speaks frequently ofhis ‘return’ (reditus), but what he returns from is euphemized withterms such as calamitas. Over the course of several speeches, the fail-ure of parallelism becomes quite striking.A second level of denial has to do with the technical, legal valid-ity of the exile. Cicero has a number of arguments to make on thisscore. He repeatedly points out that he was never tried by an appro-priate body, never given a chance to defend himself (Dom. 43, 62,77; RS8). The relevant law passed by the people apparently assertedthat Cicero had already been exiled, not that he was to be exiled(Dom. 47); this both highlighted the lack of a trial, and, he argues,meant that the decree itself could not be the legal basis for his exile.And, aside from interpreting the text of the law, he suggests thatthe circumstances of its passage rendered it invalid: Clodius’ transi-tio ad plebem(and thus his tribunician legislation) were improper, the26Hunc tu etiam, portentosa pestis, exsulem appellare ausus es, cum tantis sceleribus esses etflagitiis notatus ut omnem locum quo adisses exsili simillimum redderes?

Vtrum igitur peccato meo nomensubeo an re iudicata?27“Cicero’s References to his Banishment,” Classical World87 (1994): 475–480.168 . MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 168"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"law was a privilegium(bill of attainder), it was passed against the lawsallowing religious obstruction, it was carried by means of violence.28Cicero seems not to have been alone in this strategy. One ally,Lucius Cotta, seems to have gone one step further and suggestedthat Cicero should not be formally recalled by law on the groundsthat it might legitimize the illegitimate exile (Dom. 68, Sest. 73). Thisstrategy was probably not legally safe for Cicero, and, as we notedabove, he had use for the recall procedure as a unique honor, andif he could eliminate the exile itself, it would be a pure honor. Buthis extensive discussion of the honor does then create precisely theproblem identified by Cotta: return implies something to return from.The third level of denial is more abstract; it deals not with tech-nical validity but with political theory of a sort. Not only were thespecific bills dealing with Cicero invalid, it is argued, but the entirestate had collapsed in 58. The senate, the courts, and the consulshad all failed. Or rather, as Cicero frames it, they had ceased toexist: nulla iudicia(RP14), senatum...omnino de civitate esse sublatum;consules...funditus tolleretur(Sest. 42). In sum, Cicero’s salvation andthat of the res publicawere one and the same:29I realized that there was no republic. I believed that there was noplace for me in this city once the republic was destroyed, nor did Idoubt that she would bring me back with herself if she were restored.(RP14)30In light of this line of argument, we may want to reconsider anotherrecurring motif of these speeches. Cicero frequently describes Clodiusand his followers as latrones‘bandits.’31Nisbet (1961:195) lumps thischarge in with other terms like furand rapaxindicating greed. Thereis certainly something to this, and avaritiais of course a conventionaltopic of invective. But here also seems to be something more goingon here. Habinek32has noted the ideological significance of bandit-language in Cicero’s earlier speeches against Catiline. The charge ofbanditry is not just about theft, but about political delegitimation.28Dom. 33–4, 68; Sest. 73; RS11.29RS36, Sest. 128, Dom. 17.30Rem publicam esse nullam putavi.

Their presence is the flip-side ofthe failure (or in Cicero’s terms the absence) of the institutions ofthe proper state. In this case there is no particular internal contra-diction in Cicero’s claim; rather it is tendentious on its face. Therewas, as far as we can tell, no well articulated Roman discoursearound ‘the state’ or ‘legitimacy.’ Cicero himself arguably began todevelop one around this time (De re publica, De legibus), but that wasboth idiosyncratic and after the fact.In addition to the specific problems of these three lines of argu-ment, there was one defect they shared. If there was no exile, whydid Cicero in fact leave? Here he was caught in a dilemma. If hisdeparture did not suggest the exile were perhaps genuine, then itpointed to cowardice in the face of his enemies. The charge, or refu-tations that make it clear, comes up repeatedly in the speeches.33This was a charge to which Cicero was perhaps particularly vul-nerable since, as we have noted, his reputation even in good timeswas as a speaker, not a warrior. His reply, as we have already alludedto as well, is to frame his departure from Rome as a second instanceof saving the city without bloodshed. For instance,I lifted this violence, this crime, this madness from the necks of all thegood men by interposing my body, and received with my body theentire attack of chaos, the whole force of evil men....However, hadI wished to struggle with force and arms against force (as many bravemen wished), I would either have triumphed with great casualtiesamong evil men (but still citizens) or, after the death of all good men,I would have fallen along with the republic, as they so greatly desired.(Dom. 63)34Had he resisted there would have been much violence; as it wasonly Cicero himself suffered. This was not cowardly flight but ‘tak-ing one for the team.’Why go to all this trouble? Why spend so much time on an obvi-ously problematic series of arguments? This is a complex questionand must be addressed on several different levels. As was suggested33RS6, 34; RP19; Dom. 63–4; Har. 45; Sest. 39, 43.34Hanc ego vim, pontifices, hoc scelus, hunc furorem meo corpore opposito ab omnium bono-rum cervicibus depuli, omnemque impetum discordiarum, omnem diu conlectam vim improbo-rum...excepi meo corpore....Quod si, ut multis fortissimis viris placuit, vi et armis contravim decertare voluissem, aut vicissem cum magna internecione improborum, sed tamen civium, autinterfectis bonis omnibus, quod illis optatissimum erat, una cum re publica concidissem.170 . MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 170"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"above, one of Cicero’s goals was to extract maximum glory fromthe circumstances of his recall. But no matter how extraordinarythose circumstances, it might still have been argued that his recallsimply returned matters to the status quo ante, that it simply can-celed the disgrace of the original exile. If, however, he was never‘really’ in exile, then only the positive honor remained. Thus attimes, Cicero simply tries to make the earlier part go away:I recall these things freely, nor am I even unwilling to pass over whatsome have done to me. I do not have the time to remember theinjuries which, even if I could avenge them, I would prefer to forget.(RS23)35Moreover, if the exile were admitted at all, there is a sense in whichit would not even have been cancelled out by the recall. Disgracewas often for the Romans an objective rather than a subjective mat-ter; compare the permanent stigma on a person who had ever beena slave or qui corpore suo muliebria passus est.36Once an exile alwaysan exile.37(The evident distress in Cicero’s letters from exile suggestthat he had internalized the disgrace. The insistence of these speechesmight equally suggest that he had internalized its objective charac-ter.) This creates another tension, though not strictly a contradic-tion, in his representation of the events of 58. In the passage justquoted from the thanksgiving speech to the senate he tries to erasehis exile. Elsewhere, as when he responds to the charge of cow-ardice, he changes its valence instead:If I defended the republic when it was indebted to me, what shouldI do now when I am greatly indebted to it? What can shake or weakenmy spirit in whose misfortune you see a witness not only to no crime,but rather to divine services to the republic?

This sec-tion will consider how Cicero deals with a phenomenon that was asmuch present as past to him—the political alliance today known asthe first triumvirate. We meet the triumvirs together in a passagefrom Cicero’s defense of Sestius:Those things moved me: in all his public gatherings that Fury shoutedthat he took his actions against my well-being under the guidance ofPompey, a most noteworthy man and very friendly to me now andas long as was possible. Marcus Crassus, a great man and one withwhom I had the closest ties of friendship, was said by that public nui-sance to have been most hostile to my fortunes. Julius Caesar, whoshould not be hostile me on account of anything I have done, wassaid in the same meetings to be extremely hostile to my well-being.(Sest. 39)39(He then goes on to say that, while Clodius’ claims were false, thebehavior of the triumvirs might have allowed some to believe whathe was saying.) Nothing in this passage alludes to an alliance betweenPompey, Crassus, and Caesar. In fact, by spelling out the threepropositions separately (clamabat...praedicabatur...dicebatur), Cicerosuggests that they do not implicate each other. Perhaps even morestriking from a modern point of view is that this is one of only twopassages in the post reditumspeeches in which the three are even listedtogether. (In the other, Pompey and Crassus are arguably linked,39Sed me illa moverunt: omnibus in contionibus illa furia clamabat se quae faceret contrasalutem meam facere auctore Cn. Pompeio, clarissimo viro mihique et nunc et quoad licuit ami-cissimo; M. Crassus, quocum mihi omnes erant amicitiae necessitudines, vir fortissimus, ab eademilla peste infestissimus esse meis fortunis praedicabatur; C.

There is, of course, no inac-curacy here. As many historians have pointed out, the trio had nolegal status and even on an informal level their alliance suffered con-siderable ups and downs.40Still, Cicero was quite attentive to polit-ical friendships and enmities, and this set should have loomedparticularly large. Before considering his treatment of the group fur-ther, it may be useful to analyze how the triumvirs are presentedindividually.One of the clearest distinctions among the three is in the sheerfrequency with which they are mentioned. Caesar comes up roughlythree times as often as Crassus, and Pompey about three times asmuch again.41Even when Crassus is mentioned, he scarcely has anyindependent identity. Frequently, he comes into play as Cicero’s co-counsel or Pompey’s co-consul or political ally.42Elsewhere he isalmost always part of a list. In the most extreme case (Har. 12) heis lumped in with the 18 other priests who had heard the case ofthe alleged consecration of Cicero’s house.43Yet even when Ciceroprovides more individualized detail, Crassus’ rhetorical context is stillessentially that of a list. For instance,Here you are trying to undermine Pompey’s gift or, I should say, hisofficial judgment when he did what he had heard Marius had done,did what he had seen Publius Crassus, Lucius Sulla, Quintus Metellus,Marcus Crassus, and even, in his own home, his own father do. Infact he did not do this in the case of Cornelius alone, for he grantedHasdrubal of Gades citizenship after the war in Africa, and the Mamer-tine Ovii and certain Fabii from Saguntum and Utica.

Gruen, The Last Generation of the Roman Republic(Berkeley: University ofCalifornia Press 1974): 83–120.41These figures discount numerous mentions of Caesar and Pompey in PCandBalb., speeches of which they are properly the topics and so need not reflect theiroverall importance. I have also not counted (though the cases are few enough thatit is not particularly important) instances in which Crassus and Pompey are referredto as co-counsel.42This could possibly be the son of the triumvir instead; Lanaghan (1969): 87–88.43Cael. 18, 23; Balb. 17; Sest. 41.44Hic tu Cn.

Nonetheless, and outside of numerous allusions to Caesar’s suc-cesses as a general, his name tends to come up in three main contexts.The first is Caesar’s relationship with Clodius. In particular, Cicerorepeatedly asserts that Caesar was not, as Clodius had claimed, asupporter of the tribune. Two instances of this are the passagesreferred to above in which Cicero mentions the entire triumvirate(Sest. 39, Har. 47), but he also makes the point about Caesar alone.45There is a small historical irony here. Scholars in the last few decadeshave stressed Clodius’ independence from the triumvirs in generaland Caesar in particular; this is seen as a way of taking him moreseriously.46Clearly, however, when Cicero makes a similar point hisintent is to wound Clodius:If he had not immediately given himself to those whose minds hethought were cut loose from your authority, if our noble authoritywere not lifting them to the sky with praise, if he were not threaten-ing that he would send Caesar’s army into the senate house withweapons drawn (which he couldn’t do, but no one refuted him),. . . couldhe have been so cruel an enemy to me and so criminal an enemy tothe republic? (Har. 47)47Conversely (though sometimes also simultaneously), Cicero insists thathe and Caesar are notenemies. The tone of these passages can bea little strange, since Cicero nearly admits that they are not reallyfriends either.48I will say from the heart what I believe, senators, and what I haveoften said in your hearing.

A fuller accounting appears in PC41:As consul he took actions in which he wished me to participate. If Iwas not entirely in agreement with this agenda, nonetheless I shouldbe flattered by his judgment. He asked me to accept a Vvirate, hewanted me to be among the consulars closest to him, he offered mewhatever legation I should wish with any honors.50Cicero wants at least some of the prestige that accrued to associa-tion with the great man, while not lending any support or admit-ting specific obligation in return.The third context in which Caesar appears is a much more specificone, but it involves a balancing act much like that surroundingCicero’s version of his relationship to the general. Cicero, recall, wasdesperate to argue that he had not been exiled, and one of his strate-gies to do so was to attack the status of the laws passed against him.One version of this argument touched on Caesar. Caesar’s colleagueBibulus had used religious means to obstruct the former’s legislativeduring their consulship in 59. It could be (and in fact was) arguedthat laws passed in the face of this obstruction, such as the oneallowing Clodius’ transition to plebeian status and subsequent elec-tion as tribune, were invalid. If this were so, then Clodius’ legisla-tion against Cicero might in turn be held invalid. The problem withsuch an argument is that it would equally invalidate much more ofCaesar’s legislation, some of which Cicero did not object to (Pis. 37,Sest. 135), and some of which would simply be to hard to undowhether one supported it initially or not.

Both shift the question from technicallegal issues to a broader one of community approval, and this afterall is what worried Cicero about Caesar—whether he could playwithin the system.Pompey is a constant presence in the speeches, and is usuallytreated in even more complementary terms than Caesar. He is notmerely accomplished, but the leading man of the state:The leader in urging and beseeching you was Pompey, the first of allmen of all time in virtue, wisdom, and glory. (RP16)51Pompey, easily the leader in virtue, glory, and deeds, of every age andpeople in all memory. (RS7)52Given this, it is hardly surprising that Cicero stresses his closenesswith Pompey.53What is, then, surprising is a minor theme, but onerepeated in six of the speeches. In these Cicero alludes to an eventof the year 58. A slave of Clodius ostentatiously dropped a daggerin Pompey’s presence. For some time thereafter Pompey shut him-self up in his house out of fear of assassination.54When Cicero brings51Quorum princeps ad cohortandos vos et ad rogandos fuit Cn. Pompeius, vir omnium quisunt, fuerunt, erunt, virtute sapientia gloria princeps.52...virtute gloria rebus gestis Cn. Pompeius omnium gentium, omnium saeclorum, omnismemoriae facile princeps...53RP16, 18; RS5, 29; Dom. 3, 27, 69; Har. 46; Sest. 74, 107, 133.54It has been plausibly suggested that Pompey’s reaction may have been morestrategic than the ancient sources suggest; he may have wanted his absence to under-176 . MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 176"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"this up it is ostensibly to attack Clodius. Anyone who would attemptto deprive the state of its leading man is clearly hostile to the stateitself:A slave of Clodius was taken in the temple of Castor, whom Clodiushad placed there to kill Pompey. A dagger was taken from his handsand he confessed. Thereafter the forum, the senate, and the peoplehad to do without Pompey. He defended himself with his walls anddoor, not by recourse to law and the courts. (Mil. 18)55In isolation, this argument makes sense, especially if one acceptsCicero’s standing premise of Pompey’s centrality to the state. Butobviously the cowardice imputed to Pompey runs against the grainof Cicero’s usual practice and threatens to offend the figure in whomCicero placed his political hopes the most. In part Cicero may sim-ply be expressing hostility for Pompey’s failure to protect him fromClodius in 58. In part there may be strategic moves even here. Ifeven Pompey retreated in the face of a personal threat, then Cicero’sdeparture in the face of an ‘illegal’ exile could hardly be held againsthim. Moreover, it makes Cicero’s direct, personal response to theCatilinarian conspiracy look that much braver.56We can now turn to the question of Cicero’s representation ofthe triumvirate as a whole. I want to address two aspects of Cicero’sapproach—one directly connected to this representational issue andone indirectly. Cicero’s letters convey considerable respect for Caesar’stalents, but little faith in his adherence to (Cicero’s version of ) repub-lican principles.57In the speeches Caesar is praised both for his skillsand his politics. Praise for the latter, however, is framed largely innegative terms. He was not one of the promoters of Cicero’s exile,but went along with it. He was not, as Clodius had argued, a prin-cipled supporter of the original expulsion. And when he did the rightthing it was because his good will towards the republic forced himto act in a way he might not himself have preferred. I suggestedscore his value to the state. See B. Marshall, “Pompeius’ Fear of Assassination,”Chiron17 (1987): 119–133.55Comprehensus est in templo Castoris servus P. Clodi, quem ille ad Cn. Pompeium interficiendumconlocarat.

Arguably thisis true of Cicero’s treatment of Caesar in general. He describes notso much the Caesar he knew, but the one he preferred. In this case,Caesar was an acknowledged leader abroad, but was largely neu-tralized in politics at Rome. Cicero uses a similar approach toPompey. Pompey’s preeminence is hardly Cicero’s invention, but hiscommitment to the defense of Cicero and Ciceronian Republicanism(or indeed anything outside himself ) was never very clear.58In fact,the treatment of the triumvirate as a whole arguably follows thesame pattern. That is, Cicero does not so much represent it as hesaw it, as perform a version that he desired. It is split into its com-ponent parts, restoring the characteristic fluidity of Roman factionalpolitics. Cicero himself is important to this scheme. He is distancedfrom Caesar, but close to Pompey; alliance to Cicero wedges hispurported non-enemy and close ally apart. And, of course, Cicero’sindividual importance is increased if he is central to definition ofpolitical alignment.Cicero’s negotiation of his relationship to the triumvirs is alsoaffected by his response to a more personal challenge to his author-ity. As is well known, the effectiveness of a Roman public speakerdepended not only on specific knowledge and oratorical skill, butalso to a great degree, personal authority.59For this reason Cicerocould attack an opposing advocate because he had (allegedly) beenpaid (Rosc. 55); they could not therefore bring independent author-ity to bear on the case. In the defense of Plancius, Cicero arguesthat the defendant was a close ally of his, while the prosecutor sug-gested that Plancius had not been particularly helpful to Cicero (Planc.77). This is the reverse of modern claims to objectivity as the basisof the advocate’s credibility. Dependency is also a standard criticismto level against a witness’ credibility.60Cicero’s technical skills hadnot declined in his exile, but political circumstances brought hisauthority into question. On his return he was compelled by the tri-umvirs to take certain cases (and probably to decline others). The58R.

Cicero could well have thought it best asa matter of policy to keep Caesar in command of Gaul in 55, buthe could still be accused of submission to his ‘enemy’ Caesar (PC44–6). Cicero, then, needs to treat his associates in one of two ways.Pompey, and the numerous minor allies that he defended through-out the post reditumperiod, were really friends and allies; Cicero’spatronage of them was therefore an extension of his previous char-acter and a sign of constancy.62This will not work for Caesar, fromwhom Cicero must insist on some distance. Thus Cicero tends toput himself and Caesar on the same level, either compromising theirown interests for those of the state (PC47, Planc. 93), or to empha-sizing Caesar’s own courting of himself (PC43, Pis. 79).Praise and BlameHeretofore we have been considering primarily narrative aspects ofthe post reditumspeeches: how did Cicero attempt to shape the audi-ence’s understanding of the flow of events from approximately 63to his present? There are, of course, other dimensions to Cicero’sperformances as well. One of these is more explicitly evaluative;Cicero devotes considerable time to the praise and blame of a vari-ety of individuals. Corbeill discusses the topics and functions of in-vective oratory.63Standard issues include not only character butappearance, descent, and name. Criticism was sometimes tailored tospecific individuals in ways that suggest that it was provoked byspecifics of their behavior (though not necessarily therefore reliableby modern standards). Thus in Cicero’s versions Piso is openly deca-dent, while his co-consul Gabinius hid his corruption. More often,61Att. 4.5.1 and Shackleton Bailey ad loc. on potential identifications of the textin question.62A.

Handbookcharges are traded and repeated almost at random. The mere mak-ing of the charge was an injury to the dignity of the target.64Furthermore, the competition for honor seems to have been essen-tially zero-sum; the standard response to invective was not refuta-tion but counter-attack. The mechanics of praise are slightly different,but the topics are the same as for blame: character, achievements,descent, etc.65Most characteristically such praise was dispensed infuneral eulogies (laudationes), but might also appear in characterendorsements at trial (Mur., Scaur.) or something like Cicero’s speechpraising Pompey so as to justify granting him an extraordinary com-mand in the east (Leg. Man.).Rhetorical theory recognized speeches of praise and blame as oneof the three genres of oratory, along with forensic and deliberativespeaking. Sometimes evaluation does form a stand-alone category ofspeeches. Corbeill66treats In Pisonemand In Vatiniumfrom this periodas formal invective. On the other side, Cicero’s speeches of thanks-giving to the Senate and people consist almost entirely of praise fora range of persons. The speech on the consular provinces doesaddress general deliberative concerns, but much of it also consists ofpraise of Caesar’s prowess. Even outside of the set pieces, however,the post reditumspeeches are full of incidental praise and blame. (Inthis respect they are not particularly distinct from speeches of otherperiods.) Consider, for instance, the defense of Sestius.67Sestius wason trial for seditious violence during the year 58. Cicero’s strategyis essentially to admit the violence, but deny the sedition. As notedabove, Cicero developed a theory of the failure or even absence ofthe state during that year, due to the corruption of its magistrates.Useful for Cicero’s own needs, this theory also helped Sestius’ case.Matters had degenerated to the point that politics as usual could nolonger be expected to work; force (on the part of antisocial forces)had to be met with force by theboni(Sest. 92). Part of this argu-ment is made by means of an extended attack on the consuls Gabiniusand Piso (Sest. 18–24):64A. Riggsby, “Did the Romans Believe in their Verdicts?,” Rhetorica15 (1997):247–8.65See A.

(Sest.18, 22)68Most of this is not relevant to the argument, at least not in a nar-row sense. Rather, in typical Roman fashion, it seeks to establishthat Piso and Gabinius are the sort of people (immoral in a verygeneral sense) who would incline to the kind of political misbehav-ior that Cicero accuses them of. In his defense of Caelius Cicerorepeatedly suggests (and occasionally simply states) that the chiefdefense witness was a virtual prostitute so as to discredit her.69Inaddition to the violation of the rites of Bona Dea, De Domo Suaaccuses Clodius of effeminacy and incest and other sexual impro-prieties.70Entire ethnic groups are attacked to undercut witness tes-timony (Scaur. 42–5, Rab. Post. 34–6). After his death Clodius is stilla virtual tyrant and a madman (Mil. 80, 88). His individual crimestake a full section of the speech to list in the barest detail (Mil. 87).The ethical characterizations in these speeches are highly polar-ized. Virtually everyone mentioned is either entirely virtuous orentirely corrupt. There is also an interesting set of occasional excep-tions that proves the rule:71Tiberius Gracchus was pained by hostility toward the Numantine treaty(in which he had been involved as quaestor to Mancinus) and the sen-ate’s severity in undercutting it, and this affair forced that brave andnoble man to slide away from the authority of the senate. A brother’sdeath, piety, pain, a great soul stirred Gaius Gracchus to seek redressfor the blood of his house.... In these cases the cause was not just(for there can be no just cause for doing injury to the republic), but68Alter unguentis adfluens, calamistrata coma, despiciens conscios stuprorum ac veteres vexa-tores aetatulae suae, puteali et faeneratorum gregibus inflatus....Nequam esse hominem et levemet falsa opinione hominum ab adulescentia commendatum sciebam; etenim animus eius vultu, flagitiaparietibus tegebantur.69C.

Clodius,fresh from his saffron dress, his turban...suddenly put on the peo-ple’s clothes. (Har. 43–4)72The Gracchi acted unjustly, but not in an unmanly fashion; Clodiusdid both. There is then, an ethical hierarchy. But when this situa-tion arises, the foil is always in the past. The present comparandumshows undiluted evil.73In a similar way, Cicero emphasizes his ownservice to the state and consequent honors not by comparison tocontemporary figures, but ones from the past, as we have seen above.Even Caesar can be praised in the highest terms, but it is clear thathis contribution was simply failing to obstruct his return from exile:Jurors, at this time Sestius made the journey to Caesar on behalf ofmy well-being. He thought it relevant to the harmony of the citizenryand the chances of success that Caesar’s mind was not unsympatheticto the cause. (Sest71).74ConsensusBefore treating some contextual issues, I want to treat one morerepeated thematic element of the speeches. This is consensus, andit takes two distinct forms: ideal and actual. In the former usage,consensus is an ideal for the state. One of the warnings of the harus-pices was against optimatium discordiam dissensionemque(Har.40). Formost of their warnings, Cicero gives simply an interpretation, show-ing that they point to Clodius and not to himself. In the case ofdiscord, however, he goes on at some length to explain why theproblem is a problem (Har. 40–2). Elsewhere he defines the failedstate of the republic as dissension; the return of Cicero and the72Nam Ti. Graccho invidia Numantini foederis, cui feriendo, quaestor C.

The most important potential division, how-ever, is between the upper and lower orders of society. In a famouspassage of the defense of Sestius, Cicero claims:There have always been two segments in this community among thosewho spend their time administering the state and conducting them-selves well in this sphere. Of these two, some have always wanted toseem and be ‘popular’, the others ‘the best men.’ Those who wishedwhat they did and said to be popular with the masses are the popu-lares, those who conduct themselves so that their plans be acceptableto the best people are judged optimates. (Sest. 96)77However, every time he discusses this distinction at any length hedoes so to collapse it. The normal argument is that, even thoughCicero does not pander to the people, he has their interests at heart.Thus he is both one of the optimatesand the true popularis.78Or hewill attack a soi-disant popularisfor tearing the people away from theirbetters without actually looking after their interests.79This is an oldargument for Cicero and it responds to a long-standing problem.Cicero’s most emphatic claim to popularisstatus was in the speechto the people against Rullus’ agrarian law (Leg. Agr. 2.7–10). In asociety which balanced elite control of the executive with popularlegislative assemblies, the rhetoric of popular unity was necessary forthe practical purposes of the aristocracy.80(It may well have beenpsychologically useful for them as well, as a means of legitimatingtheir domination.)75E.g. RS27, Dom. 17, Sest. 99.76Sest86 and Scaur. 21, 38 allude to alleged conspiracies.77Duo genera semper in hac civitate fuerunt eorum qui versari in re publica atque in ea seexcellentius gerere studuerunt; quibus ex generibus alteri se popularis, alteri optimates et haberi etesse voluerunt.

In this context the usage is specific to the period.Cicero asserts the unanimity of the forces behind his recall. Againthere is a variety of groups: the magistrates, the Senate, the citi-zenry, Italy, even the world:81For why should I recall those divine and immortal decrees of the townsand colonies and all Italy, on which steps I seem not only to havereturned to Italy but to have ascended to heaven? Everyone knowsthat the Campus Martius was never so full at any vote with such acrowd or so great a splendor of every class, age, and rank of men.Forget the assessment and consensus of all states, nations, provinces,kings, and the world at large as to my services to humanity; what kindof approach and entrance to the city did I have? (Dom. 75)82Obviously, more is better. The breadth of Cicero’s support enhanceshis honor, and the general considerations of the preceding paragraphcould apply here as well. But unanimity may have a particular pointhere. If virtually everyone were on Cicero’s side (only Clodius anda few close relatives and allies are admitted as exceptions), then hecould not ‘really’ have been exiled in the first place; there wouldhave been no one to support it. (Naturally, Cicero does not discusswhat became of Clodius’ ‘hired’ forces when it came time to voteon the recall.)ReligionWhile the conjunction is probably accidental, the post reditumspeechesnonetheless raise a number of religious issues. Here I want to notethree such issues and suggest that all illustrate certain tensions builtinto Roman notions of the relationship between the human and thedivine. The first question arises most clearly in a passage from speechon the report of the haruspices. Early in that text Cicero lists thepontifices who had joined the opinion that his house could be rebuilt81RP18; RS38; Pis. 51–52; Mil. 39.82Nam quid ego illa divina atque immortalia municipiorum et coloniarum et totius Italiae dec-reta commemorem, quibus tamquam gradibus mihi videor in caelum ascendisse, non solum inpatriam revertisse?...Constat enim nullis umquam comitiis campum Martium tanta celebritate,tanto splendore omnis generis hominum aetatum ordinum floruisse.

This,he goes on to claim, was the largest group of pontifices ever to ruleon any question. Somewhat surprisingly, he then immediately ques-tions whether such numbers are actually relevant to his case:In the determination of criminal liability it is important that there beas many present as possible (and in fact the pontiff’s job of interpre-tation can cross over into the power of judges), and the explanationof religious scruple can rightly be carried out even by a single, learnedpontiff(which, admittedly, would be harsh and unjust in a court oflaw), you will find, nonetheless, that more pontifices have sat in judg-ment about my house than ever about the rites of the Vestal Virgins.(Har. 13)83Often in Cicero’s speeches this kind of deliberate ambivalence is sim-ply a device to have something both ways. Here, however, he neverreally lays claim to the support of the ‘one learned pontifex’; somedoubt remains. This passage illustrates two features of the Romanreligious system pointed out by Beard.84One is that the pontifices werehardly ‘priests’ in the conventional modern sense of that term. Theydid not conduct rites or facilitate communication between the humanand the divine. Rather, they were experts, within the human world,in a branch of law that was only in the last instance divine.85If onestresses the ‘religious’ part of ‘religious law,’ then it should not besubject to human intervention. So, for instance, the various categoriesof sacred land were removed from human commerce.86Cicero claimshe cannot even discuss pontifical law with its authorized interpreters(Dom. 33), a reticence he never shows in respect of civil law. But ifone stresses ‘law,’ then the situation is different. While Roman juristsmaintained a notional distinction between law-making and legal inter-pretation, it was quite clear to everyone that what the interpretersdid affected the law. Hence the uncertainty in Cicero’s position.The particular role of the pontifices is an element of a larger issuealso illustrated by this passage and by De Haruspicum Responsisand83Quamquam ad facinoris disquisitionem interest adesse quam plurimos (ita est enim inter-pretatio illa pontificum, ut eidem potestatem habeant iudicum), religionis explanatio vel ab unopontifice perito recte fieri potest (quod idem in iudicio capitis durum atque iniquum est), tamen sicreperietis, frequentiores pontifices de mea domo quam umquam de caerimoniis virginum iudicasse.84“Priesthood in the Roman Republic,” in M.

This is the deferral of authority characteris-tic of Roman religious institutions. The Senate often had the literallast word, but (aside from the question of the formal status of sen-atus consulta in general) it often decided religious matters by com-missioning one or more of the priestly colleges to consider mattersand report back to them. Moreover, the Senate was not a unifiedbody nor a source of positive, day-to-day direction. Individual priestsand colleges (and magistrates) carried on most religious activity with-out much direction or supervision. The case of Cicero’s house is anexcellent illustration of this deferral.87The senate took up the ques-tion, referred it to the pontifices, who reported back, and then finallydecided in Cicero’s favor. Nor was this the end of the matter. Clodiuscould still attack Cicero by way of the haruspices’ finding that locasacra et religiosa profana haberi(Har. 9). Cicero responded that the ref-erence was not to his house and in fact, because of the intensivescrutiny in the earlier case, his house was the only structure in Romanthat could not be suspected of religious difficulties (Har. 11). Laterhe frames this claim slightly (probably accidently) differently, but ina way that may be nearer the truth:There are many houses in this city, Senators, and perhaps most ofthem held under good title, but as a matter of private law, the lawof inheritance, warranty, conveyence, and personal obligation. I denythat there is any other house defended not only by the same privatelaw as those but also by all public law, both human and divine. (Har. 14)88His claim may be the best, but need not be unassailable. Institution-ally, Cicero cannot appeal to religious hierarchy to preempt Clodius’appeal to the haruspices. And it was possible that the Senate orpontifices could have changed their minds on the basis of this newevidence or because a new issue had been raised. There is no insti-tutional way to reach an unchallengable decision.

Religious law would always be allowed the same ambi-guity as human law.89Another religious aspect of several of the speeches has to do withCicero’s quarrel with Clodius over the Aelian and Fufian laws.Immediately on taking office, Clodius offered and eventually passedthree political reforms.90One removed limits on (potentially) politi-cal associations called collegia, a second restricted the censors’ rightto expel unilaterally members of the Senate, and a third limited (inways that are not entirely clear) the practice of obnuntiatioestablishedby the leges Aeliaand/or Fufia. These laws, of the middle second cen-tury B.C., allowed many magistrates to obstruct public business byannouncing they were watching the sky for signs (perhaps on thetheory that they could always find adverse omens if they wantedthem). Cicero has little to say about the collegiaand somewhat moreabout the censorship, but what really disturbs him is the abrogation(as he styles it) of the leges Aeliaand Fufia. Five of the post reditumspeeches attack Piso for this law.91Obnuntiatiowas explicitly designedto protect the Roman state from acting against the will of the gods.92In the speeches Cicero connects it to other legal institutions thatmay or may not have been legally implicated: the auspices and thedies fastiof the calendar. Piso is described as a ‘prodigy and por-tent’ for his laws against the procedure (Pis. 9). Certainly Cicero was happy to invoke divine hostility to Clodius in other contexts.93One might, therefore, reasonably expect a specifically religious argu-ment in defense of obnuntiatio. There is none. Rather Cicero praisesthe laws as a brake on legislation, and particularly on potentiallyradical tribunes: lex Aelia et Fufia...quae nostri maiores certissima sub-sidia rei publicae contra tribunicios furores esse voluerunt(RS11).94It might89It is unlikely, of course, that any human-administered system could avoid thisentirely, but Roman religious law is more obviously an open system.90Asconius 8.12–9.2C; cf.

It is a common Roman assumption that thegods are interested in human political issues,95but Cicero still skipsa step. How can a particular measure can be known to defend thoseinterests? Again, there is no interest in theorizing the relationshipbetween divine will or divine rules and their human application.This lack of theorization appears in reverse fashion in anothercontext. When Cicero talks about his recall and Clodius’ purportedmadness he offers both human and divine causation—what is called‘double determination’ in the context of epic. In the first section ofCicero’s speech of thanksgiving to the people, delivered on his return,he says beneficio divino immortalique vestro maxime laetor. The phrase itselfand numerous parallels suggest that the ‘divinity’ in question ismetaphorical and exaggerated. In fact, outside of a few fixed phrases,the word divinusin these speeches is almost always applied to Cicero’shuman allies and their virtues.96Yet the gods cannot be removedentirely. The whole sentence reads as follows:I rejoice that my offer of myself was accepted by the judgment of theimmortal gods, by the testimony of the senate, by the consensus ofItaly, by the confession of my enemies, and by your divine and immor-tal favor. (RP1)97The gods were involved after all, though unlike the other parties itis not clear just what their contribution was. Elsewhere, divine andhuman causation are more explicitly layered (though their relation-ship is no more clearly articulated):The immortal gods gave me children; you have returned them to me.I have achieved many of my other hopes through the immortal gods;if I had not had your good will, I would lack the enjoyment of allthis divine gifts.

The metaphori-cal usage (for which see TLL1624.11–1625.7) is perhaps a special favorite of Cicero’s,but is hardly unique to him.97Eius devotionis me esse convictum iudicio deorum immortalium, testimonio senatus, consensuItaliae, confessione inimicorum, beneficio divino immortalique vestro maxime laetor.98Di immortales mihi liberos dederunt, vos reddidistis.

Note that they are not separate parts of a single chain (a con-struct Cicero does occasionally employ99). Nor are they thanked, inChristian fashion, for giving strength or wisdom or the like. Theyare credited with the same thing as the human actors. A slightlydifferent disjunction occurs in Cicero’s defense of Milo:The very force which has often brought incredible fortune and wealthto this city removed and extinguished that danger. First it made himof a mind to dare to use force and arms against our bravest man andto be conquered by the man whom, if he had won instead, he wouldhave had impunity and license thereafter. That was not acheived byhuman planning, nor even by modest concern on the part of theimmortal gods. (Mil. 84)100In the very same sentence Cicero asserts that Clodius attacked Milobecause the gods had driven him mad and that he had a very rationalreason for doing so: Milo was the only thing between him and unlim-ited power. Cicero even makes the same pair of assertions again afew sections later (87–88). Literally this could be taken as a contra-diction. Read a little more loosely, Cicero may not be distinguishingcarefully between cause and effect; Clodius’ audacity is both his crimeand its divine penalty. In either case Cicero has no particular theoryof divine causation and in fact tells stories which resist theorization.101Crime and PoliticsSeven of the speeches from the period are defenses in the criminalcourts (iudicia publica). In four of those cases (and one other now99Mil. 44, PC34, Har. 6.100Ea vis igitur ipsa quae saepe incredibilis huic urbi felicitates atque opes attulit illam per-niciem exstinxit ac sustulit, cui primum mentem iniecit ut vi inritare ferroque lacessere fortissimumvirum auderet vincereturque ab eo quem si vicisset habiturus esset impunitatem et licentiam sem-piternam. Non est humano consilio, ne mediocri quidem, iudices, deorum immortalium cura resilla perfecta.101The same passages also illustrate another type of detachment from the work-ings of the divine. In ancient cult contexts, human obligations to specific gods arequite clear, but (as D. Feeny, Literature and Religion at Rome: Cultures, Contexts, andBeliefs[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1998]: 81–82 points out for Rome),divine contributions to humans are almost never individualized. True to this pat-tern, Cicero thanks ‘the immortal gods’ generically throughout the post reditumspeeches. POST REDITUM189MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 189"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"known only from a reference in a surviving speech) Cicero’s strat-egy ties the defense to broader issues of the politics of the period.102This would hardly be surprising on the common assumption thatthe courts were simply another venue for political competition.(Curiously, this assumption has been somewhat discounted in pre-cisely these cases. Cicero is accused of unecessarily making themabout himself.) But, as I have argued elsewhere, the ‘political’ char-acter of the courts deserves much more detailed cooperation. Now,in one very superficial way the courts clearly were a tool for aris-tocrats to settle political scores. In the absence of a state prosecu-tor, accusations were naturally leveled by defendants’ political enemies.In the case of many of Cicero’s post reditumdefenses there is indi-rect evidence for this. Four of the defendants—Milo, Sestius, Cispius,and Plancius—were among those listed in the speeches of thanks-giving.103There is no evidence that any of these prosecutions wereundertaken in bad faith, but the coincidence is perhaps suspect. Andit is certainly plausible that Cicero might have believed that his sup-porters, more precisely those who lacked a strong, independent socialposition, were the subject of a political attack.That said, the ‘political’ aspects of the criminal defenses are quitevaried. In Pro PlancioCicero emphasizes the defendant’s services tohim while he was in exile and his own concomitant gratitude. Thisdoes point to the world outside the law, but it does so neither outof self-absorption nor a attempt to subvert law by politics. Cicerogoes on to say that he would do as much for Plancius as for hisown brother or other family member since it is through Planciusthat he now has enjoyment of the others (Planc. 69).104Cicero’s debtto Plancius implicates the latter in the economy of gratiaand beneficium,not that of money. Cicero has constructed this economy more gen-erally as the very framework of aristocratic society. In fact, weavingPlancius into the social fabric in this way seems to be the primarygoal of much of the speech. References to Cicero’s relationship withhis own family (69), and to Plancius’ with his family (29), with hisneighbors (19–22), and with his superiors (27–8),105fill out a picture102Planc. 75–6 refers to the trial of Cispius (TLRR279).103RS19–21, 30, 35; RP15. See TLRR309, 271, 279, and 293 respectively.104This claim, too, appears immediately on his return from exile: RS2, RP5.105Note particularly: L. vero Apuleio hunc tanti facit ut morem illum maiorum qui prae-scribit in parentum loco quaestoribus suis praetores esse oportere officiis benivolentiaque superarit(Planc. 28).190 . MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 190"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"of Plancius woven into all the canonical structures of society. It canbe shown that a concern for socially proper forms of exchange isprecisely what the charge of ambitusis about.106Cicero’s exile gavePlancius the opportunity to display this concern, but the circum-stances of the exile are not really salient. Hence, Cicero does notgo into his standard account of why he had been exiled.In Pro Sestiothe rhetoric of political alignment is in the forefront.While allusions to other recent trials in Cicero’s speech repeatedlyhint that political affiliation should be given judicial significance, thefamous discussion of the ‘tribe of optimates’ (natio optimatium, 96–132)explicitly gives the reasoning which might support such a position.Vis, for which Sestius was being tried, was a criminal offense onlyif it were contra rem publicam. But the notional opposite, acting pro republica,could have two senses. One is to act for the common good;the other is to act on behalf of the common will. On Cicero’s account,Sestius has, of course, been doing both.107This, not denial of fac-tual allegations, is Cicero’s defense:My intent is to show that all of Sestius’ designs and the plan of hiswhole tribunate was this: to heal (insofar as possible) a wounded andfailing republic....Since he used up the whole force of his tribunatein defense of my well-being, it is necessary that my own past causebe mixed up in this man’s present defense. (Sest. 31)108Thus the definition of the offense not only allows, but virtually demandspolitical arguments. Though it involves some unique peculiarities,the speech for Milo makes similar arguments. After a long argumentthat Milo acted in self-defense in the brawl which resulted in Clodius’death, Cicero turns around and expresses the wish that his clientcould take credit for the other’s death: De qua[sc. morte Clodi] si iamnollem ita diluere crimen ut dilui, tamen impune Miloni palam clamare ac men-tiri gloriiose liceret ‘Occidi, occidi(Mil. 72).’ Both speeches defend againsta charge of vis, and both are political in the crudest sense. Cicero106Riggsby (1999): 21–27, 44–49.107In fact Cicero generally introduces this distinction only to transcend popularisself-definition by narrowing it (Off. 1.85) or collapsing it into ‘optimate’ (here andLA2.6–10).108Mihi autem hoc propositum est ostendere, omnia consilia P. Sesti mentemque totius tri-bunatus hanc fuisse, ut adflictae et perditae rei publicae quantum posset mederetur...qui cumomnem vim sui tribunatus in mea salute consumpserit, necesse est meam causam praeteriti tem-poris cum huius praesenti defensione esse coniunctam. POST REDITUM191MAY_f7_159-195 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 191"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"claims his clients should be acquitted merely because they were onthe right side.In Pro BalboCicero defends a henchman of Caesar’s who hadbeen granted citizenship by Pompey from a charge that the grantwas illegal for technical reasons. Cicero hitches his defense to Pompey’spolitical preeminence. Throughout he stresses that it would be incred-ible for Pompey to go wrong on such a matter, and he complains:For these reasons he was given citizenship by Pompey. The accuserdoes not deny this, but criticizes, so that in Cornelius [Balbus’] casehe approves of the cause, but objects to the penalty; in Pompey’s heobjects to the cause, but sets no penalty except to his reputation. Thusthey wish both the fortunes of an innocent man and the act of ourforemost general to be condemned. Cornelius’ life and Pompey’s actare called into court. (Balb. 6)109The opposition apparently anticipated this argument, claiming thatPompey had acted unknowingly and so was not to blame (Balb. 14).Excusing Pompey thus may have been disingenuous (Pompey, alongwith Caesar, may have been an indirect target of the prosecution).Nonetheless, it suggests there was considerable force to Cicero’s argu-ment. Here the political connection has less to do with political phi-losophy or broad questions of political alignment, than with thepopularity of a single individual. Moreover, the logic of the overtargument is not political in the sense that Pro Sestioand Pro Miloneare. Cicero’s claim is that Pompey was too expert to have gonewrong in such a matter.The other defenses, those of Scaurus, Caelius, and RabiriusPostumus, appear not to touch on political issues. In fact, Pro Caeliomay discount an actual political motivation of the prosecution fortactical reasons. Only some cases have a personal political content(as opposed to motivation). The offense charged is crucial here. AcrossCicero’s career, defenses to charges of repetundae(such as those ofScaurus and Rabirius) tend to be apolitical. The same is true forambituscases, and Plancius’ case, while closely tied to the exile, isnot itself political. The violence cases (as Sestius’ and Milo’s) can onthe other hand be intimately political. Yet this is not a deviation109Donatus igitur est ob eas causas a Cn. Pompeio civitate. Id accusator non negat, sed rep-rehendit, ut in Cornelio causa ipsius probetur, poena quaeratur, in Pompeio causa laedatur, poenasit nulla nisi famae: sic innocentissimi hominis fortunas, praestantissimi imperatoris factum con-demnari volunt.

It is written into the definition of theoffense: violence contra rem publicam.110Such a definition also opensthe door to the defense of Pro Caelio: precisely that the act in ques-tion had no political content.The cases of this period illustrate the complexities of the rela-tionship between politics and the Republican courts. That Romannobles won political prominence by military victories does not implythat the army was merely a ‘political’ institution, i.e. an area forpolitical struggle. So it was with the courts, as well. Nor is there evi-dence that conviction or acquittal was ordinarily a test of politicalstrength, whether factional or political. Roman criminal trials werepolitical not because they were co-opted by the politicians; politicsis in a strong sense at the very heart of the definitions of the offensestried in the iudicia publica. At Rome there are no crimes which werenot political crimes. The courts existed not for the sake of justice inthe abstract (which serves no one in particular), but for the good ofthe Roman people as a whole. The private courts are the courtswhere individuals protect themselves, their property, and their rights.The public courts are those where the community protects itself, itsproperty, and its rights. This idea, if not always in the front of theminds of the jurors, is one they can be led to accept. Hence a higherpolitical good may on occasion be used to preempt the issue of guiltor innocence.111BAlexander, M. Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149 B.C. to 50 B.C.

To maintain social order, elitecitizens must continually fear becoming exposed to public shame:The best citizens are not deterred [from disgraceful behavior] by fearof a punishment that has been sanctioned by laws as much as by thesense of shame that has been instilled by nature as a kind of fear ofjust censure (vituperationis non iniustae). The founder of the state usedpublic opinion to cause this sense of shame to grow and refined itthrough both established customs and training. As a result shame, noless than fear, keeps the citizen from doing wrong.1The ideal state Cicero describes throughout this treatise represents,it is clear, Rome itself.2The passage quoted describes an interme-diate step in the imagined evolution toward Rome’s Republican formof government. The designer of this proto-Republic (ille rector rerumpublicarum), in contrast with his counterpart in Plato’s Republic, wasconceived by his creator as a real model of political behavior.3Duringthe military face-offbetween Julius Caesar and Gnaeus Pompeius in49 B.C.E.,Cicero appeals to this hypothetical founder as the modelfrom which those currently in power have deviated.4In an analo-gous fashion, this founder’s ability to harness the power of words tocurtail disgraceful behavior is informed by the realities of lateMAY_f8_196-217 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 197"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"5J.

The inherited responsibility for maintaining thisdesirable fear of shame falls, I shall argue, to the public speaker, therepresentative of the ‘best citizens.’ Through the extra-legal meansof invective, the public speaker employs language to exclude thepotential lawbreaker from the community of the elite.As a Roman using words to defend a client, attack an enemy, orshape state policy, Cicero is concerned with promoting his own pub-lic persona (ethos), and with identifying that persona with the needsand desires of the community.5It is notable that the orator employshis most angry invective at those key points in his career at whichhe needs to shape new aspects of his public identity: as a righteousyoung prosecutor (Against Verres), as an elected head of state (AgainstCatiline; On the Agrarian Law), as a former exile reestablishing author-ity (Against Vatinius; Against Piso), and as an elder statesman exercis-ing that authority for the last time (Philippics). Although Cicero tendedto act in defense of clients in the majority of his extant speeches,invective nevertheless punctuates his corpus at crucial moments as away of establishing credibility in opposition to his opponents andtheir supporters.In one of the speeches Against Verres, Cicero tells the jury that ‘noone can be a good judge who is not moved by a certain suspicion,’an appeal to his hearers to use analysis of character as a basis forreaching verdicts of guilt or innocence.6As a result of assertions ofthis type, found both in oratory and in the rhetorical handbooks, itis not surprising to hear modern scholars contend that, in persuad-ing an audience through invective, ‘plausibility was...more impor-tant than veracity.’7Yet I am not sure Cicero’s primal founder, withhis confidence in the coercive powers of shame, would have appre-ciated this distinction. Rather, plausibility is what the best citizenwould wish to avoid; it is here where evidence for the justness ofthe censure lies. It is, furthermore, debatable whether the RomanMAY_f8_196-217 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 198"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"jurors would have had the desire to separate the categories of plau-sibility and veracity. A recent study of the concept of crime in thelate Republic concludes that ‘the purpose of the iudicia publica[i.e.,the public criminal courts] was to try persons for harms done to thecommunity as a whole’ and that ‘for Cicero and Quintilian it isacceptable to defend a good man, for he is of value to the societyregardless of his particular guilt.’8Conversely, I shall argue that itis acceptable to condemn a ‘bad’ man by showing his danger tosociety—again, regardless of particular guilt. Invective supplies proof—by identifying a person as unfit for the community the speaker ofnecessity wins over the jury. Invective works as a series of examplesof what a Roman is not. The importance placed on invective allowsthe speaker to include charges that seem to us contrary to the notionof ‘legal’ accusation.Invective takes its function from its goal: if the fear of blame envi-sioned in On the Republicfails to maintain order, the perceived vio-lator becomes exposed to public ridicule and is thereby excludedfrom the community.9In what follows I will 1) outline the recog-nizable categories of invective; 2) survey Cicero’s deployment of thesecategories; 3) discuss how Roman sources identify invective not sim-ply as a literary artifice inherited from an older tradition, but asoperating within the extra-legal framework Cicero posits in On theRepublicas particular to Rome.Areas of InvectiveThe public shaming (translated above as ‘censure’), which Cicero’sScipio wished would inspire fear in every member of the Romanelite, is represented by the Latin word vituperatio—perhaps the near-est equivalent classical Latin has to the English ‘invective.’ In theLatin rhetorical tradition, vituperatio, paired with its antithesis laus(‘praise’), constitutes the principal two topics that make up the causademonstrativa, the epideictic mode of speaking.10The use of the rhetor-8A.

The Roman rhetorical treatises agree withScipio in identifying the purpose of invective as the public shamingof a known individual through the open recounting of faults.11Thenarration of faults, the treatises continue, aims at influencing an audi-ence’s emotions rather than at providing logical proof.12This doesnot mean, however, that invective was thought to rely on falsehood,but that the space for proof of the specific charge at hand lies in aseparate part of the speech, the confirmation and refutation.13When we turn to the specific subjects that rhetorical theory findsappropriate for censure in an opponent, we immediately recognizethe types of accusations encountered in Cicero’s oratorical practice.I quote from Cicero’s Divisions of Oratory a typical example of areasthat offer opportunities for vituperatio:14These are the chief points to be illustrated: how the person has beenborn, brought up, educated, trained, and morally constituted; whetheranything great or unbelievable has occurred (especially of possible divineorigin); furthermore, whatever the person has thought, said, or donewill be fit to the classes of virtues just discussed.15These classes that had just been discussed encompass three areas:properties of the body (corpus), of the mind (animus), and external cir-cumstances such as upbringing and background (externa).16This three-fold description of the types of subjects to be censured in invectivecorresponds well with the categories normally identified as most fre-quently employed in oratorical invective, including that of Cicero.The ten most commonly identified topics of accusation in the Romanthe rhetorical tradition see further J. Martin, Antike Rhetorik: Technik und Methode(München: Beck 1974): 10, Koster (1980): 7–21.11This accords well with the formal definition given by Koster (1980) at the con-clusion of his book-length study (354).12E.g., Cic. Part.71: [finis vituperationis est] turpitudo. conficitur autem genus hoc dictio-nis narrandis exponendisque factis sine ullis argumentationibus, ad animi motus leniter tractandosmagis quam ad fidem faciendam aut confirmandam accommodate.13Cic. Part.33: [confirmatio et refutatio] ad faciendam fidem pertinent.14Koster (1980): 16–21 offers a compendium of these lists from an assortmentof Greek and Latin texts.15Cic. Part.82: haec erunt illustranda maxime, quem ad modum quisque generatus, quemad modum educatus, quem ad modum institutus moratusque fuerit; et si quid cui magnum autincredibile acciderit maximeque si id divinitus accidisse potuerit videri; tum quod quisque senseritdixerit gesserit ad ea, quae proposita sunt, virtutum genera accommodabuntur.16For the history of these categories, H.

Althoughthe list may seem to include any possible type of unfortunate cir-cumstance or improper behavior, there are in fact surprising omis-sions—there is little slander of inappropriate religious behavior, forexample, and mockery of corpulence is rare.18I would like to spendthe remainder of this chapter investigating further the meaningsbehind these accusations: why did the Romans consider certain formsof behavior worthy of public utterance and relevant to legal andpolitical discourse? Identifying how these categories constitute sourcesof shame can facilitate a better understanding of the types of behav-ior public invective was meant to control.Limits of InvectiveRome had a strong tradition of public invective and acerbic humorbefore Cicero first stepped onto the rostra. Horace famously remarkson the ‘Italic vinegar’ that distinguished Roman oratorical practicefrom its Greek predecessors.19Cicero himself, in his speech On Behalfof Plancius, defends the right of a member of the equestrian class torebuke a senator in public, equating the practice with the venera-ble traditions of freedom of speech at Rome (ille mos...illa aequitasiuris...illa antiqua libertas; Planc.33).

He dwells especially on the well-knownauctioneer Quintus Granius, who outspokenly critiqued famous politi-cians without repercussion and became a symbol at Rome for free-dom of political expression. This practice of exposing politicians topossible shame allows Granius to be listed along with Lucilius, LuciusCrassus, and Laelius as a prototype for the Roman man of wit.20Pre-Ciceronian oratory too, despite its fragmentary state, indicatesthat vigorous denunciation constituted an acceptable part of publicspeaking, and Marcus Aurelius can cite the elder Cato’s oratory ofthree centuries earlier as a model of invective practice.21By the first century B.C.E., invective has become such an expectedpractice that Cicero can call personal attacks on a defendant a ‘kindof law of the prosecution’ (lex...quaedam accusatoria; Mur. 11). In hisspeech On Behalf of Fonteius, in fact, he claims that, since the op-posing prosecutors did not attack Fonteius personally in their open-ing speeches, this lack must provide direct indications of his client’sinnocence:Has there ever been a defendant—especially one whose sphere includedseeking public office and holding political and military command—who has been accused in such a way that the prosecutor has chargedhim with no scandal, no crime, no shameful behavior arising fromlust, effrontery, or boldness? If there were not true grounds for suspi-cion, certainly some could have been contrived.22The underlying assumption represents the converse of that commonlystated in the contemporary rhetorical handbooks: that if a man canbe shown guilty of one fault, he can be shown responsible for all.23Therefore, Cicero claims, if Fonteius has been the target of no accu-sations, he must be innocent of the principal charge for which he20Cic.

It is reasonable to interpret rhetorical prescriptionssuch as these, together with their manifestations in practice, as evi-dence for the freedom allowed speakers at Rome to levy irrespon-sible accusations against an opponent. Surely this is one possiblereading of the evidence, but other passages in Cicero indicate thatwe should perhaps treat more seriously this belief that immoralitynecessarily manifests itself in a nexus of immoral acts.It would be instructive in this context to be able to read howCicero directly defended himself from attacks on his character.Doubtless many such attacks existed but, unfortunately, no substan-tial passages in which Cicero’s contemporaries voice their disapprovalhave survived in more than fragments.24There do exist, however,passages in which Cicero wards offpersonal attacks directed towardhis client. His argument in the speech On Behalf of Murenadependsupon the same assumption that underlies the passage of On Behalf ofFonteiusdiscussed above. Part of the prosecutor’s attack on Murenaincluded allegations that he engaged in the un-Roman activity ofdancing.25Cicero responds by asserting that, for the prosecutor tobe correct in this individual claim, Murena must also have engagedin attendant immoral activities associated with the intemperate ban-quet (Mur. 13). Since it is known that Murena does not frequentsuch feasts, then Cicero feels secure that the charge of dancing ceasesto provide a legitimate source of shame. By rebutting a single charge,Cicero can show Murena innocent of all the vices of the banquet.In light of these two passages from Cicero’s defenses of Fonteiusand Murena, it is possible to offer a hypothesis that restores credi-bility to the public use of invective. Most members of the jury lis-tening to these charges, after all, are trained in the same kind ofrhetorical tradition as the speakers to whom they are obliged to lis-ten. Are we to think that they simply allowed impossible charges tobe levied as a means of entertainment, an entertainment, moreover,with critical implications not only for fellow members of the elite24Cic. Att.1.16.9–10 contains the invaluable altercatiowith Clodius, although hereagain Cicero, who is relating the debate to Atticus, emerges superior. See too theinvectives preserved at [Sal.] Cic.and Dio 46.1–28 (with Koster [1980]: 177–189,200–210), which suggest some of the charges to which Cicero would have beenvulnerable.25For dancing as a vice, see A.

Perhaps; surely the history of political trials in thefinal years of the Republic indicates an overly litigious society.Nevertheless, a more satisfactory response is to consider that thebelief that one vice can lead to a criminal life offered a means forthe efficient control of potentially anti-social behavior, behavior thatmight threaten elite structures of rule. It is in this context that theemphasis in the passage just quoted from On Behalf of Fonteiusbecomesespecially interesting: the more important a defendant, as measuredby the amount of political and military power he wields, the moreprobable it is that he will be exposed to public scrutiny of his moral-ity. The more essential is it, then, that he remain free of ‘the fearof just censure.’Invective ChargesIf invective did in fact function to limit improper behavior by theelite, determining the types of charges most commonly advanced willshed light on the kinds of behavior deemed most inimical to themaintenance of political stability. The categories of abuse range frompredictable types of socially deviant behavior to less obviously threat-ening forms of conduct. Among those categories that one wouldexpect to be objectionable is included the charge that an opponenthas engaged in incestuous behavior; the most infamous object ofsuch attacks by Cicero is Clodius, who is accused on many occa-sions of having sexual relations with one or more of his sisters.26Another common motif is to claim that the opponent is a bandit(latro), a charge that implies not simply criminal activity but is alsofigured by Cicero as including behavior that can threaten to over-turn the established political order.27Scholars have recently shownhow less clear charges also depend on exploiting deeper biases inRoman society. The rhetoric against rustic behavior, for example,would normally be difficult to use in a society such as Rome, wherehistorical exempla are continually employed to underscore the value26F. Hickson-Hahn, “What’s so Funny? Laughter and Incest in Invective Humor,”Syllecta Classica 9 (1998), treats Roman invective about incest (19–25 cover Cicero).27T.

Yet when this cat-egory occurs as a topic of invective, it moves from being a simpleattack on a specific occupation, relying instead on the associationsmade between the lack of self-control exhibited by a rural figure andthe types of behavior exposed by complementary categories of invec-tive, such as effeminate mannerisms and excessive theatricality.28Thenotion of a lack of self-control also informs what is the ultimate accu-sation of socially inappropriate behavior: to call an opponent a beast.Even this charge, frequently found in Cicero, has been demonstratedto be more complicated than may first appear, being tied into philo-sophical notions that being human implies responsibilities towardsociety and the state.29To be called a beast is to show that suchresponsibilities have been abandoned.A careful examination of less clearly objectionable subjects of invec-tive shows that they too rely on exposing an opponent as funda-mentally opposed to the inherent well-being of the Roman community.Three of the commonest topics include mocking the opponent’s eth-nicity, name, and physical appearance. Each of these personal fea-tures is predicated on definitions of the natural, especially on theways in which the transgression of allegedly natural behavior becomesvisibly manifest in the opponent’s external appearance. If the oratorcan succeed in identifying his opponent with such behavior, then theopponent does not belong in the community.A non-Roman background provided easy material for public invec-tive. Yet Cicero’s objections to foreign influence in the courts nor-mally relies not on exploiting simple xenophobia, but on demonstratingthat foreign testimony, by its very nature, is of suspect value in aRoman forum. In rejecting the testimony of the Gauls against hisclient Fonteius, Cicero appeals to the sanctity of the oath and fearof the gods, and figures these religious scruples as essential for theadministration of Roman justice. Since the Gauls do not share thesame religious reverence, it is impossible to trust them on oath.3028C. Connors, “Field and Forum: Culture and Agriculture in Roman Rhetoric,”in W.

In the speeches against Verres,for example, it is made abundantly clear through that governor’sdress, effeminate behavior, convivial excess, and impiety toward thegods that it is he who is the real ‘Greek;’ the Sicilians who havebrought him to trial, on the contrary, have ‘no similarities with therest of the Greeks.’33In a similar vein, Cicero’s plea to give Romancitizenship to the Greek poet Archias involves not so much a defenseof Greek culture as a naturalization of Archias and his trade as tra-ditionally Roman: repeatedly referred to by his Latin name, AulusLicinius, Archias is represented as carrying on an established andhonored Roman tradition of extending Greek arts throughout Italy.34Ethnic hostilities could also include those who live on the Italianpeninsula itself, but outside the capital city. Prejudice for the city ofRome, a prejudice reinforced by so many other aspects of Republicansociety, provided a means for the urban elite to maintain ascendancyin the face of rising provincial families.35Cicero himself was born amere seventy miles from Rome in a municipality that had enjoyedfull citizen rights since 188 B.C.E. Nevertheless, as the first of hisfamily to attain the consulship, he had on several occasions to endurecharges of being an ‘immigrant citizen at Rome’ or ‘Rome’s thirdforeign king.’36Cicero found a ready defense from these charges in31For a full discussion of this form of ethnic stereotyping in Cicero, see Vasaly(1993): 191–243.32Riggsby (1999): 129–136.33Ver.2.2.7: nihil ceterorum simile Graecorum; on Verres, see Vasaly (1993): 212–217,J.

When, therefore, he used the same typeof charges in his own invective against Lucius Piso, Cicero took careto question Piso’s Romanitasfrom more than one angle: his scornfulreference to Piso as the ‘Campanian consul’ refers to the residentsof Campania who, by revolting from Rome during the war againstHannibal, exposed themselves to the potential for public disdain forcenturies afterward.37The ridicule afforded by this connection withsouthern Italy is further reinforced by Cicero ascribing to Piso thenames and epithets Caesoninus Semiplacentius Calventius, indicating thathis mother’s family originated from the Gallic provinces to the north.38The peculiarities of the Roman naming system allowed Cicero fre-quent opportunities to mock an opponent’s heritage on other occa-sions—the manner in which the orator merely mentions names suchas Fidiculanius Falcula (Caec.28), Ligus (Har. 5), and Cimber (Phil.11.14) could stir up in the Roman mind deep cultural prejudice.39The mockery of names suggests another large category of invec-tive, the mockery of physical peculiarities. It is an oddity of Romanonomastics that the third name, or cognomen, traditionally the provinceof the elite in the Republican era, denotes in nearly half the recordedinstances a peculiarity of the body, mind, or both.40In Cicero’sworks, to cite a few examples, Romans name the following oppo-nents in order to mark them as objects of derision: Bambalio (‘stut-terer;’ Phil.3.16), Brutus (‘stupid,’ Att.6.1.25 [SB 115]), Verres(‘uncastrated boar,’ e.g. Ver.2.1.121, 2.4.56). The reason for thedevelopment of the onomastic phenomenon of the pejorative nameremains unclear, but it is indisputable that the attendant circum-stance of mocking physical deformities dominates invective. Just asmarking an opponent’s ethnic traits excluded him from the Romancommunity, so too did the highlighting of physical peculiarities implysocial deviance. The underlying premise would appear to be thenotion common in antiquity that physical exterior mirrors moral inte-rior. This notion is clearly reflected in a notable passage from Cicero’s37Pis.24; see too Dom.60 and Vasaly (1993): 217–243 (on Agr.2). The preciseconnections this Piso had with Campania remain uncertain (Nisbet [1961]: 186–188).38Pis.14; see further, Corbeill (1996): 170–171.39For these names and on names in Roman invective generally, see Corbeill(1996): 57–98.40I.

After detailing the physical odd-ities marking Roscius’s accuser Gaius Fannius (he has unusually shorthead and facial hair), the orator reveals to his audience that Fannius’sappearance foretold his deceitful nature:For those of you who do not know him, consider his face. SurelyFannius’s very head and eyebrows, so closely shaven, seem to stink ofevil and proclaim his shrewd nature. Surely (if physical appearancedoes in fact allow one to make inferences even though it cannot speak)from the tips of his toenails to the very top of his head, this man isentirely made up of fraud, deceit, and lies.41Cicero deliberately inserts into his invective the proviso ‘if physicalappearance does in fact allow one to make inferences even thoughit cannot speak.’ The purpose of this parenthetical aside causes amodern reader to pause. It certainly cannot be intended to encour-age his audience to make allowances for Fannius’s appearance; Cicerois not one to arouse sympathy for an opponent. Rather, the asser-tion draws to the attention of his audience that they should in factallow physical peculiarities to guide them in making judgments aboutguilt. The orator reaffirms a bias by offering in a public context aseemingly indisputable example of its validity.Cicero seems to have willingly mocked an unusual physique asdeviant whenever the opportunity presented itself.42He especiallyexploits this opportunity in his invective Against Vatinius, where thetheme becomes a recurrent motif of the speech.Publius Vatiniussuffered throughout his life from swellings on the face and neck, andspent his lifetime enduring abuse for these deformities. These tumorsafford Cicero the opportunity for a series of attacks: Vatinius threat-ens Cicero ‘like a serpent emerging from its lair—eyes jutting out,throat swollen, neck bulging’ (Vat.4); his pouting threatens to cause‘his swellings to burst’ (Vat. 10). Eventually, the speech climaxes withVatinius’s growths becoming so sickened by Vatinius’s behavior thatthey ‘move away from the wicked area around his mouth and locatethemselves in other areas’ (Vat.39). Identifying publicly an oppo-nent’s physical deficiencies provided a powerful rhetorical means forexcluding that opponent from society.41Q.

In oratory, this was done bypointing to outward signs by which effeminate behavior is mademanifest to the viewer; clothing, hairstyle, perfume, gesture, voice,and walk were all exploited by an opposing orator as visual cuesthat the opponent has lapsed from the appropriate, socially acceptablestyle of dress and deportment.43The bias has a long and full tradi-tion; an early example from 142 B.C.E. includes most of the featuresthat Cicero comes to use against his own opponents in the followingcentury. Scipio Aemilianus inveighs against Publius Sulpicius Galus:If someone, drenched daily in perfumes, adorns himself before a mir-ror, shaves his eyebrows, walks about with his beard plucked and thighhairs pulled out; who, as a young boy with his lover, wearing a long-sleeved tunic, was accustomed to lie in the low spot at banquets, whois not only fond of wine, but fond of men also, then would anyonedoubt that he has done the same thing that pathics usually do?44Numerous passages from Cicero’s invective indicate that the expectedanswer to this truly rhetorical question is an emphatic ‘No.’ As inthe mockery of ethnicity, names, and physical peculiarities, exclusionof the sexual deviant depends upon the existence of visible evidence.Effeminacy in a male was perceived as an aberration of whatRoman society deemed as natural behavior. Reversal of expectednatural roles could become suspect in other areas as well. In hisspeech On Behalf of Cluentius, a mother is chastised for discardingwhat is expected of a maternal role (Clu.193). Further examplesinclude the mockery of an opponent’s trade if it is deemed inap-propriate for a member of the elite; conversely, if one’s family is ofindisputably high standing, it is acceptable to take an opponent totask for not living up to the expectations of ancestors.45The latteris an especially effective tool against Publius Clodius and his sisterClodia, both of whom Cicero figures as a disgrace to the great tra-dition of the Claudian family.46Finally, Cicero on several occasionsimpugns the honesty of those who label themselves as ‘popular’ politi-cians (populares) by pointing out that their behavior is far from beloved43Richlin (1992): 97–98; Corbeill (1996): 128–169.

Consequently, for a community thatrelies on reading appearances to understand morality, hypocrisy—both verbal and visual—is especially problematic. The theme of thesubversive dangers of hypocrisy plays a particularly prominent rolein Cicero’s invective speech Against Piso, as well as on other occa-sions when Cicero mentions Piso. Lucius Calpurnius Piso proved tobe a particularly intractable subject for abuse since his family back-ground and demeanor would seem to indicate the ideal Roman. Ihave already mentioned how Cicero manipulates Piso’s name to castdoubts upon his heritage, but what could an orator do with his sternappearance? It is a dissemblance, Cicero claims, one specificallydesigned to deceive the viewer.48What enabled Piso to succeed asa politician was not any personal merit, but his ability to hide behindhis family name.49To reveal the extent of this hypocrisy, of the ‘evilwrapped up in the layers of his brow’ (Pis.12), requires informationindependent of appearance. Fortunately, Cicero has learned fromother members of the Piso clan (although only by chance) that thisLucius is an intruder into the family (Red. Sen.15). Piso, it seems,has learned the proper categories he should inhabit to present a justand upright persona to the people. The abuse of this knowledgethreatens the mechanics of just censure that have been designed toensure continuity within the Roman community.The most damning invective in the Ciceronian corpus, such asthat against Piso and Vatinius, occurs not in speeches held beforethe people but in those intended to be delivered before a group ofsenatorial peers. This interesting and perhaps surprising fact war-rants some explanation. A telling example of the importance of venueis provided by the figures of Piso and Gabinius: the objects of viciousinvective in Cicero’s speeches before members of the elite (e.g., Red.Sen.10–18, Sest.17–24), their actions in opposing his recall fromexile are spoken of with an almost benign understanding in a con-temporary speech before the people (Red.

Rather, as isimplied in the passage quoted from On the Republicat the beginningof this chapter, the mechanisms for shame operate differently in theclosed oligarchy of the elite and before the people amassed as abody. Indeed, it is virtually certain that these apparent inconsisten-cies in the portrayal of Piso and Gabinius must have been intendedby Cicero—he could have edited any embarrassing inconsistenciesbefore publication—and they have been plausibly explained as serv-ing a didactic function. Cicero teaches his readers how venue deter-mines treatment.50Rather than reflecting a lack of relation to reality,the inconsistencies demonstrate in fact a close awareness of the val-ues and workings of the Roman political process.Invective as Moral TeachingThe suggestion that oratory can serve a didactic purpose leads toCicero’s own expressed views of the educational function served byhis words of reproach. Cicero’s greatest works of invective—thespeeches Against Verresand Against Piso, the Second PhilippicagainstMarcus Antonius—were to survive well beyond their original his-torical purpose as examples for study and emulation. In addition toserving a specific function at the time of delivery, Cicero foresawthe value that these types of composition possessed as moral lessonsfor posterity.As early as 60 B.C.E. Cicero described his consular orations of 63as offering a model for the study of contemporary youths; this setof works includes the invective offered in the speeches On the AgrarianLawandAgainst Catiline.51In 57 B.C.E. he delivered the oration Onhis House, a work filled with harsh denunciation of Clodius and char-acterized by Cicero in his correspondence as inspired in part by hispersonal indignation (dolor); this speech too, he tells Atticus, must beimmediately published so as not to deprive the youth of his day.5250W.

Theexchange clearly underscores Cicero’s perception of the usefulnessinvective has for a properly functioning free society. In July of 43,Brutus had written Cicero a letter criticizing the elder statesman forbeing too generous in dispensing honors to the young Octavian.53In his reply, Cicero refers to Brutus’s explicit criticism, while remarkingfurther that ‘perhaps someone else (maybe even you) would add thatI am rather harsh in my use of censure and punishment.’54He thenproceeds to justify both alleged deficiencies of character by quotingan unknown text of Solon. The formulation recalls the function ofpraise and blame outlined by Aemilianus’s ruler in On the Republic:‘a state is held together by two things, reward and punishment.’55In the remainder of the letter, Cicero appraises his role in dis-tributing ‘reward and punishment’ during the period following theassassination of Julius Caesar. Under the category of punishment isincluded the public verbal censure of inappropriate behavior; exam-ples of invective will act as ‘eternal reminders of the public hatredtoward the most cruel enemies’ (23.9: in crudelissimos hostes monumentaodii publici sempiterna). It is within this context that he places the final,and in many ways most harsh, example of oratorical invective of hiscareer, the Philippicsagainst Marcus Antonius and his allies. Cicero’sevaluation of these speeches provides for Brutus—and us—his mostdirect explanation of the importance of invective:I delivered these opinions...not so much for the sake of vengeance.Rather, I intended to use fear for the present situationto deter wickedcitizens from attacking the state, while I intended to leave behind forposteritya lesson so that no one might wish to imitate their style ofmadness.5653Brut. ad Brut.12.4 (1.4a.4): prudentia...nulla abs te desideratur nisi modus in tribuendishonoribus.54Cic. ad Brut.23.3 (1.15.3): alius fortasse, quod in animadversione poenaque durior, nisiforte utrumque tu.55Cic. ad Brut.23.3 (1.15.3): [Solon] rem publicam contineri duabus rebus dixit, praemioet poena.56Cic. ad Brut.23.10 (1.15.10): dixi igitur sententias...neque tam ulciscendi causa quam212 MAY_f8_196-217 7/11/02 8:50 PM Page 212"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The dichotomy by which verbal criticism acts simultaneously as aweapon for the present and an example for the future provides aconvenient framework within which to close this discussion.One of Cicero’s other correspondents, Gaius Trebonius, echoesthe orator’s assertion that political circumstances permit the justexpression of anger against prominent contemporaries. In settingsome of Cicero’s invective to verse, Trebonius justifies his own plain-spokenness by citing the baseness (turpitudo) of his target (apparentlyMarcus Antonius).57Turpitudois what Ciceronian rhetorical treatisesof the same period advise the orator to uncover with his invective.58I have already reviewed the various topics that allowed the oratormost readily to reveal to his hearers the baseness of an opponent:ethnic origin, social class, physical appearance. In addition to thesetopoi, the invective speeches are also linked in the ways in whichtheir arguments develop. In most speeches, the speaker’s opponentis initially depicted simply as a violator of social expectations. Thedepiction then grows increasingly hostile until, ultimately, it climaxeswith the revelation that the opponent can no longer be tolerated notonly by society but by himself. This is the preeminent claim thatCicero’s rhetoric can make; that he has convinced allhis hearers ofhis opponent’s impropriety, including the opponent. To take thefamiliar example of his First Speech against Catiline: after setting out tothe Senate the indications of Catiline’s danger, Cicero spends thebulk of the speech addressing Catiline, showing that the abandon-ment of Rome is in his best interest as well and that he himself, asconsul, refuses to take direct responsibility for Catiline’s punishment(Catil. 1.10–27). The social outcast is represented as realizing his ownlack of worth. The orator has not only taught a lesson to his peers,but to the very enemy he wishes to overthrow.The speech Against Piso provides a more conspicuous example ofhow the opponent develops from being a danger to the state tobecoming a complete outcast who should recognize his own insig-nificance. As already mentioned, the extant opening of Against Pisocontains familiar rhetorical topoi of invective: Piso is non-Roman inut et in praesenssceleratos civis timore ab impugnanda patria deterrerem et in posterumdocu-mentum statuerem ne quis talem amentiam vellet imitari.57Treb.

Then, as he had in the First Speech against Catiline, Ciceropasses over the possibility of inflicting physical punishment upon hisopponent (who is here paired with his consular colleague Gabinius):‘if I were to see you and Gabinius attached to a cross, would I feelgreater joy at the mutilation of your bodies than I now feel at themutilation of your reputations?’60True punishment, he continues,derives from the criminal being overcome with guilt, so that hebecomes the object of hatred by good citizens, thereby losing anysense of dignity (Pis.43). One may compare the close of the speechAgainst Vatinius, where social death leaves the criminal no option butphysical death. Cicero closes Against Pisowith strong language describ-ing the hatred of Piso at every level of Roman society, the best pun-ishment an orator could desire (45–46). The orator acts as teacheronce more, teaching his hearers how they should read (and haveread) deviance while teaching his opponent what the inevitable out-come of his actions should be. And yet the speech is only half over,since Piso has not yet himself come to learn that his universal hatredis deserved. This final realization is saved for the speech’s climax,where Cicero adds one important element to the attack already deliv-ered at sections 41–46. Cicero repeats that he wished not to makePiso physically suffer, but to become the object of scorn before theentire community of Rome and Italy. Cicero then concludes thatPiso’s guilt is confirmed by his opponent’s realization that ‘he hateshimself, fears everyone, . . . and considers himself guilty’ (98). Theevidence provided by invective has succeeded in persuading Piso ofhis own unfitness for Roman society.These examples make clear how Cicero could claim to Brutus thathis invective employed fear to deter acts of wickedness for the pre-sent. He envisioned his future legacy, by contrast, as providing mod-els by which future orators could also perceive immorality and therebyexpose criminality. Soon after the appearance of his attack on Piso,he boasts in a letter to his brother Quintus that all the Roman boys59More details in Nisbet (1961): 192–197.60Cic.

As a public speaker, Cicero impresses readers mostwith his invective, an impression seemingly shared by the orator him-self if we consider the way violent accusations punctuate his politi-cal life. The resultant picture is of a man boldly defending with hislanguage a vision of Rome, who not only asserts freedom of speechas the appropriate answer to the madness of injustice but who expectseveryone to agree with that assertion.64In making this effort toredeem Cicero’s vehemence and to locate invective at the service ofstability, I acknowledge the possibility that Cicero has succeeded indeluding me through his rhetoric as well, two thousand years afterhis death. In the final sentence of a book of more than 600 pages,a book devoted to forensic activity during the time of Cicero, onescholar has remarked: ‘Cicero has not ceased providing for the schol-ars of every age—orators, clergy, and then professors—the comfort-ing illusion that they could have been the leaders in their community,61Cic.

They pit Rome’s greatest ora-tor—every act of verbal persuasion being in part an agon—againsthis most sophisticated audience, C. Julius Caesar, imperatorand dic-tator, a scholar, author, and orator of the highest distinction. Althoughgrouped by chronology and addressee, in other ways they are quitedisparate. The first, Pro M. Marcello, is not a judicial speech, but wasdelivered in the Senate to thank Caesar for his pardon of M. ClaudiusMarcellus. The Pro Ligarioand Pro Rege Deiotaroboth take the formof judicial speeches, and, under the exceptional powers of Caesar’soffice, were delivered before the dictator acting as single judge,3buttheir venues and their aims were very different. The Lig., given inthe Forum in the presence of a coronais the defense of a formerPompeian, charged apparently with some form of lèse majesté. TheDeiot., the defense of a Galatian tetrarch against the charge of attempt-ing to murder Caesar, was heard in the home of Caesar, in thepresence perhaps of his concilium.Beyond responding to its situation, each speech has further aims:the Marc. to put Marcellus’ pardon in a broader political context,the Lig. to urge perseverance in the policy of clementia, the Deiot. toassure Caesar of the king’s loyalty.

The orator cedes the parity of Caesaras a man of letters4and master of the art of oratory, inviting himto observe his choice of tactics and strategies, to smile at forms ofdeception, to appreciate all aspects of his ingenuity and art. In return,he assumes the respect of the most powerful man in the world andleave to speak frankly and familiarly on matters of state. How Cicerostrives to achieve such a rapport is the subject of this paper.It was tempting to go beyond this goal and extrapolate somethingmore personal and psychological about the relationship between thesetwo historical giants. However, a Ciceronian speech can only inci-dentally mirror his true feelings, and even then identification of the‘real’ Cicero amidst the many voices he creates would be an entirelysubjective process. If the true Cicero cannot be extrapolated, it isequally unsound to import him from other evidence or the commu-nis opinio. To do so is an exercise in petitio principi. Some aspects ofthe communis opinioare palpably contestable and should be questionedby any student of these speeches or their author.Cicero returned to Rome with a pardon in late 47 to find gov-ernment at a standstill. Caesar dominated both by military victoriesand his position as dictator, but had spent little time in Italy sincecrossing the Rubicon. He had control of the Senate, but resistancecontinued in Africa and Spain, threatening to destabilize his power.Some of his surviving opponents had accepted his clementia, otherswere awaiting pardon, and a few dramatically had spurned it. Cicerofound little public business being conducted in Rome. He later avowed(Fam. 4.4.4) that he had resolved to attend the Senate, but, in protestagainst Caesar’s usurpation, not to speak out—a choice renderedeasier by Caesar’s absences, by the Senate’s impotence,5and by hisown limited popularity with its members on both sides; letters revealMAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 220"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"his lack of popularity with ex-Pompeians (seeFam.7.3.2–3; 9.5). Buthe had not entirely retired from politics; he was working with suc-cess to gain pardon for ex-Pompeians like Caecina and Paetus. Hirtiusand Balbus, Caesarians both, were becoming intimates, and he hadmade his peace with Cassius Longinus, Junius Brutus, and CorneliusDolabella. He was no more inactive than other Roman politicians.As to Cicero’s despair at the prospect of a fatally wounded Republic,to what point in the political system in which he had lived andworked from Sulla to Clodius would Cicero have liked to return?The power struggles from, say, 75 to 65 which took him to the pin-nacle of public life also created the dynasts. 63 was good year forCicero in spite of an attempted coup d’état, but one in which hewas kept by a Tribune from giving a valedictory on leaving office.59 saw him in restless retirement,6followed by a degrading retreatcaused by Clodius, from which he only extricated himself by toad-ying to the Triumvirs. By the end of the decade could not easilyhave recalled a promising moment for the Republic.Yet, and this is important if the past is any guide to the future,to the option of retirement he had always been unsuited. He hadrecognized that his best hope for political influence after office wasto attach himself to a more powerful Roman as an advisor, playingLaelius Sapiens to a modern Scipio Africanus. He reached out invain to Pompey, rejecting the more appreciative Caesar. Yet, he kepton trying. Even after the debacle of his defense of Milo, Ciceroseems no more eager to leave Rome in 51 for foreign service thanhe had been in 62.Students of Roman history take a highly dramatized view of thisperiod of Cicero’s life, highlighting his despondency over his posi-tion, his bitterness at the loss of the Republic, his heroic attemptsto intervene in its behalf in its death throes, the suicidal final surgeof energy with which he opposed Antony. It is important to dispelsuch notions. Dire though things may have seemed to him, he couldnot have known that in the near future the Philippicsreally wouldmark his last struggle for the Republic. Excerpts from the Letters6His decision in 59 to withdraw from politics and devote himself to literary pur-suits did not sustain him. His proposed Geographybored him (Att. 2.6.1) and whenout of Rome he was passionate for news and rumors. See E.

Their evidence is ephemeral, influenced bythe purpose and recipient of each document. Style may also enterinto it. By training and disposition he could express himself in thefull panoply of distinctive voices, from dispassionate to fervent. AtFam. 4.13.1, written in mid-46, he complains that he is limited byevents to the epistolary mode—not of course to the light and wittykind, but the ‘sad and wretched which still should offer some promiseand consolation for your pain; but I had nothing to promise.’ Yet,by section 5 he has cheered himself up and affects to see light atthe end of the political tunnel.7The period of the Caesarianaealsosaw Cicero in the midst of great domestic sadness. What with estrange-ment from his brother, the loss of his daughter, and the bitter divorcefrom his wife, his personal life was at a low ebb and some of thosefeelings may have fueled a temporary depression.In life as in letters, he was capable of being idealistic and cyni-cal almost simultaneously, but almost always in political situations,he was realistic. Certainly, he had never had or needed an idealstate in which to function. As a politician Cicero was practical,trained and disposed to deal with political realities; and he had doneso all his life. It has pleased posterity to judge his fight with Antonyas quixotic; history shows that it was futile. What was in Cicero’smind was to play Octavian against Antony and have the Senate,under his leadership, emerge victorious. The strategy failed; it wascertainly not suicidal.8Similarly, although Cicero probably could never have enjoyed anintimate friendship with Caesar, hostility was not total. Both he andhis brother had benefited from Caesar’s good will. When Caesar waskilled Cicero could rejoice. But this does not mean that he nevercould or did work with him.9He had won pardon for himself andfor others. He could value Caesar’s toleration of his parrhesiaand hischarm as his dinner guest. He admired Caesar’s restrained, literaryresponse to his own praise of Cato, in life and death Caesar’s invet-erate enemy (Att. 13.51).

Master as he was of the Roman qualities of compromiseand pragmatism, he could control both his despair at the politicalsituation and any lingering antipathy to Caesar.

Factors such as these shouldargue against bringing to the Caesarianaea priori notions of Cicero’sdisposition.A curious example of just this mistake is adduced and summarilydismissed by an ancient scholiast.11It relates particularly to the Marc:‘Many think that this speech (Marc. ) is “figured” and assume it con-tains more invective than praise,’ treating it as a work so totallyfigurative as to leave, like allegory, no surface indication of its lit-eral meaning. The ‘many’ must base their reading on their beliefthat Cicero would not sincerely praise Caesar. ‘But this suits neitherreality nor Caesar; for in reality Caesar was being moved to clemencyby true praise, and Caesar was an orator who could not be deceived.’Evidence for the interpretation, by the definition of the strategy,ought not be detectable in the text.12It stretches credulity to believethat a hostile Cicero would openly threaten Caesar, attack himcovertly, or talk over his head to a hostile audience of disaffectedRepublicans.To avoid the biographical fallacy, I put in quotation marks theuse of his name as speaker; e.g. ‘it reflects well on the independence10The praise, though in some ways qualified, is genuine; see H.

Orators must always assess audiences to determine how bestto approach and appeal to them. The question of how the speakerengages his audience is a valid one for the student of rhetoric andoratory. Here, in the circumstances of each oration it may be legit-imate to surmise, at least tentatively, from the personality Cicerocreates for his speaker how he thought his audience might be bestwon over.Pro M. MarcelloAt a meeting of the Senate in the Fall of 46, described soon afterthe event in dramatic detail in Fam. 4. 4, something happened thatgave Cicero hope for public visibility and political viability. CalpurniusPiso, Caesar’s father-in-law, brought up the name of M. Marcellus,anti-Caesarian consul of 51, now living in exile. His cousin, C. Mar-cellus, suddenly threw himself at Caesar’s feet and pleaded for a par-don. At once the entire Senate rose in support. In a conspicuouslyresentful response, Caesar complained of the virulence of the man’sopposition. Then suddenly and unexpectedly he announced that hewould nonetheless accede to the wishes of the Senate and pardonhis enemy.It is difficult to credit the alleged circumstances that led to sucha scene. The Senate, now largely filled with Caesar’s partisans andex-Pompeians indebted to him, is said by Cicero to have sponta-neously and virtually unanimously urged the restoration of Marcellus.13Some attribute importance to Caesar’s decision by assuming Marcellus13It is prudent to be suspicious of spontaneous, unanimous displays of enthusi-asm before absolute leaders. Former Pompeians, beneficiaries of Caesar’s clemency,would have scant cause to embarrass him. Caesarians would have no more incli-nation to adulate Marcellus.224 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 224"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"was the titular leader of the remaining Pompeians. But, though hehad vehemently opposed Caesar,14in the debates of 51–50 he hadargued more as an optimate than a Pompeian. He joined Pompeyat Epirus; but after his leader’s death, like Cicero, he left the cause.In the Brutus(250–51) he is described at Mytilene, not as the polit-ical successor of Cato, but as a Stoic sage on the verge of attainingétaraj¤a. He seems an unlikely focus of Senatorial aspirations, suchas they were, for the restoration of the Republic, having constantlyrejected the wishes of his family and Cicero to ask Caesar forclemency.The view that the event and its outcome were orchestrated byCaesar flows from the premise that as dictator he had the power toset in motion or suppress public events. But if the petition andCaesar’s reaction were pre-arranged, Cicero’s performance cannotbe assumed to have been entirely unexpected. His description of hisresponse (Fam. 4.4.3) sounds sincere and unrehearsed;15but so itmight, even if he had been participating in a political fiction. Caesarwas certainly dramatizing his disposition to defer to the auctoritasofthe Senate. It should be stressed that, whatever views Cicero expressesin the Letterson the loss of the Republic, Caesar gave little evidenceof plans to dismantle Republican institutions.16In an unusual and perhaps equally artificial move, Caesar nextcalled for a voice vote of the Senate in support of his decision.17Itwas under those conditions that Cicero delivered the Marc. In theanalyses that follow I plan to concentrate on passages that establisheither the character of the speaker vis-à-vis his audience or the aimsof the author’s rhetorical strategies (of which the creation of thespeaker is one).14C. disapproved of his scourging a man elevated by Caesar, a senator fromComum (Att. 5.11.2).15Yet he admits (33) that the Senate singled him out to respond. Pluribus verbisis a self-deprecating description of his rhetorical enthusiasm rather than an admis-sion of premature hopes (E. Castorina, L’ultima oratoria di Cicerone [Catania: Giannotta1975]: 113). Given the tone of Fam. 4.4, it cannot reflect later disillusionment.16See R. Syme, The Roman Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1939): 51–4 and53, n. 3 for his alleged cynical comment on Sulla’s willing retirement.17See D. R. Shackleton Bailey, ed., Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares (Cambridge:Cambridge University Press 1977) on Fam. 4.4 (his 203).’  225MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 225"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"M. Tulli Ciceronis Pro M. Marcello oratioEarly critics of the speech read it as a gratulatio, gradually focusingon what they took to be Cicero’s servile adulation of Caesar. Noname looms larger among critics of Cicero than that of F. A. Wolf,18whose judgment that the shameless flattery of the Marc. militatesagainst its genuineness is best contested by reference to the sub-stantial number of places where the speaker presents himself as quitedifferent: critical, impatient, demanding, superior, even threatening.About half a century ago, scholars began to focus on the speaker asa political advisor.19Some more recent scholars assume that the ora-tor used the occasion to fight a covert action against the dictator.20The aspect of the speech assuasoria still dominates, but questionsarise about the character of the advisor,21what he tried to effect,why, and how. ‘Cicero’ advises Caesar to persevere in his policy ofoffering clementiato his defeated enemies. But he also insists that itbe offered consistently, not arbitrarily, as policy, and with an accep-tance that the policy is one of necessity, not indulgence. The readermay suspect a further purpose: that in what he says and how hesays it, the speaker is presenting to the leader he addresses the modelof an advisor, perhaps for the leader’s approval.‘Cicero’ begins, as he frequently does in his speeches, by reflectingon the significance of the occasion and its circumstances and ontheir relation to himself. The function of the Roman patronusis tolend his auctoritasto his client; but in this case, he treats the restora-tion of Marcellus’ status as a condition of his own. It was notinevitable that the speaker should measure the value of Caesar’s deci-sion by its effect on his own standing or the strength of the stateby his own. But that is what, with no apology, he does.Although his presumed purpose (33) is to approve of Caesar’s deci-sion and thank him for having rendered it, ‘Cicero’ first addresses18The ensuing controversy never really challenged the authenticity of the speech.Quintilian never cites it, but later antiquity studied it as exemplary of courtly ora-tory.

In this way, hemay deflect the criticism, never voiced in the Caesarianae,but hereinferred (see Dyer, [1990]: 23–26), that clementia,as an arbitrary actof condescension, has no place in a Republic.Next ‘Cicero’ mentions and praises Marcellus, insisting that thesilence he has kept until now was occasioned by the exile of hisfriend. Strictly speaking, Caesar cannot be blamed for Marcellus’ sit-uation, for his exile, however prolonged, was voluntary. Yet, untilCaesar unilaterally restored the voice and auctoritasof Marcellus, thestate and the Senate were denied the voice and auctoritasof Cicero.Caesar might have found it hard to accept the assumption thathis expansive gesture had committed him to a libera res publicawitha major rôle in it for Cicero,—if Caesar really were expected to bepersuaded by these clever, but hardly subtle rhetorical tactics. ‘Cicero’is not abject or even effusively grateful; nor does he thank Caesarformally until the peroration (33–4). He praises Caesar warmly, butnot indiscriminately. And only when he has established his own cen-trality to the event celebrated by his speech and committed Caesarto his interpretation of that event does ‘Cicero’ utter the name ofC. Caesar.Shifting the point of address to Caesar (3), the speaker repeats hisinterpretation of the event: by yielding23to the Senate, Caesar rec-ognized its fully restored auctoritas and the legitimacy of the Republic.More striking, he insists that the Senate’s wish and Caesar’s pardonvalidate the eminence of Marcellus’ public career. Its corollary, thatthe pardon, in turn, redounds to the glory of the man who offeredit, even reverses the emphasis: it is the excellence of Marcellus thatlends respectability to Caesar’s act.24Such an ungrateful argument,22He uses the vocative three times in 1–2, only once later, in 13.23In spite of offensionibus, still undefined at 21–2.

Gelzer, Caesar: Politician and Statesman (Cambridge, MA: HarvardUniversity Press 1968): 282, saw a reference to the plot of which C. accuses Antony(Phil. 2.74).24With similar circularity the speaker reasons that others pardoned by Caesarcannot have been criminals, because (13): ‘Caesar would not bring a state enemyinto the Curia.’ The generosity of Caesar’s act is in this way qualified. So, Lig.19,with reference to himself.’  227MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 227"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"insistent in its demand that Caesar acknowledge the legitimacy andvirtues of his bitter opponent, is not an obvious one for Caesar tohave wished Cicero to make. Still, it portrays the speaker as inde-pendent, with enough integrity to eschew abject flattery. Quintilian(IO9.2.27–8) points out that the affectation of parrhesiais itself aform of flattery. The exordiumends with Caesar hearing an exuber-ant encomium to Marcellus.Having proceeded by a bold, but logical sequence to a laus Marcelli,Cicero shifts without transition to a grand laudatioof Caesar’s mili-tary attainments: ‘No man’s flow of genius, no man’s power of speak-ing or writing, no man’s abundance of material is enough to listyour exploits, Caesar, much less adorn them.’ The superlative open-ing assertion is abruptly diminished by a qualification: ‘Nonetheless,I assert, with all due respect to you, that the glory they convey isno grander that what you have gained today.’ Any objection onCaesar’s part is preemptorily dismissed with et hoc pace dicam tua,though he might not balk too strenuously at being elevated to states-man. The military genius that won for Caesar a quadruple triumphis subordinated to the glory his present action will assure him in areasoned thesisin expository style.25‘Cicero’ again stresses the sin-gularity of the glory Caesar gained by pardoning Marcellus by insist-ing that only it belongs to Caesar alone: ‘But in the glory, C. Caesar,which you have just won, you have no partner: whatever it is—andit is great—it is all, all I say, yours.’ The point, though fulsomelyexpressed, is critical: sapientiaand consiliumare beyond fortune, com-pletely in a man’s power. All credit belongs to the man who exhibitsthem. The style is didactic; the voice that expresses this observationin a balanced antithetical coda (7 fin.) is that of a teacher or advisor.The advice behind this thesis is practical and political and it is notover. To bring wisdom to fruition a further virtue is necessary: self-control, which ‘Cicero’ deems the ultimate virtue of a man: (8) ‘Toovercome emotion, restrain anger, be temperate in victory, not justlift up a prostrate foe, but enhance his former dignitas—the man whohas done this I do not compare with the greatest men, but I judgemost like god.’ The attribution of (near) divinity to a man so endowedis barely remarkable in the full flight of rhetorical exuberance.

The distinction is deliberateand important. Any well wisher might on this occasion praise Caesarand thank him for his restraint. ‘Cicero’ defines a goal and in asense challenges Caesar to meet it. But the glory that it brings is inthe future (10):...‘with what benevolence shall we embrace it!’ Fornow, Caesar must accept the fact that his prospects for glory dependin part on restoring the auctoritasof his enemy at the behest of theRoman Senate.The sapientiaof which ‘Cicero’ speaks is not academic philosophy,Stoic or otherwise; indeed, he debunks such abstract speculation insection 25: ‘And so I was unhappy to hear that oh! so famous andphilosophical discourse of yours’; ‘. . . do not be philosophical to ourdetriment...’ and section 27...‘[That glory] for which you won’tdeny you are most avid, however philosophical you are.’ It is prac-tical Roman wisdom which, combined with self-control, can realizethe victory of intellect over passion that is fundamental to reconcil-iation. Political and social peace are requisite to the return of repub-licanism. ‘Cicero’s’ disquisition is practical and political and underliesa coherent and consistent policy.‘Cicero’ characterizes clementianot as a generous and kindly act,but as part of a sensible, well thought-out program of post-war recon-ciliation. Hence his insistence on sapientia26as the force motivatingthe policy of clementia: it is a part of a coherent program. Whetheror not Cicero contrived the term,27he certainly shaped it in theMarc. as a policy that Caesar cannot abandon.28‘Cicero’ returns tothe point in section 12, where the virtues of justice and kindness ofspirit distinguish Caesar beyond his victories; together they insist thatCaesar’s gesture was no arbitrary act of compassion that might bethought condescending or, alternatively, might be arbitrarily aban-doned or rescinded.

It may be observed again that praise of thiskind, beyond flattering, can be considered binding on its recipient.Whether by previous agreement or to present himself as a forcefulspokesman for Caesar’s policy, Cicero, taking the rôle of advisor,shapes and defines the dictator’s post-war program of reconciliation.The audience becomes the Senate, which he addresses at section 13for the first time since the opening. His expression of Caesar’s rea-soning is one that becomes familiar in the Caesarianae; the Civil Warwas tragic, but unavoidable because fated. Adherents of Pompey,like those of Caesar, became involved because of motives that werewell intentioned, or at least free from scelus. The harshest reproachhe attaches to any of the Pompeians is temeritas (17).29This argu-ment forms the basis for exculpating Caesar’s former enemies on atleast quasi-legal grounds; whether ‘Cicero’ is expounding Caesar’srationale or he conceived it to bind Caesar is uncertain. Addressingthe Senate, Caesar’s advisor commits his leader to the position thatfrom this Civil War there emerge no enemies. For political purposeshe denies charity for anyone, but insists that Caesar bears malicetowards none.Just as he had done in the exordium, at 14–15 ‘Cicero’ introduceshimself, his position, and his experience into the argument. He pro-jects his own sponsorship of peace onto Marcellus, asserting that hehad been identically disposed.30And so, by pardoning first Cicero,now Marcellus, Caesar reveals his affinity for peacemakers.31In thiscontext a traditional advocate’s tactic32becomes a potent challengeto Caesar to continue to treat his policy of clementiaas reflective andpolitical, not just a gesture of personal kindness.33Pompeians (and Caesarians) emerge from this argument guiltless;Caesar’s status is enhanced. After praising himself and Marcellus (16)as pacifists, ‘Cicero’ expands to a further laus Caesaris (17–8), themost extravagant of the speech, in which he contrasts Caesar with29Already at section 13: ignoratione potius et falso atque inani metu quam cupiditate autcrudelitate.30He so describes Marcellus, with some justification, in a letter of this periodFam. 4.7.2.31Maluisse se non dimicare quam vinceremakes a strong and memorable slogan.32At Deiot. 12 and Lig . 28, but in aid of different strategies; see below, 238,248, 262.33So M. von Albrecht, “Ciceros Rede für Marcellus.

Certainly one of Cicero’s goalsin this speech is to glorify Caesar, either because he believes it orbecause Caesar is the best hope for restoration of a some form ofRepublic or because he hopes to work with him or because Caesarhad co-opted him or some of these reasons or all.With a pair of imperatives, gaude in section 19 and noli...defeti-gariin section 20, ‘Cicero’ shifts tone and tempo from the essentiallygratulatory spirit of the first half of the speech34to the admonitoryurgency of the second, pressing Caesar to take steps necessary forthe restoration of the republic and for lasting personal glory. Theadvisor becomes at once more intimate, and more dominating. Attimes it may be difficult to imagine the speaker raising in a publicforum some of the personal matters he addresses, unless they respondto points Caesar had made earlier on this occasion. At times thetone that ‘Cicero’ takes in exhorting the most powerful man in theworld may seem excessively bold; but, by remaining in character,he asserts his independence and frankness,—qualities essential in acredible advisor.With section 21 ‘Cicero’ turns his attention from the public imageof Caesar to the psychology of the inner man. He patronizes Caesar’sparanoia and shrugs offhis fear of physical attack with a terse, dis-missive, and largely disingenuous argument: ‘you have no more oppo-nents.’ The presentation is brilliant—both pithy and specious. Onemay ask whether Cicero expected Caesar to be convinced by thelogic or struck by the rhetoric. Humoring his leader’s anxiety, ‘Cicero’argues in much more measured periods that all men realize thattheir survival depends on his.35But this very point, elicited seemingly to comfort, raises in theabstract a political problem: the life of a Republic should not relyon any individual. It is hard to imagine that Caesar would not feelsome sting in this sententia.36Cicero may have wished for Caesar toresign his dictatorship, hardly a subject to pursue on this occasion.In a moment ‘Cicero’ will argue Caesar out of even considering it.34For the first time ‘Cicero’ treats the republic as a reality: de nobis quos in republica tecum simul esse voluisti. This may qualify the characterization of G. Petrone,“La parola e l’interdetto. Nota alla Pro rege Deiotaroe alle orazioni cesariane,” Studidell’ Istituto di filologia latina dell’ Università di Palermo6 (1978): 89, of section 19 as thefirst example of Latin panegyric.35See Suet.

To specific governmental reforms,he adds the principal necessity of political healing, which only Caesarcan bring about. And ‘Cicero’ insists unequivocally that both lead-ers accept responsibility for the excesses of Civil War. By thus pub-licly challenging Caesar, ‘Cicero’ maintains his personaas an independentadvisor. Parity also reduces the sting of lavishing clementia; and Caesar’spolicy has always been to minimize and limit blame (see Lig. 33).‘Cicero’ again probes the psychological disposition of Caesar, whohad spoken of himself as having fulfilled the expectations of bothpublic and private life:Satis diu vixi vel naturae vel gloriae. It is uncer-tain how often and in what company Caesar so expressed himselfand to what purpose.37Sincerity cannot be discounted, for his healthwas not good (Suet. DJ45). Suetonius (DJ86) implies he confidedthis to intimates; ‘Cicero’ (25) claims to have heard Caesar repeatit frequently—perhaps even earlier on this occasion. ‘Cicero’ prob-ably would not have raised the point in so public a forum if hethought Caesar would object to being argued out of it. The rejec-tion of this resolve, especially by a republican, is in itself flattering.But the way ‘Cicero’ expresses himself is abrasive.He brusquely questions the depth of the philosophical foundationof Caesar’s rationale for retiring. The superlatives of ‘that mostfamous and philosophical phrase of yours’ (25) are ironic, if nottinged with sarcasm. ‘Cicero’ picks holes in Caesar’s logic in a seriesof impatient, unanswerable questions on the subjective meaning ofsatis, modus, and parum. In terse, pressingly interrogative, ellipticalarguments he dismisses sibiand gloriaeof Caesar’s formula as irrele-vant—although a rebuke for selfishness (‘Don’t be philosophical atour expense.’) is not absent—, compared with the demands of patriae.‘Cicero’ teases his interlocutor for his vanity: ‘You won’t deny that,for all your philosophy, you’re avid for glory.’ This ‘Cicero’ knowshis man too well to allow a disclaimer. The line of repartee he attrib-utes to Caesar, ‘Do you claim, then, that our legacy is insufficientlylarge?’ (26), was itself feisty and arch. Dictator and advisor are por-trayed in a blunt disquisition between equals, in which parry meets37C.’s language at Prov. Cons. 35 foreshadows Caesar’s: cum vero ille suae gloriaeiam pridem rei publicae nondum satis fecerit.232 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 232"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"thrust.38This becomes part of ‘Cicero’s persona that emerged at sec-tion 1939of a more aggressive, demanding advisor.Earlier ‘Cicero’ was satisfied to elevate Caesar’s clementiato a polit-ical virtue which would outshine his military successes. Now he sug-gests that posterity’s response to all Caesar’s attainments to date,including clementia, will be mere admiration: glory will come only ifand when Caesar has restored the Republic (section 26 fin), whichmust therefore be key to Caesar’s program. ‘Cicero’s’ tone contin-ues frank and independent, sometimes even harsh and impatient.‘Then, if you wish, when you’ve paid your debt to your nation andcompleted the natural expectations of a full life’ are the conditionsof Caesar’s freedom to retire. Initial ‘then’ is emphatic, but ‘if youwish’ is dismissive: ‘then, but only then, you can do what you please.’The individual must serve the state to the extent he is needed andthen becomes expendable. This harsh reality is a fundamental Romantenet; and the compact ends only with a man’s death. But now‘Cicero’ undercuts even that by observing that Caesar does not seta limit by life itself, but looks on to immortality. Service to the state,i.e. restoring the republic, becomes a requisite, potentially onerousand painful, for a personal goal: immortality.There is nothing subtle or indirect about the view of Caesar med-itating his place in history. This is not a plea for continued service,but a demand—a demand, ‘Cicero’ is swift to point out, that hasits origin in the dictator’s own vanity. We have heard this before,40but ‘Cicero’ does not now elicit the petitions of a dependent popu-lation or the needs of the state, but makes it clear that Caesar’ssense of himself demands immortality of reputation. He binds Caesarto this analysis by the enthusiasm with which he subscribes to it:‘This, I say, thisis your life whichwill thrive in the memory of alltimes, whichposterity will enhance, whicheternity itself will guard.’There are in the pursuit of immortality no laurels on which to rest;the successes on which four triumphs have been predicated are amere concessive to future conditions: ‘But unless Rome has beenmade stable by you policies, your name may wander far and wide,but it will have no fixed base’ (section 29).38So Dyer (1990): 18 on the ‘elegant intellectual and rhetorical game of retortion.’39Not necessarily at odds with C.’s own; see Att. 9.15.

Caesar’seternal fame will depend entirely on the judgment of a disinterestedposterity that only the successful political resolution of the war canaffect. The problem is how to control that debate. This is a cleverand effective observation, envisioning men yet unborn determininghistory’s verdict. ‘Cicero’ has moved from urging clementiaas the con-dition of Caesar’s glory at section 20 to exhorting Caesar to look tohis place in history (section 29): ‘Therefore look also to those judgeswho will judge you in centuries to come.’ This is political advicewith a distinctly personal touch.Abruptly, in section 30 ‘Cicero’ returns to the present. He repeatslanguage earlier developed to exculpate all participants of the CivilWar,41 which entitled ex-Pompeians to pardon. Bonitasis describedas the force motivating reconciliation, disarming the passions of thosewho had been disarmed of weapons (section 32).42The point thatCaesar has no enemies apparently reminds him of his argument atsection 22; he assures Caesar that he has only adoring partisans.Now, as if it had been the purpose of his entire oration, ‘Cicero’does what is expected of a senator in deliberation. Anticlimacticallyand almost perfunctorily, ‘Cicero’ proposes a bodyguard consistingnot merely of a military escorts, but of members of the Senate itself.This, amounting to a pledge of support and affirmation of the dic-tator by the Roman Senate, seems to be ‘Cicero’s’ sententia.In his peroration ‘Cicero’ finally comes to the gratulatio,the offeringof thanks to Caesar for pardoning Marcellus—speaking for all in thename of the Senate and the Roman people; but also, as he had atthe beginning of the speech, in his own name as a friend and patronof Marcellus. He has shown his fidelity to his order and his friend,as he has paid the leader of the world the respect of forthrightnessand a measured independence.Gelzer (1968) says: ‘the main significance of the speech is that itgives expression to Cicero’s own political programme’ (280). It maydo less, if Cicero is articulating Caesar’s policy. But it certainly doesmore. It suggests that Caesar has at his disposal as an advisor to his4131: Perfuncta res publica est hoc misero fatalique bello; cf. 13: ad illa arma fato sumusnescio quo rei publicae misero funestoque compulsi.42Sed iam omnis fracta dissensio est armis, exstincta aequitate victoris.234 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 234"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"regime an orator-politician-statesman of experience and perspicacity,one who, however grateful he may be for Caesar’s pardon of Marcellus,retains the independence to advise him dispassionately and wherenecessary critically, certainly eloquently. For Cicero it may have rep-resented an opportunity to return to the corridors of power for thefirst time since 63, be it as political advisor or publicist.Pro Q. LigarioThe opening passages of the Marc. resounded with references to theday on which Caesar appeared to take a great step towards restor-ing theRes publica. Cicero’s letter to Sulpicius Rufus reflected hispleasure and optimism. That day in late 46 may have seemed noless auspicious to Cicero when he entered the Forum to speak inbehalf of Q. Ligarius. It is true that Caesar had done little of sub-stance since the Marc.to restore the Republic. The Senate met, butthe Senate was his. And Caesar had spent much of the interveningtime in North Africa. It is further true that whatever was being trans-acted in the law courts, they no longer played the vital political rolethat had catapulted Cicero to success. It is also true, that Caesarwould be sole judge of the proceedings. But for the first time sincethe end of 52 Cicero would have a public audience for a speech—his beloved corona.43It has been argued that it was an embittered Cicero who pledLig., because the fact that the case was being tried meant that Caesar,after apparent acquiescence, had rejected his argument (Marc. 13)absolving Pompeians of criminality.44But Caesar’s announcement ofa pardon preceded Cicero’s arguments in the Marc. More impor-tant, perhaps, the assumption that a lawyer and politician like Cicerowould be crushed if Caesar did not adhere to his utopian hope getslittle support from what we know of Cicero’s resilience.43It may be argued, however, that he evoked the coronaless in Lig, than in Deiot.44So Loutsch (1974) and “Ironie et Liberté de Parole: Remarques sur l’exordead Principemdu Pro Ligariode Cicéron,” Revue des Études Latines62 (1984): 399–402,adducing the comment in Sch.

This sounds more extreme than(9.1.14), where Quint. defines oratio figurata: schema quo aliud simulatur dici quam dici-tur; cf.

Q. Ligarius, a member of a Sabine fam-ily of equites, had gone to Africa in 50 as legate to the duly appointedproconsul, C. Considius. When his principal returned to Rome inearly 49 to stand for consul, Ligarius remained and was executinghis duties when war broke out. C. Attius Varus, a former proprae-tor of Africa, arrived with a part of Pompey’s army and took overthe governance of the province; Ligarius stayed on in a subordinaterole. Later the Senate sent L. Aelius Tubero to replace Considius.Probably following orders,45though Cicero does not use this as anexcuse, Ligarius kept L. Tubero from landing, re-supplying his ship,or even disembarking his ailing son, Quintus. The Tuberos went onto Thrace and joined Pompey at Pharsalus; Ligarius remained inAfrica, fought Caesar at Thapsus in 46, and was there captured.Caesar spared him, but, perhaps angered by the tenacity of the oppo-sition (see Fam. 6.13.3.), perhaps as an example to Pompeians stillresisting in Spain, forbade his return to Italy.After Caesar’s return to Rome on July 25, 46, Cicero, consistentwith his general efforts, worked assiduously to secure a pardon forQuintus. InFam. 6.14 he wrote his client of his difficulties in pro-ceeding —a claim that owes more to a desire to assure him of hisefforts than to any special indignities imposed by Caesar (paceMcDermott [1970]: 322). He appealed to Caesar in his own home,while Quintus’ brothers lay prostrate at the dictator’s feet. Suchhistrionic petitions were not rare, and Cicero was satisfied with hisperformance and its reception. ‘Cicero’ refers to this emotional peti-tion at Lig. 14 as he imagines the Tuberos heartlessly bursting in onit to urge Caesar to withhold his pity. No evocation of Caesar’sclementiain the Marc. is so fraught with emotion.Soon after, Q. Tubero applied to Caesar for permission to pros-ecute Ligarius and Caesar consented. It is difficult to imagine theactual event and the roles played by its principals. Taking advan-tage of privilege enjoyed by a dictator (see n. 3, above), Caesarallowed the trial to be held, assigned it a venue in the Forum, andpresided over it as sole judge. Plutarch (Cic. 39.7) alleges that Caesar’smotive for proceeding46was the sheer pleasure of hearing the ora-45Caesar (B.C.1.30–31) claimed Varus was responsible for the refusal of landfall.46‘C.’ opines that Caesar’s reaction to Q. Tubero’s petition at 17 was amaze-ment; but he offers no explanation for Caesar’s decision to allow the case to proceed.236 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 236"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"tor again after so long a hiatus,47though he had no intention ofpardoning his enemy. But, he claims, Caesar was so moved by thepower of the oratory that he was obliged to acquit.Most scholars reject Plutarch48on the ground that Caesar was notemotional, a judgment with which the account of Caesar weepingon news of Pompey’s death (Plut. Caes. 48) does not accord. It is,however, unlikely that Caesar would have devoted to a mere jeud’esprit the one public trial he is known to have adjudicated duringhis dictatorship. The fact is that, without the approval of Caesar,the Lig. would not have taken place. If Caesar allowed a public trial,he probably did so for a political purpose, from which no momen-tary twinge caused by an orator’s art would have dissuaded him.Although Q. Ligarius did have a knack for placing himself in thethick of things, if this was political theater to exhibit Caesar’s treat-ment of his foes, he does not seem so central a Pompeian that hispublic trial would serve any exemplary political purpose, whateverits outcome.49Equally surprising as prosecutor was Q. Aelius Tubero,son of Lucius and member of a consular plebeian gens until recentlyassociated less with politics than the study of history. The father, whohad served in Asia as legate to Q. Cicero in 58, shared with Ciceroa long friendship, interest in the fine arts,50and a preference forPompey’s side in the Civil War. He also was connected to Ciceroby marriage. The Senate assigned him the province of Africa in 50.Kept from landing there, he joined Pompey at Pharsalus and re-turned to Rome with a pardon from Caesar. His son Quintus trav-eled with his father, was ill during the African indignity, but sufficiently47The recent delivery of the Marc. does not refute the story.

Aelius Tubero was a fledgling ora-tor for whom this was to be his last case.52If Caesar was directing a show-trial, it is striking that the prose-cutors, too, were dedicated Pompeians, at least until his defeat atPharsalus, though apparently Quintus did contrast himself and hisfather with Ligarius in his speech.53‘Cicero’s’ opening concession tothe charge that Ligarius had been in Africa is ironic because itapplied equally to all other Pompeians who had migrated to thatprovince;54—all, that is to say, but the Tuberos, who had been pre-vented from landing. Cicero’s attacks on the Tuberos in Lig. seemto have occasioned a froideur, but no lasting break with the elderTubero.55On the basis of his earlier appeal, Cicero was an obvious enoughchoice to defend Ligarius. The political value of this ever-popularshowman would not have been lost on Caesar, who had always beenwell-disposed towards Cicero as a man of politics and of letters, andwas now engaged in a cordial, if formal relationship with him. (SeeMarc. 6, above.) Among intimates of Caesar’s who had become apart of Cicero’s social and intellectual life was C. Vibius Pansa, withwhom Cicero shared the defense of Ligarius and whom he calls meusnecessarius. Caesar must have ordered or agreed to this collaboration.The specific charge brought against Ligarius remains in question.56‘Cicero’ pretends that he had been accused merely of having beenin Africa, a self-evident fact. From Quintilian’s citation of Tubero’sspeech (11.1.80) we learn more of his charge: that, though the dis-sention between Pompey and Caesar was an internal matter, a dig-nitatis contentio, Ligarius conspired with a foreign monarch and nationhostile to the Roman state.57Whether this led to a charge of maies-51‘C.’s account of it (9), which impressed Plutarch, has a great deal of theaterand should not be taken entirely seriously; see Gotoff(1993): 128–29.52Dig. 1.2.2.46. His later distinction as jurisconsult suggests he was not quite ashapless as C. makes him out to be. Quint. had a copy of his speech against Q. Ligarius.53See below, n. 57.54But see R. Bauman, The “Crimen Maiestatis” in the Roman Republic and AugustanPrincipate( Johannesburg: Witwatersrand University Press 1967): 144.55So Att. 13.20.2, written some four months later.56Good, if inconclusive discussions in Bauman (1967): 144–47 and K. Bringmann,“Der Diktator Caesar als Richter?” Hermes114 (1986): 74–79.57Q. Tubero said that, as a youth, he was with his father, whom the Senate238 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 238"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"tasorperduellio, or that it was either, is not certain. Both would tech-nically require the presence of the accused at trial and both wouldbe capital.58But Cicero argues (sections 12–13) that death was notthe punishment sought, but was rather the logical result of pursuinga man already in exile. The charge that Ligarius had dealt with anenemy of Rome seems not to have persuaded Caesar. Cicero nevermentions it.The more serious allegations may have fallen to Pansa, but theforce of the prosecutor’s contention should not be overestimated. Hemay have had his own difficulties developing a convincing argumentthat his loyalty to Pompey was any less culpable than Ligarius’ orthat his father’s motive in going to Africa during the Civil War wasin no way military.59He would also have had to allay the suspicionthat their opposition to Ligarius was inflamed by a private dispute,a querela(23).Beyond the principals and the charge, the purpose of the trialCaesar approved raises questions. It took place against the back-ground of his policy already in practice of reconciling with his oppo-sition through personal pardons.Some say Lig.was argued merelyto demonstrate the dictator’s clementia, or to show it working even inthe face of the persistent enmity of a Ligarius;60others that it wasconceived to condemn this man for anti-Caesarian activity (whichPompeians like Varus and Labienus were planning to continue per-petrating in Spain), in order to frighten dissidents into abandoningtheir opposition.61A subsequent pardon, to extend this theory, mighthave underlined Caesar’s misericordia. Against the exemplary value ofa convicting Ligarius are his comparative obscurity and the weak-ness of the prosecutor’s position, as well as the fact that Caesaracquitted him.had sent not to fight but to buy grain and who left the Pompeians as soon as hecould.58So T. Mommsen, Römisches Staatsrecht(Leipzig: S. Hertzel 1887); refs. in Bauman(1967): 147.59Quint. 11.1.78 speaks directly to precisely this difficulty.60So G. Walser, “Der Prozess gegen Q.

A variety of political sce-narios mentioned above focus on making of Ligarius a particularobject lesson to a particular group. Perhaps Caesar arranged thispublic trial to show Romans that under his government trials forredress of grievances could take place. If so, he did not make a prac-tice of it. The only other trial known to have been held under hisprerogatives as Dictator was argued out of the public eye. As ‘Cicero’argues, such procedures threaten terrible consequences. The liabilityof the Pompeian prosecutor has no more obvious function than thatto which Cicero puts it—to stigmatize the pursuit of personal vengeanceas unpatriotic and to distinguish the vengeful Tuberos from otherpardoned Pompeians. The point that emerges (section 15):—‘howmany victors would want you to be harsh, when so many of thevanquished seem to?’—if generalized to urge all to refrain from pur-suing vendettas, may be enough to justify the trial.Cicero seems to be enjoying himself and inviting Caesar to enjoythe pleading of the case. A reading of the text may suggest thatCicero was treating Lig. as a tour-de-force, to remind Caesar of hisoratorical skills as well as his ability to deliver cogent and forcefullyexpressed advice, in case the dictator might wish either. But that isnot a reason for Caesar to have staged the trial.Craig (1984): 195 has put most succinctly the theoretical problemof the Lig. as a criminal trial. As judge Caesar should not dispenseclementia, but adjudicate the case on its legal merits,62while as a con-ciliatory dictator, he had the power and the political need to offerclementia. But Cicero had pled for clementiabefore judges, e.g., Mil.92. And in this case, he defended his client’s voluntastowards Caesarand his innocence of the act that provoked the Tuberos, while alsoarguing that no crime took place. In the end, he does not addressthe legal problem of Caesar’s position, which modern scholars seeas a difficulty, anymore than he is troubled in the Marc. by the moralimplications of offering pardon to fellow citizens.62Of the argument that no Roman had the right to extend clementiato anotherfree-born Roman there is no trace in the Lig.240 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 240"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"M. Tulli Ciceronis Pro Ligario OratioThe traditional purpose of the exordium of a judicial speech is for thepatron to introduce himself and present his view of the nature anddemands of the case in an ornamental but controlled expository stylein order to win the good will of the judge(s). The exordium of theLig.violates those principles. It is a masterpiece of cheerful confidencedisguised as unremitting panic, conveyed by obvious exaggeration,self-parody,63and sophistic argumentation, suggesting the absurdityand inconsequence of the case before Caesar. The tone of the exordium,was admired in antiquity by Quintilian (4.1.70): divina illa pro Ligarioironia.The speaker of Pro Ligariobursts forth in utter confusion becausehis intended line of defense has been nullified by his colleague’s fataladmission that their client had been in Africa, although Caesar hadcaptured Ligarius there and was keeping him there in exile. Heblames his predicament unequivocally on his fellow counsel, Caesar’sown friend, Pansa, and confesses that he cannot think of anotherexpedient,64because his intended strategy—to lie to the judge rely-ing on his ignorance—has been exposed by the brilliance of theprosecution. This is how Cicero presents himself, brazenly admittinghis disrespect for the judge to the judge Caesar. His decision to puthis client’s fate in the hands of Caesar is occasioned purely by expe-dience. He even manages to diminish Caesar’s misericordia, by limit-ing its application to minor infractions: ‘by which many have beensaved, having sought of you and gained not acquittal of a crime,but absolution of an indiscretion.’ One might have expected an argu-mentum a minori.The wit of the exordiumdepends on the assumption that the judgewas likely to appreciate the situation as Cicero conceived it. ‘Cicero’was arguing before a man of infinite power, who was also thoughtand probably thought himself to be a consummate public speakervery nearly on a par with Cicero. It is not surprising, under thesecircumstances, to find the orator, even as he enlists the time-honoredmethods of rhetorical persuasion, deferring to his judge’s pretensionsby conceding Caesar’s ability to see through them. An orator always63On the histrionics of quo me vertam nescio,see Gotoff(1993): 108–09.64Aporia, a technique equally at home in comedy and tragedy, is capable of con-veying either pathos or humor; see Gotoff(1993): 108.’  241MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 241"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"flatters his audience as being too smart to be deceived by lawyers’tricks.65The strategy by which he conveys his openness to Caesaris to treat him collegially, even admitting his plan to lie to him.66He cannot allow Caesar to believe that the strategy of deprecatioisessentially sincere.Thus does ‘Cicero’ introduce himself and his analysis of thedifficulties of pleading the case.67He immediately associates himselfpersonally with the Tuberos, père et fils, and with Pansa,68and Pansawith Caesar. The admission of such intimacies makes the case seemless momentous.69He reveals his confusion, admits a contemptuouswillingness to deceive the judge, stipulates his client’s guilt, promptlythrows himself on that judge’s mercy with a less-than-generous com-pliment, and, practically in the same breath, accuses the prosecu-tor—and his father—of greater culpability! The shift, with an abruptand masterful reversal of tone, to an aggressive éntikathgor¤a70pro-vides an unexpected and powerful climax to the exordium. The ora-tor, having winked at Caesar with his rhetorical burlesque, nowproceeds to business: to exonerate his client, impeach the prosecu-tor, and persuade Caesar to persevere in his policy of clementia.71In a carefully composed narrative (section 2b–6) suggesting tight65That he boasted of deceiving the judgesin the Cluent. we know from Quint.2.17.21.

Years later he allowed (fin. 4.74)that his arguments in Mur.were trifling, because the judges were imperitiand hewas playing to the crowd.66Twice more in the Lig. ‘C.’ treats lies as rhetorically negotiable: at 16, he pon-ders a sympathetic and noble lie, and 25 will stipulate to Tubero’s lie, which helpsLigarius. In all three cases it is disarming to discuss such strategies with the manmeant to be deceived.67See A. Primmer, Cicero Numerosus, Sitzungsberichte der Österreichische Akademieder Wissenschaften, philosophisch-historische Klasse, 257 (Wien: Böhlau 1968):317–18, on rhythm. Loutsch (1974): 403, on the alliteration qualified by Cael. 77,does not consider that the tone is part of the burlesque.68His disparaging treatment of Pansa’s ‘rashness’ is mitigated by the clear incon-sequence of the ‘admission.’ Loutsch’s reading (1974): 403–04 of Cic.’s tone as bit-terly sarcastic, stemming from his disappointment with Caesar, cannot be correct.69McDermott (1970) points out that the only principal to whom he does not tiehimself is Ligarius.70An extended attack on the Tuberos which dominates the bulk of the speech.71C. repeatedly returns to humor based on an appreciation, shared with Caesar,of oratorical manipulation.

He lingers with exces-sive specificity over the early and innocent period of Ligarius’ Africansojourn. Only when the orator breaks offat section 6 does it becomeclear that he included no detail of his client’s anti-Caesarian activ-ities. He quickly concedes that by remaining after Varus arrived,Ligarius may have done something indictable, but only by necessity,not desire. ‘Cicero’ offers no rationale, but insists emotionally72thatLigarius could not have been motivated by personal animus againstCaesar.With a sudden transition, ‘Cicero’ breaks offone rhetorical strat-egy for another. There has been no mention of African oppositionto Caesar or of Ligarius’ relations with the African leader, Juba.This kind of argumentation invites the question of the beneficiaryof this persiflage. The first answer must be Caesar; however muchCicero enjoyed playing to the crowd, only one judgment counted.Caesar might have delighted in the argument precisely because ofits persuasive inanity. This is not to imply that Cicero was tryingmerely to divert Caesar. Rather he is maintaining a rapport betweenorator and judge based on respect for Caesar’s ability to appreciatethese rhetorical tricks without any mistrust that the orator was try-ing to confound him. Here one master is invited by another mas-ter to be amused by and admire his work. If he could sustain Caesar’sadmiration for his oratorical talents, Cicero might better dispose himto countenance ‘Cicero’s’ political advice and to conclude that Cicerowas suitable to publicize or inform the dictator’s political agenda.At 6 ‘Cicero’ abruptly stops his narrative—well short of estab-lishing the greater culpability he alleged of the Tuberos. Instead, heproclaims, in the manner of a patronus, a link between himself andhis client: his own Pompeian sympathies. This lets him praise Caesarnot only for his pardon, but for restoring his former dignitas. He thusprovides himself as a precedent for Caesar to extend similar clemen-tiato Ligarius.73He further uses the laudatio Caesarisas a springboard for continu-ing the vituperatio Tuberonumbegun in the exordium. From 9–29 heattacks their activities and their motives in tones that range fromingratiating to condescending to devastating, from middle style expos-itory to high style passion and indignation. He questions their wisdom,72He stresses Quintus’ close fraternal ties and the hardship of separation (5 fin.).73The same tactic has a different function at 9, 28; see next paragraph.’  243MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 243"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"their motives, and most of all their humanity in trying to deterCaesar from his policy of clementia.

He compliments and identifies himselfwith them, just as he had with Ligarius, as a former Pompeian; butwith them the technique is used for denigration. He faults and cor-rects their logic, reveals their hypocrisy in prosecuting Ligarius asanti-Caesarian, and accuses Q. Tubero of personally assaulting Caesarat Pharsalus.The abrupt transition beginning in section 8, marked by the voca-tive of Tubero and a lightening shift to nominative is brilliant:‘Observe, please, Tubero, how I’m ready to speak of Ligarius’case...Besides, I said what I did about myself so that Tubero willforgive me when I speak about him.’ The speaker lulls him with aspacious compliment: ‘whose hard work and success I honor’. . . beforecoldly confronting them in section 9 with an indignant reminder oftheir virulent opposition to Caesar. This leads to a great coup dethéatre, an imaginative evocation of Tubero attacking Caesar atPharsalus that all listeners might appreciate, save two.74An epi-grammatic coda, addressed to Caesar, restores calm but reinforcesthe antithesis between Caesar’s clementiaand the crudelitasof theTuberos: ‘Shall the oratory of the very men whose absolution is yourglory urge you to brutality.’ The extended attack on the opposition,full of clever and technically admirable approaches, is punctuatedwith comment on Caesar’s policy of reconciliation.The argument that follows is another piece of oratorical fluff.‘Cicero’ had raised the specter of brutality in the aftermath of CivilWar. Now he identifies Tubero with that excess: the consequenceof his prosecution is not that Ligarius will be condemned, but thathe will be killed, since he is already in exile.75The reductioof theargument suggests that persuading Caesar to refuse clemency willproduce a result worse than death. He introduces a ‘Tubero’ to denythat intention, and uses the opportunity to point out in a patroniz-ing, if apparently sympathetic, voice his opponent’s faulty logic andinsensitivity as well. At section 13 he turns to fate-worse-than-death74Analyzed by Gotoff(1993): 128–29, and in “Oratory: The Art of Illusion,”Harvard Studies in Classical Philology95 (1993): 298, 303–04.75It is unlikely that a conviction of Ligarius would have entailed more than con-tinued exile.244 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 244"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"argument: ‘What is the punishment but death?

The effect of this argument might be to dis-comfort the opposition, but to amuse Caesar, who understands itsstructure. What is seriously ‘harsher’ is the damage the prosecutoris doing to Caesar’s reputation for misericordia. The section closes withanother handsome period containing implicit political advice: ‘Howmuch harsher is this: to attack in the Forum what we pled for atyour home and amidst the general misery to destroy the sanctuaryof compassion.’‘Cicero,’ now in the role of advisor (section 15), expresses himselfwith an evident candor76and warns Caesar of the deleterious polit-ical effect of abandoning that policy. It would open the floodgatesto vengeance-seekers among his own supporters, whose claims arestronger than those of former Pompeians—an observation that wouldhave already occurred to Caesar. Certainly, there is no pretense thatthis argument would respond to a charge of perduellioor maiestas,against his client.77Another handsomely composed period makes thepolitical point: ‘How many men by not wanting you to forgive any-one would hinder your clementia, when the same men you forgavedon’t want you to be merciful towards others?’ The very logic ofthe advice convicts Tubero.To emphasize the necessity of maintaining Caesar’s program,‘Cicero’ claims (section 16) that a noble lie denying Ligarius’ presencein Africa would be preferable to a harmful admission. The notionof paltering with the truth to a worthy purpose would not shock;78discussing the strategy with the opposition in front of the judge iscomic.

But the orator’s tone is powerful and passionate and his vision very nearlya threat: ‘if your mercy were not so great, this victory of yours would be awashwith the most bitter grief.’77Similarly, the disposition C. urges for Deiotarus (see below) is argued on groundsother than his innocence or guilt of the charge of attempted murder.78Quint. countenances it at 4.2.89–94.’  245MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 245"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"who was in the same circumstances,’ he turns frivolity into a harshattack on Tubero.Switching to Caesar, who allowed Tubero’s request to proceedagainst Ligarius, he imagines the actual postulatioand succinctlyassumes Caesar’s reaction: ‘No doubt you were amazed that he wasnot prosecuting someone else, or that the prosecutor was someonein the same boat, or that he was raising some bizarre charge.’ It isshameless of Tubero to pursue a Pompeian in the courts. ‘Cicero’will attribute it to unworthy, private motives.He presents an argument previously expressed at Marc. 13 and31, making a rhetorically useful point for bringing about a concordafter Civil War.79There was no crime, only mistakes, no villains,only degrees of victims; some kind of fatal calamity appears to haveinfected the improvident minds of people. To support such musingsno legal arguments are made, no historical examples offered; thebest reason to accept this premise is that it offers a rationale forabsolving both sides of culpability. Following a rhetorical peak of thespeech in section 18, with sympathetic evocations of dead Pompeiansand of soldiers loyal to Caesar and his dignitas, ‘Cicero’ moves to anargument that puts Caesar on the defensive: ‘Tell me: when youwere pursuing peace, was it to reach agreement with criminals orgood citizens?’ Leaving no room for response, he insists, with rhetor-ical indignation (19) ‘I would feel less grateful if I believed Caesarhad pardoned me as a criminal’ and generalizes: ‘And how wouldyou have served the state if you wanted so many criminals restoredto their former status?’ ‘Cicero’ deprives Caesar’s gesture of muchof its humanitas.In tandem with the clever rhetorical ploys that marked the firstinvective against his opponents is the bold, critical voice alreadyheard in the Marc. that does not fear to challenge Caesar. ‘Cicero’becomes more assertive and critical. Recalling Caesar’s descriptionof the conflict as more a divorce than a Civil War, he insists thatwhile the claims of the leaders might have been equal, the status oftheir followers was not. ‘Cicero’ puts it delicately, but the meaningis clear: Pompey represented more ‘good men.’ In the end, Caesar’s79Craig (1984) argues that a weak argument in 17–19 is placed deliberately atthe center of the speech to bury it. But rhetorically, as part of ‘C.’s consiliumtoCaesar, this argument, bursting into the midst of the vituperatiothat dominates ‘C.’sdeprecatio, is anything but unobtrusive.246 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 246"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"side was ratified by the gods. What confirms his victory is his pol-icy of clementia: ‘Once your clemency was discerned who would notendorse that victory in which no one died unless in arms?’ caps theargument and might have capped the main body of the speech.Instead, ‘Cicero’ returns to his opponents with another extendedinvective that repeatedly appears to offer Tubero warmth and sym-pathy only to withdraw it suddenly and harshly. He produces a dra-matic dialogue in which the Tuberos claim to having been doingtheir duty,80and appears to accept the excuse, until, with a devas-tating twist he suddenly turns on his friend: ‘but I do not agree thatyou can criticize in others what you boast of for yourselves.’ As ifhe had not just delivered himself of this objectionable remark, heallies himself with the elder Tubero (21); he accepts Lucius’ avowalthat he had preferred to stay at home,81but faced intolerable pres-sures (22). Once more abandoning him (23), ‘Cicero’ insists thatLucius was following his own political inclinations: ‘The departedwith those whose cause he shared.’ The father got to Africa neitherreluctant nor passive, but incensed to find his place usurped—forwhich he wrongly blames Ligarius. Each argument not only rejectsTubero’s position, but assails his motives and isolates him even fromother Pompeians, insisting that this is the real, unprincipled basis ofthe prosecution—a personal complaint, in fact, a querela stemmingfrom iraat having been forbidden to land.‘Cicero’s’ attack on the Tuberos is devastating, but it is also mas-terly, and self-consciously so. If Tubero blames Ligarius for pre-venting his father from taking command, he will find himself on thehorns of a dilemma, an embarrassing spot where orators delight inplacing opponents.82Either he wished to retain the province for80‘C.’ is here responding to Q. Tubero’s account of his and his father’s anti-Caesarian activities as reported by Quintilian.81Comparison of the motives and behavior of Ligarius and the Tuberos maystem from Tubero’s own argument (10): ‘You accuse a man who has a better casethan yours, as I assert, or, if you prefer, equal’ may indicate that Tubero concededa similarity between their activities until Ligarius joined Juba.82C. Craig, Form as Argument in Cicero’s Speeches: A Study of Dilemma (Atlanta: ScholarsPress 1993), shows that this figure beyond most others is a dazzling demonstrationof an orator’s technical superiority over an opponent—calling attention to his swiftand devastating wit. He analyzes (170, n. 20) this dilemma as a logical argumentto defeat Tubero, rather than as a self-consciously clever rhetorical flourish to amuseCaesar.’  247MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 247"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Pompey or to deliver it to Caesar.83Neither alternative is tenable,entailing either wanting to lead the resistance to Caesar or of beingwilling to betray his own Senatorial imperium.84The dilemma routsthe Tuberos rhetorically: ‘behold, Caesar, what freedom, or ratheraudacity, your liberality has given us.’ ‘Cicero’ drops any pretext ofsympathy with the prosecution at section 24 with a pre-emptivedenial of one alternative of the dilemma, insisting that the Tuberos,contrary to their protestations and out of personal pique, exceededthe demands of loyalty to Pompey.With another initial profession of empathy, ‘Cicero’ establishes thefervor of Tubero’s support for Pompey in the war by equating itwith his own,85but at once brands his opponent’s position as moreextreme: ‘You certainly <favored war> having reached a point whereyou’d be ruined if you didn’t win,’ and finally mocks the sincerityof Tubero’s conviction: ‘though, as things stand, I’m sure you’d pre-fer this pardon to that victory.’ Once again ‘Cicero’ positions him-self close to Tubero only to embarrass him and leave him in theunlovely position of appearing to be pressuring Caesar, who has for-given his own enemies, to destroy his.Deprecatio86At section 29 ‘Cicero’ announces with a rhetorical flourish that every-thing he has said is directed to one end: an appeal to Caesar’shumanity. But in the 28 sections since he turned out of desperationto the strategy of deprecatio, he has not used it. And between hereand the peroratioat 37, there is scant reference to it. Instead, ‘Cicero’meditates on clementia, assumes a rapport with Caesar stemming fromhis professional parity, exercises ingenuity in developing arguments,and even analyzes Caesar as a critic of defense oratory; only brieflydoes he resort to deprecatio. This is predominantly a discussion of theart of oratory.83‘C.’s descriptions of the province at 22 and 24 make clear what he thinks ofanyone desiring that province.84The second shrewdly forces on Caesar a judgment that does him credit: ‘Foreven if you appreciated the gesture, you would not have approved it.’85Section 28.

The judicial problem some moderns per-ceive in Caesar’s dual role as judge and ruler does not concern‘Cicero,’ who neither considers the judge disinterested nor allowshim so to consider himself.As often when in a familiar, collegial mode and pondering rhetor-ical strategies, ‘Cicero’ adds sophisticated humor. He boasts that hecould have mounted a defense of Ligarius and ventures, as a sam-ple of how a lawyerly defense might run, an obvious echo of whathe had in fact argued at section 2f. Having opted to plead for mercy,he insists that Caesar has created precedents for such a plea, addingquerulously a somewhat impudent appeal for equity (31):90‘Shall Ihave no hope for Ligarius, though I was permitted to petition youfor another?’When it looks as if a deprecatiowill begin, ‘Cicero’ pulls back (sec-tion 31) ‘though my hope for this case was not placed in my speechnor in the support of friends of yours...’ Rather he avows that ora-tory is unnecessary with Caesar,91who is not swayed by the rhetoricof advocates or their ties to him (31).92‘Cicero’ then analyzes himas a judge, asserting that facts prevail, not the authority of the advo-cate and entreaties for mercy, leaving open the possibility of a dep-recatio, if it reflects a just claim. Still he does not provide one, anymore than he produces friends and relatives of Ligarius, although87There is no known trial in which the two shared the defense.

The swelling passion of the exhortations shifts the speakerinto another mode: ‘Let that victorious voice of yours prevail.’ Somepassion remains in tone but now the exhortation is political. Heidentifies friends of Q. Ligarius present and absent,94and empha-sizes the political impact of a pardon: his grateful supporters will beCaesar’s partisans.Like the exordium, the deprecatiocontains ironic variations on a con-ventional form; and indeed at many other points in the speech‘Cicero’ appears to welcome Caesar’s interest, amusement, and admi-ration for his manipulation of associated rhetorical techniques. Thisstrategy allows him to establish a rapport most useful with a judgewho would not be moved by vulgar manipulation nor be pleased tobe subjected to it. Cicero is not getting outside the genre to applyit in a ‘metatextual’ way. Virtually all parts of a practical orationare self-conscious and deliberately manipulative variations on abstractrhetorical forms, just as no voice of the orator is ‘metatestuale’95because all are.96A first-person persona inserted into a speech is adramatic contrivance encouraged by the patron-client relationship ofRoman law,97and the ‘himself ’ Cicero injects is just another per-sona. In this case, appealing to this particular single judge, Ciceroopts for projecting familiarity, professional parity, common interestin the pleading of a case. If by so doing he can disarm Caesar andwin his goodwill, he would be well satisfied.93In all this he invites Caesar’s participation or, at least, appreciation (32):‘Consider . . .

Following on the conclusion of the last section, thatthe pardon of Ligarius would serve a public function, Cicero devel-ops a new thesis: a pardon for Ligarius would satisfy the Romanpeople in the Forum as the pardon of Marcellus did Senators in theCuria. The conceit has little substance, but it invites considerationof popular support and allows ‘Cicero’ to stress his rôle as advisor(fac...da...noli...tantum te admonebo), with an exhortation to Caesarto maintain his policy of clementia. ‘Cicero’ pleads neither for hisclient’s innocence nor for mercy, but for bonitas, the virtue of humankindness, that common people most appreciate. His final advice, ‘byreprieving that absent man you will reprieve these present,’ bringsin for the only time in the speech the corona.As with the Marc., therefore, Cicero has used an oration deliveredbefore Caesar as an opportunity to display his skills and take therôle of political advisor. Again, it is impossible to say whether he isdemonstrating his perspicacity in developing policy or his genius inpresenting it. In either case he might be valuable to Caesar.Pro Rege DeiotaroThe Pro Rege Deiotaroof November 45 is perhaps the most bafflingof Cicero’s speeches.

He remained friendly to Roman officials in the East, includingCicero in 51. As a client of Pompey and Rome, Deiotarus led hisown cavalry at Pharsalus, and retreated with Pompey, after whosedeath he shifted fealty to Caesar, sending troops to support him inAlexandria. When Mithradates’ son, Pharnaces, King of CimmerianBosphorus, took advantage of Caesar’s struggle in Egypt and laidclaim to lesser Armenia, Deiotarus sought the help of the Romanprovincial general and sent him a contingent of horsemen. Theirforces were routed by Pharnaces at Nicopolis; relief came only later,from Caesar himself.After gaining control of Alexandria, Caesar turned to Asia Minor.In Cappadocia he forgave King Ariobarzanes’ support of Pompey;his family had stayed loyal to Rome throughout the Mithradatic warsand his realm was now in danger from Pharnaces. He then contin-ued North towards Zela. Somewhere near the border with Galatia,at a meeting described in the Bell. Alex. 68, Deiotarus appeared beforethe Roman general dramatically dressed as a suppliant convict tobeg forgiveness for supporting Pompey. Caesar rejected Deiotarus’excuse that he had not been able to judge between competing forcesin Rome. Nevertheless, in view of Deiotarus’ hospitality, friendship,position, and age, he postponed deciding on the territorial disputesraised by other Galatian tetrarchs and allowed him to keep the titleof king.99From there he went on, with the king in tow, to achievehis swift victory over Pharnaces at Zela (August 2, 47) and then toaccept the tetrarch’s hospitality, before arriving at Nicaea in Bithynia.At some point, or points along the way Caesar awarded LesserArmenia to Ariobarzanes and the Eastern tetrarchy of the Trocmorialong with some of Cappadocia to Mithradates of Pergamon.100Although Caesar postponed resolving the other tetrarchs’ complaint,Deiotarus’ theatrical attire at their meeting suggests that he hadalready lost something, perhaps Lesser Armenia. Retention of histitle means he was left with something, perhaps all of Galatia.10199Cf. section 10, trans. below, 258.100At Div. 1.27 C. says that a hostile Caesar snatched away the tetrarchy of theTrocmori to give to his ‘insignificant little Eastern acolyte’ (Mithridates of Pergamon),stripped D. of Armenia, a gift of the Senate, and, having enjoyed his sumptuoushospitality, left his royal host ruined.101See D.

B.C. 3.4). His decision may havehad as much to do with rewarding others as punishing Deiotarus.104One of the beneficiaries, Mithradates of Pergamon, had for a whileenjoyed Caesar’s favor.105As to the Cappadocian and Galatian set-tlements, Caesar may truly have been offended by Deiotarus’ appear-ance in person at Pharsalus (Cic. 9)106or been convinced by theclaims of the other tetrarchs. Had he at any time during his marchthrough Asia Minor become aware of Deiotarus’ involvement in anassassination plot, he would likely not have waited two years for aninquiry.Deiotarus made several further attempts to get Caesar to restorehis lands. Upon the death of Mithradates of Pergamon in 45 hepetitioned Caesar campaigning in Spain, who replied with a reas-suring, if noncommittal message. A second delegation was in Romein November 45.107Castor, son of Tarcondarius, also pursuing ter-ritorial claims and perhaps vengeance, charged Deiotarus with hav-ing tried to kill Caesar in Galatia. Caesar held some kind of inquiry,opting to hear the case in the privacy of his own home. He sat assole judge, but is not known to have rendered a decision.102The precise format of which is unclear; see below, 265.103Loutsch (1974): 408 would have Brutus at the border in Bell. Alex. 78.

Very little is known about Castor, son of the monarchwhose tetrarchy Deiotarus, his father-in-law, had seized.109ThatCastor, a foreigner, could plead a criminal case in Rome is doubt-ful. No slave, domestic or foreign, could be a prosecutor. Foreignclients were represented by Roman patroniin provincial matters liketerritorial disputes; the Senate would be expected to hear and medi-ate complaints.110Civil matters might be brought to the praetor pere-grinus. Yet, it is strongly implied (8) that Castor and Phidippus hadsome oratorical function in the trial. ‘Cicero’ speaks scornfully oftheir rhetorical abilities; (see below).The charge was attempted assassination at his own home (15),which might have involved maiestas, perduellio, or vis.To bring a for-eign monarch to trial in Rome would have been unique, but theaccusation was apparently broader: that Deiotarus was hostile toCaesar and preparing an army to fight him. ‘Cicero’ accuses Deiotarus’Galatian rival of exploiting a personal antipathy Caesar was believedto feel for the king and rebuts not only the charges, but the per-ception of the king’s animosity. On whatever basis the charges ofpersonal animus were leveled, they are refuted at greater length thanthat of attempted murder. Castor may have wanted to portray theking as a less than reliable client for a Roman general leading anexpedition to the East.If the major charge is evanescent and some of the minor onesnugatory, the question arises why the most powerful man in theworld and one of its busiest, informed of a plot by a client to kill108P.

Somereasons advanced in the case of the Lig. for a trial can be dismissed:it would have been the opposite of a show trial; and no propagandavalue could accrue from so restricted an audience.The absence of a formal prosecutor as well as the defendant, alongwith weak charges and the absence of a verdict make the event atwhich Deiot. was delivered hard to conceive. Perhaps it was not atrial. Caesar had the broadest leeway in conducting any inquiry. Theform it actually took may have been based on the cognitio extra ordinem112by which a magistrate tries to establish the relevance of a law to acase or the veracity of charges brought.113Caesar may have chargedCicero, who as governor of Cilicia had known the king, with repre-senting Deiotarus.114Cicero seems to have had a genuine affectionand admiration for the king. But, the event also offered him thechance, as in the previous Caesarianae, of being heard by Caesar.Here, too, while defending a client, he may have been pursuingmore personal goals.115M.

He deplores aslave taking the part of accuser as deleterious to Roman morale, butnot as so outrageous as to vitiate the trial. In expressing an anxietynormal in a lawyer pleading before a suae causae iudex, he appearsto address a trial judge,116rather than a magistrate dispensing jus-tice from a tribunal.Cicero takes the rôle of an advocate pleading an anomalous casein unique circumstances before a single judge, but a judge peculiarnot only in that he is interested,117but because he too is a distin-guished orator and man of letters. In this, his strategy is similar tothat of Lig.118His character is respectful, but familiar, conceding byhis candor in revealing strategies Caesar’s parity with him. He doesnot lose heart, but deals with the presence of an interested party byturning the tables: ‘I don’t so much worry about how you want tojudge Deiotarus as I know how you want others to judge you (4).’In a certain setting Caesar’s response to this might be ‘touché.’119Compared with Lig., the structure of this speech conforms moreclosely to the textbook canon for forensic oration: exordium, partitio,narratio, refutatio, and conclusio.120Lig., lacking a true exordiumaltogether,is arguably more idiosyncratic; but, with exordiumand peroratioin Deiot.consuming sixteen of forty-three sections and the refutatiobeing inter-rupted by an extended attack on the accusers and an encomium forDeiotarus, the structure of speech may be less conventional than itsappearance.‘Cicero’s’ opening strategy establishes a rapport with Caesar bytreating him practically as his patronus, the man who can allay the116In Marc.

At first he is tentative; referring to the unexampled obliga-tion of defending a foreign king, he allows: ‘although even that isnot unreasonable, when you might be in danger’; but at this pointthe concession not wholly convincing. When he moves to the sub-ject of an interested judge, the abatement of his aporiaprovided bythe ‘Caesar’ he envisions is expressed more positively: ‘This, too,sometimes bothers me, Caesar, but when I consider you closely, myfear is alleviated.’ Now the essential injustice of the situation is allayedby Caesar’s sapientia; now the epithet iniquum, accepted as a fact, isdismissed in favor of Caesar’s fairness. A congeries of assurancesbegins to balance the fears.122Yet he makes Caesar hear in detailwhy an interested judge is usually disqualified.To address problems raised by his situation, ‘Cicero’ uses strate-gies adopted rather to amuse Caesar than overwhelm him. The dis-advantages of the present venue are considerable, but, they are putforth in a way that Caesar is unlikely to have found offensive. ‘Cicero’grants he misses the presence of a coronathat he could manipulateto convince the judge of the superiority of his case.123Instead, hereveals, he will need to approach Caesar directly, employing a differ-ent kind of rhetoric (5), precluding his use of the emotional tac-tics that have made him so successful.124The argument is valid onits face, but it becomes a rhetorical tactic when discussed with thejudge. In the end, he will assert, as at Lig. 32, that Caesar is proofagainst rhetorical persuasion (40). The problem is not to get Caesarto believe in his sincerity, but to believe rather that in using theploy Cicero is conceding his audience’s intelligence and experience,not abusing it.An unabashed admission of the orator’s ability, under normal con-ditions, to manipulate the emotions of his audience emboldens himto elicit in a praeteritiothose techniques denied to him in this case.121commoveri...perturbant...timor...conturber...extimescebam...Perturbat...Moveor...perturbationemmake an impressive list.122timere desino...metum minuit...Non...tam timeo.123The argument is not presented seriously, although Caesar would appreciatethe efficacy of a corona. In Lig. he never appeals to the corona, acknowledging themonly at the end.124Loutsch (1994): 422 suggests an allusion to a presumed stylistic debate (Atticvs. Asian) of this period that supposedly found C. and Caesar on opposite sides.His assertion that the allusion masks a ‘critique sévère’ of the venue does not follow.’  257MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 257"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"An inspiring reminder of his client’s steadfast loyalty to Rome, anevocation of symbols of Roman institutions visible to the ordinarythrong, direct appeals to the Senate house, to the Forum, to thegods themselves—such strategies, he asserts, would ensure his vic-tory. In bemoaning his inability to make such passionate appeals,Cicero elevates the emotional level. ‘Cicero’ facetiously urges Caesarto imagine the sympathetic reaction to the king he could elicit froma corona, and, judging its potential from his own experience as ora-tor,125to be swayed by the emotion ‘Cicero’ might have generated.The exordiumthat began with ‘Cicero’ in panic ends with him supremelyconfident because of the virtues of his judge.Opening the speech proper (7b–14), ‘Cicero’ announces his inten-tion of criticizing the accusers, to whom he in fact devotes 10 OCTlines. Using as a point of transition their strategy of exploiting Caesar’searlier animosity to give credence to their false charges, he addressesinstead the king’s relations with Rome and Caesar. The judge isagain asked to alleviate ‘Cicero’s’ concerns, purge himself of anger,and recall the concordat he had reached with the king after theirmeeting in Galatia. The orator assumes the true attitude of the judgetowards the defendant (10): ‘And so, though you acquitted him ofthe major charges, you did not forgive a very minor abuse of friend-ship’—not guilt, but a personal querelathat did not prevent a ami-cable outcome. Such manipulation, if not done carefully, might befound offensive even by a judge with fewer pretensions than Caesar.Caesar had rejected Deiotarus’ apology for following Pompey.‘Cicero’ justifies the king’s choice on grounds of loyalty to Rome,but insists that the side each man took in the war was determinednot by personal animus but by an error communis(10), a fatale bellum(13).126More daringly, he argues that Deiotarus’ fidelity to Pompey,however wrong, was tolerable, because Pompey was worthy of it.An emotional commiseratio, like that at Lig. 18, evokes Magnus at his best.No one can read the description of Deiotarus’ going to Pompeyin section 13 unaffected by how unenthusiastically he is portrayedas implementing his decision; equally dispassionate was his with-drawal: ‘So, with the battle of Pharsalus ended, he left Pompey; he125Section 7: ‘who have frequently spoken in behalf of many people.’126The language is reminiscent of Marc. 10 and Lig. 17.258 . MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 258"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"was unwilling to pursue a hope without end. Believing he had satisfiedwhatever liability he may have incurred, or indulged whatever delu-sion he may have entertained, he took himself home.’ No one canread section 14 without feeling the energy and resolve of the manonce he shifted his support to Caesar. ‘Cicero’ produces an unadornedseries of simple sentences, verb-last, of a type sometimes identifiedwith reports made to the Senate by generals in the field.127He stressesthe king’s energy and resolve in his support of Caesar.In the same passage (9), ‘Cicero’ assumes the rôle of a politicaladvisor he had adopted in both earlier speeches. He urges Caesarnot to withdraw the pardon he had once offered to Deiotarus. ‘Noenemy ever appeased you only to find in you traces of resentments.’Although the word clementia appears four times in this speech (8, 38,40, 43), it never means what it did when applied to Marcellus,Ligarius, or other Roman citizens. Deiotarus is a foreign client alreadypardoned for his allegiance to Pompey by Caesar as general in thefield; restoration of civil rights is not an issue. Caesar’s refusal toreturn to the king lands lost to Pharnaces cannot be construed asrepeal of pardon, nor would his conviction on a charge of murder.As a piece of general political advice, on the other hand, it suits the general backdrop of the case relating to foreign policy and tothe persona the orator adopts as political advisor. Cicero returns tothe issue at section 39.‘Cicero’ urges Caesar to treat his hostility to the king as a pri-vate dispute, rather than one engendered by criminality—a distinc-tion made also in Lig.23. There he reduced Tubero’s charges tolittle more than personal pique. Here he treats the animus betweenCaesar and the king as a quarrel between friends terminated by anact of hospitality, offered by the king and accepted by Caesar, whichCicero ornately describes.128The advice to prevent a foreign clientfrom feeling insecure about Rome’s assurance to him is an appealfor stability in a territory through which Roman forces might soonbe marching.Having established Deiotarus as a loyal friend of Rome and Caesar,‘Cicero’ comes to the main charge (15–22), which he treats with a127E. Fraenkel, “Ein Form römischer Kriegsbulletins,” Eranos54 (1956): 189–94 =Kleine Beiträge(Rome 1964) I: 73–92.128Section 8: ‘You were willing to enter his home, you, to renew his old hospi-tality; you did his household gods receive, you did his altar-fires behold as a con-ciliated friend.’’  259MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 259"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"blend of outrage, contempt, and humor. His strategy is to repeatthe accuser’s narrative, punctuating it with comments addressed, usu-ally in his own colloquial style, directly to Caesar, who is consid-ered able to appreciate the tactic. He may in part mock the styleof Phidippus’ report, represented as an example of the vitium of theplain style.129‘Cicero’ begins informally with a vigorous dismissal in exclama-tory adverbs and ellipses: ‘Oh, how unbelievable the charge is! Itdoesn’t even invite suspicion!’ He quotes from the doctor’s narrativethat Deiotarus had tried to lure Caesar, between bathing and retir-ing for the night, to a place where armed assailants might kill him.On this he comments in disbelief tinged with rhetorical outrage: ‘Isthis the charge, is this the indictment for which a runaway accusesa king, a slave his master?’ He is amazed, he tells Caesar, that asuborned doctor was not being used to claim poison as the weaponand muses on the advantages of poison, assuming a rare detachmenton the part of the intended victim.Again, ‘Cicero’ characterizes the accusers’ explanation of Caesar’sescape before stating it (section 19): ‘Oh, how cleverly trumped upthe charge is!’ Nothing occurred. The reason disaster was averted,the doctor claims, is that Caesar decided not to visit the intendedcrime scene. ‘Cicero’ raises with Caesar an innocent question: ‘Whatabout later on? Or did Deiotarus, because the first attempt failedimmediately disband his army?’ In any case Caesar changed his mindafter eating and went to the place; by that time it was too late toattack him.130‘Cicero’ sensibly asks: ‘Would it have been so hard tokeep those assailants where they’d been assigned for another houror two?’At this point ‘Cicero’ departs from burlesque to contrast the actualsituation: a guest, at his ease, enjoying the king’s hospitality and thehost performing with dignity every officiumof his rank. His tone at19 reflects the absence of any sense of agitation or confusion. Heasks the purported victim to recall whether at the time he had noticedin Deiotarus or his men anything ‘that was not orderly and calmand within the manners of a serious and pious man’ (20). Asked toconjecture why his alleged attacker might have wanted him killed129Cf.

Once more the allegedplot is upset by a small change of schedule, to which the assassinslack the mobility to adjust. Now ‘Cicero’ loses patience and asks,‘Had Deiotarus arrayed in the bath bronze statues that could notbe transported into the dining room rather than real assassins?’ Onthat note he dismisses the accusation.‘Cicero’ goes on to discuss (22–34) subsidiary indictments leveledby Castor. The relationship they bear to the main charge is neitherstated nor easy to imagine. They are divided between the claim thatDeiotarus mustered an army to fight Caesar and general allegationsof his hostility to Caesar. The first breaks down into several items,to each of which ‘Cicero’s’ response is flippant. To the charge offorming an army, for example, ’Cicero’s’ retort is not that the kingwouldn’t, but that he couldn’t field an army to challenge Caesar’s,adding gratuitously that once he might have done so, but no longer.To the charge that the cavalry troops he send to support Caesarwere inferior, ‘Cicero’s’ answer is brief, but unctuous: of course theywere not as good as Caesar’s forces, but he had sent the best he had.The recitation of anecdotal evidence that Deiotarus has in vari-ous ways displayed animus towards Caesar throws doubt that theDeiot. was delivered at any kind of a murder trial. If proved, thecharges would not convict; the necessity to refute them gives ‘Cicero’an opportunity to show offhis ingenuity, more extravagantly becauseof the slightness of the burden. For example, at the allegation that,on hearing of the drowning of Caesar’s general, Domitius, the kingquoted a line of Greek poetry: ‘let our friends die, as long as ourenemies die with them,’ ‘Cicero’ asked Caesar (25): ‘But who couldbe Domitius’ friend were he your enemy?’—a rebuttal more at homein the Controversiaeof Seneca.The clearest indication that Cicero is no longer seriously replyingto the res gestaeof a serious trial is the remarkable interlude (26–32)in which ‘Cicero’ interrupts his rebuttal to the secondary chargeswith a bombastic attack on the accusers and a praise of Deiotarusthat is just as obviously rhetorical. The two are interwoven131and131Not unusual; see J. M. May, Trials of Character: The Eloquence of Ciceronian Ethos(Chapel Hill and London: University of North Carolina Press 1988), esp. 28–30.’  261MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 261"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"grow out of the charge that the king danced naked in public uponhearing of the death of Domitius Calvinus. ‘Cicero’s’ rebuttal, anargument from character, is that Deiotarus is too civilized to beguilty of the offense.The king is praised for his frugalitas, a decent restraint that mili-tates against its possessor behaving in public as accused. ‘Cicero’prefers it to regal virtues and attributes it to Deiotarus practicallyfrom birth. By life-long contact with Romans he had acquired thequalities of a Roman gentleman—‘a splendid paterfamiliasand a mostresponsible farmer and cattleman.’ Whether a Roman would with-out irony so judge any foreigner is uncertain; the evidence of Plut.and Strabo (see n. 109, above) is that the king would not have beenthat foreigner.In a graceful period (27), ‘Cicero’ switches focus from the improv-ing youth of his client to his advanced years,—a topic calculated toarouse sympathy while at the same time laying open Castor, theaccuser of his own grandfather, to attack both for the impiety ofmaking the charge of public dancing and for the absurdity of imput-ing such behavior to an older man. He paints an affecting pictureof an old man who had to be lifted on to his horse three years ear-lier at Pharsalus and was universally admired merely for being ableto hold his seat.132Caesar would have only a moment to enjoy thisshameless flimflam before being directed to Castor and the devas-tating image of him on horseback preening himself in anticipationof attacking Caesar, unable to be restrained by other Pompeians,especially Cicero who was by now urging unconditional surrender.133That section of the vituperatioends with a smooth antithesis, ‘Couldyou not enjoy your good fortune, Castor, without utterly ruiningyour relative’s?’ and turns immediately to an impassioned harangueagainst the social impiety of bribing slaves to betray their masters.Some thirty-five OCT lines later, ‘Cicero’ sums up with a total con-demnation of Castor: ‘Did you come to this city precisely to cor-rupt its laws and tradition and stain the humanity of this state withyour own native barbarity?’ Cicero had similarly excluded anotheropponent from the civilized world at Lig. 16.132The same man who met Caesar and kept up with his fast march to Zela,then across half of Cappadocia to the Western border of Galatia and, perhaps,onward to Nicaea.133Section 29.

Itsemphases may also surprise. Neither of the two major arguments ofthe section bears to the apparent charge against Deiotarus.134‘Cicero’first states (35–38) that his goal is to reconcile Caesar with his clientand assure Caesar that Deiotarus bears no grudge. He argues thatthe king is grateful to Caesar for relieving him of much of his king-dom (36), much as Antiochus once thanked Scipio for similarly eas-ing his task as ruler. It is uncertain whether Antiochus expressed abitter, but rhetorically clever irony or a stoic acceptance of a calamity.The middle style that is home to the kind of historical exemplafoundin the Pro Archiaand in the urbane and learned talk of the dialogues,is gentle and controlled, revealing no irony. But Deiotarus neverstopped scheming to be restored to his former domains, even afterCaesar’s death (Phil. 2.94).Perhaps the congeries of rationalizations for accepting loss—Caesarhad other obligations; the honors bestowed by Rome and restoredby Caesar are intact;135a sense of inner worth and memory of hispast services sustain him—reflect the ingenuity of the speaker asmuch as the inner soul of his client. But there is a message: Deiotarus’assigned virtues, magnitudo animi, gravitas, constantia, assure that he willlive a tranquil (and unthreatening) old-age. Magnitudo animiobviateshard feelings; gravitasentails a sense of responsibility and self-respectgenerally denied to non-Romans, while constantiawould be welcometo a Roman general marching through the king’s territory on theway to Parthia.At section 39 ‘Cicero’ shifts his personafrom patronusto advisorand admits that his purpose involves advice on state policy (cf. Lig.29): ‘As I labor in his behalf, I do so also for many prominent menwhose restoration should be permanent, without your gift of it beingcalled into doubt.’ However provoked, Caesar must not by his actiongive any foreign beneficiary of his generosity reason to worry that134In section 42 he argues from the testimony of an attendant of the king thatD. could not have engineered an assassination attempt; but that is limited to justone sentence.135He is buoyed by Caesar’s encouraging letter he received in Tarragon. Havingalso received such a letter (Lig. 7), ‘C.’ is able empathize with his client.’  263MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 263"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"his pardon is subject to repeal. There is no evidence that Ciceroalludes to foreign clients other than Deiotarus; the advice may onlyrelate to Caesar’s nullification of earlier assurances made by Rometo Deiotarus. That does not diminish its validity as advice.The remainder of the peroratioranges over a number of topics,most prominent among them Caesar’s clementia. ‘Cicero’ insists (40),as he did in Lig. 31, that Caesar will not be moved by rhetoric. Andas earlier in this speech he asked Caesar to imagine the pressure toacquit under which a coronaaroused in behalf of Deiotarus wouldhave put him, here he asks Caesar to look at the aggrieved, con-sider their plight, and allow his innate clementiato persuade him.Caesar makes an orator’s work unnecessary. From an ad hocargu-ment that clementiais especially appropriate in the case of kings,‘Cicero’ makes the diplomatic point that they and their heirs will bemore loyal if confident in the retention of their status (41).136Still in the rôle of advisor, Cicero makes his final point: the out-come of this trial will be a victory either for the cruelty of Deiotarus’enemies or the compassion of Caesar. These words and especiallythose at section 41 recall arguments pursued in the two earlierspeeches and here applied to foreign policy: that clementia, beyondreflecting on Caesar’s humanity, can become a diplomatic basis forrestoring the confidence of foreign kings whose relations with Romewere undermined by the political uncertainties of Civil War.137ConclusionSome of the criticism of this speech may stem from the unfamiliarcharacter of the process of which it is a part. The absence of a trueprosecutor and prosecution speech, the nature of the venue whichprohibited the presence of a corona, and the lack of a verdict makethe circumstances of the oration appear sinister. Scholars havedescribed the inquiry as a star-chamber (MacKendrick [1995]: 441),totalitarian justice (Seel [1967]: 349–53), or Kabinetts-justiz (Bring-mann [1986]: 83). Heitland (1923: 3.61) believed the whole inquiry136The king and his son are imagined as present (hi) and in appreciative viewof Caesar.137Cf.

The fact does not reflect judicial inde-cision. Absolute rulers sometimes solicit opinions. In anticipation ofan Eastern campaign Caesar may have wanted to judge the depend-ability of an Eastern potentate whose loyalty to Rome had once beenconsiderable, but who might now have reason to resent Caesar.Caesar might hear a range of charges and allow a patron of thedefendant to argue in his behalf.138 But the procedure would nothave required all the accoutrements of a formal trial.The speech delivered in behalf of Deiotarus by M. Junius Brutusat a hearing held before Caesar at Nicaea, may provide a parallel—no formal prosecution; and only Caesar to sway. Brutus spoke for-mally and with passion. Cicero (Brut. 21) says he spoke ornatissime etcopiosissime; and at Att. 14.1.2 records Caesar’s judgment: ‘he cer-tainly seemed to speak with great energy and freedom’—a tributeto his force and conviction. Well known in its day, his speech sur-vived for at least a century. No one knows precisely the kind ofspeech an advocate might make in such circumstances. It might wellbear some relation to typical defense oratory, accommodated to thealtered milieu. Formal exordiaand perorations treating matters as ifin true trial conditions might be pro formaand/or amuse in the some-what artificial surroundings. If some aspects are redolent of formaldeclamation, the cultivated entertainment that had for decades beenengaging the cognoscenti of Rome might be indulged in the lesspublic ambience of a cognitio. If ‘Cicero’ at times treats with humorthe conventions and tactics of oratory,—e.g. the fiction that theaccusers are formal prosecutors (see above, 254)—he may hope thatthis judge will take extravagant displays of rhetoric in good part. Allspeeches are acts of persuasion; a speech to Caesar would requirethe most exquisite choice of strategies and tactics to avoid insultinghis intelligence by vulgarity; offending his vanity by the obvious; andabove all, boring him. ‘Cicero’ is by turns ironic and direct, emotional138There may have been several hearings; Phil. 2.95: semper enim absenti adfui Deiotaro.’  265MAY_f9_218-271 7/11/02 8:52 PM Page 265"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"and playful, movingly sympathetic and convincingly outraged, keep-ing always a complex blend of respect and intimacy, deference andindependence. These are also qualities by which a man may pro-mote himself as advisor or spokesman.Style (and Content)The Deiot. is often judged a perfunctory oratorical performance, unsat-isfactory even to Cicero himself.139Some believe that the pardon ofMarcellus had raised Cicero’s hopes for a return of the Republicand inspired him to work with Caesar, freely producing pro-Caesarianpropaganda in Lig., only to become disillusioned again and retire tohis study until Caesar co-opted him, against his will, to plead Deiot.In that speech, Caesar wanted the king to be convicted, but waschecked by an unexpectedly! strong speech, though heard by prac-tically no one, from a disengaged defense lawyer.140So disposed,these scholars also find stylistic weakness.141With Caesar away, not much of a political nature was going onin Rome. In early September 45, whatever else Cicero was feeling,he sent Caesar a letter complimenting, of all things, his anti-Cato,and preparing to meet with him.142The last consideration may havebeen paramount in Cicero’s apparent change of mood: Caesar wascoming back. The desire of scholars to deny that Cicero may havebeen willing to participate, to the extent the dictator would permit,in Caesar’s governance predisposes them to be critical of the speecheven as a piece of oratory, as if a brilliant speech would have provenCicero’s devotion to Caesar. They adduce a brief letter written toaccompany a copy of the Deiot.sent to Cornelius Dolabella at hisrequest.143139See Gasti (1997): 49–54.140Loutsch (1974), esp. 410.141See, e.g. Petrone (1978): 101–02.142Att. 13. 50. 1 and 4. At Att. 13. 51 he says: ‘nor did I write otherwise thanto one equal to myself. For I admire those books of his, and therefore wrote himwithout flattery and in a way I think he will read with pleasure.’143Ad Fam. 9. 12, presumably written soon after delivery. J. N.

If he thought as little of it as schol-ars tend to believe, it is surprising that he was willing to broadcastit, especially to his former son-in-law, whose cleverness seems still tohave charmed him.The diminutive oratiuncula(likewise munusculum), tenuem, inopem, levi-dense crasso filohave all been adduced as self-criticism of the stylisticquality and an indication that Cicero, for reasons cited above, couldproduce no better than a messy, uninspired speech.144But diminu-tives need not be taken as pejorative and tenuisand inopsdescribethe case, not the speech.145The next epithet, levidensis crasso filo,146isuniversally considered an admission of weakness in the speech. Thesource of the metaphor is clearly weaving; there is less agreementabout what it means than that its coloring is derogatory. But, read-ing to the end of the conceit, Cicero identifies the quality of his giftwith that of gifts Dolabella typically gives. If this is not meant as aliterary poisoned dart, it seems that Cicero viewed its quality with-out aspersion. The letter accompanying the gift of a speech he judgedrespectable enough to send is, in the tradition of dedicatory cover-letters, suitably self-deprecatory, just as the compliment in its firstsection, that Baiae purified its polluted waters in honor of Dolabella’svisit, is handsomely lavish.A close reading of the speech reveals clever strategies, like themanipulation of the potentially unfavorable dramatic situation in theexordium, and tactics, the parsing of the charge to ridicule the accuser’ssecond-rate narrative style, and the many examples of brilliant,effective composition.

Although they address a vari-ety of political situations, they are unified by a central theme: oppo-sition to Mark Antony’s attempts to seize control of the Republicfollowing the assassination of Julius Caesar. The speeches are thusclosely tied to the complex political events of the period, and aknowledge of this historical background is essential to an apprecia-tion of Cicero’s rhetorical aims. The study by Frisch provides excel-lent guidance in this regard,1and textual matters are also well served,with a number of useful editions and linguistic commentaries on thevarious speeches.2Less work, however, has been done on their rhetor-ical features. Only Wooten attempts an oratorical analysis of the col-lection as a whole, and studies of individual literary aspects arerelatively few in number.3The following discussion presents a briefsummary of the background and content of each speech, and thenexamines four of their most important rhetorical features: (1) Cicero’suse of the ‘rhetoric of crisis’; (2) his use of wit and ridicule, espe-cially in Philippics2 and 13; (3) the rhetorical purpose of praise andhonorific decrees; (4) the style of the speeches.MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 273"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"4The dates are those given by Shackleton Bailey (1986).

He had at his dis-posal an intimidating force of Caesar’s veterans, while Brutus andCassius, the leaders of the assassins, had withdrawn from the cityand were soon to leave the country. Cicero too had up to this pointbeen inclined to avoid confrontation, even going so far as to makearrangements to sail overseas (Att.15.25; 16.6.1–2; 16.7; cf. Phil.1.1–6). Philippic1, however, marks a decisive and fateful change inhis approach to the political situation.Inspired in part by the lone opposition to Antony of CalpurniusPiso Caesoninus (Phil. 1.14), and in part by a sense of duty to Brutus(Att. 16.7), Cicero finally committed himself to taking a stand againstMAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 274"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"the consul. He returned to Rome on 31st August, but declined toattend a meeting of the Senate convened by Antony on the follow-ing day. On September 2nd, however, with Antony himself absentfrom the Senate, Cicero delivered the first Philippic, a forceful andwide ranging attack on Antony’s policies since March 44. Althoughclearly a calculated gesture of political defiance, the speech is notuniformly belligerent, offering in places the possibility of cooperationin the future (see especially Phil. 1.27–34). Antony however wellunderstood the significance of this direct challenge to his leadershipand responded in turn on 19th September with a furious denunci-ation in the Senate of Cicero’s character and career (Fam.12.2.1).In doing so he initiated a decisive breach in their political relations.The second Philippicis a political pamphlet composed as a responseto this tirade. While it takes the dramatic form of a speech deliv-ered directly on 19th September to Antony’s criticisms, Cicero him-self states elsewhere that he was not actually present in the Senatehouse on that day.6The speech is thus an example of written ratherthan spoken political invective. The aim of the pamphlet is twofold:first, to counter Antony’s denigration of his character and reputa-tion; and second, to launch his own attack on Antony’s politicalcredibility.The speech is probably the best known of the Philippicsto themodern audience, due in part perhaps to the appeal of its colorful,strident language, and in part to the availability of English andGerman commentaries suited to the school and university student.All the more reason then to stress that the speech is in fact some-thing of an anomaly within the collection as a whole. Its functionas invective means that it contains little of the deliberative style oforatory found elsewhere in the Philippics; and with a total of 119 sec-tions it is more than twice as long as any of the other speeches. Aswe shall see below, the speech contains many passages of vitupera-tive brilliance; but its form and content overall are quite unlike thoseof the other Philippics.6Phil. 5.19–20. While a written text of the speech was certainly being preparedin late October 44 (Att.15.13.1–2; 15.13a.3; 16.11.1–2), the precise date of its cir-culation is not known. Early December seems plausible, given Antony’s departurefor Cisalpine Gaul at the end of November. For a convenient summary of the rel-evant evidence, see S. Cerutti, “Further Discussion on the Delivery and Publicationof Cicero’s Second Philippic,” Classical Bulletin 70 (1994): 23–28, although his attemptto overturn the standard view that the speech was never delivered should be treatedwith caution. PHILIPPICS275MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 275"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"(2) Philippics3, 4, 5 and 6By November 44 Octavian, with the help of his own army of Caesar’sveterans, had forced his way onto the political scene. Antony, awarethat his military superiority was no longer secure, hurriedly left Romeon 29th November to take over the province of Cisalpine Gaul fromD. Brutus. Brutus resisted and was eventually besieged by Antonyat Mutina. Cicero’s prime concern with Antony now out of Romeand the new consuls for 43 (C. Vibius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius)about to enter office, was to raise effective military and politicalopposition to the Antonian cause. Philippic3, delivered towards theend of December, thus urges the Senate to give its official approvalto the actions of Octavian and D. Brutus in resisting Antony. AlthoughCicero certainly had private reservations about Octavian’s trustwor-thiness, he realized that the young man provided an important coun-terweight to Antony’s military dominance in Italy (Att.16.9; Att.16.14.1), and so lavishes extravagant praise on the young man. Thespeech, like many of the others that follow, also contains fierce de-nunciations of Antony and his policies. Philippic4 was delivered ata contioimmediately after this senatorial debate and presents a brief,partisan account of the proceedings there and Cicero’s contributionto it.Cicero pursues much the same tactics in Philippic 5, vilifying Antonyand proclaiming enthusiastic support for Octavian, D. Brutus and,on this occasion, M. Lepidus. His main challenge in the speech isto counter a concerted effort by Antony’s supporters to push theSenate into peace negotiations. The debate continued for severaldays and established Cicero as the prime advocate of forceful mili-tary action against Antony, a role that he plays in most of the fol-lowing Philippics. His proposals proved in this instance only partiallysuccessful; Octavian, Brutus and Lepidus all received recognitionfrom the Senate, but plans were also made to send an embassy toAntony.Philippic6, like Philippic4, was delivered at a contioand likewisesummarizes Cicero’s arguments in the recent senatorial debate. Thesetwo speeches are the only contionesin the Philippicsand both areremarkable for their brevity (16 and 19 sections long respectively).Only De Lege Agraria3, a speech quite different in design and pur-pose, is of comparable length among Cicero’s extant public speeches.In Catilinam2 and 3, and Post Reditum apud Populumare nearly twice276 MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 276"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"as long, Pro Lege Manilialonger still. In this respect Philippics4 and6 may provide examples of the kind of brief ad hocoratory that aRoman senator delivered quite frequently in the course of his polit-ical business but usually did not make the effort to publish. Ciceropresumably circulated copies in this case because he wanted to cre-ate the impression that the common people strongly supported hiscause. Philippic4.6–7 and 6.12–13 in particular depict the crowdresponding positively to his arguments against Antony.(3) Philippics 7, 8 and 9Philippics7, 8 and 9 all address issues arising from the Senate’s deci-sion to send an embassy to negotiate with Antony at Mutina. InPhilippic7 Cicero complains that a misplaced hope in the embassyis blunting the Senate’s preparations for armed resistance againstAntony. Again the stance that he adopts is hardheaded and uncom-promising, taking individual senators to task and insisting on intro-ducing the Antonian question into a debate on quite different matters.The same tough-talking attitude appears in Philippic8, a speech onthe counterproposals that Antony has sent back with the ambas-sadors. Cicero castigates those in the Senate supporting Antony’scause, characterizes his proposals as insulting and unreasonable, andfiercely criticizes the Senate for its irresolute response to them. Heconcludes with his own (apparently successful) proposal that anyonejoining Antony’s forces should be regarded as acting contra rem publicam.Servius Sulpicius Rufus, one of the three ambassadors sent toAntony, died in the course of this mission. Philippic9 is Cicero’s con-tribution to a debate in the Senate regarding the public honors tobe bestowed upon him. The discussion was to a large extent a mat-ter of routine senatorial business, and Cicero’s speech is in part arespectful eulogy of Sulpicius. Typically, however, he also exploitsthe occasion for a further attack on Antony’s cause. By presentingSulpicius as heroically fallen in the service of the state, Cicero canslyly depict Antony as a dangerous enemy of the republic (see belowfor further discussion).(4) Philippics10 and 11The focus of senatorial debate shifts in Philippics10 and 11 to theeastern provinces.

These included theallotment of Macedonia to his brother Gaius. A later motion of theSenate, however, advised existing provincial governors to disregardall such assignments, with the result that Q. Hortensius Hortalus,the outgoing governor of Macedonia, placed his legions at the dis-posal of Marcus Brutus, who was now raising an army in Greece.The scene was thus set for further conflict between Caesar’s assas-sins and the supporters of Antony.In the ensuing senatorial debate the consul Pansa seems to haveproposed that Brutus’ control over the three provinces of Greece,Macedonia and Illyricum be given official recognition, while Q. FufiusCalenus argued for the legitimacy of Gaius’ command. In Philippic10 Cicero presents his own position, devoting part of the speech toan attack on Antony’s brother and part to praise of Brutus. Perhapsthe speech’s most interesting challenge, however, is its attempt toconvince the Senate that Caesar’s veterans will accept Brutus, oneof his assassins, as commander (Phil. 10.15–20); Cicero’s skillful rhetoricseems to have carried the day (Phil. 11.26).Philippic11 is also concerned with the allocation of imperiumin theeast, although its origins are quite different. Towards the end ofFebruary news arrived in Rome that C. Trebonius, governor of Asiaand one of Caesar’s assassins, had been brutally put to death by P. Dolabella, who was on his way to Syria with a legion. Dolabellahad recently aligned himself with Antony and was now in a posi-tion to take control of Asia. The Senate’s response to this shockingturn of events was unanimous, at least in one respect: Dolabella wasdenounced and declared a public enemy. Who should be givenauthority to confront his army was more controversial, however. InPhilippic11 Cicero argues that command should be granted to C. Cassius Longinus, a general already in the vicinity and wellqualified for the task. It was a sensible proposal, but one that under-standably proved unpopular with both Caesarians and Antonians inthe Senate. Pansa in particular was hostile to the idea and succeededin pushing through an alternative proposal, which assigned Syria andAsia to himself and Hirtius.(5) Philippics12, 13 and 14Dolabella’s move into Asia and the weakening position of D.

Plans for themission soon ran into trouble, however, as Cicero and P. ServiliusIsauricus (another of the proposed participants) began to suspect thatthey had been deceived by accounts of Antony’s desire for com-promise. Consequently Cicero asserts in Philippic12 that he was mis-taken in agreeing to participate in the embassy, and argues forcefullyagainst both its validity in principle and his own personal involve-ment with it. In the end the embassy was never sent, although it isnot clear whether it was derailed primarily by Cicero’s speech orsimply overtaken by other developments. Whatever the case, allthoughts of negotiation soon evaporated; a couple of weeks laterPansa left Rome with four legions to strengthen the armed opposi-tion to Antony.Soon after his departure the Senate received letters from L. MunatiusPlancus and M. Lepidus (governors of Transalpine Gaul and NarboneseGaul/Nearer Spain respectively) advising a course of compromisewith Antony. (These letters were presumably written when the notionof a second embassy was still current.) Cicero himself had furtherreceived a copy of a letter sent by Antony to Hirtius and Octavian,which urged the generals to join forces with Antony and pursue acampaign of vengeance against Caesar’s assassins. No less alarm-ingly, this letter also suggested that Lepidus and Plancus supportedAntony’s cause. In Philippic13 Cicero sets out to counter this dis-turbing turn of events. In the first part he argues vehemently againstLepidus’ view that peace with Antony is possible (he makes no men-tion of Plancus’ letter in the published version of the speech). In thesecond part he reads to the Senate the contents of Antony’s letterand subjects it to extended ridicule, hoping to reveal Antony’s treach-ery and forestall any swell of support for the cause of punishing theassassins. This second part in particular is a tour de force of Cicero’sscathing oratorical wit (see further below).On April 15th Pansa’s legions clashed outside Mutina with those ledby Antony. The first reports to arrive in Rome told of an Antonianvictory, prompting great dismay within the Senate and leading torumors (manufactured by Antonian agitators) that Cicero intendedto seize power in the city. Finally, however, the fact of Antony’sdefeat became known, and an official account of the engagementwas read out at a meeting of the Senate on 21st April.

He begins by taking issue with some ofthe proposals made by the first speaker, P. Servilius Isauricus, remind-ing the Senate that, despite Antony’s defeat, Decimus Brutus is stillbesieged. He then goes on to praise those fallen in battle and pro-poses honors for them and their generals. It is at this moment ofapparent political success that our record of Cicero’s oratory comesto an end. As events would go on to prove, however, Antony andhis army were by no means finished. Cicero’s stubborn oppositionwould eventually fail.As this summary shows, the Philippicsprovide us with a wide rangeof oratorical situations: speeches on provincial commands and funeralhonors; a eulogy of those killed in battle; brief orations to a publicassembly; harangues against Antony in the Senate and the writteninvective of Philippic2. They thus offer important glimpses into thekind of deliberative oratory usually employed in the Senate. Philippic9, for example, on the honors to be paid to Sulpicius Rufus, seemscloser to a sententia(a brief statement of opinion on matters underdebate) than to a fully elaborated oratio. The distinction is not alwaysan easy one to make,7but in this case the speech derives its mainargument from the proposals made by previous speakers, and itsbrevity (a succinct 17 sections) points to the speech’s relatively mod-est role within the wider debate. Philippic11 is considerably longer(40 sections), but is likewise organised around the views alreadyexpressed in the current debate, and concludes with a cogently arguedcounter-proposal.Other speeches are likewise limited in scope, often eschewingextended digressions and keeping the argument sharply focused onthe formal proposals that they present.8(Eight of the eleven sena-torial speeches—Philippics3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14—formulate specificproposals for decrees.) This context of senatorial debate also allowsCicero to dispense with lengthy introductions and engage swiftly with7See J. W. Crawford, M. Tullius Cicero: The Lost and Unpublished Orations(Göttingen:Vandenhoeck & Reprecht 1984): 16–19.8Philippic7 provides an interesting contrast. In this case Cicero abruptly divergesfrom the rather mundane matters under debate—the Appian Way, the Mint, theLuperci—to address what he considers to be the more important and pressing issue:the Senate’s lack of vigor in organizing military opposition against Antony (Phil.7.1). This speech too, however, is kept relatively brief (27 sections).280 MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 280"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"the issues at hand (see especially Philippics8, 11, 12, 13). In thisrespect his approach is rather different from that of his forensic ora-tions. Such direct, businesslike oratory is certainly not unknown inthe other extant senatorial speeches. De Provinciis Consularibus, De LegeAgraria1 and In Catilinam4 provide perhaps the closest parallels. Butnone of these attempts to formulate a decree to be put to a vote,and the other senatorial speeches that survive (In Catilinam1, PostReditum ad Senatum, De Haruspicum Responsoand Pro Marcello) do notrepresent the kind of deliberations that regularly took place in thehouse. The Philippicsthus constitute some of our best evidence forthe nature of senatorial oratory and debate.It should be noted, however, that the fourteen preserved speechesare not a complete record of Cicero’s oratorical activity during thesemonths. Several other speeches were delivered that were either notcirculated or have since been lost.9Cicero did not publish, for exam-ple, a copy of the speech that he delivered at a contioin February43 following Philippic11, his speech in the Senate in support ofCassius (Fam. 12.7.1–2). His decision to circulate the senatorial speechbut not the public one suggests that on this particular issue heregarded the business conducted in the Senate as the more impor-tant and influential.10At the same time, the fact that he did notpublish a speech that was supposedly well received by the assemblyraises the suspicion that the audience was not in fact quite so wel-coming as Cicero would like Cassius to believe (Fam. 12.7.1). Consid-erable hostility towards Caesar’s assassins still prevailed at Rome,and Cicero’s limited use of contionesduring these months may havebeen influenced in part by the unpredictable reactions that he waslikely to encounter.As our summary has indicated, Cicero encountered considerableopposition from his senatorial audience too. Q. Fufius Calenus (cos.47) was Antony’s most active supporter in the Senate and had beengranted the influential privilege of speaking first in debates.11Others9See Crawford (1984): 250–53; 259.

It is clear that the fourteen speeches that we dopossess were circulated soon after their delivery (ad Brut. 2.3.4; 2.4.2).11Calenus was father-in-law of the new consul, Pansa, a fact that presumablyinfluenced the decision. See Frisch (1946): 169–71 for other consulars who also PHILIPPICS281MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 281"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"pursued a more moderate course of appeasement with Antony. Themotives of such men no doubt varied. Some, especially in the monthsbefore Antony left Rome for Gaul, would have been intimidated intoa stance of complacency (see, for example, Fam.12.2.1 on Antony’smenacing tactics). Others, such as Hirtius and Pansa, may have hadrather more noble reasons for attempting compromise. Any civil warwas bound to be brutal, and the Senate was frequently short offinancial and military resources.12At the same time, their close asso-ciation with Caesar was not likely to dispose them too kindly to hisassassins.Cicero then could not always rely on his views receiving a friendlyreception. The kind of opposition that he could face is best illus-trated perhaps by Philippic12, where Cicero argues against his inclu-sion in the proposed second embassy to Antony. It is a forceful andcarefully reasoned speech, but several features suggest that he encoun-tered considerable resistance in the course of its delivery. It is strik-ing, for example, that he changes his line of argument quite radicallyabout half way through. He begins by asserting that the embassy ismisconceived in principle, and draws upon a battery of rhetoricaldevices to press home the point, including exclamations, urgent rhetor-ical questions and appeals to shame (Phil.12.7–8). At Philippic12.16,however, he changes tack. He no longer argues against the embassyas a whole, merely his own participation in it (12.16–30). This smacksof a tactical retreat, as if he has recognized that his arguments againstthe embassy itself are not succeeding, and that the best that he canhope for now is his own exclusion from it.There are more explicit signs of direct opposition too. The factthat Cicero addresses Pansa directly five times between sections 15to 23 suggests that he is being actively challenged by the consul asthe speech progresses. Indeed we know that the Senate had objectedquite forcefully on a similar occasion in January 43, when ServiusSulpicius Rufus tried to withdraw from the first peace delegation toAntony on the grounds of ill health (Phil.9.8: vehementius excusationiobstitistis).

And Cicero’spromise at the very end of Philippic12 to take further thought onthe whole matter is not the triumphant conclusion of one whosespeech has clearly carried the day.13The Philippicsthen take place in a context of tense, often heatedsenatorial debate. The mood of Cicero’s audience naturally changedaccording to the political circumstances of the time, but rarely couldhe expect his proposals to meet with unanimous agreement. As weshall see, he is often forced to adopt a combative, hectoring man-ner as he attempts to counter the dangerous activity of Antony’ssupporters, and the insidious complacency of many of the other sen-ators. Two strategies are particularly important in helping him toachieve these aims.The rhetoric of crisisThe main way in which Cicero tries to raise strong and decisiveopposition against Antony is through the ‘rhetoric of crisis.’14Bydepicting Rome and the Republic as on the brink of destruction,Cicero attempts to jolt the Senate into urgent, energetic action.Frequently, for example, he presents the situation as a stark choicebetween freedom and slavery (Phil. 3.29):Therefore since the question now is whether he pays his penalty tothe Commonwealth or we become slaves, in the Gods’ name, Membersof the Senate, let us at last take our fathers’ heart and courage, resolv-ing to regain the freedom that belongs to the Roman race and name,or else to prefer death to slavery.15The present moment, Cicero claims, is crucial and requires decisiveaction (Phil.3.32):13Shackleton Bailey (1986): 299 notes the oddity of these final remarks, but offersa rather different interpretation.14See Wooten (1983), esp. 58.15quapropter, quoniam res in id discrimen adducta est utrum ille [sc.

If we miss the momentthere will not come another.16An important feature here is what has been aptly termed the ‘dis-junctive mode.’17Cicero describes the situation in terms that excludethe possibility of any middle course or compromise (Phil. 5.6):Let me make plain what is at issue; it will be easy then for you gen-tlemen to decide what to propose or support. The issue is whetherMarcus Antonius should be given the means of crushing the com-monwealth, massacring honest men, plundering Rome, bestowing landon his brigands, enslaving the Roman people; or whether none of thisbe placed within his power.18These alarmist claims continue throughout the speeches: Antony’ssupporters have already marked out for themselves the properties tobe confiscated when they win (Phil. 8.9; 4.9; 14.10). They are vio-lent and unpredictable, worse even than the revolutionary renegadesof Rome’s past: L. Antonius poses a greater threat than the Gracchi(Phil.7.17); Dolabella is more savage than L. Cinna (Phil.11.1);Antony is himself more tyrannical than Tarquinius Superbus (Phil.3.9–11), crueler than Hannibal (Phil.14.9).19Cicero also uses rhetorical enargeiato heighten this sense of alarmand indignation.20In Philippic11, for example, he describes Dolabella’sexecution of C. Trebonius in Syria (Phil.11.7):So picture the scene...armed men bursting into Trebonius’ house,while he, poor wretch, saw the swords of the brigands before he heardwhat was going on; the entry of the raging Dolabella, his foul voice,16non tempore oblato, ducibus paratis, animis militum incitatis, populo Romano conspirante,Italia tota ad libertatem recuperandam excitata, deorum immortalium beneficio utemini? nullum erittempus hoc amisso.17Wooten (1983): 58–86.18quid autem agatur cum aperuero, facile erit statuere quam sententiam dicatis aut quamsequamini. agitur utrum M.

The more vivid the portrayal, the greaterits impact. This type of enargeiais used with equally striking effectin Philippic13, this time to arouse a feeling of dismay and indigna-tion rather than horror (Phil.13.4):Picture to yourselves their faces, above all those of the Antonii, theirgait, appearance, expression, air of consequence; and their friends,some walking by their side, others in front. Imagine the reek of wine,the abusive, threatening language.22Again it is the precision and fulsomeness of the detail that bring thedepiction startlingly to life, as too the appeal to senses other thanthe visual: the unpleasant smell conveyed by vini anhelitum, the men-acing sounds suggested by contumelias and minas verborum. In othercases, however, a single detail is all that is required for memorable,shocking effect (Phil.3.4):Under his host’s roof at Brundisium he [sc. Antony] ordered bravesoldiers and loyal citizens to be murdered; it was commonly reportedthat as they lay dying at his feet their blood splashed into his wife’sface.23What Antony would call the justifiable execution of traitors becomesin Cicero’s hands a sadistic slaughter of innocents.24The rhetoric ofcrisis thus relies to a large extent on a strident language of extremesand exaggeration; of comparisons and depictions designed to disturbthe audience. Not surprisingly Cicero’s opponents disparaged suchtactics and depicted him as an irresponsible war-monger (Phil.7.3:21ponite igitur ante oculos...irruptionem armatorum in Treboni domum, cum miser ille priuslatronum gladios videret quam quae res esset audisset; furentis introitum Dolabellae, vocem impu-ram atque os illud infame, vincla, verbera, eculeum, tortorem carnificemque Samiarium.22ora vobis eorum ponite ante oculos et maxime Antoniorum, incessum, aspectum, vultum, spiri-tum, latera tegentis alios, alios praegredientis amicos, quem vini anhelitum, quas contumelias forecensetis minasque verborum!23quippe qui in hospitis tectis Brundisi fortissimos viros optimosque civis iugulari iusserit; quo-rum ante pedes eius morientium sanguine os uxoris respersum esse constabat.24Antony’s capacity for bloodshed is further developed at Phil.4.4; 4.14; 5.20. PHILIPPICS285MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 285"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"bellicum me cecinisse dicunt). The taunt was not without basis. Whenthe first envoy to Antony was proposed in January 43, Cicero rejectedthe idea, arguing instead for outright war (Phil.5.33):With this man, Members of the Senate, we must fight it out. It mustbe war, I repeat, war, and that right away. No drawn-out business ofenvoys!25And when, a month later, L. Caesar called for a state of tumult(Phil.8.1–2), Cicero again tried, using legalistic, disjunctive language,to push the Senate to a more extreme position (Phil.8.2–4):Certain persons thought that the name of war ought not to be in themotion. They preferred to call it ‘tumult’.... (4) There is no halfwayhouse between war and peace. If ‘tumult’ does not come under theheading of war, it must come under the heading of peace—than whichnothing more incongruous can well be said or thought.26Likewise Cicero strives on numerous occasions to brand Antony anenemy of the state (hostis). There is, he claims, no third possibility:either Antony is a commander employing his troops legitimately, orhe is an enemy against whom the Senate must declare war. Heargues the point in December 44 (Phil.3.14 and 21; 4.1–5), pursuesit again in January 43 (Phil.5.21; 7.10–13), once more in February(Phil.8.6), and for a final time in April following the battle of Mutina(Phil.14.6–10 and 22). His repeated failure to carry the point illus-trates well the degree of opposition that he encountered in the Senateand the difficulty of the rhetorical challenge that faced him.To a degree this rhetoric of crisis simply reworks devices thatCicero had employed with success earlier in his career. As early as70 B.C. he had depicted the case against Verres as much more thanthe trial of an individual; the jury’s decision (he claims) is alsoabsolutely vital for deciding the extent of the Senate’s judicial powerin the years to come (Ver.1.1–3; 46–49; 2.5.177–78). In 63 B.C. heportrays Catiline as a monster plotting the death of senators andabout to overwhelm the earth with fire and slaughter (Catil. 1.2–3);his troops are already assigned to various regions of Italy, and plans25cum hoc, patres conscripti, bello, <bello> inquam, decertandum est, idque confestim; lega-torum tarditas repudianda est.26belli nomen ponendum quidam in sententia non putabant: tumultum appellare malebant....(4) cum inter bellum et pacem medium nihil sit, necesse est tumultum, si belli non sit, pacis esse:quo quid absurdius dici aut existimari potest?286 MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 286"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"for murder and arson in Rome are afoot (Catil.2.6). On the writtenpage such strategies can seem to the modern reader crudely exag-gerated and manipulative. But this approach seems in fact to be inline with the general tenor of Roman political rhetoric. P. ClodiusPulcher employed similar tactics against Cicero in the 50’s B.C.,depicting him as a cruel despot aiming at tyranny. The pater patriaeof 63 becomes in Clodius’ invective a hostis Capitolinus, a rex, a crudelistyrannus.27Likewise Antony, himself often labeled by Cicero a low-life gladiator, responds in kind by calling his opponent a lanistaortrainer of gladiators (Phil. 13.40)—a potent jibe, with its implicationthat Cicero is profiteering from the organization of a rag-tag mili-tary force (as opposed to one made up of respectable Roman legion-aries). Certainly some of this rhetoric is conventional; but this doesnot mean that it is ineffective. The fact that Cicero and Antonyspend time rebutting such attacks points to their power to shapepublic perceptions.Moreover, as we have seen, the situation was not one that calledfor nuanced argument. Civil war was a drastic step to take, andCicero’s demonization of Antony was crucial to his persuasive strategy.The reticent and recalcitrant Senate was unlikely to respond to any-thing less. And since, from Cicero’s point of view, Antony was thelatest in a succession of public menaces that included Catiline in the60s and Clodius in the 50s, it is not surprising to find him callingonce again upon the rhetorical techniques that had proved success-ful on these earlier occasions.28The main difference lies in the vigorand intensity with which he pursues this rhetoric of crisis through-out the Philippicsas a whole. It operates in these speeches on a muchgrander scale than anywhere else. To some extent Cicero was per-haps forced to elaborate it to this degree by the development ofpolitical events, which required him to repeat and rework his warn-ings of catastrophe over several months; nevertheless, it is a chal-lenge to which he responds with impressive energy and imagination.27W.

On other occasions,however, Cicero sets out to undermine Antony’s moral and politi-cal authority through mockery. The most famous examples appearin the invective of Philippic2, where the principal aim is to charac-terize Antony not as dangerous but as ridiculous; as a man of unpar-alleled levitas, quite unworthy of respect or admiration.29As we haveseen, this speech is quite unlike any of the others in the collection,not least because it does not set out to address matters of currentsenatorial policy. It is not so much a political speech as part of theverbal sparring expected in aristocratic feuds in the Late Republic.In generic terms it has much in common with the In Pisonemof55 B.C., with both speeches setting out to damage their opponent’spersonal prestige through invective.30The approach in Philippic2,however, differs in one important respect. In the In Pisonem, Cicerotends to rely on repeated insult, employing a wide range of abusiveterms in an apparently arbitrary and indiscriminate way (e.g. Pis.11: carnifex; 13: caenum; 14: furcifer; 31: immanissimum ac foedissimum mon-strum). Philippic2 by contrast achieves much of its effect throughcomic caricature. Cicero seizes upon several dubious features ofAntony’s character, and constructs from them a memorably ridicu-lous portrait of him as a foolish and intemperate buffoon.Antony’s notorious drinking habits provide rich material for sucha caricature. Through judicious hyperbole Cicero turns a drunkenindiscretion into a scene of striking repugnance (Phil.2.63):But in an assembly of the Roman people, a master of horse, con-ducting public business! Where a belch would have been a disgrace,he vomited, filling his lap and his whole platform with morsels of foodstinking of wine!3129See L. A. Sussman, “Antony as a Miles Gloriosusin Cicero’s Second Philippic,”Scholia 3 (1994): 53–83, for a good discussion of the individual features of Cicero’sdepiction of Antony, although the associations that he draws with the comic milesgloriosuscharacter are at times strained.

ElsewhereCicero evokes the smell of stale wine on Antony’s breath (Phil.2.30and 2.42), slyly suggests that his inconsistent pronouncements asaugur were a result of the drink (Phil.2.81; 84), and that his attemptsto found a colony at Capua were affected by a furiosam vinolentiam(Phil.2.101). This accumulation of detail gives the depiction a per-suasive consistency and depth.Antony’s love affair with the mimaCytheris offered further scopefor ridicule. Cicero portrays Antony attending the birthday partiesof professional clowns (Phil.2.15), travelling in the company of actorsand pimps (Phil.2.58), and encouraging their gambling and gluttony(Phil.2.62). Perhaps most inventive and lively is his depiction ofAntony disguised as a humble courier attempting to deliver a letterto his estranged wife (Phil.2.77). The actions unfolds in the ludicrousmanner of a comic mime, with Antony drinking heavily in a tav-ern, tricking his way into a meeting with his wife, then finally reveal-ing his true identity and taking her rapturously in his arms (Phil.2.77). Cicero deftly strips the consul of 44 of all poise and dignity.32He also depicts Antony as remarkably stupid, although in this casehe relies more on straightforward sneers than caricature. Most ofthese taunts occur in the speech’s opening refutation of Antony’saccusations. To the claim, for example, that Cicero made unconsti-tutional use of force during the Catilinarian conspiracy, Cicero ripostes(Phil.2.19):It is not audacity that makes you say these shameless things, but yourfailure to perceive glaring consistencies.

The effectis not simply to prove Antony’s criticisms wrong. Cicero is able toassert his own intellectual superiority (and thus his better credentialsfor leading the state), while Antony is characterized as a dimwitwhose slanders are easily parried. As the speech progresses, Antonyappears not just as a drunken clown, but as an astoundingly moronicone as well.This use of comic caricature and ridicule are again not featuresunique to the Philippics. They call to mind most obviously Cicero’sapproach in the Pro Caelio, where the aristocratic Clodia is portrayedas a common meretrix, and the serious accusations of procuring poi-son are shrugged offby being presented as a scene from farce (Cael.49–50; 63–67).34In both speeches the aim is comic trivialization,and in both Cicero succeeds admirably. But it is worth noting thathe does not employ the technique to any great extent in the Philippicsbeyond this written invective. Such ridicule serves well to exposeAntony’s unsuitability to govern Rome; but when the consul leaveswith his army to challenge Decimus Brutus, Cicero’s aims change.There is still room for jeers at Antony’s tippling and debauchery,but the need to depict him as a dangerous and violent figure becomesmore urgent. Sneers give way to darker, more disturbing portraits,as the wrangling of personal inimicitiais replaced by a larger con-cern for the impending national crisis.35Nevertheless, another occasion arose in March 43 that requiredfrom Cicero a similar kind of forceful attack on Antony’s personalnon vide[a]s. nihil profecto sapis. quid est enim dementius quam, cum rei publicae perniciosa armaipse ceperis, obicere alteri salutaria?34Cf.

As we have seen, in Philippic13 Cicero revealsto the Senate a letter that Antony has sent to Hirtius and Octavian,two of the commanders leading armies against him. In it Antonyapparently denounced Cicero and the Republican cause, justified hisown policies, and attempted to persuade Hirtius and Octavian tojoin forces with him (see especially Phil.13.38; 40; 42).36This wasclearly a dangerous and potentially subversive document. As Cicerorecognised, to lose the support of Hirtius and Octavian would bedisastrous for the senatorial cause, and the letter’s claims had to bediscredited thoroughly and decisively. In this case, however, Ciceroemploys not ludicrous caricature, but an incisive form of wit knownas dicacitasto achieve his end. As he observes in De Oratore, whenhandled well this type of humor—which consists of sharp, wittyresponses to remarks made by one’s adversary—overthrows the oppo-nent’s arguments, wins the admiration of the audience through itscleverness, and shows the speaker to be a man of poise and refinement(De Orat.2.236).37Philippic13 stands out as one of the finest exam-ples of Cicero’s use of dicacitas, and hence also of his oratorical humorin general.His approach is to read out extracts from Antony’s letter and holdeach up in turn to derision and ridicule. A few examples will illus-trate the virtuoso nature of this display. At 13.23 Cicero neatly coun-ters Antony’s insults of the murdered Trebonius with a sharp jab atthe status of Antony’s own children (Phil. 13.23): at [ Trebonium] scurraefilium appellat...is autem humilitatem despicere audet cuiusquam qui ex Fadiasustulerit liberos? (‘Then he calls Trebonius “the son of a buffoon”....Does the father of Fadia’s children dare to despise anybody’s lowlysocial origins?’)38This is followed by a derisive double entendre ashe depicts Antony’s debauched lifestyle (Phil. 13.24):...in lustris, popi-nis, alea, vino tempus aetatis omne consumpsisses, ut faciebas, cum in gremiismimarum mentum mentemque deponeres. (‘You would have spent your entirelife in brothels, cookshops, gaming, drinking, as you used to do whenyou laid your mind and mouth in the lap of actresses’).39And then36Frisch (1946): 252–55 conveniently reconstructs the letter’s content.37See also de Orat.2.218–22; Orat.87; A.

(27) Decius too is there, a scion,I believe, of the Mures Decii, which accounts for his gnawing upCaesar’s gifts.40In just a few lines, Cicero manages to incorporate an amusinglydemeaning image (corycus laterum et vocis), a cleverly alliterative insult(diruptus dirutusque), pointed antithesis (fidei patronus, fraudator creditorum),and scathing sarcasm (the description of Cotyla Varius as columenamicorum Antoni). Even the contrived pun on Muribus(from mus,‘mouse’) and erosit(‘nibbled, gnawed’) packs a punch with its criti-cism of Decius’ prodigality.41Cicero’s rebuttal is relentless and comprehensive, extending tosome 28 sections, and it is this exhaustiveness that makes it unique.In approach and technique these witty retorts are certainly similarto those employed by politicians in the context of oratorical alterca-tio. Indeed Cicero had long been renowned for his skill at this kindof verbal sparring, and many of the examples of dicacitasthat he pre-sents in the De Oratore(e.g. 2.240–288) derive from such a context.42But in Philippic13 he undertakes something of a quite different mag-nitude. His use of a written text to provide the prompts for his sar-castic rejoinders is also unusual, although not entirely unknown.Cicero refers (De Orat. 2.223–24) to the famous orator L. Crassus(cos. 95) generating humor from the text of a dialogue on civil law(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press 1996): 122–23, with n. 33, on the sex-ual allusion. mentumliterally = ‘chin.’40aedilicii, corycus laterum et vocis meae, Bestia, et fidei patronus, fraudator creditorum,Trebellius, et homo diruptus dirutusque Caelius, columenque amicorum Antoni, Cotyla Varius,quem Antonius deliciarum causa loris in convivio caedi iubebat a servis publicis....

And Antony himself had ridiculedone of Cicero’s letters in the meeting of the Senate on 19th September44 (Phil. 2.7). Cicero’s refutation in Philippic13, however, is far moreambitious and impressive.43While Philippics2 and 13 represent the two most extended exam-ples of humorous ridicule, passages of a similarly aggressive tenorcan be found in the other speeches as well (e.g. Phil.11.10–14). Thisfact highlights two important features of the Philippicsoverall. Thefirst is the extensive part played by attacks on character. In generalthe speeches rarely stray too far from matters of immediate politi-cal policy; but when they do, it is usually to embark on some kindof personal vilification. Cicero thus manages to link political issueswith the moral credentials of those involved. As we have seen, bothcaricature and hyperbolic depictions of his violent character serve toundercut Antony’s ethical standing within the Philippics. Conversely,just as Cicero had presented himself as savior of the state in theyears following Catiline’s conspiracy, so he strives to style himself inthe Philippicsas defensor conservatorque libertatis(Phil.3.28: ‘defender andprotector of freedom’). As often in Cicero’s oratory, the projectionof his own personal authority, and the dismantling of his opponent’s,work closely with the presentation of actual facts and argument.44The second distinctive feature of the humor in Philippics2 and 13is its acerbic and forthright tone. Cicero employs this confrontationalmanner throughout the speeches as a whole, often in conjunctionwith caustic sarcasm.45In Philippics8, for example, Cicero ridiculesCalenus’ support of Antony (Phil.8.18):And what is more, to make himself appear a more conscientious sen-ator, he says he has no call to be Antony’s friend, seeing that Antony43Cf.

Beholdthe power of patriotism! He has a personal grievance, but for the com-monwealth’s sake he defends—Antony!46This is just one part of a strident and vociferous harangue (Phil.8.16):I do admit, Quintus Fufius, that in one case your perception was bet-ter than mine. I used to think Publius Clodius a pernicious citizen,criminal, lustful, unpatriotic, insolent, villainous. You on the contraryregarded him as blameless, moderate, innocent, and unassuming, avaluable and desirable member of the community. In this one instanceI acknowledge your keen perspicacity and my own grave error.47The conceit is a little labored perhaps; but the description of Clodiusas sanctusand temperanshas a sharp edge to it and helps as well toassociate Antony with Clodius’ disruptive political violence. MoreoverCicero’s dryly mocking admission of Calenus’ perspicacity gives lit-tle room for effective retort. This kind of caustic sarcasm recursthroughout the Philippics, directed most often against Antony himself(e.g. Phil. 2.30–32; 3.16; 5.13–15), but also on occasions against hissupporters in the Senate (e.g. Phil. 7.2–3). Like the comic caricaturethat we have discussed, its effect is usually to expose the falsehoodof Antony’s claims to respectability; in doing so it also succeeds incontributing to Cicero’s own pose of superior insight and moralauthority.The rhetorical purpose of praise and honorific decreesAs we have seen, Cicero’s main aim in the Philippicsis to persuadethe Senate to take decisive action against Antony. A second impor-tant aim, however, is to organize a viable military force that canput this opposition into effect. Commanders such as Decimus Brutusmust be voted the senatorial authority and resources needed to con-46et quidem, quo melior senator videatur, negat se illi amicum esse debere: cum suo magnoesset beneficio, venisse eum contra se. vide<te> quanta caritas sit patriae: cum homini sit iratus,tamen rei publicae causa defendit Antonium.47uno in homine, Q.

The main way in which Ciceroattempts to generate this support in the Senate is through elaborate,fulsome praise of the commanders’ achievements. In Philippic3, forexample, he celebrates D. Brutus’ loyalty to the state with a resound-ing exclamation (Phil.3.8):Decimus Brutus’ manifesto is recent, it has just been published. Assuredlyit must not be passed over in silence. He promises to keep the provinceof Gaul in the control of the Senate and People of Rome. A citizenborn for the Commonwealth, mindful of his name, following in thefootsteps of his ancestors!48Octavian, Lucius Egnatuleius and two Roman legions receive simi-larly enthusiastic praise (Phil.3.3–7), and the same tactics are employedin Philippic5, where the achievements of M. Lepidus are earnestlyextolled, along with those (again) of Octavian and D. Brutus (Phil.5.36–46). Cicero likewise eulogizes M. Brutus’ military accomplish-ments in Philippic10, as he attempts to have the general’s claims tothe governorship of Macedonia recognized by the Senate (Phil. 10.11):There was a storm, great Heavens, a ravaging conflagration, the destruc-tion of Greece, but for the amazing, superhuman courage which quelledthe madman’s reckless enterprise. How speedily Brutus acted, how cir-cumspectly, how boldly!49The praise in such passages can have several functions. The mostobvious is to persuade the Senate to support the generals in ques-tion. By celebrating their achievements Cicero shows why these mendeserve senatorial backing, and the elevated, enthusiastic language isdesigned to evoke a similarly positive emotional response from theaudience. His aim however extends beyond merely practical support.There is a moral high ground to be claimed as well. In a civil warwhere the line between constitutional and unconstitutional acts wasbecoming increasingly blurred, official pronouncements of praise andhonors become important for helping to define the ‘good’ cause fromthe ‘bad.’ As we have seen, the Senate consistently shrinks fromdeclaring Antony a hostis. But the more decrees Cicero can persuade48hoc vero recens edictum D.

The honorific decrees proposed in Philippic14 for thosewho died fighting against Antony at Mutina thus take on an impor-tant symbolic dimension. And in Philippic9 Cicero exploits the debateover the honors to be awarded to Servius Sulpicius Rufus for a sim-ilar purpose. The facts regarding Sulpicius’ death were plain enough;he had succumbed to illness while serving on the embassy to Antony.But through a rather strained argument, Cicero tries to claim thathe had effectively died a violent death at the hands of an enemy ofthe state (Phil.9.7):Therefore I say, Leptines did not kill Octavius, nor the king of Veiithose whose names I have just mentioned, more certainly than Antoniuskilled Servius Sulpicius. For obviously he who was the cause of deathis responsible for it.50Cicero recognizes that if he can persuade the Senate to awardSulpicius the honors usually given only to an ambassador slain bythe enemy, the decree can be depicted as a moral pronouncementabout the conflict as a whole (Phil.9.7; see also 9.3).But there is also a further persuasive intent behind some of thepraise and honorific decrees presented in the Philippics. Cicero aimsnot just to convince the Senate to support certain generals; he alsohopes to exert some kind of influence on the generals themselves. Thisis seen most clearly in the cases of Octavian and Lepidus. By be-stowing official recognition upon their achievements Cicero tries toinduce them to work within the constitutional framework rather thanagainst it.Cicero himself hints at this manipulative aim in Philippic5, althoughhe dresses it up in the lofty terms of aristocratic gloria(Philippics5.49):51It is a law of nature, Members of the Senate, that once a man hascome to a perception of true glory and perceived that in the eyes ofthe Senate, the Roman Knights, and the entire Roman People he isa valued citizen and a benefit to the Commonwealth, he will thinknothing comparable to this glory.5250non igitur magis Leptines Octavium nec Veientium rex eos quos modo nominavi quam Ser.Sulpicium occidit Antonius: is enim profecto mortem attulit qui causa mortis fuit.51On this appeal to aristocratic gloria, see E. Narducci, Modelli etici e società: Un’idea di Cicerone(Pisa: Giardini 1989): 137–41.52ea natura rerum est, patres conscripti, ut qui sensum verae gloriae ceperit quique se absenatu, ab equitibus Romanis populoque Romano universo senserit civem c[l]arum haberi salutaremquerei publicae, nihil cum hac gloria comparandum putet.296 MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 296"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The argument here is clearly designed to allay the Senate’s fearsthat men such as Lepidus and Octavian will misuse the extraordi-nary privileges that Cicero proposes for them. Public recognition ofa person’s achievements, he claims, acts to spur that person on toachieve even greater success. Such assertions, however, should notbe dismissed merely as opportunistic rhetoric. Other examples sug-gest that Cicero firmly believed that praise and honors could be usedto influence another’s actions. His praise in Philippic1 of a numberof Antony’s actions following Caesar’s assassination (Phil.1.31–33)seems designed to inspire Antony to emulate this kind of behaviorin the future (note the references here once again to aristocratic glo-ria). And a fulsome letter of praise to Dolabella in May 44 alsoclearly had the same intent.53The most explicit acknowledgementof this aim, however, comes in a letter to M. Brutus, in which Cicerogives his reasons for the lavish praise bestowed on Lepidus in thefifth Philippic(Phil. 5.38–41). These proposals for honors were intended,he claims, to temper the man’s crazed determination for conflict (adBrut. 1.15.9):We tried to bring him back from treason by honoring him, but our wisdom was defeated by the folly of a thoroughly irresponsibleindividual.54Brutus disapproved of these tactics (ad Brut.1.15.3), and as a rhetor-ical strategy they do appear naively optimistic given the ruthless polit-ical arena in which Cicero was trying to apply them. His handlingof Octavian in particular lies open to criticism. The enthusiasticpraise in Philippics3 and 5 of the young man’s (unconstitutional) mil-itary actions against Antony played a crucial role in consolidatinghis position. At Cicero’s suggestion the adulescenswas made propraetorand member of the Senate; seven months later he was leading hisarmy through Italy against Rome (Phil.3.3–4; 5.42–46).5553Fam.9.14.6 (= Att.14.17A): qua re quid est quod ego te horter ut dignitati et gloriaeservias? (‘What reason is there for me to urge you to cherish your reputation andpersonal glory?’). Cicero evidently also included a eulogy of Dolabella in his firstdraft of Philippic2; Atticus advised him to make it less effusive (Att.16.11.2). Seealso the approach that Cicero adopts in his private letters to Munatius Plancusaround this time (Fam.10.3; 10.5; 10.6), and cf. Prov. 38.54nos illum [sc. Lepidum] honore studuimus a furore revocare. vicit amentia levissimi hominisnostram prudentiam.55See also the comments of D.

The example tells us more perhaps about thelimitations of the Senate and senatorial oratory at this time thanabout Cicero’s political acumen. While the Philippicsin general wereimportant for shaping military policy within the debating chamber,the Senate’s ability to control those outside it was becoming evermore precarious. When it denied Cassius imperiumin Syria (contraryto Cicero’s urgings in Philippic11), the general proceeded to marchagainst Dolabella anyway (Fam. 12.11.1; ad Brut. 2.3.3).56And theease with which Octavian had raised an army shows all too clearlythe degree to which the Senate was already at the mercy of thelegions and their generals. If we can take Cicero’s explanation in hisletter to Brutus at face value, he was well aware that his support ofLepidus was a gamble. But with the conventional mechanisms ofgovernment rapidly proving ineffective, it was perhaps a risk worthtaking. The resourceful orator attempts in difficult circumstances toexert on events whatever influence he can.StyleThe Philippicsraise two important issues with regard to Cicero’s lin-guistic style. The first involves sentence structure. As W. R. Johnsonnotes, in these speeches Cicero generally avoids a highly periodicstyle. Long, elaborately structured sentences are now the exceptionrather than the standard mode of expression, and are used only forspecial emphasis. Indeed, according to Johnson’s statistics, the aver-age sentence length in the Philippicsis only 18.7 words, considerablylower than the average for Cicero’s earlier speeches, which rangesbetween 22 and 26 words.57There are certainly some methodolog-ical problems with Johnson’s analysis;58but the phenomenon that itidentifies does seem to be a real one.56Cf. Phil. 11.27: nam et Brutus et Cassius multis iam in rebus ipse sibi senatus fuit.(‘For both Brutus and Cassius have already been their own Senate on a numberof occasions’). Cicero thus declares his own definition of constitutional action to behighly subjective and flexible.57W. R. Johnson, Luxuriance and Economy: Cicero and the Alien Style(Berkeley:University of California Press 1971): 46; 68.58The main problem lies in Johnson’s sampling, which draws on only the open-298 MAY_f10_272-304 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 298"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Several reasons may lie behind this stylistic change. As we haveseen, Cicero’s rhetorical aims require him to generate a sense ofurgency within his audience. One of his favorite techniques for achiev-ing this is the vigorous, energetic use of rhetorical questions. InPhilippic3, for example, he employs them in some 22 of its 36 sec-tions; in Philippic7 they appear in 18 sections out of 27. Since suchquestions are most effective when combined with a swift, clippedsentence structure, their frequent use may contribute in part to theperceived rapidity of the Philippics’ style.59Furthermore, as we haveseen, Cicero’s confrontational manner leads him to employ a gooddeal of sarcasm throughout the speeches. This too is the kind ofdevice that loses much of its force if extended across too long a sen-tence. Moreover, on a broader level the context of urgent senator-ial debate may also exert its own pressure towards an economy ofstyle. Cicero in general eschews elaborate set-piece oratory, prefer-ring instead to keep his speeches sharply focused on the discussionat hand.But these explanations may not by themselves suffice to explainthe phenomenon. The preference for shorter sentences is not in factconfined to the Philippics. It appears also in the Caesarian speechesof 46 and 45 B.C., a fact that points to some larger influence beyondthose of the immediate rhetorical context.60The most plausible expla-nation is that Cicero’s style has been influenced by recent literarydebates, in particular by criticisms of the florid ‘Asiatic’ oratory withwhich he was closely associated.61His rhetorical treatises of 46 B.C.certainly indicate a close engagement with these stylistic issues.62Andwhile he mounts in them a vigorous defence of his own literarying thirty sentences of each speech. See the remarks of M. Winterbottom, ClassicalReview 24 (1974): 70–71, and M. L. Clarke,Greece and Rome 19 (1972): 100. Tac.Dial.22.2–3 observes that the orations composed towards the end of Cicero’s lifeare brisker and less discursive than his earlier efforts.59As a simple comparison, Catil.3 uses rhetorical questions in only 3 of its 29sections, Catil.4 in 7 out of 24. In Catil.1, on the other hand, where Cicero’s aim,as in the Philippics, is to provoke some kind of decisive action, they are used farmore frequently (in 20 sections out of 33).60See H. C. Gotoff, Cicero’s Caesarian Speeches: A Stylistic Commentary(Chapel Hilland London: University of North Carolina Press 1993): xl–xliii, who likewise notesthe additional influence in these speeches of the immediate rhetorical context.61This is essentially the conclusion of Johnson (1971): 61–63, although he phrasesit in typically provocative terms (with references to Cicero’s ‘vanity’ and ‘shame’).62Brut.284–91; Orat.23.

Indeed a letter from May 44shows the matter to be an ongoing concern. Cicero sends Atticus aversion of the speech that he believes Brutus shouldhave made on16th March following Caesar’s assassination. The question of howplain (‘Attic’) or elaborate (‘Asiatic’) the style should be is a centralone (Att.15.1a.2):I fear though that you may be led astray by your surname and judgeit too Attically. But you have only to call to mind Demosthenes’ thun-derbolts to realize that a speaker can be both impeccably Attic andprofoundly impressive.63It is unfortunate that this speech has not survived. As a fully elab-orated oration designed for delivery at a contio, it would help us tojudge more precisely whether Cicero’s leaner style in the Philippicsis part of a broader shift within his oratory as a whole, or a resultprimarily of their immediate rhetorical context. At present the ques-tion remains open, although a more complete statistical study of thePhilippicsand the Caesarian speeches may be able to shed more lighton the matter.64The least that can be said is that the rapid style ofthe Philippicsturns out to be thoroughly appropriate. Its brisk, directlanguage suits well Cicero’s urging of decisive opposition to Antony.The influence of Demosthenes also figures prominently in stylis-tic studies of the Philippics.65Certainly it is clear that a few of Cicero’sexpressions are modeled directly on passages from Demosthenes’speeches;66and the letter to Atticus just quoted shows Cicero’s keen63quamquam vereor ne cognomine tuo lapsus ÍperattikÚwsis in iudicando. sed si record-abere Dhmosy°nouwfulmina, tum intelleges posse et ÉAttik≈tata<et> gravissime dici.64The study of L.

Problems arise however when we move from preciseverbal parallels to the use of similar ‘rhetorical themes,’ a phrase whose vaguenessmakes difficult any definite identification of Demosthenic influence.

There are in fact two ways in whichCicero—who suggested the title ‘Philippics’ only half seriously (adBrut.2.3.4)—may have thought it an appropriate one. First he mayhave wished to compare his fierce ad hominemattacks on Antony withDemosthenes’ invective against Philip of Macedon. If this is the case,the title has a direct relevance to only a few of the fourteen speeches.69Alternatively, he may simply have wished to draw attention to therole of prominent statesman that he adopts in them. This indeedwas the way in which he had applied the term some years earlierwhen writing to Atticus about several other speeches (Att.2.1.3):Remembering what a brilliant show your countryman Demosthenesmade in his so-called Philippicsand how he turned away from thisargumentative, forensic type of oratory to appear in the more elevatedrole of statesman, I thought it would be a good thing for me too tohave some speeches to my name which might be called ‘consular.’70The description that he offers here can be readily applied to hisown Philippics, given their emphasis on his activity in the Senate anddivergence in approach from his forensic speeches. If this was indeedwhat he had in mind when he first suggested the title to Brutus, the‘Demosthenic influence’ was presumably not conceived as extendingto detailed matters of style.7167Cicero also depicts Demosthenes as a desirable oratorical model at Brut.35and 289; cf. Orat. 23.68Opt. gen. 14. Cicero notes here that he has also translated Aeschines’ opposingspeech, a point generally underplayed by those stressing the Demosthenic influencein the Philippics.69Cf. G. Kennedy, The Art of Rhetoric in the Roman World 300 B.C.–A.D. 300(Princeton: Princeton University Press 1972): 270.70fuit enim mihi commodum, quod in eis orationibus quae Philippicae nominantur enituerattuus ille civis Demosthenes et quod se ab hoc refractariolo iudiciali dicendi genere abiunxerar utsemnÒterÒw tiwet politik≈terowvideretur, curare ut meae quoque essent orationes quae con-sulares nominarentur.71The title was not universally adopted by the ancients.

His powers in this final stage of hiscareer, however, show no sign of stagnation or decay. He appliesthese familiar strategies with great skill and invention, often on ascale, and with a consistency, not attempted elsewhere. Perhaps thequality that stands out most of all in these speeches is their vigor.Gone is the sometimes shrill, sometimes irresolute political postur-ing of the 60s and 50s. Absent too the clever yet often glib rhetor-ical sleight of hand that figures so prominently in his forensic speeches.72Cicero is at last his own man, and his oratory is all the better forit. His formidable oratorical powers are finally directed towards aclearly defined cause in which he fully believes. This conviction inhis mission produces a confrontational, often caustic directness thatendows the Philippicswith an austere gravitasrarely found in earlierspeeches.It was a conviction, however, that cost Cicero his life. By December43 he was dead, hunted down and executed by Antony’s agents. Forthe rhetorical teachers and students of the early empire, this violentend furnished fertile material for their declamations, with speecheson whether Cicero should burn his writings to save his life, and evermore gory versions of Antony’s abuse of his corpse.73Other moreperceptive critics of the imperial period, however, could discern some-thing of the symbolic significance of the Philippics. They are indeeda turning point in the tradition of Roman deliberative oratory, thelast great attempt to pursue Republican government through themechanisms of senatorial debate. Hereafter deliberative oratory wouldbe severely limited in its scope, circumscribed by the princeps’ sword(or, more tactfully, the blessed peace of his government).74In DeOratore3.1–8 Cicero celebrates the oratorical swan-song of his polit-ical mentor, L. Crassus, delivered a few days before he died. It was,he claims, a defiant oration, bravely upholding the senatorial causein the face of dangerous opposition. Cicero with his Philippicsmorethan emulated this esteemed example.72Cf. Wooten (1983): 70.73Sen. Suas. 7 and Suas. 6, esp. 6.10–27.74Tac. Dial. 37.6.

CrawfordCicero is known to have delivered hundreds of speeches in the courseof his long and illustrious career in the courts and in the Senate ofRome. Many of these were published and have been preserved tothe modern day in their entirety. Others were damaged in trans-mission and have come down to us in fragmentary form.1Yet athird group of speeches, which are known to have been delivered,are completely lost to us. These may have been published and sub-sequently disappeared without a trace, or they may never have beenpublished at all. In this paper, I will discuss the lost and fragmen-tary speeches, offering some theories as to why they suffered such afate and placing them in their political and personal context withinCicero’s career. As some of the fragmentary speeches have substan-tial remaining parts, I will provide a more in-depth analysis of thecontext, content, and construction of these speeches.Our knowledge of the lost or unpublished speeches is entirelybased on references to them in Cicero and in other ancient authors.2From these testimoniawe may reconstruct their context, but rarelycan we discover anything of their actual content. Yet despite theselimitations, these speeches are important for understanding more fullyCicero’s oratorical career.

This is what is meant by ‘publication’ inCicero’s day,4and in every case it involved a conscious choice onhis part. Many factors may have led Cicero to publish his speeches,not the least of which was his status as a novus homo, a ‘new man’.He did not have a famous family name on which to trade, nor washe rich, nor a successful military man. His route to the consulshiphad to be based on the reputation that oratory could earn for him,and the best way to ensure that his reputation was solid, and moreimportantly, memorable, was to be selective about what he publishedand what he did not publish. Other factors may be considered impor-tant as well, such as the intent to provide exempla for students ofrhetoric,5so the desire to create positive propaganda or to justify aparticular political stance should not be regarded as Cicero’s onlyreasons for publishing his speeches. But any theory of publicationmust also imply a theory of non-publication, and it is this question—why Cicero choose not to publish some of his orations—that I willexamine in more detail.There were a number of reasons that appear to have influencedCicero to withhold a delivered speech from publication, but the gen-eral principle seems to have been that Cicero usually decided againstpublishing a speech when he thought that there was more to be lostthan gained from its dissemination. Frequently suppression of speechescan be directly related to political pressures, and the desire to avoidMAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 306"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"offending in print, as it were, a powerful individual or group. Forexample, when Cicero was twice pressured by Pompey to undertakethe defense of Aulus Gabinius in 54, he strenuously tried to refuse(see the Letters to Atticus and to Quintus in September and Octoberof 54). But Pompey prevailed; even though Cicero had given testi-mony against Gabinius during the divinatio(the process of selectingthe prosecutor) prior to the first trial, he was ultimately convincedto defend him at the second prosecution. Gabinius was first acquit-ted, then convicted; Cicero published neither of his speeches con-cerning this unpopular defendant because he did not wish to offendPompey, nor to appear to be his lackey. A further reason for dis-sociating himself from Gabinius was no doubt the fact Cicero dis-liked him intensely.A similar situation is seen in the case of the defense speech forC. Calpurnius Piso, charged with extortion in 63. The prosecution,brought by Caesar, was politically motivated: Piso had opposedPompey’s overseas commands, and now Caesar was showing his sup-port for Pompey by attacking his enemies. Cicero undertook thedefense of Piso because Piso had supported him in his consular can-didacy. His advocacy was successful, and Piso was acquitted. Cicerodid not publish the speech, despite the fact that he had made hisfirst defense of a consular defendant,6and a successful one at that,because he saw that to do so could offend Pompey and Caesar whilegaining him nothing from Piso. This was a prudent, tactful, andstrategically sound move for a sitting consul, who needed the sup-port of both Pompey and Caesar far more than that of Piso.Thus it appears that in making choices regarding the publicationin cases such as these, Cicero is attending to the advice given in theCommentariolum Petitionis(53).7The author of this piece on election-eering points out that while a politician is involved in an electoralcampaign, he should not involve himself with controversial issueseither in the Senate or before the people, lest any group take offenseat his position or doubt his loyalty to them. Cicero, as his career6See W. C.

Thus each timehe gave a political speech, or defended someone in the courts, hehad to consider whether it was to his advantage to publish the ora-tion or not.The sum of such decisions reveals patterns of publication in Cicero’scareer. Not unexpectedly, given the potential political impact of pub-lished speeches, which had wider dissemination and greater perma-nence than those that were heard once, Cicero frequently chose topublish his orations. Yet suppression was equally important. If welook at all the known speeches of Cicero, we see that there are 83that may be considered unpublished,8as against 58 extant, 16 frag-mentary,9and five10probably published and subsequently lost—atotal of 79. It is clear that Cicero decided not to publish more thanhalf the time. A chronological look at the pattern of such decisionswill reveal much about Cicero’s developing career and the chang-ing influences and pressures that he felt as he climbed from anunknown new man to the pinnacle of power in Rome. After his for-tunes were reversed, we can see how his decisions regarding publi-cation changed as well. The Table (see below, 327) illustrates thepattern of Cicero’s activities and reflects his principles of selection.In the first ten years of Cicero’s career, there are fourteen pub-lished speeches, of which eleven are extant, two are fragmentary,and one was probably published and lost. In the same period, thereare eight unpublished. Of the published speeches, almost all (13) areforensic, while of the non-published pieces, six are forensic and twopolitical. One may draw two conclusions from this information. First,it is clear that Cicero is far more involved in the courts than in pol-itics; political speeches account for less than 14% of the total. Inview of his own words at De Officiis2.47–51, where, after mention-ing the fame that comes from eloquence, he claims that the great-est reputation can be won by defending an innocent person in a8These speeches and their dates of delivery are discussed in detail in Crawford(1984).9U. Schindel, “Ein neues Redefragment Ciceros?” Hermes122 (1994): 367–68,proposes that a fragment of a Ciceronian oration may be found at Quintilian 8.6.43.This is possible, but not convincing, and in any case, it would have to be listedamong the fragmenta incertae sedis. See Crawford (1984): 295–300.10These are Pro TullioI; Pro M. FonteioI; De lege agrariaIV; Cum provinciam incontione deposuit; and De consulatu suo.308 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 308"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"legal proceeding, this is not surprising. Secondly, we see that Ciceropublished more speeches (14) than he withheld (8), which shows thatat this stage in his career he was willing to go on the record moreoften than not. This is certainly to be expected, since oratory—par-ticularly published oratory—was the best way for an unknown yettalented political newcomer to make his name and reputation, whichwas Cicero’s main goal during this period.11In the next ten years, during which Cicero was elected to thepraetorship (65) and the consulship (63), a distinct change is seen.There are twenty-two forensic speeches (seven extant, six fragmen-tary, one probably published, and eight not published) and thirty-two political speeches (eight extant, six fragmentary, three probablypublished, and fifteen not published). In this decade there are morepolitical speeches than forensic (32 to 22), and the number of speecheswithheld from publication increases somewhat, to 43% of the total(23 are suppressed and 31 are published). As Cicero’s political activ-ity increases, so does his selectivity in the matter of the publicationof his speeches. Again, this should not surprise us. Having bolsteredhis name recognition and laid the foundations for a political careerthrough forensic patronage and other, more overtly political means,Cicero now enters the competition for the top political prize—theconsulship. Because his status as a new man places him at a distinctdisadvantage, he must become increasingly cautious in deciding whatto publish and what to withhold. Clearly, now that his political careeris underway, Cicero has more at stake and more to risk by publi-cation of a speech containing indiscreet remarks about an opponent,or one which endorses an unpopular position. When there is moreto lose than to gain by publication, Cicero is duly cautious, and hisbehavior reflects this fact.The fifties were not kind to Cicero, and he suffered serious reversesin his career and staggering blows to his prestige. Due to the machi-nations of his most hated enemy, P. Clodius Pulcher, he was exiledfrom Rome for a year and a half in 58–57. Upon his return, it soonbecame clear to him that the political climate had changed consid-erably. Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, the ‘triumvirs,’ had succeededin usurping the political process to an unprecedented degree, and11For Cicero’s exploitation of his youth and inexperience as a defense strategy,see H. Gotoff, “Oratory: The Art of Illusion,” Harvard Studies in Classical Philology95(1993): 289–313, at 302.    309MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 309"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"the violence and unrest engendered by Clodius and others madenormal political life impossible. During this period, Cicero becomeseven more selective about which speeches he allows to be published;in fact, he withholds a good deal more than he publishes (44 to 17).Moreover, of the sixty-one orations known from this decade, thereare forty forensic speeches, and only twenty-one are political. Obviously,Cicero is far more active in the law courts (which, it must be said,are heavily politicized at this time) than in the political arena. Thisreflects Cicero’s marginalized position in the triumviral system ofgovernment; his main role seems to have been to defend the tri-umvirs’ allies whenever they were prosecuted (as in the case ofGabinius cited above).12Also not unexpected is Cicero’s extremeselectivity in publishing his speeches in this hostile and uncertainpolitical environment. Caution had to be Cicero’s watchword, andthis is shown by the fact that less than 30% of his output is pub-lished in this decade. This applies both to forensic speeches (twenty-nine not published, eleven published) and political orations (fifteenwithheld, six published). So in all aspects of his public life, Ciceroreflects the difficulties he faced and the restrictions placed on himby the ‘triumvirs’ in this period.In the final years of Cicero’s life (49–43), Rome was swept bypowerful forces that offered hope to Cicero for the restoration ofthe Republic, yet that ultimately resulted in the end of republicanRome and in Cicero’s own death. The wrenching uncertainties ofthe Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, and Caesar’s final vic-tory, although distressing for Cicero, pale in comparison to his ter-rible grief over the loss of his beloved daughter, Tullia, in 45. Thisblow caused Cicero effectively to abandon public life and to turn tothe solace of philosophical writing, a position that suited him wellduring the dictatorship of Caesar. During Caesar’s rule, Cicero gaveonly three orations, the so-called ‘Caesarian speeches,’ of which oneis forensic and the other two are political. Otherwise, Cicero remainedentirely aloof from the law courts and from politics as well until theassassination of Caesar in March of 44.13After that, Cicero re-entered12Other defense briefs which Cicero undertook at the behest of the triumvirsare Pro Cispio(57–54), Pro Druso(54), and Pro T. A. Balbo(55).13A recent study has even shown that Cicero let himself get out of shape. Afterthis period of forensic and political inactivity, his sentence length becomes shorter,with fewer words per strong stop; this indicates that he had lost some of his prodi-310 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 310"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"the political arena once again, with a burst of activity aimed pri-marily at ridding Rome of Marc Antony and bringing about therestoration of the Republican form of government. In the last yearand a half of his life, Cicero gave twenty political speeches; all butfive of these were published. Here we see Cicero wielding his prin-cipal weapon, published oratory, in a way that is reminiscent of hisearly career. He makes sure that his opinions are heard and thatthey remain in the public consciousness as published speeches. Althoughhe failed to restore the Republic (and became a victim of Antony’sproscriptions), his effort was remarkable.Now that we have gained an overview of the patterns of publi-cation and suppression of speeches in Cicero’s oratorical career, wemay turn to a closer examination of some of the factors that affectedCicero’s decisions about publication.In general, Cicero took into account two factors in consideringspeeches for publication or not: practical and political. The firstinvolves such mundane criteria as how busy Cicero was,14whetherhe had previously published on the issue at hand, or whether hehad already successfully defended the client.15Sometimes perhapslack of interest in a client or an issue at Rome was a determiningfactor. Only the people of Reate, for example, would have caredabout Cicero’s speech on their behalf in 54. Similarly, it seems thatfew people would have been interested in the fate of D. Matrinius,a low-level clerk, following his trial in 67.16Sometimes speeches weremade in a proceeding that was dropped; such efforts rarely werepublished17(although after Verres fled Rome and abandoned his casein 70, VerrinesII–IV were published in full).Another consideration was probably aesthetic. One would like toassume that Cicero engaged in a form of quality control, and thatgious breath control through lack of practice. See B. Frischer, “How To Do Thingswith Words per Strong Stop. Two Studies on the Historia Augustaand Cicero,”Aspects of Latin. Papers from the Seventh International Colloquium on Latin Linguistics(Innsbruck:Institut für Sprachwissenschaft der Universität 1996): 585–599.14Soon after Cicero returned from exile in 57, he gave two speeches on Sept.7 on the question of who should be in charge of the grain supply for Rome. Neitherof them was published due to the rush of events surrounding Cicero’s return.15For example: Pro Q. Caecilio Metello Celeri(63); Pro Sestio de ambitu(52); and thespeech De imperatore adversus Dolabellam deligendo, the substance of which is containedin Philippic11.16Others of this sort are: Pro C. Mustio(74 or 73); Pro Sthenio Thermitano(72); ProCispio(54?); Pro libertate Tenediorum(54); and Pro Saufeio(52).17As in the case of Q. Mucius Orestinus (before 64).    311MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 311"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"if he did not think that a speech met his high standards, he wouldrevise it before publication (as is known to have happened to thePro Milone). But if he thought it was not worth the effort, such anaesthetically deficient speech would remain unpublished. Sometimes,too, Cicero might choose to suppress an unsuccessful speech, suchas the defense of C. Antonius in 59, or his remarks De Lege Flaviain 60.18There are somewhat unusual practical reasons for non-publicationof a speech as well. For example, Cicero occasionally gave speechesin Greek, a practice that was frowned upon by some (see Verr.2.4.147); these speeches were not published. Sometimes there was(or seemed to be) a conflict of interest, or Cicero’s sympathies werewith both sides of an issue, or simplest of all, he personally dislikedthe client or the cause that he was representing.19In some cases,multiple factors worked to preclude publication, and so the decisionwas made on several levels.It should be noted that in principle the genre of a speech seemsnot to have mattered in the decision to publish or not. In the courts,Cicero normally spoke for the defense, as he regarded the role ofpatronusas the most noble (De Officiis2.51). Since he rarely took therole of prosecutor or testified against defendants in court, few suchspeeches are among his published work. Yet the fact that prosecu-tion speeches are found among the published speeches leads us toconclude that there is no generic reason not to publish them. Onthe political side, there are speeches to the Senate and to the peo-ple (in contionibus). The latter are rather rare; only eight survive (onea tiny fragment). Thus, publication of speeches given at contionesdidoccur, and so one cannot rule out the possibility of deliberate sup-pression based on genre. The same is true ofsententiae(when theword means ‘speech’) given in the Senate, although this designationis sometimes controversial.20Political reasons for the deliberate suppression of speeches aremore complex and less likely to be ascribed with certainty. The prob-lem is that one must prove two negatives: that the speech was not18But he did revise and publish the Pro Milone(52), which had failed resound-ingly when it was delivered.19Such speeches include Pro Bestia(56) and In P. Autronium Paetum(62); Pro Gabinio(54); Pro C. Messio(54) and Pro P. Cornelius Dolabella(52).20For more on this issue, see Crawford (1984): 16–19.312 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 312"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"published, and that publication would have been detrimental toCicero’s political standing in some way. In this investigation, it isthe connection of one case with others like it which may be ouronly clue. For example, when Cicero was seeking the consulship, hedid not publish his speeches De C. Manilio(66), In Oligarchos(66), orPro C. Orchivio(65) because he did not want to offend potential sup-porters of his campaign. Likewise, as consul, he carefully maneu-vered to keep both Pompey and Caesar happy, so as to be able tocount on their help, by not publishing the Pro C. Calpurnio Pisone(63).To avoid offending Cato, several speeches, including the De LocationeAsiaticain 61 and In P. Clodium Pulchrumin 56, appear to have beenpurposely suppressed. The speech De Rege Ptolemaeo(56) was not pub-lished in order to spare Pompey’s feelings. The remarks Cicero madeagainst Vatinius’ candidacy for the praetorship in 54 could only havecaused trouble while offering no advantage to Cicero. And finally,it should be noted that on occasion Cicero seems to have been look-ing out for his own feelings. He did not publish his speech on revi-sions of the tax contracts in the East in 61, because its failure sawthe end of his beloved concept of concordia ordinum. Nor did he pub-lish a speech supporting Caesar, given in the Senate in 56, becauseit showed his capitulation to Caesar after the conference of Lucaand exposed his own weak position in the current political situation.Clearly, the factors urging suppression of a given speech weremany and varied, and frequently more than one was involved. Theissues were not always clear-cut for Cicero, and they are even lessso for us. Yet the concept is valid, and the problems are illustrativeof the issues facing the orator in the last years of the Roman repub-lic. Most importantly, the study of the lost and unpublished orationscan add to the understanding of Cicero’s oratorical career beyondwhat can be known through the extant speeches alone.The study of the fragmentary orations21of Cicero presents diversechallenges, requires different methodology, and offers distinct rewards.These speeches, which number sixteen, are every bit as importantas the extant orations, in that Cicero thought them worthy of pub-lication after their delivery and saw to it (with one exception) that21For the purposes of this study, I define as fragmentary those speeches whichwere published in antiquity but are known to us now only through citations inother authors. Thus, speeches such as the In Pisonem, the Pro Tullioand the ProScauro, which have substantial lacunae and badly damaged beginnings, are not con-sidered fragmentary.    313MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 313"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"they were copied and circulated.22Each of them provides valuableinformation about Cicero’s political and/or forensic activities and theturbulent times in which he lived and worked. Yet what remains forus are only fragments, ranging from a single word or phrase to asmany as ten or twelve consecutive lines. The fragments have beenpreserved by a wide range of authors, from Cicero himself to writ-ers active in the 6th century A.D.23Most of the citations come fromgrammarians and rhetoricians such as Quintilian, Priscian, Aquila,Charisius, Arusianus Messius and the like, who commented on par-ticular words or phrases in the speeches available to them. Such cita-tions are usually short, but the scholiasts, Asconius Pedianus and theso-called Bobbio Scholiast, preserved longer pieces of the speechesand wrote often lengthy comments on them. These are the mostinteresting and informative, of course, but even the tiny bits canoffer some insight into Cicero’s handling of a legal matter or pro-vide us with some understanding of his political position on an issue.There is no clue as to the circumstances which led to the dam-age (or, in some cases, to the near-complete loss) of these orations.No ancient pattern of publication or of collection in antiquity canbe found which would explain why these particular speeches werepreserved only as fragments.24Only chance could account for thewide range of types of speeches that have suffered such damage.There are speeches that deal with public and private legal matters,religious issues, elections, business, and of course, politics. There arespeeches delivered in the courts, in the Senate and to the people,for friends, enemies, opponents and supporters, associates and clients.The speeches date from the 70s, when Cicero’s career was just get-ting started, to near the end of his life in 43 B.C. Nor can we besure that the authors who quoted from them actually had the pre-served speech—they might well have been quoting at second hand.22The exception is the In P. Clodium et Curionem, which was given in 61 and notpublished by Cicero, but then was circulated without his knowledge or permissionwhile he was in exile. For more on this speech, see below, 324–326.23See L. D. Reynolds, ed., Texts and Transmission(Oxford: Clarendon Press 1983):54–57, on the survival (or not) of the texts of Cicero’s speeches.24On the question of how Cicero’s speeches were collected and organized inantiquity, see J. E. G. Zetzel, “Emendavi ad Tironem: Some Notes on Scholar-ship in the Second Century A.D.,” Harvard Studies in Classical Philology77 (1973):225–243. During the medieval period collections appear to be random (Reynolds[1983]: 57 ff.).314 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 314"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Thus we do not know how their preservation came about; it appearsto be sheer luck that any of them are preserved at all.25In dealing with the fragmentary speeches, one must carefully extractCicero’s ipsissima verbafrom the surrounding context of the authorwho is quoting them. One must also take care not to confuse thetestimoniawith the text, for to do so results in a mistaken notion ofwhat the speech contained and ascribes words and ideas to Cicerothat are not his. It is important, however, to provide enough of theembedding context to make clear the sense of the quotation (althoughthe purposes of the quoting author may inform his text in ways thatare not discernable) so that relevance of the fragment may be apparent.When the fragments have been securely identified, they can some-times be arranged in order on rhetorical grounds, or following thelogical sequence of Cicero’s argumentation in the case at hand. Eachfragment can be analyzed for its content and its contribution to theargument can be assessed; all the relevant information can then beput together in an analysis of and commentary on the speech itself.There are sixteen fragmentary speeches of Cicero known today.Of these, five have come down to us only in a single fragment; theyare Cum Quaestor Lilybaeo Decederet, given in 74 after he had completedhis service as quaestor in western Sicily; Deor Pro C. Manilio, whichis dated to late 66 or early 65, and concerns the trial of C.

There are six of these, four of which areforensic and two are political. Five of the six are relatively early inCicero’s career (before the consulship), and were useful to the ora-tor as he made his way in Roman politics. The sixth, delivered earlyin 62, amounts to a defense of his actions as consul and was clearlya significant speech on a critical issue. Quite a lot can be gleanedfrom the fragments of these orations, and in most cases the struc-ture of the speech can be seen, revealing the defense strategy Ciceroadopts or the treatment he chooses for the issues at stake. A closerlook at some of the speeches in this group will illustrate this point.27The Pro Varenois the earliest of the fragmentary speeches, data-ble to the early 70s.28L. Varenus was accused of the murder of tworelatives and the attempted murder of a third. It appears from theremaining bits of the speech that Varenus may have been set up;one of the prosecutors was a professional accusator, and the trial hasa suspiciously ‘open and shut’ feel to it. Nevertheless, the youngCicero undertook the case and did his best, albeit in a losing cause.From the fragments we can see that Cicero took the offensive, try-ing to divert the charges to hired killers, playing with the prosecu-tors’ statements to show their lack of credibility, and using delayingtactics. After an opening that was designed to arouse pity for thedefendant, Cicero names the principal accuser, gives the charges,and immediately tries to distance his client from them. He employsthe cui bonodefense, arguing that the people who benefited from thedeaths of the victims should be considered the probable murderersand actually names them in the speech. He contends that they arethe real criminals and poor Varenus was entrapped and implicatedby them in a crime that he did not commit. Despite these tactics,Cicero’s defense was not successful and Varenus was convicted(Quintilian 7.2.36). His strategy had failed, and yet he published thespeech. At this point in his career, Cicero was anxious to gain recog-nition, and perhaps it did not matter to him that he had fought alosing battle, as long as the speech itself was well thought of. And27Little is known about Cicero’s defense of C. Fundanius, probably to be datedto 66, and the five fragments that remain from the speech offer hardly any eluci-dation. For the details, see below, 318 and Crawford (1994): 57–64.28The exact date is unknown, but parallels with the trial of Sex. Roscius ofAmeria (in 80) and connections to the Sullan proscriptions point to an early date.316 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 316"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"it was—Quintilian, for example, later cited it with admiration as anexample of a flexible and creative defense.In 69 Cicero defended P. Oppius on charges of assault29broughtagainst him by M. Aurelius Cotta, Oppius’ commander in the provinceof Bithynia. Once again we can see from the seven fragments remain-ing from this speech what Cicero’s plan of defense was. First he sug-gested that there was no attack on Cotta at all. He impugned thecharges, claiming that they were inconsistent and improper, andwould set a bad precedent. He appropriated the prosecution’s tac-tics when it suited him, forcing them to choose between untenablealternatives. He attacked Cotta (though carefully, as he was a per-sonal friend), using irony and sarcasm. We do not know whetherOppius was convicted or not, but Cicero was sure to publish thisdefense championing a man of equestrian rank, since he needed thesupport of that group in his continuing bid for higher political office.Politics is the focus of the next speech in this group, the De RegeAlexandrino(65). This speech was delivered in the Senate on the ques-tion (much vexed) of the proposed annexation of Egypt by Crassus,and the challenges that proposal raised for Pompey and Caesar.Cicero opposed the annexation, as did the conservatives in the Senate,thus acquiring their support and showing at the same time that hewas looking out for Pompey’s best interests. The speech was a suc-cess, and Cicero published it as a ‘position paper’ designed to fur-ther his political career at the critical time of his consular canvass.The remaining fragments of the speech, and the embedding con-text provided by the Bobbio Scholiast, reveal very clearly how Cicerotreated this issue. He begins (fragments 1–3) by decrying Crassus’greed, possibly deliberately blurring the distinction between greed forwealth (of which Crassus had plenty) and power (of which he wantedmore). He continues the speech with a discussion of honesty and theneed for moral standards in public and private life (fragments 4, 5,and 8), and investigates the causes for just war (6 and 7). These top-ics could well be applied to a discussion of the relative merits ofPompey and Crassus; in this part of the speech one suspects thatcontrasts were drawn between the two rivals. Cicero also takes theopportunity to accuse the current Egyptian rulers of committing mur-der and mayhem (9 and 10). All of the fragments thus point to29Or extortion, or theft; the evidence is unclear.

Fundanius on unknown charges. Five fragments remainfrom this speech, but they offer virtually no insights into the defensethat Cicero mounted in this case. We do not even know the exactidentity of the defendant, nor whether the defense was successful.However, as the speech was most likely delivered and published priorto Cicero’s consular canvass, we may speculate that Fundanius wasacquitted, and that Cicero regarded his support as an importantpolitical asset.30The trial of Q. Gallius occurred in 64. Gallius was indicted byM. Calidius for bribery that he allegedly had committed during hiscampaign for the praetorship in 66. We know that the trial wasdelayed for two years, for Gallius served as the Praetor in chargeof the court which tried Cornelius for treason in 65 (see below).31The accusation thus seems to have been brought by Calidius forpersonal reasons, since there would not have been any reason to tryto oust someone from an office that he had already held. Calidiusperhaps hoped to benefit from provisions in the lex Calpurnia de ambitu,which allowed a successful prosecutor to take the rank (and someprivileges) of a convicted defendant. Whatever the reasons for theprosecution, Cicero’s defense speech was very widely read and quotedin antiquity, even though it seems that Gallius was convicted,32andthe seven fragments which remain show a varied and lively defense,including two sharp and witty attacks on the prosecution speechesof Calidius.The last speech in this group, Contra Contionem Q. Metelli, is asignificant political expression on Cicero’s part. It was delivered to30Fundanius was one of the four members of sodalitates, or ‘brotherhoods,’ whomCicero defended on various charges and from whom he therefore expected supportin his consular canvass. See the Commentariolum petitionis19.31For a full discussion of the date of this trial, see Crawford (1994): 145–46.32This is inferred from the fact that fifteen years after this trial, Gallius’ rela-tives (probably his sons) undertook a retaliatory prosecution of Calidius. Had Galliusbeen acquitted, there would have been no need for such revenge.318 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 318"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"the Senate in 62, a few days after the end of Cicero’s term as con-sul, in response to a highly critical review of his consulship by Q.Metellus Nepos, a tribune of the plebs. Nepos’ primary attack onCicero focused on the decision to put five members of Catiline’sconspiracy to death without a trial. Cicero argues in the remainingfragments of this speech that it was the Senate’s decision, not hisown, to do this; although this argument is in fact invalid (Cicero aspresiding consul would have had the ultimate responsibility for theSenate’s actions), it was convincing. The senators voted to nameCicero pater patriae, and to make illegal any further efforts to retali-ate against those who had punished the conspirators. Cicero’s coun-terattack on Metellus Nepos was thus certainly effective, for the timebeing, at least,33and in the unrest that followed the Senate’s decree,Nepos was suspended from office and had to leave Rome altogether.Why did Nepos lead this attack on Cicero, at such cost to him-self ? His goal seems to have been to bring about the recall of Pompeyfrom the East to take over the army now fighting Catiline and theremnants of his band. In this he had the backing of Caesar, whoseems to have been supporting Pompey’s interests as well. The factthat the commander of the armies facing Catiline was Nepos’ ownbrother, Q. Metellus Celer, further complicates the picture. It is myopinion that Nepos’ goal was to create animosity between Ciceroand Celer, who had been a strong supporter of Cicero’s actions asconsul. In this he was somewhat successful, as a rift between thetwo did arise (see Ad Fam. 5.1), but Cicero was able to smooth itover (Ad Fam. 5.2). Although the publication of his speech chastis-ing Metellus Nepos could have further offended Celer, it seems notto have done so, and rather solidified Cicero’s position in the Senateand in the public eye.34From the ten remaining fragments, we can see that Cicero’s speechhad a two-part thrust. First he mounted a counterattack on Nepos,and then sought to explain his actions with regard to the conspirators,33Cicero was later (in 58) forced into exile by P. Clodius Pulcher, who arguedalong the same lines that Nepos apparently used in 62, holding Cicero responsiblefor putting Roman citizens to death without a trial.34It is likely that the complete speech would have contained many other pointsrelating to Cicero’s successful consulship, and covered other areas besides the issueof the execution. Thus the speech would have served as a favorable summary ofCicero’s consulship, deserving of publication.    319MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 319"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"concluding by placing the blame for their deaths clearly on theSenate.

Here Cicero claims that he did not bear the ulti-mate responsibility, and his speech Contra Contionem Q. Metellieffectivelydefends that claim.Five of the fragmentary speeches offer substantial portions of pre-served text, from which we can attempt the reconstruction of theargument and the rhetorical arrangement of the oration. The twospeeches Pro Cornelioand the In Toga Candidawere the objects ofcommentary by Asconius Pedianus; the speeches In P. Clodium etCurionemand De aere alieno Miloniswere studied by the Bobbio Scholiast.Fortunately for us, both commentators preserve much of the origi-nal speeches, by citing them in their work.The first two of these orations, the Pro C. Cornelio Iand II, weregiven by Cicero in defense of the tribune of the plebs, C. Cornelius,in 65. These two speeches were thus very important, coming as theydid in the critical year before Cicero began his consular canvass inearnest. The charge against Cornelius was treason (maiestas) and thetrial was fraught with political implications requiring adept handlingby Cicero to ensure that he did not alienate powerful supporterswhile at the same time making a defense that also revealed his ownpolitical stance on current issues. Let us take a closer look at thesecritical speeches, of which a total of eighty fragments survive.C. Cornelius was a protégé of Pompey, who had served underPompey in Spain and was tribune of the plebs in 67. During histenure in this office, Cornelius was accused of maiestas, because hehimself had read aloud a bill that he was proposing after anothertribune, P. Servilius Globulus, had vetoed it. A trial was begun anddisrupted in 66, amid allegations that the prosecution had beenbought offand that Cornelius’ own gang of thugs had been behindthe violent acts that led to the suspension of the trial. In 65 theprosecution was reopened (following the conviction of another tri-bune, C. Manilius, on similar charges), and Cicero undertook thedefense. Although Cornelius had the backing of Pompey, he alsohad powerful enemies, and it seems that Cicero took some risks indefending Cornelius; however, he would have not hesitated to lend320 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 320"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"his support to Pompey’s former quaestor, and he was sympatheticto the reforms that Cornelius was attempting to introduce.35The defense was difficult, because Cornelius had in fact flauntedthe veto of Globulus, at an assembly in full view of the people ofRome. Cicero could not deny the facts of the case, nor did he try.Rather, he claimed that Cornelius had merely read out his bill toclarify it, and had in fact obeyed Globulus’ veto by immediately dis-missing the assembly after his reading. Thus no diminution of anothertribune’s power or of the power of the Roman people (one of thedefinitions of maiestas—a complex and poorly understood law) hadoccurred, and Cornelius was innocent. The jury agreed, having beenconvinced by Cicero’s skillful guidance though a daunting tangle oflegal interpretations and political pressures.The extant fragments of the speeches for Cornelius show howCicero accomplished this feat.36In the first speech, he begins withan exordiumdesigned to arouse compassion in the jurors and putthem in a mood sympathetic toward the client. Fragments 1–4 belongto this part of the speech.37The narratio, which explains the facts ofthe case, is very short as preserved; it is represented by only twofragments (5 and 6).38Then Cicero begins a digression (fragments7–18) in which he ridicules the prosecution and tries to disconnecthis client and himself from the recently convicted Manilius. Thesepoints, though minor, have to be addressed before Cicero begins themain portion of the defense (the argumentatio, represented by frag-ments 20–45). In fragment 19, however, we find the partitio, statingclearly and succinctly the matters which he will treat in the argu-mentatio. Cornelius is accused of having 1) passed a bad law; 2) vio-lated the tribunician veto; and 3) committed sedition. These three35See M. Griffin, “The Tribune C. Cornelius,” Journal of Roman Studies63 (1973):196–213.36My analysis is based on that of K. Kumaniecki, “Les discours égarés de Cicéronpro Cornelio,” Med. Kon. Vlaam. Acad. Belg.32 (1970): 3–36, but reflects an empha-sis more grounded in traditional rhetorical theory. I have also rearranged the frag-ments slightly.37In his review of the Fragmentary Speeches, “Fragmina Tulli,” Classical Review47(1997): 50–52, J. G. F. Powell rightly notes (51) that these four fragments do notmake up the entire exordium, as I had implied (96).38Powell (1997): 51, argues that the length of the narratiocannot be assumed,because we have not got all of the speech. This is true, but I would point out thebrevity of the narratioin the Pro Caelio, and Austin’s remarks thereto (R. G. Austin,ed. M. Tulli Ciceronis, Pro M. Caelio Oratio[Oxford: Clarendon Press 1960]: 45).    321MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 321"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"allegations are then answered in order by Cicero. In fragments 20–27he argues that bad laws can be amended, and as Cornelius was will-ing to amend his bill, he cannot be guilty. Fragments 28–33 dealwith the issue of Cornelius’ violation of Globulus’ veto; Cicero answersthis charge with the claim that his client only read his bill to clar-ify it, and indeed dismissed the assembly before a vote could betaken. Finally, in fragments 34–45, we find Cicero attempting toshow how Cornelius was a benefactor to the republic rather than aseditious villain. There is a great deal of extraneous material in thispart of the speech. Examples from history, marginal issues and gen-eralizations on a variety of topics seem purposely to obscure the cen-tral facts, and seem to have been included to draw the jurors’ attentionaway from the weak case that Cicero in fact had. Certainly this isa good and well-known Ciceronian tactic. The remaining fragmentsof the peroratio, 46–55, include some of the usual pathetic appeal (55)as well as a summary of the issues of the trial.39Cicero’s second speech for Cornelius has only 18 extant fragmentsand is much less rich in information and rhetorical artistry than thefirst speech. Moreover, it seems to reflect quite closely the interro-gation of witnesses and Cicero’s reactions to their testimony.40The speeches for Cornelius were successful. His client was acquit-ted, and Cicero added to his reputation as a powerful orator in sup-port of the innocent victim of political maneuvering by people whodid not have the best interests of Rome at heart.The next fragmentary speech to consider is the purely political InToga Candida. Delivered in the Senate in 64, right before the con-sular elections, it was clearly a success, for Cicero was elected con-sul at the head of the poll. It is unlikely that the speech per se, whichis an attack on his rivals, C. Antonius and L. Catilina, directlyinfluenced the outcome of the election; the vote went to Cicero asa moderate supporter of the middle class and the middle road, andwas not a protest vote against the other candidates. Nevertheless, wecan see from the 27 surviving fragments of the oration (all preservedby Asconius) that it was a powerful and vigorous invective.Most of the extant fragments are aimed at Catiline, and attempt39Fragments 56–62 cannot be located with any sense of security, though somemay well belong in the peroratio.40The speech has the following rhetorical structure: Exordium; Demonstratio(show-ing the witnesses’ prejudices); Confutatio(attack on the witnesses); Digressio(on wealth);and Peroratio.322 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 322"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"to show how he is completely unsuited to serve as consul, due tohis numerous wretched crimes against society (and against membersof Cicero’s own family, as well). Cicero attacks Catiline very strongly,discussing offenses including murder, adultery and incest (in contrast,Antonius gets offrather lightly, being accused of behaving badlytowards provincials and getting himself expelled from the Senate).Cicero gave this speech in response to a tribune of the plebs, Q.Mucius Orestinus, who had vetoed a proposed new anti-bribery law,and in doing so had insulted Cicero publicly by stating that he wasnot worthy to hold the consulship. Thus the ostensible reason forthe speech is a discussion of bribery, and that is where Cicero begins.The proper order of the fragments is not that preserved by Asconius,who had his own reasons to rearrange them,41but it is possible toreconstruct the rhetorical structure of this compelling piece.In the first fragment, Cicero goes on the attack against his rivalsimmediately, alluding to clandestine meetings held by them to assurethe support of those they have bribed. He asserts in fragment twothat this is the only way they can hope to succeed, because theyhave no friends; he goes on to show that Catiline in particular hasoffended the Senate, the courts, the people of Rome, and Cicerohimself (fragments 3–6). He returns to his opening theme in the nexttwo fragments, claiming that Catiline and Antonius will have to starta slave war, or use gladiators, or step up the bribery in order togain election. Having thus set forth a general picture of what dis-asters might come from his opponents, Cicero then presents threecolloquia, first with Catiline, then Antonius, and finally Mucius (thetribune whose remarks spurred Cicero to give the speech).The colloquiumwith Catiline is the longest, consisting of 12 frag-ments, and the nastiest. Cicero rakes Catiline over the coals for pastcrimes (and murders) committed during the Sullan proscriptions, fordespicable personal behavior (including not-so-veiled references toadultery and incest), mistreatment of allies, flaunting of the law andthe law courts, and plots against the leaders of the state.

For a full treatment of this issue, see Crawford (1994): 168–172.42There was probably more to this than remains now, but Asconius’ greaterinterest in Catiline explains the uneven balance. The two fragments chastise Antoniusfor unsportsmanlike behavior in chariot races and for ingratitude toward Cicerohimself, who helped him get elected to the praetorship in 66.    323MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 323"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Mucius, who is the subject of a heavy blast of irony and sarcasm.The last two fragments, which belong in the peroration, leave theaudience with a sense of unease relating to the opening lines of thespeech.

Rather, the speech, delivered in 61, was‘leaked’ to the public during Cicero’s exile, in 58. This caused Ciceroconsiderable distress, and he tried to have it dismissed as a forgery(Ad Att. 3.12.2), because he thought that it might have a negativeeffect on his efforts to be recalled. It is clear, however, that it isCicero’s own work; one fragment of it actually comes verbatim froma letter of Cicero to Atticus (1.16.9), in which he discusses both aset speech against Clodius and an altercatiowith him. Both probablyserved as sources for the fragments that have come down to us.Most of the extant speech is aimed at Cicero’s enemy, P. ClodiusPulcher.43This is not surprising, since the speech was delivered inthe Senate shortly after Clodius was acquitted of offenses relating tohis illicit presence at the rites of the Bona Dea in the previous year.Cicero had given damaging testimony against Clodius, destroying hisalibi; nevertheless, the jury, allegedly bribed, dismissed the charges.In the aftermath of the trial, Cicero addressed the Senate to encour-age them and reassure them against fears of what Clodius might donext. Of course, he took the opportunity to lambaste Clodius thor-oughly, using a combination of wit and invective to malign him per-sonally and to lament the lack of true justice in the Roman state.4443On the career of P. Clodius Pulcher, see Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune(Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1999). Tatum provides a detailedanalysis of the Bona Dea scandal in pages 62–86, and discusses this speech at 87–89.44Apparently he also attacked Clodius’ patron C. Scribonius Curio, the trial jury,and M. Pupius Piso, consul in 61, but no fragments concerning these have survived.324 . MAY_f11_305-330 7/11/02 8:53 PM Page 324"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"The structure of the speech is fairly straightforward; the remark-able thing about it is the invective, which is cutting, witty, and wide-ranging. The speech is comprised of an exordium, followed by a digressio,which discusses Clodius’ financial difficulties, and then the argumen-tatioproper, which contains the bulk of the invective. There is butone fragment remaining of the peroratio. In the exordium(fragments1–6), Cicero sets the scene and deals with the outcome of Clodius’trial, briefly but with biting sarcasm, signaling here the mood ofmuch of the speech. Fragments 7–17, with an interruption at 13 inwhich Cicero ironically touches on Clodius’ religious practices (anobvious reference to the Bona Dea scandal), outline how Clodiusplans to repay his vast debts by getting a rich province to plunder.That he is a dishonest opportunist is the thrust of this section.The argumentatio(fragments 18–32), is the real tour-de-force of thisoration. Cicero uses several of the stock themes of invective,45includ-ing ridicule of one’s appearance or dress, one’s ancestry and origins,criticism of behavior such as gluttony, immorality, extravagance anddebt, and pretentiousness, to attack Clodius in an extremely funny,yet cruel, way. In the first two fragments of this onslaught, Cicerotakes up the subject of Clodius’ presence at Baiae, that great resorttown on the Bay of Naples, actually calling him forth in a sort ofprosopopoieiato defend himself. He foreshadows here the famous pas-sage in the Pro Caelioin which Clodius’ renowned ancestor AppiusClaudius Caecus appears.46In the next four fragments, the oratormakes great fun of Clodius’ dressing up as a woman (as he did inorder to gain entrance into the rites of the Bona Dea, reserved forwomen only). He details each item of clothing, describes the fittingroom, and concludes with Clodius’ looking into a mirror, declaringhimself ‘pretty’ (a pun on his cognomen, Pulcher). Fragments 25–32concern the trial itself, its outcome, and the bribery charges sur-rounding it; this part is more serious in tone, but still contains ele-ments of humor.

Considering its uncertain dispositionin antiquity, we are fortunate that it survived at all.The last of the fragmentary speeches that I will discuss was deliv-ered in the year 53. Although it is titled De Aere Alieno Milonis(OnMilo’s Debts), it is in fact mostly about Clodius. Only one of the 25fragments (all preserved by the Bobbio Scholiast) mentions Milo byname, while 21 concern Clodius. Obviously, Cicero has taken theoccasion of defending his friend and long-time ally T. Annius Miloagainst allegations raised by Clodius in the Senate to turn the tableson his enemy and attack him. Rather than the personal invectivethat he employed against Clodius in the earlier speech, here Ciceroaims his remarks more generally, seeking to show to his audience,the Senate, how Clodius had caused serious disruption to the stateand to its leading citizens by his irrational and violent behavior. Miloand his alleged debt is no threat at all; rather it is this madman,Clodius, who has endangered the city and all that is dear in it.Cicero’s hostility to his enemy is clear and unrelenting. From theprooemiumstraight through to the end of the extant fragments, Ciceroattributes all sorts of reckless and threatening acts to Clodius. Theseinclude bribery; violence, at the polls and elsewhere; the attemptedmurder of Pompey; making false accusations; proposing irresponsi-ble laws; and of course, immorality (de religionibus violatis...de inces-tis stupris[fragment six]). It is an impressive display, and as such wasan important speech for Cicero. In it he clearly addresses Clodius’untrustworthiness and the threat that his power, though waning, stillposed for Rome and for Pompey. It is a political speech about apersonal enemy, yet it is no less effective for that reason.The lost and fragmentary speeches of Cicero represent an impor-tant source for a fuller understanding of his career and of the greatissues that he faced throughout his public life. When these orationsare integrated into the body of extant speeches, a clearer view ofhis development as a politician, statesman, advocate, and oratoremerges.

It was not meant as acompliment: a Roman consul ought not to be joking during a seri-ous trial about electoral corruption. Moreover Cato, who was oneof the speakers for the prosecution, was the victim of the jokes, forCicero had just been making the audience laugh by ridiculing hisinflexible, unrealistic Stoic beliefs.1That a Roman audience would laugh at jokes even by a consulneed cause no surprise; Cicero himself, in a long digression on witin his De oratore, stresses the effectiveness of humor in oratory. Whatmay be more surprising is that they laughed at jokes that presup-posed knowledge of Stoic philosophy. The explanation is ostensiblyto be found in the speech itself. Near the beginning of the passagein question, Cicero says that his audience ‘is not an ignorant crowdor some gathering of rustics,’ and that intellectual pursuits (studiahumanitatis) are familiar and even dear to them.2A different picture,however, emerges from a passage in the fourth book of his De finibusof 45 B.C., which is part of a fictional discussion between Cato andhimself about Stoic moral philosophy, supposed to have taken placein 52.

On the one hand, the episode indicates that even theeminently intellectual subject of philosophy was ‘popular,’ in the sensethat many members of the Roman upper classes (and probably evensome segments of the lower ones) had some knowledge of it, andwould be flattered by the suggestion that they did. On the otherhand, it shows that this knowledge was generally quite superficial,and that familiarity with technical details and the willingness andability to engage with the issues was restricted to a minority. Thepassages from the two works thus illuminate each other, but unfor-tunately they still fail to tell us, for instance, the size of this minor-ity, or exactly how superficial the knowledge of most Romans was.Most issues of the intellectual life of this period of cultural tur-moil show similar complexities, and accordingly, scholarly opinionabout them is sometimes sharply divided. At the same time, manyof these issues are relevant to Cicero’s rhetorical works, which touchon many subjects outside ‘rhetoric’ narrowly defined, and are firmlyrooted in the contemporary intellectual environment. An adequatetreatment of the intellectual background of these works, therefore,would have to be book-length. In this relatively brief and selectivechapter, some important subjects must be left out altogether—notably,the question of libraries and the availability of books—, while oth-ers can be only summarily treated.3MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 332"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Before focusing on some of the more specific issues in sections4–6, I shall discuss two topics of general importance. The first, brieflytreated in section 2, is Roman attitudes to Greek culture and learn-ing. They are relevant here both because Cicero’s writing was greatlyinfluenced by the attitudes of his potential readership, and becausethe background of many of his own views is to a large extent Greek.The second topic concerns another important factor shaping the con-temporary debates: the fact that many of the subjects discussed byCicero were thought of as the special province of professionals—‘grammarians’ (where matters of language and literary scholarshipwere concerned), rhetoricians, and philosophers. Section 3 addressessuch questions as the social status and the typical activities of someof these professionals.Some other crucial general factors are more difficult to pin downand are therefore often ignored. Particularly for the members of theRoman upper class, there were numerous opportunities for discus-sion, thinking, and reading that were not tied to the context of pro-fessional teaching. A good example is the private gathering at thehouse of Cicero’s friend Atticus sometime in May 45, where thelearned Greek grammarian Tyrannio seems to have given a read-ing of his work on Greek accentuation. We may also think of thedelightful opening scene of the third book of Cicero’s De finibus(3.7–10), with its encounter between Cicero and Cato in Lucullus’library; this encounter is no doubt fictional, but such meetings musthave taken place. And of course there was private reading, oftenmentioned, for instance, by Cicero in his letters. Especially notableis the description by Antonius, the interlocutor of De oratore, at apoint in the dialogue where he is still at pains to distance himselffrom a wholehearted acceptance of intellectual pursuits (2.59–61).When he is at leisure at his villa in Misenum, he says, he readsGreek authors—not, he emphasizes, the philosophers (who are tooabstruse) or the poets (who are too difficult), but those who wrotespeeches and history. The existence of such informal, relativelyunstructured intellectual activities should not be forgotten in ourreconstructions. Also in this regard, intellectual life in Rome was acomplex matter.44For Tyrannio’s reading see Cic. Att.12.6.2 (for the date, see Shackleton Baileyad loc.); in general, see esp. Griffin (1994): 694–696; and Rawson (1985): 51–52;Fantham (1996): 41–42.      333MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 333"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"2.Greek learning in a Roman worldIntellectual activities are of course often frowned upon by peoplewho regard themselves as ‘practical,’ and this was also true in Greeceand Rome. In Rome, however, this sentiment usually took a specificform: intellectual activities were ‘Greek’ and therefore not properlyRoman. In the first book of De oratoreSulpicius, one of the youngerinterlocutors, suggests that Crassus, the chief interlocutor, shouldexpound his views on the existence of an ‘art’ of speaking. Crassusinitially reacts with indignation. ‘Are you treating me like one ofthose idle and jabbering little Greeks—learned and well read as theymay be—, posing me a trivial question on which to talk any way Ilike?’ (1.102: Quid? mihi nunc vos, inquit Crassus, tamquam alicui Graeculootioso et loquaci et fortasse docto atque erudito quaestiunculam, de qua meo arbi-tratu loquar, ponitis?).5In the same vein, some fellow-Romans dis-paragingly called Cicero himself a ‘little Greek.’6At the other endof the scale, Cicero was not the only leading Roman politician whohad thoroughly assimilated Greek learning. Cato the Younger is aclear example, as is Caesar, who wrote, among many other things,a treatise about the technical issue of grammatical analogy (cf. below,352–354).The existence of such widely differing attitudes to Greek culturehas given rise to equally widely differing scholarly views. For exam-ple, Jocelyn, concentrating on philosophy, argued that from the early2nd century B.C. onwards, the Romans generally looked at the sub-ject and its (Greek) practitioners with suspicion, and that attitudessuch as Cicero’s and Cato’s were confined to a very small minor-ity. On the other hand, Gruen contends that all rejections of thingsGreek were merely symbolical, token acts, meant as public affirmationsof Roman cultural autonomy by a Roman establishment which infact welcomed Greek culture. Such extreme analyses are, in my view,one-sided.75All translations from De oratoreare taken from J. M. May & J. Wisse (transl.,intr., etc.), Cicero.

This ‘gray area’ is difficult to chart with anyprecision, due not only to a relative lack of sources to supplementCicero, but also to the inherent complexity of such matters. To startwith, many people will have held no clearly articulated or even con-sistent views, and will have reacted differently in different situations.The ‘ignorant’ jurors in the trial of Murena, for example, wereflattered into appreciating Cicero’s discussion of philosophical issues,but if someone had actually called them ignorant they would nodoubt have reacted very differently—feelings of hostility to intellec-tuals and Greeks might well have become apparent. Moreover, toler-ably articulated positions could and did come in very different kinds.The latter point is clearly illustrated by Cicero’s preface to his Definibus(1.1–12). He there defends his undertaking to write about phi-losophy in Latin by answering the objections of four groups, whichhe first lists in the opening section. There are those who, though‘not unlearned,’ reject philosophy altogether, others find it accept-able provided the efforts expended are limited, and yet others wouldprefer Cicero to write about other subjects. And some Romans takea totally different attitude, preferring to read about philosophy inGreek—snobbishly, as Cicero implies (1.10, cf. 1.5). Apart from suchcritics, he also had readers, and according to De officiis2.2 his bookshad even encouraged many to take up writing about philosophythemselves. All of this already makes up a variegated picture, yet itonly concerns philosophy, the most theoretical and ‘Greek’ amongintellectual subjects. When we also take into account the differentattitudes to different types of Greek writing, as witnessed, for exam-ple, by ‘Antonius’’ statement paraphrased above (333: De or.2.59–61),it becomes clear that the spectrum of Roman attitudes to Greek cul-ture was extremely broad.Press 1992), esp. 223–271. Jocelyn’s scepticism is useful as an antidote against somelofty visions of the effect of Greek philosophy on Roman society, but his argumentas a whole is unbalanced. E.g., of Cicero’s critics mentioned in Fin.1.1 (see below)he only mentions those hostile to philosophy, not the ‘snobs’ who preferred to readGreek ([1977]: 361 with notes 11–12). Gruen relies, inter alia, on assumptions aboutconcerted policies of ‘the Roman establishment’ which are more at home in thelanguage of the 1960’s than in an analysis of Roman society; and on a factualinterpretation of selected passages from Cicero’s dialogue De oratore(see A. D.Leeman, H. Pinkster, J. Wisse, M. Tullius Cicero. De oratore libri III. Kommentar. 4.Band: Buch II, 291–367; Buch III, 1–95[Heidelberg: Universitätsverlag C.

For instance, he probably had no great tastefor philosophical disquisitions, but when on Rhodes in 66 and 62B.C., he made a point of visiting and listening to the illustrious StoicPosidonius.8This, like, for example, the episode from Murena’s trial,seems to suggest that in this period acceptance of Greek culture wasdominant, despite strong opposing voices.The variations in attitude naturally created a tension betweenacceptance and rejection of Greek learning, both externally, betweenthe different attitudes present in Roman society, and internally, ona personal level. The external tensions are clear from the abusedirected at Greeks and at Cicero himself (above). The tensions ona personal level are likewise well exemplified by Cicero himself, whooften appears uneasy about his own ‘un-Roman’ predilection forintellectual activities. This uneasiness was no doubt partly due to theabuse to which he was subjected, but at least one other, more per-sonal factor contributed to it. For despite his intellectual calling,according to his own conviction his place was in Roman politicallife. Addressing his brother Quintus in the preface to De oratore, heregrets that the political situation makes it impossible to pursue ‘thearts to which we have been dedicated from boyhood,’ but also makesit clear that this call of politics cannot be ignored (1.1–3). In gen-eral, the question of the right balance between the vita activaandthe vita contemplativacontinually occupied him.9The existence of tensions where Greek intellectual accomplishmentsare concerned is further illustrated—and partly proved—by De oratore.The ideal orator sketched in this work is a Roman orator-statesmanwho at the same time possesses universal knowledge, especially ofphilosophy. On the one hand, this implies a thoroughgoing commit-ment to intellectual pursuits. On the other hand, remarks like thatof the interlocutor Crassus quoted above, about ‘idle and jabberinglittle Greeks’ (1.102), are found in many parts of the work, and are8See Posidon. T35–39 EK.

Particularly noteworthy is apassage in the third book (3.75), where Cicero makes Crassus referto an incident in Athens, where, as quaestor on his way home fromhis province, he had arrived just two days late to attend the famousEleusinian Mysteries. He demanded that the celebration be repeatedfor his sake, and was angry when this was refused—behavior clearlyreflecting the Roman feelings of superiority over the Greeks. ThatCicero himself would almost certainly never have acted thus, andmay even have regarded Crassus’ demand as arrogant, only enhancesthe significance of his addition of the story. And indeed, the pas-sage follows closely upon Crassus’ long and learned account of howGreek philosophers followed the example of Socrates in rejecting elo-quence (3.56–73). It was clearly important to Cicero at this point tocounter the possible impression that Crassus’ mastery of Greek intel-lectual subjects made him ‘un-Roman,’ and to leave no doubt thatadmiration of Greek intellectual accomplishments did not stand inthe way of healthy feelings of Roman superiority.10Less conspicuous but no less crucial to the same work is the waythat Cicero, particularly in the third book, argues for his view ofthe ideal orator’s philosophical knowledge. Employing a strategy notunknown from his speeches, he only gradually reveals this ‘intellec-tual’ view to the reader. The use of this cautious technique of per-suasion clearly reflects the sensitivities in this area that he expectedin his readers.11Interestingly, Cicero’s approach in some other works is notablydifferent. From his early De inventione(untypical in this as in otherrespects), traces of cultural ambiguities are wholly or virtually absent.Probably, the youthful enthusiasm of the seventeen-year-old Cicerowas not yet sensitive to such issues; the apparent lack of a clear view10Other examples of the various aspects of Cicero’s attitude and presentation:1.195 (the Twelve Tables superior to all philosophical libraries); 2.17–18 (playfulanalysis of the concept of ineptus[‘unfitting, tactless,’ etc.], supposedly absent fromthe Greek language); 1.22 and 3.56–57 (remarks about Greek leisure); and, on theother hand, 3.137 (reference to the Greeks is unavoidable where learning is concerned).11For this technique see below, 379–383 and 383 with n. 11; and Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996): 93–95; May & Wisse (2001): 18–19.

This is not to say that theydo not show some related concerns. When in OratorCicero is aboutto launch into a technical discussion of word arrangement, he defendshimself for doing so (140–148); for instance in 144, he admits thatteaching lacks dignity if it resembles teaching in a low-level school(si quasi in ludo), but that he sees no reason to reject it if it is doneby means of advice, exhortation, etc. (si monendo, si cohortando,...). Inboth works, however, he is far less hesitant to discuss matters Greekand intellectual. The actual discussion in Brutusbegins with a shorthistory of Greek eloquence (26–51), without any of the excuses sur-rounding such topics in De oratore. In Orator, the very first part ofthe work (1–32) is perhaps even more Greek than Roman, with ref-erences to Greek poets and philosophers (4–5) and Plato’s theory offorms (10), his claim that his own eloquence was based on philo-sophical knowledge acquired in the Academy (12–17), and the con-centration on Greek orators in the discussion of suitable oratoricalstyles (24b–32; cf. esp. 31). All this probably reflects Cicero’s focuson his immediate opponents at the time of writing (46 B.C.), theAtticists, whose criticisms of his oratory were the driving force behindthese two works. They were intellectuals like Cicero, and since theybelonged to a younger generation, he may also have felt that theirreceptive attitude to Greek culture was beginning to make his cau-tious approach superfluous.It seems useful to sketch very briefly how the attitude to things Greekhad developed over, roughly, the century preceding Cicero’s matureyears—if only because Cicero fairly often projects his own ideas andattitudes back into the time of the revered ancestors. A favoriteepisode is the famous embassy sent by Athens to Rome in 156 or155 B.C., consisting of the Academic philosopher Carneades, the12As to Cicero’s age, see G. A.

Otherexplanations of the absence of references to the contrast between Greek and Romanare equally possible; see, e.g., G. A.

Catulus,the interlocutor in De oratore, says that Scipio the Younger, Laelius,and Furius, who ‘were always openly in the company of the mostlearned men from Greece,’ were very pleased with the Athenians’choice; ‘they and many others frequently went to hear them speak’(2.154–155).13Such pronouncements cannot be taken as historical.The three Romans mentioned here are part of what used to becalled the Scipionic Circle, an alleged group of supporters of Greekculture around Scipio, portrayed especially in Cicero’s De republica,where they discuss political theory. That the conversations of suchdialogues were fictional and meant to be recognized as such by thereaders is now usually acknowledged, and it is now also generallyassumed that the Scipionic Circle likewise owed its existence toCicero’s fiction (and, in part, to modern scholarship).14But it is moredifficult to say to what degree Cicero believed in the correctness ofhis general picture of the period (as distinct from his fictional por-traits). However that may be, it is in accordance with this generalpicture that in De oratoreand elsewhere he leaves out one elementof the story of the embassy known to us from other authors, viz.,the reaction of Cato the Elder.15Cato was disconcerted by the bril-liant public display speeches of the philosophers, and persuaded theSenate to have them conclude their official business so that theycould leave forthwith.This affair indicates that already in this earlier period, there weretensions of the same kind as in Cicero’s own lifetime, even if thebalance must have been different. The dominant mood in Cicero’slater years was almost certainly one of acceptance, however qualified,of Greek intellectual activities, but that can hardly have been thecase a century before. The Roman perception that Greek intellec-tuals constituted a problem seems to have become more acute whena host of learned Greeks flooded into Italy, shortly after Lucius13. . . P. Africano, C.

Polybius at least suggests that contemporariesfound the influx remarkable.16Among the Romans who welcomedthe development was Paullus himself, who, for instance, saw to itthat his sons (one of whom was the Younger Scipio) were educatedby the best among the Greek teachers.17Considerable opposition tothe growing Greek intellectual presence in Rome, on the other hand,is indicated by the fact that in 161 B.C., the Senate passed a motionmandating the praetor Marcus Pomponius to rid the city of philoso-phers and rhetoricians. Cato’s success, some five years later, in hur-rying the three philosophers out of Rome points in the same direction.Acceptance of things Greek seems to have grown gradually.Education in the basics of Greek rhetorical theory was apparentlynormal when Crassus (born 140 B.C.) was young, and this was pro-vided by Greek house teachers (not yet in schools).18In De oratore(dramatic date 91 B.C.), Cicero portrays his chief interlocutors Crassusand Antonius as very learned, but also as keen to hide their learn-ing from the general public. This, on the one hand, is again partof Cicero’s fiction, and as many of his readers must have realized,the real Crassus and Antonius were less learned than Cicero’s por-trait makes them. On the other hand, the real Crassus took a per-sonal interest in young Cicero’s education, and was clearly not averseto intellectual pursuits.19In and after the 80’s B.C., the process of acceptance must havebeen further hastened by the new influx of Greeks into Rome, amongwhom were now some leading intellectuals. This influx in effectturned Rome into a major Greek intellectual center. One of its causeswas the temporary loss of the appeal of Athens: some of the philo-sophical schools which had dominated the intellectual scene in the16Plb. 31.24.7; cf. the (chronologically vague) reflection in Cic.

Also, in the Roman campaigns in theEast a number of intellectuals were taken to Rome as prisoners ofwar (below, note 38).In the same period, Roman sophistication, in those of Cicero’sgeneration and those coming after that, grew considerably, and someRomans began to develop ideas no less independently than some oftheir contemporary Greek counterparts. As a consequence, a ‘net-work’ consisting of Greek and Roman intellectuals seems to haveemerged, in which there was at least some real exchange instead ofa one-way influence from Greeks to Romans.21It is during this periodof fundamental changes in Rome’s intellectual life that most ofCicero’s works took shape.3.Professionals and others: the disciplines of grammar and rhetoricIn an important sense, Cicero was no rhetorician. For the term‘rhetorician’ is most normally used to refer to a professional teacherof rhetoric, something which Cicero, as an upper class Roman, wouldnever have wanted to be. Teaching was among the activities thatwere, he once wrote, ‘honorable for those whose rank they fit’ (Off.1.151)—not, that is, for Roman gentlemen.22The question of the20On the disappearance of the Academy see J.

M. Schenkeveld,edited by J. G. J. Abbenes, S. R. Slings, I. Sluiter (Amsterdam: VU University Press1995): 78–79. This pattern seems to have continued for some decades after Cicero’sdeath, until the two cultures grew more apart again in the first century A.D. Bythen, however, intellectual activities were barely considered un-Roman anymore.22The sentence in full is as follows: quibus autem artibus aut prudentia maior inest autnon mediocris utilitas quaeritur, ut medicina, ut architectura, ut doctrina rerum honestarum, eae      341MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 341"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"rhetoricians’ social status is obviously important for evaluating Cicero’sattitude towards them, as is the question of what form their profes-sional activities typically took. The same applies to the so-called‘grammarians,’ whose discipline is also relevant to a number of aspectsof Cicero’s rhetorical works. This discipline was not ‘grammar’ inthe normal English sense, but the study of literature (especially poetry)and language, on any level from instruction for children to techni-cal scholarship. In the case of the philosophers, however, centralthough they may be to the understanding of Cicero’s work, suchquestions are less pressing. The most important philosophers men-tioned by Cicero are Greeks based in the Greek world, so their socialstatus is hardly ever in question. Also, the main problem about theiractivities is their stance towards rhetoric and the rhetoricians, whichwill be addressed below (§ 5 and 389–397). So in this section, weshall concentrate on the rhetoricians and the grammarians—alwayswith the caveat outlined earlier (333): the ‘disciplinary’ contexts wereessential, but we may assume that more informal, private settingswere also quite important for the intellectual activities in these fields.As to the relationship between the rhetoricians’ and the gram-marians’ disciplines, the view is still fairly common that both werepart of a strictly defined curriculum, which was taught in successiveschools, and through which most boys and young men—or at leastthose from the wealthier families—were expected to proceed.23According to this picture a boy, starting at seven, first received ‘pri-mary,’ elementary instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic froma teacher of letters (grammatistÆw); then, from eleven or twelve tofifteen, he continued with ‘secondary’ education in the school of agrammaticus, who taught language and literature; after that, he wouldsunt iis quorum ordini conveniunt honestae. Rhetoric must be included in the latter cat-egory; in this context, one should not press the potential contrast between utilitasand Cicero’s strictures, found elsewhere, of the very limited usefulness of the rhetori-cians’ teachings. For the comparatively low esteem of professional teaching cf. Orat.140–148 (above, 338).23The education of girls is not relevant here. Women did not act as public speak-ers, and accordingly, our meager sources contain ‘no indication that girls were givena formal rhetorical training’; but most upper-class girls were probably literate, andsome reached a high level of proficiency in ‘grammar.’ See E. A. Hemelrijk, Matronadocta: Educated Women in the Roman Élite from Cornelia to Julia Domna(London – NewYork: Routledge 1999): 17–58, esp. 20–23; quotation from p. 23 (her account isnot invalidated by her acceptance, for the most part, of the usual standard pictureof boys’ education).342 MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 342"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"often receive ‘higher’ education at the hands of a rhetorician; andfinally, a few would then turn to philosophers.24Cicero never alludesto such a strict pattern, and it has indeed recently become clear thatthe picture is anachronistic. For one thing, such a uniform systemthroughout the Graeco-Roman world is out of the question for most,if not all of antiquity; there was no central authority to impose it,nor could most of the smaller cities have sustained such an elabo-rate set-up. Also, the first grammarian’s school probably appearedonly in the late 2nd century B.C., and in Rome there were norhetorical schools until the late 90’s. Wealthy Romans actually con-tinued to employ house teachers for their children even after theemergence of the schools.25Moreover, the division between the ‘pri-mary’ and ‘secondary’ level did not exist. In Rome and other bigcenters, there were indeed low-level ‘teachers of letters.’ They didnot, however, teach upper class boys, but typically supplied ‘craft lit-eracy’ for the low-born, including even slaves. The poverty of suchteachers was well known, and this profession was socially on a par,for instance, with that of a doorkeeper. The kind of education thatCicero would assume was different. The first teacher encounteredby upper class boys was the grammarian, and they learnt their ABC’sand other elements either before that at home (probably from a pae-dagogus), or it actually fell to the grammarian to teach them thesetoo. The teaching of a grammarian, that is, could start at the lowest,elementary level; but it progressed much further.2624The standard picture is found, e.g., in the two standard accounts, viz., H.-I.Marrou, Histoire de l’éducation dans l’Antiquité(Paris: Seuil 1965) vol. 1: 215–321; vol. 2:63–96; and S. F. Bonner, Education in Ancient Rome(London: Methuen 1977), esp.34–75, 163–327. It is often reproduced, e.g. (in part) by G. A. Kennedy, “HistoricalSurvey of Rhetoric,” in Handbook of Classical Rhetoric in the Hellenistic Period, 330B.C.–A.D. 400, edited by S. E. Porter (Leiden: Brill 1997): 18–19.25The lack of uniformity is shown, for late antiquity, by R. A. Kaster, “Noteson ‘Primary’ and ‘Secondary’ Schools in Late Antiquity,” Transactions of the AmericanPhilological Association113 (1983): 323–346; no uniformity can be supposed earlier.On the late appearance of the ‘schola grammatici’ see A. D. Booth, “The Appearanceof the schola grammatici,” Hermes106 (1978): 117–125. The absence of rhetoricalschools in Rome follows from the affair of the rhetores Latini(below, 344–345). Forhouse teachers see, e.g., below, 344 on Cicero’s nephew; and 345.26On the teachers of letters vs. the grammarians see Booth (1978); id., “Elementaryand Secondary Education in the Roman Empire,” Florilegium1 (1979): 1–14 [=Booth 1979]; id., “The Schooling of Slaves in First-Century Rome,” Transactions ofthe American Philological Association109 (1979): 11–19 [= Booth 19792]; and Kaster(1983): 323–324, 337–341.

Theage at which a boy would transfer to a rhetorician, however, wasnot fixed, and would depend on his talent and the progress he made.Fifteen was probably not unusual, but we find Quintus, Cicero’snephew, at the age of twelve or thirteen diligently studying with therhetorician Paeonius, who acted as house teacher. Moreover, therewas considerable overlap between the teaching of grammarians andrhetoricians: especially early on, in the first half of the 1st centuryB.C., grammarians also taught rhetoric, and even wrote treatisesabout it.27Cicero seems to allude to this when Antonius in De ora-toresays that in ludo, i.e., in a fairly low-level school, the cases givento boys to practice their speaking are very simple (2.100). In gen-eral, Cicero’s comments about and censures of the rhetoricians’ rulesand approaches apply equally to grammarians teaching the subject.When we turn to the two individual disciplines it is most convenientto start with the rhetoricians, and we may begin by noting thataround 100 B.C. or somewhat earlier, the Romans began to desig-nate these professional teachers of speaking by the Greek word rhetor.In Greek, this word (=Ætvr) could also mean ‘orator, public speaker,’but the Romans had no use for a Greek word in referring to Romanorator-politicians. That they did adopt it for the professional teach-ers was no coincidence.28At that time, the subject was still consid-ered a basically Greek thing, and the teaching of rhetoric was stillin the hands of Greek house teachers (below, 345).The first Latin teachers appeared in 93 B.C. with the suddenemergence of the school of the self-styled ‘Latin rhetoricians’ (rhetores27Quintus studying with Paeonius: Cic.

For the distinction between oratorand rhetorsee Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996) on De or.3.81; cf. Suet. DGR25.3; Kaster (1995): 270. Thematter is complicated by the fact that in Brutusand Oratorthe word rhetor, thoughsometimes meaning ‘rhetorician’ (Orat.12, 93), is often used for orators; in theseworks, however, this usage is restricted to Greek contexts, and the reference is usu-ally to Greek orators (Brut.316; Orat.31, 42, 46, 57, 231; in Brut.265 the wordis contrasted with Greek politikÒw; the meaning in Brut.42 is not quite clear).344 MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 344"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Latini), headed by one Plotius Gallus. In spite of abundant scholarlyspeculation, much about this affair is bound to remain unclear, butwe do know that the censors of 92 B.C., Crassus (the interlocutorin De oratore) and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, issued an edictexpressing their displeasure. They thereby succeeded in suppressingthe school, but only very briefly; Latin teachers were active fromthen on. The censors almost certainly did not object to rhetoricalteaching as such, since this was by now firmly established. Theirmain objection, the edict seems to say, was that young men, whoought to be in the forum learning from their elders, could now idleaway their days in a school, which was a place at most fit for boys—which implies, as Schmidt saw, that there had been no rhetoricalschools in Rome before, and this in turn implies that, as mentionedabove, until then rhetoric had been taught by Greek house teachers.29Socially, all of these rhetoricians teaching in Rome, Greeks andRomans, were of lowly status, as teachers generally were (Off.1.151:above). More specifically, Seneca the Elder tells his readers thatRubellius Blandus, who was active from c.35 B.C., was the firstRoman knight to teach rhetoric in Rome, and that ‘before his time,the teaching of the most splendid of subjects was restricted to freed-men, and by a quite unsatisfactory custom it was accounted dis-graceful to teach what it was honorable to learn.’ There may havebeen just a few exceptions to the claim that all were freedmen, butall were certainly of comparable social status.30Rhetoric teachers29For this affair see esp. De or.3.93–94; Suet. DGR25.2 (the latter with the textof the edict). For the date (late in 93 B.C.) see Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996): ad3.93.

Schmidt, “Die Anfänge der institutionellen Rhetorik in Rom,”in Monumentum Chiloniense. Festschrift Erich Burck, hrsg. von E. Lefèvre (Amsterdam1975): 190–195. Schmidt’s article offers the most penetrating analysis of the wholeissue (his overall interpretation of the censors’ motives, however, relies on a faultyuse of De or.); a brief overview of scholarly interpretations and their problems inLeeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996): 304–306.30Sen.

As Seneca’s statement implies, the status of the subject had risenconsiderably by his own time, a phenomenon connected with theemergence and rise of public declamation, popular also among thenobility. This change, however, belongs to the period immediatelyafter Cicero’s death.31Intellectually, Cicero regarded virtually all rhetoricians, Greek andRoman, and wherever they worked, with equal contempt. This isclearest from De oratore, the work most concerned with his stancetowards standard rhetoric; the hackneyed rules that they taught areconstantly criticized, inter alia, as being totally divorced from the reallife of an orator in the forum. But his approaches to rhetorical mat-ters in his other major ‘rhetorical’ works (Brutus, Orator) also differfrom the professional teachers’ handbooks in crucial ways.This social and intellectual inferiority of the rhetoricians is reflectedby the fact that in Cicero’s works, they are mostly anonymous. Theonly real exceptions are a few very renowned teachers who workedin the intellectual centers of the Greek world. Good examples areApollonius of Alabanda (respectfully mentioned De or.1.75, 126, 130)and Apollonius Molon, both of whom worked on Rhodes, the firstat the end of the 2nd century B.C., the second at least into the 60’sB.C. Cicero, on his educational tour of Greece in 79–77, visited andworked with Molon, whom he had previously heard when the lat-ter was on an embassy to Rome in 81 (and perhaps likewise in 87).Given his attitude towards the average impractical rhetorician, it isno surprise that he stresses that Molon was a ‘pleader in real-lifecases’ (Brut.316: actorem in veris causis).32is unclear (Kaster ad 28.1, p. 301, doubts servile origin), as is that of Sextus Clodius(29). So at most two exceptions are known.31On the rhetoricians’ status in Cicero’s time see also Rawson (1985): 76–79;on the later rise of the status of rhetoric cf., e.g., Kaster (1995): xlvi f., 275, 278–279.32Cicero mentions Molon’s visit(s) to Rome and his own visit to Rhodes in Brut.307 (problematic: see A.

As to the exercises, many of these, the so-called progymnasmata,functioned as a preparation for the teaching of rhetorical theory; butthe theory itself was also supposed to be fortified with exercise (cf.Rhet. Her.3.40 exercitatione confirma).33More important for understandingCicero are the rhetorical handbooks with their systematic rules. It isthese rules that Cicero often censures in De oratore, and that seem,to judge by several passages from the same work, to have been thefocus of the criticisms of the philosophers in their attacks on therhetoricians. They were, apparently, generally seen as quite centralto the rhetoricians’ activities, and were also generally known: in mostof his mature rhetorical works Cicero supposes a fairly thoroughknowledge of them on the part of his readers.34In line with the dramatic date of De oratore, 91 B.C., the refer-ences in this work are to Greek rhetoricians and their handbooks(relevant to those working in the Greek world and to those in Rome).But Cicero cleary intended the work to be relevant to the situa-tion of 55 B.C., when it was written, so we must assume that hiscomments were equally applicable, for instance, to Roman rhetori-cians of his own day. This is confirmed by the two earliest surviv-ing Latin handbooks, Cicero’s own youthful De inventioneand theanonymous Rhetoric for Herennius, which was probably written in the80’s B.C. For what we find in these conforms exactly to the pictureof standard rhetoric in De oratore.35So at least in the Ciceronian33Cicero comments on (advanced) exercises in De or.1.147–159; cf. 2.96–97; cf.A.

Exercisesfor boys (on ‘declamatory’ themes) are mentioned in 1.244 and 2.100. On the pro-gymnasmatasee the convenient overview by Bonner (1977): 250–276 (who on pp.270–272, however, assumes that theseswere always part of these, which is prob-lematic—see below, 359–360).34Explicit references to the handbooks in De oratoreare fairly common (De or.1.85, 86, 105; 2.10, 84; 3.121), to the rules even more so. For Cicero’s censuresof the latter see, e.g., 2.77–84; 3.54; J. Wisse, Ethos and Pathos from Aristotle to Cicero(Amsterdam: Hakkert 1989): 90–91, 192–199.

Here, it is relevant to note thatthe areas with which they were concerned were fairly restricted.Rhetorical theory addressed three recognized genres of speeches: thejudicial (speeches in court), the deliberative (mainly, political speeches),and the laudatory. From the beginning, in the 5th century B.C.,however, the emphasis had lain heavily on the judicial genre, andthis remained the case throughout antiquity. In the Rhetoric for Herennius,the rules for the ‘invention’ for this type take up most of the firsttwo books, those for the other two types together just over a thirdof the third book; similar proportions obtain elsewhere. Moreover,the standard ‘parts of a speech’ that were generally so important(see § 4) were most appropriate for a court speech. More wide-ranging discussions were apparently rare, and restricted to eminentrhetoricians such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Claims for such widerinterests on the part of the rhetoricians in general have been made(modern and/or ancient), but on closer inspection these mostly proveuntenable (see again § 4). For instance, they did not discuss the writ-G. Achard, “Les rhéteurs sous la République: des hommes sous surveillance?,” Ktema14 (1989) [1993]: 181–188, that rhetoricians in Rome were under constraint, andwere ‘comme interdits de rédaction de manuels’ (ibid.: 187), is based on numerousmisreadings of De or., which is supposed to show that nobles generally taught eachother (e.g., on p. 186, Antonius is said seriously to proclaim himself a magisterin2.28); and on other misunderstandings (e.g., on p. 181, the praise of the rhetor inTop.2–3 is likewise taken seriously; the claim on p. 187 that grammarians who alsotaught rhetoric never wroteon the latter is contradicted by Suet. DGR4.4). Similar,partly gravely anachronistic misapprehensions are at the basis of the remarks of T. N. Habinek, The Politics of Latin Literature(Princeton: Princeton University Press1998): 108–109.36If this picture is correct, then a number of approaches must be rejected, e.g.:(1) the notion that references to rules and handbooks are irrelevant to rhetoriciansin Rome (Achard, see previous note); (2) the interpretation of De or.as a ‘Streitschriftgegen die latini rhetores,’ as E. Norden took it in his Die antike Kunstprosa vom VI. Jh.v. Chr. bis in die Zeit der Renaissance(Leipzig: Teubner 1898): 222–225 (although helater, in the Nachträge of 1909/1915, with characteristic frankness admitted thatthis was one-sided); some recent scholars return to this idea, inadequately deduc-ing the importance of the rhetores Latini to De or.from the dramatic date of the work(cf. below, 377); this approach, e.g., in T. P. Wiseman, “Practice and Theory inRoman Historiography,” History66 (1981): 380, à proposhistoriography; and in hiswake R. W. Cape, “Persuasive History: Roman Rhetoric and Historiography,” inRoman Eloquence. Rhetoric in Society and Literature, edited by W. J. Dominik (London –New York: Routledge 1997): 219–221; (3) interpretations of De oratoreas the Romananswer to the Greek handbooks (e.g., Cape l.c.).348 MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 348"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"ing of history, and an over-arching ‘epideictic’ genre covering vir-tually all prose (or even poetry and prose) did not exist. Also, atleast in Cicero’s day, the so-called theses(‘general questions’ of aphilosophical or semi-philosophical nature), though claimed by therhetoricians, were not actually discussed by them. Cicero’s low intel-lectual estimate of the rhetoricians’ activities was not totally unjustified.The status, social and intellectual, of the grammarians (grammatici,grammatiko¤) is a more complicated matter. Roughly speaking, theyoperated on two intellectual levels. In the first place, they taughtchildren between the age of, say, seven and their mid-teens. Asdescribed above, the level of this teaching ranged from teaching chil-dren their ABC’s to the explanation of poets, and often some train-ing in rhetoric. In the second place, they engaged in literary and(to some extent) linguistic scholarship of the kind particularly asso-ciated with the great centers of learning in the hellenistic period,Alexandria and Pergamum.Socially, the former activity ranked low, again in line with thegeneral status of teachers (above). No stigma, however, was attachedto the latter; on the contrary: scholarship could be a gentleman’spursuit, and was fit for upper class Romans. This can be illustratedby the example of Lucius Aelius of Lanuvium (later known as L. Aelius Stilo Praeconinus), mentioned in De oratoreby Crassus, whodescribes grammar as ‘the studies made so popular by Aelius’ (1.193:haec Aeliana studia). Aelius did not teach professionally, but only inthe time-honored Roman way of mentoring young friends, such asCicero and Varro, and at some point he acquired the status of aRoman knight. Even if this was not because of his scholarship, beinga scholarly grammarian was obviously not thought incompatible withthis status.37Yet the social picture as a whole was complicated, because manyGreek grammarians in Rome were active on both fronts, as teach-ers and (if they managed) as scholars. The former activity tended toplace them below the rhetoricians (though above the bread-and-butter teachers of letters), the latter above them. Scholarly distinction37On Aelius, see Kaster (1995) on Suet. DGR3.1–2. Kaster (p. 68) points outthat Aelius and his son-in-law, Servius Clodius, as Roman knights and ‘gentlemen-scholars,’ are omitted by Suetonius ‘from the catalogue of professoresproperly socalled’ (Suet. chapters 5–24).      349MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 349"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"tended to lessen social constraints, as the case of Tyrannio of Amisusillustrates—an extreme case, because he was a very distinguishedscholar. He had been taken prisoner in the war in the East againstMithradates around 70 B.C., but had been quickly manumitted. InMarch 56 B.C. we find him in Cicero’s house as the private teacherof Cicero’s nephew Quintus, but he was clearly fairly independent,for near the end of 54 Cicero writes to his brother that Tyranniowas reluctant to honor Cicero’s request for help with books. Heseems to have become rich, so it does seem that he taught for (con-siderable) fees, but his fame probably allowed him to be selective inaccepting pupils. Comparable cases are the scholar Alexander Polyhistorand the learned Parthenius, poet and author of the Erotika Pathemata,both also taken prisoner in the Mithradatic wars. If they taught, itwas probably as a sideline, their other activities and status makingit unnecessary.38Because they were not Roman and did not teachpublicly, the likes of Tyrannio are not mentioned in Suetonius’ Degrammaticis et rhetoribus(‘On grammarians and rhetoricians’), as thiswork only discusses those who were Roman public teachers. Butapart from that Suetonius, despite the dearth of material he had towork with, seems to give a fairly good picture of the great varia-tions in the grammarians’ social and intellectual status in the 1stcentury B.C. (and beyond).39From his work we can deduce, forinstance, that Lucius Ateius, a freedman who was born in Athens,seems to have ascended the social and intellectual scale. For Suetoniusreports that the senator-historian Asinius Pollio wrote that Ateius wasfirst ‘a Latin grammarian, thereafter an auditor and teacher ofdeclaimers’ (i.e., he taught rhetoric), ‘and as the crowning touch,38For the prisoners of the Mithradatic wars, see Rawson (1985): 8–9. For Tyrannio,see esp. J.

Q. fr.2.4.2 and 3.5.6; there is no real evidencefor the nature of his teaching (my suggestion of selectivity draws on Suetonius’report about Caecilius Epirota: DGR16.2). On Alexander, captured in the 80’s, seeChristes (1979): 38–42. Parthenius was probably captured in 73 B.C. and subse-quently brought to Rome by the father of Cinna the poet; on his life see now the(over-cautious) discussion by J. L.

The least fortunate or gifted must haveonly just eked out a living this way, and some will have sunk to thelevel of a teacher of letters; but all such men are of course anony-mous to us, as they were already to Suetonius.As to the nature of the grammarians’ scholarly activity, this stood,as already mentioned, mainly in the tradition of Alexandria andPergamum. The main focus in these centers in the 3rd and 2ndcentury was the explanation of poetry and other literature. Systematicstudy of language was generally ancillary to that, although there ismuch scholarly debate as to how far the Alexandrians in particularnevertheless took this. However that may be (see below), the liter-ary element certainly loomed large in the scholarship of the gram-marians of Cicero’s day. Much of this literary scholarship wasantiquarian in nature, i.e., it investigated historical (and supposedlyhistorical) realiaand facts mentioned in the literary texts. In the pas-sage from De oratorewhere Crassus talks about ‘the studies made sopopular by Aelius’ (above), he mentions ‘ancient, archaic words’ and‘our ancestors’ customs and their way of life’ as being among thesubjects discussed (1.193: verborum vetustas prisca...maiorum consuetudinemvitamque).41These antiquarian activities are relevant here partly because Cicero’smature rhetorical works frequently betray the feeling of intellectualexcitement that the antiquarian discoveries evoked in him and in hiscontemporaries. Crassus in De oratore3.197, having mentioned theancestral custom of ‘the lyre- and the flute-playing at ritual ban-quets’ and ‘the verses of the Salii,’ and then briefly ancient Greekmusical practice, exclaims: ‘I only wish you had preferred a discus-sion on this topic and other such questions rather than on these40Suet. DGR10.2 de eodem Asinius Pollio, in libro quo Sallusti scripta reprehendit ut nimiapriscorum verborum adfectatione oblita, ita tradit: ‘in eam rem adiutorium ei fecit maxime quidamAteius, praetextatis nobis grammaticus Latinus, declamantium deinde auditor atque praeceptor, adsummam Philologus ab semet nominatus.’In the last clause, ad summammust I think beinterpreted as indicating a next stage, see the two previous temporal indicators (cf.OLDs.v. summa8b; thence my ‘as the crowning touch’). Kaster (1995): 15, 142takes ad summamas ‘in short’ (cf. OLDibid. 7c), which fits the context less well.41For antiquarianism and its popularity see Rawson (1985): 233–249.      351MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 351"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"childish problems of metaphors!’ (quibus utinam similibusque de rebus dis-putari quam de puerilibus his verborum translationibus maluissetis!). Antiquarianscholarship is even central to the Brutus. Though the main thrust ofthis work, a history of Roman oratory, is directed against the Atticists,shortly after the beginning (13–20) Cicero also indicates that one ofthe important factors that inspired him to write it was Atticus’ recentLiber annalis. This book, in the tradition of the famous Greek scholarApollodorus of Athens (2nd century B.C.), set out Roman history ina chronological arrangement, dating events, laws, and wars by con-sular years. (Nepos, somewhat earlier, and Varro, somewhat later,also published chronographical works.) The availability of this infor-mation enabled Cicero to present the Roman orators in a (roughly)chronological sequence.42But in addition to the antiquarian aspect, Cicero’s time also wit-nessed a growing interest in the more purely linguistic side of ‘gram-mar,’ as is illustrated by Caesar’s (mostly lost) De analogiaof the latefifties, dedicated to Cicero, and, of course, by Varro’s 25 books Delingua Latina, written in the forties and (except for books 2–4) like-wise dedicated to Cicero. The history of this linguistic aspect isdifficult and contested. As mentioned above, scholars disagree as tothe nature of the Alexandrians’ involvement with language for itsown sake. It was once customary to ascribe to them the first sys-tematic accounts of (Greek) declension and inflection, but this viewis now most often rejected. They probably did have a fairly exten-sive technical apparatus concerning word classes, as well as criteriafor comparing inflected forms, but no independent, full-blown theo-ries of word classes and flexion; such systematization seems to havebegun in the 1st century B.C.43In the context of flexion (and deriva-42See also Brut.42, 44, 72, 74; Orat.120; Nepos Att.18.1–2; Hann.13.1; F.

Asto the role of language study, D. M. Schenkeveld’s position (adopted here) seemsconvincing. See esp. his “Scholarship and Grammar,” in La philologie grecque à l’époquehellénistique et romaine, ed. F. Montanari (EntretiensXL; Genève: Fondation Hardt1994): 273–292 (with further bibliography). D. J. Taylor, in his valuable survey of1986, is quite radical, and rejects the ascription to the Alexandrians of ‘everything352 MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 352"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"tion), modern scholarship used to attach much weight to the ancientconcept of analogy—roughly speaking, the notion that language is(or should be) regular, and that word formation therefore conformsto regular patterns (for example, in English, plural forms are gen-erally produced by adding an sto the singular). A polemic was sup-posed to have raged between the Alexandrians, as proponents of thisdoctrine, and Crates and his fellow scholars from Pergamum, asbelievers in the opposing concept of anomaly (the latter would stress,for example, that the plural of toothis not toothsbut teeth). It hasbecome clear, however, that even if there was such a polemic betweenanalogy and anomaly at all (which some scholars deny), its impor-tance was very restricted. Caesar’s De analogia, for instance, almostcertainly derived its title from its broad subject matter, not from astrong ‘analogistic’ stance on Caesar’s part; he took a moderate mid-dle position, as Cicero later did in Orator(152–162).44It is of some importance to note that all this concerns the levelof individual words: syntax was barely developed. Grammarians beforeApollonius Dyscolus (2nd century A.D.) rarely discussed it at all, andeven the latter did not offer a systematic account. The Stoics didpay attention to syntactical questions, but in the context of logic.And the rhetoricians mainly restricted themselves in this respect todiscussion of solecisms, i.e., certain syntactical mistakes (concerninggrammatical agreement).45If we turn to what Cicero has to say about the linguistic side ofgrammar, the first thing to note is that in De oratore, he treats thetraining by the grammarian as self-evident. In the matter of wordchoice, he sets greater store by developing one’s proficiency by read-ing orators and poets. But even that he regards as easy and notworth extensive comment (cf. 3.38, 39, 42, 48). A good case wasmade by Hendrickson for thinking that this attitude provoked Caesarmentioned about rules for declension, inflection, paradigms, and so forth,’ andlocates the emergence of a new, autonomous ‘language science’ in the first half ofthe 1st century B.C.: “Rethinking the History of Language Science in ClassicalAntiquity,” Historiographia Linguistica13 (1986): 182–188 (quotation p. 186).44For analogy vs. anomaly see again Schenkeveld (1994): 281–291; and Taylor(1986): 180–182. For the not dissimilar positions of Caesar and Cicero see Douglas(1966): 185–186 (although he still accepts the importance of the debate over analogy-anomaly as such).45See the survey in Schenkeveld (1994): 293–298. Note, e.g., that Cicero’s dis-cussion of periodic sentence structure in De or.3.173–198 concerns questions ofrhythm, not of syntax.

In writingabout it at a theoretical level, Caesar consciously elevated the sub-ject from the lower aspect of grammatical activities, that of teach-ing, to the higher, that of scholarship.46Cicero then returned to suchmatters in his brief discussion of analogy in Orator(152–162).The nature of the grammarians’ activities is especially importantfor the reconstruction of the debates surrounding Atticism (see below,§ 6). As to Cicero himself, the ideas and position of the rhetoricianswere obviously more directly relevant; but the contemporary voguefor ‘grammar,’ in all its forms, did leave very marked traces in hisrhetorical works.4.Rhetorical theoryMost upper class Roman males, just like their Greek counterparts,received rhetorical education, and as signalled above (347), the ele-ments of the standard rhetorical theories were therefore widely famil-iar. This section aims to provide a very brief overview, in particularof those features that are relevant for understanding Cicero’s works.4746De analogiaas an answer to Cicero: pp. 110–116 of G. L.

This system, that is, focused not somuch on the process of constructing a speech, but rather on thequestion of what the final product ought to look like; in other words,it offered no production rules, but product-centered ones. Variationsin the number of parts and in terminology were numerous from thebeginning, and we already find Plato making fun of some of theover-subtle technicalities (Phaedrus266D–267D). The basic contoursof the system, which remained in existence throughout antiquity,were nevertheless fairly stable. A minimum of four parts was alwaysrecognized: (1) the prologue (principium, exordium); (2) the narration(narratio), in which the (alleged) facts were to be set out, for exam-ple, the events surrounding a murder and the movements of theaccused (note that the presence of this part shows that the systemoriginally concerned judicial speeches; cf. 348 above); (3) the argu-mentation (argumentatio), usually subdivided into proof of one’s ownpoints and refutation of the opponent’s; (4) the epilogue (conclusio,peroratio). A particularly frequent addition was that of a digression toprecede the epilogue.The detailed rules for some of these parts are (and were) amongthe best-known features of rhetoric, and likewise continued to beused throughout antiquity. The prologue had to render the audiencewell-disposed, attentive, and receptive (benevolos, attentos, dociles facere).The narration had to be brief, clear, and plausible (brevis, dilucida,veri similis). And the epilogue was supposed to sum up the case andarouse the emotions of the audience. Typically, lists of set rules andHandbuch der Altertumswissenschaft II.3 (München: Beck 1974). Both S. F.

N. Gaines, “On the Rhetorical Significance of P. Hamb.131,”Rhetorica7 (1989): 335–337; an essential problem in his account is that he deducesthe existence of a so-called ‘conjunctive’ type from a faulty (because partial) analy-sis of Part. or.and from the equally untypical Martianus Capella.

It was organized accord-ing to what I shall call the ‘activities of the orator,’ the stages throughwhich an orator was supposed to go in composing and delivering aspeech.50By Cicero’s time, the standard set consisted of five activi-ties: invention (inventio; thinking out the material), arrangement (dis-positio; the subsequent ordering of this material), style (elocutio; puttingit into words), memory (memoria; memorizing the speech), and deliv-ery (actio, pronuntiatio).This system of activities had two sub-variants, for it incorporatedthe older system of the parts of a speech in one of two differentways. The first is found in Aristotle, who may not actually havethought in terms of activities himself, but whose Rhetoricdoes discussthe equivalents of invention (books 1 and 2), style and arrangement(book 3). Under ‘invention’ he discusses the ‘means of persuasion,’viz., rational arguments, persuasion through character (‘ethos’), andevoking the audience’s emotions (‘pathos’). It is under the headingof ‘arrangement’ that he discusses the parts. This is in line with thenotional content of the activities, since a discussion of the parts willinvolve questions of ordering. Although there are no further extantexamples of this subsumption of the parts under arrangement beforeCicero, there are indications that it continued in use for some time,and it was probably used by the influential 2nd century B.C. rhetori-cian Hermagoras. This is not to say that the Aristotelian approach49Cf. Rhetoric for Herennius1.14: rem narrare breviter poterimus si inde incipiemus narrareunde necesse erit; et si non ab ultimo initio repetere volumus;...(translations from this workare taken from Caplan 1954). This work employs the second kind of system, butits prescriptions for the parts of a speech are analogous to those found in the firstkind, the one based on the parts (below, 357).50The term ‘activities of the orator’ is a fairly uncommon one. However, espe-cially in a Ciceronian context it is better to avoid the traditional designation ‘partsof rhetoric,’ which emphasizes the ‘art’ of rhetoric (by which Cicero set no greatstore) at the expense of the orator (who is central to his approach). Cf.

This change—basically a contamination between the parts sys-tem and the activities system—implied that the discussion of thatactivity at least to an important extent came to be dominated bythe old, traditional rules for the parts that were mentioned above.Invention thus essentially lost its function of devising all the materialfor a speech before (under arrangement) it is ordered, and we areback at product-centered rules. This approach, apparently, graduallyousted the other variant; Cicero’s youthful De inventioneand the anony-mous Rhetoric for Herennius(both from the 80’s B.C.) are the earliestextant examples, and it is this version of the activities system thatwe also find elsewhere.The main exception is Cicero himself, who in De oratorerejectedthe rigidity of the rules for the parts of a speech, as well as the con-taminated variant of the activities system. He went back to Aristotle,discussing the parts under arrangement, and even organizing inven-tion according to the three Aristotelian means of persuasion argu-ments, ethos, and pathos. (For a more detailed discussion see Chapter12, 384–387.)One way or another, then, the parts of a speech remained oneof the staples of standard rhetoric. Another was the so-called statustheory, which, developed by Hermagoras in the mid-2nd centuryB.C., quickly came to dominate the theory of invention (apart fromthe parts of a speech). It was an elaborate system for determiningthe central matter at issue in a speech—too elaborate, according toCicero (see esp. De or.2.132; 3.70), and we can therefore omit ithere, even though it continued to play a central role in later rhetor-ical theory.5151See Matthes (1958); Caplan (1954): xlvii; G. A.

One of the ways of organizing this was to use the ‘qual-ities’ or ‘virtues’ of style—features that every speech should have.This is the approach used by Cicero in De oratore(cf. 3.37, 53, 91,144), and it also occurs in the discussion in Orator(at 79). Again,there were numerous variants, but Cicero uses Theophrastus’ origi-nal foursome: correct use of Latin (in Theophrastus’ version, ofcourse, Greek), clarity, distinction (ornatus, kÒsmow, kataskeuÆ—oftentranslated as ‘embellishment’), and appropriateness.The other main way of treating style, possibly also going back toTheophrastus, was to distinguish a number of acceptable ‘types ofstyle.’ Rhetoric for Herennius4.11–16 offers the well-known and prob-ably original variant with three such types, the plain style, the mid-dle, and the grand (plus three corresponding faulty styles, the meager,the slack, and the swollen). We find Cicero switching to this approachin his Orator, a work dominated by his dispute with the Atticists. Itenables him to cast this dispute in clear terms: the Atticists are adher-ents of the plain style, while the ideal orator is a master of all three.In arguing for this ideal (and in thus claiming that his own effortsare superior to those of his opponents), he links the three styles towhat he calls the three officia oratoris(‘tasks (or functions) of an ora-tor’): probare(‘to prove’), delectare(‘to charm, please’), and flectere(‘toinfluence’). The plain style is suitable for proving, the middle stylefor pleasing the audience, and the grand style for (emotionally)influencing them; so all three styles, he argues, are essential to oratory.These three tasks (which he had already used in the Brutus) areoften identified with the three Aristotelian means of persuasionemployed in De oratore, arguments, ethos, and pathos. But althoughthese threefold divisions are similar, they are not identical. The for-mer belongs to the analysis of style or to the evaluation of the per-formance, as a whole, of individual orators; the latter is primarilyconcerned with content. The difference between ethos and delectareis particularly clear: pleasing the audience may indeed contribute tothe positive image of the orator’s character (ethos), but there aremany more ways of conjuring up such a positive image—some ofwhich may even require the avoidance of stylistic pleasure, for instanceif the orator aims to project himself as an upright, authoritativefigure. Nevertheless, the similarity between the two threefold divi-sions (and the apparent lack of antecedents for the ‘tasks’) makes it358 MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 358"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"probable that Cicero himself developed the later, stylistic one out ofthe Aristotelian one.52The doctrine of the three styles, like the whole of ancient rhetoric,had been devised for teaching people how to compose speeches, notfor rhetorical criticism. It was nevertheless well suited for the latter,as Cicero’s use of it against the Atticists in Oratorshows. The sameis true of the overall system of the activities of the orator, and wefind numerous references to them (more or less isolated or as partof a set) in the Brutus, where Cicero gives judgments on the oratorshe discusses.53The most conspicuous case is the passage where hediscusses his mentor Antonius in terms of the five activities, startingwith his three strongest points (139: invention, arrangement, mem-ory) and continuing with the two slightly weaker ones (140–142: styleand delivery).Up to this point, this section has attempted to sketch the mainelements of the ‘core’ of rhetorical theory around Cicero’s time.Before setting out this core, however, rhetoricians in their handbooksoften discussed preliminary matters. These provide a convenient han-dle for the question whether the rhetoricians indeed treated someareas that have been claimed for them.It was customary to begin by dividing rhetorical material into twocategories: general and specific questions (thesesand hypotheses). Thelatter concerned specific events involving specific persons and cir-cumstances. An example is a judicial case about a murder, where itis asked whether X killed Y; that is, the hypothesesincluded the casestypically covered by rhetorical theory. The theseswere questions ofa philosophical or semi-philosophical nature, like ‘Should one marry?,’‘What is wisdom?,’ and ‘What is the size of the sun?.’ By also sub-suming these under rhetorical matter, the rhetoricians laid claim topart of the territory of the philosophers (cf. § 5). At least up to52See A. E. Douglas, “A Ciceronian Contribution to Rhetorical Theory,” Eranos55 (1957): 18–26, who, however, simply identifies the two divisions.

Now the ancient evidence shows that thethird of these, for which ‘epideictic’ was one of the current Greekterms, was indeed firmly defined as consisting of speeches of praise(and their negative counterparts, speeches of blame). Neverthelessscholars fairly often claim that rhetoricians expanded epideictic intoan over-arching genre covering virtually all prose (or even poetryand prose) outside the judicial and deliberative areas. But only inHermogenes (born c.161 A.D.) do we find such an encompassinggenre, called ‘panegyric,’ and he may well be the inventor. Rhetoricians,apart from a few more distinguished ones such as Dionysius ofHalicarnassus, limited their discussions to the accepted three genres,with, as remarked already, an emphasis on the judicial.5554See M. L. Clarke, “The Thesis in the Roman Rhetorical Schools of theRepublic,” Classical Quarterly45 [N.S. 1] (1951): 159–66, who convincingly arguesagainst the (still common) view that the theseswere a regular part of standard rhetoric(this view, e.g., in Bonner [1977]: 270–272—above n. 33—; it is also implicit inKaster [1995]: 282). His arguments focus on rhetorical education in RepublicanRome, but apply equally to the Greek rhetoricians of the period, as esp. De or.makes clear (1.85, 86; 2.65–66, 78; 3.107, 110, 120–121; see also Q. fr.3.3.4).Clarke thus shows that Seneca the Elder (Contr.1.pr.12), Quintilian (2.1.9; 2.4.41–42),and Suetonius (DGR25.4) are mistaken in thinking that in the old days, theseswerepart of the regular exercises. Later rhetoricians did incorporate the theses; see theabundant material in H. Throm, Die Thesis. Ein Beitrag zu ihrer Entstehung und Geschichte.Rhetorische Studien 17 (Paderborn: Schöningh 1932). Although Throm’s book con-tains much of value, the history of the problem as a whole stands in need of a re-examination.55For the standard approach, with the third genre being the laudatory, see, e.g.,Cic.

There is actually clear evidencefrom Cicero that at least in his time, they did not cover it at all—again despite claims in modern scholarship. In the second book ofDe oratore, Cicero makes his interlocutor Antonius explicitly say that‘I don’t find that the rhetoricians have anywhere furnished it withrules of its own’ (De or.2.62: neque eam reperio usquam separatim instruc-tam rhetorum praeceptis; thus 64). Antonius does say that history is agreat task for the orator (2.62, cf. 51), but that by no means impliesthat it is a task for rhetorical theory. On the contrary, his point isthat for an orator who is a master of the judicial genre, which heconsiders the most difficult, no further instruction is necessary, what-ever other task he may take up—such as history. Therefore, Antoniusis arguing, it is only natural that rhetorical theory does not cater forsuch other tasks.565.The quarrel between rhetoricians and philosophersOne of the problems that occupied Cicero throughout his life wasthe relationship between oratory and philosophy. He addresses italready in the preface to his early De inventione(1.1–5), where heposits an original unity of eloquence and wisdom; the latter is implic-itly equated with philosophy, which is seen primarily as a moralforce that should keep the powers of eloquence in check. He didnot yet envisage a farther-reaching synthesis of the two, however,for not much later in the same work he insists that the activities ofthe orator and the philosopher ought to be kept apart (1.8).57The56Antonius, that is, is not ‘complaining’ about the lack of rhetorical instructionfor history, as T. P. Wiseman, Clio’s Cosmetics. Three Studies in Greco-Roman Literature(Leicester: Leicester University Press 1979): 31, holds (cf. A. J. Woodman, Rhetoricin Classical Historiography[London – Sydney: Croom Helm, Portland OR: AreopagiticaPress 1988]: 82, 104–105). Neither is he arguing for ‘rhetorical historiography,’ aswas claimed, e.g., by Kennedy (1972): 207, 292. The latter point is now often takenfor granted on the basis of esp. Woodman’s book; see, e.g., Cape (1997), thoughhe (largely unsuccessfully) modifies some of Woodman’s analysis (cf. also above n. 36). Antonius’ remarks should be analyzed in the context of his whole argumentin 2.41–73: see Leeman-Pinkster-Nelson (1985): 248–252; J. Wisse, A. D. Leeman,“Rhetoric, Truth and History.

Cicero had particular reasons to be inter-ested in these issues: his enduring fascination with philosophy andhis conviction that his philosophical schooling was one of the mainfactors behind his success as an orator. At the same time, however,his interest reflects the contemporary disciplinary quarrel betweenthe rhetoricians and the philosophers.Although the germs of this disciplinary conflict can be seen ear-lier, it was Plato who was generally considered as primarily respon-sible for launching the main arguments against rhetoric and oratory(De or.1.47; cf. Orator12, 42)—as he often is today. Some scholarshave actually interpreted Cicero’s views as an answer to Plato’s stric-tures on rhetoric,58but such a reduction of the quarrel to the ‘greatnames’ is historically inadequate. It is in fact most often recognizedthat, probably after a period of relative ‘peace’ in the 3rd and early2nd century B.C., lively debates between philosophers and rhetori-cians ensued around 150 B.C.—perhaps partly because of the appear-ance of the Romans on the Greek ‘educational market.’ Hermagorasof Temnos, whose influential status theory apparently brought newvigor to rhetoric, may have played an important part on the rhetor-ical side; he incorporated certain types of thesesin his system, thusat the least implicitly claiming philosophical territory (cf. 359–360).The heads of three of the four leading philosophical schools almostcertainly took part in the quarrel at that stage: Carneades theAcademic, Critolaus the Peripatetic, and Diogenes the Stoic (themembers of the embassy in 156/155 B.C.: above, 338–339). Cicero’sown De oratoreis then our main testimony for the continued involve-ment of all three schools until c.100 B.C. Especially relevant arethe passages where the two chief interlocutors, Crassus and Antonius,are said to have heard debates in Athens, in 110 and 102, in whichphilosophers attacked rhetoric and oratory (1.45–47, 82–93);59amongwith philosophy partly follows from the topicality of the moral issue in the con-temporary disciplinary debate between rhetoricians and philosophers (cf. De or.1.35–40 with 1.45; cf. Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse [1996]: 215–216).58E.g., L. P. Wilkinson, in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature. II. LatinLiterature, edited by E. J. Kenney, W. V. Clausen (Cambridge: Cambridge UniversityPress 1982): 257–259; B. Vickers, In Defence of Rhetoric(Oxford: Clarendon Press1988): 163–167. Both accounts are actually unsatisfactory as a whole.59About these debates, see 390. See also 1.43, 45, 75, 104–105.

Somewhat later even the Epicureans,generally opposed to all forms of culture, debated similar issues withintheir school, as is shown by Philodemus’ work On Rhetoric, of uncer-tain date (between c.70 and 40 B.C.); the latter also attacked therhetoricians.60Some other evidence suggests that the quarrel thenended c.40 B.C. (at least for the time being: a new phase emergedin the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D.). Cicero’s mature works, that is,belong to the end of this phase of the quarrel.61An enigmatic position was taken by Philo of Larissa, who washead of the Academy (the last one) from 110/09 B.C. until his deathin 84/3. Sometime before 91 B.C., he introduced rhetoric into theAcademy (De or.3.110; Tusc.2.9), and since he numbered Ciceroamong his listeners when he lectured in Rome in 88 B.C., he maywell have influenced the synthesis of philosophy and oratory in Deoratore. The extent to which this may be the case is very briefly dis-cussed below, in the chapter on this work, as are the issues on whichthe debates in the quarrel concentrated (391–397).Readers may have noticed that I do not refer to the quarrel asbeing between rhetoric and philosophy, but as one between rhetori-cians and philosophers. The former designation, which is not infre-quently found, seems too suggestive of a conflict inherent in thedisciplines, which is therefore essentially static. As the interpretationof De oratorewill illustrate, however, the issues debated in Cicero’sday were similar but certainly not identical to those brought up byPlato. In any period, the nature of the quarrel was defined by therhetoricians and the philosophers of that particular time. I have like-wise avoided the fairly common suggestion that Cicero offered a syn-thesis of ‘rhetoric’ and philosophy, in view of his attitude towardsbarely do more than mention names: Quint. 2.15.19, 2.15.23 (perhaps: Athenaeus?),2.17.15; Sext. Emp., Adv. Rhet. 20–43, 61; Philodemus (see Ariston the Younger fr.3–5 Wehrli [vol. X]: Philod. Rhet.ed. Sudhaus I pp. 328–329 fr. XII; p. 360 col.LXXI; II pp. 197–198 fr. IV).60The prime mover in the debates within the Epicurean school seems to havebeen Zeno of Sidon (born c.150, died in the 70’s), Philodemus’ venerated teacher.For the uncertainty about the date of Philodemus’ treatise see my article “ThePresence of Zeno.

A passage not long after the beginning of Oratoreven repeats the lament of De oratoreabout the separation of the dis-ciplines of speaking and thinking (Orat.11–17). Cicero, then, hadnot changed his mind, and remained convinced of the value of phi-losophy for the orator.6.AtticismAs is well known, Cicero’s main purpose in Brutus and Orator, writ-ten in 46 B.C., is to defend himself against the so-called Atticists, agroup of youngish Romans who criticized his style as bombastic, andto establish his own approach to oratory as superior to theirs. Brutusand Oratorthemselves are discussed in separate chapters by ProfessorNarducci; here, I shall briefly treat a number of the much-discussedquestions about the ‘movement’ of Atticism itself, partly in the lightof the material of sections 2 and 3 above.63The Atticists’ criticisms of Cicero were embedded in a larger view,in that they divided the history of style into three periods: the period62For Part. or.see R.

The broader question ofthe antecedents and ‘causes’ of Atticism has not, I believe, received adequatetreatment.364 MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 364"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"of the classical Attic orators, which they idealized; the ‘hellenistic’era, which they regarded as degenerate; and the present, in whichthey themselves strove to restore the standards of the great past. The‘degenerate’ style that they rejected they called, polemically, Asiatic(as allegedly originating from Asia Minor),64and to this type, theysaid, Cicero belonged. Their own ideal was a more simple and ele-gant style of speaking, modeled on what they saw as the style of theAttic orators of the 5th and 4th centuries. Among these, they seemto have favored the ‘slender,’ elegant Lysias in particular, althoughDemosthenes must also have been among their models.65This group of Roman Atticists seems to have emerged around 60B.C. The leading figure, Calvus, had probably died in 54 or 53, butin 46 his following was obviously still considerable, provoking Ciceroto defend himself in writing. The dedicatee of both Brutusand Orator,Brutus himself, probably did not aspire to the title of Atticist, buthis ideas were close to Calvus’.It is worth noting that Calvus was a Roman aristocrat and anactive orator-politician, and that the Atticists in general clearly camefrom similar backgrounds. As stressed above (§ 3), this sets themapart from the professional rhetoricians. The debate between Ciceroand his opponents, that is, did not belong in the context of rhetor-ical schools or theory, but was one between orators who were alsointellectuals.In the many scholarly discussions of the movement, the main boneof contention is its origin, i.e., the question who started the move-ment and when. Roman Atticism is most commonly thought to havebeen descended from a Greek version, even though evidence forsuch an earlier Greek phase is lacking —the first securely dated Greekversion of Atticism being found in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, whoworked in Rome from 30/29 B.C. onwards. Broadly speaking, two64That the term was polemical, rather than historical, was pointed out by U.von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, “Asianismus und Atticismus,” Hermes35 (1900): 1–8.This is not to deny that there were common characteristics to the styles that weremost popular in the period: see C. W.

For example, Dihle has arguedthat the grammarian Philoxenus was responsible for the Roman vari-ant of Atticism (though not for the Greek variant), and recentlyO’Sullivan has made a case for the Atticist Caecilius of Caleacte—arguing that although Caecilius is known to have worked in Augustantimes, the beginning of his activity could be dated to c.60 B.C.69To me, the evidence seems to point not to a Greek origin but toCalvus himself as the originator of Atticism as such, and in that casethe movement must have been passed on to Greeks such as Dionysiusand Caecilius through a Graeco-Roman intellectual network in Rome;but this stance is bound to remain controversial.However this may be, there is also the question of antecedents—for Atticism was a fairly complex compound of ideas (the three-period-view of history, the rejection of ‘bombastic’ styles, the favoringof Lysias, etc.), and it can hardly have come out of the blue. Thereis, however, no scholarly agreement on this score either, and many66Oddly, the debate is sometimes misrepresented, esp. concerning the stance ofWilamowitz: see below n. 68.67Norden (1898), esp. 149–151. A date not long before 150 B.C. is favored, e.g.,by F. Preisshofen, “Kunsttheorie und Kunstbetrachtung,” in Le classicisme à Rome aux1ers siècles avant et après J.-C., ed. H. Flashar (EntretiensXXV; Genève: FondationHardt 1979): 263–77.68Wilamowitz (1900): 44–46, whose emphatic view that it was Greeks in Romewho ‘invented’ Atticism is sometimes distorted. According to A. Dihle, “Analogieund Attizismus,” Hermes85 (1957): 170 n. 2, Wilamowitz discussed ‘das Aufkommendes Attizismus in Griechenland’; and E. Narducci, Cicerone e l’eloquenza romana(Roma-Bari: Laterza 1997): 125, writes that the ‘followers’ of Wilamowitz see Atticism as‘un fenomeno peculiare della cultura romana,’ strongly suggesting that in this view(and in Wilamowitz’ own) no Greeks were involved.69A. Dihle, “Der Beginn des Attizismus,” Antike und Abendland23 (1977): 170–174;N. O’Sullivan, “Caecilius, the ‘Canons’ of Writers, and the Origins of Atticism,”in Dominik (ed. 1997): 32–49; O’Sullivan’s lucid article seems to make the bestpossible case for an early date of Caecilius, but the arguments remain inconclusive;other considerations still seem to me to favor the rejection of decisive Greek involve-ment at this stage (Wisse [1995]: 76–77).366 MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 366"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"candidates have been proposed as being ‘forerunners’ or otherwiseconnected with the movement.70Among the relatively undisputed facts is the prior existence of thethree-period view in other fields—a view often, usefully, called ‘clas-sicism,’ as involving a preference for a much earlier, ‘classical’ period.For instance, as early as 150 B.C., some sculptors seem to haveclaimed that they, after a period of decline, were restoring the highstandards current before 300 B.C. A further factor contributing tothe focus on the great period of Athenian history may have beenthe demise of Athenian intellectual life in our period (above, 340–341).Another fairly clear connection is with the so-called ‘neoteric’ poets,to whom both Calvus and his friend Catullus belonged; their ideasabout poetry, like the Atticists’ views on oratory, revolved aroundnotions of elegance and ‘slenderness.’ That is, these two groups ofyoung Romans partly overlapped, and used similar approaches todistinguish themselves from their predecessors.Influences of grammar have also been claimed, but this is far fromunproblematic. Some scholars, for example, have seen a role forphilological study of the classic Attic orators.71Such study suppos-edly made people aware that the Attic style was different fromCicero’s, and that Latin, in its vocabulary and syntax, tended to fos-ter a fuller and more redundant style than did Greek. This hypoth-esis is not supported by evidence, and is based on the scholarlyinclination, mentioned above (333), to privilege formal contexts overinformal ones such as private reading. Moreover, it presupposes agrammatical apparatus that is more sophisticated than was actuallyavailable. As already mentioned, theories of syntax hardly existed(353). Comparisons between the two languages were of course fre-quent, usually revolving around the question whether Latin was‘poorer’ than Greek; but they concerned vocabulary, especially philo-sophical and other technical vocabulary, and did not (yet) involvesyntactical notions.7270See the survey in Narducci (1997): 125–126 (with the reservation above n. 68).71Weische (1972): 179 (cf. 183), further developed by Narducci (1997): 126.72On the comparisons see in general J. Kaimio, The Romans and the Greek Language(Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica 1979): 262–266; and now T. Fögen, Patriisermonis egestas. Einstellungen lateinischer Autoren zu ihrer Muttersprache(München – Leipzig:Saur 2000). For the concentration on vocabulary see, e.g., Cic. Fin.3.5 verborumcopia(‘richness of words,’ i.e., vocabulary), and the famous lines Lucr. 1.136–139;and Fögen, passim, esp. his summary 228–229. Later, Quintilian did to some extentuse syntactical notions in his comparison (Fögen 143–151, 229–230).      367MAY_f12_331-374 7/11/02 8:54 PM Page 367"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"A more influential hypothesis involving grammar makes the doc-trine of analogy central to the Atticists’ concerns (cf. above, 352–353).73One of the mainstays of this idea is the connection between theAtticist movement and Caesar, who wrote De analogia, at least partlyin reaction to Cicero (above n. 46). This connection, however, isextremely doubtful, and the positions of Caesar and Cicero were notvery far apart on the issue of analogy.74More generally, the impor-tance of analogy has been much overstressed (above, 352–353). Itseems, then, that Atticism was primarily concerned not with gram-mar, but with style.Other suggestions have also been made, but these cannot be dis-cussed here. The debate about Atticism, so central to Cicero’s con-cerns in his later life, is bound to continue.7.Final remarksAlthough the previous sections have treated a number of areas sep-arately, it will be evident that there are many connections betweenthem. For example, the view of Greeks as impractical, theoreticaljabberers (§ 2) is relevant to Cicero’s picture of the rhetoricians (§ 3),because many of them were Greeks. There are less obvious con-nections as well, and by way of illustration, I will end this chapterwith a simplified sketch of one of these. In an admitttedly somewhatspeculative way, it links an element from Cicero’s defense againstthe Atticists with the quarrel between philosophers and rhetoricians.75The fourth book of Philodemus’ On Rhetoric(above, 363) containsa passage76which stresses the diversity of the styles generally in use.This implies, he claims, that the choice of any such style is arbi-73The great influence of the hypothesis is at least partly due to Norden (1898):184–189, although Norden himself, (1898): 185 n., mentions Mommsen as a fore-runner. Its most influential modern proponent is Dihle (1957); (1977).74Doubts about the connection were, for example, already voiced by A. E.Douglas, “M. Calidius and the Atticists,” Classical Quarterly5 (1955): 245. For Caesarand Cicero on analogy see above n. 44.75The following draws on my reconstruction in “Atticists, Academics and Epicureans.Response to Robert Gaines,” in Cicéron et Philodème. La polémique en philosophie, éd. par C. Auvray-Assayas et D. Delattre (Paris: Éditions Rue d’Ulm/Presses del’École normale supérieure 2001): 273–282. The main simplification in the follow-ing is the omission of a possible reference to Atticism in De or.3.25–37a; cf. ibid.:280–281; Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996): 149–150.76On RhetoricBook IV, P.

One of the other impli-cations of this argument is that the rhetoricians’ detailed rules aboutstyle are useless. The argument, that is, can also be seen as part ofthe quarrel between philosophers and rhetoricians, and it is proba-ble (but not certain) that it was one of the Academics’ lines of attackon the latter. Philodemus, in that case, adopted it to suit his ownpurpose. But we also find a different echo of the argument in Deoratore(3.25–37a), where Cicero, with a view to clearing the way forhis own discussion of style, implicitly answers it by describing diver-sity among orators as legitimate and even welcome. And then inBrutus285 ff. we find an adapted form of this answer, now used torefute the Atticists: if there is so much legitimate diversity, Ciceroargues, even between the Attic orators, then the Atticists’ concen-tration on Lysias is too narrow.In other words, we see one argument traveling, in different guises,not just from one author to another, but also from one context toanother. This is only to be expected: Cicero and many of his con-temporaries took part in a number of different debates, and theyhad no reason to compartmentalize them.This again illustrates the complexities of Roman intellectual lifein Cicero’s time, a point emphasized throughout this chapter—per-haps too much so in the eyes of some readers. But if this emphasisis justified, we must conclude that what makes the intellectual activ-ities of the period more interesting, makes them at the same timedifficult to describe and reconstruct. Yet in some areas firm, posi-tive conclusions can be drawn, as is, I hope, illustrated above. It islikely that renewed, detailed examination of some of the evidence,and especially of Cicero’s writings themselves, will take us even fur-ther, and deepen our understanding of Cicero’s stance and purposesin his ‘rhetorical’ works.7777I would like to thank the editor, Jim May, for his help and his patience. RobertGaines and Bob Kaster helped out with some rare items in the bibliography. Notfor the first time, Nancy Laan’s feeling for consistency and clarity much improvedmy writing.

Contemporary readers,therefore, might reasonably compare it to his De inventione, writtenwhen he was about seventeen. That work, in fact, presented the kindof approach that one would normally expect of a treatise on speech-making. Though written by a young member of the Roman upperclass, it was virtually indistinguishable from the products of the pro-fessional rhetoricians, as it was no more than (the first part of ) ahandbook with a version of the standard rhetorical rules.2CiceroMAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 375"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"3See 2.2; above, 340 n. 19.376 clearly anticipated that some readers would make this comparisonand indeed expect De oratoreto offer something like the standardrules, and he was keen to correct them. For very soon after thebeginning of the prologue (1.5), he describes De oratoreas a replace-ment for ‘the sketchy and unsophisticated work’ (incohata ac rudia) ofhis youth, and stresses that it will have to be ‘worthy of my presentage and of the experience I have acquired from pleading so manymomentous cases’ (hac aetate digna et hoc usu . . ., quem ex causis quasdiximus tot tantisque consecuti sumus).The rejection of the standard approach to oratory as offered bythe rhetoricians is indeed a theme that recurs throughout the work.This is just one of the ways in which it must have surprised its con-temporary readership—a surprise that is bound to be absent for mostmodern readers, who do not share the expectations of Cicero’s con-temporaries. The brief sketch of the background in this chapter will,I hope, begin to clarify what these contemporary expectations were,and thus, if not to restore some of the surprise, at least make itunderstandable.After the section mentioning his youthful treatise, Cicero contin-ues the prologue by arguing that true eloquence is rare, because ora-tory is such a difficult enterprise, requiring wide knowledge as wellas the numerous other attributes essential for an orator (1.6–20, esp.17–18). Oratorical excellence, therefore, cannot be achieved by rely-ing on the standard rules and exercises, but only ‘by means that areof a quite different order’ (1.19: aliis quibusdam). He does not yetexplicitly state what these are, and at the end of the prologue (1.23)he announces that the work will be a dialogue involving great Romanspeakers; his views, that is, will be developed through them, in thecourse of the three separate conversations (corresponding to the threebooks of the work) that make up the dialogue.The main interlocutors in the dialogue are the two great exam-ples from Cicero’s youth, Lucius Licinius Crassus and Marcus Antonius(the first a distant relative of the—now—more famous later triumvir;the second the grandfather of Mark Antony). Crassus in particularhad taken an interest in young Cicero’s education,3and as Cicerohimself indicates in the prologues to the second and third books(2.7–9; 3.14–16), the work is a monument to his and Antonius’ mem-MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 376"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"ory. This is underlined by the dramatic date: the dialogue is situ-ated some ten days before Crassus’ death in September 91 B.C. Inthe third prologue (3.1–16), Crassus’ last, impressive appearance inthe Senate as well as his death are emotively recalled. This passagealso refers to the violent deaths of most of the other interlocutors,with Antonius dying in a ‘purge’ in 87 (3.10).The emphasis in the prologues on the real Crassus and Antonius,however, does not imply that the views expressed in the work aretheirs (or, more generally, belong in the context of the 90’s B.C.);the correspondences with Cicero’s own opinions elsewhere, in Brutusand Oratorin particular, make this clear enough. Also, one of Cicero’sletters (Ad fam.7.32.2) implies that he spoke ‘through the character’of his interlocutors—in line with the conventions of the dialoguegenre, in which such fiction generally played a large part. Actually,it is almost certain that the knowledge of the two men would nothave sufficed for formulating some of the ideas that are put intotheir mouths, despite Cicero’s claim in the second prologue that theypossessed much more knowledge than was generally believed (2.1–6).This claim is part of the literary game of De oratore; the majority ofhis readers, that is, will have interpreted the work as an expressionof Cicero’s own ideas.4These ideas, as suggested above, can be usefully compared withthe approach of the rhetoricians. The differences can roughly bebrought under two main headings, to be discussed in §§ 3 and 4.Both are reflected in the title of the work, On the Orator, which impliesa focus on the orator himself and his attributes, rather than on rules,which were at the center of the rhetoricians’ approach. In the firstplace, Cicero believes that the rhetoricians’ rules are too inflexibleto cover the difficulties of the cases facing an orator in real life.Therefore, he chooses an alternative approach to rhetorical theory,which concentrates on (and takes seriously) the stages through whichan orator will go in preparing and presenting a speech (the ‘activitiesof the orator’). In the second place, as already indicated in the first4On the dialogue, and the interplay of reality and fiction in it, see May & Wisse(2001): 13–18; Leeman-Pinkster (1981): 67–70, 86–96; Leeman-Pinkster-Nelson (1985):203–206; Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996): 283–285; also J. Hall, “Persuasive Designin Cicero’s De oratore,” Phoenix48 (1994): 210–225, who takes a different view ofCicero’s claim in 2.1–6, seeing it as a ‘rhetorical’ ploy of Cicero’s to enhance thecredibility of his views.DE ORATORE:  ,  377MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 377"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"prologue (1.6–20: above), he also regards rhetorical rules as too nar-row. Good and successful oratory requires wide-ranging knowledge,especially of philosophy; ideally speaking, the orator’s knowledgeshould actually be universal. This aspect of Cicero’s views is con-nected with the disciplinary quarrel between rhetoricians and philoso-phers, but while it clearly sets Cicero apart from the rhetoricians,we will see that it does not align him with the philosophers either.The notion of universal knowledge points to another implicationof the title of the work. For although De oratoreliterally means Onthe Orator, it in fact implies, as a number of passages make clear,that the subject is the ideal orator (e.g., 1.64, 118; 3.83–85). Idealrequirements—such as that of universal knowledge—are of courseunrealistic, but Cicero was well aware of that. One of the aims ofDe oratoreis to put the orator before the readers’ eyes in perfect form(cf. 3.85), and thus to inspire them to strive for oratorical excellencethemselves.2.Structure; the dialogueBefore the analysis, in the next two sections, of the polemics of Deoratore, a few remarks on the function of the dialogue form may beuseful, in conjunction with a brief survey of the structure of thework.5The dialogue is among the features of the work whose importanceis easily overlooked by the modern reader. After all, we are usuallyinformed about such matters beforehand, by a history of Roman lit-erature or otherwise, and are therefore liable to take them for granted.Many contemporary readers, however, must have been surprised byit. If nothing more, it sets De oratoreapart from the rhetorical man-uals, which were the traditional vehicles for writing about oratory.Instead, it links the work with Plato’s dialogues, especially those aboutrhetoric, the Gorgiasand the Phaedrus—even though this leaves opennumerous possibilities for the nature of this link (see § 4).5About the dialogue, see the references in the previous note. An attractive analy-sis of the setting is given by W. Görler, “From Athens to Tusculum: Gleaning theBackground of Cicero’s De oratore,” Rhetorica6 (1988) [1989]: 215–235. For anoverview of the structure see the synopsis in May & Wisse (2001): 42–48; sum-maries of individual books and of all individual passages, and discussions of theirstructure and function, are available in Leeman-Pinkster et al.

It is made clearfrom the start that his interlocutors had been active politicians andstatesmen; the occasion for the dialogue is said to have been a pri-vate meeting in Crassus’ villa that was called for political reasons(1.24–27). These reasons, moreover, were connected with the gravepolitical crisis that was looming at the dramatic date of September91 B.C., and which would soon lead to the war with the ItalianAllies and to civil wars. Cicero repeatedly emphasizes this crisis andits aftermath, for instance in the emotional third prologue (above).He thus suggests a parallel with the crisis at the time when he waswriting the work, when Roman politics was dominated by the triumvi-rate of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, a crisis to which he had alreadyalluded at the very beginning of the prologue (1.1–3). This politicaldimension of De oratoreis of a piece with Cicero’s view of the (ideal)orator—‘the man,’ Crassus says in a significantly long sentence,‘whom we are looking for, and whom we want to be an author ofpublic policy, a guide in governing the community, and a leaderwho employs his eloquence in formulating his thoughts in the Senate,before the people, and in public court cases’ (3.63: eo viro, quem quaeri-mus et quem auctorem publici consilii et regendae civitatis ducem et sententiaeatque eloquentiae principem in senatu, in populo, in causis publicis esse volumus).These symbolic functions of the dialogue form, the ‘anti-rhetori-cal’ and the political, are clearly important. Yet the dialogue is evenmore than a meaningful, symbolic form superimposed on what couldstill be regarded as a regular treatise. It is used by Cicero to pre-sent his views in ways that would not have been possible in a manual-like work. In the first place, he employs it to show different sides ofa problem, in that he has allocated different views to different inter-locutors. Also, it enables him, particularly by exploiting some fea-tures of real-life conversation such as repetition, to present his viewsin a more persuasive way; he could thus try to overcome the hesi-tations that some of his intended readership must have felt towardsthe important intellectual aspect of his views (above, 336–337).The first book is a case in point, both by itself and in its inter-play with the other two books. After the prologue, it continues witha brief description of the political crisis of September 91 that hadoccasioned the gathering in Crassus’ villa, and with the names ofthose present (1.24–25): Crassus and Antonius (born in 140 and 143B.C. respectively), Crassus’ aged father-in-law Scaevola (born 168/160),DE ORATORE:  ,  379MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 379"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"and the relatively young orator-politicians Sulpicius and Cotta (born124/123). Politics is said to have dominated the first day, but onthe second day Crassus started a discussion about oratory, as a means‘to relieve the minds of all from the tension of the conversation ofthe day before’ (1.29).The rest of the book consists of four parts, clearly separated bythe insertion of brief, more informal conversations between severalof those present. The first part (1.30–95) is dominated by an argu-ment advanced by Crassus: he holds that the orator, however onechooses to define him, will have to possess broad knowledge, espe-cially philosophical knowledge, and he claims that such knowledgeis therefore the property not just of the philosophers but also of theorators. Cicero indicates that the context of this claim is the quar-rel between philosophers and rhetoricians, because in this passageboth Crassus and Antonius report debates that they had in Athenswith leading philosophers, most notably the versatile AcademicCharmadas. These attacked rhetoric and oratory, and Crassus’ viewis presented as an answer to them. In the second part (1.96–159)Crassus, sometimes interrupted by the others, discusses matters likethe importance in oratory of natural ability and training. In the thirdpart (1.160–203), Crassus is then asked again to talk about the ora-tor’s knowledge, and argues for the need to master the technicalsubject of Roman civil law. Scaevola and Sulpicius seem impressed,but when Antonius then takes the floor in the fourth part (1.209–262),he rejects all of Crassus’ highminded claims: one ought not to extendthe definition of the orator unduly, and both philosophy and legalknowledge are quite unnecessary.Antonius’ intervention illustrates the use of the dialogue to showdifferent points of view. In the second book, he concedes that hedid not mean what he said (2.40), and in the climax of the third itis Crassus who has the last word about the knowledge of the ora-tor. Thus Cicero makes his own view quite clear in the end. Yetthe presence of Antonius’ counter-arguments gives the discussion adepth that would have been impossible to achieve in a straightfor-ward treatise—even though Cicero chooses not explicitly to resolvethe issue himself, but to leave that to the reader.6Of course Antonius’6A comparable case, in which readers are likewise invited to draw their ownconclusions, is the ‘contradiction’ between Antonius in 2.189–196 and Crassus in380 MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 380"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"about-face may seem an artificial move, and it has indeed been crit-icized as such. But Cicero’s ideal orator possesses the skill of argu-ing both sides of any issue (in utramque partem/sententiam dicere, e.g.3.80), and as he indicates (1.263; cf. 2.40), Antonius’ approach ismeant to show this at work.7The use of the dialogue for a persuasive presentation is illustratedby the way in which Crassus, after the different subjects of the sec-ond part of the book, is then asked to return to the theme of theorator’s knowledge in 1.160–203; this theme is thus only graduallyunfolded. More significant in this respect is the relationship betweenCrassus’ discussion of the same subject in the first part (viz., 1.45–73)and the way that he develops it again in book 3. In book 1, heargues against the philosophers on the basis of several definitions ofthe orator. While there are certainly serious undertones here, hisargument is also meant to be playfully clever in outdoing the philoso-phers at their own argumentative game.8By book 3, however, afterthe extensive preparation in book 1, the reader is clearly supposedto be more receptive to Cicero’s ideas: even though book 3 has itsown persuasive strategies, it shows the reader a more serious Crassus.After the general discussions of book 1, books 2 and 3 are partlymore technical, in that they are built around the concrete ‘activitiesof the orator’: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.As Cicero later wrote to Atticus (Att.4.16.3), he thought it unfittingthat a dignified old man like Scaevola should be present at suchtechnicalities. Accordingly, he made him leave Crassus’ villa at theend of the day described in book 1, on account of another socialcommitment. In his stead, the morning of the next day sees thearrival of two other friends, the half-brothers Caesar Strabo andCatulus. The first was known for his strikingly individual and wittyoratory, and he contributes a long discussion of oratorical humor tothe second book. The second was knowledgeable about things Greek,3.215; see J. Wisse, Ethos and Pathos from Aristotle to Cicero(Amsterdam: Hakkert 1989):198, 262–263; May & Wisse (2001): note at 3.215.7About (and against) the criticisms see Leeman-Pinkster (1981): 68, who, how-ever, concentrate only on Cicero’s own appreciation of the method of arguing bothsides, and neglect that Antonius’ approach mirrors that of the ideal orator; theyare therefore still forced to ‘excuse’ Cicero for giving both sides to the same speaker.8E.g., the argument about Plato’s Gorgias(1.47) is serious, and returns in 3.129.The partly playful character of Crassus’ mode of arguing is brought out by Scaevola’sreaction in 1.74.DE ORATORE:  ,  381MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 381"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"and is used by Cicero to comment on, and thus reinforce, pointsabout Greek culture made by Antonius or Crassus.The technical character of these books is, of course, relative. Forone thing, and even apart from the liveliness imparted by the dia-logue, book 3 contains Crassus’ long final pronouncements on therelationship between oratory and philosophy. Elsewhere in these twobooks, the discussions are set apart from those of the handbooks by,for instance, the centrality of the orator, the selective and sometimesidiosyncratic treatment of some subjects such as memory and deliv-ery,9and the polemical slant of many passages.The polemics of book 2 are put into Antonius’ mouth, and mainlyconcern the inadequacy of the standard rhetorical rules. Like thestandard manuals, Antonius’ treatment concentrates on judicial ora-tory (above, 348), but unlike them, it offers a rationale for thisapproach in a discussion of the orator’s subject matter (2.41–73;note, again, the centrality of the figure of the orator himself ). Thekey to this rationale is the principle of analogy. The judicial genre,Antonius says, is the most difficult and demanding of all possibletasks involving speech, and anyone who has mastered this genre cantherefore easily achieve success elsewhere by proceeding analogously.This applies not just to the other traditional rhetorical genres, thedeliberative and the laudatory, but also, for example, to consolation,to the writing of history, and to the exposition of philosophical mat-ters.10After this passage, Antonius adds a brief, polemical discussionof the standard rules and some thoughts about the roles of naturalability and imitation (2.74–98). It is only after all these preliminar-ies that he begins his account of how an orator ought actually toproceed in handling a judicial case, in terms of invention and arrange-ment (to be discussed in § 3); at the end (2.350–360), he adds abrief account of memory.Book 3, wholly dominated by Crassus, is devoted to style anddelivery, and indeed contains (semi)technical treatments of these mat-ters. The most important passages, however, are about the need for9On the treatment of memory (2.350–360) cf. Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996):65–68; briefly May & Wisse (2001): 37, and notes to the passage. The tone of thetreatment of delivery (3.213–227) is fairly light, particularly the discussion of theuse of the voice (216–219), which mainly consists of illustrations by quotations fromolder Latin poets.10This function of 2.41–73 is crucial for the interpretation of Cicero’s views onhistoriography: above, 361.382 MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 382"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"the orator to escape from the narrowness of rules by acquiring philo-sophical knowledge. There are three such passages (3.19–24, 52–90,104–147), and they are inserted into the discussion of style, whichmay at first sight seem odd; the subject seems more at home underinvention, which concerns content. But again the structure exactlyfits Cicero’s views: at the beginning of book 3 he makes Crassusargue, in an emphatic passage, that words and content should notbe separated (3.19–24).In book 3, then, the theme of the orator’s knowledge is discussedin several passages, not in one continuous treatment. This reflectsCicero’s remarkable, ‘rhetorical’ strategy in this book.11The climaxof the treatment of the theme is Crassus’ statement that the oratorwho possesses full philosophical knowledge surpasses everyone else(3.143), but Cicero works toward this climax only gradually and cau-tiously. A number of times the discussion of the knowledge themeseems to be brought to a close, only to re-appear later; there are,so to speak, a number of successive ‘waves’ in which the theme isdeveloped (viz., 3.19–24, 52–90, 104–125, 126–147). And in thecourse of this development the emphasis, broadly speaking, shiftsfrom a fairly restricted—but already demanding —claim that the ora-tor should master the philosophical department of ethics (whichincluded psychology and political theory), toward the ‘maximalistic’claim that the ideal orator possesses universal knowledge. Cicero, wemay conclude especially from these features of the third book, feltthat some readers would find it hard to accept his view that theconsummate orator should master the whole of philosophy, and hechose to employ techniques he also used in speeches to make a per-suasive case.3.The ‘rhetorical theory’ of De oratoreThe experience that Cicero had acquired ‘from pleading so manymomentous cases’ (1.5) had taught him that rhetorical rules as given11Cf. above, 337 with n. 11. For more detailed discussions of this strategy ofrepetition with variations, see Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996): 93–95; May & Wisse(2001): 18–19. The crucial first step towards the explanation of the repetitions inDe oratorewas taken by A. D. Leeman, “The Structure of Cicero’s De oratore I,”in Ciceroniana.

They could at best be useful as a point of refer-ence (1.145), but were generally too rigid to be of any real help incomposing an effective speech. (For a brief description of the stan-dard systems, see above, 354–361.)12Among the doctrines that come in for consistent criticism, espe-cially from Antonius in the second book, are the detailed rules forthe parts of the speech, which were central to virtually all rhetori-cal handbooks (above, 355–357). Why, Antonius asks, do they pre-scribe that in the prologue we should make the hearers ‘well disposedto us, receptive, and attentive’ (2.80: ut eum qui audiat benivolum nobisfaciamus et docilem et attentum)? Surely, he says (2.81–82), we should doso throughout our speech? These and the other rules for the partsshow that these rhetoricians are utterly impractical people—‘theyshould ask themselves what it is that they want, whether they aregoing to take up arms for sport or for battle’ (2.84: sed videant quidvelint, ad ludendumne an ad pugnandum arma sint sumpturi).What is perhaps even worse is the implication in the handbooksthat the parts should always come in the standard order: prologue,narration, argumentation, epilogue (with some possible additions, suchas digressions in between). Antonius begins his discussion of how toapproach a case by emphasizing that the orator ‘ought to acquainthimself diligently and thoroughly with each and every case he isgoing to handle’ (2.99: quascumque causas erit tractaturus, ut eas diligenterpenitusque cognoscat). Elsewhere too, he stresses that the actual case inhand must be what guides the orator. This makes rigid prescriptionslike the standard order of the parts totally inadequate. Every case isdifferent, and a speech can only be effective if it is geared to theneeds of the specific case. To achieve this, the orator needs an inte-grated persuasive strategy based on an overview of the whole of thecase, not the rigid and piecemeal approach of the standard rules.In other words, instead of the usual ‘product-centered’ rules, whichfocused on listing the features of the product (a speech), what oneneeded was a procedure for the ‘production’ of a speech—an approach,12Among the references given at 354 n. 47, F. Solmsen’s studies must again besingled out: “Aristotle and Cicero on the Orator’s Playing upon the Feelings,”Classical Philology33 (1938): 390–404; “The Aristotelian Tradition in Ancient Rhetoric,”American Journal of Philology62 (1941): 35–50; 169–90 (= id., Kleine Schriften, vol. 2[Hildesheim: Olms 1968]: 216–230 and 178–215 respectively).384 MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 384"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"that is, focusing on the orator himself. Such a set of ‘productionrules’ was, at least in principle, available in rhetorical theory, in theform of the system of the ‘activities of the orator’:13the first activ-ity, invention, involved devising the material for the speech; the sec-ond, arrangement, consisted of ordering the material; etc. (above,356–357). Yet in most handbooks of Cicero’s time even this systemhad been transformed into a set of ‘product-centered’ rules, in thatinvention was organized according to the parts of the speech (above,357). Cicero, on the contrary, while indeed adopting the system of‘activities,’ takes this approach seriously, describing the activities asstages through which an orator ought to go when composing andpresenting a speech: getting to know the case and thinking out allthe material accordingly (invention), arranging this material (arrange-ment), putting it into words (style), memorizing the speech (mem-ory), and delivering it (delivery).This principle of successive stages is most essential when it comesto distinguishing between invention and arrangement; after all, orga-nizing invention according to the parts, as most handbooks did, ina sense amounts to a contamination of these two. And indeed, theaccount of invention in De oratore(2.99–306) avoids this contamina-tion. It shows no trace of the parts, but concerns devising allthematerial for a speech. It is subdivided into three categories: argu-ments, ethos, and pathos. Ethos and pathos are non-argumentative,the first being concerned with the character of the speaker (or hisclient or his opponent(s)), the second with playing upon the feelingsof the audience.The division of invention into the three ‘means of persuasion’arguments, ethos, and pathos goes back to Aristotle’s Rhetoric. Unlikesome other Aristotelian concepts, however, it left virtually no tracesapart from De oratore. Cicero, in fact, had probably read the Rhetoric,even though this cannot be proved. Among the signs that he did isa passage from the second book (2.160), where he makes Antoniussay, among other things, that he read the books in which Aristotlegave his own views on rhetoric, which must refer to the Rhetoric—it is hard not to take this as an indication on Cicero’s part that hedid the same himself.1413On the use of this term, see above, 356 n. 50.14For a full discussion of Cicero’s knowledge of the Rhetoric, see Wisse (1989):DE ORATORE:  ,  385MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 385"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"This does not imply that the concepts of ethos and pathos asemployed by the two authors are identical. In Aristotle, ethos isrestricted to those character traits that will suggest to the audiencethat the speaker is trustworthy; it is not an emotional matter, becausethe audience can rationally decide whether they think that the speakeris reliable, and whether they can thus rely on what he says. Pathosincludes the evocation of all the emotions of the audience, whethermild or violent. In Cicero, ethos is broader, and is concerned with(painting an image of ) all the orator’s (positive) character traits (andthose of his client, etc.), and with securing the goodwill of the audi-ence on that basis (2.182–184). Accordingly, his concept of pathosis narrower, and includes only the arousal of strong emotions in theaudience.15The reason behind this difference, and whether Cicerowas conscious of it, cannot be known, but it is clear Cicero’s con-cepts are easier to match with his own practice. For example, hisalmost all-pervading use of his own character in his speeches is gen-erally aimed at winning the audience’s goodwill, while his ability toevoke violent emotions was one of his great strengths.16However that may be, according to Cicero’s approach the oratormust first, under invention, devise all the material for his speech,and only then arrange this material. Antonius, moreover, is quiteemphatic (cf. 2.315) that he must first do the arranging in generalterms (2.307–315), before thinking about the individual parts of thespeech (2.315–332). This approach implies maximum flexibility whendealing with a concrete case. This, combined with the total view of105–189 (partly summarized in May & Wisse [2001]: 39). Another recent treat-ment has concluded that Cicero did not consult the Rhetoric, but seems to me tobe almost entirely based on anti-Ciceronian prejudice: W. W. Fortenbaugh, “Cicero’sKnowledge of the Rhetorical Treatises of Aristotle and Theophrastus,” in Cicero’sKnowledge of the Peripatos, edited by W. W. Fortenbaugh, P. Steinmetz. RutgersUniversity Studies in Classical Humanities 4 (New Brunswick – London: TransactionPublishers 1989): 39–60.15Note that ethos in neither author includes characters other than the directparticipants in a trial (pleaders and clients), a point often neglected in modern analy-ses of speeches. For the analysis of the two concepts in this paragraph see Wisse(1989): 32–34, 236–248 (summarized in Leeman-Pinkster-Rabbie [1989]: 128 andMay & Wisse [2001]: 34–35); it was independently developed by W. W. Fortenbaugh,“Benevolentiam conciliareand animos permovere: Some Remarks on Cicero’s De oratore2.178–216,” Rhetorica6 (1988) [1989]: 259–273. Cicero, by the way, avoids tech-nicalities, and does not use the terms ‘ethos’ and ‘pathos.’16For his own evaluation of his use of pathos, see esp. Orator129–132.

A telling passage in this respect is 2.310,part of the general considerations about arranging the material forthe speech. Here Antonius again refers to the three means of per-suasion (arguments, ethos, pathos), and formulates a general princi-ple for their distribution:et quoniam, quod saepe iam dixi, tribus rebus homines ad nostram sententiam per-ducimus, aut docendo aut conciliando aut permovendo, una ex tribus his rebus resprae nobis est ferenda, ut nihil aliud nisi docere velle videamur; reliquae duae,sicuti sanguis in corporibus, sic illae in perpetuis orationibus fusae esse debebunt.nam et principia et ceterae partes orationis, de quibus paulo post pauca dicemus,habere hanc vim magno opere debent, ut ad eorum mentes, apud quos agetur, per-manare possint.Also, as I have often said already, we bring people over to our pointof view in three ways, either by instructing them or by winning theirgoodwill or by stirring their emotions. Well, one of these methods weshould openly display, and we must appear to aim at nothing but giv-ing instruction, while the other two must, just like blood in the body,flow throughout the whole of the speech. For it is essential that notonly the prologues but also the other parts of a speech, about whichI shall presently say a few words, should have the power to seep intothe minds of the audience.The implication of all this is that only on the basis of an over-arching rhetorical strategy can the orator see to it that he distrib-utes ethos and pathos throughout his speech; and only in this waycan his speech be effective in bringing over the audience to his pointof view.Although the notion of the activities as real stages in an orator’sapproach to a case is perhaps the most fundamental differencebetween De oratoreand standard rhetoric, it is by no means the onlyone. As to invention, contemporary readers must have been sur-prised by how little space is given to status theory, which formedthe backbone of many of the standard accounts. Details must beomitted here,17but the theory, specifically associated with the nameof the mid-second century rhetorician Hermagoras, amounted to asystem for classifying the possible central issues in a speech.

Crassus in 3.70).The classifications of status theory were typically used as part ofa simple strategy to find the arguments for a case: for every cate-gory the handbooks usually provided lists of standard arguments(‘commonplaces’ or ‘topics’). The second book of De inventioneis mainlydevoted to such lists; in 2.83, for instance, it is said that in a caseof the category of relatio criminis, in which the defendant blames some-one else for his crime, he will support his argument ‘by magnifyingthe culpability and audacity of the person on whom he lays theblame.’ Relying on such lists, of course, again runs counter to Cicero’sprinciple of approaching each individual case on its own merits, andhe makes Antonius stress that it is not a good idea (esp. 2.138–142).Instead, Antonius insists on using another, far more flexible method,which, as Cicero signals (2.152, 160), ultimately goes back to Aristotle,although it is unclear by what road it reached Cicero. It is basedon ‘commonplaces’ of a different, more abstract kind. One may, forinstance, look for arguments based on similarity, such as ‘If wild ani-mals love their young, what tenderness should we humans showstoward our children!’ (2.168). Such abstract argument patterns willhelp the orator find all the possible arguments himself—including allthe arguments given in the standard lists, but many more that ariseout of the material of the specific case.The most important other deviations from the contemporary rhetor-ical handbooks are to be found in the treatment of style in the thirdbook. This treatment is organized according to the principle of the‘qualities’ (sometimes called ‘virtues’) of style, i.e., the stylistic fea-tures that every speech needs to possess (cf. above, 358). Crassusenumerates four (3.37): correct use of Latin, clarity, ‘distinction’ (orna-tus),18and appropriateness. The employment of the concept of thequalities is not in itself remarkable, because this was quite wide-spread. In Cicero’s time, however, the number and nature of thequalities may have varied greatly; this at least is what the treatmentin the Rhetoric for Herennius(4.17–69) suggests. His four clear cate-gories are a return to the original foursome as devised by Aristotle’sinfluential pupil Theophrastus.18On ‘distinction’ as the translation of ornatus(Greek kÒsmow,kataskeuÆ), ratherthan ‘embellishment’, ‘ornamentation’ and the like, see May & Wisse (2001): 326.388 MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 388"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Of these qualities, the first two, correct Latin and clarity, receivea remarkably cavalier treatment, with Crassus repeatedly claimingthat they are easy (3.37–51). This attitude may well have provokedCaesar to write his De analogia(above, 353–354), but we may sup-pose that its main polemical thrust was again directed at the rhetori-cians, whose approach to these matters, it is suggested, was quiteunhelpful. Crassus takes an even poorer view of their discussions ofthe figures of style, normally a substantial part of the teachings aboutdistinction (ornatus); his account (3.202–207) is no more than a tediouslist, with numerous unclarities and obscurities, and is obviously aparody of what Cicero regarded as the overprecise, longwinded, butoften confusing treatments in the manuals.19On the constructive side, Cicero adds a discussion of prose rhythm(combined with a treatment of periodic sentence structure; 3.173–198).This subject was not discussed in standard rhetoric (3.188), but hadbeen treated by Aristotle and Theophrastus, to whom Cicero refersa number of times (3.182, 184–185, 193); he indeed suggests thathe is returning to them (3.148). Part of the passage (viz., 3.176–181)is taken up by arguments showing how useful rhythmical prose isand how easily it can be produced, and it is not impossible thatCicero is here implicitly defending his own practice. Since he emphat-ically returns to the subject in the anti-Atticist context of Orator(168–236), we may here have a sign of an early, still mild polemicagainst the Atticists.204.Eloquence and philosophyCicero’s approach as outlined in the previous section, which is pre-sented mainly by Antonius in the second book, may be character-ized as rhetorical theory, even though the concentration on ‘productionrules’ makes it fundamentally different from the basically ‘product-centered’ rules of the rhetoricians.

What the orator really needs is knowledge, andthe ideal orator possesses universal knowledge. An important areahe needs to master, highlighted in the first book, is that of Romancivil law (1.160–203: above, 380), and Antonius’ (initial) oppositionto this idea near the end of the book (1.234–255) implies that it wasfairly controversial. Yet it is the claim that the orator needs philos-ophy that was most controversial and most important to Cicero, asis shown by the length of the discussions and the ‘rhetorical’ tech-niques employed in them (above, 381, 382–383).Cicero clearly indicates that the context of this claim is the con-temporary quarrel between the philosophers and the rhetoricians (thehistorical outlines of which have been given in the previous chap-ter: 361–364). He does so, in the first book, by having both Crassusand Antonius take part in debates with philosophers on the matter.This is supposed to have happened when they were passing throughAthens on their way to or from their provinces as Roman magis-trates (1.45–47 and 57; 1.82–93). That the real Crassus and Antoniusvisited Athens should not be doubted, but whether they were actu-ally ever present at such debates is uncertain.21Yet it can be safelydeduced from these passages that there were indeed fierce contro-versies, and also, for example, that Charmadas, the energetic debaterfrom the Academy so vividly portrayed by Antonius in book 1(1.82–93), took a prominent part in them. In book 3 the quarrel islikewise central. In a crucial passage (3.56–73), Crassus insists thatit goes back to Socrates’ hostility towards eloquence, which causedwisdom and eloquence to be split apart, and he presents his pleafor a synthesis of oratory and philosophy as a plea for the restora-tion of the original unity of the two.The classic anti-rhetorical texts are of course Plato’s GorgiasandPhaedrus. It is therefore tempting to take all later contributions asanswers to Plato, and De oratoreis sometimes interpreted in this way(above, 362). Indeed, Cicero indicates that he regards Plato as themost prominent enemy of oratory, and that philosophers like Char-madas often referred to him (1.47; 3.122, 129; cf. 1.57, 87); thewhole discussion in fact begins with a reference to the beginning of21See n. 4 (with text) on fiction in the dialogue; on this particular point see May& Wisse (2001): 17–18.390 MAY_f13_375-400 7/11/02 8:55 PM Page 390"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"the Phaedrus, and ends with an allusion to its end (1.28; 3.228–230).Yet the temptation should be resisted. Plato was obviously a vener-ated authority, but that does not imply that the debates were con-ducted on Platonic terms. We may compare the philosophical debatesbetween the sceptics from the Academy and the ‘dogmatists’ fromthe Stoa in the third and second centuries B.C. The Academics,most famously Arcesilaus and Carneades, claimed that Plato, thefounder of their school, was a sceptic like themselves, so they obvi-ously set some store by his authority.22Yet their attacks on the Stoicsfocused almost exclusively on the refutation of the Stoic criterion oftruth, and cannot have been regarded, even by themselves, as directlyechoing Platonic notions. So while Plato certainly functioned as animportant symbol in the second and first century debates betweenrhetoricians and philosophers, only an analysis of the issues can showwhether his actual stance was still important. De oratoreshows thatthis was not the case.Three issues were potentially important: the question whetherrhetoric is an ‘art’ (ars, t°xnh), the moral problems connected withrhetoric, and the knowledge necessary for an orator. In Plato, thesethree were connected in a special way.23Most sophists who taughtrhetoric in his day, as well as most later rhetoricians, claimed thatrhetoric as they taught it was an ‘art,’ and this claim is Plato’s start-ing point. An art in the strict sense was a systematic body of knowl-edge that provided a reliable guide for attaining certain practicalresults—in the case of rhetoric, persuasion of the audience. If rhetoricis indeed to be an art and to offer absolutely reliable guidance, Platoargues, then the knowledge on which it is based must necessarily bereal, i.e., absolute, ‘philosophical’ knowledge. And because the prin-cipal concern of rhetoric is lawsuits, with their questions of right andwrong, this must include real knowledge of right and wrong. Thenext step in Plato’s reasoning involves the ‘Socratic paradox,’ accord-ing to which morality depends on knowledge; someone who has realknowledge of right and wrong will act on the basis of this knowledge,and his or her actions will therefore be morally right; conversely,22J. Glucker, Antiochus and the Late Academy. Hypomnemata 56 (Göttingen:Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht 1978): 31–64.23See esp. Gorgias459C–460C; Phaedrus259E–266B.

In other words,philosophical knowledge should be central to rhetoric. Without it,rhetoric is no art and is morally dangerous—and this is indeed thecase both with rhetorical theory as usually taught and with rhetor-ical practice, i.e., oratory.In Cicero, there is no trace of this intricate compound of ideas,neither positively nor negatively. Moreover, the same applies to mostphilosophers of his time, and certainly to the Academics, the mostprominent opponents of rhetoric and oratory in De oratore: they didnot connect the three issues.24These must therefore be consideredseparately, and without the automatic assumption of a Platonicbackground.The Academics as well as the other philosophers did attack therhetoricians’ rules as not constituting an ‘art’ (see, e.g., 1.90–93).25Cicero, unsurprisingly in view of his concentration on the oratorhimself and of his contempt for the rhetoricians’ systems, does notcome to their rescue. He actually makes a point of stressing howunimportant the issue is to him, by making both Crassus and Antoniussay that valuable guidelines based on experience can be given andare quite enough, and that it does not matter at all that there is norhetorical ‘art’ in the strict sense (1.102–110; 2.32).The issue of the immorality of rhetoric is often taken to be cen-tral to De oratore. In this view, Cicero’s reason for demanding thatthe orator master philosophy is that philosophy will act as a moralforce, guaranteeing that the orator will not abuse his rhetorical skills;in this respect, he is supposed to resemble Plato (above).26Cicero,24The position of the Stoics was akin to Plato’s, but significantly, Antonius dis-cards it as useless (De or.1.83), and Crassus alludes to it half-ironically (3.55). Cf.Leeman-Pinkster (1981): 132–133; Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996): 198–200.25For the debates about this issue, see H. M.

In this section, Crassusfirst describes the great power of supreme eloquence, which is basedon knowledge. He then adds that ‘the greater this power is, the morenecessary it is to join it to integrity and the highest measure of goodsense’; otherwise, he says, we ‘will put weapons in the hands of mad-men’ (quae quo maior est vis, hoc est magis probitate iungenda summaque pru-dentia; quarum virtutum expertibus si dicendi copiam tradiderimus, non eos quidemoratores effecerimus, sed furentibus quaedam arma dederimus). Since he saysthat it is ‘necessary’ to join moral qualities to eloquence, and there-fore to the knowledge on which it is based, they are obviously not,as in Plato, automatically joined to such knowledge. Elsewhere, thismatter-of-fact view of the moral issue is confirmed. It is, however,never stressed, and the question of the morality of rhetoric is in factmostly avoided—perhaps precisely because Cicero felt that there wasno way to guarantee the integrity of the orator.It is the orator’s knowledge as such, then, that is Cicero’s centralconcern in De oratore, and his reasons have nothing to do with moral-ity. They have to do with partly quite pragmatic concerns. Timeand again he stresses the importance of pathos, the emotional manip-ulation of the audience, and for this, he holds, it is essential to mas-ter psychology, which was part of ethics. For instance, in 1.60 Crassusasks: ‘can speech be applied to kindle the emotions or to quenchthem again—precisely the thing most essential for an orator—with-out having investigated with the utmost care all the theories that thephilosophers have developed about human character and behavior?’27Moreover, the orator needs to impress his audience and ‘send shiv-ers down their spines,’ and the more he knows, the more successfulEthics of Rhetoric” (in preparation).

Crassus likens him to an aedile, who has to pro-vide ‘elaborate provisions’ for his games, because it is impossible to‘satisfy our Roman people with ordinary, homebred material.’28A recurring, less pragmatic consideration is that an orator (andcertainly the ideal orator) needs to be able to address every possi-ble topic, and to argue both sides of any issue (cf. above, 381).Therefore he must have encompassing knowledge, for ‘what can bemore insane than the hollow sound of even the best and most dis-tinguished words, if they are not based upon thought and knowledge?’(1.51: quid est enim tam furiosum quam verborum vel optimorum atque ornatis-simorum sonitus inanis, nulla subiecta sententia nec scientia?).29Cicero’s advo-cacy of abstract commonplaces in the second book (above, 388) hasan important role to play as a practical underpinning of this view.For unlike the normal, specific commonplaces, the abstract ones canindeed be applied to every subject; they thus provide a method for‘converting’ every kind of knowledge into (persuasive) speech.30The emphasis on knowledge in De oratorecorresponds preciselywith its importance in the contemporary struggle between the philoso-phers and the rhetoricians. It was often formulated in terms of thedistinction between thesesand hypotheses, i.e., general and specific ques-tions (cf. 359 above). The latter included court cases, which werecovered by rhetorical theory, and they were generally considered the‘property’ of the rhetoricians. The theses, however, included typicallyphilosophical and semi-philosophical questions, such as ‘What is wis-dom?,’ ‘Should one marry?,’ and others belonging to the realm ofethics, and such as ‘What is the size of the sun?’ and other issuesof physics.The rhetoricians usually began their treatises by dividing rhetori-cal matters into thesesand hypotheses, thus claiming that their theoriesalso covered the philosophical material of the former; some restrictedthemselves to claiming the ethical questions, others seem to have28Cf. 3.52–54, 91–93, 105–107, 120; quotations from 53 (in quo igitur hominesexhorrescunt?: ‘Who is it, then, who sends shivers down your spine?’) and 92 (appa-ratu nobis opus est...;. . . ut ego in aedilitate laboravi, quod cotidianis et vernaculis rebus satisfacere me posse huic populo non putabam).29See also 1.17, 20, 48, 50–51, 54; 3.19; cf.

The philosophers did not fail to take this oppor-tunity for counterattack, and ridiculed the rhetoricians’ claims; mat-ters of ethics and political theory were, they said, clearly their property,not that of the rhetoricians (cf. 1.41–44, 85–86). Moreover, apartfrom the theses, some of them argued, possibly with Plato’s Phaedrusin hand, that the importance of emotional appeal in oratory neces-sitated knowledge of psychology, a philosophical subject again notcovered by the rhetoricians (cf. 1.87).Cicero, in a sense, agrees but also disagrees with both camps, andcombines what he regards as the valid arguments on both sides inorder to support his own position. A significant part of what is saidin book 3 about the orator’s mastery of all subjects is formulated interms of the theses(3.107–125), which, he makes Crassus say, reallybelong to the orators, not to the philosophers. That is, he agrees inprinciple with the rhetoricians’ claim on the theses, though not in thesense that they should be part of rhetorical theory, but in the sensethat they should fall under the orator’s competence. On the otherhand he subscribes to the philosophers’ criticism that the rhetori-cians have nothing at all to offer to substantiate their claim; and healso believes that knowledge of philosophy is necessary if the oratoris to be able to speak about the theses, and (as mentioned above) ifhe is to be successful in arousing his audiences’ emotions.To these arguments Cicero adds a few others (above, 393–394),but it is these conspicuous borrowings from the two opposing campsthat are meant to signal that his view is a synthesis, which shouldresolve the quarrel. ‘If,’ Crassus says, ‘they [i.e. the philosophers]allow that he [the learned orator] is also a philosopher, the quarrelis over’ (3.143:. . . docto oratori...quem si patiuntur eundem esse philoso-phum, sublata controversia est). The same emerges from his notion thathis synthesis would only restore the original unity that obtained beforeSocrates, who caused the fateful ‘rupture between the tongue andthe brain’ (3.61: discidium...quasi linguae atque cordis). Virtually all thepassages in book 3 about the orator’s knowledge are actually dom-inated by this (quasi)historical approach, and the appeal to the exam-ples of the great past (such as the Seven Wise Men, Solon, and31Cf.

Moreover, I have described themas his own reaction to the views of rhetoricians and philosophers.Many earlier analyses, by contrast, have assumed that Cicero’s viewswere for the most part derived from elsewhere; opinions have differedon how closely he followed his ‘source(s),’ and on who these sourceswere. Philosophers from, or close to, the Academy have been themost popular candidates: Philo of Larissa, the last head of theAcademy (from 110/09 B.C. until his death in 84/3); Charmadas,who figures so prominently in De oratoreitself; and Philo’s pupilAntiochus of Ascalon, who later rebelled and founded his own school,which he called the ‘Old Academy.’ These hypotheses cannot bediscussed at any length here; suffice it to say that none of the ‘proofs’generally advanced can stand close scrutiny.32Yet it seems likely that Cicero drew some inspiration from Philo,whose lectures in Rome in 88 B.C. greatly fascinated him and firedhim with enthusiasm for philosophy (Brut.306). For, sometime before91, while still in Athens, Philo had introduced the teaching of rhetoricinto the Academy (De or.3.110; Tusc.2.9). Indeed, Philo is a likelycandidate for having supplied the list of abstract commonplaces in2.163–173, and the division of thesesoffered by Crassus in 3.111–118and ascribed to ‘very learned people’ (3.117; cf. 114, 116). Yet Philohad no real synthesis to offer, as is clear, for instance, from De ora-tore3.110, where his inclusion of rhetorical teaching in the Academyis presented as another attack on the orator, not as a reconciliation.32The idea of Philo as Cicero’s source goes back to the fascinating first chap-ter “Sophistik, Rhetorik, Philosophie in ihrem Kampf um die Jugendbildung” of H.von Arnim, Leben und Werke des Dio von Prusa(Berlin: Weidmann 1898): 97–111; forAntiochus as the source see W.

It is his concentration onthe personal qualities of his orator that allows him to devise anddefend this synthesis. Rhetoric, i.e. rhetorical theory as taught by therhetoricians, is most severely criticized, in the first place on the tech-nical level. In his view, the concept of the activities of the orator,consistently applied, yields a ‘theory’ that is far better suited to thecomplexities of real-life oratory than the rigid, ‘product-centered’rules of the rhetoricians (above, § 3). On the level of the discipli-nary quarrel, it has been argued here that Cicero’s views must beinterpreted against the contemporary background, and that he agreesas well as disagrees with both camps (§ 4). That is, in a typicallyCiceronian, undogmatic spirit he takes what he sees as the good ele-ments from both positions to support his own view of oratory; healso supplements these with other material, such as the unusual inter-pretation of Socrates as the originator of a split between speakingand thinking. The result is his idiosyncratic and surprising pictureof the ideal orator: the Roman statesman who combines eloquencewith universal knowledge.33For a (slightly) more extensive discussion of (Charmadas and) Philo see Leeman-Pinkster-Wisse (1996): 98–99, also about Cicero’s own Partitiones oratoriae. This shortwork reflects an Academic system (section 139), almost inevitably (very closely relatedto) Philo’s, and despite important similarities, it shows significant differences withDe oratore. In my view, T. Reinhardt’s recent attempt at reconstructing Philo’s rhetoricis unhelpful (“Rhetoric in the Fourth Academy,” Classical Quarterly50 (2000): 531–547);I have not been able to use C.

The few remaining have been reduced tosilence, since the dominion of Caesar has meant the extinction ofall free political debate; the remaining patroniin the field are incom-petent parvenus,having emerged thanks to their recent social climbingand self-interested loyalty to the dictator (157). But the ‘death of elo-quence’ that Brutusso often laments also has causes less inciden-tal: in recent decades, the crisis of the Republic and the ever moredominant role of the armies of the great potentates had progressivelyMAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 401"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"402 relegated to a secondary level the word as an instrument of per-suasion and of political mediation.Unlike De oratore, Brutusis rather lacking in details of scene-paint-ing; there are only a couple: the portico in which Cicero strolls whenhe receives the visit of his friends (10) and the garden decoratedwith a statue of Plato, near which they sit to converse in leisurelyfashion (24). In spite of this explicit reference to Plato, Brutuspro-ceeds in its development in a manner more akin to the ‘Aristotelian’form of dialogue: rather than a close encounter between three char-acters marked by lively interaction, Cicero prefers a continuous expo-sition, wherein the treatment that he unfolds is interrupted only rarelyby the brief interventions of the other interlocutors. Characterizationof the latter, particularly that of Brutus, does not appear especiallyrespectful of historical reality: it is improbable, in particular, thatBrutus, whose opinions about eloquence were markedly different fromthose of Cicero (cf. below, 408, 428), would have accepted him inthe role of intellectual guide that Cicero assigns himself in the lit-erary fiction.Nevertheless, the conversation does not lack vivacity, and the pro-tagonist’s interlocutors are not mere puppets devoid of life; the prin-cipal value of Brutus’literary form consists in its capacity to render,in a manner that is lively and rich in effects, the atmosphere of anintellectual milieu that knows how to preserve the passion for researchand debate, while under the oppressive mantle of a dictatorship. Onemight say, rather, that such a passion has been nourished preciselyby the crisis of the Republic. The commemoration of eloquence pre-sented in the dialogue is also that of an entire period of Roman his-tory in which politics and persuasion prevailed over the force ofarms. Through their taste for antiquarian research, the charactersexpress a pietasthat is charged with nostalgia for a tradition thatthey warn is quickly dying away.Sources and methodThe genesis of Brutusis best understood against the background ofthe contemporary blossoming of investigations into history and nationaltraditions; but in the dialogue, antiquarian research attains the dig-nity of a broad historical-literary synthesis.

At Rome and in the rest of Italy, a popular readership inter-ested in the contents of speeches, whether as sources of informationon political life or as products of literary quality, developed ratherslowly. By the mid-point of the second century B.C., eloquence wasconsidered above all an oral performance; the orators who had theability of putting their own speeches into writing were not very many;in certain cases, these speeches remained only sketches (commentarii),which in part were preserved in the archives of aristocratic families,or were put at the disposal of young orators for their education.Another problem arose from the difficulty of organizing the historyof eloquence in accordance with a reliable chronological framework;in that regard, Cicero was able to put trust in the recent liber annalisof Atticus, a manual that ordered, according to the succession ofmagistrates, the internal history of Rome from the origins up to con-temporary times.5Atticus had probably arranged the careers of indi-vidual people in the format of a handy outline.In Brutus, Cicero arranges the orators according to aetatesthat taketheir names from particularly prominent figures (Cato, Galba, Carbo,the Gracchi, etc.). Up till the age of the Gracchi, “minor” oratorsare grouped around the principal figures, in an order that is roughlychronological. For the more recent period, Cicero appears to followa more precise method, employing an order based in the first placeon rank (first the consulars, then the non-consulars), and then onthe birth date of individual orators or on a chronology that can be3K.

The first is the orator of the ‘plain’ style, whoprefers a calm and concise exposition; in stylistic choices, he allowshimself to be guided by the criterion of sober and controlled ele-gance, and he avoids appeals to the emotions. The second is theorator of the ‘grand’ style, who aspires to make a very strong emo-tional impact on the listener, and thus has ample recourse to rhetor-ical and emotional ornamentation. Cicero’s preference is, obviously,for an orator of the latter type, or, to be more precise, for an ora-tor who demonstrates the capacity to master all of the diverse reg-isters of style, and who is aware of the fact that on many occasions,only recourse to the ‘grand’ register will permit him to win over hislisteners victoriously (Cicero himself was convinced that he personifiedthe model of such an orator). On the other hand, eloquence of thefirst type, that is, measured eloquence in the plain style, was thefavorite of Cicero’s detractors, the Atticists, who in Brutusrepresenta polemical target not always declared, but rarely out of sight (cf.below, 408 ff.).Consequently, Cicero accords noteworthy importance to the jux-taposition of these two styles in his reconstruction of the develop-ment of Roman eloquence: in this reconstruction, the need for takingup a position against the Atticists is joined to a justification of Cicero’sown choices in the field of eloquence.For this reason, the juxtapositon of the ‘plain’ oratorical style withone that is able to subjugate the emotions of the listeners by its vari-ety and its power is at the center of some anecdotes about the mostdistinguished representatives of past eloquence; these Cicero cleverlyinserts at a few crucial points in his treatment, and they serve also6Douglas, (1966): clii ff. and, by the same author, “Oratorum Aetates,” AmericanJournal of Philology 87 (1966): 290–306, with corrections and clarifications by G.

Let us recalltwo of the most appealing of these anecdotes: first, a violent andemotional discourse by Servius Sulpicius Galba immediately securesthe acquittal of his clients, who were associates in a corporation ofpublicani, something that the lucid and sober Laelius did not achievein the course of numerous interventions (85–90); secondly, the vari-ety that Crassus’ eloquence is capable of achieving allows him to tri-umph over the legal competence of Scaevola in the celebrated caseof Manius Curius (194–199).Mention of the causa Curianais inserted within the context of alonger digression, which has as its theme the necessity of the oratorknowing how to win the approval not only of the experts, but pri-marily of the common people who constitute the great majority ofhis listeners (183–200). Cicero insists on the difference between arefined literary product that addresses a small number of demand-ing readers and a speech that moves a multitude and proposes tomanipulate their emotions. Here too the target, more or less implicit,is the Atticists: in fact, Cicero emphasizes that not all share his opin-ion that the strength of an orator is judged in terms of the effectsof persuasion that he knows how to achieve; and that for this rea-son, the one who is pleasing to the people and who can controltheir emotions, is also necessarily pleasing to the experts. The latterare superior to laymen only through their greater competence in ars,that is, in their ability to analyze and appreciate the rhetorical meansby which the orator is able to achieve his effects on the audience.As one sees, though the impulse for the literary elaboration of elo-quence is certainly very strong in Cicero, he nevertheless shows him-self to be aware of the fact that the art of speaking cannot abandonthe peculiar characteristics that make it primarily an instrument ofpersuasion and of domination over its audience.7A third anecdote is drawn from Cicero’s personal experience, andrefers to a contemporary orator, Marcus Calidius. In sections 274–279,his uncommon gifts in regard to style—gifts both as a critic of tal-ent and as a great writer—are recounted. Cicero recalls the smooth7On the other hand, there emerge also in Brutus(sporadically, but with a cer-tain insistence) elements of a standard of evaluation that is based on different cri-teria. The political climate of the dictatorship (in which the words of the oratorhave an already very restricted possibility of being respected in the context of afree debate) induces Cicero at times to associate eloquence with ‘artistic’ activities,which do not fall within the scope of immediate utility (Narducci [1997]: 117 ff.).BRUTUS:     405MAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 405"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"and translucent (pellucens) style of Calidius, the fluid and flexible con-struction of its periods, its unequaled clarity, punctuated by ‘figures,’a most capable arrangement of words, a rhythm varied and markedby dissimilar cadences, a studied marshalling of arguments, a dignifiedand elegant delivery (actio). Calidius achieved excellent results as longas he was informing and delighting his audience; he did not, how-ever, have the ability to inflame his listeners. At this point Cicerointroduces the episode of a court case in which Calidius accused acertain Quintus Gallius of having attempted to poison him (277–278).Calidius spoke with his accustomed elegance and dignity. And Cicero,who appeared for the defense, obtained an acquittal of the chargeof alleged poisoning, by maintaining that Calidius’ placid tone wasprecisely the reason that his denunciation did not seem credible.There was no passion in his words: how could one explain suchcoolness and nonchalance on the part of a person who claimed tocarry irrefutable proof of an attempt on his own life?It would be erroneous to consider Calidius an ‘Atticist,’ or evena precursor of that movement. The only thing he had in commonwith the Atticists was his inability to arouse the emotions of his lis-teners; on the contrary, the fundamental importance that he, accord-ing to Cicero, attributed to oratorical rhythm distanced him fromthem.8Thus, once again this shows that ‘plain style’ and ‘grand style’are extremely general categories to which Cicero assigns the prac-tices of orators who are very diverse among themselves, and whodo not belong to any particular ‘school.’Cicero presents these two, diverse tendencies as determined by acontrast of style, of taste, and also of personal temperament; but ithas been suggested that they may have their origin in two, moregeneral ‘streams’ of Roman eloquence, conditioned in their develop-ment by a complex intermingling of historical and sociological fac-tors.9The important changes in the composition of the courts andin the organization of legal procedures at the beginning of the 2ndcentury B.C., the success of democratic leaders (such as the Gracchi),and the continuous emergence of accusers from outside of the aris-tocratic class had fostered the blossoming of an eloquence of ‘pathos,’8A.

This eloquence had ample recourse to fierce aggressiveness,to vehement denunciation of the injustices and abuses of the aristo-crats, and to appeals for mercy and compassion toward the victimsin question (miserationes).The traditional aristocracy did not like resorting to such appeals,which they considered degrading and harmful to their personal pres-tige in the presence of the lower classes. Some of their exponentsdenounced the ‘demagoguery’ of their adversaries in the name ofthe general and higher interests of the state, and they offered a kindof coolness and reserve in opposition to it. For this reason, their ora-torical style privileged elegance and self-control; it was sparing ofwords, very measured in delivery; it put aside a forceful voice andemotional display. A style of this kind desired to signify, so to speak,a discrete and efficacious authority, a social ‘distance’ that derivedfrom long-standing membership in the ruling class and from theinnate calling to the exercise of power. This kind of eloquence canbe exemplified by what we know of the styles of Scipio Aemilianusand Laelius.Even if the juxtaposition of the two types of eloquence had itsroots in political struggle, in concrete oratorical practice it was notnecessarily equivalent to the juxtaposition of different political sides.The tendency to raise the emotions of the public (or the absence ofsuch tendency) corresponds not merely to a choice of political alle-giance, but also to different ways of relating to a popular audience,amounting either to a recognition or a denial of the ‘sovereignty’ ofthe common people as the source of final judicial authority. In Brutus90, Cicero recounts how Servius Sulpicius Galba, by stooping to sup-plicate the people, and by stirring their pity, avoided being subjectedto a just legal process for the treacherous massacre that he had per-petrated in Spain; and how Cato the Elder, in his Origines, haddenounced with indignation his recourse to this kind of behavior.This view, however, had changed remarkably already by the timeof Cicero’s youth. The courts had, by that time, become one of theprincipal tools of political struggle, and their verdicts had strongrepercussions on the equilibrium of society. All orators, whetherspeaking for the prosecution or the defense, held in common by thistime the necessity of making an impact on the hearts of a vast pub-lic, and therefore of resorting to long and elaborate speeches thatwere emotionally moving and elevated in style.

The author of Brutusevidently tried to removethe young man, who seemed to him to be well on his way to anoratorical career, from the influence of the Atticists. Cicero’s increas-ing hostility toward Atticism in subsequent works (Oratorand De optimogenere oratorum) is probably an indication of the lack of any agreementwhatsoever with this position on the part of his chosen interlocutor.From the beginning of our century,12there has been much dis-cussion about whether Atticism constituted a ‘long-term’ phenome-non of hellenistic culture, set in contrast to the prevailing ‘Asianic’taste,13or rather a peculiar phenomenon of Roman culture, perhaps10David (1992): 623.11F.

Based on whatcan be extracted from the whole of ancient testimony, the Atticistsplaced under discussion the fundamental direction of Cicero’s elo-quence; according to their opinion, he had not distanced himselfsufficiently from the most degenerate and corrupt characteristics ofAsianic style (cf. below, 416 ff.); to the Atticists Cicero appearedslack and enervated, too redundant in copia verborumand in the abuseof figures, too attentive to the effects of rhythm and sonority.The adversaries of Cicero found in Attic eloquence the model ofa concise, sober, and pure style; in the wake of the Greek neoclas-sical reaction, they privileged Lysias and Thucydides, writers whomCicero in turn judged (the former) lean and emaciated, in spite ofindubitable elegance, and (the latter) knotty and dense, to the pointof obscurity.In Brutus, Cicero’s response to his critics originates from a differentdefinition of the same conception of ‘Attic’ style. He insists on a17Kennedy (1972): 240.18For example, in rendering his Greek models, Cicero frequently prefers thehypotactic construction to the paratactic; relative clauses or subordinate clauses intro-duced by cum, are substituted for participles, in which Latin, as is well known, isconsiderably poorer than Greek.

Orator 31).The Ciceronian polemic leads one to believe that Gaius LiciniusCalvus must have been considered one of the principal figures ofthe Atticist movement.21Cicero’s judgment on his young rival, nowdead for some time, endeavors to maintain objectivity and equilib-rium (283 ff.): the refined elegance of Calvus, for example, is men-tioned. But Cicero insists on the fact that Calvus, with his exasperatingquest for stylistic leanness, rendered his own eloquence ‘bloodless.’Thus his style met with the favor of his listeners, but it was too coldand intellectual to move his audience’s emotions.One of the more thorny problems in interpreting Brutuslies in thefact that the portrait of Calvus sketched here does not coincideentirely with that presented by other ancient sources.22Numerouspassages from diverse authors insist on the huge success that Calvusexperienced, and in particular on his violent and excited actio, andon his efficacy in inflaming the emotions of the people. We shouldprobably not call into question the personal intellectual honesty ofCicero; it may be possible, however, that in some way, his personalcriteria of interpretation, developed by his long experience as an ora-tor, somewhat clouded his judgment.19This aspect of Cicero’s argumentation is stressed by J. M. May, “The MonologisticDialogue as a Method of Literary Criticism: Cicero, Brutus285–289 and Horace,Epistle2.1.34–39,” Athenaeum78 (1990): 177–178.20Narducci (1997): 128.21On the connections between Cicero and Calvus, cf.

The misunderstanding betweenthe two could have arisen from the fact that Calvus saw in Ciceroniancopiaand amplitudofactors that were liable to dilute rather than rein-force emotional intensity; while Cicero saw, in the concentrated inten-sity of Calvus’ expression, only a monotonous exilitasand an incapacityof reaching, when necessary, the heights of grandiose pathos.The Development of Roman EloquenceThe anti-Atticist polemic in Brutusis not yet the fundamental aimof work, as it will be in Oratorand De optimo genere oratorum; in hisoutline of the history of Roman eloquence, Cicero naturally tried todelineate the reasons for his own stylistic preferences, but what heintended to write was, first and foremost, a work of history and lit-erary criticism. The development of Roman eloquence is recountedas a difficult ascent through the generations, each of which succeededin producing at most one or two orators of real talent. The highlywearisome evolution of an art that is also in a position to secure thegreatest degree of social prestige explains itself by its extremely difficultand comprehensive character. To confirm this assertion, Cicero recalls23Lebek (1970): 84–95; W. Stroh, “Die Nachahmung des Demosthenes in CicerosPhilippiken,” in Éloquence et Rhétorique chez Cicéron, edited by W. Ludwig, Entretienssur l’Antiquité Classique, Vol. 28 (Vandœuvres-Genève: Fondation Hardt 1982): 27.412 MAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 412"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"that oratory developed slowly also in Greece, where it saw the lightwhen the other arts had already reached full maturity.For the archaic period, Cicero does not have at his disposal anyreliable testimony about the eloquence of the orators whom he con-siders; he refuses to furnish any hint about Roman oratory in theperiod preceding the expulsion of the monarchy. Instead, in whatrefers to the beginnings of the res publica, he relies on a largely con-jectural procedure, very noteworthy from the point of view of his-toriographical method: the oratorical abilities of individual characterscan be deduced from the importance of their role as developed inpolitical life. The first to whom such a procedure is applied is LuciusJunius Brutus. The history of Roman eloquence begins thus with apresumed ancestor of the dedicatee of the dialogue; but this placeof honor, reserved for the first consul, serves also to underscore theinseparable bond between oratory and political activity which hadcharacterized the free res publicafrom its beginnings.24After having reviewed the few political men of the archaic age,for whom it is possible to presume a certain fluency of eloquence,Cicero dwells a little more abundantly on Cornelius Cethegus (57–60),the first person known (thanks to some verses of Ennius’ Annales) tohave enjoyed a certain prestige as an orator. Then he comes quicklyto Cato, who represents one of the pivotal points in his treatment.The censor is presented as the first orator truly worthy of the name.His qualities of elegance, acuteness, and conciseness come directlyinto comparison with those of Lysias; but according to the judgmentof Cicero, Cato surpasses Lysias by his expressive vigor, and by hiscapacity to master, together with the genus subtile, also the other generadicendi. Cicero employs the example of Cato to reproach the Atticistsfor a maniacal love of the foreign: according to their own criteria,they would have already in their national tradition a model for theirinspiration, but they don’t even take Cato into consideration.2524K.

Cicero also here intends to demonstrate that elo-quence developed through a slow process of historical evolution: forthis reason, the search for stylistic models from the remote past wouldbe an error. But despite these considerable reservations, the encomiumof Cato’s oratory is profound and sincere, in total agreement withthe very elevated estimation of his character to which the De senec-tutewill give expression not long afterwards.The reconstruction of the development of eloquence at the endof the 2nd and beginning of the 1st century strongly insists on theacquisition of an artistic form of expression, facilitated moreover byimproved practice with Greek models. Marcus Aemilius LepidusPorcina, a younger contemporary of Galba, is remembered for hisstress on the elaboration of the period, a feat that Cicero consid-ered decisive in the development of eloquence and of literary prosein general (95 ff.). Additional important stimuli for perfecting arsdicendiwere provided in the age of Tiberius Gracchus: the institu-tion of the first permanent tribunals and the introduction of thesecret ballot in trials before the people, which reduced the possibil-ity of the aristocracy imposing its decisions on their clientele throughvarious kinds of pressures (106). Through these provisions, the per-suasive force of eloquence started to become one of the most efficaciousinstruments for controlling collective opinions and emotions.Cicero does not demonstrate any understanding of the motives forthe Gracchan social agitation; his frank recognition of the merit ofthe eloquence of these two figures, whom in political terms he detestedso greatly, is, however, a sign of his great critical equilibrium: heaffirms that, for grandeur and impressiveness of style, Gaius espe-cially is still recommended reading for the young (126).In the period of transition from the 2nd to 1st century, Cicero(178–180) registers the emergence of a group of orators, partly munic-ipal in origin, who are characterized by an eloquence that is stronglyaggressive toward the aristocratic class. These conduct themselvesprecisely like accusers, and they find the means of making them-selves appreciated through attacks carried out against the exponentsof the senatorial class; Cicero stamps them collectively with the dis-dainful term rabulae(‘rabid dogs’). In Brutus, there is entirely lacking414 MAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 414"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"any allusion to the institution in which these orators will have prob-ably served their apprenticeship: the first school of Latin rhetoric,opened in Rome by Plotius Gallus (a client of Marius) sometime inthe late 90s, and quickly forced to close by the censors (Cicero dilatedupon this episode in De oratore3.93 ff.). These rabulaeappeared tojoin a lack of culture deriving from an overly hasty and rough for-mation in eloquence to a more general defect that Cicero ascribesto all the orators of non-Roman origin (169–172): the lack, in termsof diction and pronunciation, of that indefinable color urbanitatisthatis typical of a native of the city. Not by chance does Cicero insiston the importance of linguistic qualities acquired within familiar sur-roundings (210–213): these constitute one of the criteria that permita distinction to be made between the parvenus and those peoplewho, merely by the intonation of their voice, prove that they belongto the city aristocracy; their manner of speaking justifies in itself thesocial role that belonged to their ancestors.26One of the censors who had decreed the closure of the school ofPlotius Gallus was Lucius Licinius Crassus; with him and with MarcusAntonius, Latin eloquence had finally reached, in the judgment ofCicero, a mature perfection that allowed it never to fear a com-parison with great Greek models (138). After a very gradual prepara-tory period, the blossoming was unexpected, so to speak: Antoniusand Crassus quickly carried oratory to the highest level; furtherprogress will be possible only by one who has in himself all thepower of a superior cultural formation in philosophy, in civil law,in history (161). Cicero evidently alludes to that which he judged tobe his own contribution to eloquence: already in De oratore(1.79, 95;see also, e.g., 3.80, 95) he had several times prefigured, especiallythrough the voices of Antonius and Crassus, the birth of an entirelynew type of orator, which he considered himself to represent.Cicero had already chosen Antonius and Crassus as his protago-nists in De oratore: in Brutushe is careful not to bore his readers withthe repetition of themes and episodes of the sort that were alreadydetailed in the preceding work; thus, while he digresses, recalling thestages of Crassus’ oratorical career, he does not choose to dwell onthe two great trials wherein the eloquence of Antonius had had the26E.

Antonius’ ability in inventio, his capacity to arrange hiscomposition, and his insuperable memory are emphasized (139); itis not by chance that these are the same three parts of rhetoric thatwere assigned to Antonius in De oratore. By employing an oratorwhom he had been able to know personally, Cicero is thus in aposition to provide exhaustive information, be it about Antonius’actio, overwhelming yet not histrionic, or about his voice, a littlehoarse by nature, and hence particularly suitable for passages involv-ing pathos in which he especially excelled (141–142).Of the two great orators of the time of his youth, Cicero doesnot at all conceal his own preference for Lucius Licinius Crassus;he will have considered him more akin to himself in terms of a morecareful and refined style and a propensity for an abundant use ofelegant and jocular wit (143). Also employing an actiothat was a bitmore restrained than that of Antonius, Crassus was impetuous inspeech, and when necessary he knew how to invest his voice witha tone of just indignation. The portrait of Crassus drawn by Cicerois that of a supreme equilibrium that knows how to reconcile andblend opposing qualities: he told his jokes with a tone of great seri-ousness; in terms of style he knew how to be perornatusand perbrevisat the same time (158); in all of his demeanor he combined thegreatest amount of affability with a good dosage of severity (148).The account of Crassus’ career in eloquence (158–165) is inter-esting also because it shows how such a career constitutes a newmodel for oratorical practice. Even throughout all of the 2nd cen-tury, the most powerful and prominent personalities had frequentlytaken on the role of the accuser, as did Cato, well into his old age;the attack on a corrupt governor was still inscribed fully among theduties of patronage to which the aristocrats were bound before thesubjects and allies of Rome. Crassus, on the other hand, acted asan accuser only when he was an adulescens(159: the trial was thatagainst Gaius Carbo), for the purpose of procuring prestige and noto-riety, then subsequently specialized in the role of defender. This is416 MAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 416"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"explained by the fact that in this period the practice of accusation,having fallen to the hands of parvenus of doubtful origin, was los-ing its social esteem. The opening of the privilege of popular indict-ment had insured for people who did not belong to the aristocracythe means for making a way for themselves; added to this is the factthat the aristocracy felt directly threatened by the alliance betweenaccusers and equestrian jurors. It was Crassus himself, now in hisprime, who launched a very violent attack on the factio iudicum etaccusatorumin his speech supporting the lex Servilia Caepionis(163 ff.),which partially returned control of judicial activity to the hands ofthe senators; his censorial provision that closed the school of therhetores Latiniprobably also had as its aim a similar target.In a climate that enjoined distancing oneself from the detestedaccusers, some young aristocrats, among whom was Crassus, hadconsequently introduced a new rule of conduct—that of serving asan accuser only at the beginning of one’s career, and if successful,no more than one time.27In the subsequent period, the practice ofserving as an accuser only seldom, and preferably in one’s youngeryears, increasingly solidified itself. Cicero himself fell in line withsuch behavior (his only accusation will be that against Verres, whichhe likens, not by chance, to a form of patronage on behalf of theSicilians), and he will present it, in the De officiis (2.49 ff.), as anobvious and indisputable norm of conduct.As to the oration on the lex Servilia—one of the very few thatCrassus had left in written form—, Cicero asserts that it had servedas his ‘teacher’ from his earliest years of study (164). He leaves toAtticus the task of objecting that the pupil turned out to be far supe-rior to his teacher (292–297); but Cicero confirms (298) that at thetime of his adolescence there was no better model to imitate. Cicero’sintention is to offer a sincere encomium to the memory of Crassus;but his words also allow us to understand that shortly after him, andprecisely because of Cicero’s own work, Roman eloquence was quicklyto make a new and definite jump in quality.27David (1992): 335 ff.BRUTUS:     417MAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 417"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Cicero and the orators of his own timeScholars have noted few, but significant omissions in the great crowdof orators recorded by Cicero: among the orators of the precedinggeneration, Marius and Sulla are conspicuous for their absence;among Cicero’s contemporaries, Clodius and Catiline. Particularly inthe case of the latter two, motives of personal aversion would havecome into play.Cicero shows his willingness to abide by his restriction of not men-tioning the living; he does, however, entrust to Brutus and to Atticusrespectively the task of speaking about the oratory of Marcellus andCaesar (248 ff.). There is here, naturally, a polite meta-literary joke:Cicero wants to attract his reader’s attention to the difference betweenhimself as ‘character’ (who refuses to speak on a stated topic) andhimself as ‘author’ (who speaks on that topic through the mouth ofthe other characters whom he has placed on the stage).The direct coupling of the dictator with one of his more intractableopponents is an act not lacking in political courage; on the otherhand, in the highly favorable evaluation of Caesar’s oratorical style,there is no self-interested flattery, but only the objectivity of a criticwho strives to keep the very serious disagreements over the admin-istration of the res publicaoutside of the discussion.The eloquence of Caesar has frequently—and probably with somedegree of inaccuracy—been traced back to Atticist tastes by mod-ern scholars; the point of contact was above all the elegance of lan-guage, refined by meticulous literary study. Cicero endeavors, however,to keep Caesar outside of the quarrel, and at the same time to dis-tance his eloquence as much as possible from that of the Atticists;in the remark referring to the quality of linguistic purity, we canprobably see an attempt to take account of requirements demandedby Caesar in De anologia, in a muted but sustained polemic over theapparent lack of appreciation of this matter in De oratore.28On theother hand, Atticus explains that linguistic correctness constitutesmerely ‘the base and foundation’ of Caesar’s eloquence; it is impor-tant that he adds all the ornaments of oratorical language, and an28For details on Caesar’s De anologia, see G.

This encomium will havebeen particularly appreciated by the author of Brutus: besides under-scoring the importance of Ciceronian stylistic choices, since comingfrom the greatest military leader of Rome, it represented a recog-nition of oratory’s position on the scale of civic values.A little later, Brutus, in one of those ‘natural’ passages of con-versation that are frequent in our dialogue, moves the focus of atten-tion from Caesar’s orations to his commentarii. The highly celebratedand very felicitous critical characterization of these, which followsshortly thereafter from Cicero’s mouth (262), has become a familiarguide for the modern interpretation of Caesar’s historiographicalstyle: the Ciceronian judgment places in relief the lean nudity, thenaturalness, the genuine pureness of this style. But in antiquity thisjudgment remained in general substantially isolated; the appreciationof the style of Caesar the writer has been due, above all, to mod-ern scholars. If read in their context, however, the words of Cicerodo not appear to be much more than a way of repaying the com-pliment contained in the dedication of De anologia:29elsewhere Ciceroalways showed himself far removed from considering concision—even if it be a luminous concision such as that of Caesar—as a spe-cial virtue of the style of history,30and in Brutus itself he had alreadyexplicitly asserted that historiography had not yet attained sufficientsplendor in Latin letters (228).Cicero also dedicates some words to the eloquence of the twoother leaders who, in the last decades, had rivaled Caesar for pri-macy. M. Crassus possessed insufficient natural gifts and a mediocrecultural formation; he spoke with practically no variation in tone,but had success as an advocate because of his great carefulness and29A.

Herenders homage, as impassioned as it is perplexed, to the memoryof Marcus Caelius, of Curio junior, of Publius Crassus, the son ofthe triumvir (280–282). These personalities are true and properemblems of the general crisis over traditional values against the back-ground of the ‘Roman revolution.’ In Cicero’s judgment, the sincererecognition of their talents is linked to a criticism of their boundlessambition, their substantial cynicism, and their will to burn the bar-riers that ultimately thwarted them. Here also Cicero shows himselfa master at varying the hues: the memory of Caelius and of Curioappears poised, as if in opposition, to that of a young man of thesame generation, who differed markedly in the quality of his char-acter (272): Gaius Piso, the son-in-law of Cicero, who had troubledhimself so much on Cicero’s behalf during his exile, and had dieda little before Cicero returned to his homeland. With the warmthof a father, the father-in-law places in relief the elegant oratory ofPiso, and still more his feelings of filial devotion and his capacity tocontrol his passions. Piso corresponds in every detail to the ideal ofyouthful reverence toward the maiores(ancestors), which Cicero morethan once will outline in his philosophical dialogues.Among contemporaries, the one whom Cicero wants for the mostpart to address is, naturally, Hortensius. This man, who was, forexample, devoid of almost any philosophical education, representedthe type of orator that was most unlike Cicero in his mature years;but still he is the one Roman orator to whom the author of Brutusattributes a greatness almost comparable to his own. At the begin-ning of his career, Cicero had been strongly affected by the Asianicmanner of Hortensius, who was greatly in vogue at that time. Partingfrom that style and working out a new one had been a slow anddifficult process for Cicero: he had excellent reasons for not endur-ing the fact that the Atticists would continue to see a manifestationof Asianism in his eloquence, which had been profoundly renovated,420 MAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 420"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"especially after his trip to the East for further study. It is also hispurpose to place in evidence the distance of his own style from theAsianic, which he deals with in a thorough characterization of thattendency (325). On a theoretical plane, Cicero acknowledges the exis-tence of two distinct types of Asianism: the first has a preference forbrief, graceful phrases constructed according to a rhythmically sophis-ticated scheme, and founded on antithesis and concinnity; the sec-ond is more ‘inflated,’ rapid and full of ardor in its language, floweredwith ‘figures.’ Hortensius, according to Cicero, excelled in both kinds:by the year of his consulship in 69 B.C., his natural ability and,even more, his unremitting discipline in exercise assured for him fullcommand over the broadest range of expressive resources (303). Fromother sources we know that he spoke in a sing-song manner, andhe accompanied the hammering of brief, pressing phrases with anactiostrongly histrionic, which placed great importance on the cease-less and affected play of the fingers. This actiocontributed much tothe success of Hortensius: his speeches, when simply read, were ratherdisappointing (Orator132). In the oratory of Hortensius, there wasprobably reflected something of the lifestyle of the aristocratic dandy,about which anecdotes arose.31By offering only a glimpse at these eccentricities, Cicero under-scores how the Asianic style was, in general, impoverished in termsof gravitas: it was more suited to youth than to the dignity of anelderly senator (326 ff.). In essence, Hortensius did not know howto adapt in the way that his mature years and elevated social ranknow acquired would have demanded. Moreover, after his consul-ship, Hortensius gave in to an inclination toward a sumptuous andrelaxed existence. As a result, he progressively relaxed the disciplineof rhetorical exercise—all the more in that he was aware of not hav-ing strong competitors among the men of his own rank, and he didnot even take into consideration those who had not yet gained thatstatus: the homo novusCicero does not miss the opportunity to givedue emphasis to the aristocratic arrogance of Hortensius.In a metaphor of incomparable effectiveness, Hortensius is likenedto one of those old paintings faded by age, which slowly lose thevividness of their colors (320): from day to day the orator’s elo-quence, which at one time had been very swift, became more and31Cf. e.g., Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae1.5.BRUTUS:     421MAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 421"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"more viscous; his periods became increasingly less spontaneous; thefrequent play of symmetry of expression no longer possessed the styl-istic quality that had been customary. In subsequent years, he desired,above all, not to look shabby next to Cicero—who after the con-sulship was now his equal in rank; this induced Hortensius to anearnest resumption of activity, yet he never managed a full recov-ery of his old splendor.The ‘autobiography’ of CiceroCicero skillfully interweaves, with happy artistic effect, the recogni-tion of Hortensius’ decline with that of his own ascent in eloquence.When he proceeds to delineate the stages of his own formation andcareer, he outlines a sort of ‘intellectual autobiography.’ Cicero begins(304 ff.) by recalling his youthful frequenting of the forum, the ora-tors whom he had been able to hear, his unceasing application torhetorical exercise and to the study of eloquence and the civil law,his immersion in philosophical studies during the period of Cinnandomination, when judicial normality appeared to have been abol-ished forever. In possession of an education that was practicallyalready complete, Cicero makes his debut in the forum during theyears of the Sullan restoration; among his first cases, he recallsexpressly only that on behalf of Sextus Roscius of Ameria, whichimmediately situated him among advocates of some repute (312).The Asianic style that Cicero had at that time practiced was forc-ing him to hold his voice always at its most elevated register, prac-tically without any relief of strain. His health threatened by thisconsuming practice, Cicero (who describes himself as having a ratherweak and sickly constitution in his youth) interrupted an alreadywell-advanced forensic career to take a long study tour to Greeceand Asia Minor, for the purpose of learning how to moderate hisown eloquence. The trip was an occasion for renewing his philo-sophical studies and, of course, for visiting the most famous rhetori-cians. He found particularly profitable the teaching of Molon ofRhodes, whom he had already met in Rome at an earlier date. Theschool of Rhodes, whose influence on Roman oratory had been feltsince the time of Rhetorica ad Herennium, championed, as far as weknow, a kind of eloquence that could be defined as a middle roadbetween Atticism and the turgidity of Asianism.

Ciceroinsists on the transformation that was worked in him by the teach-ing of this celebrated rhetor: his own eloquence had ceased to boil;the river, with its flood mastered, had been forced to flow within itsbanks; the voice had learned to avoid excessive straining. Profoundlychanged, he made his return to Rome, in renewed physical condi-tion (316).The resumption of court cases was quick and very concentrated;Cicero judges having reached full maturity in his eloquence after hisyear as quaestor in Sicily (75 B.C.); soon thereafter, he offered proofof this in the case against Verres. It is precisely with the Verrinesthathe stops the detailed recounting of his own career (317): from thattime on his own eloquence would not have any serious competitors.The glorious moments that it experienced in subsequent years aretreated in a very general way, by pointing out in summary fashionespecially the salient characteristics of the most original oratoricalstyle that Rome had witnessed: the marvelous variety of tone, theability to illuminate the general implications of the case at issue, thefelicity of wit and humor, the recourse to philosophy and to history,the sovereign ability to steer the emotions of the audience (322).Cicero, however, does not entirely reprise the ideal that he had out-lined in De oratore: perhaps because he is aware of the decreasedemphasis on the social role of eloquence, he omits from considera-tion some of the leading ideas found in the preceding rhetorical dia-logue, such as the universality of the orator’s competence and hisaspiration to leadership of the community.32At the conclusion ofBrutus, Cicero is especially preoccupied with stressing the exceptionalnature of his own services: whatever his Atticist detractors mightthink of him, he was aware of having developed a kind of eloquencethat, by extolling itself above the irritating mannerism of Hortensius,opened new roads for Roman oratory.32Rathofer (1986): 244 ff.BRUTUS:     423MAY_f14_401-425 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 423"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"BCritical Editions and Commentaries of the BrutusDouglas, A.

In the catalogue of his philosophical and rhetorical worksthat opens the second book of De divinatione, he linked Oratorcloselyto De oratoreand Brutus, presenting the five ‘books’ that collectivelycomprise the three works as the articulation of a single generalreflection on eloquence (Div.2.4). And, in the eyes of its author,Oratorseems to constitute the high point of that reflection. In Januaryof 45, Cicero writes to his friend Lepta about having placed in thatbook all of the judgment he possessed on the topic of eloquence(Fam.4.18.4), as if intending to leave to posterity a kind of ‘aesthetictestament’2(on which, however, an openly doctrinaire character isat times bestowed by the urgency of his concentrated polemic againstthe Atticists). In fact, among Cicero’s rhetorical writings, Oratorisperhaps the one that has exercised the most profound influence onsubsequent generations (for example, Quintilian and St. Augustine),and this also owing to its consistent attempt to confer systematicorganization on a vast and complex body of material.MAY_f15_426-443 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 427"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"3We will concern ourselves with the contents of this second introduction below,437 ff.428 Marcus Brutus, the dedicatee of the work, did not, on the con-trary, remain convinced of its theses; in a letter to Atticus from Mayof 44, Cicero laments this fact with obvious bitterness:indeed, when, at his own entreaty I might almost say, I addressed tohim an essay on the best style of oratory, he wrote not only to mebut to you too that he could not agree with my preference. So praylet every man write as best suits himself. ‘Every man his own bride,mine for me. Every man his own love, mine for me’ (Att.14.20.3,trans. by D. R. Shackleton Bailey).The Structure of the workA superficial reading immediately reveals that Oratoris divided intotwo main sections: the first (1–139) is concerned with the definitionof the ideal orator and with the best kind of style; the second(140–238) contains a thorough study of oratorical rhythm (numerus);this second section opens with a sort of long ‘second introduction’(140–148), which functions as a ‘hinge,’ so to speak, between thetwo parts of the work.3The stitching together of the two sections isfar less than perfect; this—together with the relatively negligent man-ner of composition, characterized by numerous repetitions and con-tinuous returns to the same arguments—has given support to theidea that we are confronted with a kind of ‘assembly’ of a series ofletters addressed to Brutus, in which Cicero was responding to theobjections of his friend and was presenting to him his own concep-tion of the ars dicendi. According to this hypothesis, Cicero wouldhave mined the texts of a private literary correspondence to proceedrapidly (with some new interpolation) with the construction of a workdestined for publication. To whatever degree such a reconstructionmight be within the realm of possibility, it is wise, considering thelack of sufficient documentation, to maintain a certain skepticismtoward the possibility of establishing the phases of the editing ofOrator; to a large degree, repetitions and oversights (of a sort notabsent from others of Cicero’s works of his final years) might betraced back, more simply, to the haste with which the author wasworking in that period to escape, by study and literary work, fromMAY_f15_426-443 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 428"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"the anguish that the political situation and personal vicissitudes werecausing him (in the year 46 alone, Cicero composed in a single spurt,one after the other, Brutus, Paradoxa Stoicorum, the lost eulogy of Cato,and Orator).4We must also not dismiss the possibility that the fre-quent return—with slight variations in the point of view—to argu-ments already placed in consideration could in part comply with adeliberate strategy of persuasion with regard to the reader: the appar-ently erratic manner of treatment and the lack of systematic rigorappear aimed at avoiding, as much as possible, the aridity charac-teristic of handbooks (this will seem all the more necessary to Ciceroin an exposition that, as we shall soon see, presents a style that incertain respects is much more ‘manualistic’ compared to the con-versational freedom of De oratore). Cicero might have intended fromthe beginning to focus upon the goal of inculcating his own visionof eloquence very deeply in the mind of the reader by distributinghis own ideas on specific topics here and there throughout the entirework, and by continually amplifying and developing concepts alreadysketched and determined beforehand.5The material encountered in the first part of Oratoris, in largepart, the same as that of De oratore; but the abandonment of the dia-logue format and the choice of a didactic, treatise-like form seem toindicate that Cicero is addressing an audience more in need of anintellectually secure guide, even if it be one that is relatively morebound up with the merely technical aspects of eloquence: unlike Deoratore, specialized terminology is not avoided, and the treatment lacksthe aristocratic air that characterized the interlocutors of the greatdialogue of several years earlier.6On the other hand, Orator has,when compared to De oratore, a much more markedly polemical char-acter: with a determination even greater than is found in Brutus,Cicero aims at rebuffing the criticism coming from the Atticists. Heis preoccupied entirely with protecting his own aristocratic ethos, andwith not assuming a professorial tone that might offend the dedica-tee Brutus. In regard to the latter, even if not to the general reader,4For a reliable picture of the long discussion regarding the composition of Orator,I refer to the treatment of Yon (1964): xv–xx.5E. V.

It is possible that Brutus had requestedexplanations especially about certain aspects of eloquence to whichCicero had dedicated ample space in De oratore(perhaps incurringthe disapproval of the Atticists), and which nonetheless he did notafterwards revisit in Brutus. In short, it seems possible that Brutushadnot furnished sufficiently exhaustive answers to the objections of theAtticists regarding what they judged to be Cicero’s excessive appealto ‘figures,’ to rhythm, and to witticisms, and regarding his prefer-ence for an oratory capable of employing the diverse devices of‘amplification,’ whose goal is to win over the hearts of the audienceand to move with violence their emotions. Cicero, perhaps by expand-ing the boundaries of the questions specifically posed by Brutus, pre-sents his request as a way to make a much more general point: ‘youask me what kind of eloquence I prize the most, what I deem tobe the kind of eloquence to which nothing else is able to be added,the kind that I judge to be consummate and perfect’ (3).In order to define better the nature of this ‘perfect’ kind of elo-quence, Cicero refers explicitly to the Platonic theory of ideas (8–10):only after having established the concept itself of ‘perfection’ in arsdicendi, will it be possible to find, in the history of Greek and Romaneloquence, one or more ‘empirical’ models of the orator to imitatein preference to the others.

It is a question of great importance (but one which we are oblig-ated to leave, as it were, wholly aside) whether, in his very rapidexposition of the doctrine of ideas, Cicero does not contaminate gen-uinely Platonic thought with teaching marked by an Aristotelian andAcademic stamp: as is demonstrated by the comparison with theartist (who, in fashioning his work, holds his gaze fixed not on areal model, but on the forms of beauty present in his mind), the‘ideas’ are here considered not as transcendent archetypes, but asimmanent in the intellect.8Is it especially important for us to underscore how Cicero, vis-à-vis the reference to Platonic theory, claims, already in the openingof Orator, the great originality of his own ‘philosophical’ approach toeloquence (11); taking up again themes already amply covered in Deoratore, he acknowledges the debt that his own formation as an ora-tor owes in large part to philosophy; and he confirms that—thoughthe style of philosophical debates is not the most suitable for foren-sic disputes—the orator who lacks competence in philosophy will notbe in a position to speak on questions of the greatest significancewith the necessary richness of words and variety of concepts (12–16;cf. 118). One can detect a hint of hostility toward the lack of cul-tural background that Cicero probably imputed to some of his Atticistdetractors: in the course of the work (119 ff.) he refers implicitly tothe famous precept of Cato, rem tene, verba sequentur, to affirm thatthe orator will need to express ideas that are worthy of a cultivatedaudience, before thinking with what words, or in what way he willhave to express them; thus, besides philosophy, the orator must notbe ignorant of natural science, law, and history.More than the Platonic doctrine of ideas, there is yet another con-cept operating in the actual treatment of Orator, which Cicero hadthoroughly examined in his most recent philosophical studies and8This very difficult question has been treated in a sufficiently exhaustive man-ner in the commentary on Oratorby O. Jahn and W. Kroll, eds., M.

The decisive step in thisrespect had been accomplished by Panaetius (the Stoic whose treatiseon morals was the principal source for De officiis), who seems to haveintended préponas the exterior translation (in gestures, in posture,and in all behavior) of the interior harmony of the personality. InOratorthe concept of decorumis exploited above all in terms of itsmore properly ‘aesthetic’ merits; but the manner in which Cicerotreats decorum(70 ff.) shows how he already clearly recognizes theconnections of those merits with the moral theory concerning officia.Cicero makes use of the theory of prépon/decorumin Oratorin orderto establish a base of philosophical aesthetics for one of the leadingideas already enunciated in Brutus: the necessity of knowing how tovary and alternate the diverse registers of style. The model of theideal orator is realized in the perfect adaptation of the style to theparticular argument employed on each occasion: ‘he is eloquent whois able to speak about humble things in a plain style, matters ofmoderate significance in a tempered style, and grand things with avigorous seriousness’ (101); in other words, ‘he who will be able toregulate his speech in accord with what propriety demands’ (123:qui ad id quodcumque decebit poterit accommodare orationem). This demandexplains why Cicero concedes ample space in Oratorto the exposi-tion of the doctrine of ‘three styles’ (tria genera dicendi): the plain style,the middle style, and the elevated grand style (this doctrine is attestedfor the first time in a passage of Rhetorica ad Herennium4.8.11, butprobably had peripatetic origins).10Cicero more than once makes9The important contribution of M. Pohlenz well explains the concept of decorum:“To prepon.

Nevertheless, Ciceroclearly allows for the possibility of himself being considered as another,perhaps less illustrious, example approximating the ‘type’ of the idealorator. He explains (105 ff.) that the greater loftiness of Demosthenesis due in part to the fact of his having had great models to inspirehim, and great competitors whom he could confront and with whomhe could compete. When Cicero appeared on the scene of Romanoratory, he found, on the other hand, the ears of his fellow citizens‘fully hungry for this kind of eloquence, varied and blended equallyof all styles.’ Such a step in this direction had perhaps been taken,in the previous generation, by Antonius and Crassus; but subse-quently, neither Cotta nor Sulpicius nor Hortensius succeeded inproducing an oratory truly varied and capable of traversing thediverse registers of style.As one sees, the vehemence of his polemical objective causes Ciceroto modify in a substantial way the perspective adopted a very shorttime before in Brutus, which, without refusing to express some well-decided preferences, generally showed respect for the diverse and,at times, contrasting orientations of the orators of the past, and wasgenerously conscious of the slow evolution of Roman eloquence. InOrator, Cicero henceforth tends to present himself as the only one,among Romans of the past and the present, able to be called anorator. He confirms having identified, if nothing else, the coursewhich it was necessary to take; and having delivered and published,in the heat of manifold and absorbing political obligations, moreorations than those Greeks who were permitted by otium(which keptthem far from the administration of affairs of state) to dedicate them-selves liberally to intellectual activities. Cicero claims for himself theprogressive elaboration of an eloquence varied and complex; and hefurnishes numerous examples of the multiple registers of this elo-quence from his own orations, by offering some of them, in a fullypedagogical manner, as a ‘key’ for reading.

An innovation of Orator, perhapsdue to an original Ciceronian contribution to rhetorical theory—andcertainly based on his own oratorical experience—is the bond of per-fect correspondence tied between the three genera dicendiand threeduties of the orator: docerecomes to correspond with the plain style,delectarewith the middle style, and flecterewith the grand style11(thistheory survived throughout the entire Middle Ages, and awakenedto new life in the culture of Humanism).12Even though he contin-ues to insist on the necessity of variety, Cicero relatively privilegesthe grand style because of the impact that it exercises on the lis-teners, proving itself decisive in steering their decisions. Within thegrand style, particular importance is assigned to the very intense ele-ment of ‘pathos,’ which, more than anything else, is able to stir upin the audience very diverse emotions: indignation or indulgence,aversion or sympathy, hate or love. Cicero again cites Demosthenesas an example of excellence in ‘pathos,’ which, in a sense, demon-strates how close he comes to the ‘type’ of the ideal orator; whereas,in the Roman context, Cicero looks once again to his own orations,to the vehement attacks of the Verrines, to the appeals to pity (mise-rationes) found in many of his defense speeches (131 ff.). He recallsalso the ‘theatrical’ devices that he did not hesitate to employ inorder to move the jurors to pity, such as delivering his perorationwhile holding in his arms the infant son of the accused.

Naturally the particular favor accordedthe ‘grand’ style is also grounded in the specific polemical intentionsof Orator: right or wrong, Cicero identified one of the greatest weak-nesses of Atticist eloquence as precisely its inability to excite the emo-tions of the audience in an efficacious manner.It is interesting that Cicero, in representing the vigor of his ownemotional eloquence, affirms that it issues from a real ardor thatburns his own heart when he speaks before the public: ‘nor wouldthe listener ever be set on fire unless the speech that reached himwere fiery’ (Orator132: nec umquam is qui audiret incenderetur, nisi ardensad eum perveniret oratio). This representation corresponds largely withthe one that Antonius, another master of pathosand its very mov-ing effects, had provided of himself in De oratore(2.189 ff.); and it isa representation intended to negate explicitly the possibility that theemotions of the orator might be effective through pure simulation.It is curious, nevertheless, that this is precisely the position Ciceroassumes, on the contrary, in a problematic passage from the Tusculans(4.55). The context is that of a critique—conducted from the Stoicpoint of view that informs that work—of the Peripatetic teachingabout the usefulness of the emotions: the orator, Cicero here affirms,must confine himself to simulating rage, but it is not at all appro-priate for him actually to be angry. The contradiction, which can-not be eluded or minimized, can perhaps be explained in view ofthe momentary adherence to an almost radical Stoic thesis that char-acterizes the Tusculans: the effort to defend himself from the depres-sion following upon the very serious reversals of fortune that hadrecently beset both Cicero’s public and private life was not incon-sistent with the desire to reject entirely all disturbances of the spirit.From this passage of the Tusculansthere follows a long reflection onthe dialectics between truth and fiction in the art of the orator aswell as in that of the actor; the concepts expounded there will bereprised by Seneca (De ira2.17.1) and, much later, by Denis Diderotin Paradoxe sur le comédien.1313A fuller treatment of the problem is found in E.

Cicero draws from Greek sources,but enriches them with his own incomparable personal experience;even if all of the passages are not equally lucid, no other previousauthor seems to have concerned himself with these themes in sucha thoroughly examined way.The most narrowly technical aspects of this part of the work can-not be given the necessary depth of treatment in a Companionof thissort; at any rate, it is material that is frequently controversial tomodern scholars (a certain element of confusion seems to have beendue, as other times in Cicero’s writings, to the almost frenetic rapid-ity of composition).14Here we are interested above all in briefly out-lining the way in which the treatment of oratorical numerusis coupledwith the polemic against the Atticists.Cicero, in fact, reacts to the criticisms and objections of the Atticists,who probably saw in his search for rhythmical effects a sort of Asianictumor. He seems to consider the position of his detractors as archaiz-ing; already earlier (31) he had compared the admirers of Thucydides’knotty style to those who would continue to eat acorns and berriesafter the invention of agriculture; but in order to refute them more14An ample, exhaustive exhaustive exposition of this point can be found in Yon(1964).436 MAY_f15_426-443 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 436"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"effectively, he adopts a theory of the evolution of language that isvery closely connected with the theory of the development of thefigurative arts, and in particular with the development of sculpture,already expounded inBrutus(70). In that dialogue, which is dedi-cated to the history of eloquence, Cicero takes up again a doctrineof Hellenistic origin, according to which the evolution of all the artsmoves in the direction of the progressive acquisition of ‘naturalistic’rendering and toward the overcoming of archaic ‘harshness’ and‘rigidity.’ In Orator(168 ff.) this thesis is developed by affirming thatthe acquisition of the ‘naturalism’ of expression consists in knowinghow to modulate the rhythm of the language in a way that com-fortably fosters the progression of thought. For this reason, speechthat has overcome the harshness of its origins is structured in ‘peri-ods,’ which spontaneously seek concinnitas—symmetry of sounds andcadences. In other words, the prose of the orator is made numerosa(rhythmical) by not only the rhythm (numerus) in the proper, restrictedsense of the term, but—in addition to this—by the general symme-try and the manner in which the words are marshaled: the phrasemust give to the ear an impression of cohesion without dissonance,of smoothness devoid of harshness. In the name of this ‘naturalistic’requirement, Cicero recommends avoiding any forced transpositionof words, which smacks of artificiality, but also useless redundancies,the abuse of very short rhythms, which ‘enervates’ the style, or theexcessive repetition of the same clausula, which generates monotony.On the other hand, the comparison—introduced through the cita-tion of a few verses by Lucilius—of the period’s construction withthe art of mosaic (149) demonstrates how this ‘naturalism’ is in real-ity the result of meticulous and refined artistic effort. But the artificemust not be evident. Cicero explains that the audience would imme-diately notice the absence of rhythm if the one who is speakingshould not have recourse to it; nevertheless, if rhythm is presentwithout being too obvious, the orator will be able to achieve thedesired effect: the audience pays attention to the ideas that he devel-ops, and not to the rhythm in which these ideas are expressed.The refusal to dissimulate regarding rhetorical competencyThe passage that (functioning as a sort of ‘second prooemium’ ofOrator) introduces the highly specialized treatment of oratorical rhythmORATOR      437MAY_f15_426-443 7/11/02 8:56 PM Page 437"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"(numerus) takes on particular significance (140 ff.). Here, in a decisiveand explicit way, Cicero breaks with the tradition that demanded ofthe orator dissimulation regarding conscious techniques that he hadacquired: he confirms never having sought to conceal either his ownknowledge or the profit he realized from frequent contact with numer-ous teachers, both in the homeland and during his long study-tourin Greece and in Asia Minor.15By doing so, Cicero responds to theobjections of the many who still consider it unseemly for a senatorto squander his own time in the composition of rhetorical treatises,and who judge it just as unsuitable for him, during a period of retire-ment from public life, to have taken up giving instruction in elo-quence in his own house. According to his detractors, what Cicerois undertaking is entirely without precedent in Roman tradition,which, instead, has always practiced the private teaching of jurispru-dence. In his response, Cicero refuses to consider the mos maiorumascarrying absolute authority, and he attempts, on the other hand, tofind an ‘historical’ explanation for this discrepancy: in the practiceof jurisconsults, teaching came to coincide substantially with the sameactivity of providing responsa, while the orators of the past, engagedin the study of cases and in forensic debates, did not usually havetime for teaching, and often not even for their own personal exam-ination of the theoretical precepts of an art in which they allowedexperience, above all, to be their guide. A second objection regardsthe dignitasof teaching itself. Cicero replies that this argument hasvalidity in reference to one who gives lessons in a school,16but notso much for one who places himself at the disposal of young menand enables them to partake in the wealth of his own experienceand education by offering them advice and by helping them to cor-rect their own defects.The refusal to dissimulate about technical-rhetorical competency—traditionally practiced by previous orators—is obviously an essentialprerequisite for addressing openly the problem of the teaching of15The pivotal problems raised by this passage are not sufficiently placed in focusby the contribution of A. Novara, “La dignité de l’enseignement ou l’enseignementet le dialogue, d’après Cic., orat.144,” Annales Latini Montium Arvernorum10 (1983):35–52.16He must have been thinking primarily of the school of the so-called rhetoresLatini, opened in the late 90s B.C. by Plotius Gallus, and against which Crassusduring his censorship (De oratore3.93 ff.) had issued a decree of condemnation.Despite the decree of the censors, schools of this kind probably continued to prosper.438 MAY_f15_426-443 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 438"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"eloquence (in oral form or through treatises). It is thus indicativethat in this passage of Orator(146) Cicero tightly links the refusal—rather, the true and actual impracticality—of such a form of dis-simulation either with the cultural competence that his own eloquence,profoundly nurtured by the contributions of very diverse teachings,seems by this time to have induced in his audience, or with the widecirculation of the writtentexts of his oratory, already in themselvesindisputable proof of the vastness of their author’s intellectual inter-ests. We must not conceal the apparent incongruity represented bythe fact that this and other acknowledgments of the cultural recep-tivity of the public often are situated in a context wherein the authorfinds that he must defend the validity of his own intellectual engage-ment from a hostility that he presents as largely widespread. Thesetraditionalist-minded readers seem at times reluctant not only to rec-ognize the ‘intrinsic’ worth of learning, but also to appreciate itsfunction of nourishment and support for the activity of the oratoror the princeps civitatis. The circle from which this opposition comeswill be very probably the same against which Cicero also polemi-cizes elsewhere (for example, in the introduction to Book 1 of Definibusor to Book 2 of De officiis), by defending his own zeal forengaging in philosophy. Oddly, traces of this polemic do not seemto have been left in Cicero’s correspondence, which in other cases,on the contrary, informs us of the great success and widespread cir-culation of his works. On the other hand, our knowledge of thesociological composition of the Roman literary public is too uncer-tain and approximate to be able to identify the trends of its diversecomponents; but it is a probable assumption that in the late Republica vast differentiation existed: at Rome and in Italy the far-seeingintellectual openness of certain sections of the public was matchedby the closed, tenacious conservatism of others.Written and spoken oratoryWe have seen that in Brutus, and still more in Orator, Cicero ofteninsists that the criterion for measuring the quality of eloquence isbased on the force of the impact that it can exercise on the audience(even the employment of rhythm [numerus], which affects the ear, hasthe privilege of exerting this impact); the polemic against the Atti-cists pushes Cicero to place the experienced taste of competentORATOR      439MAY_f15_426-443 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 439"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"readers—the only ones capable of appreciating the very carefully mon-itored style of the Atticists—decisively on a second level. Still, thisdoes not cause Cicero to forget his role of having been, and of con-tinuing to be, the elaborator of a great literarystyle. During his entirelife, he had hoped through the publication of his orations either toinfluence the political direction of public opinion or to consolidatehis own reputation as an artist of speech among his contemporariesand among those who would follow him; the experience of watch-ing the words of the orators of the past slip away rapidly from thecollective memory had convinced him that the advocate, if he wantedto endure over time, must be transformed into a writer. On theother hand, the intention of conferring upon eloquence full literarydignity was part of the larger Ciceronian project of impressing uponhis fellow-citizens the undeniable worth of culture.Cicero is well aware of the fact that written orations are able torender only in part the powerful breath of actio (delivery), whereintruly the greatness of the orator is revealed (and thus in Orator, ashe had already done in De oratore, he dedicates several incisive pagesto actio—to the movement of the body, to gestures, to physical pos-ture). But Cicero had before him the negative model of highly effectivespeakers with a particularly stirring delivery (actio), such as ServiusSulpicius Galba, who, in committing their orations to writing, werenot able to find a form of expression adapted to rousing in thereader the emotions that they had known how to stir up in the lis-tener (Brutus92); and even Hortensius, in his judgment, had spokenmuch better than he had written (Orator132).Cicero, on the contrary, with the attentive care of the stylist, tookpains to preserve in the written version of his speeches as much ofthe movement and the vehemence of the spoken oration as possi-ble. In Orator(132) he intends to maintain that the simple readingofhis orations can adequately give an account of his ability to inflamethe spirit of his audience. More generally, the reference in Oratortowrittenoratory assumes a noteworthy importance, if as nothing elsebut the only possible evidence of what was delivered, for posterityand for a larger audience of contemporaries. In order to exemplifythe many varied aspects of the art of speaking (ars dicendi), Cicerorefers (as we have already seen) to the text of his own orations,widely circulated and accessible to all; he makes explicit referenceto the seven books of the Verrines, placing the five speeches of thesecond action, which were never actually delivered, on the same level440 MAY_f15_426-443 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 440"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"as the divinatioand the first action (103 ff.). At the conclusion of thework, he explicitly challenges the Atticists to write(and not deliver)something that really demonstrates the ability to stand in compari-son with the great eloquence of the Attic orators (235).On the other hand, it was not only a matter of bestowing on thetexts of the speeches a ‘spontaneous’ manner, which reflected thequality of the ‘spoken’ oration. Especially in the most elaborate pas-sages, the oratorical style of Cicero staked much on the rhythmicmanner of great, complex periods, on a redundancy (the so-calledcopia verborum) that permitted one to confirm, vary, and amplify ideasand formulations by charging them with resonances ever new. Thearchitecture of the period stood firm on the balance and harmonyof the phrases, on their correspondence, on a cadence wherein thepreoccupation for symmetry was counterbalanced by a desire not togenerate satiety and monotony. These artifices aimed at impressingthe words of the orator on the minds of those who were listeningto him; at prolonging the effect of those words by overcoming theephemeral evanescence of orality. It was a style that resolved toreach the heart through the ear, but one that, in order to be putin proper condition, demanded the frequent exercise of writing: anindispensable practice, in Cicero’s judgment, for one who intendedto make an attempt at eloquence. In Orator(200) Cicero explicitlyaffirms that, for copious breath and architectonic proportions, for thewell-calculated employment of rhetorical ornamentation, the phrasesof the orator must sound like written phrases; in fact, it is in thesethat the rhythmic qualities of eloquence are better revealed.Thus the delivered speech came to rely on procedures analogousto those of literary elaboration. However, the publication of speeches—other than meeting the necessity for political propaganda—respondedalso to the demand for models of eloquence from orators in for-mation, who were learning to speak by imitating the speeches thatthey had read.17In this way the procedures of writing resulted ineffectively influencing those of oral performance.In approaching the two, another factor then enters in. Even pri-vate reading, often practiced in a loud voice, or at least in a waythat made it possible to perceive distinctly the text by ear, involved17Cf. C. J. Classen, Recht—Rhetorik—Politik.

On one occa-sion, for example, Cicero represents one of his correspondents, MarcusMarius, as having had the text of some of his speeches read to himby a slave, who performed the function of a reader (anagnóstes; fam.7.1.3). This explains how Cicero, no differently than Isocrates, couldwrite for the ear more than for the eye of the reader. In a certainsense, the considerations that Aristotle had already applied to dra-matic poetry have validity for written oratory: ‘tragedy fulfills itsfunction even without acting, just as much as epic, and its qualitycan be gauged by reading aloud’ (Poetica1462a ff.).18BCritical Editions and Commentaries on OratorD’Arbela, E.

Cicero distances himself from the scheme of topics in Topicaby subsuming it under philosophical logic (6–7); likewise a reliance on sources issuggested by Cicero’s insistence that he composed Topicafrom memory, because hehad no access to books during the period of its composition (5).4Regarding the date of De inventioneI follow Kennedy (1972): 110.CHAPTER FIFTEENCICERO’S PARTITIONES ORATORIAEAND TOPICA:RHETORICAL PHILOSOPHY AND PHILOSOPHICAL RHETORICRobert N. GainesIntroductionCicero’s Partitiones oratoriaeand Topicaare frequently characterized asminor works in his rhetorical corpus.1There are obvious reasons forthis. Both are pedagogical works,2and both locate the authority fortheir contents in some measure apart from Cicero.3Nevertheless, Ido not believe it is difficult to show that Cicero had serious theo-retical intentions for the two treatises, and in the present essay, Ishall demonstrate that such intentions fit neatly within Cicero’s intel-lectual program on rhetoric.In developing this argument, I feature a matter of particular con-cern to Cicero, namely the relationship between rhetoric and phi-losophy. Originally, Cicero did not conceive philosophy as especiallygermane to rhetoric. In De inventione (c. 91–89 B.C.E.),4for example,MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 445"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"5This account may seem inconsistent with Inv. 1.1, where Cicero insists that foreloquence (eloquentia) to serve its possessor and the community, it must be combinedwith wisdom (sapientia). Certainly, some scholars have interpreted Cicero’s commentsas a recommendation for serious study of philosophy (see, e.g., Manfred Fuhrmann,Cicero und die römische Republik: eine Biographie. [München: Artemis Verlag 1989]:42–43). However, I do not believe that such an interpretation is necessary or evenwarranted, and I say this for two reasons. First, given an obvious opportunity,Cicero does not use the word ‘philosophy’ (philosophia) in discussing the kind of wis-dom that should be combined with eloquence; rather he refers to ‘the most rightand honorable pursuits of reason and duty’ (rectissimis atque honestissimis studiis ratio-nis et officii, G. Achard, ed., De l’invention/Cicéron, Collection des Universités de France,320 [Paris: Les Belles Lettres 1994]; here and elsewhere, English translations ofancient works are my own). Second, in offering his reflections on wisdom and elo-quence, Cicero almost certainly exploits a literary motif which dates from fifth orfourth century BCE and manifests no relation to disciplinary philosophy (see, e.g.,Anonymous Iamblichi, fr. 3, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, 7th ed., ed. Herman Dielsand Walther Kranz [Berlin: Weidmannsche Verlagsbuchhandlung 1954] 2: 401;Isoc. Antid. 253–57). Accordingly, in commending the combination of wisdom andeloquence at Inv. 1.1, Cicero simply upholds a traditional norm in the theory ofspeaking —the need for intellectual training and moral uprightness as well as elo-quence in the civic speaker. In my view, this norm is perfectly consistent with thegeneral separation of rhetoric from philosophy to which I refer in De inventione.6For a similar distinction and isolation of rhetoric from philosophy, see Rhetoricaad Herennium1.1 and 4.69. This work is roughly contemporary with De inventione,dating almost certainly from the early to middle 80s B.C.E. (Gualtiero Calboli, ed.and comm., Cornifici Rhetorica ad C. Herennium, 2nd ed. [Bologna: Pàtron 1993]:12–17).446 . he distinguished philosophical from rhetorical subject matters (1.8)and argued that speakers needed to know little philosophy in orderto master rhetoric (1.1, 33, 77, 86).5Moreover he recognized nodebt to philosophy, even when he exploited rhetorical theories ofphilosophers, because he thought that such theories fell outside thephilosophical discipline (2.8).6This early conception was profoundlyrevised in Cicero’s subsequent thinking. Specifically, from 55 B.C.E.onwards, we find Cicero arguing that philosophical subject mattersnecessarily belong to the speaker (De or. 1.56–57, 1.67–69, 3.122–124),that the speaker must know philosophy to achieve his rhetorical ends(De or. 1.53–54, 1.60; cf. 1.84), and finally, that speakers should turn to philosophy for theoretical principles on rhetoric (Or. 7–19;Part. 139–40;Fin. 4.5–6, 10;Brut. 120). In my view, this revisionrepresents Cicero’s realization that philosophy could contribute torhetorical theory in at least two ways: directly, through philosophi-cal inquiry into the nature of rhetoric, and indirectly, through theapplication to rhetoric of doctrines drawn from strictly philosophi-cal fields. Consistent with this view, I contend that Cicero constructedMAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 446"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Partitiones oratoriaeto represent philosophical inquiry into the natureof rhetoric or—as I shall call it—rhetorical philosophy. Likewise, Imaintain that Cicero constructed Topicato illustrate the applicationto rhetoric of philosophical doctrine or—in this instance—philo-sophical rhetoric. The presentation of my argument will require someattention to the contents of both works, Cicero’s comments in eachwork about what he is doing and why, and the intellectual context,especially as disclosed in Cicero’s rhetorical and extra-rhetorical works.To make the argument as clear as possible, I shall treat Partitionesoratoriaeand Topicaseparately.Partitiones oratoriaeAlthough the Ciceronian authorship of Partitiones oratoriaewas oncequestioned,7the work has been regarded as authentic since early inthe twentieth century.8The date of Partitiones oratoriaeis more trou-blesome; for, there are no clear indications of the time of composi-tion. The internal evidence most often noted as bearing upon thedate arises at Partitiones oratoriae1. Here Cicero’s son requests to hearin Latin what has been imparted in Greek by his father about thetheory of speaking. In reply, Cicero says that he has the time forthe discussion, now that he has been able to leave Rome, andexpresses keen interest in advancing his son’s education. Most com-mentators assume the circumstances depicted in these remarks arecurrently factual and, therefore, indicative of the time of composi-tion.9Based on this assumption, two standard proposals on the dateof Partitiones oratoriae have been put forward, 54–52 and 46–45 B.C.E.107Gaetano Curcio, Le opere retoriche di M. Tullio Cicerone. Studio critico(Acireale:Etna 1900): 201–19. Curcio (219) attributes first doubts about the authenticity ofPartitiones oratoriaeto Angelo Decembrio, De politia literaria libri septe[m], lib.

Moreover,Cicero’s letters, which demonstrate concern about Marcus’ educa-tion, represent ample motivation for writing such a book (e.g., Att.4.15.10 [54], 6.1.12 [50], 8.4.1 [49]). Finally, Partitiones oratoriaeexhibitsintellectual similarities to De oratore, written in 55, just prior to thedate proposed (e.g., compare Part. 53–54, 72 with De or.3.201,206–07). Defenders of 46–45 argue that the earlier date is unlikelybecause the historical Marcus would not have known Greek or stud-ied rhetoric as early as age eleven to thirteen. In favor of 46–45they argue that at this later date Partitiones oratoriae could have servedas a textbook for Pansa and Hirtius as well as the younger Cicero.Again, Partitiones oratoriaeexhibits intellectual similarities to Orator, awork written about the same time as the proposed date (e.g., com-pare Part. 53–54, 72 with Or. 92, 135). Further, Quintilian writes asif he believes Partititones oratoriaeis a late work of Cicero. And finally,46–45 seems a more appropriate time than 54–52 for Cicero to saythat he has now been able to leave Rome.Within the present essay, I shall adopt neither of the standardproposals regarding the date of Partititones oratoriae. I say this becausethere is little reason to grant their guiding assumption, that Partitionesoratoriae1 depicts a currently factual situation. Cicero’s dialoguebetween his son and himself almost certainly represents recourse toa Roman genre of technical prose literature.11This genre originatedwith M. Porcius Cato (234–149 B.C.E.), who addressed his son in oneor more compositions, probably concerning medicine, agriculture,29–32, and Karl Bayer and Gertrud Bayer, ed. and trans.,Partititones oratoriae: Rhetorikin Frage und Antwort.

Junius Brutus (fl. c. 140B.C.E.), whose De iure civili libri tres evidently comprised three dialogsin which Brutus and his son were the interlocutors.13Given this lit-erary context for Partitiones oratoriae, it is certainly imaginable thatCicero contrived a dialogue between himself and his son at a timeother than the dramatic date of the work. Moreover, it is hardlyobvious that Cicero meant for Partitiones oratoriaeto provide a theo-retical initiation to rhetoric for his son. And even if we grant filialpedagogy as an objective for the work, there are ancient precedentsfor the composition of simple rhetorical treatises to help advancedstudents review what they have already learned, and such a purposeis at least conceivable for Partitiones oratoriae.14Likewise, there existsan additional possibility, for which I shall argue shortly, that Cicero12Henricus Iordan, ed., M. Catonis praeter librum De re rustica quae extant(Lipsiae:In aedibus B. G. Teubneri 1860): 77–80, contemplates multiple compositions orga-nized as separate books and collected in a larger work entitled Ad Marcum filium.Consistent with this conception he tentatively assigns five Catonian fragments to abook De medicina(frs. 1–5), eight fragments to a book De agri cultura(frs. 6–13), andthree fragments to a book De rhetorica(frs. 14–16). Alan E. Astin, Cato the Censor(Oxford: Clarendon Press 1978), argues that the fragmentary evidence does not sup-port a multi-book work ad filium; rather ‘Cato addressed to his son a collection,probably in one book, of precepts, exhortations, instructions, and observations’ (339).Whichever of these theories is closer to the truth, there can be little dispute con-cerning whether Cato wrote preceptive, technical prose to his son, very likely con-cerning medicine, agriculture, and rhetoric. Of the sixteen fragments attributed byJordan to Ad Marcum filium, eleven offer explicit evidence that the discourse at stakein the fragment is addressed to Cato’s son (1–9, 12, and 14). Out of these elevenfragments, three make explicit reference to doctors or medical treatment (frs. 1–2,4), three deal quite unmistakably with farming (frs. 6, 8–9), and one offers a the-oretical definition of ‘the orator’ (fr. 14).13The evidence for a set of dialogs involving Brutus and his son arises from thenature of the three surviving fragments of De iure civili, each of which comes froma separate book and establishes a different dramatic situation involving the two men(Ph. Eduardo Huschke, ed., Iurisprudentiae anteiustinianae reliquias in usum maxime academi-cum, 6th ed., edited by E. Seckel et B. Kuebler [Lipsiae: In aedibus B. G. Teubneri1908] 1:7 [= Cic.

For the pre-sent, then, because we need not assume the dramatic circumstancesof dialog in Partitiones oratoriaeare factual, there is no compulsion toaccept either of the dates usually offered for the work. Fortunately,my account of Cicero’s theoretical aim in Partitiones oratoriaedoes notdepend upon a particular date of composition; in fact, for reasonsthat will become clear, almost any date during Cicero’s maturity willserve as well as another. More important are the rhetorical princi-ples communicated in the work and the intellectual orientation thatCicero expresses toward them. I now turn to these matters.15Partitiones oratoriaedivides the theory of speaking into parts con-cerned with the power of the speaker, the speech, and the question(3–4).16Power of the speaker is discussed mainly with reference tofunctional activities of speakers: invention, arrangement, expression,delivery, and memory (5–26). Invention (5–8) is characterized as pro-ducing conviction and arousing audience emotions (5), but treatmentof emotion is postponed until later in the treatise (8). Conviction isdescribed as arising from arguments derived from topics in two cat-egories. One category—testimonies—is extrinsic to the subject of thespeech and derived from divine and human sources. Divine testi-monies include oracles, auspices, prophecies, and responses of priests,augurs, and diviners, whereas human testimonies are drawn fromauthority, inclination, and speech, both voluntary and compelled, aswell as written documents, agreements, promises, oaths, and inquiries(6). The other category is intrinsic to the subject of the speech; intrin-15I hope I will be forgiven for a lengthy summary of Partitiones oratoriae. I amled to provide such a summary because there is currently no account of the workin English that is sufficiently detailed to support a theoretical discussion.

To con-clude the account of invention, Cicero notes that not all topics arerelevant to all circumstances (8).The account of arrangement proposes different principles depend-ing upon whether the subject is general or particular, and when itis particular, depending upon the nature of the audience (9–15).Where speeches involve general or unlimited questions, arrangementof materials is nearly the same as the order of topics in Cicero’sexposition under invention (9). However, where speeches involve par-ticular or limited questions, arrangement must employ means of excit-ing audience emotions (9). Particular questions are divided into threetypes based on the nature of the audience. Some audiences are mereauditors, while others are judges of the future or the past (10). Formere auditors the speech is concerned with embellishment and aimsat pleasure; accordingly Cicero details five pleasant methods ofarrangement—chronological, distributive, ascending, descending, andirregular (11–12). Speeches to judges of the future concern deliber-ation and attempt to create hope or fear; they frequently omit intro-ductions and narrations and focus on confirmation and emotionallyaffecting perorations (11, 13). Judges of the past are addressed byspeeches concerned with judgment and designed to create severityor clemency (11). Prosecutors follow the order of facts in narration,state and confirm their arguments with vehemence and elaborationfor emotional effect, then arouse more emotion, especially anger, inthe peroration (14). Defenders secure good will with introductions,use narrations sparingly, rebut or obscure the prosecutor’s arguments,and arouse pity in the peroration (15).Expression is conceived as either spontaneous or inverted (16,23–24). Both forms use single words and combined words as resources.Single words are natural or discovered (16) and otherwise distin-guished by their inherent sonority, grandeur, smoothness, and pol-ish, or by their use, whether proper, added, new, old, or altered(17). Combinations of words aim at rhythm, which is judged by theear, and sequence, which is judged by the rules of grammar (18).Single words and their combinations are described by Cicero ascapable of five qualities: lucidity, brevity, credibility, brilliance, andcharm (19–22).    451MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 451"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"Delivery and memory are very briefly treated. Cicero notes thatdelivery must correspond to the things and words that occupy thespeaker in the speech. In particular, the speaker must use variationsin voice, gesture, and visage to render the speech lucid, brilliant,credible, and charming (25). Memory is abstractly sketched as a struc-ture that involves ‘locations’ where mental pictures are stored foruse by the speaker (26).The second part of the theory of speaking —the speech—is orga-nized around four speech parts, introduction, narration, proof, andperoration (27–60). Cicero observes that, generally, introduction andperoration are for arousing emotion, while narration and proof arefor securing belief. Nonetheless, he notes that amplification—chiefspur of the passions—is useful in all speech parts (27). Introductions,he says, typically treat persons and things connected to the speechin order to secure a friendly, intelligent, and attentive hearing (28–30).The narration explicates the facts at stake in securing belief, so itmust exhibit lucidity, brevity, and credibility as essential features (31).Lucidity and brevity are dispensed with as matters of expressionalready treated. Credibility is described as arising partly in relationto the matter at issue and partly from the manifest character of thespeaker (32). Finally, to lucidity, brevity, and credibility, Ciceroencourages the addition of charm by evoking surprise and suspenseand by depicting human interaction and emotion (32).Cicero’s main interest in connection with the speech is proof orsecuring belief, and this he divides into confirmation and refutation.Confirmation always relates to whether something is, what it is, orwhat is its quality; therefore, he allocates his comments on confirmationto the methods associated with these issues—conjecture, definition,and justification (33). Conjecture is based on probabilities and signs.In regard to probabilities Cicero presents topics derived from whathe calls ‘parts of the narration,’ namely persons, places, times, andactions and occurrences (34). Each part is described as having twosorts of characteristics, one sort determined by nature or delibera-tion and the other by accident or inadvertence. In the case of per-sons, there are natural characteristics of body and mind. Physicalcharacteristics include health, figure, powers, age, and gender; men-tal characteristics include virtues, vices, and affection by emotions.Accidental characteristics of persons are family, friends, children, rel-atives, in-laws, resources, honors, powers, wealth, independence andtheir opposites (35). Regarding places, natural characteristics relate452 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 452"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"to coastal proximity, slope, ruggedness, healthfulness, and exposureto sun; accidental characteristics relate to cultivation, population,development, notoriety, and religious significance (36). Natural timesinclude present, past, and future as well as season, month, day, night,and hour. Accidental times include sacrifices, feast days, and nup-tials (37). Actions and occurrences are deliberate or inadvertent.Deliberate actions and occurrences relate to good and evil, of whichthere are three kinds, mental, physical, and external. Inadvertentactions and occurrences arise by necessity, by accident, or by stir-ring of the mind through emotion (38). The handling of signs is lessextensive. Cicero appears to distinguish necessary from inconclusivesigns, but he only discusses the latter, calling them vestiges of actions,including a weapon, blood, clamor, hesitancy, change of color, agi-tated speech, tremor, and the like (39–40).Definition is elucidated by Cicero as a set of topical strategies forarguing that something is of a certain sort. He includes two modesof defining that rely on properties peculiar to the thing defined,namely definition from genus combined with a special property anddefinition from a special property among common attributes. However,he observes that disagreements frequently arise about special prop-erties of things. Accordingly, he offers six alternative modes of defining:definition from contraries, dissimilarities, similarities, characterizingdescriptions, enumerations of consequences, and explanations of aword or name (41).The treatment of justification offers general topics for arguingabout the quality of an act. It can be argued that the deed wasrightly done to avert or avenge pain, for the sake of piety, chastity,reverence, or patriotism, or because of necessity, ignorance, or acci-dent (42). All these topics are applicable to legal proceedings as wellas free debate. However, in free debate, it may also be argued thatan act was performed irrationally from emotion or mental distur-bance (43).Regarding refutation, Cicero raises two main strategies: denial ofeverything in an opponent’s argument, proving it is fictitious or false;or rebuttal of an opponent’s assumptions, proving they are doubtfulor inconclusive or invalid (44). This leads to discussion of argumentitself, and Cicero distinguishes six modes of development. The directlogical mode convinces, while the indirect logical mode excites emo-tions (46). Four other modes exploit forms of expression—question-ing oneself, interrogating, commanding, and wishing (47).

However, he discusses only the evidenceof witnesses and, at that, only the topics to be used in argumentagainst voluntary testimony and examination under torture (49–51).Concerning the final speech part, peroration, Cicero says that itis divided into two elements, amplification and recapitulation (52).Amplification is designed to arouse emotions and is accomplishedwith regard to words and things (53–58). Recapitulation is used torefresh the audience’s memory or strengthen the case. Cicero sug-gests that recapitulation is required sometimes in laudatory speeches,seldom in deliberation, and more often for prosecutors than defen-dants in judicial speeches (59–60).The third part of the theory of speaking is the question or thatmatter concerning which there is discussion or dispute (61–138). HereCicero reiterates a distinction made earlier between questions thatare limited and those that are unlimited; he also adds two doctrines.The first is that any discussion of an unlimited question is really apart of a dispute concerning a limited question (61). The second isthat unlimited questions are of separate kinds which aim either atknowledge or at action (62). Unlimited questions related to knowl-edge are concerned with reality, definition, and quality (62–66).Unlimited questions related to action pertain to instruction in dutiesand to calming and arousing emotions (67). Finally, Cicero notesthat discourses on unlimited questions are arranged using the sametheory exposed in previous divisions of the treatise (68).Next come limited questions, which Cicero divides into types con-cerned with embellishment and proof. The embellishing-type is widelydifferentiated, so Cicero selects one kind as an epitome, that whichpraises and blames. The proving-type is itself divided into two kinds,envisioning the future or deliberative speaking, and judging the pastor judicial speaking (69–70). The remainder of the treatise is devotedto these three kinds of speaking (praise and blame, 70–82; deliber-ative, 83–97; judicial, 98–138).Praising and blaming, Cicero explains, generally consist in recount-ing and amplifying past actions in a style designed gently to influenceaudience emotions (71–73). The typical speech of praise or blame isorganized according to classes of things good and evil, beginningwith external properties, continuing with physical properties, andconcluding with mental properties, especially insofar as these arerelated to virtues or vices (74–75). This leads to a treatment of virtues454 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 454"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"and vices. Virtues, like general questions, are divided into mattersof knowledge and action. In the former class, Cicero places pru-dence, shrewdness, and wisdom (76, 78–79); in the latter, he placestemperance, greatness of mind, justice, reverence, respect, goodness,fidelity, mercy, and friendship (76–78). As a kind of appendix, Ciceroadds a set of public and private virtues associated with preparationin proper studies and arts (80). Vices exist in classes that are oppo-site to virtues; accordingly, they receive no special treatment (81).Deliberative speaking is described by Cicero as turning upon twoissues, advantage and feasibility. Speech on behalf of a proposal, hesays, must prove that the proposal is both advantageous and feasi-ble; however, speech against a proposal need only refute the attri-bution of one or the other property (83–85). Accordingly, Ciceroproceeds to a topical analysis of advantage and feasibility. Advantageis loosely associated with goods, and these are classified as necessaryor unnecessary (86–92). Concerning feasibility, Cicero notes it is mostuseful to understand causes—both efficient and indispensable—of theends in view (93–95). Ultimately Cicero posits that speakers for andagainst deliberative proposals use identical topics (95), and he offersboth sorts of speakers advice about managing audience emotions inintroductions and perorations (96–97).Cicero’s account of judicial speaking is driven by the disputes thatmay logically arise in court cases.17He begins by discussing argu-ments that are possible before, and sometimes during the trial—ateither time a defendant may challenge the standing of the prosecu-tor, the jurisdiction of the court, or the fairness of the proceedings(99–100). Within the trial, the possible arguments are analyzed accord-ing to stances available to defendants in combating a charge, namely,disputing the action alleged through conjecture; disputing the nameof the action alleged through definition; and disputing the quality ofthe action alleged through equity (101–02). Cicero explains that thesestances relate to the elements of a legal case: the prosecutor’s accu-sation, the defendant’s defense and rationale, the prosecutor’s basesfor opposing the rationale, and the point of contention arising fromconflict between the defendant’s rationale and the prosecutor’s bases17This discussion represents one version of the rhetorical theory of status (Greekstasis), an account of possible argumentative positions, especially in regard to court-room speaking; for a treatment of the origins of the theory, see Kennedy (1963):305–14.    455MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 455"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"(102–06). He also explains that stances on limited cases sometimeslead to arguments of an unlimited nature (106) or based on disputesover documents (107–08). However, he mainly attends to argumen-tative topics for cases founded on conjecture, definition, or equity.Conjecture receives the most extensive treatment, and the resourcesof the prosecutor are presented first. Cicero notes that the principallines of argument concern cause and effect (110). Under cause ormotive, he places all the deliberative topics, because these relate toadvantage and feasibility of any action, whether future or past(110–11). To complete the account of motive, he adds that emo-tions can bear on a case (112):. . . if there is recent anger, old hatred, eagerness for vengeance, indig-nation from injury, desire for honor, glory, power, or wealth, fear ofdanger, debt, dearth of property; if a man is daring, weak, savage,impetuous, unwary, foolish, amorous, frenzied, intoxicated; has hopeof succeeding, has expectation of concealing, or if he is exposed, <hasexpectation> of repelling accusation or overcoming danger or defer-ring <danger> for a long time; or if the penalty of the verdict is lighterthan the benefit of the act; or if the pleasure of misdeed is greaterthan the pain of condemnation.As regards effect or outcome, Cicero discusses signs that provide ves-tiges of guilty deeds, for example, a weapon, blood, something appar-ently stolen, hesitation, pallor, tremor, appearance at the crime scene,and written documents (114). He concludes the prosecutor’s conjec-tural case with constructive lines of reasoning about witnesses, bothvoluntary and involuntary (117–18). The defendant’s case is alsodescribed with reference to cause and effect. In connection withcause, arguments are designed to show the defendant lacked sufficientmotives, means, or opportunity to commit the act (119). Likewise,the defendant attempts to overturn arguments from effect by ques-tioning signs that could arise in the absence of a crime, offeringalternative explanations of actions, or asserting that signs attachequally to the prosecutor. Finally, the defendant answers the prose-cutor’s reasoning about witnesses with opposite reasoning (120). Atthe end, Cicero reviews how prosecutors and defendants make bestuse of the four speech parts in the conjectural case (121–22).Definition is characterized as involving the explanation and scrutinyof a term, and Cicero demonstrates the common resources for pros-ecutor and defendant (123–24). Among these he recommends thetopics of general usage, intention of the law, equity, advantage, inclu-456 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 456"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"sion, contrary, original sense, precedent, limited jeopardy, parallel,and example (124–26). He also notes two further approaches: pros-ecutors can complain that defendants try to escape by interpretinga word, and defendants can complain that prosecutors accuse by dis-torting a word. In connection with these approaches, Cicero men-tions the relevance of ‘most of the topics of invention,’ and heexplicitly cites similarities, contraries, and consequents (127). To con-clude the account, Cicero recommends amplification in perorationsof definitional cases to stir emotions in the judges (128).Cases founded on equity admit an action that is ordinarily cen-surable, but claim the actor was right in doing the deed. Cicero con-ceptualizes equity as concerned with human right by nature and bylaw, where law is either (a) written and public or private or (b)unwritten and customary or consensual (129–30). Cicero sums upthe case founded on equity with a formula: ‘If a man unintention-ally or by necessity or by accident has done something, which wasnot permitted of those who had done it of their own will and vol-untarily, he should seek pardon drawn from very many topics ofequity in a plea for forgiveness of his act’ (131).As a final comment on judicial speaking, Cicero returns to thematter of disputes over documents as the foundation for a case. Henotes that the principles of documentary dispute are common toboth sides of a litigation (132). He then provides distinctive topicsfor two circumstances, one where a document is ambiguous (132–33),the other where an author’s intended meaning is apparently at oddswith the author’s written words (133–37). He also entertains a thirdcircumstance, where two documents are in conflict, but insists thattopics for this circumstance are completely supplied by the combi-nation of topics provided for the other two circumstances (137–38).Cicero concludes Partitiones oratoriaewith a disclosure and an admo-nition (139): ‘All the divisions of oratory have been explained to you,at any rate those which sprang from the midst of our Academy, andnot without the aid of this <school of philosophy> can they be dis-covered or understood or practiced.’ The disclosure attributes theorigins of Cicero’s discussion to the Academy, while the admonitionmakes Academic philosophy a prerequisite to its successful applica-tion. Cicero explains the reach of his admonition in the materialsthat immediately follow. Proficiency in oratory requires the abilityto divide concepts, define and distinguish meanings, invent anddevelop arguments, judge inferences, and express the whole as would    457MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 457"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"a dialectician or an orator (139). It also presupposes knowledge ofgood and bad, right and wrong, utility and disutility, as well as virtueand vice (140). Thus, according to Cicero’s admonition, all thesematters must be acquired from the pursuit of Academic philosophy.Now, in light of the foregoing, I believe there are several signsthat Cicero constructed Partitiones oratoriaeas a representation of rhetor-ical philosophy. Most obvious is Cicero’s assertion that the divisionsof oratory explicated in the work arose in the Academy (139). Thereis good reason to take this assertion very seriously as a kind of sourceattribution.18Throughout his intellectual maturity, Cicero affiliatedhimself with the Academic School.19In this connection, he knew thatthe Academy had incorporated rhetoric into its philosophical system(Acad. 1.30–32; cf. 1.19).20He also knew that Academics had offeredspecific instruction in rhetoric; in fact, he had attended lectures byPhilo on rhetoric (Tusc. 2.9) and felt qualified to comment on thesubstance of Philo’s instruction (De or. 3.110). Perhaps as much asanyone, then, Cicero was in a position to discuss rhetoric as con-ceived in Academic philosophy. Accordingly, when he asserts that18Cf. Wilhelm Kroll, “M.

Hakkert 1989):172–73.19There is controversy concerning whether Cicero affiliated himself with the skep-tical and dogmatic Academies at different times. Recently, John Glucker, “Cicero’sPhilosophical Affiliations,” The Question of “Eclecticism.” Studies in Later Greek Philosophy,John M. Dillon and A. A. Long, eds.

Fortenbaugh and PeterSteinmetz, eds. (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers 1989): 1–22, have arguedthat Cicero changed his Academic affiliation twice—from skepticism to dogmatismand back to skepticism. The traditional view is that Cicero was unswerving in hisallegiance to skeptical Academic philosophy (bibliography in Steinmetz (1989): 19–21,n. 1); this view is defended against Glucker and Steinmetz by Woldemar Görler,“Silencing the Troublemaker: De LegibusI.39 and the Continuity of Cicero’s Scepticism,”Cicero the Philosopher, J. G. F. Powell, ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1995): 85–113.Whichever view is correct, there is no question that Cicero would have countedhimself as an adherent to Academic philosophy throughout his adulthood.20On this point, see Jonathan Barnes, “Logic in AcademicaI and the Lucullus,”Assent and Argument.

[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1977] [= SB]; for pur-poses of exposition traditional references to book, letter, and paragraph in Fam. arealso included). The fact that Cicero uses the same language in these two attribu-tions suggests that he conceives the Academy as a source in roughly the same wayfor both works. Now, because we know that the books of the Academicaare drawnfrom Academic philosophy even in their particulars, it seems reasonable to con-clude that much the same is true of Partitiones oratoriae. What Cicero means by the‘Academy’ in Part. 139 is complex for two reasons. First, for Cicero, Academic phi-losophy includes doctrines from both the Old (dogmatic) Academy and the New(skeptical) Academy (a distinction which Cicero observes and explicates, see, e.g.,Leg. 1.38–39; Acad. 1.13, 1.46, Fin. 5.7; Off. 3.20; cf. De or. 3.67). Second, in Cicero’sview, Academic philosophy also incorporates doctrines from the early Peripatos,because—as he says—the early Peripatos and the Old Academy agreed in sub-stance, though they differed in terminology (e.g., Leg. 1.38, Fin. 4.5; cf. Luc. 15).Thus, in citing the Academy as the source for Partitiones oratoriae, Cicero allows him-self free access to a wide range of intellectual resources, particularly philosophicaldoctrines from the Old Academy of Plato and Crates, the early Peripatos of Aristotleand Theophrastus, the New Academy of Arcesilaus and Philo, and the regenerateOld Academy of Antiochus; cf. Karl Wilhelm Piderit, comm., Ciceros Partitiones ora-toriae(Leipzig: B. G. Teubner 1867): 91.22Consistent with Cicero’s complex conception of the Academy, I believe thisconclusion is coherent with standard proposals regarding the provenance of Partitionesoratoriae, at least insofar as such proposals indentify sources for elements of the workin the ancient Peripatos, e.g., Robert Philippson, “M. Tullius Cicero (PhilosophischeSchriften),” Paulys Real-Encyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, Neue Bearbeitung,Reihe 2, Bd. 7, Teil 1, col. 1121 [Aristotle]; the New Academy, e.g., FredericusMarx, ed., Incerti auctoris De ratione dicendi ad C.

However, thereare three characteristics of the work that would appear to count notonly against such a design, but in favor of the work’s representingrhetorical philosophy. First, as mentioned above, Partitiones oratoriaedivides the whole theory of speaking into three parts: power of thespeaker, the speech, and the question. This structure is not explic-itly employed or fully realized in any other ancient discussion ofrhetoric.23Hence, Cicero’s recourse to this division in Partitiones ora-toriae constitutes a departure from his own theoretical predilectionsas well as the standard structures for rhetorical theory established inancient times.24The upshot is that such an eccentric theoretical struc-ture would be an unlikely choice for Cicero to make in the earlyrhetorical instruction of young Marcus, particularly since Cicero neverused the structure in works avowedly his own. At the same time, atheoretical structure out of the mainstream of standard rhetoric wouldseem almost to be expected if the work represented independentrhetorical thought from a philosophical school.25Second, Partitiones oratoriaeenvisions independent discourses onunlimited matters and furnishes special principles for the construc-tion of such discourses (5–9).26This characteristic again places thework at odds with Cicero and the standard tradition. In fact, betweenCicero and traditional rhetorical authors, there were four typicalapproaches to unlimited matters, not one of which featured special23Cf. Wisse (1989): 172.24There were five configurations of ancient manuals that attempted to treatrhetoric systematically: (1) quantitative—organized according to speech parts; (2)generic—organized according to speech kinds; (3) functional—organized accordingto speaker activities; (4) conjunctive—unintegrated combinations of (1), (2), and (3);and (5) conflative—integrated combinations of (1) and (3) (Gaines [1989]: 335–37).Partitiones oratoriaeis a conjunctive treatise. Among Cicero’s other systematic works,De inventionerepresents the conflative configuration, while De oratoreand Oratorrep-resent the functional configuration. Outside of Cicero’s works, extant treatises upto late first century B.C.E. may be classified as follows: Aristotle’s Rhetoric(functional),Anaximenes’ Rhetorica ad Alexandrum(generic), and Cornificius’ Rhetorica ad Herennium(conflative). After Partitiones oratoriae, the first systematic discussion of rhetoric knownto exhibit the conjunctive configuration is De rhetoricain Martianus Capella’s De nup-tiis Philologiae et Mercurii(5th century C.E.; cf. Karl Barwick, “Die Gliederung derrhetorischen T°xnhund die horazische Epistula ad Pisones,” Hermes57 [1922]: 2;Friedrich Solmsen, “The Aristotelian Tradition in Ancient Rhetoric,” American Journalof Philology62 [1941]: 50).25See Wisse (1989): 172–73.26Cf.

Inv. 1.8; Hermagoras [perhaps the student of Theodorusof Gadara]28in Quint. Inst. 2.21.22, 3.5.14). Another silently ignoredthe issue and treated only limited matters (e.g., Cornif. Rhet. Her.1.2). A third approach classified unlimited matters as subordinate tolimited matters, thus ruling out unlimited matters as subjects for inde-pendent speaking (e.g., Cic. Or. 45–46, 125–26; Top. 80; Athenaeusin Quint. Inst. 3.5.5). Finally, a fourth approach embraced indepen-dent discourses on unlimited matters, but neglected or refused tooffer special precepts for their composition (e.g., Cic. De or.2.65–70).29Our evidence, then, is that Cicero and traditional authors generallyomitted special precepts on unlimited discourses from their rhetori-cal works (Cic. De or. 2.65; 2.78; 3.110).30Accordingly, it seems fairto ask why Cicero would insert such precepts into an introductorytextbook. Cicero personally disagreed with the idea, and he wouldcertainly have realized the difficulties posed for the beginning stu-dent by a doctrine that was alien to standard instruction in rhetor-ical theory. My contention is that there is no plausible explanationfor the insertion, if we maintain the assumption that Cicero com-posed Partitiones oratoriaeto introduce the principles of rhetoric to hisson. The situation is quite different if we assume the work wasdesigned to represent philosophical inquiry into rhetoric—particu-larly from the Academic perspective. I say this because we know—from Cicero himself—that training for composition of independentdiscourses on unlimited matters was an essential part of advanced27I do not mean for this claim to extend beyond rhetorical theory per se. Theelementary composition exercise known as thesis, or theme on a general matter,was apparently a fixture in the Greek and Roman educational curricula of the lateHellenistic era (see, e.g., Stanley F. Bonner, Education in Ancient Rome: From the ElderCato to the Younger Pliny[Berkeley: University of California Press 1977]: 270–72).However, practice in composition was generally considered a preliminary for tech-nical instruction in rhetoric (Quint. Inst. 2.1.1–13; 2.10.1), accordingly, along withother forms of practice in composition, thesis was not treated in books limited torhetorical theory (Quint. Inst. 2.11.1).28This is the suggestion of Dieter Matthes, “Hermagoras von Temnos 1904–1955,”Lustrum3 (1958): 101 n. 7.29Cf. Anton D. Leeman, Harm Pinkster, and H. L. W.

Therefore, itwould be quite natural for an Academic treatise on the theory ofspeaking to provide precepts for independent speech-making on unlim-ited matters—it was a routine part of school instruction.The third characteristic of Partitiones oratoriaeis that it does notpresent a single, coherent theory of rhetoric; rather it presents threedistinguishable theories. On account of its tripartite structure, thereis considerable repetition of theoretical materials within Partitionesoratoriaeas a whole. This repetition allows comparative analysis ofmaterials in corresponding parts, and even a cursory comparisondemonstrates that the three divisions of Partitiones oratoriaemanifestimportant theoretical diversities. For instance, the division on the‘power of the orator’ diverges from the divisions on ‘the speech’ and‘the question’ in the way that it conceptualizes inherent or artistictopics for producing conviction in discourses on limited matters.Specifically, the division on ‘power of the orator’ sets down sixteeninherent topics (7) which are evidently logical and very abstract.31These topics are quite different from corresponding topics in thedivisions on ‘the speech’ (33–44) and ‘the question’ (70–138); for thelatter are more specific, more numerous, and divided into categoriesbased either on the argumentative functions in a rhetorical case(confirmation, 33–43; refutation, 44) or on the classification of rhetor-ical cases (demonstrative, 70–82; deliberative, 83–97; judicial, 98–117,119–38). An example of how the divisions on ‘the speech’ and ‘thequestion’ are theoretically distinct may be seen in the way they con-ceptualize argumentative topics for the conjectural judicial matter.The division on ‘the speech’ treats the conjectural matter (34–40)as part of the general discussion of confirmation in speeches, but itis clear from the context of the discussion that the topics treated aremeant for judicial application.32Within the treatment, conjecture isanalyzed with reference to probabilities and signs; topics for proba-bility are subsumed under four ‘parts of the narration,’ persons,places, times, and actions and occurrences (34–38), while topics for31Cf. Wisse (1989): 138.32At times the discussion of confirmation assumes that a past action is the sub-ject matter of the speech under consideration (Part. 39, 43). Moreover, near theend of his comments on ‘the speech,’ Cicero makes it explicit that the account ismeant to guide all three kinds of speaking, laudatory, deliberative, and judicial(58–59).462 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 462"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"signs are explicated in large part as vestiges of actions (39). Thetreatment of conjectural judicial matters in the division on ‘the ques-tion’ is rather different; in fact, it accounts for the topics of conjec-ture under two main concepts—causes and results—and divides thediscussion between resources for the prosecutor (causes, 110–13;results, 114) and for the defender (causes, 119; results, 120). In con-sequence of diversities such as the foregoing (and there are others),the same speaker in identical circumstances could easily producethree quite different speeches by closely following precepts in therespective divisions of Partitiones oratoriae. Accordingly, the divisions ofPartitiones oratoriaeprovide rhetorical principles with different condi-tions of satisfaction in practice, and for this reason they present dis-tinct rhetorical theories.33The significance of multiple theories in Partitiones oratoriaeis thatit makes the work unsuitable for early instruction in rhetoric. Surelythe beginning student is not prepared to absorb conflicting adviceon the same issues and problems—particularly when the conflictsare not highlighted and explicated, as they are in De oratore.34Thus,it seems unlikely that Cicero conceived Partitiones oratoriaeas a meansof initiating his son into the rhetorical discipline. Of course it is quitereasonable to ask how the presentation of multiple theories in Partitionesoratoriaemakes it more likely that the work represents rhetoricalinquiry in the Academy. The answer, I believe, has to do withAcademic epistemology. The Academic school—at least a significantgroup of its skeptical adherents—conceived that infallible knowledgewas impossible and that the conduct of life as well as philosophicalinquiry could be regulated by what was plausible (Cic. Luc. 32, 99;N.D. 1.12; Off. 2.7).35One consequence of such skepticism was thatdiverse accounts of the same matter could be entertained as plausi-ble within the school (Cic. Or. 237; Luc. 99; Tusc. 5.11, 5.32–33,33I am proposing non-identical conditions of satisfaction in practice as a sufficientcondition, not a necessary condition, for distinguishing rhetorical theories.34On this point, see James M. May and Jakob Wisse, trans., Cicero On the IdealOrator (De Oratore)(Oxford: Oxford University Press 2001): 16.35See, e.g., Jonathan Barnes, “Antiochus of Ascalon,” in Philosophia Togata: Essayson Philosophy and Roman Society, Miriam Griffin and Jonathan Barnes, eds.

Hence, the presentation of multiple rhetorical theories inPartitiones oratoriae coheres with—perhaps even suggests—the idea thatCicero designed the work to represent rhetorical inquiry in theAcademic school.37My argument to this point may be summarized as follows. Ciceroasserts that Partitiones oratoriaederives from the Academic school ofphilosophy. He also constructs the treatise in ways that indicate hisaim is to delineate philosophical inquiry into rhetoric and not todeliver introductory instruction in the rhetorical art. Accordingly, myconclusion is that Cicero’s central purpose in composing Partitionesoratoriaewas to represent rhetorical philosophy in the Academy. Tothe extent that this conclusion is acceptable, I would suggest thatthe context which surrounds the dating of Partitiones oratoriaeis nec-essarily changed. In fact, understanding the work as a representa-tion of rhetorical philosophy opens up the range of possible datesconsiderably. I say this in part because Cicero might have conceivedsuch an objective at almost any time after his first encounter withAcademic inquiry into rhetoric in the early 80s (Tusc. 2.9, Brut. 306).Of course, the genre of the work strongly commends a compositiondate sometime after Marcus’s birth in 65; but given a theoreticalobjective for Partitiones oratoriae, the date of the work need not beconstrained by practical details in the education Marcus or anyoneelse. This is not to deny that the work might have been composedduring Marcus’s childhood, perhaps in anticipation of a time in whichit might be useful to him. Neither does it rule out the possibilitythat the work served as a kind of advanced epitome of rhetoric foryoung Marcus or Hirtius and Pansa in the early to middle 40’s. The36On this point see John Glucker, “Probabile, Veri Simile, and Related Terms,” inCicero the Philosopher, J. G. F. Powell, ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1995): 135–36;cf. Klaus Bringmann, Untersuchungungen zum späten Cicero, Hypomnemata: Untersuchungenzur Antike und zu ihrem Nachleben, 29 (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht1971): 88–89.37One advantage of the conjunctive organizational scheme is that it permits rep-resentation of diverse theoretical perspectives within the framework of a single trea-tise. See Solmsen (1941): 50, on Martianus Capella’s exploitation of this advantagein De rhetorica.464 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 464"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"point is that to achieve its theoretical goal, the work need not haveserved a special instructional purpose of any sort; therefore, such apurpose cannot provide a defensible foundation for the date of thework. Neither—in my view—can the time of composition be lim-ited through recourse to datable doctrines in Cicero’s rhetoricalthought. For presuming only that Cicero was faithful to the task ofrepresenting Academic rhetoric in the work, his project would havebeen to preserve Academic achievements in the discipline with fidelity.In pursuit of such a project, Cicero would surely have suppressedhis own positions in favor of Academic views. Accordingly, when wefind in Partitiones oratoriaedoctrines with parallels in De oratore, Orator,and Topica, we cannot assume that such doctrines represent Ciceronianinnovations imported into Partitiones oratoriaefrom these works or theirdates of composition. Rather, if we are to make any inference atall, we must count such doctrines as signs of Academic influence onCicero’s mature rhetorical corpus. Likewise, when we do not find inPartitiones oratoriaeany mention of an issue eventually important toCicero, for example, Atticism, we cannot assume Partitiones oratoriaewas written before such matters loomed large in Cicero’s thinking.The theoretical object of Partitiones oratoriaewould surely have pre-cluded inclusion of intellectual issues not addressed in the Academicschool. Thus, the omission of such issues has no inherent value asevidence for a composition date of the work. Finally, the view thatPartitiones oratoriaerepresents Academic philosophy permits us to extendpossible composition dates somewhat later into Cicero’s literary career.At De divinatione2.1–4 Cicero discusses his philosophical writings,among which are included three works that he says join rhetoricwith philosophy, namely De oratore, Brutus, and Orator. The absenceof Partitiones oratoriaefrom this list is conspicuous, and I think thatthere are at least two conceivable explanations. The first is thatCicero placed in the list only works that both joined rhetoric andphilosophy and expressed his personal views. Consistent with thisexplanation, Partitiones oratoriaewould not have been a candidate forthe list, inasmuch as it reflected rhetorical theory of the Academy,not Cicero. Thus, whether Partitiones oratoriaepre-existed De divinatione2 or not, it would in no case have appeared in the list. The secondexplanation is that Cicero placed in the list simply all of his worksthat joined rhetoric and philosophy. In line with this explanation,Cicero would have omittedPartitiones oratoriaeonly if it had not been    465MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 465"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"composed by the date of De divinatione2.38Now, I believe there isno decisive way of rejecting either of these explanations. For thisreason, I would propose, we cannot rule out a date for Partitionesoratoriaethat comes later than the completion of De divinatione2, thatis, sometime after mid-March 44.39Thus, in line with the conclu-sion that Partitiones oratoriaerepresents rhetorical philosophy, we areconfronted with possible dates of the work extending from 65 to atleast 44.TopicaThe authenticity and date of Topicaare not matters of dispute. Ciceromentions Topica in a dedicatory letter written to Trebatius fromRhegium, dated 28 July 44 B.C.E. (334.1 SB [Fam. 7.19.1]). Moreover,Cicero states in the introduction to Topicathat the work was com-posed on a recent sea voyage, which departed from Velia (5). Thedate of this departure can be estimated with some precision becauseCicero also wrote to Trebatius from Velia on 20 July 44 (333 SB[Fam. 7.20]). Thus, according to Cicero, Topicawas composed between20 and 28 July 44.40What is more troublesome about the Topicais the provenance ofthe work. We learn from Cicero’s introduction to Topicaand his let-ter of 28 July that the work was composed as a favor. While brows-ing in Cicero’s personal library at Tusculum, Trebatius chanced upon‘certain Topicsof Aristotle, which were explained by that man inmultiple books’ (Top. 1).41At the time Trebatius asked Cicero about38Cf. Merchant (1890): 84.39For the date of De divinatione, I generally follow the account provided by ArthurStanley Pease, ed., M. Tulli Ciceronis De divinatione, libri duo, University of Illinois Studiesin Language and Literature6 (1920): 13–15.40Doubts exist about the possibility of composition in such a brief period (seeJorma Kaimio, Cicero’s Topica: The Preface and Sources, Turun yliopiston julkaisuja.Sarja B, Humaniora, 141 [ Turku, Finland: Turun yliopisto 1976]: 12–13, and lit-erature cited). However, there is no doubt that Topicawas completed by the dateof letter to Trebatius.41Here and elsewhere, citations to the text of this work refer to Marci TulliCiceronis Topica, Biblioteca philologica 1, Georgius Di Maria, ed. (Palermo: L’epos1994). In selecting this edition, I follow Jakob Wisse, who evaluates Di Maria’s textas presently ‘the best available by far’ (Review of M.

Cicero replied that they contained amethod for inventing arguments, whereupon Trebatius pleaded withCicero in order that he might impart ‘these things’ to him (1–2).Cicero hesitated at first, proposing that Trebatius read the books orlearn the whole theory from a rhetorician, but he eventually grantedTrebatius’ request by composing his book entitled Topica(Top. 4–5,334.1 SB [Fam. 7.19.1]). Within the circumstances of its composi-tion, however, the contents of this book pose a problem: WhileTrebatius’ request was evidently prompted by the Topicaof Aristotle,Cicero’s Topicahas almost nothing in common with that work.Considerable ingenuity has been applied to this problem over theyears. Some scholars have argued that despite theoretical disparities,Cicero nonetheless based his Topicaon books known as Aristotle’sTopica; in fact, we find positions that Cicero misremebered the stan-dard Topica of Aristotle,42that Cicero used other books entitled Topicaby Aristotle,43that Cicero used Aristotle’s Rhetoricunderstanding thatit contained a Topica,44and that Cicero followed a work spuriouslyattributed to Aristotle and entitled Topica.45Others have either arguedor assumed that disparities between Cicero’s Topicaand Aristotle’sTopicaare inconsequential; among these we find views that Ciceronowhere says he is explicating the Topicaof Aristotle46and thatCicero’s direct source is Aristotle (in the Rhetoric),47Antiochus,48Philo,4942Bornecque (1924): 61–62; M.

I say this because, whatever it was that promptedTrebatius to make his request, Cicero makes clear throughout hisTopica that the work is designed to do something other than sum-marize Aristotle’s Topica.51In fact, Cicero begins his Topicawith anexplicit reminder of the terms of Trebatius’ request and the cir-cumstances of its making. Specifically, when Cicero had explainedthat Aristotle’s Topicaoffered a method of inventing arguments,Trebatius had immediately requested Cicero to impart ‘these things’to him (2). On Cicero’s interpretation, this request was about themethod of inventing arguments, not about Aristotle’s books.52For,he deliberately fulfills the request by constructing a general accountof topics for invention in argumentation. Within this construction,Aristotle is mentioned, to be sure, but only as the founder of dialec-tical investigations on invention and judgment (6–7). Once Ciceroaddresses himself to inventional topics per se, Aristotle disappears intothe background and is mentioned by the way in a single passage(35). Ultimately, at the conclusion of Topica, Cicero returns to Trebatius’request and characterizes the manner in which it has been fulfilled.Cicero says that, lest he omit anything pertaining to invention ofarguments, he has included even more in the work than Trebatiushad requested (100). Given that Trebatius, at least, would have rec-ognized any dissimulation in Cicero’s depiction of his request andwhether it was fulfilled, I think we must take Cicero at his word:Topicaresponded to a request that Cicero generally explain topicalinvention of arguments.Now, some commentators have resisted the foregoing conclusionbased on a clause in Cicero’s dedicatory letter to Trebatius regard-ing Topica. Specifically, in the third sentence, Cicero writes, instituiTopica Aristotelea conscribere(334.1 SB [Fam. 7.19.1]). This clause hasbeen interpreted as demonstrating that Cicero’s Topicasummarizeda work known as Aristotle’s Topica. However, I do not believe the50Caspar Hammer, Commentatio de Ciceronis topicis, Annalem Gymnasii LandaviniLibellum (Landavi: Formis E. Kaussleri 1879): 27.51The question has been raised whether Cicero’s library actually held a copy ofAristotle’s Topica; see, e.g., Barnes (1997): 55–57; Wisse (1989): 136–137. However,the resolution of this question—one way or the other—does not affect my inter-pretation of Cicero’s intentions in composing his own Topica.52Cf. Grube (1965): 173, n. 2; Stump (1978): 22.468 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 468"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"linguistic evidence supports such a conclusion. My main reason forthis view is that conscriberewithout the preposition denever meansanything like ‘summarize’ or ‘explicate,’ and within the context ofthe clause at stake, it can only mean ‘write’ or ‘compose.’53Thus,the correct interpretation of the clause must be ‘I began to writemy Aristotelian Topica’ or, as has recently been suggested, ‘I beganto write a Topicain the manner of Aristotle.’54Such an interpreta-tion, I would suggest, hardly supports—much less necessitates—theconclusion that a work known as Aristotle’s Topicawas the sourceof Cicero’s work of the same name.Of course, if we must look outside Aristotle’s Topicafor the inspi-ration of Cicero’s work, we are faced with the problem of identify-ing its alternative source or sources. Because my argument regardingthe provenance of Topicais dependent upon an analysis of its con-tents, I would like to postpone my treatment of this problem untilI have outlined the nature of the work. Besides, a look at the doc-trines in Topicaand Cicero’s reflections upon them will allow me toaddress my central concern in the present discussion, namely, theargument that Cicero constructed Topicaas an illustration of philo-sophical rhetoric.Topicamay be divided into seven segments: prologue (1–5), theo-retical introduction (6–7), preliminary discussion of topics (8–24),advanced discussion of topics (25–78), topics and the question (79–96),topics and the parts of a speech (97–99), and conclusion (100).55Aswe have seen, the prologue is addressed to Trebatius and explainswhat motivated Cicero to write Topica(1–4) as well as when andhow he completed the work (5).The theoretical introduction positions the work in the philosoph-ical tradition of logical inquiry. Cicero subsumes his subject underthe ‘theory of discussion’ and divides it into two parts, invention andjudgment. Aristotle, he says, founded both parts of the theory. TheStoics, he adds, pursued judgment ‘diligently;’ however inventionthey ‘left completely untouched’ (6). Cicero says that he will pursueinvention and promises a future investigation of judgment, shouldthe leisure for such study be permitted to him (7).53See OLD, s.v. conscribo.No extant manuscript of this letter contains dein theclause at stake here (Shackleton Bailey, ed., Epistulae ad familiares, 2: 186).54I refer to Fuhrmann (2000): 11, n. 16: ‘De woorden Topica Aristotelea in debegeleidende brief aan Trebatius betekenen “een topiek op de manier van Aristoteles.”’55Cf.

Definitions concern ‘topic’ as the ‘place of an argument’and ‘argument’ as the ‘reasoning which persuades about a thing thatis uncertain.’ The distinction divides topics into those which areinherent in the subject discussed and those which are external tothat subject (8). Cicero observes that internal topics are those whichprovide arguments from the whole subject (= definition, 8, 9), fromits parts (= enumeration 8, 10), from its signifier (= etymology, 8,10), and from things connected to the subject (8, 11), including lin-guistic connection, genus, species, similarity, difference, contrary,adjuncts, antecedents, consequents, contradictions, cause, effect, andcomparison with greater, equal, and lesser things (11–23). In the caseof each inherent topic, Cicero provides an example of legal argu-ment drawn from the topic, usually with no further explication.External topics are described as depending upon authority and gen-erating arguments apart from the expertise of art (what the Greekscall êtexnoi). To explain extrinsic arguments Cicero proposes a sin-gle legal example—the stipulation of a definition taken from a knownlegal authority (24).Having concluded his preliminary discussion, Cicero notes that hehas set out the topics for the invention of every argument. And hesuggests that even this preliminary discussion would be sufficient tomeet Trebatius’ request (25). Nevertheless, he resolves to offer a moreadvanced discussion. His stated justification is that each of the top-ics has its own members or elements (26). In actuality, however, thediscussion subdivides only about half of the topics using analyticalcategories. Among inherent topics, definitions (26–28), enumerations(33–34), similarities (41–45), contraries (47–49), adjuncts (50–52), con-tradictions (55–57), causes (58–64), and comparisons (68–70) aredeveloped with additional analytical details. External topics receivecloser attention. Cicero says that they depend upon testimony andadds that testimony is convincing when it is based on authority.Authority is then divided into sorts related to virtue and to circum-stances. Authority derived from circumstances relates to talent, wealth,age, luck, art, experience, physical or mental necessity, and fortu-itous events (73–75). Authority drawn from virtue is natural in thecase of gods and manifest through divine utterances (e.g., oracles)and divine works (e.g., the heavenly order; 76–77). Authority drawnfrom virtue is earned in the case of humans and becomes apparentfrom skill, study, learning, and probity (76, 78).470 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 470"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Apart from his stated justification, however, Cicero’s reasons foroffering a second, more advanced treatment of inventional topics arenot difficult to discover. Although he dedicates and adapts his Topicato Trebatius, a jurist, Cicero apparently wishes to expand applica-tion of the topics discussed beyond legal argument, and the advanceddiscussion is a means of achieving this end. For, within the advanceddiscussion of inherent topics, Cicero is able to observe that similar-ity, contradiction, and cause are more relevant to orators and philoso-phers than to jurists (41, 56, 65). Likewise, he can extend the treatmentof adjuncts in a way that is useful to orators alone (51). Particularlyin this last connection, Cicero’s motivation is made explicit. To excusehis turn away from legal argument in extending the treatment ofadjuncts, Cicero presumes upon Trebatius’ indulgence (51): ‘Never-theless you will permit that no topic be omitted by me from thetext-book I have begun, lest, if you believe that nothing should bewritten unless it pertains to you, you appear to esteem yourself toomuch.’ The upshot is that Cicero intends for his advanced discus-sion of inherent topics to display their utility for the orator. Muchthe same may be said about the advanced discussion of external top-ics. Here Cicero must excuse the entirety of his extension, becauseexternal topics have no place in legal argument; accordingly, he bidsTrebatius to be patient once more (72):...let us say a few words concerning these <external topics>, althoughthey pertain to your arguments in no respect at all; but just the samelet us complete the whole matter, since we have begun. For you arenot he whom nothing delights unless it is civil law, and seeing thatthese things are written to you so as to ensure that they are also goingto come into the hands of others, pains are taken so that we can trans-mit as much as possible to those who delight in proper studies.Within this comment, the ‘others’ whom Cicero has in mind mustcertainly include orators, because his explanations and examples ofexternal topics frequently mention judicial circumstances (73, 75, 76).Thus, the advanced discussion of external topics is clearly designedto make such topics accessible to practitioners of oratory.Cicero embarks upon his discussion of topics and the questionwithout much explanation. He observes that every discussion involvesat least one of the topics he has explained and notes that some top-ics are better suited to some questions than others. This leads imme-diately to an exposition of the types of question. And here we getthe distinction between unlimited and limited questions as well as a    471MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 471"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"stipulation that every unlimited question is a part of a limited ques-tion (79–80). Unlimited questions, he says, are of two sorts (81). Onesort, theoretical questions, concerns reality, definition, and quality,and these are pursued respectively using methods of conjecture,definition, and distinction of right and wrong. Conjecture examinesexistence or truth, origin, cause, and possible modifications of a thing(82). Definition addresses the concept of a thing, its peculiar prop-erty, analysis, enumeration of parts, and characterizing description(83). Distinction of right and wrong pertains to simple and com-parative inquiries. Simple inquiries are about choice and avoidance,justice and injustice, and honor and baseness. Comparative inquiriesconcern identity and difference as well as superiority and inferiorityof values (84–85). The other sort of unlimited question, practicalquestions, pertains to duty and arousing, calming, or removing emo-tions (86).With reference to this scheme, Cicero addresses which topics aresuitable to which questions, but he discusses only theoretical ques-tions, organizing his comments in relation to their methods. Conjecture,he says, is most assisted by topics of cause, effect, and adjuncts (87).Definition is best helped by definition, similarity, difference, antecedents,consequents, contradictions, cause, and effect (87–88). As regards dis-tinction of right and wrong, Cicero suggests that the topic of com-parison is useful for comparative inquiries (89). However, in regardto simple inquiries, he proposes the use of topics apart from theinherent and external topics he has already discussed. Choice andavoidance, he says, may be pursued using advantages and detrimentsof mind, body, or external things. Honor and baseness may be pur-sued with recourse to goods and evils of mind (89). Finally, justiceand injustice are subject to treatment using topics of equity, partic-ularly those related to natural law (rights to property and revenge)and institutional law (laws, agreements, and customs; 90).As for limited questions, Cicero divides them into judicial, delib-erative, and laudatory types. Regarding these types, he offers twomethods for identifying appropriate topics. In the first method, theend of each type is used to indicate which topics are suitable. Thusbecause the end of the judicial type is justice, it is handled by thetopics of equity. For the deliberative type, the end is advantage, soit is treated using advantages and detriments of mind, body, andexternal things. The laudatory type takes honor as its end, thereforeit can be treated using goods and evils of mind (91). In the second472 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 472"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"method, the issues of dispute associated with each type are appliedto recognize which topics are fitting. Here Cicero insists that judi-cial, deliberative, and laudatory questions are all subject to inquiryusing the same three sources of dispute that applied to theoreticalunlimited questions, namely, reality, definition, and quality (92–94).Cicero closes the treatment of limited questions by referring to sourcesof dispute arising from written documents. He observes that all writ-ten documents—including laws, will, and contracts—are subject todispute because of ambiguity, discrepancy between what is writtenand what intended, and conflicting documents (95–96).Just before concluding the Topica, Cicero provides a brief segmenton topics and the parts of a rhetorical speech. However, his approachis not to set down which topics are appropriate for which speechparts; rather, he specifies what objectives topical selections should bedesigned to achieve. So, for introductions, topics should make theaudience benevolent, docile, and attentive. Topics for narrationsshould be chosen to make this speech part plain, brief, clear, cred-ible, respectable, and dignified (97). The proof aims at persuasion,so all the topics pertinent to persuasion are relevant (98). In the per-oration, topics for amplification are useful, because amplificationheightens and calms emotions of the audience (98–99).Finally, as indicated above, Cicero closes Topicawith a very shortconclusion that addresses the nature of his fulfillment of the entreatythat precipitated its composition. Specifically, he returns to the termsof Trebatius’ request, that Cicero impart the means of inventingarguments, and states very clearly that he has provided more thanwas requested. To amplify his claim of fulfillment, Cicero likens asale of property to the social and literary transaction that has occurredbetween Trebatius and himself: ‘Thus to that which we were obligedto give to you in full possession, so to speak, we wished to be addedcertain ornaments that were not owed.’ (100).Consistent with the preceding, it is now possible to address bothof the matters previously reserved for this place, namely, the sourceor sources of Topicaand Cicero’s theoretical intentions for the work.Let me discuss the matter of provenance first.56The reader will havenoticed that several major elements of Topicaare similar to corre-sponding elements in Partitiones oratoriae. First, we find in both works56The approach I take here is comparable to that of Riposati (1961): 254–61.    473MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 473"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"a topical account of argumentative invention that divides topics intoinherent and external categories (Top. 8, Part. 5). Moreover, withinthese categories the lists of topics are nearly identical. Under therubric of inherent topics the two works share thirteen of sixteen top-ics in each list, including definition, enumeration, genus, species, sim-ilarity, difference, contrary, adjuncts, antecedents, contradictions,cause, effect, and comparison with greater, equal, and lesser things(Top. 8–11, Part. 7).57As regards external topics both works con-ceptualize external arguments as testimony, recognize utterances ofgods and humans as instances of testimony, contemplate human utter-ances that are voluntary and involuntary, and posit authority as acrucial factor in the credibility of human utterance (Top. 73–78, Part.6). Second, we find in the two works an account of unlimited mat-ters subdivided into theoretical and practical categories (Top. 81, Part.62). Moreover, both accounts posit three sorts of issues associatedwith the theoretical category, namely, questions of reality, definition,and quality (Top. 82–85, Part. 62), and both represent the practicalcategory as involving two issues, specifically, duty and arousing andcalming emotion (Top. 86, Part. 67). Third, we find in the two worksaccounts of limited matters which divide such matters into three gen-era, judicial, deliberative, and laudatory (Top. 91, Part. 10, 70) andwhich characterize the issues at stake in all three genera as ques-tions of reality, definition, and quality (Top. 93–94, Part. 33). Fourth,the two works conceive speeches as a four-part structure and describethe functions of parts in similar fashion. Both works characterize theintroduction as making the audience friendly, receptive, and atten-tive (Top. 97, Part. 28), and while Partitiones oratoriaedescribes narra-tions as achieving clarity (including brevity), credibility, and charm(31–32), Topicadescribes narrations as aiming to be plain, brief, clear,credible, restrained, and dignified (97). Both works characterize the57I am identifying the following inherent topic pairs from Top. 8–11 and Part.7 respectively: ex toto—definitio = definitio; ex partibus—enumeratio partium = distributiones;ex genere = genera partium; ex forma = generum partes; ex similitudine = similia; ex differentia= dissimilia; ex contrario = contrario; ex adiunctis = ea quae sunt quasi coniuncta; ex anteceden-tibus = praecurrentia; ex repugnantibus = ea quae sunt quasi pugnantia, ex causis = causae; exeffectis = effecta; ex comparatione maiorum aut parium aut minorum = rerum contentiones, quidmaius, quid par, quid minus sit. The two works differ concerning inherent topics onlyinsofar as Topicaincludes etymology (ex nota—notatio; 8, 10), linguistic connection(coniugata;11), and consequents (ex consequentibus; 11), where Partitiones oratoriaeincludesconsistency (consentanea;7), discrepancy (dissentanea; 7), and elementary stages (pri-mordia rerum; 7).474 . MAY_f16_444-480 7/11/02 8:57 PM Page 474"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"proof as persuading (Top. 98, Part. 33), and both represent the con-clusion as achieving multiple goals, especially arousing or calmingemotion through amplification (Top. 98, Part. 52). Now, a few ofthese similarities might be expected in any pair of rhetorical worksfrom the late Hellenistic period; but to my mind, the number andcomprehensive nature of the similarities between Topica and Partitionesoratoriaestrongly commends the view that both works have a com-mon intellectual origin. Accordingly, because we know that Partitionesoratoriaewas derived from the Academy, at least as Cicero under-stood that school, I think it is almost inescapable that Topicahadthe same provenance.Of course, I am not the first to associate Topicawith the Academy.But inasmuch as Cicero’s conception of Academic philosophy wasvery complex, including directly and indirectly, early Academic doc-trine, early Peripatetic doctrine, doctrines from the New Academy,and doctrines from the regenerate Old Academy,58I think it isextremely perilous to go farther and identify a single source for theTopicain its entirety. In my view, associations of Topicawith Philo,Antiochus, and early peripatetic philosophers may all have someclaim to legitimacy;59but precisely for this reason, we should resistthe temptation to link the work to such individuals—except in itsparts.60Let me now turn to the final issue concerning Topica, Cicero’s the-oretical intention for the work. As we have already seen, what moti-vated the composition (or at least completion) of Topicawas a friendlyrequest by Trebatius that Cicero explain a method for topical inven-tion of arguments. Cicero complied with the terms of this requestby summarizing part of a philosophical theory of discussion, pre-sumably an Academic account of invention by means of topics. Asan adaptation to Trebatius, a jurist, Cicero constructed this sum-mary using legal examples (6–24). However, Cicero did more than58On the complexity of Cicero’s conception of the Academic School, see abovenote 21.59Regarding sources for Topicain the early Peripatos, see, e.g., Pamela M.

KennedyEven when Cicero’s writings and political role have been studiedonly by the few—a situation found again today in the waning of theRenaissance—his name has often been widely recognized as that ofa great orator. The noun Cicero, -onis, was defined in Lewis andShort’s New Latin Dictionaryof 1879 as ‘the greatest of the Romanorators and writers,’ a lexicographer’s dictum that can be made moreacceptable by introduction of the word ‘prose’ before ‘writers.’ Cicerooccupies a unique role in history. He is the only Roman writer men-tioned by Greek critics;1medieval manuscripts of his works out-number those of any other classical Latin writer; incunabula editionsof his works number over three hundred, about twice those of Virgil;his orations have been school texts continually for two thousandyears; and though statistics are lacking, it is likely that citations ofCicero have outnumbered those from any other Roman source, atleast until the nineteenth century.Cicero has perhaps also been the most controversial of majorRoman writers. Some of this controversy originated with his politi-cal enemies; it was probably encouraged by Tiro’s publication ofCicero’s sometimes-too-candid letters,2and was perpetuated in thehistorical writings of Asinius Pollio, Cassius Dio, and others.

Zielinski was pro-fessor of Latin at the University of St Petersburg in Russia and is known also foran important study of Ciceronian prose rhythm.5Originally published by Cambridge University Press, 1903–1908; reprinted NewYork: Hafner Publishing Co. 1964.6Originally published in 1923; the commonly available 1963 edition (New York:482 . of character, Cicero’s historical role, especially at the time of theCatilinarian conspiracy and in the final confrontation with MarkAntony, has generally been admired. He found influential defendersin high places at an early time. The emperor Augustus, who hadhad a hand in Cicero’s proscription, later described him as ‘a learnedman and lover of his country’ (Plutarch, Cicero49.3), a pronounce-ment consistent with Augustan propaganda of ‘the restoration of therepublic’; and the emperor Claudius wrote a defense of Cicero inresponse to a work by Asinius Gallus in which the orator had beenunfavorably compared to Gallus’ father, Pollio (Suetonius, Claudius41). In modern times, the effort of the great German historian,Theodor Mommsen, to discredit and dishonor Cicero in his RömischeGeschichteof 1856, while exalting Julius Caesar to heroic status, hasnot, in the long run, succeeded.3Over the course of the centuries,however, the controversy more frequently concerned ‘Ciceronianism,’a matter of rhetorical, stylistic, and linguistic imitation rather thanideology and politics.The first modern account of Cicero’s legacy was Rafael Sabbadini’sLa Storia del Ciceronianismoof 1885; better known has been TadeuszZielinski’s Cicero im Wandel der Jahrhunderte(1897; 1908).4 About thesame time J.

L. Clarke inCicero, ed. by T. A. Dorey.8Although the main outlines of the recep-tion of Cicero throughout the ages have changed little in the lastcentury, much research has been published in recent decades thatcasts new light on the subject. In what follows I shall sketch the his-tory of Ciceronianism as generally understood, adding references toimportant recent scholarship that sometimes modifies the detailedpicture. Consistent with the objective of this book, this account ofCicero’s legacy will focus on his rhetoric and oratory. A reasonableargument could be made, however, that Cicero’s greatest legacy towestern civilization was for long from his philosophical works, whichare a major source for knowledge of Hellenstic philosophy and inwhich he created a Latin philosophical vocabulary that continued inuse as long as philosophy was written in Latin. Among the philo-sophical works, De Amicitia, Disputationes Tusculanae, and De Officiiswereprobably the most studied. De Officiis, known in Britain and Americaas ‘Tully’s Offices,’ was easily adapted to Christianity9and becamea cornerstone of medieval, renaissance, and early modern ethicaltheory.How Cicero was remembered in the two generations after hisdeath emerges from the account of declamation in the Augustanperiod written by Seneca the Elder. Two of the seven suasoriaedescribed by Seneca develop their imaginary themes from the cir-cumstances of Cicero’s death: ‘Cicero deliberates whether to begAntony for his life’ (Suas. 6) and ‘Cicero deliberates whether to burnhis writings, Antony promising him safety if he does’ (Suas. 7). Senecasays (Suas. 6.12) that few declaimers urged Cicero to beg for his lifeand (7.10) that he knew of none who recommended burning hisCooper Square Publishers) contains no hint that it is a reprint of a book publishedforty years before and unrevised.7Gilbert Highet, The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature(New York: Oxford University Press 1949), and R.

He quotes (6.22) Livy’s balanced encomiumfrom a part of his History of Romethat is otherwise lost. It endedwith the statement, ‘To weigh his vices against his virtues, he wasa great and memorable man, and to praise him fully would requirea Cicero as encomiast.’ There is perhaps some irony in the con-cluding sententiain that what many remembered most about Cicerowas his tendency toward self-praise. Asinius Pollio had also includedan evaluation of Cicero in his history of the times; Seneca says (6.14)that Pollio ‘remained the most hostile to Cicero’s fame,’ and (6.24)that he alone described Cicero’s death with malice, ‘but neverthe-less, against his will, he offered him full testimony,’ adding later(6.25), ‘Nothing in his histories was more eloquent than this.’ Thesharpest extant attack on Cicero is found in the Invectiva in M. TulliumCiceronem, which pretends to be the work of the historian Sallust andforms a counterpart to an invective against Sallust attributed toCicero. These two short speeches are rhetorical exercises, probablyby the same author and written in the Augustan period. That againstCicero utilizes some of the things, both true and false, that had beensaid by his enemies during his lifetime.11Already toward the end of his life, as seen in Brutus (e.g., 283–91)and Orator(28–32; 75–90), Cicero felt it necessary to defend his ora-torical style against the criticisms of Calvus, Brutus, and others whopreferred a plainer style and called themselves ‘Atticists’ in contrastto the ‘Asianism’ they attributed to him.12Controversies over Ciceronianprose were to become the most characteristic feature of Cicero’slegacy in the Renaissance. Largely under the influence of declama-tion as practiced in the schools of rhetoric and described by Senecathe Elder, fashions in prose style changed significantly in the century10The Philippics, in which Cicero had attacked Antony, were understood to bethe primary cause of his anger. In addition to the two suasoriaethere is a controver-sia(7.2) on the indictment of Cicero’s assassin, whom he is said to have defendedearlier (cf. Seneca’s comment in 7.2.8).11Zielinski (1908): 347–57, provides an extended analysis of the charges.12Cf. also Tacitus, Dialogus de Oratoribus18. On Roman Atticism see A.

His works were studied for their philosophical,historical, and legal contents—witness the learned commentaries onsome of his orations by Q. Asconius Pedianus dating from the mid-dle of the first century after Christ—but to many his prose had cometo seem verbose, pompous, and outdated. What teachers and stu-dents preferred was the abrupt, pregnant, epigrammatic style, asso-ciated especially with Seneca the Younger. Aulus Gellius (12.2.3–9)quotes part of a lost epistle in which Seneca disparaged the writingsnot only of Cicero, but of the venerable Ennius and the saintedVirgil,13and Seneca’s references to Cicero in his extant works areconsistent with this; in Epistles40.1, for example, he says ‘Our Cicero,from whom Roman eloquence took its start, was a plodder (gradarius),’and in Epistles114.16, one of his major discussions of prose style,he makes the following comment: ‘What shall I say about that stylein which words are postponed and after being long expected, hardlyeven come in the last clause? What about that slowness in ending(sentences), which is characteristic of Cicero, a deflected and gentleholding back and ending, in its usual way, with the same rhythm?’The charge is that Cicero’s long periods, with the main verb oftenpostponed, tend to end again and again with the same prose rhythm,notoriously exemplified by the (admittedly Ciceronian) clausula, essevideatur.14A more sustained criticism of Ciceronian rhetoric is foundin Tacitus’ Dialogue On Orators (22–23), where it is attributed to themodernist Aper. Cicero, he says, had the same battle with his con-temporaries as the modernists are now having, for Cicero’s con-temporaries admired the ancients. He was the first to polish hisspeeches, to exercise careful word choice, and to compose artisti-cally. Toward the end of his life his style improved and he usedmore of those sententiaewhich characterize modern eloquence. ‘Hisearlier speeches do not lack the vices of antiquity: he is slow in hisintroductions, long in narrations, tiresome in digressions; he is slowlymoved, rarely excited; only a few sentences end aptly and with somebrilliance.’At the dramatic date of the dialogue, A.D. 75, Quintilian hadbegun his tenure of the chair of rhetoric in Rome funded by theemperor Vespasian. His appointment can be seen as a part of13Seneca seems here to have been primarily interested in Cicero’s use of Ennius.14Cf.

Quintilian says (10.1.126) that at thetime Seneca’s works were in the hands of almost all young men. ‘Idid not want to exclude him (from being read), but my aim was notto allow him to be preferred to better writers, whom he had neverceased to disparage.’ It was a major feature of Quintilian’s programto install Cicero and Cicero’s writings as the prime model for studyand imitation by students, an objective in which he seems to havehad some success in the next generation15and considerable influencein later centuries. Of Cicero Quintilian says (10.1.112),Not unjustly it was said by men of his own age that he reigned inthe lawcourts, and for posterity the name of Cicero has come to beregarded not as the name of a man but of eloquence. Let us, there-fore, look to him, take him as our model, and let a student know thathe has made progress when he becomes an admirer of Cicero.These passages occur in Quintilian’s survey of Greek and Latin lit-erature as a source of copia, or abundance of subjects and words,the subject of the long first chapter of Book Ten of his Education ofthe Orator, published in A.D. 95. Slightly earlier in the chapter heprovides a comparison of the rhetorical style of Demosthenes andCicero, where he says that Demosthenes’ style is denser, Cicero’smore copious; Demosthenes fights with a rapier, Cicero with thatand the bludgeon as well, ‘nothing can be taken from the former,nothing added to the latter’ (10.1.106). Throughout the work it isclear that Cicero is to Quintilian the closest to the perfect oratorthat can be found, though not perhaps the greatest that may yetcome (cf. 12.11.25–30). One of the few concessions Quintilian is will-ing to make to the corrupted taste of his time is the use of moresententiaethan employed by Cicero. Quintilian’s concept of the idealorator is derived directly from Cicero (cf., e.g., 12.pr.4) and he quotesextensively from Cicero’s De Oratoreand Orator, as well as from Brutusand other parts of Cicero’s Rhetorica. He constantly illustrates rhetor-ical teaching from Cicero’s speeches; Pro Cluentio, Pro Ligario, ProMilone, and the speeches against Verres are those most frequentlycited. He expected his students to have read and to continue to read15As seen especially in the style of Pliny the Younger, who had studied withQuintilian.486 . MAY_f17_481-501 7/11/02 8:58 PM Page 486"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Cicero’s works, and it can be assumed that many other teachers ofrhetoric did so as well.Early Christian writers show an ambivalent attitude toward secu-lar learning. The most famous anecdote relating to this is told bySaint Jerome (Epistles 22.29–30), writing in the late fourth century.He says he tried to cut himself offfrom pagan learning but couldnot forego his library. He fasted and tried to read the Old Testamentbut became disgusted with the style and then would read Cicero.He became ill and preparations were made for his funeral. Suddenlyhe had a vision in which he was brought before the judgment seat.He threw himself on the ground and averted his eyes from the heav-enly judge, who asked him to state his ‘condition.’ Jerome repliedthat he was a Christian. ‘You lie,’ came the answer. ‘You are aCiceronian, not a Christian’; ‘For where your treasure is, there willyour heart be also’ [Matthew 6:21]. The bystanders prayed for hisforgiveness and Jerome promised to mend his ways.Several of the Latin fathers had been teachers of rhetoric beforetheir conversion and they often wrote better Latin than did secularwriters. Tertullian (ca.A.D. 160–225), the most important of the ear-lier Latin Fathers, wrote a vigorous, highly rhetorical but very non-Ciceronian prose and often seems scornful of pagan learning, buthe expresses respect for Demosthenes and Cicero (Apologeticus11 and15–16), and a more Ciceronian prose style is characteristic of otherFathers. Octavius, for example, by Minucius Felix, is an elegant philo-sophical dialogue in Ciceronian style written early in the third cen-tury, defending Christianity against pagan criticisms. It is not onlyCiceronian in genre and prose style but draws on the content ofCicero’s philosophical works. Lactantius (ca.250–320) taught rhetoricin North Africa and at the court of Diocletian in Asia Minor andwas later the tutor of Crispus, the son of Constantine. He was mas-ter of a beautiful Ciceronian prose style, and his Divine Institutesaimedto win respect for Christianity from discriminating readers with argu-ments based on evidence from secular writers, including Cicero. Inthe Renaissance he came to be known as ‘the Christian Cicero.’ Themost important Christian writer who was indebted to Cicero wascertainly Augustine (A.D. 354–430). The subject is too complex todescribe here in any depth.16Augustine claims that the first stage in16Among many discussions, see Henri-Irenée Marrou, Saint Augustin et la fin de la’    487MAY_f17_481-501 7/11/02 8:58 PM Page 487"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"what was his eventual conversion to Christianity originated with read-ing Cicero:In the usual order of study I came to a book of a certain Cicero,whose tongue almost all admire, but not his heart to the same extent.But there is a book of his containing an exhortation to philosophy andcalled Hortensius. That book changed my perception and changed myprayers, O Lord, to you. (Confessions3.4.7)In the period immediately following his conversion in 386 he wrotea series of Christianizing philosophical dialogues in Ciceronian style.17His great work De Doctrina Christiana was begun in 397, not longafter he became bishop of Hippo in North Africa, but not com-pleted until about 426.18It is a Christian hermeneutics and rhetoric,intended to help teachers and preachers to understand and expoundthe Bible. In Book 4, sections 27–58, Augustine explicitly draws onCicero’s discussion of the duties of the orator—to teach, to delight,and to move—and their relation to the three kinds of style, plain,middle, and grand as described in Cicero’s Orator. Through Augustine’smediation, Cicero made a contribution to preaching, especially inthe Carolingian Age and again in the seventeenth century.Rhetores Latini Minores is the name given to a collection of treatiseson rhetoric, primarily dating from later antiquity and the early MiddleAges.19Included are works on figures of speech, general rhetoricalhandbooks, sections on rhetoric from encyclopedias of the liberalarts, commentaries, and other material. The dominant influence isthat of Cicero, whose rhetorical writings provided much of the the-ory and whose orations are the source of most of the examples usedin the comprehensive rhetorical handbooks of Fortunatianus, SulpitiusVictor, Julius Severianus, and Julius Victor. These works, dating fromthe fourth and fifth centuries, found some limited use in the MiddleAges, but the encyclopedias were to be found in most medievallibraries and it was through them that students could acquire someelementary understanding of the system of Ciceronian rhetoric.

When still ateenager Cicero began an ambitious treatise on rhetoric but he onlycompleted the first two books, which deal with rhetorical invention.It is this work, together with a handbook from about the same timeby an unknown writer covering all five parts of rhetoric known asRhetorica ad Herennium, that came to dominate the western rhetoricaltradition well into the Renaissance. Rhetorica ad Herenniumwas com-monly referred to as Cicero’s Rhetorica Secunda. Apparently these workswere preferred by teachers or students for their systematic, evenpedantic account of rhetoric in a way that could be memorized, fortheir relative brevity compared to De Oratoreor Quintilian’s treatise,both of which began to be neglected, and of course for the authority20For a translation and discussion, see William H.

This is the passage in which young Ciceroreflects on the history of rhetoric, with the conclusion that ‘Wisdomwithout eloquence does too little to benefit states, but eloquence with-out wisdom does too much harm and is never advantageous.’A commentary on De Inventione had been written in the second orthird century after Christ by a rhetorician named Marcomannus;this does not survive and is known from references in Victorinus’commentary, written in the fourth century. Another commentary wascomposed by Grillius in the sixth century. These, together with thesections on rhetoric in the encyclopedias, were the major source ofknowledge of classical rhetorical theory in the early western MiddleAges. Surprisingly little was done to adapt the theory to medievalconditions until the eleventh century, when handbooks of letter-writing, called ars dictaminis, begin to appear.23These draw heavilyon De Inventioneand Rhetorica ad Herennium.24To judge by the num-ber of manuscripts, until the middle of the twelfth century De Inventionewas the acknowledged authority; but thereafter commentaries onRhetorica ad Herennium, with its account of arrangement, style, memory,and delivery as well as invention, indicate preference for this fullerwork. A large number of commentaries on both works were com-posed from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries, originating in thelectures of teachers in Italy, France, and elsewhere, and translationswere made of De Inventione into the vernacular languages, for exam-ple into Italian and French by Brunetto Latini (1220–94), the teacherof Dante.25He also made Italian translations of Cicero’s speechesfor Marcellus, Ligarius, and King Deiotarus, the first translations ofCiceronian oratory into any language.The development of civic communes in Italy in the thirteenth cen-tury created opportunities for public address that had hardly existed23Writings of Alcuin and Hrabanus Maurus in the Carolingian period showawareness of contemporary conditions; Notker of St Gall reorganized classical rhetor-ical theory in a form useful to German monks around A.D. 1000; cf.

Petrarch was already a greatadmirer of Cicero, and he announced his exciting discovery in theform of a letter addressed to Cicero himself.28In Cicero’s lettersPetrarch and others rediscovered what was to be a major feature ofrenaissance thought, the existence and possibilities of personality andindividuality. Thus began the series of discoveries which, togetherwith the recovery of a knowledge of Greek and Greek literature, wasthe foundation of humanistic learning. Although De InventioneandTopica were well known throughout the Middle Ages, Cicero’s majorrhetorical writings had not been easily available.29De OratoreandOrator were known in a mutilated form and Brutus was quite unknownfrom late antiquity until 1422, when Gerardo Landriani discovereda manuscript at Lodi containing the complete text of all three works.That manuscript has been lost and its texts are known today fromcopies made in the fifteenth century. The minor rhetorical works,Partitiones Oratoriae andDe Optimo Genere Oratorum, could be found ina few medieval libraries. Some of Cicero’s orations, including theVerrines, Pro Archia, and the Catilinarians, were to be found in somemedieval libraries; some others, including Pro Sextio Roscioand ProMurena, were virtually unknown until Poggio Bracciolini acquired the26See Virginia Cox, “Ciceronian Rhetoric in Italy, 1260–1350,” Rhetorica 17(1999): 239–88.27See Boethius’s In Ciceronis Topica, translated with Notes and Introduction byEleonore Stump (Ithaca: Cornell University Press 1988).28Petrarch, Epistulae ad Familiares 24.3; cf.

In 1415, at Saint Gall, Poggio also discovered a com-plete manuscript of Quintilian, whose treatise, like De Oratorehadbeen known largely from a mutilated text, and he made discoveriesof additional Ciceronian speeches in 1417. The dissemination of theseworks among the humanists sparked a renaissance of Ciceronian andrhetorical studies, first in Italy and then through western Europegenerally. In 1465, De Oratorewas the first book to be printed inItaly on the introduction there of the new technology, and the otherrhetorical works and speeches followed soon thereafter. R. R. Bolgar’swords about the wider impact of Cicero in early renaissance Italyare probably only slightly exaggerated:The writings of Cicero with their idealisation of the Roman Republicbegan to exercise an influence which would have occasioned theirauthor the keenest pleasure. The public spirit, the profound good sense,the urbanity, which Cicero attributed to those he chooses to praise,but above all the picture he paints by almost imperceptible touches—that famous Roman picture—of a life dignified by practical activityand rendered delightful by beauty and learning, opened men’s eyes tothe possibilities of a culture based on the city-state. Very gradually andhesitantly—for after all Rome had been pagan—there developed firstin Italy and then elsewhere a cult of the past radically different fromany that had gone before. With immense reservations, and withoutdaring as yet to confess the fact, men were coming to admire antiq-uity for its own sake.30In Italy, republicanism was doomed to disappointment by the returnof autocratic government in the sixteenth century, but this enthusi-asm was to be reawakened in America and France in the eighteenthcentury.Latin was the universal language of scholarship and education inEurope throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The Latin incommon use in the Middle Ages, however, had departed significantlyfrom classical Latin standards. Italian humanists of the fourteenthand fifteenth centuries, with their increasing familiarity with andenthusiasm for the writings of Cicero, Quintilian, and other classi-cal authors, reacted strongly against what they regarded as the bar-barism of medieval Latin. As in Roman times, so in the Renaissanceimitation of classic models was a basic tool in teaching written andoral composition.

The latefifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, however, became the time ofdoctrinaire Ciceronians, of whom Pietro Bembo, Christopher Langolius,and Paolo Cortesi are the best examples. They insisted on using noLatin word, or sentence construction, that could not be found inCicero’s writings. Cardinal Bembo used his influential position inRome to make Ciceronian Latin the standard for the administrationof the Catholic Church: dates were given by Kalends, Nones, andIdes, nuns were called virgines vestales, the saints were divi, and car-dinals became senatores.Mario Nizzoli published a Lexicon Ciceronianumin 1535, providing a reference work, in which, though it was some-what incomplete, pure Ciceronian diction could be checked.Right from the start, however, this doctrine was controversial.Among other things, it led to strange adaptations of Latin words tocontemporary meanings and to cumbersome circumlocutions. Pro-minent opponents in Italy included Politian and Lorenzo Valla, whopreferred Quintilian as a model of style. The most celebrated oppo-nent, however, proved to be Erasmus. His Ciceronianus of 1528 is awitty dialogue in which characters named Bulephorus and Hypo-logus are out walking and encounter their acquaintance, Neoponus,who is suffering from a new disease they call ‘Ciceronianism.’31Forseven years he has read no author except Cicero; a true Ciceronian,he feels, cannot be troubled with wife or children; he reads andwrites in a special, sound-proofed room in his house; a six-line let-ter takes him six nights to write and ten days to revise, to be surethat it is purely Ciceronian. Bulephorus has little difficulty ridicul-ing extreme Ciceronianism, and proceeds to a discussion of the his-tory of Latin prose down to contemporary times and the practicalproblems of exclusive Ciceronianism in discussing subjects not foundin Cicero’s writings: Christian doctrine, modern history, scientific dis-coveries, contemporary legal institutions, and the like. Bulephorussums up his position thus:31Translation by Izora Scott, Ciceronianus, or A Dialogue on the Best Style of Speaking,by Desiderius Erasmus (New York: Columbia University Teachers College, 1908;reprinted AMS Press 1972; translated again, with annotations, by Betty I.

Let us imitate him as he imitated others. Ifhe settled down to the reading of one author, if he devoted himselfto the copying of one, if he cared more for words than for ideas, ifhe did not write except in bed at night, if he worried himself a wholemonth over one letter, if he thought something eloquent which wasirrelevant, let us do the same thing that we may be Ciceronians. Butif Cicero did not do these things, which we must grant, let us, afterhis example, fill our hearts with a store of general knowledge; let uscare first for thoughts, then for words; let us adapt the words to thesubjects, not subjects to words; and while speaking let us never moveour eyes from what is seemly.32Although Erasmus’ views were attacked by purists, the best teacherscame to understand Cicero’s own view, found throughout Brutus, thatstyle was and should be an individual matter, reflecting the charac-ter of the writer, the time, the circumstances, and the subject beingdiscussed.Renaissance and early modern Ciceronianism and anti-Ciceronianismis the second phase of Cicero’s heritage extensively studied by twen-tieth-century scholars. A great deal of this research, as well as a vastamount of related material, has recently been brought together bythe twenty-five contributors to a large volume entitled Histoire de larhétorique dans l’Europe moderne, 1450 –1950, published under the direc-tion of Marc Fumaroli.33A general reaction to Ciceronianism in styleappeared in the mid-sixteenth century, especially in the writings ofJustus Lipsius. He and others of the time disliked the fullness ofCicero’s prose and were attracted to the clipped epigrammatic styleof Seneca and Tacitus. Their influence extended into the baroqueprose of the vernacular languages.34An example of the reactionagainst Ciceronianism can be seen in Montaigne’s essay, ‘Of Books,’dating from the mid-sixteenth century:As for Cicero, the works of his that can best serve my purpose arethose that treat of philosophy, especially moral.

As for his eloquence, it is entirely beyond com-parison; I believe that no man will ever equal him.35About the same time Peter Ramus was initiating his educationalreforms in Paris that transferred the study of rhetorical invention,arrangement, and memory to the course in dialectic, leaving the for-mal study of rhetoric with nothing but style and delivery. Thisinvolved a direct challenge to the tradition of Ciceronian rhetoricaltheory, although Ramus admired Cicero’s speeches.36Ramism spreadto England, where it is embraced in Gabriel Harvey’s Ciceronianusof1548, was taken up vigorously by the Puritans, who introduced itinto the curriculum at Harvard College after its founding in 1636,and remained strong for about hundred and fifty years.37The seventeenth century is the beginning of the modern periodand with it the factors leading to a partial decline in Cicero’s influenceon thought and style begin to emerge. The humanists of theRenaissance had searched for knowledge in classical texts and oftenfound truth as well as eloquence in Cicero’s writings. The NewScience of the seventeenth century, in contrast, found truth primar-ily in observation of nature and of the phenomena of human life.The loci, or commonplaces, as discussed in Cicero’s Topica, wererejected as invalid sources of logical argument.

More insidious, perhaps, was the spreadof the knowledge of Greek and appreciation of Greek literature,increasingly available in the vernacular languages, as a greater achieve-ment, more worthy of imitation than Latin. In The Advancement ofLearning(1.2.9) in 1605 Francis Bacon referred to Cicero as ‘the best,or second orator,’ correcting himself at the thought of Demosthenes.The eighteenth century, however, witnessed some revival of Cicero’sheritage. His philosophical works were important sources for deistsand philosophical sceptics, including Voltaire and Hume, and theincreased role of parliamentary government in Britain increased theneed for skills in political debate. The lectures of John Ward atGresham College in London, published in 1759 under the title ASystem of Oratory, set forth Ciceronian rhetoric in a thorough way,and were used as a textbook in Britain and America. The rhetori-cal treatises and lectures of John Lawson, Joseph Priestly, GeorgeCampbell, Hugh Blair, Richard Whately, and others in eighteenthand early nineteenth-century England, Scotland, and Ireland, and inAmerica lectures by Richard Witherspoon at Princeton and JohnQuincy Adams at Harvard, fall within the Ciceronian tradition whiledrawing ideas from Plato, Aristotle, Quintilian, and the philosophyand psychology of the time.39A variety of prose and oratorical styleswas cultivated, including styles in the vernacular reminiscent of Cicero,as in the works of Edmund Burke and Edward Gibbon. Selectedorations of Cicero remained canonical texts in schools, colleges, anduniversities and naturally became models of oratory for a new gen-eration of political activists in Britain, America, and France.40Therevolutionary period in America and in France involved appeal toancient republicanism, citations of Cicero, and extensive use of Romanslogans and Roman names as pseudonyms.38See Volker Kapp, “L’Apogée de l’atticism français ou l’éloquence qui se moquede la rhétorique,” in Historie de la rhétorique moderne, ed. by Marc Fumaroli (Paris:Presses Universitaires de France 1999): 731–36.39For discussion, see Kennedy (1999): 277–88.40On Cicero’s influence in revolutionary America, see Meyer Reinhold, ClassicaAmericana: The Greek and Roman Heritage in the United States(Detroit: Wayne StateUniversity Press 1984), esp. 24–28 and 94–100.

Cicero’s ideal orator and his own orator-ical practice deeply affected the history of education, and Cicero andCiceronian republicanism have been valuable counterbalances toJulio-Claudian imperialism and autocracy as models for the modernworld. Of all the figures of the distant past Cicero is perhaps theone we can know most intimately,43resulting from the extent of hissurviving writings, including fifty-eight orations and over nine hun-dred letters, and the personality they reveal. Cicero is a wonderfullyhuman figure, who has become a companion, mentor, and friendto many readers, a distinction rivaled perhaps only by the poetHorace from among ancient Romans.

In 1880 he published a two-volume biography of Cicero,and in the Introduction he explains why:I may say with truth that my book has sprung from love of the man,and from a heartfelt admiration of his virtues and his conduct as wellas of his gifts. I must acknowledge that in discussing his character withmen of letters, as I have been prone to do, I have found none quiteto agree with me. His intellect they have admitted and his industry;but his patriotism they have doubted, his sincerity they have disputed,and his courage they have denied. It might have become me to besilenced by this verdict, but I have rather been instigated to appeal tothe public and to ask them to agree with me against my friends. It isnot, only, that Cicero has touched all matters of interest to men andhas given a new grace to all that he has touched, that as an orator,a rhetorician, an essayist, and a correspondent he was supreme, thatas a statesman he was honest, as an advocate fearless, and as a gov-ernor pure—that he was a man whose intellectual part always domi-nated that of the body, that in taste he was excellent, in thought correctand enterprising, and that in language he was perfect. All this hasbeen already said of him by other biographers. Plutarch, who is asfamiliar to us as though he had been English, and Middleton, whothoroughly loved his subject, and latterly Mr. Forsyth, who has strug-gled to be honest to him, might have sufficed as telling us so muchas that. But there was a humanity in Cicero, a something almost ofChristianity, a stepping forward out of the dead intellectualities ofRoman life into moral perceptions, into natural affections, into domes-ticity, philanthropy and conscious discharge of duty, which do not seemto have been as yet fully appreciated. To have loved his neighbor ashimself before the teaching of Christ was much for a man to achieve;and that he did this is what I claim for Cicero and hope to bringhome to the minds of those who can find time for reading yet anotheradded to the constantly increasing volumes about Roman times.44BBolgar, R.

CraigIntroductionThis is a very selective survey of recent work in two related areasof Cicero’s literary production, his speeches and his rhetorical works.It is beyond my scope, and my knowledge, to annotate in a mean-ingful way the more than twelve hundred contributions in these areaswhich have appeared over the last twenty-five years. After dutifullycataloguing texts and translations, this survey instead focuses uponworks which have defined, advanced, or exemplified principal direc-tions in the scholarship over the last quarter century, and attemptsto extrapolate promising directions for work on Ciceronian oratoryand rhetoric in the coming decade. One area specifically neglectedis that of Cicero’s Nachleben, which George Kennedy’s chapter in thisvolume covers with typical thoroughness and conciseness.As a convenient starting point, the present survey begins roughlywhere the more comprehensive selected survey of R. J. Rowland,Jr. (1978) left off, in 1975. For our period, the invaluable biblio-graphical resource is of course l’Année philologique, with the concomi-tant second edition of the Database of Classical Bibliographycoveringthe years 1974–1989. Volume 69 covering the year 1998 was themost recent available while this survey was being compiled. Otherfreestanding bibliographies on Cicero’s speeches and rhetorica in ourperiod include R. Valenti (1975) on De Oratore, S. M. Cerutti (1993)on “James May’s ‘Trials of Character’ and Current Trends in theScholarship of Ciceronian Persuasion,” and H. Pinkster (1993) onCicero’s language and style. The bibliography on the Catilinariansby Criniti (1971), which slightly pre-dates our period, was updatedwith typical thoroughness and precision by Classen (1985: 120 n. 1).Malaspina (1997) reviews work on the fragmentary speeches fromMAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 503"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"504 . 1984–1995.

De Oratore’s text has been re-examined byTh. Hastrup in a volume with M. Leisner-Jensen’s accompanyingDanish translation (1981). The fragments of Cicero’s speeches arenow more accessible than ever before thanks to J. W. Crawford’ssecond edition with commentary (1994). More generally, commen-taries have been especially valuable for textual criticism. D. H. Berry’scommentary on Pro Sulla(see below), includes the most thoroughrecension of the text of that speech yet achieved. Another com-mentary, that of Klodt on Pro Rabirio Postumo(1992), while basedupon Olechowska’s Teubner edition, offers important textcritical dis-cussion (as well as printing a facsimile of Poggio’s autograph of thespeech). Similarly, the Amsterdam commentary on De Oratore byA. D. Leeman, H. Pinkster and others (1981, 1985c, 1989, 1996),while not offering a text, offers many emendations. May and Wisse,in a valuable appendix to their new English translation of De Oratore(2001: 307–319), take into account the work of Renting (1996), andsystematically catalogue the translators’ disagreements with the Teubnertext of Kumaniecki (1969) and with Leeman and Pinkster.Among the many freestanding articles on textual matters that ourperiod has produced, perhaps the most important are ShackletonBailey’s collections of readings in the speeches in HSCP(1979, 1985).506 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 506"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"I.B.TranslationsOur period has seen various Ciceronian speeches and rhetorica trans-lated into German more than into any other language. Especiallynoteworthy in this German production is Manfred Fuhrmann’s seven-volume translation of all the speeches (1970–1982), and his repub-lication of many of these translations in smaller collections of theVerrines (1995), of political and judicial speeches (1993, 1997) andof select masterpieces (1983). The Sammlung Tusculum has alsoissued translations of several of the rhetorica, including K. Bayer’stranslations of Topica(1993) and Partitiones Oratoriae(1994), B. Kytzler’sof Orator(1975 and subsequent editions), and Nüsslein’s of the Rhetoricaad Herennium(1994). L. Huchthausen et al. (1989) have includedGerman translations of many of the speeches as well as De Oratorein their anthology. These are noted under individual works in thebibliography, as are the contributions by the various translators inthe Reclam Universal-Bibliothek. In English, Shackleton Bailey felicitouslyturned his attention from the letters to thePhilippics(1986) and thepost reditumspeeches (1991), in each case basing his translation uponhis fruitful work on the Latin text. In 1986, T. N. Mitchell trans-lated Verrines2.1 and W. K. Lacey the Second Philippicfor Aris andPhillips. MacDonald’s Loebedition of the Catilinarians, Pro Murena, ProSulla, and Pro Flacco (1977) replaced the earlier Loebvolume of Lord.Michael Grant (1975) offered a Penguin volume of ‘Murder Trials’including Pro Roscio Amerino, Pro Cluentio, Pro C. Rabirio, Pro Caelio, ProMilone, andPro Rege Deiotaro.In the Oxford World Classicsseries, D. H.Berry (2000) has published his translations ofPro Roscio Amerino, ProMurena, Pro Archia, Pro Caelio, and Pro Milone M. Siani-Davies (2001)has done a translation of Pro Rabirio Postumowith extensive intro-duction and commentary. At this writing, the new translation of DeOratoreby J. May and J.

Narducci’s newtranslation of the Brutus(1995). Other translations in the BibliotecaUniversale Rizzoliare noted in the bibliography. Spanish translationshave burgeoned over the last fifteen years. The First Verrinewas trans-lated with an extensive introduction by Salinas (1987) in the Bibliothecascriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Mexicana. The Biblioteca Clásica Gredoshas in this time frame published seven volumes of Ciceroniana,including Nuñez’ translation of De Inventione(1997), the translationsby Requejo Prieto (1990) of all seven Verrine speeches in two vol-umes, Aspa Cereza’s translations and notes on Pro Roscio Comoedo,Pro Caecina, De Lege Agraria I–III, Pro Flacco, and Pro Caelio (1991), andonPro Roscio Amerino, De Imperio Cn. Pompei, Pro Cluentio, theCatilinarians,andPro Murena(1995), and Baños Baños’ of the six post reditumspeeches and Pro Milone(1994). The same scholar has translated theCaesariansas well (1991). Other Spanish translations are of PartitionesOratoriaeby Reyes Coria (1987), Pro Caelioby Gaos Schmidt (1976),and Pro Marcelloby Caballero de del Sastre (1999).I.C.CommentariesI.C.i.The Speeches‘But what scholars now need above all are good, detailed, up-to-datecommentaries covering all the relevant fields, history, text, and syn-tax as well as rhetoric and style. There is a danger that withoutsuch commentaries to refer to, the quality of the more general inter-pretative works which are being produced may suffer.’ (D. H. Berry[1996a], p. x.)Since Cicero’s speeches invite study as persuasive exemplars, rhetor-ical and stylistic models, and primary texts for the understanding ofRoman political, social, cultural, and legal history, as well as for thestudy of Cicero the man, scholarship about the speeches serves bothas a measure and an instrument of progress in a variety of relatedfields.The presentation of the text of a Ciceronian speech with a com-mentary that concurrently informs the reader of the current state ofthe scholarship in most or all of these fields is a formidable task,508 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 508"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"and perhaps the greatest desideratum of the next decade. As D. H.Berry has pointed out in his model commentary on Pro Sulla(1996a:ix–x), there have been only four other full commentaries on indi-vidual speeches in English in this century, those of R. G. Nisbet onDe Domo Sua(1939), of R. G. M. Nisbet on In Pisonem(1961), of R. G. Austin on Pro Caelio(1960), and of T. E. Kinsey onPro Quinctio(1971). To these Berry adds three works produced in our period:the German commentaries of J. Adamietz on Pro Murena(1989), ofKlodt onPro Rabirio Postumo(1992), and the fine, unpretentious andexplicitly pedagogical commentary of H. and K. Vretska on Pro Archia(1979). This is a very sparse field indeed. A full text and commen-tary for any Ciceronian speech would be a project of enduring valuefor any scholar with the training to assay it.The commentary as a genre has become more protean in the lasttwenty-five years. Very different from Berry, and from each other,are the two stylistic commentaries of H. C. Gotoff(1979, 1993),which will be treated under ‘Style’ below. W. B. Tyrell’s legal andhistorical commentary on Pro C. Rabirio(1978) takes the speech asa primary source for the legal and historical problems of the natureof the court and the political context that gives rise to the trial. Itis then really a historical treatment of quaestiones selectaein commen-tary format.1As Professor Cape notes above (131 n. 52) Primmer’s1985 commentary on this speech, while ostensibly concerned withpersuasive strategy, instead focuses upon the historical circumstances,Cicero’s manipulation, and the subsequent revisions of the speechfor publication. Siani-Davies’ commentary on her translation of ProRabirio Postumo, with an extensive introduction, is also aimed largelyat historical questions. A commentary on a section of one speech,with German translation, is A. Bürge’s treatment of Die Juristenkomikin Ciceros Rede Pro Murena(1974). Commentaries on more elusive textsare those of Crawford on the lost and unpublished orations knownfrom testimonia (1981) and on the fragmentary speeches (2nd. ed.,1994). We may note as well an historical commentary on an his-torical commentary, the fine work of Marshall on Asconius (1985).In a broad sense, translations with commentaries might be construedto include the Budé and Gredos volumes noted under translations1On its success in this regard, see M. C. Alexander inPhoenix33 (1979): 179–180.      509MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 509"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"above. One must certainly include the Italian translation ofPro Cluentiowith commentary geared to students of Roman criminal law byGiuffrè (1993), the Marsilio ConvivioItalian translations and com-mentaries noted under translations above, and the Aris and PhillipsEnglish translations and commentaries on Verrines2.1 by Mitchell(1986) and on the second Philippicby Lacey (1986). The latter, whileostensibly keying the commentary to the translation, is also the beststylistic commentary on that speech.The pedagogical commentaries, primarily on Pro Archia, Pro Caelio,and the Verrines, are listed under the individual speeches in the bib-liography below.I.C.ii.The RhetoricaOur period has seen the beginning, and almost the completion, ofone of the great resources of modern Ciceronian scholarship, theGerman-language commentary on De Oratoreby Leeman, Pinkster,and others (1981, 1985c, 1989, 1996, all with full lit.). The 1989Amsterdam dissertation of Rabbie on De Oratore2.216–290 is largelyincluded in the third volume. The fourth volume of the ‘AmsterdamDe Oratore’ goes through De Oratore3.95, and the fifth and final vol-ume is targeted for completion in 2003. Meanwhile, the venerable1892 Wilkins commentary on De Oratorehas been reprinted by Olms(1990). The other rhetorica have received some notation in the trans-lations mentioned above, but have passed a generation or more with-out full commentaries. This is certainly a worthwhile direction forthe decade ahead.II. ISII.A.The RhetoricaTexts, translations and commentaries are noted in the appropriate sections above.While ‘rhetorica’ has proven a convenient label for Cicero’s sevenworks dealing in a conscious way with the theory and practice ofpublic speaking and with its Roman practitioners, these works varyremarkably in genre, purpose, and content. Cicero’s youthful DeInventione, like the Rhetorica ad Herennium, an anonymous work which510 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 510"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"is contemporary and more comprehensive, is a how-to manual inthe Hellenistic rhetorical tradition. The Partitiones Oratoriae, while castin the form of a dialogue between Cicero and his son, was seen,before the work of Gaines in this volume, as a more concise treat-ment in the same technical tradition. Topicafocuses more upon lociof form than of content, and so may be thought more ‘philosophi-cal.’ De Optimo Genere Oratorumand Oratorare part of a polemicaldefense of Cicero’s style, as is the very differentBrutus, which pro-vides a history of Roman oratory. De Oratore, Cicero’s rhetorical mas-terpiece, lays out in dialogue form a vision of the ideal orator thatprovides a model of effective public leadership flowing from a com-prehensive education in the liberal arts. Only in the area of source-crit-icism can a single method be applied to all of these works. Alreadyat the beginning of our period, A. E. Douglas (1973) had pointedout that, while scholars continued to search out Cicero’s Greeksources, the primacy ofQuelllensforschunghad ended, and nothing hadyet taken its place. More than twenty-five years later, that observa-tion is still valid. Even as source criticism has continued, scholarshiphas also proceeded on the rhetorica in directions suited to the gen-eral character of each of these works.De Inventionecontinues a natural field for source criticism, and espe-cially for attempts to understand the hodge-podge of Stoic andPeripatetic elements coloring the tradition on which Cicero and theauthor of the Rhetorica ad Herenniumdraw for their understandings ofargument. Thus Calboli Montefusco (1998) and Fortenbaugh (1998)on the sources of Cicero’s discussion of syllogistic reasoning. Heath(1994) makes sense of the mutations of Hermagorean stasis theory.De Inventione’sproems give a starting point for discussion of the devel-opment of Cicero’s ideas about oratory and society, so Gennaro(1989), Lévy (1995), Grilli (1997). They also provide a focus for theorator’s aesthetics, so Staffhorst (1992). The reflection of Cicero’syouthful rhetorical theory in his later practice is a special focus ofvon Albrecht (1984) and Schmitz (1995). The resemblances betweenDe Inventioneand the Rhetorica ad Herenniumin the treatment of exor-dia led Christes (1978) to posit that the anonymous author had readCicero. The Nachlebenof De Inventioneand the Rhetorica ad Herenniumhas seen a signal contribution by Ward (1995).The Rhetorica ad Herenniumis still generally held anonymous, despitea minority insistence on calling the author Cornificius (so Calboli,1969, 1993). Other nominees for authorship are Cornutus (Herrmann      511MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 511"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"[1980]) and Hirtuleius (Achard [1985]). Because it is the first extantHellenistic rhetoric preserving the treatment of all five officia oratoris,theRhetorica ad Herenniumremains a natural way station for discus-sions of the history of the theory of style, so Adamik on the peri-odic sentence (1984) and on the three kinds of style (1995), Bertreauonsimilitudo(1977), Boccotti on asyndeton and tricolon (1975),Pennacini (1974) on archaism and neologism. Studies of mnemotech-nics must also rely on the account in ad Herennium, so den Hengst(1986), Lohmann (1991). Cicero’s ‘second rhetoric’ attracts studentsof its subsequent influence, including in our period work on Fichetby Beltran (1985), and even on Bach, by Ambrose (1980). Finally,noteworthy is Sinclair (1993), who sees ad Herenniumas a manual toteach behavior acceptable to the ruling elite. A textbook of rhetoricis a natural object for such sociological readings, and we may expectto see more work in this area. De Oratore, Cicero’s rhetorical mas-terpiece, will always be the touchstone for meditations on humanitas,on the Ciceronian educational ideal and on its influence. Thus theessays of A. Michel (1977, 1982, 1986), F. Wehrli (1978), F. Quadlbauer(1984), M. von Albrecht (1991), V. Pöschl (1995). More unique toour period, the groundbreaking work by Leeman on the structureof De Oratore I(1975), the subsequent work noted above under‘Commentaries’ by A. D. Leeman, H. Pinkster, and company onthe Amsterdam commentary on De Oratore (1981, 1985c, 1989, 1996,all with full lit.), as well as the work of J. Hall (1992, 1994) andothers, and now the thorough analytical synopsis produced by Mayand Wisse in their new English translation (2001: 42–48) have ledto a better understanding of the organization, patterns of argumen-tation, and literary coherence of the work. G. Achard (1987) haseven argued for the primacy of its political intentions. Narducci(1997) has seen its educational ideal in the context of a broaderCiceronian cultural project. These more comprehensive, literaryapproaches have thoroughly dispelled the judgment of the work asotiose, ill organized, or even flawed in its choice of the dialogueform (crystallized by B. Vickers, 1988: 29–36).Work on the relationship of De Oratoreto Greek antecedents con-tinues strong, and is showcased, for example, in the contributions toa special issue of Rhetorica(6.3 [1988]) of Fantham on Theophrastanantecedents to Cicero’s discussion of the three styles, Fortenbaughon the importance of the handbook tradition to Cicero’s concept ofwinning goodwill, and of Görler and Schütrumpf on Platonic allu-512 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 512"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"sions and influence. Fortenbaugh (1989), as part of his work onTheophrastus and the peripatetic tradition, systematically dismissesthe evidence of De Oratorethat Cicero had studied Aristotle’s Rhetoricor the Synagoge Technonwith any care.The use of De Oratorefor the understanding of the originality ofCicero’s thought and arguments has progressed, not only in thestrictly rhetorical arena, e.g. diLorenzo (1978) on ornatusas unifyingstyle and content, Fantham (1973) on ‘conciliare’ and Aristotelianethos and (1979) on genus-terminology in articulating arguments, butalso in the arena of law and society, focussing especially on the CausaCuriana, so Tellegen (1983), Vaughn (1985), on the attention paid toCicero’s principles for historiography, so Sinkovitch (1974), Leeman(1984, 1985b), Marchal (1987), Wiseman (1979, 1981), Woodman(1988), Cape (1997), and on the relationship between what we wouldperceive as character and persuasion, so Classen (1986), Schottlaender(1988).The most obvious direction for research on De Oratorein the nextten years will be a continued evaluation of the sources to whichCicero responds, the arguments he makes, the educational model heespouses, and the persuasive mechanisms he demonstrates, all under-taken with a much greater sensitivity to the detailed literary struc-ture of the work.Partitiones Oratoriaehad attracted virtually no attention in our periodoutside the realm of texts and translations. Three exceptions areBroz`ek (1983), who argues that while the first two parts of the bookwere written around 54, the third part came after 46, Grilli (1996)who uses this text towards a Ciceronian theory of political and eth-ical education, and especially Gaines’ radical reinterpretation of thework as a representation of Academic philosophical inquiry into thenature of rhetoric rather than as simply a textbook for the orator’sson (chapter 15 above).De Optimo Genere Oratorumreceives a vote for authenticity as anexample in the elaborate and painstaking discussion of prose rhythmby Berry (1996b). Riggsby (1995) uses it to find Cicero’s attack onthe Atticists as part of an effort to maintain the central position oforatorical persuasion in Roman culture.Over the last twenty-five years, work on theBrutus, already wellserved by the commentary of Douglas (1966), has largely turnedfrom the prosopographical direction so masterfully pursued by Sumner(1973), to consideration of how this history of Roman oratory argues      513MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 513"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"for the role of the orator in Caesar’s new order (esp. Rathofer [1986]),and most interestingly about the shift from spoken to written expres-sion as the chief medium for expressing elite cultural values at theend of the Republic (Narducci [1997]). The problems of the Brutusas a history of oratory as they relate to Cicero’s criteria for the judg-ment, or even inclusion, of earlier speakers have recently been high-lighted by Suerbaum (1996–1997; 1997). More generally, BrutusandOratorhave provided evidence for Cicero’s relationship with his audi-ence (Lucas [1975]) and his view of the primary role of the lay audi-ence in judging oratorical success (Iodice di Martino [1987]; esp.Shenkeveld [1988]).More specific stylistic issues, especially questions of the three styles,their character, and their relationship to the earlier tradition, havebeen principal foci of work on the Orator, so on the middle styleFantham (1988), Winterbottom (1989), Adamik (1995). While theOratorcontains the fullest discussion of prose rhythm, this discussionper sehas drawn little recent attention since it has long been knownthat Cicero’s theory diverges sharply from his practice. Even his the-ory shows a lack of attention to the peripatetic tradition, accordingto Fortenbaugh (1989). Inevitably, the notion of the ideal orator heldup at the beginning of the Oratorhas prompted a revisiting of thePlatonic grounding of that ideal, so Wimmel (1974a), Degli InnocentiPierini (1979).Although Brutus and Oratorare very different in form, the truismthat both are polemical defenses of Cicero’s own style against thecriticisms of the so-called Atticists binds them together as centraltexts in discussions of the history and nature of Roman Atticism andits relationship to Greek Atticism. (For the application of conceptsof Atticism to Cicero’s style, see on style below.) Already at thebeginning of our period, A. E. Douglas (1973) had stressed the lackof monolithic coherence among Atticists. In our period, Th. Gelzer(1979) in the Fondation Hardt volume on Le classicisme à Romepegsthe origins in the classicizing milieu of the second century. Morerecently, J. Wisse (1995, with lit.) has reexamined the evidence, arguedfor a Roman origin for Atticism, redated that origin to around 60B.C.E., explained Atticism as a movement only in the sense of agroup of self-identifying people of similar tastes, and explored themechanisms whereby Roman Atticism becomes Hellenized. E. Narducci(1997) similarly sees the Atticists as a heterogeneous group, and spec-514 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 514"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"ulates that Licinius Calvus himself advanced Demosthenes as a model,but did so in a way that ran afoul of Cicero’s judgment and ora-torical strengths.In the course of his argument that Topica complements PartitionesOratoriae by illustrating the application of philosophical doctrine torhetoric, Gaines (chapter 15 above) also gives an excellent summaryof the current state of scholarship on this work, and marks out theground for further debate.II.B.OrationsII.B.i.Spoken and Published OrationsReal progress has been made in the last twenty-five years on thequestion of the extent to which Cicero’s published orations reflectspeeches actually delivered. While this question cannot be definitivelyresolved, prudent speculation about this question is nonetheless valu-able for scholars with a range of interests, primarily: 1) students ofpersuasion who try to understand the arguments that Romans wouldfind persuasive in an oral context and 2) historians who would usethe published speeches as evidence for fine analysis of Roman civicdiscourse or shifting political circumstances. 3) Students of Ciceroand of Roman political and literary practice who are concerned withthe motives that impel Cicero to publish a given speech at all.The evidence for diversion between spoken and written orations,whether through addition, abbreviation, changes of detail, or thepublication of speeches which were never delivered orally (the ActioSecunda in Verremand the Second Philippic), had been collected longbefore our period (So, e.g., Laurand [1936–1938]: 1–23), and con-tinues to be presented again (most recently, Ledentu [2000]). Forspeeches that correspond to actual oral performances, the exact extentof correspondence between oral and spoken versions is necessarilyspeculative. The question remains whether, in the absence of specificevidence to the contrary, there is any general reason to assume thata speech text that we have differs substantially in content or orga-nization from the spoken oration which it purports to represent.Before our period began, there seemed to be a compelling argu-ment that our texts of judicial speeches could not correspond withspoken orations. Jules Humbert (1925) had argued that the procedure      515MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 515"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"in a Roman criminal trial did not allow continuous speeches, butonly ‘tours de parole,’ which Cicero will have later synthesized andpublished in the form of the texts we have. At the beginning of ourperiod, Humbert’s thesis, long regularly ignored, was successfullyrebutted by Stroh (1975: 31–54). The possibility of general corre-spondence between spoken and published orations would now beargued based upon a sense of Cicero’s motives for publication. Butthose discussions of motives would have to take into account the factthat Cicero published speeches embracing mutually contradictoryviews (on the Gracchi, for example), as well as speeches that appar-ently demonstrate a successful deception of the audience. (ThusCicero’s boast that he had deceived the jury of Cluentius, Quintilian,IO. 2.17.21). Stroh, basing his arguments on Cicero’s own statements,especially in the Brutus, argued that the primary motive for publi-cation was to provide exemplars of how the orator might persuadespecific audiences within specific contexts. Published speeches mightalso serve to espouse political positions, promote the speaker, etc.,but these other motives were subordinate to the pedagogical. WhileStroh explicitly rejected the claim that the published speeches mustreflect what Cicero had actually said, he maintained that they mustrepresent the sorts of arguments and arrangement that Cicero wouldview as effective for persuading an original listening audience. Stroh’semphasis on the pedagogical motive, recently taken up without ref-erence to Stroh by Achard (2000), has been seen as excessive. Crawford(1984, and above, pp. $$) contributed the first consideration ofCicero’s publication activity based a comprehensive picture of hisforensic and political speaking. She concluded that Cicero seems tohave published only about half of his speeches, and that he pub-lished unless there was a reason not to do so. This selection prin-ciple gives much more weight to non-pedagogical motives. Classen(1985: 2–11) provides a concise and balanced overview that givesdue weight to pedagogical motives of providing an example of a suc-cessful oration in given circumstances, and so accounts for contra-dictory passages in different speeches, while properly emphasizingthe political and self-fashioning motives for publication. Riggsby (1999:178–184; v. et. Riggsby [1995b]), cited by May above (chapter 3,n. 2), upon reconsidering the evidence similarly concludes that,although details may be changed, absent specific evidence to thecontrary there is no positive reason to assume substantive differences516 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 516"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"between the argumentation of the spoken and the published versionof a speech. A complementary but independent argument is that ofAlexander (2000) in his discussion of the handling of legal techni-calities. He maintains that these detailed technical discussions wouldnot be later insertions in the published speeches since they wouldbe less important for Cicero’s desired effects on a reading audiencethan for his desired effect on initial listeners.Among individual speeches or groups of speeches, considerationof motives for publication of the Verrines is well discussed by ProfessorVasaly above (90–92). The speeches of the consular corpus men-tioned inAtt. 2.1.3 were treated by Helm (1979) in an attempt toisolate post-delivery changes and additions based primarily upon hisjudgment of the appropriateness of various remarks to 63 or a laterdate. Professor Cape’s discussion (above, 113–120) thoroughly treatsthe questions raised by the consular orations. Moreau (1980) arguedon the basis of internal evidence (Mur. 62) that the publishedProMurena as we have it must be a production of 61 or 60 as well, andthat the reduction of arguments to a rubric at section 57 reflectsCicero’s relationship to Clodius at that time. The other oration thatmost vigorously raises the question of spoken vs. published isProMilone, for which Marshall (1987a) gives insights about the nature ofthe other version that circulated in antiquity, and Stone (1980) pro-vides the most judicious speculation about the relationship of thetext we have to what Cicero might have said, and to the politicalcircumstances that will have influenced the later additions.While the work on spoken vs. published orations over the lasttwenty-five years has had value for detailed political history and forthe understanding of Cicero’s public self-fashioning, its most impor-tant consequence may be that it allows us, even as we acknowledgethat the written text we have is the analysand (so Dyck [1998]) toengage in the imaginative exercise, essential for students of persua-sive process, of treating the speeches as plausible transcripts of oralacts of persuasion before a specific (even if fictive) listening audience.II.B.ii.Persuasive-Process Criticism and Argument from CharacterThe dominant approach to Cicero’s speeches in our period has beenthat signaled by the appearance of Chr. Neumeister’s Grundsätze derforensischen Rhetorik gezeigt an Gerichtsreden Ciceros (1964).Arguing fromthe descriptions of persuasion in De Oratore, Neumeister advanced a      517MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 517"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"notion of persuasive-process criticism that treats a text of a Ciceronianspeech as a record of an oral persuasive process before a given lis-tening audience in specific circumstances. The speech represents anact of progressive manipulation in which every argument, word, andnuance moves towards the orator’s persuasive goal. The fact thatthe orator must speak at all, that the audience is not already per-suaded, indicates that there is some impediment to getting the audi-ence to act or feel as he wants. This is the rhetorical challenge. Thegreater the rhetorical challenge overcome, the greater the success ofthe speech.This approach focuses upon the psychology of the audience, ren-ders the speaker an amoral agent, and requires the critic to take aclear stand about the circumstances that define the context of thespeech and the rhetorical challenge. It is concerned with the rhetor-ical theory of the handbooks and with traditional Roman oratoricalpractice only insofar as they can give information about the expec-tations for a speech that the listening audience might bring to theevent. Likewise the legal grounding of the case and any politicalconsiderations must be weighed, but only as a means to the end ofestablishing the context for the orator’s attempt to persuade.Among the landmark uses of this approach, W. Stroh, in Taxisund Taktik(1975), analyzed the structure and argumentation of ProCaecina, Pro Roscio Comoedo, Pro Tullio, Divinatio in Caecilium, Pro CluentioandPro Caelio In the 1982 Fondation Hardt volume Éloquence etRhétorique chez Cicéron, A. D. Leeman showcased this approach throughan analysis ofPro Murena.In that same volume, C. J. Classen madea unique and important synthesis identifying Ciceronian persuasivetechniques from empirical observations about his argumentation strate-gies gathered from the entire corpus of the speeches. In 1985, Classen’sRecht—Rhetorik—Politikreturned to the focus on the complete analy-sis of the persuasive process in whole speeches, focusing uponProCluentio, Pro Murena, Pro Flacco, De domo sua, De imperio Cn. Pompei, andthe speechesDe lege agraria.After a generation in which the dominant critical approach hasseen the speaker as amoral and manipulative, the impact of suchassumptions on inferences about Roman society is still being nego-tiated. While there has been little exploration of the tensions inCicero’s own theorizing of his sincerity (Narducci [1994–1995] is asignal exception), there have been several celebrations of the ora-tor’s lack of veracity, of which the best developed is that of H. C.518 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 518"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Gotoff(1993 b). The assumption that Cicero regularly dupes hisjuries, then publishes his speeches for a readership including thosejuries, led J. E. G. Zetzel (1994) to argue that the juries could nothave cared about the guilt or innocence of the accused, but simplyrewarded performance with acquittal. This remarkable conclusionhas been refuted by A. Riggsby (1997). But Riggsby’s refutation leavesunclear how we are to comprehend the acceptance of Cicero’s deceit-fulness by his juries/readers. The nature of the jury’s endorsementof Cicero’s veracity thus remains an essential area for further studyboth for students of persuasion and for cultural and social historians.Primarily, if not exclusively, within the context of persuasive-processcriticism, the most studied single type of persuasive tool in our periodhas been Cicero’s character depiction of himself, his clients, his adver-saries and his allies in ways that go far beyond the prescriptions ofthe rhetorical handbooks (cf.Inv.2.32–37; 1.34–36). Borrowing fromAristotle’s ethike pistis, the credibility that comes from the speaker’sself-presentation in the course of the speech, we designate this muchbroader range of persuasive characterizations as ethical argument.Before our period began, G. A. Kennedy (1968) had built upon thefact that Roman courts employed advocates far more regularly thandid Athenian courts to identify a ‘rhetoric of advocacy,’ a series oftechniques whereby Cicero separates himself from or identifies him-self with his client in order to make stronger ethical appeals and tointroduce potentially offensive arguments. The way in which Cicero’stheoretical writings, especially De Oratore, diverge from the Aristoteliannotion ofethike pistishas been particularly well explored by E. Fantham(1973), by J. Wisse in a magisterial study (1989), and by M. CalboliMontefusco (1990, 1992). The influence of the pre-Aristotelian hand-book tradition on Cicero’s views has been argued by Fortenbaugh(1988). Looking to Cicero’s actual oratorical practice, the rhetoric ofadvocacy has been further explored by J. May in an article (1981)and in a book-length account (1988) of the diachronic developmentof Cicero’s persuasive self-presentation using Pro Quinctio, Pro RoscioAmerino, Divinatio in Caecilium, The First Verrine, The Second Catilinarian,Pro Murena, Pro Sulla, Pro Flacco, Pro Sestio, Pro Caelio, Pro Plancio, ProMilone, Pro Ligario, andPhilippics 3 and12. Refining this picture, Cape(1995) on theFourth Catilinarian, illustrates the way in which the ethosof the orator’s role actually constrains his ability to advance arguments.May’s work extends only incidentally to Cicero’s persuasive charac-terization of other principal figures in a speech. Cicero’s integration      519MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 519"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"of his characterizations of the principal figures in a case into his per-suasive strategy is well treated by Kirby on Pro Cluentio(1990), wholabels it ‘the web of ethos.’ Other emphases include Buchheit (1975b)on Chrysogonus as tyrant in Pro Roscio Amerino, Favory (1981) on theuse of slaves in the Verrinesand Philippics, Craig (1986) on Cato inPro Murena, Gotoff(1986) on the prosecutors in Pro Caelio, Schmitz(1985, 1989) on the treatment of witnesses, and Dyer (1990), whooffers a complex argument that the appeal to Caesar inPro Marcellois also a portrait of Caesar that invites the audience to tyrannicide.An especially fruitful subset of persuasive characterization has beenthe study of Cicero’s use of stereotypes to distract the orator’s audi-ences or simply to play upon their prejudices. K. Geffcken (1973)had shown how Cicero used comic stereotypes for persuasive endsin Pro Caelio. In our period, Axer (1980) noted the persuasive use ofa comedic stereotype inPro Roscio Comoedo, and further used thatappropriate comedic tone to account for the stylistic anomalies inthe speech. Salzman (1982), responding to Geffcken, saw Caelius asAttis to Clodia’s Cybele. Vasaly (1985) used urban and rustic stereo-types of Roman comedy to illumine Cicero’s persuasive strategy inPro Roscio Amerino.Axer (1989), arguing for Cicero’s use of alterna-tive ‘communication situations’ beyond those of comic performance,noted the use of a positive gladiator stereotype in Pro Milone.Sussman(1994b, 1998) used Roman comedic stereotypes to explain the invec-tive of the Second Philippic.In a different vein, the latter part of Vasaly’s(1993) book-length study of Cicero’s persuasive uses of place demon-strates the orator’s use of geographic/ethnically based prejudices todiscredit his opponents or their witnesses in Pro Fonteio, Pro Flacco,Pro Scauro, andDe lege agrariaII.2II.B.iii.Cultural and Social HistoryThe analysis of arguments from stereotypes creates a convergence ofpersuasive-process criticism and cultural history by adducing theculture-specific Roman presuppositions, biases, and prejudices thatthe orator harnesses in order to persuade. In the arena of invective,our period has seen a comprehensive general treatment by Koster(1980), and two works which exemplify different ways to analyse the2This last published earlier in Hermes116 (1988): 409–427.520 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 520"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"materials of Cicero’s arguments as a means to understand Romanconceptualizations of societal power structures. G. Achard (1981) usesCicero’s speeches to describe exhaustively an ‘optimate rhetoric’ thatembodies the views of the conservative element of the ruling class.A. Corbeill (1996) uses Ciceronian invective texts to describe theways in which invective is a tool in the competition for prestige andthe ways in which its operation crystallizes the values of the rul-ing elite.More generally, the balance of persuasive-process analysis withsocial history is best exemplified by B. Frier (1985), who marries andleverages persuasive analysis of Pro Caecinaand a discussion of thebirth of the ‘profession’ of jurisconsult. Most recently, A. Riggsby(1999), in an analysis of equal value to persuasive-process critics andsocial and cultural historians, has used the argumentation of all ofCicero’s extant speeches before the standing criminal courts to expli-cate both Roman conceptions of the nature of crime and the groundsthat those conceptions provide for persuasive arguments.II.B.iv.Alternate Critical Models1.The Reader’s Experience of the SpeechGiven the predisposition to see a published speech as an imagina-tive recreation of a (fictive) persuasive performance before a specificlistening audience, discussions of Cicero’s purposes with his primaryreading audiences, such as those of Crawford and others noted under‘Spoken v. Published Orations’ above, leave scope for further work.What is the relationship of form to purpose of a speech text focusedprimarily upon readers? The Actio Secunda in Verrem, as a text thatdoes not correspond to a speech actually delivered, has been the pri-mary focus of approaches to this question. Berger (1978), while deny-ing that the forensic and literary aims of the text can be separated,provides analyses that focus upon the text as a literary experience.The treatment of the Verrinesby Enos (1988), who does not knowBerger, at least attempts to address the relationship of form to pur-pose for the reading audience. Vasaly’s treatment of the Verrines(above, 87–103), and Cape’s treatment of the Catilinariansas a polit-ically purposeful literary ensemble (1991), as well as his discussionof the consular orations in this volume (above, 113–158), exemplifyother possible approaches. Regarding the more specific understand-ing of the persuasive manipulation of the initial reading audience,      521MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 521"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Berger’s work is complemented by Fuhrmann (1990b) who brieflyillustrates the mechanics of ‘fictive Mundlichkeit,’ and especially byNisbet (1992), who offers a close reading of a single page from theVerrines(Verr. 5.92–95) focused upon the processes by which the reader,guided by the author, creates the effects of a fictive oral perfor-mance. These works presage and invite a more systematic attemptto understand in detail the purposes and dynamics of Cicero’s speechesas literary texts.2.The Case of the First CatilinarianIn the last ten years, a fruitful expansion of the criticism of thespeeches both as models of persuasion and as a window on socialvalues has come especially, if not exclusively, in work on Cicero’sFirst Catilinarian. Perhaps because this speech is notoriously difficultto classify in terms of formal rhetoric and notoriously slippery interms of defining a rhetorical challenge, it has invited scholars eitherto expand or to break free from the persuasive-process model whilemaintaining a concern with the historical circumstances of the speech.W. W. Batstone (1994), consciously measuring the speech against thecriteria of persuasive-process criticism, argued that the speech hasno more concrete persuasive goal than affirming Cicero’s consularauthority. Ethical argument thus becomes the end as well as themeans of persuasion. In a clearer divorce from persuasive-processcriticism, D. Konstan (1993) focused upon Ciceronian persuasion interms of assuming what is to be proven, in this case upon Cicero’sspeech as both an assumption and a demonstration of his side’smonopoly on political virtue. Konstan’s analysis is founded in a cri-tique of assumptions about values and in showing how those assump-tions are reinforced and manipulated. The relationship of persuasionto the assertion of values, rather than the overcoming of a rhetori-cal challenge through progressive manipulation of the audience, ishis principal focus. Similarly, T. Habinek (1998) shows how Ciceroappropriates an array of broader cultural themes to reinforce theassumed position that he represents true Roman values, and that hisopponent is literally an icon of an evil counter-culture. These analy-ses differ from a pure deconstruction of implicit values, such as P. Rose’s (1995) penetrating Marxist reading ofDe imperio Cn. Pompei,in that they focus upon the dynamics of persuasion as well as upona critique of the values of speaker and audience. They point theway to a promising direction for future criticism of the orations.522 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 522"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"II.B.v.The Historical Context of PersuasionBecause oratory is historically situated, the work of Roman histori-ans is essential for our understanding of Cicero’s persuasive achieve-ment in the speeches. From this admittedly narrow oratoricalperspective, several works are especially noteworthy. At the begin-ning of our period, Erich Gruen’s Last Generation of the Roman Republic(1974) gives special scrutiny to criminal trials as a source for politi-cal history. In doing so, Gruen provides important background forunderstanding the rhetorical challenges of many of Cicero’s speeches.The sources and outcomes of all the trials in this period have beenusefully collected by Alexander (1990), and David (1992) has used aprosopography of speakers to construct a sociological analysis ofLepatronat judiciaire, of which Cicero is of course the signal example.While it is beyond our present scope to review the current land-scape of scholarship on late republican history, the single most impor-tant general development for understanding the context of Cicero’soratory is the paradigm shift effected by P. A. Brunt (1988, with lit.)and others away from understanding Roman politics as determinedby a strict network of obligations founded in amicitiae, family con-nections, and patron-client relationships. This ‘frozen waste theoryof Roman politics,’ as North (1990) styles it, has given way to amuch more fluid understanding of the obligations which constrainboth political leaders and the participants in the popular assemblies.The most radical expression of this view, argued vigorously by FergusMillar (esp. 1998, with lit.) is that the Roman popular assembliesare much less oligarchically constrained and centered than has beenbelieved, and that the Roman assemblies are in a real sense demo-cratic bodies. The Roman crowd is thus a direct target of persua-sion, and the rhetoric of the contioan important field of study. Thedimensions and dynamics of this field are still being negotiated (seeesp. Pina Polo [1996]). If consensus can be reached, the resultantnew understanding of Cicero’s eight preserved speeches in contiones(De Imperio Cn. Pompei, De lege agrariaII and III, in CatilinamII andIII, Post Reditum ad Quirites, PhilippicsIV and VI), should be a richfield in the coming decade.Several studies of oratorical style, and of the pronouncements onstyle in rhetorical works, have in our period taken a sociological andpolitical slant. Style is here not only a means to achieve persuasionin a specific contest, but a marker of class status or of political      523MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 523"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"posture that reveals the status or the aspirations of the speaker. Thework of Sinclair (1993, 1995) illustrates both these directions. Veryrecently, Krostenko (2001), in explicating the ‘language of social per-formance,’ has traced the interrelation of linguistic usage, views ofGreek culture, and strategies for maintaining social and political dom-inance in the formation of the Latin rhetorical vocabulary and inthe arguments in Cicero’s speeches. While this broadly synthetic workis stimulating and important, it is not clear whether it will inviteothers to follow.From a different perspective, Narducci (1997), who locates Cicero’srhetorical and oratorical achievement within a program to legitimizethe value of Hellenistic culture and increase the capital of its mostvoluble exponent, sees style and theme of Pro Archiaunited to this end.II.B.vi.Cicero’s Oratorical StylesWorks on Cicero’s style may be located on a spectrum defined atone extreme by the purely formal focus upon the elements of expres-sion (whether general and normative or uniquely Ciceronian, whetherconcerned with vocabulary counts or with grandeur), and at theother extreme by the analysis of style as a means of persuasion.Works that move towards this second extreme conceive of style asinseparable from content, and thus virtually impossible to study ina way that can produce useful generalizations. The approach is noless important for that. Works that conceive of style primarily as aclass marker or instantiation of ideology, and thus as evidence forpolitical or cultural history, are noted in the preceding section.On the eve of our period, Michael von Albrecht’s RE Supplementbandarticle on ‘Sprache und Stil’ (1973) set forth in a compendious waythe gains of a century in attending to Cicero’s style per se. His care-ful attention to Cicero’s changing use of vocabulary and syntax wenthand in hand with a judicious, traditional treatment of Cicero’s stylein terms of the three levels of style, and thus showed Cicero’s owndevelopment, both as a unique trajectory based on empirical obser-vations about his vocabulary and syntax and in correspondence withthe normative and somewhat subjective values of the three styles.Von Albrecht also touched upon the two other common norma-tive critical terms for analyzing Cicero’s style, Asianist and Atticist.Work focused upon these norms, which are based upon the descrip-tions offered in theBrutusand Orator, mostly antedates our period,524 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 524"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"and is judiciously treated by G. Calboli in his 1986 ‘Nota diAggiornamento’ to the Italian translation of Norden’s seminal DieAntike Kunstprosa.3In our period, the focus upon Cicero’s relativeAsianism or Atticism in the wake of Brutusand Oratoris treated byCastorina (1975), who analyzes Pro Marcello, Pro Ligario, and thePhilippicswithout offering any summary conclusions. A student ofCastorina, Cipriani (1975) is concerned to trace through the analy-sis of 10 speeches Cicero’s Asianist or Atticist development as mea-sured by relative frequency of subordinate clauses, selected clausulaehe defines as Atticist or Asianist (e.g. double cretic vs. dichoree), andfrequency of 10 arbitrarily selected figures of speech and thought.His mixed results lead him to conclude that Cicero does not movefrom Asianism to Atticism, but to an asianized Atticism in the man-ner of Hegesias.A broader concept of normative traits of style linked to the con-tents of arguments emerges in the work of Stroh (1982) and Wooten(1983) on the ‘Demosthenic’ elements in Cicero’s Philippics. Strohaddresses the much debated question of the extent to whichDemosthenes exercises a greater stylistic influence upon Cicero atthe end of his career. Why should the speeches against Antony belabelled Philippics, even in jest? Unlike the standard work of Weische(1972) showing Cicero’s direct imitation of phrasing and argumentsof the Attic orators, Stroh demonstrates Demosthenic influence throughadducing thematic as well as verbal parallels between Philippics3–14and speeches in the Demosthenic corpus, especially speeches III–XII.These thematic parallels include war against an enemy who is absent,divinely offered opportunity, and the choice of freedom or death.Stroh locates the Demosthenic phrasing and themes of the speechesin the confluence of the political circumstances after Antonius beganthe siege of Mutina with Cicero’s prevenient interest in Demosthenesas a justifying figure in his disagreements with the ‘Atticist’ critics ofhis style. Wooten (1983), who had no opportunity to read Stroh,uses Hermogenes’ analysis and classification of qualities of style keyedto Demosthenes as a touchstone to show what is Demosthenic inCicero’s style. The key to the Demosthenic qualities of Cicero’s stylethat Wooten demonstrates in this way is in the similar structure and,3Scholarship on Atticism as an historical phenomenon is noted in the discussionof work on Cicero’s rhetorica above.      525MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 525"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"more importantly, the parallel intentions of the two orators’ argu-ments. Thus his study, while grounded in a tradition that focusesupon style per seand upon subjective descriptions about the quali-ties of style, is based upon observations of concrete phenomena ofsentence structure and keyed to the role of style in argumentativecontext. Wooten also introduced the idea of the ‘rhetoric of crisis’to describe the polarized situation of Demosthenes against Philip orof Cicero against Antony or, in his modern example, of Churchillagainst the Axis powers. Although the ‘rhetoric of crisis’ proves soubiquitous that it has little analytical power, Wooten’s study is, inits specifics, a sensitive and useful contribution to the role of stylein persuasive process.Most of the work of the last twenty-five years focused upon stylehas been more concerned with what is unique about Cicero’s stylewithout reference to broader norms. And most of this work, whetherconcerned with style per seor with the role of style in argumenta-tive context, has attempted to base judgments of level and tonesquarely upon objectively observable phenomena. Just before ourperiod, W. R. Johnson’s Luxuriance and Economy: Cicero and the AlienStyle(1971) was showing the way to treatment of Latin style thatwould ignore the subjective ancient tripartite scheme of grand, middle,and plain defined by vocabulary, use of figures, tone, and in a gen-eral way, sentence construction, in favor of observations focused uponthe sentence as the primary unit of analysis and supported by objec-tive and statistically quantifiable features of sentence structure. Gotoff(1979), in his stylistic analysis of Pro Archia, rejected as vague andunhelpful the tradtional normative classifications of style, and insteadundertook to characterize what is unique about one of Cicero’s styles,the elaborately periodic, through a sentence-by-sentence analysis ofPro Archia in which he accounts for the syntactic and logical expec-tations aroused and satisfied by virtually every individual sentencecomponent.The general results were to demonstrate Cicero’s abil-ity to sustain the expectations of concinnity and balance even as hedeviates from them and to offer a pedagogically influential methodof experiencing the expectations in a Ciceronian sentence that deep-ens apprecation for Cicero’s choices.Another objectively descriptive approach, debatable in its detailsbut exceptionally promising, has been the continued interest in cola,the smaller units of which longer sentences are comprised. Onceidentified, these units signal at their junctures what could be natural526 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 526"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"pauses in the spoken sentence, and so allow the reader or listenerto experience the Latin sentence in a linear way, with a better appre-ciation of the emphases, parallels, and contrasts that the groupingof these units and the effects of the pauses between them can achieve.The study of the rhythmical cadences at the ends of these units andtheir relationship to the cadences at the end of Cicero’s sentences,which have long been identified and appreciated, opens another areafor the aesthetic appreciation and practical differentiation of variousstyles. Finally, if these smaller units can be acceptably defined, thentheir clausulae can be used, as the clausulae at sentence ends havelong been used, as a significant aid to textual criticism.The problem is in the identification of cola and of their bound-aries. The ancient discussions, especially that of Cicero on membraand incisa in the Orator, provide some guidance but leave much tothe prudential judgment of the individual reader. So A. Primmer(1968), who used the post Reditumspeeches to generate the fullestanalysis of the cadences of cola, and attempted to differentiate theclausulae of the weaker and stronger pauses within the sentence incontradistinction to the clausula at sentence end, relies on syntacticstructures to identify cola, but finally uses the criterion of his ownjudgement of the sense of the utterance.4A more objectively descriptive approach that was poised for useat the beginning of our period was that articulated by Eduard Fraenkelin a series of ‘Kolon und Satz’ studies spanning more than 30 years,and leading to Leseproben aus Reden Ciceros und Catos(1968).5In thethree ‘Kolon und Satz’ studies, Fraenkel had found largely objectivegrammatical and syntactic criteria for identifying cola. Once cola areidentified on these grounds, Fraenkel (1968) concedes the importanceof clausulae for confirming results. Habinek (1985), builds upon thesestudies and confirms colon divisions through citations from ancientgrammarians. These cola are in turn comprised of sentence con-stituents, and in that sense are syntactical rather than simply rhetor-ical. In fact, every rhetorical colon is composed of one or more ofthese grammatical or syntactic cola. While Habinek calls these ‘rhyth-mical cola,’ he takes pains not to characterize them by their proserhythms, since, like Fraenkel, he wants to demonstrate that they can4Whatever the value of Primmer’s data, his conclusions were shown to be sta-tistically unsound by Aili (1979), esp. 25–32.5See also the review by E. Laughton inJRS60 (1970): 188–194.      527MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 527"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"be identified on other, clearer grounds. Unlike Fraenkel, who empha-sizes that cola are a general and basic feature of language, Habinekis concerned to see differing patterns in the use of cola as an ana-lytic tool for a better understanding both of types of style (as heshows with the examples of thetria genera dicendiat ad Her.4.12–16),and of the stylistic effects achieved by individual authors. R. G. M.Nisbet (1990), in a brief but important article, underscores againstHabinek the importance of prose rhythms in defining rhythmicalcola. While Nisbet is concerned with colometry, that is finding nat-ural sense pauses, rather than simply with prose rhythms, he insiststhat prose rhythms are the most important of the several elementsthat identify those sense pauses. He further points to features, espe-cially Cicero’s use of anteconsonantal ‘atque’ to give a better clausula,as a legitimate way in which prose rhythm has a visible effect onour ability to recognize colon boundaries. The notion that an authorputs word choice at the service of rhythms at colon boundaries aswell as at the end of a sentence inevitably will affect the work oftextual critics. D. H. Berry (1996a: 49–54; v. et. 1996b) for hisedition of Pro Sulla, has not only reworked Zielinski’s mass of dataon clausulae at sentence ends, but has used Nisbet’s work, especiallyon anteconsonantal ‘atque,’ in establishing his text of the speech.Meanwhile, the only attempt so far explicitly to describe an entireCiceronian speech on Fraenkel’s principles of colon-division and toanalyze the clausulae of the various cola is Sträterhoff’s 1995 analy-sis of De Imperio Cn. Pompei.6Hutchinson (1995), who also builds uponNisbet’s observation about anteconsonantal ‘atque,’ adds further obser-vations, especially about the presence of rhythmic closes emphasiz-ing important ideas immediately before a final verb. At least asimportant, Hutchinson gives a selective and important demonstra-tion of the ways in which rhythmic closes at colon boundaries canincrease our awareness of the emphases in the close reading of specificpassages.The methodology of the study of prose rhythm focused upon thefinal clausula in the period, well schematized by Dangel (1984), hasalso seen progress in the last twenty-five years, notably the statisti-cal method of Aili (1979), the consideration of what constitutes arhythmic close by Hutchinson (1995), and the important treatment6See Nisbet’s review inCR47.2 (1997): 311–313.528 . MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 528"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"by Berry (1996b) of the uniqueness or genre-dependence of an author’sprose rhythms and the proper interpretation of clausula preferencesin authenticity studies.Next under the heading of style we must mention those variousobservations about the ways in which students of persuasive processnote that choices about expression reinforce argument. In general,some commentary on stylistic reinforcement of arguments, whetherat the level of choice of vocabulary, sentence construction, or largermechanisms for establishing nuances and so manipulating audienceresponse, is a standard feature of persuasive-process criticism, as itwas already in Neumeister’s stylistic analysis of Pro Milone(1964:156–200).The most dramatic conclusion in this arena is that of Axer (1980)who argues that the stylistic features of Pro Roscio Comoedoneed notbe explained by some notion of Cicero’s diachronic stylistic devel-opment, and certainly cannot be used to date the work, becausethey are in fact stylistic features borrowed from the Roman Comedyof which Cicero’s client was the age’s most famous performer.From a different focal level, the brief observations of Classen inhis attempt to generalize Cicero’s persuasive tactics (1982: 177–183)are especially valuable. As he observes, a book could be written onthe subject of the relationship of style to persuasion. As Classen alsonotes, and later exemplifies in his discussion of Pro Murena(1985:120–179), the key to discussion of style as a means of persuasion isexactly the interrelation of stylistic phenomena with a unique per-suasive context. As a result, any synthesis runs an immediate risk ofseeming reductive and dubious.Gotoff’s Cicero’s Caesarian Speeches: A Stylistic Commentary(1993) avoidsthose pitfalls. An avowedly pedagogical work for students of Cicero’sstyle, it is concerned to explicate through a close reading the waysin which Cicero’s choice of words and expressions, the structure ofhis sentences, and occasionally his choice of prose rhythms, serve hispersuasive goals before an exceptionally bright and rhetorically sophis-ticated audience—Julius Caesar. To the extent that the work sus-tains this focus, it is a felicitous extension of work on the importanceof style for persuasive argument. That said, Gotoff’s stylistic obser-vations more often form an empirical characterization of Ciceronianusage as style per se, rather in the manner of a (very useful) philo-logical commentary. It should also be noted that this work, to theextent that it is explicitly keyed to a notion of persuasive process,      529MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 529"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"must rest on assumptions about the relationship of Cicero and Caesar,and upon an understanding of the political situation at the time ofeach speech, that are open to disagreement. This underscores againthe need for basic, comprehensive commentaries on individual speechesas a foundation for further work.S. Cerutti’s book-length examination of the exordiaof Pro Quinctio,Pro Roscio Amerino, Pro Murena, Pro Milone, Pro Rege Deiotaroand theSecond Philippicclaims to identify an ‘accretive style’ mandated by therhetorical expectations for the exordium, and consisting in the estab-lishment of fundamental oppositions attached to certain ‘conceptwords’ which, through their repetition, allow the bundling of globaljudgments about good and bad character to be attached to thestances of the opposing sides. The use of specific figures of thought,which are usually conceived of as formal elements of style, to advanceCicero’s persuasive goals informs the work of Kirby (1990). As partof a critical approach to Pro Cluentiobased upon the five officia ora-torisand upon Aristotle’s entechnoi pisteis, he treats the figures of antithe-sis, metaphor, and praeteritioin that speech in a way that shows howthey help to achieve Cicero’s persuasive goals. Craig (1993) estab-lishes the audience expectations for one figure of thought, the dilemma,demonstrates the ways in which Cicero exploits those expectationsto persuade in individual persuasive contexts in several speeches, andends with generalizations about the persuasive functions of the device.Since all of Cicero’s speeches, and in fact all of classical Latin lit-erature to 200 C.E., has been accessible since 1991 on the PackardHumanities Institute CD-ROM 5.3, questions about Ciceronian vocab-ulary usage and word collocation can now find exhaustive answersissuing from a scholar’s desk-top computer. Citation of this resourcehas now become commonplace in any article touching upon Ciceronianword usage. Perhaps because the ease of retrieval of these data makesconclusions drawn from them less prized, publication of specificallycomputer-based work on Ciceronian vocabulary and usage is still inthe future. One exception of questionable value is the collection ofmetaphors (dead and alive) that form the bulk of the treatment of‘rhetoric’ in P. MacKendrick’s selective and idiosyncratic handbook,The Speeches of Cicero(1995). Similarly in the future, as scholars learnmore about the sorts of questions that machine-readable texts canbe made to answer, may come stylistic analyses based upon lengthof cola and internal sentence rhythms. Certainly figures of speech,if not figures of thought, will be exhaustively catalogued.

All ofthese directions, some supported by a more sophisticated use of thecomputer-assisted analytical tools now available, show promise forfuture research.      531MAY_f18_502-531 7/11/02 8:59 PM Page 531"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"533BIBLIOGRAPHYcompiled by Christopher P.

The works are listed in chronologicalorder (in places disputable). Following the custom of l’Année philologique, the texts,translations and commentaries are listed first (the “A” list), followed by all otherworks, including text-critical notes (the “B” list.) It is important to note that biogra-phies of Cicero and extensive treatments of the political history of the period, e.g,E. S. Gruen’sLast Generation of the Roman Republic (1974), are not cited under indi-vidual speeches. These works must still be consulted by all who want a sound knowl-edge of the current state of our understanding of Cicero’s speeches and rhetorica.M. C.
